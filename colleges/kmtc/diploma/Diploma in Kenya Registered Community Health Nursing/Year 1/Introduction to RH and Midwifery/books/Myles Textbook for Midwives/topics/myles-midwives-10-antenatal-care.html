                        <p>Antenatal care is the care given to a pregnant woman from the time conception is confirmed until the beginning of labour. The midwife facilitates woman-centred care by providing her with accessible and relevant information to help her make informed choices throughout pregnancy. The foundation of this process is the development of a trusting relationship in which the midwife engages with the woman and listens to her story.</p>

                        <h3>Historical background</h3>
                        <p>Antenatal care has been provided in the United Kingdom (UK) for almost a century and was first offered in the late 1920s (Ministry of Health 1929). The model of antenatal care followed a regime of monthly visits until 28 weeks’ gestation, then fortnightly visits until 36 weeks, then weekly visits until the birth of the baby. This model continued for decades but was eventually challenged in the 1980s by Hall et al (1980), whose retrospective analysis demonstrated that conditions requiring hospitalization, including pre-eclampsia, were neither prevented nor detected by antenatal care; and intrauterine growth restriction was over-diagnosed. It was felt that reducing visits for those who did not need them would mean that more support could be given to vulnerable women to improve their outcomes.</p>
                        <p>To evaluate the impact of reduced antenatal visiting, Sikorski et al (1996) conducted a randomized controlled trial, with low-risk pregnant women, to compare the acceptability and effectiveness of a reduced antenatal visit schedule of six to seven routine visits with the traditional 13 routine visits. No differences in clinical outcome between the two groups were found, but twice as many women in the reduced-visit group were dissatisfied with the frequency of attendance, compared with women who received the full range of visits. The World Health Organization trialled a system of four routine antenatal visits for women assessed as being low risk (Villar et al 2001). They found no statistically significant differences between the outcomes of pre-eclampsia, severe anaemia, urinary tract infection and low birth-weight infants between the intervention group and standard care, in the 24,678 women enrolled in the study.</p>
                        <p>Patterns of visiting continue to be investigated and Dowswell et al (2010) compared standard care with reduced visiting schedules investigated in seven randomized controlled trials. They concluded that for high income countries there was no difference between the groups but for low to medium income countries, perinatal mortality was increased in those receiving reduced visits and the authors conclude that visits should not be reduced without close monitoring of the impact on neonatal outcome. As previous research had demonstrated (Clement et al 1996; Villar et al 2001), women prefer more scheduled visits, but as outlined in National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (2008) guidance, women who had a midwife willing to spend time with them and encourage them to ask questions were more likely to be satisfied with reduced visits than those whose midwife did not offer this.</p>
                        <p>NICE (2003, 2008) has endorsed a schedule of seven visits for parous women and 10 for primigravid women and this pattern is often reflected in the service specification commissioned (see Box 10.2 for the NICE 2008 recommended visiting pattern). The midwife must continue to use her knowledge and judgement when providing care, as there will be situations where deviation from the pathway will be necessary to ensure safety for either the woman or her unborn baby. In such situations, the midwife should clearly document her rationale and ensure that she continues to evaluate the care she provides or has requested from other members of the team. If the deviation falls outside the midwife’s current remit, she is obliged to ‘call such health or social care professionals as may reasonably be expected to have the necessary skills and experience to assist you in the provision of care’ (Nursing and Midwifery Council [NMC] 2012: 15).</p>

                        <h3>Current practice</h3>
                        <p>National evidence-based guidelines, in relation to antenatal care have been developed and circulated in the UK since 2003. They were updated in 2008 and reviewed again in 2011 when it was decided that there was insufficient new evidence to warrant a change. They are next due for review in 2014.</p>
                        <p>In addition to full national clinical guidance, NICE also produce ‘Quality Standards’ that are ‘a concise set of statements designed to drive and measure priority quality improvements within a particular area of care’ (NICE 2012). The Antenatal Quality Standard comprises 12 statements and these are detailed in Box 10.3. They are a useful framework for examining maternity services and provide benchmarks for audit and commissioning purposes, although most of them relate to women with risk factors.</p>
                        <h3>Public health role of the midwife</h3>
                        <p>Midwives have always held a privileged position in relation to their ability to influence the health and wellbeing of women and their families. With access to women at a time in their life when they may be open to change their behaviour to achieve a healthy baby, midwives can offer support, information and referral. The public health remit of the midwives was strengthened when their unique position to address inequality was formally recognized in the government White Paper Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation (Department of Health [DH] 1999). It has since been recognized as a significant part of the midwife’s role and deeply embedded in the Midwifery 2020 strategy (McNeill et al 2010) and future government policy (DH & National Health Service [NHS] Commissioning Board 2012).</p>
                        <p>There are a range of health behaviours that impact on life chances and these follow a social gradient. By addressing these public health issues and working together with other agencies, midwives can influence the future health of the population. Extending the boundaries of midwifery care to offer social support can result in positive outcomes in terms of lifestyle, employment and the growth and development of children (Leamon and Viccars 2007). The Marmot Review (2010) examined strategies that could be implemented in order to reduce inequalities in health. It focused on the challenges people face throughout the life course and highlighted the importance of children getting ‘the best start in life’ (2010: 173). It identified the need to give priority to maternal health interventions and evidence-based parenting support programmes, children’s centres, advice and assistance.</p>

                        <h3>Access to care</h3>
                        <p>Early contact with the maternity services, ideally by 10 weeks’ gestation, is important so that appropriate and valuable advice relating to screening, nutrition and optimum care of the developing fetus can be given. Medical conditions, infections and lifestyle behaviours may all have a profound and detrimental effect on the fetus during this time.</p>
                        <p>Women are encouraged to access their midwife through their local health or children’s centre on confirmation or suspicion of a positive pregnancy test and should be facilitated to do this. They do not require a formal referral from a General Practitioner (GP). It has been a longstanding conundrum that the people who are most likely to need or benefit from health services are least likely to access them. Often referred to as ‘hard to reach’ groups, it might be more accurate to describe some services as ‘hard to reach’ and particularly useful to do this when considering how access to services can be increased.</p>
                        <p>Late booking for antenatal care has been recognized as a feature of many maternal deaths (Lewis 2007; CMACE [Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries] 2011a). The recent Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths (CMACE 2011a) noted improvement and applauded the fact that recommendations from previous Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths reports are being acted on. However, late booking and poor attendance remains a feature of many maternal deaths. Indeed, $87\%$ of the population at the time of the report had booked by 13 weeks’ gestation (DH 2010a) compared with $58\%$ of the women who died from Direct and Indirect causes.</p>
                        <p>For some women, late booking cannot be avoided if they have arrived only recently in the country. However, these women are particularly vulnerable as they may be naive about how maternity services work, not knowing where they are located, be unable to negotiate public transport and not speak English. Services can be made more accessible if community-based outreach workers and bilingual link/advocacy workers recruited from the target population are employed to provide care (Hollowell et al 2012).</p>
                        <p>Maternity services can also be difficult to access for indigenous women. They may not recognize the importance of attending early for care to enable valuable health and social care screening to be undertaken. They may be juggling childcare demands with work and financial pressures. Centralization of services may mean that the consultant maternity unit is located in towns or cities, many miles from home. Whilst low-risk women receive the majority of their care in the community, closer to home, for those where there is a complication or a medical condition that requires close monitoring, regular attendance at the consultant unit can be a real challenge.</p>
                        <p>A flexible approach to the timing of visits and the place of consultation has been incorporated into many maternity services to address issues of access, choice and maternal satisfaction (DH 2007). However, it is equally important that women perceive antenatal care as a valuable resource and an opportunity to receive effective, relevant care from staff who treat them with respect and kindness.</p>
                        <h3>Models of midwifery care</h3>
                        <p>Women can choose from a variety of midwifery care options depending on local availability and their level of risk. The majority of low-risk women receive antenatal care in the community, either at a Children’s Centre, GP surgery, or in their own home. Hospital- or communitybased clinics are available for women who receive care from an obstetrician or physician in addition to their midwife. Midwifery teams, case loading and independent midwifery (IM) are all examples of how antenatal care can be provided flexibly to meet the needs of individual women. In the UK from early in 2014 IMs will be required to have professional indemnity insurance (PII) for all aspects of midwifery care. The NMC Midwifery Order 2001 will be amended, giving the NMC the power to refuse the right to registration or remove from the register any IM who does not have PII cover (DH 2013).</p>
                        <p>Options for place of birth include the home, a birth centre (stand-alone or alongside) or a consultant-led unit. National maternity policy promotes birth at home as an option for all women with low-risk pregnancies (DH 2007), but fundamental to this is women’s choice and local configuration of services. Women who have identified risk factors or develop complications during pregnancy will usually plan for a hospital birth. However, some women with potentially complex needs may request midwifery-led care, for a range of reason. They should have the opportunity to discuss their hopes and expectations so that a mutually acceptable plan can be agreed, and supported by appropriately skilled midwives.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The purpose of this visit is to initiate the development of a trusting relationship that facilitates the positive engagement of the woman with the maternity service; this is the most important element of antenatal care. Whilst it is crucial that risk assessment and identification of clinical relevant information is obtained, none of these can be undertaken if the woman does not feel able to communicate with the midwife.</p>
                        <h3>Meeting the midwife</h3>
                        <p>The woman’s first introduction to midwifery care is crucial in forming her initial impressions of the maternity service. A friendly, professional approach will enable the development of a positive partnership between the woman and the midwife. The initial visit focuses on the exchange of information (Box 10.4) and identification of factors that may require referral to another member of the multi-professional team (Box 10.5). It is a key opportunity for the midwife and the woman to get to know each other. The midwife may meet other members of the family and in this way gain a more informed view of the woman’s circumstances. However, the midwife will also recognize that there are occasions when the woman may need to spend time alone with her to facilitate discussion, which she may not feel able to have in the presence of family members.</p>

                            </ul>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Communication</h3>
                        <p>The midwife requires many skills to provide optimal antenatal care: fundamentally, the ability to communicate effectively and sensitively. Listening skills involve focusing on what the woman is saying and how she is saying it, considering the content and tone. In addition, non-verbal responses, including facial expression, body position and eye contact, will influence the quality of the interaction and have the potential to enhance or detract from the development of a positive relationship between woman and midwife (Allison 2012).</p>
                        <p>The midwife can promote communication with the woman during discussion by gentle questioning, openended statements and reflecting back keywords from what is said, to encourage and facilitate exploration of what is meant (Rungapadiachy 1999). Midwives also need to be aware of the language they use, avoiding unnecessary jargon and technical language (Lucas 2006). Communication encompasses writing accurate, comprehensive and contemporaneous records of information given and received and the plan of care that has been agreed (NMC 2009). The midwife must also communicate relevant information with the multiprofessional team (NMC 2008) and with the GP and health visitor in particular (CMACE 2011a).</p>
                        <p>Taking an antenatal booking history involves a lot of questioning and data collection. However, in completion of the documentation the midwife must be mindful that she needs to have eye contact with the woman in order to facilitate discussion and observe her responses to particular questions. General conversation about the woman’s experiences can be a more useful way of sharing information between woman and midwife compared with asking a list of questions or filling in computer data in a mechanistic manner (McCourt 2006).</p>

                        <h3>Personal information</h3>
                        <p>As part of getting to know each other the midwife will introduce herself as the woman’s named midwife. She will then clarify the woman’s name and the relationship to her of anyone accompanying her. Important details such as date of birth, address and current occupation are written down and provide a useful means of breaking the ice. The woman’s age should be considered in relation to local guidelines. For example, it may be a recommendation that women who are 40 years of age or more are offered induction of labour at term (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologist [RCOG] 2013a). If this is the case, the woman will need to know what her care pathway will be so that she can be fully involved in all decisions. The midwife will explain that she will be asking lots of questions and encourage the woman to ask if anything is unclear.</p>
                        <h3>Social circumstances</h3>
                        <p>It is useful to explore the woman’s response to the pregnancy. Some women may be overwhelmed by having to care for a new baby along with other children, they may be isolated or living in poverty. The woman may be a teenager, and experiencing conflict with her parents, social stigma and accommodation concerns. The midwife will need to have a contemporary knowledge of local services and initiatives, such as the Family-Nurse Partnership for pregnant teenagers (DH 2010b), social services and voluntary agencies to make appropriate referrals, in partnership with the woman.</p>
                        <p>Many women live in complex circumstances and the midwife will sometimes need to ask a range of questions to untangle the details. For example, what are their living arrangements, are there any children from previous relationships and who has custody, to identify if there are any child protection concerns that may need further follow up.</p>
                        <p>If the woman appears to have difficulty understanding information that is being given, she may have a learning disability or difficulty. It is important to liaise closely with her GP to establish if any diagnosis has been made. Further referral and engagement with social care services may be necessary to ensure that appropriate advocacy and assessment is put in place. There are also many useful visual aids that can support communication where written word is inappropriate.</p>
                        <p>Domestic abuse is also a possible concern, with a prevalence of $5\%$ to $21\%$ in pregnancy (Leneghan et al 2012). It is important for the midwife to explore this issue sensitively and be aware of the signs or symptoms of domestic abuse. The woman may only disclose information if she is alone hence the midwife should endeavour to provide such opportunities and do so in a secure environment (NICE 2008). Support can then be offered in collaboration with the multi-agency team.</p>
                        <p>It may become clear that the woman and her unborn baby are potentially vulnerable, for a range of reasons. It is important that the midwife does not display a negative attitude to vulnerable women as this can be a barrier for future access to care (NICE 2010a). There are a range of agencies that can be engaged to provide additional support, including link workers, social workers, health visitors and doulas, depending on local provision. The midwife may need to consider implementation of the Common Assessment Framework (CAF) process in order to make the most appropriate request for additional services (Department for Education [DfE] 2012). This should be undertaken after the booking appointment in line with local policy and with the mother’s consent. Any immediate cause for concern should be escalated in line with national guidelines and local policy.</p>
                        <h3>Menstrual history and expected date of birth</h3>
                        <p>The next topic of conversation is the reason that has brought the woman to this appointment. An accurate menstrual history helps determine the expected date of birth (EDB), enables the midwife to predict a birth date and subsequently calculate gestational age at any point in the pregnancy. This is particularly important for the timing of fetal anomaly screening and measuring fetal growth.</p>
                        <p>The EDB is calculated by adding 9 calendar months and 7 days to the date of the first day of the woman’s last menstrual period (known as Naegele’s Rule). This method assumes that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the woman takes regular note of regularity and length of time between periods;</li>
                            <li>conception occurred 14 days after the first day of the last period; this is true only if the woman has a regular 28-day cycle;</li>
                            <li>the last period of bleeding was true menstruation; implantation of the ovum may cause slight bleeding;</li>
                            <li>breakthrough bleeding and anovulation can be affected by the contraceptive pill thus impacting on the accuracy of a last menstrual period (LMP).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The duration of pregnancy based on Naegele’s rule is 280 days. However, if the woman has a 35 -day cycle then 7 days should be added; if her cycle is less than 28 days then the appropriate number of days is subtracted. A definitive EDB will be given when the woman attends for her ‘dating’ ultrasound scan at around 12 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
                        <h3>Obstetric history</h3>
                        <p>Previous childbearing history is important in considering the possible outcome of the current pregnancy and also in relation to how the woman feels about the future. In order to give a summary of a woman’s childbearing history, the descriptive terms gravida and para are used. ‘Gravid’ means ‘pregnant’, gravida means ‘a pregnant woman’, and a subsequent number indicates the number of times she has been pregnant regardless of outcome. ‘Para’ means ‘having given birth’; a woman’s parity refers to the number of times that she has given birth to a child, live or stillborn, excluding termination of pregnancy. A grande multigravida is a woman who has been pregnant five times or more, irrespective of outcome. A grande multipara is a woman who has given birth five times or more.</p>
                        <h4>Previous childbearing experiences</h4>
                        <p>A sympathetic non-judgemental approach is required to elicit information and encourage the woman to talk freely about her experiences of previous births, miscarriages or terminations. Confidential information may be recorded in a clinic-held summary of the pregnancy and not in the woman’s handheld record if she requests this. Where a woman has had a previous traumatic birth experience, subsequent pregnancy may evoke panic and fear (Nilsson et al 2010). This impending birth has the potential to heal or harm and the woman may benefit from being able to talk through what happened and/or engage with a psychological intervention to enable her to achieve closure (Beck and Watson 2010). Where a woman or her partner has lost a child due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or has a close relative who has had this experience, she is likely to be very anxious about the prospect of this happening again. Care of the Next Infant (CONI) is a programme of support facilitated by The Lullaby Trust (previously Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths FSID) and provided by health visitors (Lullaby Trust 2013). Eligible parents are offered training in resuscitation, monitoring equipment and extra visits and it is paramount that they are referred to the scheme in the antenatal period to ensure that this care can be facilitated in a timely way to allay anxiety.</p>
                        <p>Repeated spontaneous fetal loss may indicate such conditions as genetic abnormality, hormonal imbalance or incompetent cervix (see Chapter 12). The woman and her partner are likely to be worried about the pregnancy and continuity of carer in these circumstances will be particularly valuable. If there is a history of unexplained stillbirth, the woman should be referred for obstetric antenatal care (RCOG 2010). Some maternity units have special clinics for women who have experienced late fetal loss and most have some means of alerting staff that a woman has previously lost a baby, often with tear-drop sticker in the hospital case notes (SANDS [Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society] 2012). Staff do need to be mindful of painful anniversaries and be prepared for parents to express a range of emotions, depending on their own particular circumstances (Chapter 26).</p>
                        <h3>Medical and surgical history</h3>
                        <p>During pregnancy both the mother and the fetus may be affected by a medical condition, or a medical condition may be altered by the pregnancy; if untreated there may be serious consequences for the woman’s health (CMACE 2011a). For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Women with a history of thrombosis are at greater risk of recurrence during pregnancy, more when over 30 years; have a Body Mass Index (BMI) over 25; have prolonged bed rest; a family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE); have a caesarean birth or travel by air (Farquharson and Greaves 2006). Thromboembolism is the second highest cause of direct maternal death in the UK (CMACE 2011a). All women should have a documented risk assessment for VTE at booking, using a structured tool, and repeated if hospitalized (RCOG 2009). Appropriate thromboprophylaxis and expert referral can be initiated depending on the level of risk identified (Chapter 13).</li>
                            <li>Hypertensive disorders encompass gestational hypertension (pre-eclampsia and eclampsia) and chronic/essential hypertension. Essential hypertension is the underlying factor in $90\%$ of chronic cases (Walfish and Hallak 2006). NICE (2010b) have produced evidence-based guidelines to support monitoring, referral and care (Chapter 13).</li>
                            <li>Other conditions, including asthma, epilepsy, infections and psychiatric disorders may require medication, which may adversely affect fetal development. Suicide is a leading cause of maternal death (Lewis 2007; CMACE 2011a), therefore any psychiatric illness prior to the pregnancy must be fully explored so that the most appropriate multidisciplinary care can be offered (NICE 2007) (see Chapter 25). Major medical complications such as diabetes and cardiac conditions require the involvement and support of a medical specialist (Chapter 13).</li>
                            <li>Previous surgery should be documented as it may highlight previous problems with anaesthesia or other conditions or complications of relevance. Any surgery of the spine should be noted as this may have an impact on the woman’s ability to have an epidural or spinal in labour. Breast surgery may impact on her ability to breastfeed depending on the technique involved. Previous pelvic or abdominal surgery may have consequences requiring specialist advice.</li>
                            <li>The woman should be asked if she is taking any medication, either prescribed or over the counter. She should be advised not to take supplements that contain vitamin A and seek advice from the pharmacist before taking any medication throughout pregnancy and when breastfeeding.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Family history</h3>
                        <p>Birth outcomes are multifactorial and may relate to familial or ethnic predisposition as well as economic and social deprivation. The risk of black and Asian mothers having a stillbirth is 2.1 and 1.6 respectively when compared to white mothers (CMACE 2011b). Black African and black Caribbean women have a significantly higher maternal mortality rate than white women, although the trend is declining. Overall, $42\%$ of direct deaths were from minority ethnic or black groups and 1 in 10 maternal deaths were to non-English speaking woman (CMACE 2011a).</p>
                        <p>Genetic disease in the baby is more likely to occur if the biological parents are close relatives such as first cousins. In a large prospective study (Bundey and Aslam 1993), it is reported that the prevalence of recessive disorders in European babies was $0.28\%$, compared with $3\%$ in the British Pakistanis in the study. Hence, while there is an increased risk of recessive genetic disorders in babies born to married cousins, most babies are healthy. However, there is a lack of information for parents at risk and they face the additional barriers of fear, stigma and language barriers (Khan et al 2010). Where it has been identified that a couple are first cousins, genetic counselling should be offered.</p>
                        <p>Diabetes, although not inherited, leads to a predisposition in other family members, particularly if they become pregnant or obese. Screening for gestational diabetes is now recommended for women with a BMI of 30 or more; previous baby weighing 4.5 kg or more; previous gestational diabetes and/or first-degree relative with diabetes (NICE 2008). Hypertension also has a familial component and multiple pregnancy has a higher incidence in certain families. Some conditions such as sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia are more common in those of black Caribbean, African-Caribbean, African, Pakistani, Cypriot, Bangladeshi and Chinese ethnicity (NICE 2008); and the Family Origin Questionnaire (FOQ) is used at the booking visit to screen couples at risk (Chapter 11).</p>
                        <h3>Lifestyle</h3>
                        <h4>Healthy eating</h4>
                        <p>General health should be discussed and good habits reinforced, giving further advice when required. All women should be provided with information about healthy eating, and vitamin D supplementation (10 micrograms per day) is suggested for all women during pregnancy and breastfeeding to maintain bone and teeth health (NICE 2008). Particular recommendation should be given to women at risk of deficiency (NICE 2008). Women should take 400 micrograms of folic acid each day prior to pregnancy and until 12 weeks’ gestation to reduce the risk of a neural tube defect. Some women, such as those on anticonvulsant medication, especially sodium valproate, are at increased risk of having a fetus affected by a neural tube defect. In such cases it is recommended that the woman consults her GP and takes a higher dose of 5 milligrams ($5 \mathrm{mg}$) of folic acid.</p>
                        <p>The midwife should advise the woman about eating a balanced diet during pregnancy and not ‘eating for two’ (NICE 2010c). It is currently not recommended that women attempt to lose weight during pregnancy. Women should also be informed about which foods they should avoid, e.g. pate, liver products and soft cheeses; food to limit, e.g. tuna, caffeine; and foods where precaution is needed, e.g. sushi and eggs. Full details can be found on the Food Standards Agency (2013) website.</p>
                        <h4>Exercise</h4>
                        <p>NICE (2010c) require health professionals to discuss how physically active a woman is at her first antenatal visit, providing her with tailored information and advice. Usual aerobic or strength conditioning exercise should be continued (RCOG 2006). Not only will this enhance general wellbeing, but also reduce stress and anxiety and prepare the body for the challenge of labour. Any activity that can cause trauma or physical injury to the woman or fetus should be avoided (RCOG 2006). In addition, NICE (2010c) also recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate activity each day, keeping sedentary activities to a minimum. Sexual intercourse during pregnancy may continue and has been found to reduce the likelihood of preterm labour between 29 and 36 weeks (Sayle et al 2001).</p>
                        <h4>Smoking</h4>
                        <p>Approximately $13.3\%$ of women are smokers at the time they give birth (DH 2011), however the rate varies between cities and between wards within cities. Some women may be ready to cut down or give up smoking, while others may not want to change their smoking behaviour (Prochaska 1992). The midwife can be influential in motivating the woman to quit smoking by complying with NICE guidelines (2010d). She should offer carbon monoxide (CO) screening to all women at each antenatal contact and refer women to a stop smoking service if they smoke or their CO level is 7 parts per million (ppm) or more. This provides an opportunity to provide nonjudgemental advice and support (Grice and Baston 2011). Smoking in pregnancy is associated with birth defects (Huckshaw et al 2011) and a range of conditions that compromise the infant’s health and wellbeing including: low birth weight, intellectual impairment, respiratory dysfunction, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and premature birth (Godfrey et al 2010).</p>
                        <p>Nicotine replacement therapy should be discussed with women having difficulty quitting smoking (NICE 2010d) but only used if she is abstaining from smoking. The woman, her partner and other family members should be informed about the direct and passive effects of smoking on the baby and aim to have a smoke-free home. Family members should be directed to Stop Smoking Services as living with a smoker makes it very difficult for pregnant women to quit (Koshy et al 2010).</p>
                        <h4>Alcohol and drug misuse</h4>
                        <p>The effects of excessive maternal alcohol on the fetus are marked, particularly in the 1st trimester when fetal alcohol syndrome can develop. This syndrome consists of restricted growth, facial abnormalities, central nervous system problems, behavioural and learning difficulties and is entirely preventable (Thackray and Tifft 2001). It is recommended that pregnant women abstain from alcohol during the first trimester and drink no more than one to two UK units once or twice a week thereafter (NICE 2008). The midwife also needs to ask prospective parents if they take illicit drugs, regardless of their social status. Many maternity units have a substance misuse team that can support the care of women who abuse alcohol/drugs. Such care should be provided by a named midwife or doctor who has specialized knowledge and experience in this field (NICE 2010a).</p>
                        <h3>Risk assessment</h3>
                        <p>The booking assessment shapes the direction of a woman’s antenatal pathway. It is where her ‘risk status’ (CMACE 2011a) is determined and appropriate referral made. The information gathered regarding the woman’s obstetric, medical and social history and current pregnancy enables the midwife to assess her risk status. The midwife must also seek additional information from the GP (CMACE 2011a) and access previous case notes to elicit all the relevant information. If a risk factor is identified (see Box 10.4) the woman should be referred to a consultant obstetrician, who will discuss a plan for care for her based on the need to access additional expertise and resources. Place of birth may also be influenced by the risk assessment but in all cases the ultimate decision is taken by the woman. Where a woman choses a path of care that could cause significant harm to her or her baby, the midwife should discuss the evidence with her, document these discussions and inform someone in authority of her concerns (NMC 2008: 5). The midwife should listen to a woman’s rationale for requesting a particular path of care and respect her right to decline treatment (NMC 2008:3). Advice can always be sought from a supervisor of midwives, 24 hours a day (NMC 2012).</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-3" class="section-heading">

                        <span class="heading-text">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Prior to conducting the physical examination of a pregnant woman, her consent and comfort are primary considerations. Observation of physical characteristics is important. Poor posture and gait can indicate back problems or previous trauma to the pelvis. The woman may be lethargic, which could be an indication of extreme tiredness, anaemia, malnutrition or depression. It is therefore important to look holistically at the woman and her family and assess fetal growth and development by recognized markers in conjunction with this knowledge.</p>
                        <h3>Weight</h3>
                        <p>Obesity is literally a growing problem, with approximately $16\%$ of women starting pregnancy with a BMI of $30 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ (Heslehurst et al 2010). There are no evidence-based UK guidelines regarding what constitutes normal weight gain in pregnancy (NICE 2010c). However, in the United States (US) it is recommended that women of normal BMI should gain between 11.5 and 16 kg (Rasmussen and Yaktine 2009). Referral to an obstetrician should be made if the woman’s BMI is &lt;18 $\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ or $\geq 30 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ (NICE 2008). Women with a BMI in the obese range are more at risk of complications of pregnancy. These may include gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and shoulder dystocia. There may also be difficulty in palpating the fetal parts and defining presentation, position or engagement of the fetus. Overweight or underweight women should be carefully monitored, have additional care from an obstetrician, and be offered appropriate support, including nutritional counselling within the multiprofessional team (see Chapter 13). Women with a BMI of 30 or more should be offered a glucose tolerance test. There is emerging evidence (Thangaratinam et al 2012) that maternal and neonatal outcomes can be improved by lifestyle and dietary interventions that reduce maternal weight gain, but is currently not advised to lose weight during pregnancy.</p>
                        <h3>Blood pressure</h3>
                        <p>Blood pressure is taken in order to ascertain normality and provide a baseline reading for comparison throughout pregnancy. Systolic blood pressure does not alter significantly in pregnancy, but diastolic falls in mid-pregnancy and rises to near non-pregnant levels at term. The systolic recording may be falsely elevated if a woman is nervous or anxious, if a small cuff is used on a large arm, the arm is unsupported or if the bladder is full. The woman should be comfortably seated or resting in a lateral position on the couch for the measurement. Brachial artery pressure is highest when the subject is sitting and lower when in the recumbent position. Current opinion is that Korotkoff V should be used (Walfish and Hallak 2006).</p>
                        <h3>Urinalysis</h3>
                        <p>At the first visit the woman should be offered screening to exclude asymptomatic bacteriuria (NICE 2008; NSC [National Screening Committee] 2012a). Because the condition is asymptomatic the woman is unaware of disease; treatment could reduce the risk of pyelonephritis and preterm labour (Williams 2006) (see Chapter 11).</p>
                        <p>Urinalysis is performed at every visit to exclude proteinuria which may be a symptom of pre-eclampsia (NICE 2008) (see Chapter 13). NICE (2008) does not currently recommend routine testing for glycosuria.</p>
                        <h3>Blood tests</h3>
                        <p>The midwife should explain why blood tests are carried out at the booking visit to facilitate informed decision making about the tests that are available. There are many views as to the ethical issues involved in screening. It is important to gain informed consent for any blood tests undertaken (NMC 2008) and offer appropriate counselling before and after the screening is carried out.</p>
                        <p>The midwife should be fully aware of the difference between screening and diagnostic tests, and their accuracy, and discuss these options with women. Blood tests offered at the initial assessment include the following.</p>
                        <h4>ABO blood group and Rhesus (Rh) factor</h4>
                        <p>It is important to identify the blood group, RhD status and red cell antibodies in pregnant women, so haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) can be prevented and preparations made for blood transfusion if it becomes necessary. Blood will be taken at booking and again at 28 weeks to determine if antibodies are present (NICE 2008). All Rh-negative women will be offered two doses of prophylactic anti-D 500 International Units (IU) at 28 and 34 weeks’ gestation or a single dose of 1500 IU at 28-30 weeks’ gestation (NICE 2008). Threatened miscarriage, amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, external cephalic version or any other uterine trauma are indications for the administration of anti-D gammaglobulin within a 72 hours of the event in pregnancy in addition to that given at 28 and 34 weeks (RCOG 2011a). A Kleihauer test should be undertaken to assess how much anti-D is required (RCOG 2011a). If the titration demonstrates a rising antibody response then more frequent assessment will be made in order to plan management by a specialist in Rhesus disease (see Chapter 11).</p>
                        <h4>Full blood count</h4>
                        <p>This is taken to observe the woman’s general blood condition, and includes haemoglobin (Hb) estimations. If the mean cell volume (MCV) is found to be low on the full blood count result, serum ferritin levels are also taken in order to assess the adequacy of iron stores. Iron supplementation is not considered necessary in women who are taking adequate dietary iron and who have a normal Hb and MCV at the initial assessment. There is evidence that supplementing non-anaemic women with iron can increase the risk of hypertension and the small for gestational age birth rate (Ziaei et al 2007). The decision to use supplements should be made on an individual woman’s circumstances and include clear information about dietary iron sources. Maximum absorption of iron in meat or green leafy vegetables will be achieved by consuming vitamin C at the same time and avoiding caffeine. The intestinal mucosa has a limited ability to absorb iron and when this is exceeded extra iron is excreted in the stools.</p>
                        <h3>Other screening tests</h3>
                        <h4>Venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test</h4>
                        <p>This is performed for syphilis. Not all positive results indicate active syphilis; early testing will allow a woman to be treated in order to prevent infection of the fetus (see Chapter 11).</p>
                        <h4>HIV antibodies</h4>
                        <p>Routine screening to detect HIV infection should be offered in pregnancy (NSC 2013) as treatment in pregnancy is beneficial in reducing vertical transmission to the fetus (Chapter 11). Specialist teams should be involved in the subsequent care and management of women with a positive diagnosis.</p>
                        <h4>Rubella immune status</h4>
                        <p>This is determined by measuring the rubella antibody titre (Chapter 11). Women who are not immune must be advised to avoid contact with anyone with the disease. The live vaccination is offered postnatally, and subsequent pregnancy must be avoided for at least 3 months.</p>
                        <h4>Haemoglobinopathies</h4>
                        <p>All women should be offered screening for sickle cell disease or thalassaemias early in pregnancy. Some ethnic groups have a higher incidence than others and the type of screening will depend on the prevalence (NICE 2008). If a woman either has or is a carrier of one of these diseases her partner’s blood should also be tested. The couple will be offered genetic counselling and management during pregnancy will be explained (Chapter 11).</p>
                        <h4>Hepatitis B</h4>
                        <p>Screening is offered in pregnancy so that infected women can be offered postnatal intervention to reduce the risk of mother-to-baby transmission (NICE 2008). Chapter 11 explores this issue in more detail.</p>
                        <h4>Screening for fetal anomaly</h4>
                        <p>The midwife will also explain to the woman the current options regarding fetal anomaly screening and provide her with written information to enable her to make an informed choice. She will inform her about the routine dating and anomaly scans which are part of the screening programme. See Chapter 11 for further details.</p>
                        <h4>Infections NOT routinely screened for in pregnancy</h4>
                        <h5>Hepatitis C</h5>
                        <p>This is currently not recommended as a routine screening test in pregnancy because there is insufficient evidence regarding the prevalence and effectiveness of treatments to reduce transmission to the baby (NSC 2013).</p>
                        <h5>Chlamydia</h5>
                        <p>It is not recommended that all women are routinely screened (NSC 2011), however women under 25 years of age are offered this as part of the National Chlamydia Screening Programme (Public Health England 2013).</p>
                        <h5>Cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis</h5>
                        <p>These are not routinely tested in pregnancy because tests do not currently determine which pregnancies may result in an infected fetus (NICE 2008). Toxoplasmosis screening is not recommended because the risks of screening may outweigh the benefits; however, women need to be informed of how to avoid contracting the infection (NICE 2008).</p>
                        <h5>Group B streptococcus</h5>
                        <p>The NSC (2012b) reviewed this guidance and conclude that screening should not be offered currently but might be a consideration in the future (see Chapter 11).</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">THE MIDWIFE’S EXAMINATION</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The midwife’s general examination of the woman should be holistic and encompass the woman’s physical, social and psychological wellbeing. This antenatal contact gives the midwife an opportunity to look at the woman’s face and assess her health and general wellbeing, including demeanour and signs of fatigue. If at any time the midwife notices any sign of ill health she should discuss this with the woman, and advocate referral to the most appropriate health professional (NMC 2012).</p>
                        <p>The midwife should facilitate discussion about infant feeding throughout pregnancy (UNICEF [United Nations Children’s Fund] 2012). Where breastfeeding peer support is available, introductions should be made so that postnatal support can be more easily accessed. Breastfeeding should be promoted in a sensitive manner, and information given about the benefits to both mother and baby (Chapter 34). Most women will not require an examination of their breasts. Current evidence does not support the benefits of nipple preparation (see Chapter 34). The midwife may also discuss the woman’s experiences of breast changes so far in her pregnancy, and expected changes as pregnancy progresses.</p>
                        <p>Some women will appreciate information about the body changes taking place during pregnancy. Increasing abdominal size may be an acceptable body change but breast changes may not have been anticipated. For most women, breast size and appearance are an important part of their body image. Partners may also be affected by the changes and the midwife can encourage open and honest discussion between the woman and her partner to help to resolve anxieties.</p>
                        <p>Bladder and bowel function may be discussed; dietary advice may be necessary at this visit or later in the pregnancy with reference to how hormonal changes may alter normal bowel and kidney function. Early referral within the multidisciplinary team will be necessary if treatment is required or problems identified. Vaginal discharge (leucorrhoea) increases in pregnancy; the woman may discuss any increase or changes with the midwife. If the discharge is itchy, causes soreness, is any colour other than creamywhite or has an offensive odour then infection is likely, and should be investigated further. Later in pregnancy the woman may report a change from leucorrhoea to a heavier mucous discharge.</p>
                        <p>Early bleeding is not uncommon, however if this is reported the woman can be referred to an Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit for confirmation of pregnancy and advice and appropriate care and follow-up. Ultrasound will usually confirm a diagnosis. The woman may require anti-D immunoglobulin if she is Rhesus-negative within 72 hours (see Chapter 22 for management of antepartum haemorrhage).</p>
                        <p>In the past midwives have palpated the uterus once it has entered the abdomen, from about 12 weeks’ gestation; however, current guidelines suggest that because of sophisticated scanning techniques there is no benefit in palpating the uterus prior to 24 weeks’ gestation, at which time uterine growth can be measured (NICE 2008).</p>
                        <h3>Oedema</h3>
                        <p>This should not be evident during the initial assessment but may occur as the pregnancy progresses. Physiological oedema occurs after rising in the morning and worsens during the day; it is often associated with daily activities or hot weather. At visits later in pregnancy the midwife should observe for oedema and ask the woman about symptoms. Often the woman may notice that her rings feel tighter and her ankles are swollen. Pitting oedema in the lower limbs can be identified by applying gentle fingertip pressure over the tibial bone: a depression will remain when the finger is removed. If oedema reaches the knees, affects the face or is increasing in the fingers it may be indicative of hypertension of pregnancy if other markers are also present.</p>
                        <h3>Varicosities</h3>
                        <p>These are more likely to occur during pregnancy and are a predisposing cause of deep vein thrombosis. The woman should be asked if she has any pain in her legs. Reddened areas on the calf may be due to varicosities, phlebitis or deep vein thrombosis. Areas that appear white as if deprived of blood could be caused by deep vein thrombosis. The woman should be asked to report any tenderness that she feels either during the examination or at any time during the pregnancy. Referral should be made to medical colleagues as appropriate (NMC 2012). Support stockings will help alleviate symptoms although not prevent varicose veins occurring (NICE 2008).</p>
                        <h3>Abdominal examination</h3>
                        <p>Abdominal examination is carried out from 24 weeks’ gestation to establish and affirm that fetal growth is consistent with gestational age during the pregnancy. The specific aims are to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>observe the signs of pregnancy</li>
                            <li>assess fetal size and growth</li>
                            <li>auscultate the fetal heart when indicated</li>
                            <li>locate fetal parts</li>
                            <li>detect any deviation from normal.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Preparation</h4>
                        <p>The woman should be asked to empty her bladder before making herself comfortable on the couch. A full bladder will make the examination uncomfortable; this can also make the measurement of fundal height less accurate. The midwife washes her hands and exposes only that area of the abdomen she needs to palpate, and covers the remainder of the woman to promote privacy and protect her dignity. The woman should be lying comfortably with her arms by her sides to relax the abdominal muscles. The midwife should discuss her findings throughout the abdominal examination with the woman.</p>
                        <h4>Inspection</h4>
                        <p>The uterus is first assessed by observation. A full bladder, distended colon or obesity may give a false impression of fetal size. The shape of the uterus is longer than it is broad when the lie of the fetus is longitudinal, as occurs in the majority of cases. If the lie of the fetus is transverse, the uterus is low and broad.</p>
                        <p>The multiparous uterus may lack the snug ovoid shape of the primigravid uterus. Often it is possible to see the shape of the fetal back or limbs. If the fetus is in an occipitoposterior position a saucer-like depression may be seen at or below the umbilicus. The midwife may observe fetal movements, or the mother may feel them; this can help the midwife determine the position of the fetus. The woman’s umbilicus becomes less dimpled as pregnancy advances and may protrude slightly in later weeks.</p>
                        <p>Lax abdominal muscles in the parous woman may cause the uterus to sag forwards; this is known as pendulous abdomen or anterior obliquity of the uterus. In the primigravida it is a significant sign as it may be due to pelvic contraction.</p>
                        <h4>Skin changes</h4>
                        <p>Stretch marks from previous pregnancies appear silvery and recent ones appear pink. A linea nigra may be seen; this is a normal dark line of pigmentation running longitudinally in the centre of the abdomen below and sometimes above the umbilicus. Scars may indicate previous obstetric or abdominal surgery or self-harm.</p>
                        <h4>Palpation</h4>
                        <p>The midwife’s hands should be clean and warm; cold hands do not have the necessary acute sense of touch, they tend to induce contraction of the abdominal and uterine muscles and the woman may find palpation uncomfortable. Arms and hands should be relaxed and the pads, not the tips, of the fingers used with delicate precision. The hands are moved smoothly over the abdomen to avoid causing contractions.</p>
                        <h5>Measuring fundal height</h5>
                        <p>In order to determine the height of the fundus the midwife places her hand just below the xiphisternum. Pressing gently, she moves her hand down the abdomen until she feels the curved upper border of the fundus (Fig. 10.1).</p>
                        <p>Clinically assessing the uterine size to compare it with gestation does not always produce an accurate result, although there are landmarks that can be used as an approximate guide (see Fig. 10.2). From 25 weeks of pregnancy, the midwife should commence serial symphysis fundal height (SFH) measurements (Fig. 10.3). She uses a tape measure (with the centimetres facing the mother’s abdomen) held at the fundus and extended down to the symphysis pubis, to take a single measurement. This should be recorded in the pregnancy record and plotted on a customized chart rather than a population-based chart (RCOG 2013b).</p>
                        <p>Further investigation is warranted and an ultrasound scan will usually be required alongside appropriate medical referral, if:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a single measurement plots below the 10th centile; or</li>
                            <li>serial measurements show slow growth by crossing centiles (RCOG 2013b).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the uterus is unduly big the fetus maybe large or it may indicate multiple pregnancy or polyhydramnios. When the uterus is smaller than expected the LMP date may be incorrect, or the fetus may be small for gestational age (SGA). Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is associated with stillbirth and expert opinion suggests that early detection and management can reduce the incidence by $20\%$ (Imdad et al 2011).</p>
                        <h5>Fundal palpation</h5>
                        <p>This determines the presence of the breech or the head in the fundus. This information will help to diagnose the lie and presentation of the fetus. Talking through the palpation with the woman, making eye contact with her during the procedure, the midwife lays both hands on the sides of the fundus, fingers held close together and curving round the upper border of the uterus. Gentle yet deliberate pressure is applied using the palmar surfaces of the fingers to determine the soft consistency and indefinite outline that denotes the breech. Sometimes the buttocks feel rather firm but they are not as hard, smooth or well defined as the head. With a gliding movement the fingertips are separated slightly in order to grasp the fetal mass, which may be in the centre or deflected to one side, to assess its size and mobility. The breech cannot be moved independently of the body but the head can (Fig. 10.4). The head is much more distinctive in outline than the breech, being hard and round; it can be balloted (moved from one hand to the other) between the fingertips of the two hands because of the free movement of the neck.</p>
                        <h5>Lateral palpation</h5>
                        <p>This is used to locate the fetal back in order to determine position. The hands are placed on either side of the uterus at the level of the umbilicus (Fig. 10.5). Gentle pressure is applied with alternate hands in order to detect which side of the uterus offers the greater resistance. More detailed information is obtained by feeling along the length of each side with the fingers. This can be done by sliding the hands down the abdomen while feeling the sides of the uterus alternately. Some midwives prefer to steady the uterus with one hand, and using a rotary movement of the opposite hand, to map out the back as a continuous smooth resistant mass from the breech down to the neck; on the other side the same movement reveals the limbs as small parts that slip about under the examining fingers. ‘Walking’ the fingertips of both hands over the abdomen from one side to the other is another method of locating the fetal back (Fig. 10.6).</p>
                        <h5>Pelvic palpation</h5>
                        <p>Pelvic palpation will identify the pole of the fetus in the pelvis; it should not cause discomfort to the woman. NICE (2008) recommend this is done only from 36 weeks onwards.</p>
                        <p>The midwife should ask the woman to bend her knees slightly in order to relax the abdominal muscles and also suggest that she breathe steadily; relaxation may be helped if she sighs out slowly. The sides of the uterus just below umbilical level are grasped snugly between the palms of the hands with the fingers held close together, and pointing downwards and inwards (Fig. 10.7).</p>
                        <p>If the head is presenting (towards the lower part of the uterus), a hard mass with a distinctive round smooth surface will be felt. The midwife should also estimate how much of the fetal head is palpable above the pelvic brim to determine engagement. This two-handed technique appears to be the most comfortable for the woman and gives the most information.</p>
                        <p>Pawlik’s manoeuvre, where the practitioner grasps the lower pole of the uterus between her fingers and thumb, which should be spread wide enough apart to accommodate the fetal head (Fig. 10.8), is sometimes used to judge the size, flexion and mobility of the head, but undue pressure must not be applied. It should be used only if absolutely necessary as it can be very uncomfortable for the woman: There is no research evidence to support one method over the other.</p>
                        <h4>Engagement</h4>
                        <p>Engagement is said to have occurred when the widest presenting transverse diameter of the fetal head has passed through the brim of the pelvis. In cephalic presentations this is the biparietal diameter and in breech presentations the bitrochanteric diameter. In a primigravid woman, the head normally engages at any time from about 36 weeks of pregnancy, but in a multipara this may not occur until after the onset of labour. Engagement of the fetal head is usually measured in fifths palpable above the pelvic brim. When the vertex presents and the head is engaged the following will be evident on clinical examination:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>only two- to three-fifths of the fetal head is palpable above the pelvic brim (Fig. 10.9);</li>
                            <li>the head will not be mobile.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>On rare occasions, the head is not palpable abdominally because it has descended deeply into the pelvis. If the head is not engaged, the findings are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>more than half of the head is palpable above the brim</li>
                            <li>the head may be high and freely movable (ballotable) or partly settled in the pelvic brim and consequently immobile.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In a primigravid woman, it is usual for the head to engage by 37 weeks’ gestation; however this is not always the case. When labour starts, the force of labour contractions encourages flexion and moulding of the fetal head and the relaxed ligaments of the pelvis allow the joints to give. This is usually sufficient to allow engagement and descent. Other causes of a non-engaged head at term include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>occipitoposterior position</li>
                            <li>full bladder</li>
                            <li>wrongly calculated gestational age</li>
                            <li>polyhydramnios</li>
                            <li>placenta praevia or other space-occupying lesion</li>
                            <li>multiple pregnancy</li>
                            <li>pelvic abnormalities</li>
                            <li>fetal abnormality.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Presentation</h4>
                        <p>Presentation refers to the part of the fetus that lies at the pelvic brim or in the lower pole of the uterus. Presentations can be vertex, breech, shoulder, face or brow (Fig. 10.10). Vertex, face and brow are all head or cephalic presentations.</p>

                        <p>When the head is flexed the vertex presents; when it is fully extended the face presents; and when it is partially extended the brow presents (Fig. 10.11). It is more common for the head to present because the bulky breech finds more space in the fundus, which is the widest diameter of the uterus, and the head lies in the narrower lower pole. The muscle tone of the fetus also plays a part in maintaining its flexion and consequently its vertex presentation.</p>
                        <h4>Auscultation</h4>
                        <p>Listening to the fetal heart has historically been an important part of the process. However, NICE (2008) does not recommend routine listening other than at maternal request because there is no clinical benefit. A Pinard’s fetal stethoscope will enable the midwife to hear the fetal heart directly and determine that it is fetal and not maternal. The stethoscope is placed on the mother’s abdomen, at right-angles to it over the fetal back (Fig. 10.12). The ear must be in close, firm contact with the stethoscope but the hand should not touch it while listening because then extraneous sounds are produced. The stethoscope should be moved about until the point of maximum intensity is located where the fetal heart is heard most clearly. The midwife should count the beats per minute, which should be in the range of $110-160$. The midwife should take the woman’s pulse at the same time as listening to the fetal heart to enable her to distinguish between the two. In addition, ultrasound equipment (e.g. a sonicaid or Doppler) can be used for this purpose so that the woman and her partner/children may also hear the fetal heartbeat.</p>
                        <h4>Lie</h4>
                        <p>The lie of the fetus is the relationship between the long axis of the fetus and the long axis of the uterus (Figs 10.13-10.15). In the majority of cases the lie is longitudinal due to the ovoid shape of the uterus; the remainder are oblique or transverse. Oblique lie, when the fetus lies diagonally across the long axis of the uterus, must be distinguished from obliquity of the uterus, when the whole uterus is tilted to one side (usually the right) and the fetus lies longitudinally within it. When the lie is transverse the fetus lies at right angles across the long axis of the uterus. This is often visible on inspection of the abdomen.</p>
                        <h4>Attitude</h4>
                        <p>Attitude is the relationship of the fetal head and limbs to its trunk. The attitude should be one of flexion. The fetus is curled up with chin on chest, arms and legs flexed, forming a snug, compact mass, which utilizes the space in the uterine cavity most effectively. If the fetal head is flexed the smallest diameters will present and, with efficient uterine action, labour will be most effective.</p>
                        <h4>Denominator</h4>
                        <p>‘Denominate’ means ‘to give a name to’; the denominator is the name of the part of the presentation, which is used when referring to fetal position. Each presentation has a different denominator and these are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>in the vertex presentation it is the occiput</li>
                            <li>in the breech presentation it is the sacrum</li>
                            <li>in the face presentation it is the mentum.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Although the shoulder presentation is said to have the acromion process as its denominator, in practice the dorsum is used to describe the position. In the brow presentation no denominator is used.</p>
                        <h4>Position</h4>
                        <p>The position is the relationship between the denominator of the presentation and six points on the pelvic brim (Fig. 10.16). In addition, the denominator may be found in the midline either anteriorly or posteriorly, especially late in labour. This position is often transient and is described as direct anterior or direct posterior.</p>
                        <p>Anterior positions are more favourable than posterior positions because when the fetal back is at the front of the uterus it conforms to the concavity of the mother’s abdominal wall and the fetus can flex more easily. When the back is flexed the head also tends to flex and a smaller diameter presents to the pelvic brim. There is also more room in the anterior part of the pelvic brim for the broad biparietal diameter of the head. The positions in a vertex presentation are summarized in Box 10.6 and shown in Fig. 10.17.</p>
                        <h4>Findings</h4>
                        <p>The findings from the abdominal palpation should be considered part of the holistic assessment of the pregnant woman’s health and fetal wellbeing. The midwife collates all the information she has gathered from inspection, palpation and auscultation and relays this to the woman. Deviation from the expected growth and development should be discussed with the woman and referral to an obstetrician or appropriate professional arranged and documented as appropriate (NMC 2012).</p>

                        <p>The woman’s general health and wellbeing is observed throughout and the midwife must remain vigilant for signs of domestic abuse, emotional fragility and social instability. Endeavouring to maintain continuity of carer will be a key process for identifying impending problems and for encouraging free exchange of information between the woman and her midwife. There should be clear referral pathways for the midwife to follow when she has cause for concern regarding a woman’s obstetric, social or emotional wellbeing.</p>
                        <p>Surveillance for symptoms of pre-eclampsia is ongoing throughout pregnancy. It has been recommended by NICE (2008: para 1.9.2.5) that if there is a ‘single diastolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg or two consecutive readings of 90 mmHg at least 4 hours apart and/or significant proteinuria ( $1+$ )’, there should be an increase in surveillance (see Chapter 13).</p>
                        <h3>Indicators of fetal wellbeing</h3>
                        <p>These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>increasing uterine size compatible with the gestational age of the fetus;</li>
                            <li>fetal movements that follow a regular pattern from the time when they are first felt;</li>
                            <li>fetal heart rate that is regular and variable with a rate between 110 and 160 beats/minute.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Eliciting information about recent fetal movements reminds the woman of the importance of noticing this feedback from her baby. Women should be reminded that there should be no reduction in fetal movements in the last trimester (RCOG 2011b) and to contact their midwife if they notice a reduction. Recurrent reduction in fetal movements is associated with a poor fetal outcome (O’Sullivan et al 2009). However, NICE (2008), and subsequently supported by Imdad et al (2011), does not recommend routine fetal movement counting as there is insufficient evidence that it improves fetal wellbeing.</p>
                        <h3>Preparation for labour</h3>
                        <h4>Perineal massage</h4>
                        <p>Women should be informed that there is evidence that perineal massage from 35 weeks of pregnancy is effective in reducing the likelihood of perineal damage during the birth (Beckmann and Garrett 2006) (and see Chapter 15). This can be undertaken by the woman or her partner just once or twice a week with a significant positive impact on her perineal integrity and postnatal pain (Chapter 23).</p>
                        <h4>Stretch and sweep</h4>
                        <p>NICE guidelines (2008) recommend that the midwife offers a membrane sweep to women who have not given birth by 41 weeks. More recently, the Antenatal Quality Standard (NICE 2012) recommends at 40 and 41 weeks for a primigravida (see Box 10.2). This procedure has been shown to reduce the number of women who require induction of labour, and although this can be uncomfortable it is a safe and simple technique (Boulvain et al 2005) (see Chapter 19).</p>
                        <h4>Birth plans</h4>
                        <p>During the latter weeks of pregnancy, expectations and plans for labour and birth will be a focus of discussion. Women should know when they should contact a midwife and how to do so. If the woman has planned a home birth, she will be visited by her midwife to make final preparations. Most maternity units provide a list of items that women will need to bring with them if they are planning to birth away from home. In all situations it is important to ensure that women know how to get advice if they have any concerns.</p>
                        <p>A birth plan can be instrumental in assisting the woman towards having the birth experience of her choice and to consider what she might like to do during labour and what is important to her. Lundgren et al (2003) suggest that birth plans do not enhance the childbirth experience for all but some women felt that aspects of pain, fear and concern for their baby were alleviated by having a birth plan. Birth plans are likely to be most effective if they are written with the midwife sharing information to enable the woman to make plans that are informed by what is available locally and what is considered current best practice and care.</p>
                        <p>Flexibility and adaptability should be built into the labour and birth plans to ensure an individual approach is adopted and the woman’s wishes are carefully considered. Parents’ wishes should be revisited when labour commences and discussions recorded in the labour notes. Each woman should be aware that it may be necessary to adapt her plans depending on the circumstances at the time, but be reassured that she will be fully involved in all decisions made.</p>
                        <h3>Home visit and safe sleeping advice</h3>
                        <p>It is practice in many units to undertake one of the antenatal visits at the woman’s home, in order to discuss arrangements for caring for the baby when it is born. This may include seeing where the baby will sleep and advising on safe sleeping principles (see Chapter 34). It provides another opportunity to discuss keeping a smoke-free home and ensuring that the woman knows how and when to make contact when labour starts.</p>
