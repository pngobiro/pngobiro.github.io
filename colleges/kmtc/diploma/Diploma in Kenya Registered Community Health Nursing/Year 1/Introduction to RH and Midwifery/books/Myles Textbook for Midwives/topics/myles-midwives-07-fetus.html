In addition, discussion of the fetal skull and the significance of its diameters in late pregnancy and during labour in influencing an optimum birth outcome is provided.</p>
                        <p>An understanding of the detail is of value to the midwife when providing parents with information about the effects of maternal lifestyle, such as diet, smoking, alcohol intake, drug use and exercise, on fetal growth and development (see Chapter 8) and when a baby is born before term (see Chapter 30).</p>

                        <p>Embryological development is complex and occurs from the 2nd to the 8th week of pregnancy and includes the development of the zygote in the first 2-3 weeks following fertilization. Fetal development occurs from the 8th week until birth. The interval from the beginning of the last menstrual period (LMP) until fertilization is not part of pregnancy, however this period is important for the calculation of the expected date of birth. Figure 7.1 illustrates the comparative lengths of these prenatal events.</p>
                        <p>A summary of embryological and fetal development categorized into 4-week periods is provided in Box 7.1. This should be used to complement the text below.</p>

                        <p>From the 9th week of pregnancy, fetal growth is rapid. Tissues grow by cell proliferation, cell enlargement and accretion of extracellular material. An adequate supply of nutrients and oxygen from the placenta to the fetus is crucial for growth. In developed countries the average birth weight is around 3400 g of which $50\%$ is acquired by 30 weeks’ gestation. The fetus gains approximately $25 \mathrm{~g} /$ day between weeks 32 and 40. A visual representation of growth in terms of height is provided in Fig. 7.2.</p>
                        <p>As fetal growth is an indicator of fetal health and wellbeing, monitoring of growth is crucial. This is done by visual observation of the uterus for size, symphysis fundal height measurements and ultrasonography.</p>

                        <h3>The cardiovascular system</h3>
                        <p>The early development of the cardiovascular system in the 3rd week of pregnancy coincides with the lack of the yolk sac, and the urgent need to supply the growing embryo with oxygen and nutrients from the maternal blood through the placenta.</p>
                        <p>The cardiovascular system is the first system to function in the embryo. The heart and vascular system commences development in the 3rd week, and by the 4th week a primitive heart is visible and is beginning to function, beating at around 22 days (Schoenwolf et al 2009). Vascular endothelial growth factor is a protein that causes vasculogenesis and subsequent angiogenesis to occur. Initially a vascular plexus is formed in the embryo, which is continually remodeled into a system of arteries and veins to accommodate the growing and developing embryo.</p>
                        <p>The first signs of the heart are the appearance of paired endothelial strands in the cardiogenic mesoderm, which canalize to become heart tubes and then fuse to become a tubular-shaped heart. The development continues to include remodeling and septation while the heart continues to beat. Blood is pumped around the vessels from the 4th week, by which time three major vascular systems have developed.</p>
                        <h4>Arteries</h4>
                        <p><strong>Vitelline arteries</strong> link the aorta with the yolk sac which subsequently supplies the gut and other arteries in the neck and thorax. Mid gestation they are remodelled to form three main arteries which supply the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
                        <p>Two <strong>umbilical arteries</strong> deliver deoxygenated blood to the placenta.</p>
                        <h4>Veins</h4>
                        <p>The embryo has three major venous systems draining into the tubular-shaped heart: vitelline, umbilical and cardinal (Schoenwolf et al 2009).</p>
                        <p>The <strong>vitelline veins</strong> return poorly oxygenated blood from the gut and yolk sac. The hepatic veins and the portal vein develop from the vitelline veins and their networks. A temporary shunt, the ductus venosus, also develops from these veins.</p>
                        <p><strong>Umbilical veins</strong> form in the body stalk. The right umbilical vein anastomoses with the ductus venosus shunting oxygenated placental blood into the inferior vena cava leaving the left umbilical vein to continue carrying oxygenated blood from the placenta to the embryo. Between 5-7 weeks of pregnancy, the foramen ovale is formed. From here on there is shunting of highly oxygenated blood from the right to left atrium, bypassing the right ventricle and pulmonary system, allowing the higher oxygenated blood to be pumped immediately to the brain and upper body.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>cardinal veins</strong> drain the head, neck and body wall into the heart.</p>
                        <p>Development over time ensures that the three systems develop into the adult pattern whilst maintaining some temporary structures in the fetus which resolve at, or soon after, birth.</p>
                        <p>There are three phases of red blood cell formation:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the yolk sac period, between weeks 3 and 13;</li>
                            <li>the hepatic/liver period, between weeks 5 and 36 (Stables and Rankin 2010); and</li>
                            <li>the bone marrow period, from the 10 th week throughout life (Schoenwolf et al 2009).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Red blood cells, known as erythrocytes, which are produced from ‘blood islands’ in the extra embryonic mesoderm lining the yolk sac and liver, contain fetal haemoglobin. Fetal haemoglobin (HbF) has a much greater affinity for oxygen and is found in greater concentrations (18-20 g/dl at term) in the blood than adult haemoglobin (HbA), thus enhancing the transfer of oxygen across the placental site. Fetal erythrocytes have a life span of 90 days, shorter than adult erythrocytes, which is around 120 days. The short life span of fetal erythrocytes contributes to neonatal physiological jaundice (see Chapter 33). Genes passed from both parents determine the fetal blood group and Rhesus factor.</p>
                        <h3>The respiratory system</h3>
                        <p>The development of the respiratory system begins in the 3rd week. The lower respiratory tract and lungs develop simultaneously. The lungs originate from a ‘lung bud’ growing out of the foregut, which repeatedly subdivides to form the branching structure of the bronchial tree. By 36 weeks of pregnancy, respiratory bronchioles have a capillary network and culminate in terminal sacs (alveoli). Lung development occurs on several levels and continues after birth until about 8 years of age when the full number of bronchioles and alveoli will have developed. The development of type II alveolar cells commences around 20 weeks of fetal life. These cells are necessary for the production of surfactant, a lipoprotein that reduces the surface tension in the alveoli and assists gaseous exchange. The amount of surfactant increases until the alveoli mature between 36 weeks and birth.</p>
                        <p>There is some movement of the thorax from the 12th week of fetal life and more definite diaphragmatic movements from the 24th week. This does not constitute breathing as gaseous exchange is via the placenta.</p>
                        <p>At term, the lungs contain about 100 ml of lung fluid. About one-third of this is expelled during birth and the rest is absorbed and transported by the lymphatics and blood vessels as air takes its place.</p>
                        <p>Babies born before 24 weeks of pregnancy have a reduced chance of survival owing to the immaturity of the capillary system in the lungs and the lack of surfactant (see Chapter 33).</p>
                        <h3>The urogenital system</h3>
                        <p>The urogenital system is divided functionally into the urinary/renal system and the genital/reproductive system. Both systems develop from the intermediate mesoderm. The kidneys develop from the 4th week of fetal life and produce small amounts of urine between the 6th and 10th week. They become more functional around the 15th week when more urine is produced. The urine does not constitute a route for excretion as elimination of waste products is via the placenta. The urine forms much of the amniotic fluid and production increases with fetal maturity.</p>
                        <p>The superior vesical arteries arise from the first few centimetres of the hypogastric arteries, which lead to the umbilical arteries. A single umbilical artery at birth is suggestive of malformations of the renal tract (see Chapter 32).</p>
                        <p>The sex of the embryo is determined at fertilization: either two X chromosomes (in the female) or one X and one Y chromosome (in the male) are inherited. The gonads develop from the 5th week from the intermediate mesoderm. In the two sexes, genital development is similar and is referred to as the indifferent state of sexual development. A single sex determining protein on the gene of the Y chromosome (SRY) controls the subsequent male development pattern (Schoenwolf et al 2009). Differentiation occurs from the 7th week, but female gonad development occurs slowly under the influence of pro-ovarian genes and the ovaries may not be identifiable until the 10th week. The external genitalia in both sexes develop in the 9th week, but males and females are not distinguishable until about the 12th week.</p>
                        <h3>The endocrine system</h3>
                        <p>The adrenal glands develop from mesoderm and neural crest cells from the 6th week of fetal life, and grow to 10-20 times larger than the adult adrenals. Their size regresses during the first year of life. They produce the precursors for placental formation of oestriols and influence maturation of the lungs, liver and epithelium of the digestive tract. It is also thought that the adrenal glands play a part in the initiation of labour, but the exact mechanism is not fully understood (Johnson and Everitt 2000).</p>
                        <p>The pituitary gland develops and takes on its characteristic shape from between the 9th and 17th week of fetal life. The fetal pituitary produces gonadotrophins, i.e. luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from weeks 13-14, and human growth hormone (hGH) is present by weeks 19-20.</p>
                        <h3>The digestive system</h3>
                        <p>The primitive gut develops from the endodermal layer of the yolk sac in the 4th week of fetal life. It begins as a straight tube, and proceeds on several levels: foregut, midgut and hindgut.</p>
                        <p>By the 5th week, the foregut (oesophagus, stomach and duodenum) is visible. The liver, gallbladder and pancreas bud form the gut tube around the 4th to 5th week of fetal life. The liver grows rapidly from the 5th week and by the 10th week occupies much of the abdominal cavity, constituting about $10\%$ of the fetal weight by the 9th week. Towards the end of pregnancy, iron stores are laid down in the liver and the liver cells produce bile from the 12th week.</p>
                        <p>The midgut (small intestine, caecum and vermiform appendix, ascending colon and transverse colon) undertakes much of its development in the 6th week, while the hindgut (rectum and anal canal) completes its development in the 7th week of fetal life.</p>
                        <p>Around 12 weeks, the digestive tract is well formed and the lumen is patent. Most digestive juices are present before birth and act on the swallowed substances to form meconium. Bile enters the duodenum from the bile duct during the 13th week, giving the intestinal contents a dark green colour. Meconium is normally retained in the gut until after birth when it is passed as the first stool of the baby.</p>
                        <p>Insulin is secreted from 10 weeks of fetal life and glucagon from 15 weeks, both of which rise steadily with increasing fetal age.</p>
                        <h3>The nervous system</h3>
                        <p>The brain begins to develop from around day 19 and three structures are visible: forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. By the 5th week, there is differentiation between the major regions, namely the thalamus and the hypothalamus.</p>
                        <p>The neural tube is derived from the ectoderm which folds inwards by a complicated process to form the neural tube, which is then covered over by skin. Closure of the neural tube is essential and takes place by 26 days. This process is occasionally incomplete, leading to open neural tube defects (see Chapter 32).</p>
                        <p>The development of the sense organs, including the transmission of sensory input to the brain and output from the brain, occurs under complex processes. The eyes and ears are associated with the development of the head and neck, which begin early and continue until the cessation of growth in the late teens. Although the eyes develop from around 22 days, for normal vision to occur many complex structures within the eye must properly relate to neighbouring structures. The eye is completely formed by 20 weeks but the eyelids are fused until around 24 weeks. The developing eyes are sensitive to light.</p>
                        <p>The development of the inner ear, which contains the structures for hearing and balance, commences early in embryological life but is not complete until around 25 weeks.</p>
                        <p>Motor output controlled by the basal ganglia in the form of movement, begins around 8 weeks, however these movements are not usually felt by the mother until around 16 weeks, and are referred to as quickening. As the nervous system matures fetal behaviour becomes more complex and more defined. The fetus develops behavioural patterns: sleep with no eye or body movements; sleep with periodic eye and body movements, known as REM sleep; wakefulness with subtle eye and limb movements; active phase with vigorous eye and limb movements.</p>
                        <h3>Integumentary, skeletal and muscular systems</h3>
                        <p>The epidermis develops from a single layer of ectoderm to which other layers are added. By the end of 4 weeks, a thin outer layer of flattened cells covers the embryo. Further development continues until 24 weeks. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) develops from 18 weeks’ gestation; this plays an important part in thermoregulation after birth. From 18 weeks, the fetus is covered with a white, creamy substance called vernix caseosa, which protects the skin from the amniotic fluid and from any friction against itself. Hair begins to develop between the 9th and 12th week. By 20 weeks the fetus is covered with a fine downy hair called lanugo; at the same time the hair on the head and eyebrows begin to form. Lanugo is shed from 36 weeks and by term, there is little left. Fingernails develop from about 10 weeks but the toenails do not form until about 18 weeks. By term the nails usually extend beyond the fingertips and so it is not unusual to see scratches on the baby’s face.</p>
                        <p>Most skeletal tissue arises from the mesodermal and neural crest cells but skeletal tissue in different parts of the body are diverse in morphology and tissue architecture. The skull develops during the 4th week from the mesenchyme surrounding the developing brain. It consists of two major parts: the neurocranium, which forms the bones of the skull, and the viscerocranium, which forms the bones of the face (Tortora and Derrickson 2011). The neurocranium forms flat bones at the roof and sides of the skull. Ossification here is intramembranous and the membranous separations between the flat bones are known as sutures and fontanelles. The functions of these will be discussed later in the chapter.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The placenta is the source of oxygenation, nutrition and elimination of waste for the fetus. There are several temporary structures in addition to the placenta and the umbilical cord that enable the fetal circulation to occur (Fig. 7.3). These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The <strong>ductus venosus</strong>, which connects the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>foramen ovale</strong>, which is an opening between the right and left atria.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>ductus arteriosus</strong>, which leads from the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery to the descending aorta.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>hypogastric arteries</strong>, which branch off from the internal iliac arteries and become the umbilical arteries when they enter the umbilical cord.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The fetal circulation takes the following course:</p>
                        <p>Oxygenated blood from the placenta travels to the fetus in the umbilical vein. The umbilical vein divides into two branches - one that supplies the portal vein in the liver, the other anastomosing with the ductus venosus and joining the inferior vena cava. Most of the oxygenated blood that enters the right atrium passes across the foramen ovale to the left atrium, which mixes with a very small amount of blood returning from the lungs from where it passes into the left ventricle via the bicuspid valve, and then the aorta. The head and upper extremities receive approximately $50\%$ of this blood via the coronary and carotid arteries, and the subclavian arteries respectively. The rest of the blood travels down the descending aorta, mixing with deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle via the ductus arteriosus.</p>
                        <p>Deoxygenated blood collected from the head and upper parts of the body returns to the right atrium via the superior vena cava. Blood that has entered the right atrium from the superior vena cava enters at a different angle to the blood that enters from the inferior vena cava and heads towards the foramen ovale. Hence there are two distinct blood flows entering the right atrium. Most of the lesser oxygenated blood entering the right atrium from the superior vena cava passes behind the flow of highly oxygenated blood going to the left atrium and enters the right ventricle via the tricuspid valve. There is a small amount of blood mixing where the two blood flows meet in the atrium. From the right ventricle a little blood travels to the lungs in the pulmonary artery, for their development. Most blood, however, passes from the pulmonary artery through the ductus arteriosus into the descending aorta. This blood, although low in oxygen and nutrients, is sufficient to supply the lower body of the fetus. It is also by this means that deoxygenated blood travels back to the placenta via the internal iliac arteries, which lead into the hypogastric arteries, and ultimately into the umbilical arteries. This circulation means that the fetus has a welloxygenated and perfused head, brain and upper body compared to its lower extremities.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>At birth, there is a dramatic alteration to the fetal circulation and an almost immediate change occurs. The cessation of umbilical blood flow causes a cessation of flow in the ductus venosus and a fall in pressure in the right atrium. As the baby takes its first breath, blood is drawn along the pulmonary system via the pulmonary artery and as a consequence, pressure increases in the left atrium due to the increased blood supply returning to it via the pulmonary veins. The alteration of pressures between the two atria causes a mechanical closure of the foramen ovale. In addition, as the baby takes its first breath, the lungs inflate, and there is a rapid fall in pulmonary vascular resistance of approximately $80\%$, a slight reverse flow of oxygenated aortic blood along the ductus arteriosus and a rise in the oxygen tension. This causes the smooth muscle in the walls of the ductus arteriosus to contract and constrict, usually within 24 hours following birth, though it can remain patent for a few days.</p>
                        <p>As these structural changes become permanent, the following fetal structures arise:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The umbilical vein becomes the ligamentum teres.</li>
                            <li>The ductus venosus becomes the ligamentum venosum.</li>
                            <li>The ductus arteriosus becomes the ligamentum arteriosum.</li>
                            <li>The foramen ovale becomes the fossa ovalis.</li>
                            <li>The hypogastric arteries become the obliterated hypogastric arteries except for the first few centimetres, which remain open and are known as the superior vesical arteries.</li>

                        <p>The <strong>vault</strong> is the large, dome-shaped part above an imaginary line drawn between the orbital ridges and the nape of the neck.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>base</strong> comprises bones that are firmly united to protect the vital centres in the medulla oblongata.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>face</strong> is composed of 14 small bones that are also firmly united and non-compressible.</p>
                        <h4>The bones of the vault</h4>
                        <p>The bones of the vault (Fig. 7.8) are laid down in membrane. They harden from the centre outwards in a process known as ossification. Ossification is incomplete at birth, leaving small gaps between the bones, known as the sutures and fontanelles. The ossification centre on each bone appears as a protuberance. Ossification of the skull is not complete until early adulthood.</p>
                        <p>The bones of the vault consist of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The <strong>occipital bone</strong>, which lies at the back of the head. Part of it contributes to the base of the skull as it contains the foramen magnum, which protects the spinal cord as it leaves the skull. The ossification centre is the occipital protuberance.</li>
                            <li>The two <strong>parietal bones</strong>, which lie on either side of the skull. The ossification centre of each of these bones is called the parietal eminence.</li>
                            <li>The two <strong>frontal bones</strong>, which form the forehead or sinciput. The ossification centre of each bone is the frontal eminence. The frontal bones fuse into a single bone by eight years of age.</li>
                            <li>The upper part of the <strong>temporal bone</strong> on both sides of the head forms part of the vault.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Sutures and fontanelles</h4>
                        <p>The sutures are the cranial joints formed where two bones meet. Where two or more sutures meet, a fontanelle is formed (see Fig. 7.8). The sutures and fontanelles described below permit a degree of overlapping of the skull bones during labour, which is known as moulding.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The <strong>lambdoidal suture</strong> separates the occipital bone from the two parietal bones.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>sagittal suture</strong> lies between the two parietal bones.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>coronal suture</strong> separates the frontal bones from the parietal bones, passing from one temple to the other.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>

                            <li>The <strong>frontal suture</strong> runs between the two halves of the frontal bone. Whereas the frontal suture becomes obliterated in time, the other sutures eventually become fixed joints.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>posterior fontanelle or lambda</strong> (shaped like the Greek letter lambda λ) is situated at the junction of the lambdoidal and sagittal sutures. It is small, triangular in shape and can be recognized vaginally because a suture leaves from each of the three angles. It normally closes by 6 weeks of age.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>anterior fontanelle or bregma</strong> is found at the junction of the sagittal, coronal and frontal sutures. It is broad, kite-shaped and recognizable vaginally because a suture leaves from each of the four corners. It measures $3-4 \mathrm{~cm}$ long and $1.5-2 \mathrm{~cm}$ wide and normally closes by 18 months of age. Pulsations of cerebral vessels can be felt through this fontanelle.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Regions and landmarks of the fetal skull</h4>
                        <p>The skull is further separated into regions, and within these there are important landmarks as shown in Fig. 7.9. These landmarks are useful to the midwife when undertaking a vaginal examination as they help ascertain the position of the fetal head.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The <strong>occiput</strong> region lies between the foramen magnum and the posterior fontanelle. The part below the occipital protuberance (landmark) is known as the <strong>sub-occipital region</strong>.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>vertex</strong> region is bounded by the posterior fontanelle, the two parietal eminences and the anterior fontanelle.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>forehead/sinciput</strong> region extends from the anterior fontanelle and the coronal suture to the orbital ridges.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>face</strong> extends from the orbital ridges and the root of the nose to the junction of the chin or mentum (landmark) and the neck. The point between the eyebrows is known as the <strong>glabella</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Diameters of the fetal skull</h3>
                        <p>Knowledge of the diameters of the skull alongside the diameters of the pelvis allows the midwife to determine the relationship between the fetal head and the mother’s pelvis. There are six longitudinal diameters (Fig. 7.10). The longitudinal diameters are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The <strong>sub-occipitobregmatic (SOB) diameter</strong> (9.5 cm) measured from below the occipital protuberance to the centre of the anterior fontanelle or bregma.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>sub-occipitofrontal (SOF) diameter</strong> (10 cm) measured from below the occipital protuberance to the centre of the frontal suture.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>occipitofrontal (OF) diameter</strong> (11.5 cm) measured from the occipital protuberance to the glabella.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>mentovertical (MV) diameter</strong> (13.5 cm) measured from the point of the chin to the highest point on the vertex.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>sub-mentovertical (SMV) diameter</strong> (11.5 cm) measured from the point where the chin joins the neck to the highest point on the vertex</li>
                            <li>The <strong>sub-mentobregmatic (SMB) diameter</strong> (9.5 cm) measured from the point where the chin joins the neck to the centre of the bregma (anterior fontanelle).</li>

                        <p>There are also two transverse diameters, as shown in Fig. 7.11.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The <strong>biparietal diameter</strong> (9.5 cm) - the diameter between the two parietal eminences.</li>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 7.2 Diameters of the fetal trunk</h4>
                            <h5>Bisacromial diameter 12 cm</h5>
                            <p>This is the distance between the acromion processes on the two shoulder blades and is the dimension that needs to pass through the maternal pelvis for the shoulders to be born. The articulation of the clavicles on the sternum allows forward movement of the shoulders, which may reduce the diameter slightly.</p>
                            <h5>Bitrochanteric diameter 10 cm</h5>
                            <p>This is measured between the greater trochanters of the femurs and is the presenting diameter in breech presentation.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h4>Presenting diameters</h4>
                        <p>Some presenting diameters are more favourable than others for easy passage through the maternal pelvis and this will depend on the attitude of the fetal head. This term attitude is used to describe the degree of flexion or extension of the fetal head on the neck. The attitude of the head determines which diameters will present in labour and therefore influences the outcome.</p>
                        <p>The presenting diameters of the head are those that are at right-angles to the curve of Carus of the maternal pelvis. There are always two: a longitudinal diameter and a transverse diameter. The presenting diameters determine the presentation of the fetal head, for which there are three:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Vertex presentation.</strong> When the head is well flexed the sub-occipitobregmatic diameter (9.5 cm) and the biparietal diameter (9.5 cm) present (Fig. 7.12). As these two diameters are the same length the presenting area is circular, which is the most favourable shape for dilating the cervix and birth of the head. The diameter that distends the vaginal orifice is the sub-occipitofrontal diameter (10 cm). When the head is deflexed, the presenting diameters are the occipitofrontal (11.5 cm) and the biparietal (9.5 cm). This situation often arises when the occiput is in a posterior position. If it remains so, the diameter distending the vaginal orifice will be the occipitofrontal (11.5 cm).</li>
                            <li><strong>Face presentation.</strong> When the head is completely extended the presenting diameters are the submentobregmatic (9.5 cm) and the bitemporal (8.2 cm). The sub-mentovertical diameter (11.5 cm) will distend the vaginal orifice.</li>
                            <li><strong>Brow presentation.</strong> When the head is partially extended, the mentovertical diameter (13.5 cm) and the bitemporal diameter (8.2 cm) present. If this presentation persists, vaginal birth is unlikely.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The term moulding is used to describe the change in shape of the fetal head that takes place during its passage through the birth canal. Alteration in shape is possible because the bones of the vault allow a slight degree of bending and the skull bones are able to override at the sutures. This overriding allows a considerable reduction in the size of the presenting diameters, while the diameter at right-angles to them is able to lengthen owing to the give of the skull bones (Fig. 7.13). The shortening of the fetal head diameters may be by as much as 1.25 cm . The dotted lines in Figs 7.14-7.19 illustrate moulding in the various presentations.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, moulding is a protective mechanism and prevents the fetal brain from being compressed as long as it is not excessive, too rapid or in an unfavourable direction. The skull of the pre-term infant is softer and has wider sutures than that of the term baby, and hence may mould excessively should labour occur prior to term.</p>

                        <p>Embryonic and fetal development occurs alongside placental development. There is constant growth and remodelling of cells, tissues, organs and systems prior to birth. Several temporary structures in the fetus support systems in utero; these consequently become redundant at birth and they either disappear or become ligaments. At birth all organs are functioning but some may be immature and continue to develop as part of extrauterine life.</p>
