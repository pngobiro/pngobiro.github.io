                        <p>Problems of pregnancy range from the mildly irritating to life-threatening conditions. Fortunately in the developed world, the life-threatening ones are rare because of improvements in the general health of the population, improved social circumstances and lower parity. However, as women delay childbearing, they become more at risk of disorders associated with increasing age, such as miscarriage and placenta praevia.</p>
                        <p>Regular antenatal examinations beginning early in pregnancy are undoubtedly valuable. They help to prevent many complications and their ensuing problems, contribute to timely diagnosis and treatment, and enable women to form relationships with midwives, obstetricians and other health professionals who become involved with them in striving to achieve the best possible pregnancy outcomes.</p>

                        <p>The midwife’s role in relation to the problems associated with pregnancy is clear. At initial and subsequent encounters with the pregnant woman, it is essential that an accurate health history is obtained. General and specific physical examinations must be carried out and the results meticulously recorded. The examination and recordings enable effective referral and management. Where the midwife detects a deviation from the norm which is outside her sphere of practice, she must refer the woman to a suitable qualified health professional to assist her (NMC [Nursing and Midwifery Council] 2012a). The midwife will continue to offer the woman care and support throughout her pregnancy and beyond. The woman who develops problems during her pregnancy is no less in need of the midwife’s skilled attention; indeed, her condition and psychological state may be considerably improved by the midwife’s continued presence and support. It is also the midwife’s role in such a situation to ensure that the woman and her family understand the situation; are enabled to take part in decision-making; and are protected from unnecessary fear. As the primary care manager, the midwife must ensure that all the attention the woman receives from different health professionals is balanced and integrated - in short, the woman’s needs remain paramount throughout.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Abdominal pain is a common complaint in pregnancy. It is probably suffered by all women at some stage, and therefore presents a problem for the midwife of how to distinguish between the physiologically normal (e.g. mild indigestion or muscle stretching), the pathological but not dangerous (e.g. degeneration of a fibroid) and the dangerously pathological requiring immediate referral to the appropriate medical practitioner for urgent treatment (e.g. ectopic pregnancy or appendicitis).</p>
                        <p>The midwife should take a detailed history and perform a physical examination in order to reach a decision about whether to refer the woman. Treatment will depend on the cause (see Box 12.1) and the maternal and fetal conditions.</p>
                        <p>Many of the pregnancy-specific causes of abdominal pain in pregnancy listed in Box 12.1 are dealt with in this and other chapters. For most of these conditions, abdominal pain is one of many symptoms and not necessarily the overriding one. However, an observant midwife’s skills may be crucial in procuring a safe pregnancy outcome for a woman presenting with abdominal pain.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Any vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy is abnormal and of concern to the woman and her partner, especially if there is a history of previous pregnancy loss. The midwife can come into contact with women at this time either through the booking clinic or through phone contact. If bleeding in early pregnancy occurs a woman may contact the midwife, the birthing unit or a triage line for advice and support. The midwife should be aware of the local policies pertaining to her employment and how to guide the woman. In some areas of the United Kingdom (UK) women are reviewed within the maternity department from early pregnancy, whereas in others, they will be seen by the gynaecology team until 20 weeks’ gestation, possibly in an early pregnancy clinic. However, women are often advised to contact their General Practitioner (GP) in the first instance, and many will visit an accident and emergency department.</p>
                        <p>In all cases, a history should be obtained to establish the amount and colour of the bleeding, when it occurred and whether there was any associated pain. Fetal wellbeing may be assessed either by ultrasound scan or, in the second trimester, using a hand-held Doppler device to hear the fetal heart sounds. Maternal reporting of fetal movements may also be useful in determining the viability of a pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>There are many causes of vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy, some of which can occasionally lead to lifethreatening situations and others of less consequence for the continuance of pregnancy. The midwife should be aware of the different causes of vaginal bleeding in order to advise and support the woman and her family accordingly.</p>
                        <h3>Implantation bleed</h3>
                        <p>A small vaginal bleed can occur when the blastocyst embeds in the endometrium. This usually occurs 5-7 days after fertilization, and if the timing coincides with the expected menstruation this may cause confusion over the dating of the pregnancy if the menstrual cycle is used to estimate the date of birth.</p>
                        <h3>Cervical ectropion</h3>
                        <p>More commonly known as cervical erosion. The changes seen in cases of cervical ectropion are as a physical response to hormonal changes that occur in pregnancy. The number of columnar epithelial cells in the cervical canal increase significantly under the influence of oestrogen during pregnancy to such an extent that they extend beyond to the vaginal surface of the cervical os, giving it a dark red appearance. As this area is vascular, and the cells form only a single layer, bleeding may occur either spontaneously or following sexual intercourse. Normally, no treatment is required, and the ectropion reverts back to normal cervical cells during the puerperium.</p>
                        <h3>Cervical polyps</h3>
                        <p>These are small, vascular, pedunculated growths on the cervix, which consist of squamous or columnar epithelial cells over a core of connective tissue rich with blood vessels. During pregnancy, the polyps may be a cause of bleeding, but require no treatment unless the bleeding is severe or a smear test indicates malignancy.</p>
                        <h3>Carcinoma of the cervix</h3>
                        <p>Carcinoma of the cervix is the most common gynaecological malignant disease occurring in pregnancy with an estimated incidence of 1 in 2200 pregnancies (Copeland and Landon 2011). The condition presents with vaginal bleeding and increased vaginal discharge. On speculum examination the appearance of the cervix may lead to a suspicion of carcinoma, which is diagnosed following colposcopy or a cervical biopsy.</p>
                        <p>The precursor to cervical cancer is cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which can be diagnosed from an abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) smear. Where this is diagnosed at an early stage, treatment can usually be postponed for the duration of the pregnancy. The Pap smear is not routinely carried out during pregnancy, but the midwife should ensure that pregnant women know about the National Health Service Cervical Screening Programme (2013), recommending a smear 6 weeks postnatally if one has not been carried out in the previous 3 years.</p>
                        <p>Treatment for cervical carcinoma in pregnancy will depend on the gestation of the pregnancy and the stage of the disease, and full explanations of treatments and their possible outcomes should be given to the woman and her family. For carcinoma in the early stages, treatment may be delayed until the end of the pregnancy, or a cone biopsy may be performed under general anaesthetic to remove the affected tissue. However, there is a risk of haemorrhage due to the increased vascularity of the cervix in pregnancy, as well as a risk of miscarriage. Where the disease is more advanced, and the diagnosis made in early pregnancy, the woman may be offered a termination of pregnancy in order to receive treatment, as the effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy on the fetus cannot be accurately predicted at the present time. During the late second and third trimester the obstetric and oncology teams will consider the optimal time for birth in order to achieve the best outcomes for both mother and baby.</p>
                        <h3>Spontaneous miscarriage</h3>
                        <p>The term miscarriage is used to describe a spontaneous pregnancy loss in preference to the term of abortion which is associated with the deliberate ending of a pregnancy. A miscarriage is seen as the loss of the products of conception prior to the completion of 24 weeks of gestation, with an early pregnancy loss being one that occurs before the 12th completed week of pregnancy (RCOG [Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists] 2006).</p>
                        <p>It is estimated that $10-20\%$ of clinically recognized pregnancies will end in a miscarriage, resulting in 50000 hospital admissions annually. Approximately $1-2\%$ of second trimester pregnancies will result in a miscarriage (RCOG 2011a). Methods of managing pregnancy loss are currently evolving, with more emphasis being placed on medical intervention and/or management.</p>
                        <p>In all cases of miscarriage, the woman and her family will need guidance and support from those caring for her. In all areas of communication, the language used should be appropriate, avoiding medical terms, and be respectful of the pregnancy loss. Following the miscarriage, the parents may wish to see and hold their baby, and will need to be supported in doing this by those caring for them. Even where there is no recognizable baby, some parents are comforted by being given this opportunity (SANDS [Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society 2007]). It is also important to create memories for the parents in the form of photographs, and, for pregnancy losses in the second and third trimesters, footprints and handprints may be taken (see Chapter 26).</p>
                        <p>For a pregnancy loss prior to 24 weeks’ gestation, there is no legal requirement for a baby’s birth to be registered or for a burial or cremation to take place. However, many National Health Service (NHS) facilities now make provision for a service for these babies, or parents may choose to make their own arrangements. In the case of cremation, the parents should be advised that there are very few or no ashes.</p>
                        <p>Following a miscarriage, blood tests may be carried out on the woman, and depending on gestational age, the parents may be offered a post mortem examination of the fetal remains in an effort to try to establish a reason for the pregnancy loss. However, in many cases there is no identifiable cause. Should this be the case, the outlook for future pregnancies is generally good. Many early pregnancy losses are due to chromosomal malformations, resulting in a fetus that does not develop. Should a reason for the miscarriage be identified, it may be of some comfort to the woman allowing for medical management to be put in place to enable a subsequent pregnancy to be more successful.</p>
                        <p>A spontaneous miscarriage may present in a number of ways, all associated with a history of bleeding and/or lower abdominal pain.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>threatened miscarriage</strong> occurs where there is vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy, which may or may not be accompanied by abdominal pain. The cervical os remains closed, and in about $80\%$ of women presenting with these symptoms a viable pregnancy will continue.</p>
                        <p>Where the abdominal pain persists and the bleeding increases, the cervix opens and the products of conception will pass into the vagina in an <strong>inevitable miscarriage</strong>. Should some of the products be retained, this is termed an <strong>incomplete miscarriage</strong>. Infection is a risk with incomplete miscarriage and therapeutic termination of pregnancy. The signs and symptoms of miscarriage are present, accompanied by uterine tenderness, offensive vaginal discharge and pyrexia. In some cases this may progress to overwhelming sepsis, with the accompanying symptoms of hypotension, renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The remaining products may be passed spontaneously to become a <strong>complete miscarriage</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Where there is a <strong>missed or silent miscarriage</strong> a pregnancy sac with identifiable fetal parts is seen on ultrasound examination, but there is no fetal heart beat. There may be some abdominal pain and bleeding but the products of the pregnancy are not always passed spontaneously.</p>
                        <p>The first priority with any woman presenting with vaginal bleeding is to ensure that she is haemodynamically stable. Profuse bleeding may occur where the products of conception are partially expelled through the cervix.</p>
                        <p>Human chorionic gonadotrophic hormone (hCG) is present in the maternal blood from 9-10 days following conception, and assessing hCG levels may be used as an indication of the pregnancy’s viability. Where a woman has persistent bleeding serial readings can be taken to assess the progress of a pregnancy or distinguish an ectopic pregnancy from a complete miscarriage where the uterus is empty on an ultrasound scan. The levels of hCG double every 48 hours in a normal intrauterine pregnancy from 4 to 6 weeks of gestation.</p>
                        <p>As a pregnancy progresses, transvaginal ultrasound and/ or abdominal ultrasound may be used to confirm the presence or absence of a viable pregnancy sac (RCOG 2006). A gentle vaginal or speculum examination may also be performed to ascertain if the cervical os is open, and to observe for the presence of any products of conception within the vagina.</p>
                        <p>In the case of threatened miscarriage where viability of the pregnancy has been confirmed, there is no specific treatment as the likelihood of the pregnancy progressing is usually good. The practice of bed rest to preserve pregnancy is not supported by evidence so women should be neither encouraged nor discouraged from doing this.</p>
                        <p>For a complete miscarriage, there also is no required treatment if the woman’s condition is stable, apart from the support and guidance she and her family will require to deal with their loss.</p>
                        <p>If there are retained products of conception, an incomplete or missed miscarriage, the options for treatment will often depend on gestational age and the condition of the woman. Miscarriages may be managed surgically, medically or expectantly. In many cases the appropriate management is to wait for the products of the conception to be passed spontaneously. However women should be aware that this can take several weeks (RCOG 2006). Women adopting this option should be given full information regarding the probable sequence of events and be provided with contact details for further advice, with the option of admission to hospital if required. It is important that women are educated to actively observe for signs of infection and know what to do if they suspect this.</p>
                        <p>The surgical method, where the uterine cavity is evacuated of the retained products of conception (ERPC) prior to 14 weeks’ gestation is suitable for women who do not want to be managed expectantly and who are not suitable for medical management. Under either a general or local anaesthetic the cervix is dilated and a suction curettage is used to empty the uterus. The use of prostaglandins prior to surgery makes the cervix easier to dilate, thus reducing the risk of cervical damage. Between 1 and $2\%$ of surgical evacuations result in serious morbidity for the woman with the main complications being perforation of the uterus, tears to the cervix and haemorrhage.</p>
                        <p>Medical management of miscarriages includes a variety of regimes involving the use of prostaglandins, such as misoprostol, and may include the use of an antiprogesterone such as mifepristone for a missed miscarriage, or progesterone alone for an incomplete miscarriage. The success rates for medically managed miscarriages vary from 13 to $96\%$ (RCOG 2006) depending on the gestation and size of the gestational sac. Often women will spend time at home between the administration of the first drug and subsequent treatment, so it should be ensured that they have full knowledge of what might happen and a contact number to use at any time. Although the complications include abdominal pain and bleeding, overall the medical management of miscarriage reduces both the number of hospital admissions and the time women spend in hospital.</p>
                        <h3>Recurrent miscarriage</h3>
                        <p>Tests may be carried out on the woman and fetus following a miscarriage to try to establish any underlying cause. This is especially important where there is a history of recurrent miscarriage. Following a history of three or more miscarriages a referral is usually made to a specialist recurrent miscarriage clinic (RCOG 2011a), where appropriate and accurate information and support can be given.</p>
                        <p>Genetic reasons for the miscarriage may be identified through karyotyping of the fetal tissue, as well as both parents. This can cause difficult dilemmas to deal with but more recent genetic engineering is offering hope to some couples. Women should also be tested for lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies, with treatment of low dose aspirin and heparin being initiated if either of these is present. Other treatments depend on the cause, or causes, of the miscarriages being identified.</p>
                        <h3>Ectopic pregnancy</h3>
                        <p>An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized ovum implants outside the uterine cavity, often within the fallopian tube. However, implantation can also occur within the abdominal cavity (for instance on the large intestine or in the Pouch of Douglas), the ovary or in the cervical canal. The incidence is 11.1 per 1000 pregnancies (RCOG 2010a), with 6 deaths attributed to ectopic pregnancy in the 2006-2008 Saving Mother’s Lives report (CEMACE [Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries] 2011).</p>
                        <p>The conceptus produces hCG in the same way as for a uterine pregnancy, maintaining the corpus luteum, which leads to the production of oestrogen and progesterone and the preparation of the uterus to receive the fertilized ovum. However, following implantation in an abnormal site the conceptus continues to grow and in the more common case of an ectopic pregnancy in the fallopian tube, until the tube ruptures, often accompanied by catastrophic bleeding in the woman, or until the embryo dies.</p>
                        <p>Many ectopic pregnancies occur with no identifiable risk factors. However, it is recognized that damage to the fallopian tube through a previous ectopic pregnancy or previous tubular surgery increases the risk, as do previous ascending genital tract infections. Further risk factors include a pregnancy that commences with an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) in situ or the woman conceives while taking the progestogen-only pill.</p>
                        <p>Ectopic (tubal) pregnancies present with vaginal bleeding and a sudden onset of lower abdominal pain, which is initially one sided, but spreads as blood enters the peritoneal cavity. There is referred shoulder tip pain caused by the blood irritating the diaphragm.</p>
                        <p>In $25\%$ of cases, the presentation will be acute, with hypotension and tachycardia. On abdominal palpation there is abdominal distension, guarding and tenderness, which assists in confirming the diagnosis. However, in the majority of cases the presentation is less acute, so there should be a suspicion of ectopic pregnancy in any woman who presents with amenorrhea and lower abdominal pain. In these cases the presentation may be confused with that of a threatened or incomplete miscarriage, thus delaying appropriate treatment.</p>
                        <p>A transvaginal ultrasound of the lower abdomen is a useful diagnostic tool in confirming the site of the pregnancy. A single blood test for hCG level may be either positive (where the corpus luteum remains active) or negative, so is of limited diagnostic value. Serial testing is of greater value.</p>
                        <p>The basis of treatment in the acute, advanced presentation is surgical removal of the conceptus and ruptured fallopian tube as these threaten the life of the woman if she is not stabilized and treated rapidly. In the majority of cases, surgery is currently by laparoscopy as opposed to a laparotomy, as this reduces blood loss, as well as postoperative pain. The ectopic pregnancy may either be removed through an incision in the tube itself, a salpingotomy, or by removing part of the fallopian tube, i.e. a salpingectomy. Although a salpingotomy will enable a higher chance of a uterine pregnancy in the future, it is associated with a higher incidence of subsequent tubal pregnancies (RCOG 2010a).</p>
                        <p>Where the fetus has died, hCG levels will fall and the ectopic pregnancy may resolve itself, with the products either being reabsorbed or miscarried. Medical management is also a choice where the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy is made and the woman is haemodynamically stable. Methotrexate is given in a single dose according to the woman’s body weight (RCOG 2010a), and works by interfering with DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) synthesis, thus preventing the continued growth of the fetus (NHS Choices 2012). Should this be the treatment choice, the woman should be informed that further treatment may be needed as well as how to access support at any time should it be required (RCOG 2010a).</p>
                        <p>Women who are Rhesus-negative should be given anti-D immunoglobulin as recommended by national and local guidelines following any form of pregnancy loss (RCOG 2011b). (See Box 12.2 for further information.)</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 12.2 Note on anti-D immunoglobulin</h4>
                            <p>For all women who are Rhesus-negative, there is an increased risk of sensitization occurring during any form of pregnancy loss, and threatened miscarriage (NICE 2011). Anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis should be considered for non-sensitized women presenting with a history of bleeding after 12 weeks’ gestation. Where the bleeding persists throughout the pregnancy, anti-D should be repeated at 6 -weekly intervals. Anti-D immunoglobulin should also be administered to all non-sensitized Rhesus-negative women following miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy or therapeutic termination of pregnancy (RCOG 2011b).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Inelastic cervix</h3>
                        <p>Formally known as incompetent cervix, an inelastic cervix will lead to silent, painless dilatation of the cervix and loss of the products of conception, either as a miscarriage, or a preterm birth. The incidence is $1: 100-1: 2000$ pregnancies, the large variation being due to differences in populations (Ludmir and Owen 2007).</p>
                        <p>The cervix consists mainly of connective tissue, collagen, elastin, smooth muscle and blood vessels, and undergoes complex changes during pregnancy. The exact mechanism for inelastic cervix is unknown, but the risk is increased where there has been trauma to the cervix during surgical procedures such as a dilatation and curettage or cone biopsy, or the weakness may be of congenital origin.</p>
                        <p>The diagnosis of an inelastic cervix is usually made retrospectively on review of gynaecological and obstetric history. There will have been a painless dilatation of the cervix typically at around 18-20 weeks of gestation, or on digital vaginal or ultrasound examination, the length of the cervical canal may be noted to have shortened without any accompanying pain.</p>
                        <p>A cervical cerclage may be inserted. However the evidence to support this procedure is weak, and both the procedure and the implications should be fully discussed with the woman (NICE [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence] 2007). A suture is inserted from 14 weeks’ gestation at the level of the internal os, and remains in situ until 38 weeks’ gestation, unless there are earlier signs of labour. The associated risks are that the cervix may dilate with the suture in situ, leading to lacerations of the cervix, and infection. In $3\%$ of cases, the cervix fails to dilate during labour, resulting in a caesarean section (Ludmir and Owen 2007).</p>
                        <h3>Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD)</h3>
                        <p>In this condition there is abnormal placental development, resulting in either a complete hydatidiform mole or a partial mole and there is no viable fetus. The grape-like appearance of the mole is due to the over-proliferation of chorionic villi. Usually this is a benign condition which becomes apparent in the second trimester, characterized by vaginal bleeding, a larger than expected uterus, hyperemesis gravidarum and often symptoms of pre-eclampsia. However if a molar pregnancy does not spontaneously miscarry, two associated disorders can occur; gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) where the mole remains in situ and is diagnosed by continuing raised hCG levels and ultrasound scanning, and choriocarcinoma, which can arise as a malignant variation of the disease. It is thought that $3\%$ of complete hydatidiform moles will progress to choriocarcinoma.</p>
                        <p>In the UK, GTD is a rare event, but women of Asian origin are at higher risk. Age is also a risk factor for both teenagers and women over 45 years of age. However, 90% of molar pregnancies occur in women between the ages of 18 and 40 years (Copeland and Landon 2011). Other risk factors include a previous molar pregnancy and those with blood type Group A. Treatment is by evacuation of the uterus, followed by histology of the tissue to enable accurate diagnosis of molar pregnancy (RCOG 2010b).</p>
                        <p>Due to the risk of carcinoma developing following a molar pregnancy, all cases should be followed up at a trophoblastic screening centre, with serial blood or urine hCG levels being monitored. In the UK, this programme has resulted in 98-100% of cases being successfully treated and only $5-8\%$ requiring chemotherapy (RCOG 2010b). Where the hCG levels are within normal limits within 56 days of the end of the pregnancy, follow-up continues for a further 6 months. However, if the hCG levels remain raised at this point, the woman will continue to be assessed until the levels are within normal limits. Following subsequent pregnancies, hCG levels should be monitored for 6-8 weeks to ensure that there is no recurrence of the disease (RCOG 2010b).</p>
                        <p>Following a hydatidiform mole, those women who are Rhesus-negative should be administered anti-D immunoglobulin as recommended by national and local guidelines. (See Box 12.2. for further information.)</p>
                        <h3>Uterine fibroid degeneration</h3>
                        <p>Fibroids (leiomyomas) can degenerate during pregnancy as a result of their diminishing blood supply, resulting in abdominal pain as the tissue becomes ischaemic and necrotic. Suitable analgesia and rest are indicated until the pain subsides, although it can be a recurring problem throughout a pregnancy. Not all fibroids degenerate during pregnancy as some may receive an increased blood supply, causing enlargement with the consequential impact of obstructing labour.</p>
                        <h3>Induced abortion/termination of pregnancy</h3>
                        <p>Under the terms of the Abortion Act 1967, amended by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, provision is made for a pregnancy to be terminated up to 24 weeks of pregnancy for a number of reasons and with the written agreement of two registered medical practitioners The medical practitioners must agree that, in their opinion, the termination is justified under the terms of the statutory Act (see Box 12.3) In the UK, in 2011, 189931 terminations of pregnancy were undertaken: the majority of these occurring before 20 weeks’ gestation (Department of Health 2012). It should be noted that the law in Ireland does not allow for pregnancies to be terminated unless it is to preserve the life of the woman (RCOG 2011c).</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 12.3 Statutory grounds for termination of pregnancy</h4>
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>that the pregnancy has not exceeded its twentyfourth week and that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated, of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family; or</li>
                                <li>that the termination is necessary to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman; or</li>
                                <li>that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated; or</li>
                                <li>that there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p><small>Abortion Act 1967; amended by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990</small></p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>The majority of terminations in the UK are carried out under clause (a) of the Abortion Act, meaning that continuing the pregnancy would involve a greater mental or physical risk to the woman or her existing family than if the pregnancy were terminated. Prior to any termination of pregnancy, the woman should receive counselling to discuss the options available. Whatever the reason for the termination, support should be offered before, during and following the procedure. In many cases the care and support provided for women experiencing a spontaneous miscarriage will also apply to those undergoing an induced termination of pregnancy. The reasons for the termination may include malformations of the fetus that are incompatible with life, or a condition that adversely affects the health of the women such that terminating the pregnancy offers the best option to expedite appropriate and timely treatment.</p>
                        <p>Before the commencement of the termination, it must be ensured that the HSA1 form, which is a legal requirement of the Abortion Act 1967 has been completed and signed by the two medical personnel agreeing to the termination. In addition, it is also a legal requirement that the Chief Medical Officer is notified of all terminations of pregnancy that take place, within 14 days of their occurrence (RCOG 2011c), by the practitioners completing form HSA4. The data on this form is then used for statistical purposes and monitoring terminations of pregnancies that take place within the UK. Only a medical practitioner can terminate a pregnancy. However, in practice, drugs that are prescribed to induce the termination may be administered by registered nurses and midwives working in this area of clinical practice.</p>
                        <p>The methods used for terminating the pregnancy will depend on the gestational age. Prior to 14 weeks’ gestation, the pregnancy is generally terminated surgically by gradually dilating the cervix with a series of dilators and evacuating the uterus via vacuum aspiration or suction curettes. This may be carried out under general or local anaesthesia.</p>
                        <p>Terminations in later pregnancy are carried out medically, using a regime of drugs to prepare and dilate the cervix. The actual regime used may vary across healthcare providers. The cervix is initially prepared using mifepristone, which is a progesterone antagonist. This is given orally, and is followed $36-48$ hours later by vaginal and/ or oral prostaglandins, such as misoprostol. The woman may return home in between the administration of the two drugs and should be provided with clear information about what to expect, the contact details of a named healthcare professional and the reassurance that admission to hospital can be at any time. During the termination, analgesia appropriate to her needs should be available.</p>
                        <p>A termination of pregnancy should not result in the live birth of the fetus. To this effect, should the procedure take place after 21 weeks and 6 days gestation, feticide may be performed prior to the commencement of the termination process. This involves an injection of potassium chloride being injected into the fetal heart to prevent the fetus being born alive (RCOG 2011c).</p>
                        <p>Where nurses and midwives have a conscientious objection to termination of pregnancy, they have the right to refuse to be involved in such procedures. However, they cannot refuse to give life-saving care to a woman, and must always be non-judgemental in any care and contact that they provide (NMC 2012b).</p>
                        <p>As with other pregnancy losses, those women who undergo a termination of pregnancy and are Rhesusnegative will require anti-D immunoglobulin as recommended by national and local guidelines. (See Box 12.2 for further information.)</p>
                        <h3>Pregnancy problems associated with assisted conception</h3>
                        <p>There are a number of techniques available to attempt assisted conception for women and couples who have fertility problems. However, achieving a pregnancy is not always the end of the difficulties that may occur.</p>
                        <p>A serious condition that may occur is that of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. When fertility drugs have been taken to stimulate the production of follicles, massive enlargement of the ovaries and multiple cysts can develop (RCOG 2007). Many women taking fertility drugs will experience a mild form of this syndrome, but in a considerable percentage ($0.5-5\%$) this develops to include oliguria, renal failure and hypovolaemic shock (Mahomed 2011b). This risk increases when pregnancy has been achieved. The condition itself subsides spontaneously, but medical support and treatment is required for those who are severely unwell.</p>
                        <p>In assisted conception, the risk of miscarriage is approximately $14.7\%$. This rate is probably associated with the quality and length of freezing of the oocytes or embryos that are used. However there are no differences in the number of chromosomal malformations when compared with spontaneous pregnancies (Mahomed 2011b).</p>
                        <p>The number of multiple pregnancies increases with assisted conception, with rates of $27\%$ for twins and $3\%$ for triplets (Mahomed 2011b). Assisted reproductive technology accounts for $1\%$ of all births, but $18\%$ of all multiple births; consequently multiple birth in itself is a risk factor for pregnancy (see Chapter 14). With all pregnancies resulting from assisted techniques, there is an increase in the rate of pre-term birth, small for gestational age babies, placenta praevia, pregnancy induced hypertension and gestational diabetes. The reasons for these rates are not known, but it is considered that they relate to the original factors leading to the infertility (Mahomed 2011b).</p>
