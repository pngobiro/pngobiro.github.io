                        <p>The term 'multiple pregnancy' is used to describe the development of more than one fetus in utero at the same time. Families expecting a multiple birth have different health needs, requiring extra practical support and understanding throughout pregnancy, the postnatal period and the early years. Information and support from well-informed healthcare professionals from the time the multiple pregnancy is diagnosed will help to prepare the parents and avoid potential problems.</p>

                        <p>The incidence of multiple births in England and Wales continues to rise. In 2012 there were 11441 multiple births, a rate of 15.7 per 1000 maternities or 1 in 63 with 11330 twins, 208 triplets and 5 quads (Table 14.1, Fig. 14.1) (ONS [Office of National Statistics] 2013).</p>
                        <p>In the 1940s and 1950s, the incidence of twins was 1 in 80 but then fell to 1 in 104 in 1979. The full explanation for the fall is unknown. The number of triplets born more than trebled in the 15 years up to 2001 (Blondel and Kaminski 2002). The highest number in any one year was 323 in 1998; this was due to the rise in treatments for infertility such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and ovulation-stimulating drugs.</p>
                        <p>The single most important reason for the rise in multiple births is assisted conception (Black and Bhattacharya 2010), although women having children when they are older is a contributory factor though less significant. Multiple birth is the greatest single risk to the health and welfare of babies born after IVF due to the increased rates of stillbirth, preterm birth, neonatal death and disabilities. Maternal complications are also higher with a multiple pregnancy. Concern about the increased morbidity and mortality and high costs for health and social care led the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to commission an expert group to review multiple births after IVF. The report 'One Child at a Time' (Braude 2006) has led to significant changes in practice to reduce iatrogenic multiple births. Elective single embryo transfer in IVF cycles is the normal practice in the UK with spare good-quality embryos frozen for replacement in later cycles (Cutting et al 2008). The 'One at a Time' policy is supported by professional bodies and relevant organizations (Consensus Statement 2011).</p>

                        <h3>Types of twin pregnancy</h3>
                        <p>Twins will be either monozygotic (MZ) or dizygotic (DZ). Monozygotic or uniovular twins are also referred to as 'identical twins'. They develop from the fusion of one oocyte and one spermatozoon, which after fertilization splits into two (Chapter 5). These twins will be of the same sex and have the same genes, blood groups and physical features, such as eye and hair colour, ear shapes and palm creases. However, they may be of different sizes and often have very different personalities and characters.</p>
                        <p>Dizygotic or binovular twins develop when two separate oocytes are fertilized by two different spermatozoa; they are often referred to as fraternal or non-identical twins. They are no more alike than any brother or sister and can be of the same or different sex. In any multiple pregnancy there is a 50:50 chance of a girl or boy, half of dizygotic twins will be boy-girl pairs. A quarter of dizygotic twins will be both boys and a quarter, both girls. Of all twins born in the UK, two-thirds will be dizygotic and one-third monozygotic. Therefore, approximately one-third of twins are girls, one-third boys and one-third girl-boy pairs.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Determination of zygosity and chorionicity</h3>
                        <p>Midwives must understand the differences between these two terms (Table 14.2) and why it is important.</p>
                        <p>Determination of zygosity means determining whether or not the twins are monozygotic (identical) or dizygotic (non-identical). In about one-third of all twins born, it will be obvious as the children will be of a different sex. Of the remaining same-sex twins, zygosity will usually be apparent from physical features by the time the children are 2 years old, although parents are not usually prepared to wait this long. By the age of 2, parents know their children so well and see their differences in character and personalities that they often find it difficult to believe they are identical. At birth, monochorionic twins can have a greater weight variation than dichorionic twins. In approximately two-thirds of monozygotic twins, a monochorionic diamniotic placenta (MCDA) will confirm monozygosity. If the babies have a single outer membrane, the chorion, they must be monochorionic and so monozygotic (Fig. 14.2).</p>

                        <p>In one-third of monozygotic twins, the placenta will have two chorions and two amnions (DCDA), and either fused placentas (Fig. 14.2C) or two separate placentas (dichorionic) (Fig. 14.2A), which is indistinguishable from the situation in dizygotic twins.</p>
                        <p>With monozygotic twins the type of placenta produced is determined by the time at which the fertilized oocyte splits:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>0-4 days: dichorionic diamniotic placenta DCDA (approx. 33% - 1/3 cases) (Fig. 14.2 A, C)</li>
                            <li>4-8 days: monochorionic diamniotic placenta MCDA (approx. 66% - 2/3 cases) (Fig. 14.2B)</li>
                            <li>8-12 days: monochorionic monoamniotic placenta MCMA (approx. 1% of cases) (Fig. 14.2D)</li>
                            <li>12-13 days: (very rare indeed) conjoined twins can develop when the division is incomplete (Bomsel-Helmreich 2005).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Despite the well-established facts about placentation and zygosity, professionals are still giving couples incorrect information. Same-sex dichorionic twins can be either non-identical or identical and it is only from either an amniocentesis whilst pregnant or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing after the birth that accurate zygosity can be known.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Chorionicity: why is it important to know?</h4>
                        <p>This knowledge is important clinically because monochorionic twin pregnancies have a 3-5 times higher risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity than dichorionic twin pregnancies (Pasquini et al 2004).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Zygosity determination after birth</h4>
                        <p>The most accurate method of determining zygosity is to compare DNA from each baby. The DNA can be extracted from cells taken from a cheek swab from inside the mouth. Specific genetic markers extracted from different chromosomes are compared and the results are up to 99.99% accurate. (For DNA testing, contact the Multiple Births Foundation [MBF].)</p>
                        <p>Zygosity determination should be routinely offered to all same-sex dichorionic twins for the following reasons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Most parents will want to know whether or not their twins are identical, so they can answer the most commonly asked question: 'Are they identical?' Also as the twins get older, they usually want to know.</li>
                            <li>If couples are considering further pregnancies, the risk in DZ twin pregnancy increases approximately five-fold: these tend to run in families, usually on the female side. MZ twins do not run in families and the likelihood does not change (except in rare families who carry a dominant gene for monozygotic twinning). The chance of any fertile woman having MZ twins is approximately 1 in 350-400.</li>
                            <li>It will help the twins in establishing their sense of identity; influence their life and family relationships.</li>
                            <li>The information is important for genetic reasons, not just with monogenic disorders but with any serious illness later in life.</li>
                            <li>Twins are frequently asked to be involved in research and for this knowledge of zygosity is essential.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Diagnosis of twin pregnancy</h3>
                        <p>This is usually through ultrasound examination. Diagnosis can be made as early as 6 weeks, particularly for women who have had treatment for infertility, but usually at the early scan between 11 weeks and 13 weeks and 6 days (Chapter 11). If the pregnancy is diagnosed at 6 weeks, the woman should be told about the risk of 'vanishing twin syndrome' (Landy et al 1998).</p>
                        <p>The differences between the two types of placenta are more pronounced in the first trimester, so it is important to establish chorionicity at the early scan. The chorions forming the septum between the amniotic sacs can be seen more clearly and the membrane thickness measured, or by studying the septum at its base adjacent to the placenta where a tongue of placental tissue is seen ultrasonically between the two chorions; this is termed the lambda or T-sign (Wood et al 1996).</p>
                        <p>Once a multiple pregnancy has been diagnosed nomenclature should be assigned to each baby (e.g. A and B, or upper and lower).</p>
                        <p>The news that a woman is expecting a multiple pregnancy should be broken to the couple in a sensitive manner as it may be a huge shock. At diagnosis the mother must be given relevant information about the pregnancy, be referred to a specialist multiple pregnancy clinic, and given website addresses or telephone numbers of local and national support organizations (see Useful Websites).</p>
                        <p>Since the advent of routine ultrasound scanning, it is very rare for a woman to get to term with undiagnosed twins, but this will not apply in areas where this technology is unavailable, or where the mother declines.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A multiple pregnancy tends to be shorter than a single pregnancy. The average gestation for twins is 37 weeks, triplets 34 weeks and quadruplets 32 weeks.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Antenatal screening</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A healthcare professional experienced in twin and triplet pregnancies should offer information and counselling before and after every screening test.</li>
                            <li>Screening for Down syndrome is by the combined test (see Chapter 11).</li>
                            <li>Amniocentesis can be performed in twin pregnancies, usually between 15 and 20 weeks. It should be performed in a specialist fetal medicine unit. Most obstetricians prefer to do a dual needle insertion so there is no chance of contamination between the two sac.</li>
                            <li>The role of chorionic villus sampling (CVS) with dichorionic placentas remains controversial because of a relatively high risk of cross-contamination of chorionic tissue, which may lead to false-positive or false-negative results. Such procedures should only be performed after detailed counseling (RCOG (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists) 2010).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Monochorionic twin pregnancies should be scanned every 2 weeks from 16 to 24 weeks to check for discordant fetal growth and signs of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). A detailed cardiac scan should be included with the anomaly scan due to increased incidence of cardiac problems with MZ twins; if uncomplicated after 24 weeks, then the same as dichorionic twins.</li>
                            <li>Dichorionic twin pregnancies should be scanned monthly from 16 weeks, with the anomaly scan between 18+0 to 20+6 weeks.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Antenatal care and preparation</h3>
                        <p>Early diagnosis of a twin pregnancy and of chorionicity is extremely important in order to give parents the specialist support and advice they will need.</p>
                        <p>Clinical care for women with twin and triplet pregnancies should be provided by a nominated multidisciplinary team consisting of: a core team of named specialist obstetricians, specialist midwives and ultrasonographers, all of whom have experience and knowledge of managing multiple pregnancies.</p>
                        <p>An enhanced team for referrals should include: a women's physiotherapist, an infant feeding specialist, a dietitian and a perinatal mental health professional. The type of care pathway the woman will follow for her antenatal care will depend on whether she is expecting monochorionic or dichorionic twins. Women expecting an uncomplicated monochorionic twin pregnancy should be offered at least nine antenatal appointments with healthcare professionals from the core team. At least two of these should be with the specialist obstetrician. Women with uncomplicated dichorionic twin pregnancies should be offered at least eight antenatal appointments with a healthcare professional from the core team, and two of these with the specialist obstetrician (NICE [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence] 2011).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Parent education</h3>
                        <p>Routine parent education classes should be offered earlier for women expecting twins, ideally around 22-24 weeks’ gestation. A specialist class for couples expecting a multiple birth would be the ideal (Owen et al 2004). When planning these classes, contact with a local twins club can provide a valuable source of practical information. Mothers from twins clubs are usually delighted to participate in the classes and talk on the practical issues such as coping with two or more babies, equipment and breastfeeding (Leonard and Denton 2006). Suggestions for class topics are listed in Box 14.1.</p>
                        <p>The news a multiple pregnancy is expected can come as a considerable shock and the midwife should give couples the opportunity to discuss any worries or problems they have, as two babies will add a considerable financial burden to any family's income (Denton and Bryan 1995).</p>

                        <h3>Preparation for breastfeeding</h3>
                        <p>Women will inevitably give a lot of thought to how they are going to feed their babies, not only from the nutritional but also from the practical point of view, as feeding will take up a large amount of their time during the first 6 months. Women should be encouraged right from the beginning that it is not only possible to breastfeed two, and in some cases three babies, but it is the best way for her to feed her babies nutritionally and it can be a very rewarding experience for her (see Fig. 14.6). Many sets of twins have been entirely breastfed, some beyond their first birthdays. Very few sets of triplets are totally breastfed (Leonard 2000), but many mothers manage to combine breast and bottlefeeding very successfully.</p>
                        <p>Early in the antenatal period the woman should be given full information and advice about both breast- and bottlefeeding, so she can make an informed choice on how to feed her babies. Both parents should have the opportunity to ask questions and be encouraged to meet another mother who is successfully breastfeeding her babies (Box 14.2). Introductions can usually be made through a local twins group (MBF 2011a, 2011b).</p>

                        <h3>Abdominal examination</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Inspection</h4>
                        <p>On inspection, the size of the uterus may be larger than expected for the period of gestation, particularly after the 20th week. The uterus may look broad or round and fetal movements may be seen over a wide area, although the findings are not diagnostic of twins. Fresh striae gravidarum may be apparent. Up to twice the amount of amniotic fluid is normal in a twin pregnancy but polyhydramnios is not an uncommon complication of a twin pregnancy, particularly with monochorionic twins.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Palpation</h4>
                        <p>On palpation, the fundal height may be greater than expected for the period of gestation. The presence of two fetal poles (head or breech) in the fundus of the uterus may be revealed on palpation and multiple fetal limbs may also be palpable. The head may be small in relation to the size of the uterus and may suggest that the fetus is also small and therefore there may be more than one present. Lateral palpation may reveal two fetal backs, or limbs on both sides. Pelvic palpation may give findings similar to those on fundal palpation, although one fetus may lie behind the other and make detection difficult. Location of three poles in total is diagnostic of at least two fetuses.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Auscultation</h4>
                        <p>Hearing two fetal hearts is not diagnostic as one can often be heard over a wide area in a singleton pregnancy. If simultaneous comparison over one minute of the heart rates reveals a difference of at least 10 bpm, it may be assumed that two hearts are being heard beating.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Effects of pregnancy</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Exacerbation of common disorders</h4>
                        <p>The presence of more than one fetus in utero and the higher levels of circulating hormones often exacerbate the common disorders of pregnancy. Sickness, nausea and heartburn may be more persistent and more troublesome than in a singleton pregnancy.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Anaemia</h4>
                        <p>Iron and folic acid deficiency anaemias are common in twin pregnancies. Early growth and development of the uterus and its contents make greater demands on the maternal iron stores; in later pregnancy (after the 28th week), fetal demands may lead to anaemia. Routine oral iron supplementation remains a controversial issue (Lassi et al 2013), but all pregnant women are advised to take folic acid daily (NICE 2008).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Polyhydramnios</h4>
                        <p>This is also common and is particularly associated with monochorionic twins and with fetal abnormalities. Polyhydramnios will add to any discomfort that the woman is already experiencing. If acute polyhydramnios occurs, it can lead to miscarriage or preterm labour.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Pressure symptoms</h4>
                        <p>The increased weight and size of the uterus and its contents may be troublesome. Impaired venous return from the lower limbs increases the tendency to varicose veins and oedema of the legs. Backache is common and the increased uterine size may also lead to marked dyspnoea and indigestion.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Other</h4>
                        <p>There can be an increase in complications of pregnancy such as obstetric cholestasis, and pelvic girdle pain (PGP) (see Chapters 12 and 13).</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-4" class="section-heading">LABOUR AND THE BIRTH</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Onset</h3>
                        <p>The more fetuses the woman is carrying, the earlier labour is likely to start. Twins are usually born around 37 weeks rather than 40 weeks, and approximately 60% of twins are born spontaneously before 37 weeks' gestation. In addition to being preterm, the babies may be small for gestational age (SFGA) and therefore prone to the associated complications of both conditions. If spontaneous labour begins before 24 weeks, the chances of survival outside the uterus are very small, but it is possible the woman can be given drugs to inhibit uterine activity. Causes of preterm labour must, if at all possible, be diagnosed and treated quickly; for example, urinary tract infection should be treated with antibiotics. Antenatal corticosteroids are usually given to all women of multiple pregnancies before 36 weeks' gestation (NICE 2011).</p>
                        <p>Evidence shows that after 38 weeks' gestation there is increased risk of higher mortality in babies (Udom-Rice et al 2000), most obstetricians advise induction of labour by 38 weeks for dichorionic twins and between 36 and 37 weeks (Box 14.3) for monochorionic twins (RCOG 2006). In dichorionic pregnancies, if the first twin is a cephalic presentation, labour is usually allowed to continue to a vaginal birth, but if the first twin is presenting in any other way, an elective caesarean section (CS) is usually recommended (Fig. 14.3). For uncomplicated monochorionic twin pregnancies women are generally offered a vaginal birth, but for complicated monochorionic pregnancies birth is by elective CS. For triplets and above, the mode of birth is almost always by CS.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 14.3 Case history 1</h4>
                            <p>A 34-year-old primigravida was diagnosed with DCDA twins, no family history, so it was a complete shock. At the ultrasound department, a leaflet with local twin organizations and contacts was given to the mother. Through the hospital specialist, multiple birth midwife and twins club the mother started to come to terms with the prospect of twins. She knew she was expecting two boys and began to wonder if they were identical or not, but would have to wait until they were born and have DNA tests if they looked alike. She had a straightforward birth with her first child, so she was keen to have a vaginal birth again, but felt there was pressure on her to have an elective caesarean section. The pregnancy progressed normally and with support from the specialist midwife, she wrote her birth plan. The presenting baby was cephalic, and at 38 weeks labour was induced. The woman had an epidural and progressed to birth both babies vaginally after a short labour. Both babies were put to her breast in the labour suite; twin one sucked well but twin two was not interested. As establishing feeding was more problematic than she expected and she felt she needed a lot of help from the midwives, the mother stayed in hospital until day 5. Both babies were sucking well on return home, although twin two did occasionally need a 'top up' from the bottle.</p>

                        <h3>Management of labour</h3>
                        <p>During antenatal classes the couple must be warned that a multiple birth is less common and therefore, for educational purposes in the hospital setting, a number of professionals may ask to observe the birth. If the woman has any objection to this, her wishes must be respected and a record made in her notes that she wants only those concerned with her care to be present. Home births are not advisable with a multiple pregnancy, but some women may still request one, in which case every effort should be made to support her decision with an uncomplicated pregnancy. This will require meticulous risk assessment and planning, including the involvement of midwifery supervision in order that a plan of care for labour is clearly articulated and documented in the woman's records. A skilled team of midwives with confidence to deliver intrapartum care to women with twin pregnancies at home will need to be identified to be on call. It is good practice for the midwifery team to liaise with and communicate the plan of care to the paramedic team and local consultantled unit.</p>
                        <p>The majority of women expecting twins will go into labour spontaneously. Theoretically the duration of the first stage of labour should be no different from that of a single pregnancy. However, there is an increased incidence of dysfunctional labour in twin pregnancies, possibly because of overdistension of the uterus.</p>
                        <p>The presence of complications such as pregnancy-induced hypertension, obstetric cholestasis, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome may be reasons for earlier induction of labour.</p>
                        <p>Labour for women expecting twins must be recognized as high risk and continuous electronic fetal heart monitoring (EFM) of both fetuses is advocated. This can be achieved either with two external transducers or, once the membranes are ruptured, a scalp electrode on the presenting twin and an external transducer on the second. If a 'twin monitor' is available, both heartbeats can be monitored simultaneously to give a more reliable reading. Uterine activity will also need to be monitored.</p>
                        <p>If cardiotocography (CTG) is not available (e.g. a home birth), use of hand-held Dopplers may be more pragmatic for structured intermittent fetal heart rates (FHRs) auscultation than a Pinard's stethoscope. If the latter has to be used, two people must auscultate simultaneously, so that the two distinct FHRs are counted over the same minute.</p>
                        <p>While in labour, the woman should be encouraged to adopt whichever position she finds most comfortable. A foam rubber wedge under the side of the mattress will help to prevent supine hypotensive syndrome by giving a lateral tilt. It may be preferable for her to adopt a left lateral position, well supported by pillows or a beanbag. A birthing chair or a reclining chair, if available, may be more comfortable than a conventional labour suite birthing bed.</p>
                        <p>Regional epidural block provides excellent analgesia, and if necessary, allows easier instrumental births and also manipulation of the second twin. The use of Entonox analgesia may be helpful, either before the epidural is in situ or during the second stage, if the effect of the epidural is wearing off.</p>
                        <p>The woman should be encouraged to use whatever form of relaxation she finds helpful. If she chooses to use pharmacological means of analgesia only after nonpharmacological methods are no longer effective, her wishes should be respected. The midwife should explain that, if complications arise, intervention and the use of pharmacological analgesia might be necessary. Ideally this should be discussed with the woman antenatally so that the physiology of labour is not disturbed with new information (Chapter 16).</p>
                        <p>If fetal compromise occurs during labour, the birth will need to be expedited, usually by CS. Action may also need to be taken if the woman's condition gives cause for concern.</p>
                        <p>If uterine activity is poor, the use of intravenous oxytocin may be required once the membranes have been ruptured. Artificial rupture of the membranes (ARM) may be sufficient to stimulate good uterine activity but it may need to be used in conjunction with intravenous oxytocin. The CTG will give a good indication of the pattern of uterine activity, whether the labour is induced or spontaneous. The response of the fetal hearts to uterine contractions can be observed on the CTG.</p>
                        <p>If the babies are expected to be preterm, low birth weight, or known to have any other problems, the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) must be informed that the woman is in labour so they can make the necessary preparations to receive the babies. When birth is imminent, the paediatric team should be summoned.</p>
                        <p>Throughout labour, the emotional and general physical condition of the woman must be considered. She requires the presence of her birthing partner and one-to-one care from the midwife.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Management of the birth</h3>
                        <p>The onset of the second stage of labour should be confirmed by a vaginal examination. In the hospital setting, the obstetrician, paediatric team and anaesthetist should be present for the birth as there is a risk of complications.</p>
                        <p>Epidural analgesia may need to be 'topped up' prior to the birth. The possibility of emergency CS is ever present and the operating theatre should be ready to receive the mother at short notice. Monitoring of both FHRs should continue until birth. Provided that the first twin is presenting by the vertex, the birth can be expected to proceed normally, as with a singleton pregnancy. When the first twin is born, the time of birth and the sex are noted. This baby and cord must be labelled as 'twin one' immediately. The identity tags should be checked with the mother or father before they are applied to the baby in accordance with local policy. The baby may be given to the mother for skin-to-skin contact and encouraged to go to the breast as sucking stimulates uterine contractions (Chapter 34).</p>
                        <p>After the birth of the first twin, abdominal palpation is made to ascertain the lie, presentation (in the event of doubt a portable ultrasound machine should be available) and position of the second twin and to auscultate the FHR to ensure continuous EFM. An assistant may need to stabilize the lie of the second twin. If the lie is not longitudinal, an attempt may be made to correct it by external cephalic version (ECV) (see Chapter 17). ECV in this context in the UK should only be performed or supervised by a senior obstetrician (RCOG 2006). ECV is less invasive than internal podalic version, and will often be the default manoeuvre employed by obstetricians (RCOG 2006; Masson 2007).</p>
                        <p>If it is longitudinal, a vaginal examination is made to confirm the presentation. If the presenting part is not engaged it should be gently guided into the pelvis and kept in place until it firmly engages. ARM must not be performed on the second sac of membranes until the presenting part engages, as risk of cord prolapse is ever present. The FHR must be auscultated again; a scalp electrode might be required following ARM if external monitoring of the FHR is of poor quality If uterine activity does not recommence, intravenous oxytocin may be used.</p>
                        <p>When the presenting part becomes visible, the mother should be encouraged to birth her second twin with contractions. The midwife should always be aware there is a risk the placenta may start to separate before the birth of the second twin, causing oxygen deprivation. The birth will proceed as normal if the presentation is vertex, but if the fetus presents by the breech and the midwife is not experienced in breech births she will need a doctor's assistance.</p>
                        <p>The birth of the second twin should ideally be completed within 45 minutes of the first twin but, as long as there are no signs of fetal compromise in the second twin, it may be allowed to continue longer. If there are signs of compromise, the birth must be expedited and the second twin may need to be born by CS. An uterotonic drug (Syntometrine or oxytocin) is usually given intramuscularly or intravenously, depending on local policy, after the birth of the anterior shoulder as with a singleton pregnancy. This baby and cord are labelled as 'twin two'. The time of birth and sex of child must be noted. If either twin needs to be transferred to the NICU for observation, the mother should have a chance to see and hold the baby whenever possible.</p>
                        <p>Once the uterotonic drug has taken effect, controlled cord traction is applied to both cords simultaneously to aid birth of the placentas without delay. Emptying the uterus enables bleeding to be controlled and postpartum haemorrhage prevented.</p>
                        <p>The placenta(s) should be examined not only to check completion but the number of amniotic sacs, chorions and placentas noted (see Fig. 14.2). If the babies are of different sexes, they are dizygotic. If the placenta is monochorionic (MCDA), they must be monozygotic. If they are of the same sex and the placenta is dichorionic (DCDA), then further tests will be needed (see Zygosity). The umbilical cords should also be examined and the number of cord vessels and the presence of any abnormalities noted.</p>

                        <p>The higher perinatal mortality associated with twinning is largely due to complications of pregnancy, such as the preterm onset of labour, IUGR and complications at birth. There is a six-fold increase in perinatal mortality comparing twins to singletons (CMACE [Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries] 2011). The management of multiple pregnancy is concerned with the prevention, early detection and treatment of these complications.</p>

                        <p>Mentioned earlier in the chapter, acute polyhydramnios may occur as early as 16 weeks. It may be associated with fetal abnormality but is more likely to be due to twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which can also be known as feto-fetal transfusion syndrome (FFTS).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome</h3>
                        <p>Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) can be acute or chronic. The acute form usually occurs during labour and is the result of blood transfusing from one fetus (donor) to the other (recipient) through vascular anastomosis in a monochorionic placenta. Both fetuses may die of cardiac failure if not treated urgently.</p>
                        <p>Chronic TTTS occurs in about 15% of monochorionic twin pregnancies (Dennes et al 2006) and accounts for 15% of perinatal mortality in twins (Yamamoto and Ville 2006). The placenta in TTTS transfuses blood from one twin fetus to the other. These cases are characterized by one or more deep unidirectional arteriovenous anastomoses. This results in anaemia and growth restriction in the donor twin (stuck twin) and polycythaemia with circulatory overload in the recipient twin (hydrops). The fetal and neonatal mortality is high but infants may be saved by early diagnosis and prenatal treatment with either amnioreduction, which may have to be repeated regularly as fluid can reaccumulate rapidly (Box 14.4), or laser ablation therapy of communicating placental vessels, or septostomy (MBF 2010).</p>
                        <p>The midwife should always be alert to the woman who complains of a rapid increase in her abdominal girth in the second trimester, as well as a uterus that feels hard and uncomfortable continuously. The skin over the uterus may look shiny and tight; this is usually due to polyhydramnios and if not treated urgently can cause preterm labour.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 14.4 Case history 2</h4>
                            <p>A 26-year-old primigravida's early scan showed MCDA twins. The mother read on the Internet that problems can be associated with MCDA pregnancy and was very worried about TTTS.</p>
                            <p>From 16 weeks, she had 2-weekly scans for signs of TTTS and growth discordancy. At 20 weeks, she noticed a rapid increase in abdominal size and her tummy was hard and uncomfortable. Her local hospital referred her to the Centre for Fetal Care (CFC) at a tertiary level hospital, where type 2 TTTS was diagnosed. Immediate treatment was amnio-reduction of over 2 litres and laser ablation of connecting blood vessels. Her care was transferred to CFC for weekly scans. Here she mainly saw doctors and felt she missed out on midwife contact. Unfortunately at 32 weeks she was diagnosed as type 3 TTTS, with very abnormal Dopplers in the donor twin. Steroid injections were given and an emergency caesarean section was performed at 33 weeks. Both babies were born in a fair condition and were admitted to the NICU. The mother was encouraged to hand express her milk as soon as she felt well enough, to continue 2-3-hourly during the day and on the 6th day she started expressing using an electric pump. The twins were able to go to the breast after 2 weeks and started sucking for very short periods. Progress continued and both babies were discharged home at 5 weeks of age, fully breastfeeding.</p>

                        <h3>Fetal malformations</h3>
                        <p>This is particularly associated with monochorionic twins.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Conjoined twins</h4>
                        <p>This extremely rare malformation of monozygotic twinning results from the incomplete division of the fertilized oocyte; it occurs once in 50000 births and over half the cases are stillborn. Birth has to be by CS. The site and extent of fusion of the fetuses are infinitely variable. Thoracopagus (conjoined twins united at the thorax) is the commonest form of fusion (over 70% of cases). The feasibility of separating conjoined twins depends on the site and extent of fusion and the degree to which organs are shared (Oleszczuk and Oleszczuk 2005). Many conjoined twins can now be successfully separated. Others pose major ethical dilemmas - particularly if one can be saved at the expense of the other (Mifflin 2001).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Twin reversed arterial perfusion</h4>
                        <p>Twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) occurs in about 1 in 30000 births. In TRAP, one twin presents without a well-defined cardiac structure and is kept alive through placental anastomoses to the circulatory system of the viable fetus (Sebire and Sepulveda 2006).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Fetus-in-fetu</h4>
                        <p>In fetus-in-fetu (endoparasite), parts of a fetus may be lodged within another fetus; this can happen only in MZ twins (Hoeffel et al 2000).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Malpresentations</h3>
                        <p>Although the uterus is large and distended, the fetuses are less mobile than may be supposed. They can restrict each other's movements, which may result in malpresentations (Chapter 20), particularly of the second twin. After the birth of the first twin, the presentation of the second twin may change.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Preterm rupture of the membranes</h3>
                        <p>Malpresentations due to polyhydramnios may predispose to preterm rupture of the membranes.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Cord prolapse</h3>
                        <p>This too is associated with malpresentations and polyhydramnios and is more likely if there is a poorly fitting presenting part. The second twin is particularly at risk of cord prolapse.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Prolonged labour</h3>
                        <p>Malpresentations are a poor stimulus to good uterine action and a distended uterus is likely to lead to poor uterine activity and consequently prolonged labour (Chapter 19).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Monoamniotic twins</h3>
                        <p>Approximately 1% of MZ twins share the same amniotic sac. Monoamniotic (MCMA) twins risk cord entanglement with occlusion of the blood supply through the umbilical cords to one or both fetuses. In some centres this is treated with sulindac, which reduces the amniotic fluid levels, and birth is usually around 32-34 weeks and by elective CS.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Locked twins</h3>
                        <p>This is a very rare but serious complication of twin pregnancy. There are two types. One occurs when the first twin presents by the breech and the second by the vertex; the other when both are vertex presentations (Fig. 14.4). In both instances, the head of the second twin prevents the continued descent of the first. Primigravidae are more at risk than multiparous women.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_28_cbild0e67615951a5g-317-1.jpg" alt="Two diagrams showing locked twins. (A) First twin breech, second twin cephalic, chins are locked. (B) Both twins cephalic, heads are locked.">

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h3>Delay in the birth of the second twin</h3>
                        <p>After the birth of the first twin, uterine activity should recommence within 5 minutes. Ideally, as stated previously, the birth of the second twin should be completed within 45 minutes of the first twin being born but with close monitoring can be extended if there are no signs of fetal compromise. Poor uterine action as a result of malpresentation may be the cause of delay. The risks of such delay are intrauterine hypoxia, birth asphyxia following premature separation of the placenta and sepsis as a result of ascending infection from the first umbilical cord, which lies outside the vulva. After the birth of the first twin the lower uterine segment begins to reform and the cervical canal may have to dilate fully again.</p>
                        <p>The midwife may need to 'rub up' a contraction and put the first twin to the breast to stimulate uterine activity. If there appears to be an obstruction, medical aid is summoned and a CS may be necessary. If there is no obstruction, oxytocin infusion may be commenced or forceps-assisted birth considered.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Premature expulsion of the placenta</h3>
                        <p>The placenta may be expelled before the birth of the second twin. In dichorionic twins with separate placentas, one placenta may be delivered separately; in monochorionic twins the shared placenta may be expelled. The risks of severe asphyxia and death of the second twin are very high. Haemorrhage is also likely if one twin is retained in utero as this prevents adequate retraction of the placental site.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Postpartum haemorrhage</h3>
                        <p>Poor uterine tone as a result of overdistension or hypotonic activity is likely to lead to postpartum haemorrhage (Chapter 18). There is also a much larger placental site to contract down.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Undiagnosed twins</h3>
                        <p>The possibility of an unexpected, undiagnosed second baby (in the UK this is unlikely with ultrasound scanning) should be considered if the uterus appears larger than expected after the birth of the first baby or if the baby is surprisingly smaller than expected. If an uterotonic drug has been given after the birth of the anterior shoulder of the first baby, the second twin is in great danger of birth asphyxia and birth should be expedited. The midwife must break the news of undiagnosed twins gently to the parents. These parents will require special support and guidance during the postnatal period.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Delayed interval birth of the second twin</h3>
                        <p>There have been several reported cases where the first twin has been born, often very prematurely, and then a long gap before labour recommences; it can be days or even weeks before the second twin is born (Zhang et al 2004). This opportunity can be used to give antenatal corticosteroids to the mother to help mature the lungs of the second twin. Careful observations of the mother's condition must be made during this time for signs of infection and fetal compromise. The mother will need additional support from the midwives to cope with her anxieties for her preterm baby on the NICU, which may not survive, or time to grieve if the baby has died, as well as still being pregnant and her concerns for the outcome of her pregnancy.</p>

                        <h3>Care of the babies</h3>
                        <p>Immediate care after the birth is the same as for a single baby. Maintenance of body temperature is vital, particularly if the babies are small; use of overhead heaters will help to prevent heat loss. Identification of the babies should be clear and the parents given the opportunity to check the identity bracelets and cuddle the babies. The babies may need to be admitted to the NICU from the labour suite, otherwise they can be encouraged to have skin-to-skin contact, and go to the breast if they are to be breastfed before being transferred to the postnatal ward with their mother.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Temperature control</h4>
                        <p>Maintenance of a thermoneutral environment is essential, particularly for babies in the NICU. American studies have shown that a sick baby can benefit from sharing the incubator with its twin (Hedberg et al 1998). Clothing should be light but warm, and allow air to circulate.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Feeding</h4>
                        <p>The mother may choose to feed her babies by breast or with formula milk, but whatever her choice, the midwife must support her in her decision. With breastfeeding, both babies may be breastfed separately or simultaneously. In the initial postnatal days, it is recommended she breastfeeds her twins separately, as this gives her time to get to know each baby individually and to feel confident in her ability to cope. If the babies are SFGA or preterm, the paediatricians may recommend that the babies be 'topped up' after a breastfeed. Expressed breastmilk is best for these babies. If the babies are not able to suck adequately at the breast the mother should be encouraged to express her milk regularly. Expressing should be initiated ideally within 6 hours of birth, then regularly every 2-3 hours during the day and once at night or on average 8 times per 24 hours. In some NICUs with a Millbank donor milk may be offered to preterm babies, this reduces the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (Patole and de Klerk 2005). As twin babies are more likely to be preterm or SFGA, their ability to coordinate the sucking and swallowing reflexes may be poor. If so, they may need to be fed intravenously or by nasogastric tube, depending on their size and general condition. The mother should be encouraged to participate in whatever method is used. Careful monitoring of weight gain is required. Hypoglycaemia may occur and regular capillary blood glucose estimations may be needed.</p>
                        <p>In the early postnatal days, mothers often worry that their milk supply is inadequate for two babies. The midwife should reassure her that lactation responds to the demands made by the babies sucking at the breast or expressing. The more stimulation the breasts are given, the more milk she will produce. At feeding times, the midwife must be with the mother to offer support and advice on positioning and fixing the babies (Fig. 14.5), as well as encouraging her in her ability to cope with breastfeeding two babies.</p>

                        <h5>Breastfeeding</h5>
                        <p>The advantages of breastfeeding twins are the same as for singletons (Chapter 34), but as twins have a higher tendency to be born preterm and SFGA, it is even more important that they should be breastfed. As well as the medical and nutritional advantages, there are practical reasons too, many of which are outlined in Chapter 34. Additionally, as time is limited for a mother of twins in the early days, twins can be breastfed together, when the feeds will take only a little longer than with a single baby. Some mothers will, however, prefer to feed separately.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Separate feeding</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It allows her to give one-to-one attention to each baby, something mothers of twins feel they have very little time for.</li>
                            <li>It is easier for the mother, as she has both hands free to position and attach one baby at a time.</li>
                            <li>If she does feed separately, it is recommended that she adopts a routine where whichever baby wakes first is fed and the second one is woken straight afterwards so keeping her feeds together.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h6>Simultaneous feeding</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It saves time as both babies are feeding together, though the mother will need to be organized, and will need help in the early days to get both babies attached to the breast.</li>
                            <li>If the mother does want to feed the babies together, it is advisable to try this before going home from hospital, where a midwife can stay with her throughout the entire feed, providing advice, support and an extra pair of hands.</li>
                            <li>The woman will need additional pillows to support her back and take the weight of the babies, to avoid putting strain on her arms and back (Figs 14.5, 14.6).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Routine is the key to coping with two or more babies. It may take 4-6 weeks for a feeding routine to get established (MBF 2010).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Mother-baby relationships</h3>
                        <p>Mothers with a multiple birth often worry they will find it more difficult to bond with each baby equally. This is a common concern and reassurance that their feelings are not unusual should be given. Once the mother gets to know her babies these feelings usually disappear. If, for example, they are of markedly different sizes, a mother may favour one over the other, or if one baby is in the NICU while the other is on the postnatal ward with her, she may find she bonds with the one on the ward much more quickly. In such cases the mother should be encouraged to spend as much time as possible with the baby on the NICU and to visit as soon after the birth as she feels able. If she has had an operative birth, she may find it difficult to care for two babies and extreme tiredness or anaemia will exacerbate the situation. She may have feelings of guilt if the birth and immediate postnatal period have not gone as she had planned. The midwife should be alert for such circumstances and help the mother to divide her attention between both babies and to give plenty of reassurance that she is not the first mother to feel the same way.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Mother-partner relationships</h3>
                        <p>A mother who has had twins or more will inevitably turn to her partner for help with the care of the babies, and many families work well together in the care and upbringing of their children, despite the added strains and stresses a multiple birth puts on a family. In some cases her partner may feel that she is devoting too much time to the babies and not enough to him, thus making him feel excluded, especially if when he comes home from work she is too exhausted to take any interest in him. The strain on any relationship when a new baby is born can be quite difficult for the couple to adjust to, but with a multiple birth it is even worse. The midwife should always encourage the partner to be involved in the daily care of the babies, either in hospital or at home.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Care of the mother</h3>
                        <p>Involution of the uterus will be slower because of its increased bulk. 'After pains' may be more troublesome and analgesia should be offered. A good diet is essential and if the mother is breastfeeding she requires a high protein, high calorie diet. It is quite common for breastfeeding mothers to feel hungry between meals and they should be encouraged to keep sensible snacks to hand for such times. A dietician may be able to offer help. The physiotherapist or midwife should instruct the mother in her postnatal exercises.</p>
                        <p>The midwife must give the mother of twins extra support. Teaching her simple parenting skills and encouraging her to carry them out with increasing assurance will build up her confidence.</p>
                        <p>The mother may feel 'in the way' if her babies are in a NICU and require a lot of intensive care. She may have feelings of guilt because of their prematurity and feel it was something she did or did not do that caused them to be born early. She should be given the opportunity to talk her feelings through. On the NICU she should always be kept up to date with the care and condition of her infants. Most NICUs now have a named nurse caring for each baby so parents know who to talk to. If one infant is very ill or dies, the parents will experience additional psychological problems. Some NICUs have psychologists as part of the team and parents can be referred to them.</p>
                        <p>Most units have a rooming-in policy so mothers can stay in the hospital with their babies for two or three nights before they are transferred home, to give them a chance to take over their total care and prepare them for coping at home.</p>
                        <p>Best practice is that twins or more should all be transferred home together from the NICU but this is not always possible. If they go home at different intervals, greater demands are placed on the mother, as she has to care for one baby at home and still visit the sick baby in hospital.</p>
                        <p>It is advisable for a mother of twins to organize help at home for the first 3-4 weeks after transfer. Initially, this may be in the form of her partner taking time off work. If relations or friends have offered to help, the mother should be sure to let them know what kind of help she is expecting from them before it is needed. If the parents are fortunate enough to be able to afford paid help, then they can say exactly what it is they expect to be done. There is no statutory help available for twins or triplets in England and Wales.</p>
                        <p>The community midwife will contact the mother after transfer home from hospital to arrange visits. The health visitor will also arrange to see the mother and her babies after the community midwife has transferred care to the health visitor.</p>
                        <p>At home the mother must be encouraged to rest and catch up on her sleep especially during the day, and eat a well-balanced diet. A good routine is the only way of coping with new babies and all mothers should be encouraged to establish one as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>It may be wise to discourage visitors in the first week at home while the mother adjusts to the new circumstances. Her partner should be encouraged to help as much as possible.</p>
                        <p>Isolation can be a real problem for new mothers. The thought of getting two babies ready to go out can be quite fearful. Studies have shown the incidence of postnatal depression to be significantly higher in mothers of twins (Thorpe et al 1991). Stress, isolation and exhaustion are all significant precipitants of depression (Chapter 25); mothers of twins are therefore more vulnerable.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Development of twins</h3>
                        <p>Twins in most respects will do as well as a single baby, but the one area they can fall behind is language development. With twins, the mother tends to talk to both of them together, so there is less one-to-one communication. Inevitably, she will be much busier and the temptation to leave the twins to amuse themselves is much greater. Talking to each other, the twins act as each other's role model for language (unlike the singleton baby, who has his or her mother). If one child speaks a word incorrectly the twin will copy it, reinforcing the mistake. This is how the so-called 'secret language' of twins develops, otherwise known as 'cryptophasia' or 'idioglossia'. It is essential that each twin is spoken to individually as much as possible. Eye contact is vital in any relationship but especially for language development. If one twin is more responsive and makes eye contact more easily than the other, the mother may respond much more readily to this twin without realizing it.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Identity and individuality</h4>
                        <p>Parents of twins should be encouraged to think of their children as individuals. The distinction between twins can start in the postnatal ward with differently coloured blankets, or different small soft toys. As they grow up, dressing them in different style of clothes, giving them different hairstyles can make children individual. People should be encouraged to refer to the children by name, or 'the girls' or 'boys' and not 'the twins'. At birthdays or Christmas, separate cards and different presents help to retain individuality. The twins should be given the opportunity to spend time apart.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Siblings of multiples</h4>
                        <p>An elder brother or sister of twins may find their arrival very difficult, especially if they have had a number of years of undivided parental attention. Parents must be alert to the feelings of their other children and include them as much as possible in all activities with the twins. A single older sibling may see the parents as a pair, the twins as a pair, while he or she feels isolated. It can be very helpful to find a 'special friend' for the older child, for instance a godparent, or other friend. A good idea is for the parents to arrange not only for the twins to have a present for the older child but for the older child to choose a present for each of the twins. Two different small cuddly toys as the first presents the twins receive can become very special gifts.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The increasing number of surviving triplets and higher order births (Fig. 14.7) will produce many more families needing special advice and support from healthcare workers. In the 1980s the UK Triplet Study (Botting et al 1990) revealed the problems these families face are even greater than were previously realized.</p>
                        <p>A woman expecting three or more babies is at risk of all the same complications as one expecting twins, but magnified. She is more likely to have a period in hospital resting before the triplets' birth and they will almost certainly be born preterm. Perinatal mortality rates are higher for triplets than twins and the incidence of cerebral palsy is also increased (Pharoah et al 2002; CMACE 2011).</p>
                        <p>Triplets or more are almost always born by CS. The midwives must be prepared to receive several small babies within a very short time span. It is essential the paediatric team be present as specialist care may be required. The dangers associated with these births are asphyxia, intracranial injury and perinatal death.</p>
                        <p>The main difficulties these families experience are insufficient practical and financial help and the lack of awareness of their problems by professionals. The emotional stress and anxiety of the birth, having babies in the NICU and the worries of coping with the babies when they go home will seem overwhelming if no arrangements for extra help have been made before the babies are born. A mother should never be expected to manage by herself. Taking triplets out for a walk or any expedition can need major organization, even without the parents having to cope with uninvited comments from passers-by. Some of these can be insensitive and hurtful, making inferences about fertility and the parents bringing extra work on themselves.</p>
                        <p>The midwife must ensure that the mother's health visitor and, if necessary, a social worker are involved in her care. If the family needs extra outside help, this must be organized before the babies are born. Applications to the council for rehousing may also be needed.</p>

                        <p>Perinatal mortality and long-term morbidity are both more common among multiple births than singletons. The perinatal mortality rate for twins is about four times that of singletons, and for triplets, 12 times (Figs 14.8, 14.9).</p>
                        <p>The grief of parents following the death of one of a multiple set is often underestimated. The specific problems they face are not understood and their needs poorly met. It often feels 'easier' to concentrate on the survivor(s), thus denying the parents essential time and space to grieve. All too often people say that they are lucky because they still have one healthy child (or more). No one ever says that to parents who lose one of their two or three singleton children (Bryan 1986). The conflicting emotions the parents will feel and the need to grieve for the child who has died, while wanting to rejoice at the birth of the healthy twin, can be confusing. Birthdays and anniversaries and the constant presence of the survivor(s) are all reminders of the dead child. The parents may need help in relating to the survivor(s). Addresses of organizations that offer support should be made available to the parents. Where one or more of a multiple set has a disability it is often the healthy child who needs additional special attention. He or she may feel guilt that it was something they did that caused the twin's disability and may be resentful of the attention the other one needs, or of the loss of twinship. Any of these may lead to emotional and behavioral problems if not addressed early on.</p>

                        <p>This is the reduction of an apparently healthy higherorder multiple pregnancy down to two or even one embryo so the chances of survival are much higher. It may be offered to parents who have conceived triplets or more, whether spontaneously or as a result of assisted reproduction.</p>
                        <p>The procedure is usually carried out between the 10th and 12th week of the pregnancy. Various techniques may be used, either inserting a needle under ultrasound guidance via the vagina or, more commonly, through the abdominal wall into the fetal thorax. Potassium chloride is usually used, although some doctors prefer saline. Whichever technique is used, all embryos remain in the uterus until birth. Usually the pregnancy is reduced to two embryos, but in some cases to three or even one (Wimalasundera 2006). Any parents who have been offered this treatment must be given counselling, which should include:</p>

The affected fetus is injected as described in MFPR, but this is not usually performed until much later in the pregnancy so allowing the healthy fetus time to grow and develop normally. Counselling must again be offered to the parents. The full impact of either of these procedures and their bereavement will often not be felt until the birth of all their babies (including the dead baby) often many weeks later. Moreover, unlike the termination of a single pregnancy, the parents will be more aware of what could have been as they watch the survivor(s) grow up. When it comes to the labour, midwives must be ready to offer the appropriate care and understanding of the parents' bereavement. The bereavement should be clearly indicated in the notes so it is not forgotten when the mother comes back for her postnatal check and for future pregnancies.</p>

                        <p>In the UK, there is at present no statutory obligation to provide any extra help for families with twins, triplets or more. The support provided by social services varies greatly so it is always advisable for families with triplets to apply. Healthcare workers should be prepared to write letters supporting any applications these families have made. In the UK child benefit is paid to all children whose parents have an individual income of less than £50,000. The firstborn child receives a higher allowance than subsequent children. In multiple pregnancies, it is only the firstborn child that receives the higher allowance.</p>
                        <p>Parents should be advised to contact organizations such as Home Start (see Useful Websites), or local colleges with nursery training courses, both of which may be able to offer assistance.</p>
