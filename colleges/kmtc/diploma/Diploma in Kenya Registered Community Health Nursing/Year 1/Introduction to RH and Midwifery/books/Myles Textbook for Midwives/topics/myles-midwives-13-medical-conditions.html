                        <p>Medical disorders are of increasing significance in midwifery practice. A few years ago a student midwife would have learnt about a few of them during education and training, but this situation is changing. Increasing maternal age and advances in medical treatment have resulted in women who might have previously died, or been advised against pregnancy, now presenting for maternity care and bringing considerable challenges along with them (CMACE 2011). In addition to using this chapter as a resource, a midwife caring for such women may need to seek additional sources for advancing her knowledge as not every medical condition or infection could be fully explored within this chapter.</p>

                        <h3>Blood pressure - regulation and measurement</h3>
                        <p>Blood pressure ( BP ) is the force exerted by blood volume on the blood vessel walls, known as peripheral resistance. This force is generated by contraction of the ventricles of the heart, and in the case of young, healthy adults blood enters the aorta at 120 mmHg at systole (contraction) and falls to 80 mmHg at diastole (relaxation) (Tortora and Derrickson 2010). As the blood is dispersed through the arterial system the pressure gradually lowers to 16 mmHg by the time it reaches the capillaries. Blood pressure is never zero unless there is a cardiac arrest (Webster et al 2013).</p>
                        <p>When cardiac output rises due to increased stroke volume or heart rate the BP rises, providing peripheral resistance remains constant, and BP lowers with a decrease in cardiac output. Haemorrhage lowers blood volume and cardiac output so the blood pressure will fall; conversely it will rise due to fluid retention increasing blood volume (Tortora and Derrickson 2010). Systolic pressure is relatively labile, and can be affected by emotional mood and body posture. BP rises with age as the arteries become thicker and harder and is exacerbated by conditions such as atherosclerosis.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Regulation of blood pressure</h4>
                        <p>Blood pressure is regulated by neural, chemical and hormonal controls of which the midwife needs a basic knowledge because drugs to control BP often act on these pathways.</p>
                        <p>Baroreceptors are specialized nerve endings in the left ventricle, carotid sinus, aortic arch and pulmonary veins that act as stretch receptors. Increased pressure in these vessels stimulates the baroreceptors to relay this information to the cardiovascular centre of medulla oblongata in the brain. The cardiovascular centre responds by putting out parasympathetic impulses via the motor (efferent) fibres of the vagus nerve supplying the heart, causing fewer sympathetic impulses reaching the heart. This causes a lowered heart rate, lowered cardiac output and vasodilatation of arterioles giving rise to a fall in BP (Tortora and Derrickson 2010). Conversely, if pressure on the baroreceptors decreases, the feedback to the cardiovascular centre results in increased sympathetic impulses causing accelerated heart rate, increased force of contraction and vasodilatation. BP then rises.</p>
                        <p>Chemoreceptors monitor blood chemicals, in particular hydrogen ions, oxygen and carbon dioxide, and are situated close to the baroreceptors. They also relay information to the cardiovascular centre of the medulla oblongata (Tortora and Derrickson 2010). If there is a deficiency of oxygen (hypoxia) the carbon dioxide level rises and hydrogen ion concentration increases causing acidity, such that the chemoreceptors are stimulated and send responses to the medulla oblongata. In response the cardiovascular centre increases sympathetic nerve stimulation causing vasoconstriction of arterioles and veins, and BP rises.</p>
                        <p>Certain hormones influence blood pressure as follows (Tortora and Derrickson 2010):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla increase heart rate and raise BP.</li>
                            <li>Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) released from the posterior pituitary gland causes vasoconstriction especially if there is hypovolaemia due to haemorrhage. Alcohol inhibits release of ADH leading to vasodilatation, which lowers BP.</li>
                            <li>Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction and stimulates secretion of aldosterone resulting in greater reabsorption of water by the kidneys, both resulting in raised BP.</li>
                            <li>Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) from cells in the heart's atria causes vasodilatation, and lowers BP.</li>
                            <li>Histamine released by mast cells in an inflammatory response is a vasodilator, decreasing BP.</li>
                            <li>Progesterone of pregnancy causes vasodilatation and lowers BP (see below).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Blood pressure adaptation in pregnancy</h4>
                        <p>In pregnancy blood plasma volume increases from approximately 2600 ml to 3800 ml by 32 weeks’ gestation and red cell mass from 1400 to 1800 ml ; consequently cardiac output increases by 40%, with the majority of the extra output directed to the uterus and kidneys (Greer et al 2007). This should result in raised BP, however the increasing release of progesterone throughout pregnancy causes vasodilatation, and systolic and diastolic pressures actually fall in the first and second trimesters by about 10 mmHg (Burrow et al 2004), which can predispose the pregnant woman to fainting due to hypotension (see Chapter 9). Systolic and diastolic measurements rise slowly to the pre-pregnancy levels in the third trimester (Redman et al 2010).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Measuring blood pressure</h4>
                        <p>Accurate measurement of BP is essential in order to confirm wellness or to diagnose hypotension or hypertension at the earliest possibility. Traditionally blood pressure was measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer and stethoscope, but human errors in these readings resulted in greater use of manual (usually anaeroid) and digital devices (Waugh and Smith 2012), as well as health and safety concerns about mercury devices. Diastolic BP is now determined at Korotkoff Phase V (disappearance of sound) rather than Korotkoff Phase IV (muffling sound) when using manual devices. Box 13.1 outlines recommendations for measuring BP pressure.</p>
                        <p>The size of cuff is an important consideration as a cuff, and the bladder inside it, that are too small will undercuff the woman with risk of overestimating the blood pressure. About 25% of antenatal women could fall into this category, so both standard and large size cuffs should be available in all maternity clinics and wards (Waugh and Smith 2012).</p>
                        <p>A difference in systolic BP readings between left and right arms of >10 mmHg can be observed in general populations, including healthy women in the antenatal period, and is considered normal (Clarke et al 2012). If hypertension is suspected, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (2011) recommends measuring BP in both arms and if the difference is ≥ 20 mmHg the measurements should be repeated. If the ≥ 20 mmHg difference remains, all subsequent readings should be measured in the arm with the higher reading and the midwife should bring this difference to the attention of a doctor (Nursing and Midwifery Council 2012).</p>

                        <h4>Defining hypertension</h4>
                        <p>Hypertension is systolic or diastolic BP that is raised from normal values. New guidelines recommend that a diagnosis of hypertension should be confirmed using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) as gold standard rather than be based solely on measurements of BP taken in clinical situations (NICE 2011). Definitions applied to the general, non-pregnant, population are outlined in Box 13.2.</p>
                        <p>Hypertension in pregnant women should be taken seriously; lower parameters of BP measurement apply and the definitions in Box 13.3 are used in midwifery and obstetric practice.</p>

                        <h3>Hypertensive conditions of pregnancy</h3>
                        <p>Over the years there have many classifications of hypertension in pregnancy and in particular the competing definitions of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) have caused confusion. The midwife is therefore advised to use the definitions in Box 13.3. The following will attempt to clarify how the conditions present and develop into the next stage, with inherent complications.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Chronic hypertension</h4>
                        <p>Chronic hypertension encompasses hypertension >140/90 mmHg that existed before pregnancy (NICE 2010a). This was previously known as benign or essential hypertension. The earlier that hypertension is diagnosed in pregnancy the more likely it is to be pre-existing chronic hypertension (Webster et al 2013). Lack of illness symptoms implies the woman is unlikely to have had her BP measured pre-pregnancy and potentially it is diagnosed for the first time once she is pregnant.</p>
                        <p>Chronic hypertension has many associated factors, especially: obesity, black race, family history of hypertension and lifestyle factors such as lack of exercise, alcohol consumption and poor diet with high salt or fat intake. The risk of developing chronic hypertension increases with age and it can be primary or secondary in aetiology (NICE 2010a). If this condition is known pre-pregnancy, the women should be directed to pre-conception care. This is to ascertain the extent of the hypertension, treat the causes and assess co-morbidities such as renal impairment or diabetes mellitus where the BP may be lower than with hypertension alone, as the risk of cardiovascular disease is greater (Webster et al 2013). Current medication should be reviewed as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) increase the risk of congenital malformations (Waugh and Smith 2012) and safer alternatives might need to be prescribed (see Box 13.4).</p>

                        <h4>Gestational hypertension</h4>
                        <p>Gestational hypertension is hypertension >140/90 mmHg that presents after the 20th week of pregnancy and without significant proteinuria. The BP should return to normal values postnatally. It can be difficult to differentiate between the presentation of chronic hypertension and gestational hypertension, because the physiological fall in BP in the first trimester of pregnancy occurs with both normotensive and hypertensive women, and can mask the existence of chronic hypertension unless pre-pregnancy values are known (Webster et al 2013). The diagnosis of gestational versus chronic hypertension might be resolved only in retrospect when the six-week postnatal BP readings are performed.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Complications</h5>
                        <p>According to Waugh and Smith (2012) and Webster et al (2013), the complications of gestational hypertension and chronic hypertension are the same:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>intrauterine fetal growth restriction (IUGR)</li>
                            <li>placental abruption</li>
                            <li>superimposed pre-eclampsia</li>
                            <li>worsening hypertension leading to severe hypertension and risks of stroke (cerebral vascular accident [CVA] and organ damage).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Management</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The woman with known chronic hypertension should be booked at a consultant unit, and re-referred to any clinics treating her hypertension and co-existing conditions. If she is taking ACE inhibitors or ARB these are discontinued and alternative hypertensive therapy prescribed (see Box 13.4).</li>
                            <li>The physiological fall of BP in early pregnancy might entail reducing or even ceasing antihypertensives in the first trimester, and then increasing doses gradually towards term based on BP readings.</li>
                            <li>The woman who has a raised BP without proteinuria presenting during pregnancy is likely to have gestational hypertension and should be referred to a maternal medicine clinic and booked for labour and birth in a consultant-led unit.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Thereafter management of both chronic and gestational hypertension is the same and requires involvement of both doctor and midwife as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Schedule antenatal appointments, as for nulliparae, to see a doctor and midwife at 16, 25, 28, 31, 34, 36, 38 weeks (NICE 2010a).</li>
                            <li>Additional appointments should be arranged for maternal medicine or hypertension clinics if indicated.</li>
                            <li>At each appointment record BP, urinalysis with emphasis on proteinuria, and assess fetal growth by symphysis-fundal height (SFH). Be alert for signs of pre-eclampsia.</li>
                            <li>Review BP readings; adjust drug dosages accordingly, aiming to keep BP ≤ 150/100 mmHg in uncomplicated cases (NICE 2010a).</li>
                            <li>The doctor should prescribe low-dose aspirin ( 75 mg once daily).</li>
                            <li>Arrange ultrasound fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume assessment and umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry between 28 and 30 weeks and between 32 and 34 weeks. If results are normal, these are not repeated unless there is a clinical indication (NICE 2010a).</li>
                            <li>Assess and manage co-existing conditions such as obesity or diabetes mellitus.</li>
                            <li>Advise the woman to keep her dietary intake of sodium low (NICE 2010a).</li>
                            <li>Hospital admission is unlikely with both chronic and gestational hypertension unless the hypertension becomes severe.</li>
                            <li>Labour should be induced at 37 weeks or earlier if BP is uncontrolled, or fetal or antenatal complications develop.</li>
                            <li>Labour will require hourly BP monitoring and administration of hypertensive drugs with dosages adjusted if BP fluctuates.</li>
                            <li>An epidural may be advantageous in labour as this lowers BP.</li>
                            <li>Continuous fetal monitoring is required in labour (NICE 2007).</li>
                            <li>A normal birth by the midwife can be anticipated, and caesarean section should be performed for obstetric reasons only.</li>
                            <li>The length of the second stage of labour should be shortened only if severe hypertension develops.</li>
                            <li>Ergometrine and syntometrine should be avoided for the third stage of labour as these are acute vasoconstrictors. Use oxytocin in preference.</li>
                            <li>Breastfeeding should be encouraged.</li>
                            <li>The midwife should record BP daily in the postpartum period for the first 3 days and then on the 5th day.</li>
                            <li>Postpartum BP should be maintained below 140/90 mmHg and, if necessary, medication adjusted (Waugh and Smith 2012).</li>
                            <li>Prior to transfer home from hospital the woman should be seen by an obstetrician who is likely to stop methyldopa within two days of birth and restart the antihypertensive treatment the woman was taking before she planned the pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>If BP falls below 130/80 mmHg the obstetrician should reduce the hypertensive treatment (NICE 2010a).</li>
                            <li>The midwife should reinforce advice on lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise.</li>
                            <li>The combined oral contraceptive pill might be contraindicated, so referral to a doctor or family planning clinic for specialist advice is essential.</li>
                            <li>The midwife should not discharge the woman from her care if BP levels give concern and other members of the multidisciplinary team may need to be involved.</li>
                            <li>A 2-week postnatal review with the general practitioner (GP) should be arranged where the continued use of antenatal hypertensive treatment should be reviewed.</li>
                            <li>A medical review in combination with the 6-week postnatal review should also be arranged (NICE 2010a).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Superimposed pre-eclampsia</h4>
                        <p>Women with chronic hypertension may develop pre-eclampsia as well, and the signs and symptoms are the same as for pre-eclampsia (see below). In these women the blood pressure profile may be more difficult to interpret as the baseline BP is likely to be higher and exacerbated by the effects of treatment with antihypertensives (Webster et al 2013). Development of significant proteinuria (see Box 13.3) is indicative of pre-eclampsia and often accompanied by fetal growth restriction (Webster et al 2013). Management and treatment are as for pre-eclampsia.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Secondary hypertension</h3>
                        <p>Women may develop secondary hypertension as a complication of either underlying physiology or disease, most commonly caused by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Renal disease, which results in sodium retention by the kidney leading to water retention, an increased blood volume and thereafter hypertension. This may be classified as renal hypertension. Depending upon the nature of the renal disease the early birth of the baby may become necessary to prevent long-term kidney damage (Webster et al 2013).</li>
                            <li>Phaeochromocytoma, an adrenal gland tumour secreting the hormones dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline (see section on regulation of blood pressure).</li>
                            <li>Congenital heart disease, especially if there is constriction of the aorta.</li>
                            <li>Conn's syndrome: an excess of aldosterone hormone causes sodium retention and associated hypokalaemia.</li>
                            <li>Cushing's syndrome: an excess of glucocorticoid hormones.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Management</h4>
                        <p>The management is to address the underlying cause. However, substantive treatment might have to wait until the woman has given birth and then treat the condition as for chronic hypertension.</p>

                        <p>Pre-eclampsia (formerly known as PET: pre-eclamptic toxaemia) is an idiopathic (= cause unknown) condition of pregnancy characterized by proteinuria and hypertension presenting after 20 weeks of pregnancy in a woman who previously had normal blood pressure. The severity can be mild, moderate or severe, and may be pre-eclampsia or eclampsia (see below).</p>
                        <p>Pre-eclampsia occurs in 3% of all pregnancies (Hutcheon et al 2011) and >10% of women will develop this in their first pregnancy (Waugh and Smith 2012) (Box 13.5). Whilst most of these women will have a successful outcome to their pregnancy, some will proceed to multisystem complications. In the latest Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries triennial report into maternal deaths (CMACE 2011), there were a total of 19 women in the United Kingdom (UK) who died as a result of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia (Neilson 2011), with an estimated 500-600 babies dying each year, mainly due to premature birth rather than the condition itself. The probability of a woman developing it in future pregnancies is 16%, rising to 25% in cases of severe pre-eclampsia and, where the woman's baby was born before 28 weeks, this probability rises to 55% (NICE 2011).</p>
                        <p>Pre-eclampsia is commonly known as a disease of theories and the pathophysiology is not fully understood. It is thought that the condition arises from the influence of placental tissue as it can arise in molar pregnancies (gestational trophoblastic disease) where there is placental tissue but no fetal tissue (Waugh and Smith 2012).</p>

                        <h4>Management in pregnancy</h4>
                        <p>Women at risk of pre-eclampsia should be investigated for underlying medical problems and will normally be commenced on aspirin from 12 weeks of pregnancy until the baby is born (see Table 13.1) (Webster et al 2013). Women at high risk have one of the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>hypertensive disease during a previous pregnancy</li>
                            <li>chronic hypertension</li>
                            <li>chronic kidney disease</li>
                            <li>autoimmune disease, especially antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (NICE 2010a).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Early recognition of pre-eclampsia is paramount as the midwife is likely to be the first health professional to notice the clinical signs at an antenatal appointment, and prompt referral to an obstetrician is necessary for investigations, albeit the ultimate responsibility for the diagnosis lies with the doctor. Pre-eclampsia can be recognized by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>blood pressure: systolic >140 mmHg or diastolic >90 mmHg (see Chronic hypertension)</li>
                            <li>proteinuria (see Box 13.6 for principles of assessing proteinuria)</li>
                            <li>oedema - may be detectable on examination. Ankle oedema is a common phenomenon in pregnancy and tends to diminish overnight. More generalized oedema that pits on pressure on the pre-tibial surface, face, hands, abdomen and sacrum, especially if sudden in onset, warrants further investigation. The severity of the oedema increases with the severity of the pre-eclampsia.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The midwife should appreciate that the woman may be feeling well and will need convincing that she requires a hospital referral. Referral should be to a consultant-led unit for investigations that, according to Williams and Craft (2012), are likely to include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Urine sample or 24 hour urine collection to quantify the proteinuria (>300 mg) and determine the ratio of protein to creatinine (>30 mg/mmol).</li>
                            <li>Full blood count to observe for platelet consumption and haemolysis. In pre-eclampsia the haemoglobin concentration may be raised (>120 g/l) due to haemoconcentration.</li>
                            <li>Urea and electrolytes to assess renal dysfunction (raised serum creatinine >90 µmol/l).</li>
                            <li>Liver enzymes to assess liver function and observe for transaminitis.</li>
                            <li>Assessment of fetal wellbeing by ultrasound to monitor growth and volume of amniotic fluid and Doppler velocimetry of the umbilical arteries.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Once pre-eclampsia is diagnosed the woman should be offered hospital admission with an integrated package of care including investigations, assessment of fetal wellbeing and drug therapy, that will alter depending upon the severity of the pre-eclampsia as outlined in Table 13.1. Labetalol is the first-line treatment (unless the woman has asthma) and other antihypertensives such as methyldopa and nifedipine (see Box 13.4) might be offered after considering the side-effect profiles for woman and fetus (NICE 2010a). Popular theories about vitamins being natural remedies for pre-eclampsia have no sound research base (Talaulikar and Manyonda 2011) and a meta-analysis by Basaran et al (2010) actually found vitamins C and E supplementation to be associated with an increased risk of gestational hypertension.</p>
                        <p>Whilst drugs will treat the hypertension, the solution for pre-eclampsia is to expedite the birth of the baby and placenta. Induction of labour will be determined by the obstetrician, and is likely to be at 37 weeks for mild pre-eclampsia 34-36 weeks for moderate pre-eclampsia and at 34 weeks for severe hypertension, following a course of corticosteroids to assist with fetal lung maturity (NICE 2010a; Vijgen et al 2010). Birth should be earlier in the event of uncontrolled blood pressure or fetal or antenatal complications, with caesarean section being undertaken for urgent clinical situations or if the fetus is very preterm (Webster et al 2013), ensuring close liaison with neonatal intensive care and anaesthetist teams (NICE 2010a).</p>

                        <h4>Management in labour</h4>
                        <p>Vigilant care by the midwife is paramount in labour, and whilst this is a high-risk labour the midwife may facilitate the birth of the baby in the absence of obstetric complications. Intrapartum care is similar to that provided to a woman with chronic hypertension and in particular there should be continuous fetal monitoring. An epidural anaesthetic is encouraged after review of the platelet count and continuation of antenatal antihypertensive drugs and blood tests according to previous results and the clinical picture are also warranted (Webster et al 2013). Oxytocin is used to control haemorrhage during the third stage of labour in preference to syntometrine or ergometrine. Blood pressure should be measured hourly, with the midwife being alert for signs of fulminant eclampsia.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Postnatal management</h4>
                        <p>As with chronic hypertension, there should be regular measurement of blood pressure until hypertensive treatment has ceased. Blood pressure should be measured four times a day whilst in hospital, then recorded daily at home until the third day and once between days 3 to 5. On each occasion the midwife should ask the woman about severe headache and epigastric pain (NICE 2010a). Methyldopa is usually discontinued or replaced by another antihypertensive drug. If the BP is ≥ 150/100 mmHg the midwife should refer the woman for medical care, where the dosage of antihypertensives is likely to be increased.</p>
                        <p>The midwife should arrange for the woman to take drugs home before transfer from hospital as she is likely to continue with the antenatal drug regimen until her BP lowers to 130/80 mmHg when the dosage can be adjusted by the medical team. The woman should not be discharged from the midwife’s care until the BP becomes stable and the maternal condition no longer gives any cause for concern. There should be a review of hypertensive treatment by the GP at 2 weeks and an obstetric with specialist review offered between 6 and 8 weeks to assess the hypertension (NICE 2010a).</p>

                        <p>Severe pre-eclampsia encompasses high blood pressure of systole ≥ 160 mmHg or diastole ≥ 110 mmHg on two occasions and significant proteinuria. Modern definitions also include women with moderate hypertension who have at least two of the features below:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>low blood platelet count <100 × 10<sup>6</sup>/l</li>
                            <li>abnormal liver function</li>
                            <li>liver tenderness</li>
                            <li>Haemolysis Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelet count (HELLP) syndrome</li>
                            <li>clonus (intermittent muscular contractions and relaxations)</li>
                            <li>papilloedema</li>
                            <li>epigastric pain</li>
                            <li>vomiting</li>
                            <li>severe headache</li>
                            <li>visual disturbance (flashing light similar to migraine)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This condition, unless treated effectively, can lead to eclampsia with risk of mortality and morbidity. The woman must be admitted to a high-risk obstetric ward for medical treatment to bring her blood pressure under control, reduce the risk of fluid overload and prevent seizures. Oral labetalol or nifedipine may be used but if the BP is >170/110 mmHg, intravenous (IV) labetalol or hydrallazine are given in bolus doses to lower the BP and then as a continuous IV infusion (IVI). Intravenous magnesium sulphate may also be administered as this drug can reduce the chance of an eclamptic seizure by 50%. Fluid restriction and a low salt diet should be initiated and monitored with a fluid balance chart, including regular urinalysis to assess proteinuria. The midwife should also be aware that magnesium toxicity may present with a reduced urine output of <10 ml per hour. The effects on the fetus are as for pre-eclampsia, but there is an 80-fold increased risk of iatrogenic pre-term birth before 33 weeks, IUGR and consequent admission to neonatal intensive care (Hutcheon et al 2011).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Fulminant eclampsia</h4>
                        <p>This is the acute worsening of symptoms, especially headache, epigastric pain and vomiting accompanied by high blood pressure, indicating that severe eclampsia is developing into eclampsia and that a convulsion is imminent. Consequently, emergency intervention is required.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Eclampsia</h4>
                        <p>Eclampsia is a neurological condition associated with preeclampsia, manifesting with tonic-clonic convulsions in pregnancy that cannot be attributed to other conditions such as epilepsy (NICE 2010a; Hutcheon et al 2011). A national study undertaken throughout the UK through the United Kingdom (UK) Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) between February 2005 and February 2006 identified 214 cases, indicating an estimated incidence of 27.5 cases per 100000 births (Knight 2007) compared with a rate of 82 cases per 100000 births in the United States of America (USA) (Hutcheon et al 2011). Rates of eclampsia have actually decreased in the developed world, due to improved antenatal care, timing of birth and use of magnesium sulphate (Knight 2007; Hutcheon et al 2011). However, as Neilson (2011) reports, when combining the UKOSS data and that of the latest CMACE triennial report into maternal deaths (CMACE 2011) the case fatality rate from eclampsia is estimated to be 3.1%.</p>
                        <p>Eclampsia can develop any time from 20 weeks’ gestation up to 6 weeks postpartum and indeed 44% of cases occur postnatally (Shennan and Waugh 2003). The UKOSS data revealed that 63% of women in the UK who had eclampsia did not have established pre-eclampsia and over 20% of women had their first convulsion at home (Knight 2007) and were initially admitted to accident and emergency departments.</p>
                        <p>When a woman has an eclamptic seizure the midwife must summon medical aid immediately, initiate Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) principles and then assist the doctor with treatment as outlined in Box 13.7.</p>

                        <h5>The birth</h5>
                        <p>If eclampsia arises during the antenatal or intrapartum period, the woman is likely to require an emergency caesarean section, so the midwife should prepare her for this type of birth and a potentially preterm baby. An epidural or spinal anaesthesia is preferred to reduce the consequences associated with general anaesthesia. If the woman gives birth vaginally, syntometrine and ergometrine should be avoided to manage the third stage of labour and oxytocin used instead.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Subsequent care</h5>
                        <p>Once the woman's condition is stabilized she should have one-to-one care in either the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or the High Dependency Care Unit (HDCU) attached to the labour ward. The aim of the care is to attain a BP of <150/80 mmHg. The woman will require an electrocardiogram (ECG) for one hour after the loading dose of magnesium sulphate, and this drug is continued by IVI for at least 24 hours. A blood sample to measure serum magnesium should be taken as this drug can reach a toxic level. If the urinary output reduces to <100 ml over 4 hours the magnesium sulphate may be reduced by 50% by the doctor, hence accurate fluid balance recording is essential.</p>
                        <p>Continuous monitoring of the woman's BP is warranted along with hourly monitoring of pulse, respiration, oxygen saturation, urine output and reflexes. Ongoing antihypertensive therapy should be continued and adjusted as determined by the woman's blood pressure readings (Hull and Rucklidge 2009). This monitoring usually continues for 24-48 hours, after which, providing the woman's condition improves, she can be transferred to the postnatal ward for a few more days until the medical team considers her condition is satisfactory for transfer home.</p>
                        <p>The baby is likely to be initially cared for on the neonatal unit and the woman should be taken to see her baby as soon as her condition permits. Breastfeeding is to be encouraged and psychological support given by the midwife and neonatal staff.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-4" class="section-heading">Haemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelets (HELLP) syndrome</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This is a multisystem disorder that can occur on its own or in association with pre-eclampsia. There is activation of the coagulation system causing increased deposits of protein fibrin throughout the body resulting in fragmentation of erythrocytes (Webster et al 2013). Fibrin deposits on blood vessel walls initiate clumping of platelets resulting in blood clots and lowering of the platelet count. These deposits decrease the diameter of the blood vessels, raising blood pressure and reducing the blood flow to organs (Webster et al 2013). The liver is especially affected, with destruction of liver cells leading to abnormal liver function and a distended liver with symptoms of epigastric discomfort.</p>
                        <p>HELLP syndrome presents antenatally in 70% of cases, most usually in the third trimester, and in the postnatal period it occurs in 30% of cases. If HELLP syndrome occurs before 26 weeks it is usually associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) (Pawelec et al 2012). It also complicates 20% of severe pre-eclampsia cases resulting in high maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality rates (Greer et al 2007). Of the 19 maternal deaths reported by Neilson (2011) in the latest CMACE triennial report, there was evidence of HELLP syndrome in eight of these women.</p>
                        <p>The woman will present with non-specific symptoms, often malaise, including nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain. In some cases there may be haematuria or jaundice. If there is pre-eclampsia there will be raised blood pressure and proteinuria. These symptoms are similar to acute fatty liver disease (AFLD) and the blood tests define the diagnosis. Complications can include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>progressive disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)</li>
                            <li>liver haematoma and rupture</li>
                            <li>placental abruption</li>
                            <li>pulmonary oedema and adult respiratory distress</li>
                            <li>pleural effusions</li>
                            <li>renal failure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The main treatment is to expedite the birth of the baby with the management and midwifery care being similar to that for severe pre-eclampsia, with emphasis on the administration of magnesium sulphate to prevent convulsions. The condition usually resolves, however, 2 weeks after the baby's birth.</p>

                        <p>Acute fatty liver disease of pregnancy is a rare and serious condition with uncertain aetiology, and current theory implies it is part of the pre-eclampsia spectrum (Doughty and Waugh 2013). Women with a raised body mass index (BMI), primigravidae and women with a multiple pregnancy appear to be at risk.</p>
                        <p>Five out of the following symptoms denote diagnosis, which usually present after 30 weeks of pregnancy: nausea, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, fever, headache, encephalopathy, pruritus, abdominal pain, tiredness, confusion, jaundice, anorexia, ascites, coagulopathy, hypertension, proteinuria, liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy (James et al 2011).</p>
                        <p>The condition of the woman can deteriorate rapidly, especially liver function, affecting both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The woman must be referred to a specialist hepatologist for further investigation and to exclude alternative diagnoses such as HELLP. Management is to hasten the birth of the baby such that the midwife may need to prepare the woman for a preterm birth. Careful fluid balance is required in labour and vigilant observation, as DIC is a significant risk. Following the birth the woman is likely to be transferred to an ICU/HDCU where her condition should begin to improve after 48 hours (Doughty and Waugh 2013).</p>

                        <h3>Obesity</h3>
                        <p>Obesity is considered to be one of the most significant health concerns affecting society, with significant impact on the maternity services (Modder and Fitzsimons 2010). Individual risk of serious morbidity or mortality is related to increasing weight through the development of disease pathways directly attributable to obesity, e.g. cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, these pathways are unclear as individuals of normal body weight may also develop these conditions.</p>
                        <p>The increasing prevalence of obesity is commonly called an epidemic (World Health Organization [WHO] 2000), although obesity does not resemble an infectious disease; rather, it is used to describe a trend. Using BMI classification, statistics demonstrate 25% of adults over 16 years are obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of which 18.5% are women of childbearing age (Modder and Fitzsimons 2010). These figures rise to almost 60% when those in the overweight category are included with a further 5% of the population having a BMI ≥ 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (Heslehurst et al 2010). In 2007, it was estimated that if this trend continues to rise, by 2050 more than 50% of women will be classed as obese (Foresight 2007). Currently only around 40% of women have a normal BMI.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Classifying size using body mass index (BMI)</h4>
                        <p>Obesity is diagnosed using the BMI classification, implemented over 50 years ago as a measure of fatness, being considered a more robust way of assessing a person's level of body fat than measuring solely height and weight (Gard and Wright 2005). Obesity is defined as a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and can be subdivided into classes I, II and III (see Box 13.8). As a screening tool for fatness, the BMI is considered accurate in 75% of cases at best, failing to account for variations in body fat distributions, muscle and bone density, ethnic variations, gender specifics or age effect.</p>

                        <h4>Distribution of body fat and disease</h4>
                        <p>Distribution of body fat is considered a significant indicator of future ill-health, being suggestive of a disordered glucose tolerance (WHO 2000), which often contributes to medical complications such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. In such conditions, visceral fat (fat retained abdominally) is metabolically more active, contributing to metabolic syndrome which is directly associated with cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (Gluckman and Hanson 2012).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Obesity as a concept</h4>
                        <p>Being obese is not in itself a disease, although, as the level of obesity increases so does the individual risk of developing chronic disease (Gluckman and Hanson 2012). Social scientists would agree that obesity is not a disease, but is a social construct defined as a disease, because it is considered abnormal in current Western culture (de Vries 2007). Obese individuals are consequently subject to significant stigma and discrimination directly attributed to their size and shape, even by healthcare professionals (Nyman et al 2010). This negative attitude probably reflects deeper cultural prejudices that exist towards obesity, reflected in the prevailing ideology of it being caused by the individual. However, the cause of obesity is multifactorial: it is considered a complex interplay of genetics, biology and behaviour on a background of cultural, environmental and social factors, where the individual plays a passive role within an obesogenic society (Foresight 2007).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Obesity demographics</h4>
                        <p>A high incidence of obesity is associated with socioeconomic inequalities. Sellstrom et al (2009) identified increased rates of obesity in poorer societal groups, especially younger age groups. Children born into lower social class families are likely to become obese, although this trend is seen more in women than in men, probably because of the complexity of the role of women in society (Khlat et al 2009).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Pathophysiology of obesity</h4>
                        <p>The main effect obesity has on an individual's health is increasing their risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Obesity, especially central obesity, causes metabolic dysfunction involving primarily lipids and glucose, which eventually results in organ dysfunction within many of the body systems, especially the cardiovascular system. Other risk factors for metabolic syndrome include family history, poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle.</p>
                        <p>Metabolic syndrome is thought to be caused by visceral adipose tissue causing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, known as adipokines, which promote insulin resistance. This causes a systemic inflammatory response, which over time results in microvascular and endothelial dysfunction in all of the body systems. The individual will have atherogenic dyslipidaemia, identified by low high density lipoprotein (HDL), raised triglycerides, hypertension and raised fasting blood glucose levels. As well as insulin resistance, such individuals develop a prothrombotic state with raised fibrinogen and plasminogen-activator-inhibitor levels (Miller and Mitchell 2006).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Nutritional needs in pregnancy</h4>
                        <p>Weight gain is usual at certain times in a female's life, e.g. during infancy, between the ages of 5 and 7 years, adolescence, pregnancy and the menopause (Webb 2008). Maternal overnutrition has permanent effects on a fetus, that is, a higher birth weight tends to result in a higher BMI as an adult (Smith et al 2008). Physiological changes in pregnancy predispose to weight gain, essentially to provide energy for labour and lactation, and this storage is facilitated by the effect that increases in oestrogen, progesterone and human placental lactogen (HPL) have on glucose metabolism (Webb 2008). Women with a raised BMI should be advised and encouraged to lose weight pre-conceptually to optimize pregnancy outcomes (Modder and Fitzsimons 2010).</p>
                        <p>A woman's basal metabolic rate (BMR) increases during pregnancy due to the increased metabolic activity of the maternal and fetal tissues. The increased body weight and the increased maternal cardiovascular, renal and respiratory load also influence a rise in the basal metabolic rate (BMR), but in part this is counterbalanced by a general decrease in activity. The resulting increase in required calorie intake is therefore relatively small; an extra 200 kcal per day are required during the third trimester for most women (NICE 2010b). Weight gain in pregnancy is dependent on factors such as diet, activity and maternal wellbeing (Gardner et al 2011).</p>

                        <h4>Antenatal care</h4>
                        <p>The BMI is routinely calculated at the initial visit with the midwife (booking) and a discussion about the implications of a raised BMI should consequently take place between the midwife and the woman. Depending on local guidelines, women with a raised BMI are often referred to a multiprofessional antenatal clinic, which involves specialist midwives, obstetricians and dieticians (Modder and Fitzsimons 2010). Oteng-Ntim et al (2011) undertook a systematic review, consisting of 1228 women, and found that where lifestyle interventions were introduced for obese and overweight women during pregnancy, the gestational weight gain was reduced, along with a reduction in the prevalence of gestational diabetes. However, the quality of the published studies was mainly poor, so these results must be taken with caution.</p>
                        <p>Obesity is a significant risk factor for maternal mortality (CMACE 2011), with 16 of the women who died in the triennium 2006-2008 having a BMI ranging from ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to >40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The subsequent risk of morbidity associated with childbearing of women who have a raised BMI is outlined in Box 13.9 (Smith et al 2008; Modder and Fitzsimons 2010). However, it is important to note that obesity alone is not associated with poor perinatal outcomes, but that it does increase the risk, which subsequently increases as the BMI increases (Scott-Pillai et al 2013). Women with obesity might find some minor disorders of pregnancy, such as back pain and fatigue, are exacerbated (see Chapter 9).</p>

                        <p>During pregnancy, women who are obese may report a range of psycho-social issues related to their increased BMI. For instance, they may feel disappointed at not being recognized as pregnant until later in pregnancy (Nash 2012a) and worry about their weight gain in pregnancy (Nash 2012b). They may also experience a variety of feelings towards their body image, but generally feel less stigma and discrimination, as weight gain is more socially acceptable while pregnant (Johnson et al 2004).</p>
                        <p>The maternity services need to ensure suitable equipment and staffing levels are available, e.g. suitable beds and chairs, large BP cuffs, sufficient operating department staff in respect of caring for women with obesity (Modder and Fitzsimons 2010). Risk assessments for labour should be undertaken antenatally for each woman, considering moving and handling issues in order to ensure suitable aids are available to assist with movement (Modder and Fitzsimons 2010; Marshall and Brydon 2012). Furthermore, CMACE/Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (Modder and Fitzsimons 2010) endorse that all maternity units should have documented environmental risk assessments regarding the availability of facilities for pregnant women presenting with a BMI of ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at the initial visit.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Intrapartum care</h4>
                        <p>Obesity is a significant risk factor during labour, as detailed in Box 13.10. For women who have a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> it is recommended that the birth should occur in a consultantled environment (Kerrigan and Kingdon 2010). However, these women will benefit from good-quality midwiferyled care to promote optimal outcomes, e.g. encouraging mobility and an upright position. It could also be argued that these women might benefit from birthing in a midwife-led unit/birth centre alongside an obstetric unit. It is recommended by NICE (2007) that individual discussions with women whose BMI is between 30 and 34 kg/m<sup>2</sup> should take place regarding the local birth place options available.</p>
                        <p>It is worth noting that there may be difficulties in assessing maternal and fetal wellbeing during labour, e.g. ensuring a good quality cardiotocograph (CTG) recording, undertaking vaginal examinations and performing manoeuvres in an emergency such as shoulder dystocia (Doughty and Waugh 2013). In addition, there may be difficulties in managing intraoperative complications such as controlling haemorrhage.</p>

                        <p>Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce the weight a woman has gained in pregnancy more effectively than in those women who choose to artificially feed their babies (Baker et al 2008). Obese women are as likely to initiate breastfeeding as women of a normal weight, but tend to breastfeed for a shorter time (Amir and Donath 2007). It is known that obese women have delayed lactogenesis and a lowered response of prolactin to suckling, leading to reduced milk production and premature cessation of breastfeeding. However, the response to prolactin is reduced over time so extended support from midwives skilled at supporting the continuance of breastfeeding is especially important in this group of women (Jevitt et al 2007).</p>
                        <p>Weight gained in pregnancy is difficult to lose postnatally due to a number of factors such as the demands of caring for a new baby, eating irregular meals and an inability to exercise as frequently. This may result in higher rates of obesity in later life (Gardner et al 2011). Women who were obese during pregnancy also exhibit a tendency to retain fat centrally following the baby's birth, which may result in increased morbidity and mortality later in life (Villamor and Cnattingius 2006). However, interpregnancy weight reduction has been shown to improve outcomes in any subsequent pregnancy (Modder and Fitzsimons 2010). Discussions around weight, activity and healthy lifestyle modification behaviours by healthcare professionals during the 6-8 weeks postnatal examination are recommended by NICE (2010b) and the RCOG (2006). If co-morbidities such as gestational diabetes have been diagnosed during pregnancy a glucose tolerance test (GTT) should be undertaken at the postnatal examination and the woman should continue to have annual cardiometabolic screening (Modder and Fitzsimons 2010). The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) has collaborated with Slimming World® to develop strategies to positively influence and improve the health of childbearing women (Avery et al 2010; Pallister et al 2010).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Obstetric cholestasis</h3>
                        <p>Obstetric cholestasis (OC) is also known as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and is a condition specific to pregnancy that denotes a disruption and reduction of bile products by the liver. It is diagnosed by the presence of raised serum bile acids and usually appears after the 28th week gestation, resolving a couple of weeks following the birth of the baby. Obstetric cholestasis manifests as intense itching (pruritus) that mainly affects the soles of the feet, hands and body, becoming worse at night, albeit there is no visible rash. The woman often complains of loss of sleep. Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common and jaundice may occur, with the woman stating that her faecal stools are pale.</p>
                        <p>Treatment is based on the use of topical creams, but medications such as ursodeoxycholic acid and chlorampheniramine may be prescribed. Obstetric cholestasis causes severe liver impairment and increases perinatal morbidity and mortality (Saleh and Abdo 2007). Timing of the birth depends on gestational age and fetal wellbeing, which is monitored through fetal growth and biophysical profiles, fetal movements and CTG. Birth before 38 weeks is usually advocated (RCOG 2011a). There is also an increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) due to coagulation disruption. Oral vitamin K 10 mg is often prescribed to lessen the risk and active management of the third stage of labour is advised. Postnatal care is based on ensuring liver function tests (LFTs) return to normal. Recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy is high, at around 90%.</p>

                        <p>Insulin is a polypeptide hormone produced in the pancreas by the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans. It has a pivotal role in the metabolism of carbohydrate, fat and protein and lowers the level of blood glucose. Conversely, the alpha cells produce the hormone glucagon which increases the blood glucose. In healthy individuals, the blood glucose level regulates the secretion of insulin and glucagon on a negative-feedback principal. Hence if the blood glucose level is high (hyperglycaemia) more insulin is released, whereas if the blood glucose level is low (hypoglycaemia) insulin is inhibited and glucagon is released (Tortora and Derrickson 2010). Excess glucose is stored in the liver where it can be released depending upon metabolic demands. In the longer term, excess glucose is stored as body fat and this is an important issue when considering obesity and also macrosomic babies of mothers with diabetes.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Diabetes mellitus</h3>
                        <p>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder due to deficiency or diminished effectiveness of endogenous insulin affecting 5.5% of the adult population in the UK and is the most common pre-existing medical disorder complicating pregnancy in the UK (NICE 2008; James et al 2011). It is characterized by hyperglycaemia, deranged metabolism and complications mainly affecting blood vessels.</p>
                        <p>The classic presentation, especially in type 1 diabetes, is of weight loss and the occurrence of the three polys: polydipsia (excess thirst), polyuria (excessive, dilute urine production) and polyphagia (excessive hunger) (Tortora and Derrickson 2010). There may also be lethargy, prolonged infection, boils and pruritis vulvae. Conversely, with type 2 diabetes, individuals are often obese with few or no presenting symptoms.</p>
                        <p>A random blood glucose result ≥ 11.1 mmol/l is highly suggestive of diabetes and the diagnosis is confirmed by a fasting blood glucose test. A GTT entails taking a fasting blood sample, giving a 75 g glucose drink and a taking a further blood test 2 hours later to determine the plasma glucose levels. If the plasma level is ≥ 7.0 mmol/l following the fasting test, or ≥ 7.8 mmol/l following the 2-hour test, a diagnoses of diabetes is made by the physician.</p>
                        <p>There are several types of diabetes mellitus, as follows.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Type 1 diabetes (formally insulin-dependent or juvenile onset diabetes)</h4>
                        <p>Type 1 diabetes develops as a result of progressive autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells, most probably initiated by infection, with the result that no, or an inadequate amount of, insulin is produced. Hyperglycaemia occurs leading to glycosuria, dehydration, lipolysis and proteolysis with the classic symptoms listed above. Metabolism of type 1 diabetes mimics starvation. In the absence of insulin the body cells use fatty acids to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). By-products of this process produce organic acids called ketones. As ketones accumulate they lower the pH of the blood making it acidic, known as ketoacidosis (Tortora and Derrickson 2010). This can be detected by the presence of ketones in the urine and the breath smelling of pear drop sweets. If untreated, the ketoacidosis will lead to coma and death.</p>
                        <p>In 85% of cases there is no first-degree family history of the condition; however, if one parent has type 1 diabetes, there is a 2-9% chance of an individual developing it, and if both parents have the condition the risk rises to 30%. Diagnosis is confirmed by raised blood glucose results. Complications include nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy and cataract formation. Microvascular complications arise if there is chronic hyperglycaemia, leading to secondary complications such as atherosclerosis and gangrene of the feet due to sensory neuropathy and ischaemia. For this reason individuals with diabetes are discouraged from walking barefooted and may need referral to a diabetic foot clinic.</p>
                        <p>Treatment is the lifelong administration of insulin, which has to be given by subcutaneous injections two to five times a day. This is usually self-administered. Traditionally animal-derived insulins from beef and pork were used, and from the 1980s human insulin was introduced prior to a genetically modified form known as human analogue. All of these can be short- and long-lasting, as shown in Table 13.2.</p>

                        <p>Treatment is based upon best practice guidelines and is determined for each individual person with diabetes and the specialist diabetes team (NICE 2008; Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network [SIGN] 2010). The blood glucose levels aimed for are in the range of a person without diabetes, which are: preprandial (fasting/before a meal) between 3.5 and 5.9 mmol/l, and one hour postprandial <7.8.00 mmol/l. Insulin dosage is adjusted according to blood glucose levels and the individual needs to test their blood sugar at least twice a day using finger prick tests and reagent strips read against a colour chart, or with a glucose meter (glucometer). In the home setting, urine is also tested for ketones using dipsticks.</p>
                        <p>Hypoglycaemia is a potential problem when insulin therapy is used, as insulin will decrease blood glucose levels. When the level is low, adrenergic symptoms of palpitations, perspiration, tremor and hunger alert the individual to take action and resolve this by eating a meal or taking glycogen sweets or gel (de Valk and Visser 2011). If the blood glucose decreases further the individual is likely to experience neuroglycogenic symptoms of altered behaviour and mood swings (de Valk and Visser 2011). If left untreated, convulsions and loss of consciousness can result, leading to coma and death.</p>
                        <p>Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with loss of consciousness and requires the assistance of another person to administer glucagon intramuscularly as there is a risk of asphyxiation with oral administration. Individuals who have diabetes should always carry glucagon ready-to-use devices with them for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>Where diabetes control cannot be achieved by a traditional basal/bolus regime, individuals with diabetes are increasingly being offered the choice of insulin pump therapy. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps (CSII) are in common use in the USA and the midwife is increasingly likely to encounter them in the UK. The pump controls the constant administration of insulin as a basal dose, in bursts at 3-minute intervals with the individual self-administering a bolus dose via the pump when they consume carbohydrate, or if they need to reduce severely high blood glucose levels. This is not currently a closed loop system, as each individual has to have a good understanding of their own personal carbohydrate to insulin ratios in order to regulate the pump to administer an appropriate bolus dose whenever carbohydrate is consumed and set the pump up to follow their required basal dose profile. There are also some pumps that work in conjunction with a continuous glucose monitoring sensor which is injected into the skin, with a transmitter clipped to the surface. The transmitter sends readings to the pump once every 5 minutes. The pump can be set up to sound an alarm if the readings are outside limits defined by the individual and is particularly useful for diabetics who are susceptible to serious hypoglycaemic episodes while asleep. However, as the individual remains responsible for defining appropriate insulin doses based on the information provided by the sensor, they are still required to perform daily blood glucose and urinary ketones tests which necessitates the mental capacity to cope with the system and calculations.</p>
                        <p>A fully closed loop system, also known as the artificial pancreas which mimics normal pancreatic administration of insulin, has also been developed. As with the CSII there is a pump and a sensor, but there is an additional handheld control device that contains an algorithm to calculate the insulin dose required. This information is transmitted to the pump and the insulin is administered automatically without any intervention from the individual. There is also a suspend insulin command to prevent hypoglycaemic episodes. Results from clinical trials are promising and this treatment may become mainstream in just a few years, with midwives encountering it soon in a research context with childbearing women. Islet cell transplants are now available in the UK for individuals who meet strict criteria, being intended for those unable to recognize severe hypoglycaemia or those who are otherwise healthy renal transplant recipients.</p>
                        <p>Regular attendance at outpatient clinics is necessary to monitor diabetic control. The glycated or glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) test is performed every 2-6 months. This measures the average blood glucose level by analysing the molecule in the haemoglobin in the red blood cell where glucose binds. The higher the HbA1c the poorer is the diabetic control. Treatment aims to keep the HbA1c at <48 mmol/mol (6.5%). However, since 2011, HbA1c has been expressed in mmol/mol to comply with the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) Units.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Type 2 diabetes (formally non-insulin-dependent or maturity onset diabetes)</h4>
                        <p>In type 2 diabetes there is a gradual resistance to the action of insulin in the liver and muscle. This can also be combined with impaired pancreatic beta cell function leading to a relative insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 85% of cases of diabetes and tends to cluster in families. All racial groups are affected but it is six times more common in people of South Asian descent and three times more common among people of African and African-Caribbean origin. Traditionally it was associated with older people but it is increasingly diagnosed in children, young adults and among those with a raised BMI and sedentary lifestyle (Gregory and Todd 2013).</p>
                        <p>The initial treatment is by strict diet to reduce weight and increased physical activity to improve glucose tolerance and control the diabetes. As the condition progresses oral diabetic agents such as metformin become necessary, and eventually insulin treatment might be required. Furthermore, ancillary medication such as ACE inhibitors and statins may be prescribed to prevent cardiovascular complications. Diabetic monitoring is the same as for type I diabetes.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Secondary diabetes</h4>
                        <p>This is a type of diabetes that presents secondary to another medical condition such as pancreatic disease or cystic fibrosis (Dornhorst and Williamson 2012).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY)</h4>
                        <p>In this type of diabetes, there is a genetic defect affecting pancreatic beta cell insulin secretion. Out of all cases presenting, 95% have a first-degree relative affected. However, maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is not associated with obesity and it tends to be diagnosed in the second or third decade of life (Dornhorst and Williamson 2012).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)</h4>
                        <p>This is a form of diabetes that arises in the second or third trimester of pregnancy, affecting up to 5% of all pregnancies, and resolves after the birth of the baby. There is intolerance to glucose which is attributed to increasing levels of placental hormones, in particular HPL and increasing maternal insulin resistance, especially after 20 weeks of gestation (Gregory and Todd 2013). Gestational diabetes is usually asymptomatic and according to Reece et al (2009) it is associated with:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>increasing maternal age</li>
                            <li>family history of type 2 diabetes or GDM</li>
                            <li>certain ethnic groups (Asian, African-Caribbean, Latin American, Middle Eastern)</li>
                            <li>previous unexplained stillbirth</li>
                            <li>previous macrosomia</li>
                            <li>obesity (three-fold risk of GDM)</li>
                            <li>smoking (two-fold risk of GDM: England et al 2004)</li>
                            <li>change in weight between pregnancies: an interpregnancy gain of more than three BMI points doubles the risk of GDM (Villamor and Cnattingius 2006)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Gestational diabetes should resolve shortly after the birth of the baby. The finite diagnosis is therefore made in retrospect as it is not possible during pregnancy to differentiate between GDM and types 1 and 2 diabetes that present for the first time in pregnancy (the latter two of which do not resolve following the baby's birth). It is therefore important that observations and outpatient follow-up appointments are undertaken in the postnatal period. The lifetime risk of developing type 2 diabetes after gestational diabetes is seven-fold (Bellamy et al 2009). The treatment is referral to a dietician with adherence to a diet restricting sugar and fat, encouragement of 30 minutes exercise a day, self-monitoring of blood glucose and insulin therapy if necessary.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Pre-conception care</h4>
                        <p>Pre-conception care is essential for any women with diabetes because of the potential pregnancy complications and four-fold increased risk overall of congenital malformations which are associated with hyperglycaemia. If the HbA1c is >58 mmol/mol (7.5%) at the initial visit to the midwife, this risk increases to nine-fold with a four-fold increase in spontaneous miscarriage (Temple 2011). Hughes et al (2010) therefore argue there is a requirement for formalized pre-conception clinics and midwifery involvement for women who have diabetes as approximately only a third of these women receive any such care from their GP or from a hospital clinic (Temple 2011). This should involve each woman taking a daily dose of 5 mg of folic acid prior to conception (NICE 2008) and having a thorough medical assessment, as existing complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy can deteriorate during pregnancy (Scanlon and Harcombe 2011; Gregory and Todd 2013). Any medication should be reviewed and ACE inhibitors discontinued.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Type 1 diabetes</h5>
                        <p>Insulin might need to be changed and the regimen intensified to obtain optimal control. NovoRapid® is the only insulin licensed for use in pregnancy.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Type 2 diabetes</h5>
                        <p>Pre-conception care is important as some anti-diabetic drugs may be teratogenic to early fetal development. Women with type 2 diabetes may also be on statins and ACE inhibitors, which should be discontinued. Consequently, insulin by subcutaneous injection should be commenced and contraception continued until the woman achieves optimal diabetic control. The BMI should be calculated and, if indicated, weight reduction should be encouraged prior to conception.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Pre-conception management</h5>
                        <p>NICE (2008) advocates the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Aim to maintain HbA1c <43 mmol/l (6.1%) to reduce the risk of congenital malformations.</li>
                            <li>Strongly advise women with HbA1c >86 mmol/l (10%) to avoid pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>Reinforce self-monitoring of blood glucose.</li>
                            <li>Offer HbA1c testing monthly.</li>
                            <li>Offer retinal assessment at the first pre-conception appointment and then annually if no retinopathy is found.</li>
                            <li>Assess nephropathy risk including microalbuminuria estimation and serum creatinine/epidermal growth factor receptor (eGFR). If serum creatinine is ≥ 120 µmol/l, or the eGFR is <45 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, a referral should be made to a nephrologist before contraception is discontinued.</li>
                            <li>Discontinue statins before pregnancy or as soon as pregnancy is confirmed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Antenatal management</h4>
                        <p>The midwife will increasingly encounter women with preexisting diabetes because of the increased prevalence of diabetes in young people. Furthermore, some multigravidae might silently develop type 2 diabetes, conceive their fourth or fifth child and present late for the initial appointment with the midwife due to being familiar with pregnancy, however they are at risk of developing complications associated with hyperglycaemia.</p>
                        <p>Existing medical complications can worsen during pregnancy, or be recognized for the first time. Furthermore, the midwife will care for women when diabetes presents during pregnancy: indeed the midwife is likely to be the first health professional to recognize the altered state of health. If diabetes is identified in the first trimester, then this is likely to be pre-existing diabetes diagnosed for the first time in pregnancy rather than GDM. Complications for the pregnancy encompass:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>pre-eclampsia</li>
                            <li>macrosomic baby, due to hyperglycaemia, with risk of shoulder dystocia</li>
                            <li>IUGR</li>
                            <li>polyhydramnios</li>
                            <li>exacerbation of diabetic complications in the woman, in particular retinopathy and nephropathy</li>
                            <li>risk of iatrogenic preterm birth leading to the baby being admitted to the neonatal unit.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition, the risks to the fetus/baby born to a woman with diabetes are that they are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>five times more likely to be stillborn</li>
                            <li>three times more likely to die in the first few months of life</li>
                            <li>four times more likely to have a major congenital malformation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These risks, however, are substantially reduced if there is good blood glucose control before and after pregnancy. The initial visit to the midwife where a detailed medical history is taken should identify those women with pre-existing diabetes in order for a referral to be made to a specialist endocrine/obstetric clinic. Regular appointments at this clinic are usually at fortnightly intervals, where a multidisciplinary team of obstetrician, physician, dietician and specialist nurse/midwife will provide care. As this will be considered to be a high-risk pregnancy, the woman should not be assigned to low-risk schemes of care. Guidelines from NICE (2008) also recommend diabetes screening should be undertaken with women who present at the first appointment with the following risk factors for developing GDM:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>BMI >30 kg/m<sup>2</sup></li>
                            <li>previous macrosomic baby ≥ 4.5 kg or above</li>
                            <li>previous GDM</li>
                            <li>first-degree relative with diabetes</li>
                            <li>family origin with a high prevalence of diabetes, e.g. South Asian, African-Caribbean and Middle Eastern origin.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Newly diagnosed women will require education in monitoring their blood sugar glucose levels using the necessary equipment and reagent strips, which need prescribing. They will require education in self-administration of insulin and in balancing insulin requirements based on their blood glucose readings. Dietary assessment and advice is essential so that the insulin dose can be adjusted according to a woman's normal eating habits.</p>
                        <p>Medical management should achieve a delicate balance between preventing both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia (de Valk and Visser 2011). Blood glucose target levels in pregnancy are likely to be a fasting blood glucose of between 3.5 and 5.9 mmol/l and one-hour postprandial blood glucose below 7.8 mmol/l (NICE 2008), which may be lower than the woman is used to. Qualitative research has shown that pregnant women are happier if their pre- and postprandial blood glucose levels are between 7 and 10 mmol/l with no hypoglycaemia (Richmond 2009), hence the midwife should stress to the woman the importance of complying with the prescribed levels and give advice to her and her family about recognizing the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia. However, the woman should be informed that her blood glucose levels will change throughout pregnancy due to altered hormone levels and the developing fetus having its own metabolic demands. Consequently, it is important that the woman carries glucose tablets/gel and a ready-to-use intramuscular device at all times in case of hypoglycaemic episodes. In addition, women should be advised that as most hypoglycaemia occurring during weeks 8-16 is attributed to nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, it is important they seek advice if this becomes a significant problem in maintaining diabetic control.</p>
                        <p>Key points to consider relating to the antenatal care of women presenting with/developing diabetes are detailed below:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A supplement of 5 mg folic acid should be taken daily for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy to reduce the risk of congenital malformations in the fetus.</li>
                            <li>Urinalysis should be undertaken at each visit to test for glucose, ketones as well as the protein.</li>
                            <li>Women with type 1 diabetes should be offered ketone testing strips and be advised to test for ketonuria if they have symptoms of hyperglycaemia or become unwell.</li>
                            <li>Blood pressure should be recorded at each visit with the midwife being alert for signs of pre-eclampsia, especially with GDM.</li>
                            <li>Women should be discouraged from fasting, especially for long periods (e.g. as with religious observances).</li>
                            <li>Women should test their blood glucose levels on waking and one hour postprandial after every meal during pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>If taking insulin, women should also test their blood glucose level before going to bed.</li>
                            <li>Women with type 2 diabetes are likely to be commenced on insulin: if taking metformin pre-pregnancy, some centres may decide to continue its use until 32 weeks due to emerging evidence of its safety (Gregory and Todd 2013).</li>
                            <li>An ultrasonic scan is undertaken at 7-9 weeks’ gestation to confirm viability and gestational age, followed by a further scan at 18-20 weeks to assess the four chambers of the fetal heart for any anomalies, estimate liquor volume and to ascertain fetal growth.</li>
                            <li>Monthly scans are undertaken to assess fetal growth and their results recorded, observing for signs of macrosomia (dimensions above the 95th centile for the period of gestation).</li>
                            <li>Weekly tests of fetal wellbeing, including CTG or biophysical profiles, should continue until labour commences or there is an indication to intervene earlier: e.g. induction at 38 weeks or caesarean section.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Intrapartum management</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the labour is preterm, steroids are given to the woman to improve fetal lung maturation and additional insulin may be required.</li>
                            <li>If the fetus is macrosomic, the woman should be informed of the risks and benefits of vaginal birth, induction of labour and caesarean section.</li>
                            <li>Blood glucose levels should be monitored hourly through labour and birth, aiming to maintain them between 4 and 7 mmol/l.</li>
                            <li>For women with type I diabetes an IVI of insulin and dextrose should be commenced from the onset of established labour.</li>
                            <li>For women with type 2 and GDM an IVI of insulin and dextrose should be commenced if blood glucose levels cannot be maintained between 4 and 7 mmol/l.</li>
                            <li>The neonatal team should be alerted that the woman is in labour, should their assistance be required when the baby is born.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Care of the baby at birth</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A paediatrician should be present at the birth if the woman is receiving insulin.</li>
                            <li>The midwife should be alert for signs of respiratory distress, hypoglycaemia, hypothermia, cardiac decompensation and neonatal encephalopathy.</li>
                            <li>A baby should be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) only if a significant complication is apparent.</li>
                            <li>The woman should hold her baby as soon as is practical after the birth and prior to any transfer to the NICU.</li>
                            <li>Blood glucose testing of the baby should be carried out after birth and at intervals according to local protocols.</li>
                            <li>The baby should feed within 30 minutes of birth and then every 2-3 hours until pre-feed blood glucose levels are at least 2 mmol/l. If the blood glucose falls <1.5 mmol/l the paediatrician must be called and admission to the NICU is a possibility. (NB: NICUs tend to set a higher baseline for neonatal hypoglycaemia, so local protocols should be consulted.)</li>
                            <li>Blood glucose levels should be assessed in babies who show signs of hypoglycaemia (abnormal muscle tone, level of consciousness, apnoea or seizures) with referral to the paediatrician, who is likely to treat with IV dextrose.</li>
                            <li>The baby should not be transferred home until at least 24 hours old, is maintaining blood glucose levels and is feeding well.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Postnatal care of the woman with diabetes</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Type 1 diabetes: insulin should be reduced immediately after birth and blood glucose levels monitored with insulin adjusted until the appropriate dose is obtained.</li>
                            <li>The woman should be observed for signs of hypoglycaemia.</li>
                            <li>As placental hormone levels fall, the insulin sensitivity improves, such that the insulin infusion rate is likely to need reducing in the early postnatal period.</li>
                            <li>The woman will usually return to her pre-pregnancy insulin levels, unless she is breastfeeding, when the insulin requirements are reduced by 30% (Gregory and Todd 2013).</li>
                            <li>The woman should be advised that breastfeeding affects glycaemic control and there is the need for continued blood glucose monitoring and insulin adjustment.</li>
                            <li>For Type 2 diabetes: insulin should cease immediately and the doctor should confer with the pharmacist as to which oral diabetic agents the woman may safely take if breastfeeding (otherwise she returns to her pre-pregnancy drug therapy).</li>
                            <li>For GDM: insulin ceases immediately and blood glucose monitoring can stop.</li>
                            <li>A fasting blood glucose test should be undertaken at 6 weeks and if there is a possibility that would indicate another form of diabetes, a GTT should be performed immediately.</li>
                            <li>The woman should be advised of the risk of developing diabetes in future pregnancies and the need for pre-pregnancy screening.</li>
                            <li>The woman should be informed of the importance of using contraception to prevent pregnancies in rapid succession and to seek pre-conception care prior to future pregnancies.</li>
                            <li>A healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, smoking cessation and maintaining a BMI within normal limits should also be emphasized to the woman.</li>
                            <li>A follow-up appointment at 6 weeks with the diabetes team or the local GP is also essential (Gregory and Todd 2013).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Thyroid disease</h3>
                        <p>The thyroid gland is a highly vascular organ that is shaped like a butterfly and is situated at the front of the neck. Its main function is to produce the iodine-rich hormones tri-iodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). These hormones are secreted directly into the blood circulation in response to a negative feedback to the hypothalamus which secretes thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) that stimulate the anterior pituitary gland to secrete thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (Tortora and Derrickson 2010). TSH also initiates the uptake of iodine, which combines with an amino acid called tyrosine which enables synthesis of the thyroid hormones within the thyroid follicles (Dornhorst and Williamson 2012). Once in the blood circulation, 99% of T3 and T4 are bound to thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) with the remaining 1% unbound or free: e.g. fT3 and fT4 (James et al 2011). It is fT3, fT4 and TSH that are measured in thyroid function tests.</p>
                        <p>Excess T4 is converted to the more potent T3 by deionization in the peripheral tissue (Dornhorst and Williamson 2012). Most body tissue has receptors for fT3, and once bound to the tissue, metabolic activities result. The thyroid hormones regulate the metabolic rate throughout all body tissue and influence growth and maturity.</p>
                        <p>In pregnancy, the circulating level of TBG enables increased levels of T3 and T4, so only fT3 and fT4 should be measured by laboratory testing (Dornhorst and Williamson 2012). The fetus cannot synthesize T3 and T4 until the 10th week of pregnancy and is dependent upon maternal thyroid hormones from placental transfer (Dornhorst and Williamson 2012). Normal development of the fetal brain is dependent upon maternally derived T4 which is converted intracellularly to T3 (Girling 2006).</p>
                        <p>Thyroid disease is the second most common cause of endocrine dysfunction in pregnancy and is difficult to recognize as the symptoms mimic pregnancy (Girling 2006; James et al 2011) indicated by Table 13.3. The most common thyroid disorders in pregnancy are hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxocosis), being of considerable significance due to their effect on both the woman and fetus.</p>

                        <h4>Hypothyroidism</h4>
                        <p>This is under-activity of the thyroid gland with absent or low levels of thyroid hormones T3 and T4 due to malfunctioning thyroid tissue, or secondary to pituitary or hypothalamic disease. The most common cause in pregnancy is autoimmune thyroiditis and goitre may or may not be present (Gregory and Todd 2013). Lack of dietary iodine can also cause goitre. Goitre is enlarged thyroid tissue due to infiltration of lymphocytes and increase of fibrous tissue; this condition is also known as Hashimoto's disease.</p>
                        <p>Hypothyroidism is familial and may be associated with other autoimmune disease such as type 1 diabetes (Gregory and Todd 2013). Symptoms include weight gain, intolerance to cold temperature, constipation, alopecia, dry skin, lethargy, hoarse voice, ataxia, bradycardia and cognitive impairment. Menstrual irregularities and infertility are common, because TRH stimulation induces hyperprolactinaemia which prevents ovulation. Not all women have symptoms and consequently the disease might be first recognized during infertility investigations. The most serious complication of untreated hypothyroidism is myxoedema coma which presents with hypothermia, hypoventilation and bradycardia, followed by unconsciousness (Gregory and Todd 2013).</p>
                        <p>Pregnancy complications of hypothyroidism are hypertension and low birth weight and psychomotor retardation in the fetus. Dornhorst and Williamson (2012) raise concern of the low Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of children born to mothers with untreated hypothyroidism and cretinism may result from severe maternal iodine deficiency associated with hypothyroidism (James et al 2011). Preconception care is therefore very important and fT4 and thyroxine levels should be measured and the dose of thyroxine adjusted until TSH reaches normal level (Gregory and Todd 2013).</p>
                        <p>During pregnancy the woman should be reviewed by an endocrinologist to measure fT4 and TSH levels at the outset in order to obtain a baseline measurement (Gregory and Todd 2013). The TSH level rises in pregnancy causing an increased demand for thyroxine and so the dose of therapeutic thyroxine is adjusted, usually increasing by 25-50% (Gregory and Todd 2013). Iron supplements should be taken at a different time to the thyroxine to maximize absorption (James et al 2011). Although a large goitre might cause complications for general anaesthesia (James et al 2011), there are otherwise no specific issues for labour and consequently intrapartum care may be provided by the midwife (Gregory and Todd 2013).</p>
                        <p>Postnatally, the thyroxine dose is reduced to the prepregnancy level and the fT4 and TSH levels should be measured at the 6-week follow-up or postnatal appointment. It is important that the neonatal bloodspot screening test is undertaken as the condition can be familial and thus the midwife should provide support to the parents, who are likely to be anxious (Gregory and Todd 2013). In addition, the woman needs to be observed for signs of thyroiditis and postnatal depression (James et al 2011).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis)</h4>
                        <p>Hyperthyroidism is an overactivity of the thyroid gland that affects 0.2% of pregnant women (James et al 2011). It usually manifests as a clinical syndrome called thyrotoxicosis with signs and symptoms that include weight loss despite having a good appetite, intolerance to heat, sweating, tachycardia with bouncing pulse, insomnia, agitation, tremor, exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeballs due to the tissue behind the eye becoming oedematous and fibrous), diarrhoea and menstrual irregularities (Gregory and Todd 2013). Non-pregnancy treatment is with carbimazole and propylthiouracil, which inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis (Dornhorst and Williamson 2012). Thyroidectomy is reserved for cases where there is excessively large goitre and drug therapy is ineffective. If radioiodine treatment has been used to destroy thyroid tissue to lower the thyroid levels, the woman should be counselled to delay conception for at least four months (James et al 2011).</p>
                        <p>The main complication of hyperthyroidism is the medical emergency of thyroid crisis (or thyroid storm) where there are exaggerated features of thyrotoxicosis with additional hyperpyrexia, cardiac dysrhythmias, congestive cardiac failure, altered mental state and ultimately coma. Goitre may also be present. Hyperthyroidism is treated with IV fluids, hydrocortisone, propranolol, oral iodine, carbimazole and propylthiouracil (Dornhorst and Williamson 2012). If the thyrotoxicosis is autoimmune, with antibodies to the TSH receptor, it is called Graves' disease, which accounts for 95% of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy (James et al 2011). Although the risk of miscarriage increases in early pregnancy, the disease otherwise tends to improve in pregnancy and women may go into remission in the latter half of pregnancy (Gregory and Todd 2013).</p>
                        <p>Care in pregnancy aims to normalize thyroid function and carbimazole and propylthiouracil are the drugs of choice with the dose adjusted after monthly measurements of fT4 and TSH. If the control is poor the fetus is at risk of fetal thyrotoxicosis which may necessitate cordocentesis to measure fetal fT4 and TSH (Gregory and Todd 2013). This is a high-risk pregnancy and the woman should consequently be referred to a specialist obstetric unit. The midwife should ensure monthly measurements of fT4 and TSH are undertaken and organize serial fetal growth ultrasound scans. There should also be regular assessment of the fetal heart rate to detect fetal tachycardia. As a result, continuous fetal heart monitoring during labour is required and the paediatrician should be informed when labour is established (Gregory and Todd 2013).</p>
                        <p>Labour can precipitate thyroid crisis/storm (James et al 2011) so meticulous monitoring and recording of maternal observations and wellbeing is vital. As with hypothyroidism, should goitre be present and is large, there may be complications if general anaesthesia is warranted (James et al 2011).</p>
                        <p>Postnatally, the midwife should be alert for signs of thyrotoxicosis flare in the woman and extend the period of undertaking observations with emphasis on maternal pulse. Propylthiouracil is the drug of choice if the woman chooses to breastfeed her baby. The woman's thyroid hormone levels should also be measured 6 weeks following the baby's birth and the drug dose revised accordingly.</p>
                        <p>When examining the baby, the midwife should be alert for signs of neonatal goitre and thyrotoxicosis, referring promptly to the paediatrician if these are suspected. The baby might require temporary treatment with antithyroid drugs and propanolol necessitating admission to the NICU (Gregory and Todd 2013).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Prolactinoma</h3>
                        <p>The pituitary gland increases in size by 50-70% in pregnancy due to normal lactotroph hyperplasia, which in rare cases causes symptoms in pregnancy (Dornhorst and Williamson 2012). The presence of an adenoma, called a prolactinoma, in the pituitary gland will further increase its size and cause symptoms. This adenoma, or cyst, increases the production of prolactin, which is the hormone that initiates lactation (Gregory and Todd 2013). There are two types of adenoma:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Microadenoma: accounts for 90% of cases in pregnancy. They are <10 mm in diameter and rarely grow significantly, with some regressing spontaneously.</li>
                            <li>Macroadenoma: accounts for 10% of cases in pregnancy. They are ≥ 10 mm in diameter and are more likely to expand and cause symptoms of headache and visual disturbance. Occasionally they may progress to pituitary apoplexy or diabetes insipidus (Dornhorst and Williamson 2012).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>With both types of adenoma there is a risk of infertility and treatment is with dopamine agonists, which cause side-effects of nausea, vomiting, postural hypotension, constipation, nasal congestion and Raynaud's phenomenon. Pre-conception care is important and management depends upon the size of the adenoma which might involve a trial of discontinuing the dopamine agonist or changing to bromocriptine. In some cases, surgery might be attempted prior to conception to reduce the bulk size of the adenoma (Gregory and Todd 2013).</p>
                        <p>Once pregnant, the woman should be referred to a specialist unit as this is a high-risk pregnancy. Antenatal care, however, can be shared with the community midwife and medical/obstetric team. At the initial visit the midwife should take particular note of past surgery and current medication when undertaking the woman's history. At each subsequent visit the woman should be asked about headache and visual symptoms. It is the medical team who will determine the type and dose of dopamine agonist and perform monthly visual perimetry to detect early signs of compression on the optic chiasma (Gregory and Todd 2013). If there are indications of adenoma expansion, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan should be performed urgently and bromocriptine commenced.</p>
                        <p>In most cases the intrapartum care can be facilitated by the midwife, however if the adenoma is expanding the woman is likely to have a preterm induction of labour. The obstetric team may advise an elective instrumental birth to avoid a rise in intracranial pressure during the second stage of labour (Gregory and Todd 2013).</p>
                        <p>In the postnatal period the woman is advised to report any symptoms. An MRI scan might be ordered by the medical team and prolactin levels measured after 3 weeks, by which time the values should have returned to their pre-pregnancy levels. Follow-up appointments should be made with the specialist medical team who will evaluate the symptoms when determining the re-commencement of pre-pregnancy treatment with dopamine agonists. The midwife should consult with the doctor and pharmacist for suitable alternative medication if the woman wishes to breastfeed her baby as dopamine agonists are usually contraindicated. Furthermore, the woman will require specialist contraception advice as oestrogen contained within the oral contraceptive pill might further increase the size of the adenoma and consequently is contraindicated (Gregory and Todd 2013).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The chance of midwives caring for a woman with pre-existing cardiac disease, or developing cardiac disease in pregnancy, has increased over recent years due to many factors, including the increased age of childbearing women and the association it has with co-existing medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, as well as obesity, smoking and previous illicit drug use. Furthermore, improved life expectancy of women born with congenital cardiac disease and increased immigration revealing an increase in rheumatic heart disease adds to the prevalence. However, the majority of pregnancies complicated by maternal cardiac disease are expected to have a favourable outcome for both the woman and fetus.</p>
                        <p>Risk for morbidity and mortality depends on the nature of the cardiac lesion, its affect on the functional capacity of the heart and the development of pregnancy-related complications such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, infection, thrombosis and haemorrhage. Cardiac disease is the commonest cause of maternal death in the UK (Nelson-Piercy 2011), giving a maternal mortality rate of 2.31 per 100000 maternities, with 53 women dying from heart disease associated with or exacerbated by pregnancy in the triennium 2006-2008. Of these, acquired heart disease was the cause of the majority of deaths with sudden adult death syndrome (SADS) and ischaemic heart disease (IMD) being common causes of death in pregnancy. Women with congenital heart disease only accounted for one these deaths.</p>
                        <p>The majority of deaths secondary to cardiac causes occur in women with no previous history. It is vital that a midwife undertakes an accurate history from the woman at the first visit. Should any history of cardiac disease be revealed, a more detailed account should be elicited in order to ensure prompt and appropriate referral to an appropriately skilled and experienced multidisciplinary team, usually in regional centres. These women require an individualized midwifery approach to care to address the psychosocial concerns that may often get subsumed within a medical model of care. The midwife's role involves not only being astute to any deviation that may arise in the course of the woman's pregnancy, but also being supportive of the woman's individual needs as she may have the same pregnancy concerns as any other woman.</p>
                        <p>In a healthy pregnancy the haemodynamic profile alters in order to meet the increasing demands of the developing feto-placental unit. Healthy pregnant women are able to adjust to these physiological changes quite easily; for women with co-existing cardiac disease, however, the added workload can precipitate complications. The three sensitive periods of cardiovascular stress (28-32 weeks of pregnancy, during labour and 12-24 hours postpartum) are the most critical and life threatening for women with cardiac disease (Roberts and Adamson 2013). Understanding the changes in cardiovascular dynamics during pregnancy can support the midwife's recognition of key indicators and when limitations to cardiac function are occurring that require prompt referral (see Chapter 9).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Diagnosis of cardiac disease</h3>
                        <p>Along with the signs and symptoms, physical assessment of functional capacity and laboratory tests can assist with the diagnosis of cardiac disease and determine the type of lesion. These may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>full cardiovascular examination, including personal history and assessment of lifestyle risk factors</li>

                        <h3>Care of women with cardiac disease</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Pre-conception care</h4>
                        <p>Women with a pre-existing cardiac problem should receive pre-conception counselling to inform them of any potential risks that a pregnancy may have on their health and that of their unborn baby in terms of inheriting any congenital malformations. This will enable them to make informed decisions and plan their pregnancy monitoring more carefully to reduce any subsequent morbidity and mortality. The risk of inheriting cardiac disease varies between 3% and 50% depending on the type of maternal heart disease. Children of parents with a cardiovascular condition inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (e.g. Marfan syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or long QT syndrome) have an inheritance risk of 50%, regardless of gender of the affected parent.</p>
                        <p>For a steadily increasing number of genetic defects, genetic screening by chorionic villous biopsy (CVS) can be offered in the 12th week of pregnancy. All women with congenital heart disease should be offered fetal echocardiography between the 19th and 22nd week of pregnancy. Measurement of nuchal fold thickness around the 12th to 13th week of pregnancy is an early screening test for Down syndrome in women over 35 years of age. The sensitivity for the presence of a significant cardiac defect is 40-45%, while the specificity of the method is 99%. The incidence of congenital cardiac disease with normal nuchal fold thickness is 1/1000 (Eleftheriades et al 2012).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Antenatal care</h4>
                        <p>The symptoms of physiological pregnancy can mimic the signs and symptoms of cardiac disease, e.g. dyspnoea on exertion, orthopnoea, palpitations, dizziness, fainting, a bounding pulse, tachycardia, peripheral oedema, distended jugular veins and alterations in heart sounds. Observations and investigations of the woman's health should be undertaken prior to and at the beginning of pregnancy to obtain baseline referral points. Adapted antenatal records that include triggers such as shortness of breath, palpitations, pulse rate and rhythm as well as auscultation of the heart for any murmur and lung fields for signs of pulmonary oedema are useful to prompt the midwife into early detection of subtle increases of any worsening symptoms. These observations should be undertaken alongside the usual antenatal examination, but the midwife also needs to be mindful that women with cardiac disease can also develop other complications such as pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes (RCOG 2011b).</p>
                        <p>There should be frequent assessment of the woman with a multidisciplinary approach involving midwives, obstetricians, cardiologists and anaesthetists. The aim is to maintain a steady haemodynamic state and prevent complications, as well as promote physical and psychological wellbeing. In addition, the fetal wellbeing is assessed by the following means:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ultrasound examination to confirm gestational age and any congenital malformation</li>
                            <li>clinical assessment of fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume and by ultrasound</li>
                            <li>monitoring of the fetal heart rate by CTG</li>
                            <li>measurement of fetal and maternal placental blood flow indices by Doppler ultrasonography.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A care plan for pregnancy, labour and the early postnatal period should be informed by the individual woman's situation with a view to optimizing outcomes for her and her baby. Such a plan should be shared with the woman with copies being available in her own hand-held records and those held at a central point.</p>
                        <p>Potential interventions, such as attending parent education classes, can help in allaying the woman's general anxieties about motherhood alongside the antenatal care received from the midwife. This may involve advice regarding modifying and adjusting physical activity during pregnancy. Some women may need to commence maternity leave earlier than anticipated whereas others may require admission to hospital for rest and close monitoring. In addition, guidance about the constituents of a well-balanced diet with restricted intake of cholesterol, sodium-rich foods and salt should also be provided. Monitoring of weight gain should be undertaken as excess weight gain will place additional strain on the heart. Compliance with taking iron and folic acid supplementation is also important in preventing anaemia.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Antithrombotic therapy</h4>
                        <p>The hypercoagulable state in pregnancy increases the risk of thromboembolic disease in women who have arrhythmias, mitral valve stenosis or who have had mechanical cardiac valve replacements. However, the treatment of women requiring antithrombotic therapy during pregnancy is challenging. Warfarin is commonly used as an antithrombotic, but as it is teratogenic to the developing embryo/fetus and associated with a high fetal loss rate, it is not used in pregnancy. Furthermore, warfarin also predisposes the woman and her fetus to haemorrhage when used in the third trimester. Subcutaneous low molecular weight heparins, such as enoxaparin, are useful for thromboprophylaxis but may not be suitable for women with mechanical heart valves. As a consequence, the advice of a haematologist should be sought. Full-length thromboembolism deterrent (TED) support stockings should be worn if the woman is admitted to hospital for rest and assessment, and should also be worn during labour and in the immediate postnatal period.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Intrapartum care: the first stage of labour</h4>
                        <p>Many women with cardiac disease have an uncomplicated labour but it is good practice that there is effective communication among a dedicated multidisciplinary team of midwife, obstetrician, cardiologist, neonatologist, anaesthetist and the woman and her family to optimize birth outcome. Vaginal birth is preferred unless there is an obstetric indication for caesarean section as haemodynamic stability is greater and there is less chance of postoperative infection and pulmonary complications (RCOG 2011b).</p>
                        <p>Intrapartum care involves monitoring the maternal condition using the Modified Early Obstetric Warning Scoring (MEOWS) system that triggers any deviation in order to prompt timely intervention and maximize maternal and fetal wellbeing (McLean et al 2013). Continuous ECG is recommended in nearly all cases and pulse oximetry may be utilized to assess arterial haemoglobin saturation, which may be reduced in women with cardiac disease owing to disruption of normal gas exchange between the lungs and blood. Fluid balance should be recorded, and use of intravenous fluids may be limited. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended. Continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring is usually recommended (Regitz-Zagrosek et al 2011).</p>
                        
                        <h5>Labour induction</h5>
                        <p>If induction is indicated and the cervix is favourable (using the Bishop score: Chapter 19), artificial rupture of the membranes (ARM) is undertaken with an IVI of oxytocin should contractions not establish. A prolonged induction should be avoided. If the cervix is unfavourable, synthetic prostaglandin is used to soften/ripen it. While there is no absolute contraindication to misoprostol (prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub>) or dinoprostone (prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>), there is a theoretical risk of coronary vasospasm and a low risk of arrhythmias. In addition, dinoprostone has more profound effects on BP than misoprostol and is therefore contraindicated in active cardiovascular disease.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Pain relief</h5>
                        <p>The midwife should assist the woman to use the techniques that she has learned for coping with stress. Nitrous oxide and oxygen (Entonox®) and pethidine are usually considered safe means of intrapartum analgesia for women with cardiac disease, but it is important to review the labour plan with the multidisciplinary team before administration. In some situations, epidural anaesthesia may be the analgesia of choice for its effectiveness in relieving pain and decreasing cardiac output and heart rate (RCOG 2011b). It causes peripheral vasodilatation and decreases venous return, which alleviates pulmonary congestion. Furthermore, an effectively working epidural in situ may eliminate the need for emergency general anaesthesia.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Positioning</h5>
                        <p>Cardiac output is influenced by the position of the woman during labour and consequently those with cardiac disease are particularly sensitive to aortocaval compression by the gravid uterus if adopting the supine position. It is recommended that midwives encourage an upright or left lateral position for women to adopt during labour and birth wherever possible (McLean et al 2013).</p>
                        
                        <h4>The second stage of labour</h4>
                        <p>This should be short without undue exertion on the part of the woman. Prolonged pushing with held breath (the Valsalva manoeuvre) should be discouraged as it can further compromise the health of the woman with cardiac disease. Such a manoeuvre raises the intrathoracic pressure, forces the blood out of the thorax and impedes venous return, resulting in a fall in cardiac output. The midwife should therefore encourage the woman to breathe as normal and follow her natural desire to bear down giving several short pushes during each contraction.</p>
                        <p>An instrumental birth using forceps or ventouse may be undertaken to shorten the second stage of labour. Care should be taken, however, when the woman is in the lithotomy position, where the lower part of the body is higher than the trunk, as this produces a sudden increase in venous return to the heart, which may result in heart failure. A wedge should therefore be used to avoid aortocaval compression (McLean et al 2013).</p>
                        
                        <h4>The third stage of labour</h4>
                        <p>An active third stage of labour is usually advocated with a slow IVI of 2 U/min oxytocin administered after the birth of the placenta to avoid systemic hypotension and prevent haemorrhage (see Chapter 18). Prostaglandin F analogues are useful to treat PPH, unless an increase in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is undesirable. Ergometrine is contraindicated in women with cardiac disease as it can cause vasoconstriction and hypertension (Regitz-Zagrosek et al 2011).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Postnatal care</h4>
                        <p>The first 48 hours following the baby's birth are critical for the woman with significant cardiac disease. The heart must be able to cope with the extra volume of blood (autotransfusion) from the uterine circulation as well as the increased venous return following relief of aortocaval compression of the uterus. Conversely, the total blood volume may be diminished by the amount lost at birth and during the postnatal period. Furthermore, the heart will need to compensate should the blood flow be impaired due to PPH. Close monitoring of haemodynamic changes is required at this time and the midwife should identify early signs of infection, thrombosis or pulmonary oedema. Observation of the condition of the woman's legs, the use of antiembolic stockings and early ambulation are important strategies for the midwife to adopt in order to reduce the risk of thromboembolism.</p>
                        <p>Breastfeeding should be encouraged as cardiac output is not affected by lactation, although drug therapy for specific heart conditions may need to be reviewed for safety during breastfeeding. The midwife is required to provide the woman with support to successfully breastfeed her baby, emphasizing the importance of adequate rest and a dietary intake containing sufficient calories to sustain breastfeeding.</p>
                        <p>It is important that prior to transfer from hospital, the midwife explores the help and support available in the home for when the woman returns home with her baby. Relatives and friends often fulfil this need but community support services should also be considered if necessary. In addition, the midwife should offer appropriate contraceptive advice and the options available to the woman who has cardiac disease, considering their individual risks need to be balanced against the risk of pregnancy (RCOG 2011b).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Congenital heart disease</h3>
                        <p>The most common congenital heart diseases (CHD) found in pregnancy are atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), pulmonary stenosis, aortic stenosis and tetralogy of Fallot. The majority of these lesions should have been surgically corrected in childhood, resulting in a growing population of women with CHD achieving a pregnancy. Uncorrected lesions may cause pulmonary hypertension, cyanosis and severe left ventricular failure and are therefore present a greater risk in achieving successful pregnancy outcome. Congenital heart disease is also associated with increased fetal complications such as fetal loss, IUGR, pre-term birth and an increased risk of fetal CHD (Regitz-Zagrosek et al 2011). Particularly high-risk cardiac conditions for pregnancy include the following.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Eisenmenger's syndrome</h4>
                        <p>A large left-right shunt of blood is apparent usually through a VSD, ASD or PDA, which is still patent. This results in an increase in the pulmonary blood flow, which over time leads to fibrosis and the development of pulmonary hypertension and cyanosis (Regitz-Zagrosek et al 2011). When the right-sided heart pressures exceed left heart pressures, the shunt reverses, with worsening cyanosis. Women with this condition are advised against pregnancy as maternal mortality lies in the region of 30-50%. Risk of prematurity contributes to the high perinatal mortality rate.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Marfan syndrome</h4>
                        <p>This syndrome is caused by an autosomal dominant defect on chromosome 15. It is a connective tissue disease affecting the musculoskeletal system, the cardiovascular system and eyes. The cardiovascular abnormalities are the most life-threatening as the elastic fibres in the media of the blood vessels weaken. Dilatation of the ascending and descending aorta results, followed in some instances by dissection or rupture, or both. Pregnancy poses a significant risk because of the increased stress on the cardiovascular system. There is a 50% chance of a child inheriting Marfan syndrome if one parent is affected. Women who have minimal cardiovascular involvement and normal aortic root dimensions have a better pregnancy outcome. Careful monitoring is required throughout pregnancy, including the use of serial echocardiography to identify progressive aortic root dilatation. Prophylactic antihypertensive therapy using beta-blockers is recommended to reduce blood pressure and the rate of aortic dilatation (Roberts and Adamson 2013). Some individuals with Marfan syndrome also present with dural ectasia which, unless mild, presents an increased risk of a spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak in the case of accidental dural puncture during epidural: consequently, epidural anaesthesia is not usually recommended. Whilst Marfan syndrome is a genetic condition, approximately 15% of cases are as a result of new mutation and thus some individuals remain undiagnosed and do not seek any preconception counselling. Pregnant women with Marfan syndrome should be referred to the specialist team containing a cardiologist for immediate assessment and investigation (RCOG 2011b).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Aortic dissection (acute)</h4>
                        <p>Aortic dissection (acute) may occur in pregnancy in association with severe hypertension (systolic >160 mmHg) due to pre-eclampsia, coarctation of the aorta or connective tissue disease such as Marfan syndrome. The woman typically presents with severe chest or intrascapular pain. Early diagnosis using computed tomography chest scan, MRI or transoesophageal echocardiogram is critical, as maternal mortality is high.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Acquired heart disease</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Rheumatic heart disease</h4>
                        <p>Rheumatic heart disease causes inflammation and scarring of the heart valves and results in valve stenosis, with or without regurgitation. The mitral valve is most often affected with stenosis, occurring in two-thirds of cases. This condition is often diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy, presenting as severe breathlessness and tiredness. It tends to appear in immigrant or refugee women who have not had access to medical care. Most women with valvular heart disease can be treated medically, aiming to reduce the heart's workload.</p>
                        <p>During pregnancy, this involves bed rest, oxygen therapy and the use of cardiac drugs, e.g. diuretics (to reduce the fluid load), digoxin (to reduce and regulate the heart rate) and heparin (to reduce the risk of thromboembolic disease). Women with more severe symptomatic disease may require surgical intervention such as balloon valvuloplasty or valve replacement, although both of these procedures carry a degree of maternal and fetal mortality. Antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended for all women with valvular lesions during labour although it may still be advisable for those who have mechanical valves.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Myocardial infarction and ischaemic heart disease</h4>
                        <p>Myocardial infarction (MI) and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) are an increasing cause of maternal death in the UK. Identifiable risk factors include increasing maternal age, obesity, diabetes, pre-existing hypertension, smoking, family history and poor socioeconomic status. A myocardial infarction is most likely to occur in the third trimester of pregnancy and the peripartum period, when haemodynamic changes are at their optimum creating a higher risk of thrombotic events due to the hypercoagulability induced by hormonal changes. In the immediate postpartum period, spontaneous coronary artery dissection is the most common cause of MI. Typically, women present with ischaemic chest pain in the presence of an abnormal ECG and elevated cardiac enzymes, although these signs and symptoms may be masked during labour and birth (McLean et al 2013). Atypical features include abdominal or epigastric pain and vomiting. Coronary angioplasty is the fine line therapy to improve the patency of blocked arteries (Roberts and Adamson 2013).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Peripartum cardiomyopathy</h4>
                        <p>Peripartum cardiomyopathy is relatively rare but is potentially fatal, with mortality rates ranging from 25% to 50%. A number of these deaths occur shortly after the onset of signs and symptoms. The incidence of this type of cardiac disease varies from 1:300 to 1:4000 pregnancies, with heart failure developing very rapidly in some cases. Predisposing factors to peripartum cardiomyopathy comprise of multigravidae, multiple pregnancies, family history, ethnicity, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, pre-eclampsia, malnutrition, pregnant teenagers or older pregnant women and prolonged use of beta-agonists (Mclean et al 2013).</p>
                        <p>Commonly women have no previous history of heart disease and diagnosis is usually made within a specific period of time between the last month of pregnancy and the first 5 months postpartum. Inflammation and enlargement of the myocardium (cardiomegaly) give rise to left ventricular heart failure and thromboembolic complications. Presenting features include orthopnoea and dyspnoea, chest pain and palpitations, new resurgent murmurs and pulmonary crackles, raised jugular pressure, ankle oedema and fatigue. Treatment involves the use of oxygen, diuretics, and vasodilators to decrease pulmonary congestion and fluid overload, followed by inotropic agents to improve myometrial contractility and anticoagulation therapy. As the cardiomegaly resolves there should be a corresponding improvement in the woman's condition but this process may take up to 6 months and there is a risk of recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy. In some women, left ventricular dysfunction persists and unless a heart transplant is performed mortality can be high (Regitz-Zagrosek et al 2011).</p>

                        <h3>Asthma</h3>
                        <p>Asthma is a chronic disorder of the respiratory system entailing an inflammatory hyper-responsiveness of the airways to certain triggers (see Box 13.12). This causes episodic narrowing, resulting in obstruction of the airways and mucous production (Tortora and Derrickson 2010). Asthma is characterized by intermittent episodes of wheezing and shortness of breath as the individual attempts to inhale and exhale. These symptoms are variable and can be worse at night (Scullion et al 2013). The condition is under-diagnosed in female adolescents (Holmes and Scullion 2011). Key statistics reveal the extent of the problem in the UK:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>corticosteroid inhaler (e.g. betclometasone dipropionate), twice a day: usually colour-coded brown or orange and described as a preventer inhaler</li>
                            <li>bronchodilator inhaler/beta-2 agonist (e.g. salbutamol), when required: colour-coded blue and described as a reliever inhaler.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Further treatment may involve long acting beta-2 agonists, theophyllines, leukotriene antagonists and, in extreme cases, oral corticosteroids (Holmes and Scullion 2011).</p>
                        <p>In pregnancy, women are at increased risk of delivering low birth weight and preterm babies and have a greater tendency to other medical complications such as pre-eclampsia (Scullion et al 2013). They should be advised of the importance of good control of their asthma to avoid problems for themselves and the baby and that medication used to control asthmatic symptoms is generally safe in pregnancy (Scullion et al 2013). These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>short- and long-acting beta-2 agonists</li>
                            <li>inhaled steroids</li>
                            <li>oral theophyllines</li>
                            <li>leukotriene antagonists: if they are already being used, these should continue, but should not be commenced as a new therapy</li>
                            <li>steroid tablets: indicated for severe asthma and exacerbations and should never be withheld because of pregnancy (BTS/SIGN 2011).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition, pregnant women should be encouraged to cease smoking and avoid passive cigarette smoke.</p>
                        <p>Severe acute asthma, also termed status asthmaticus or asthma attack, occurs when there is spasm of the smooth muscle in the walls of the smaller bronchi and bronchioles leading to partial or complete obstruction of the airways, known as bronchoconstriction. This manifests with periods of coughing, wheezing and difficulty with exhalation. Air may become trapped in the alveoli during exhalation. Excessive secretion of mucous may obstruct the bronchioles and worsen the attack. This is a medical emergency and pregnant women should be treated in hospital.</p>
                        <p>High flow oxygen should be administered immediately to maintain saturations between 94 and 98%, a systemic corticosteroid given and inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonists administered via a large volume spacer or nebulizer (BTS/SIGN 2011). If the response is poor, inhaled ipratropium bromide may be given and arrangements made to transfer the woman to the ICU/HDCU for ventilatory support.</p>
                        <p>The labour of a woman whose asthma is well controlled may progress physiologically, supported by the midwife. Those women who have been receiving oral steroids may require hydrocortisone during labour. If anaesthesia is required, epidural is preferable to general anaesthesia. If ergometrine and syntometrine are used to control blood loss following the birth of the placenta, extreme caution should be taken to reduce the risk of inducing bronchoconstriction (BTS/SIGN 2011; Scullion et al 2013). Breastfeeding should be encouraged and the woman should continue to take all prescribed medication for her asthma during lactation.</p>

                        <p>Thromboembolic disease is of considerable importance to midwifery practice because of the associated maternal mortality. Although maternal mortality attributed to thromboembolic disease has declined in the UK over recent years, it remains the third leading cause of direct maternal death with 18 deaths occurring in the last triennial report, 2006-2008 (Drife 2011). The pregnant woman has a ten-fold increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared with the non-pregnant population, which rises to 25-fold in the puerperium (Clark et al 2012).</p>

                        </aside>
                        <p>Most UK NHS Trusts will have a risk assessment based on the criteria in Box 13.13. The midwife should perform and document this risk assessment on the following occasions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>initial meeting with the woman (booking visit)</li>
                            <li>any hospital admission</li>
                            <li>following the birth of the baby.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If this assessment identifies women at risk of developing VTE, the midwife should promptly refer her to a consultant-led maternity unit with an expert in thrombosis in pregnancy (Elliott and Pavord 2013). The woman is likely to be commenced on subcutaneous injections of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), as this does not cross the placental barrier with consequential effects on the fetus. The midwife, or specialist nurse, should educate the woman in self-administration of the heparin, alerting her to carry a medical alert card containing such details with her at all times. The woman should be provided with a sharps bin for safe disposal of the injection devices.</p>
                        <p>Gradient compression stockings or TED stockings are likely to be prescribed. Such stockings are available in two lengths, below the knee or thigh, and are designed to give a pressure gradient from the ankle to the knee or thigh that mimics the pumping action of the deep leg vein calf muscles, with the highest pressure being at the ankle. It is important that the woman is measured correctly around the ankle and calf or thigh circumference depending upon the type of stocking prescribed (Llewelyn 2013). Midwives should be trained in their use to be able to instruct the woman how to wear them correctly and monitor their use (Elliott and Pavord 2013). For hygiene purposes, stockings should be removed daily, but this should be no more than 30 minutes. The legs should be inspected and measured by the midwife every three days to detect any changes in size or tissue damage (Llewelyn 2013).</p>
                        <p>The woman should be given advice about avoiding dehydration, ceasing smoking and eating a healthy diet (Copple and Coser 2013). If the pregnant woman is expecting to travel long distances, especially by air, she will benefit by wearing loose fitting clothing and flight socks (TED stockings), drinking plenty of water, avoiding alcohol and remaining ambulant for as long as possible/ performing leg exercises when at rest (Elliott and Pavord 2013).</p>
                        <p>During labour, the midwife should encourage mobility with regular changes of position and passive leg exercises when the woman is at rest. It is important that hydration is maintained and regular observations are undertaken, including frequent examination of the woman's legs. If the woman has been prescribed LMWH in pregnancy, this should be omitted at the onset of contractions and regional anaesthesia avoided within 12 hours of the last administered dose. There should be active management of the third stage of labour with the oxytoxic drug being administered IV. If perineal suturing is required, the midwife should undertake this promptly to avoid the woman being in the lithotomy position for a prolonged time, as this further increases the risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). If surgery is necessary, intermittent calf compression will be required in theatre.</p>
                        <p>The postnatal period presents further risk to the woman for both DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE), and early mobilization should be encouraged. Routine postnatal observations are important, especially respiration rate and the development of any leg swelling. If either condition is suspected the woman must be referred urgently to a haematologist, or if at home she must be re-admitted to hospital.</p>

                        <p>A blood clot formed within a blood vessel is termed a thrombus, which can become detached and lodge in another blood vessel and partially or wholly occlude it. Virchow's triad (see Fig. 13.1) outlines predisposing factors for thrombus formation (Bagot and Arya 2008).</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>In pregnancy, Virchow's triad is affected by the physiological changes to the haematological system (Greer et al 2007) (see Chapter 9). Despite pregnancy presenting a state of hypervolaemia, by term hypercoagulability also develops to compensate for the demands of the forthcoming labour and maintenance of haemostasis. In addition, there is relative venous stasis with a gradual 50% reduction in venous flow velocity, reaching its peak at 36 weeks and declining to pre-pregnancy values by 6 weeks following the baby's birth (Greer et al 2007). Furthermore, the physical effect of the gravid uterus exerts pressure on the pelvic veins and the inferior vena cava, increasing the woman's risk of developing a DVT in the veins of the calf, thigh and pelvis (Elliott and Pavord 2013).</p>
                        <p>In pregnancy, 90% of DVT occur in the left leg compared with 55% in the non-pregnant woman due to compression of the left iliac vein by the left iliac artery in pregnancy (Clark et al 2012). The ileofemoral veins are the most common location, having 70% of pregnancy occurrences versus 9% in the non-pregnant woman, and are more likely to result in pulmonary embolism (Clark et al 2012).</p>
                        <p>The complications of DVT are pulmonary embolism (PE) and post-thrombotic syndrome arising from damage to the venous valves that result in a backflow of blood, venous hypertension, oedema and tissue hypoxia (Elliott and Pavord 2013). The midwife needs to be aware of the signs of DVT (listed below) as she may be the first person to identify this when undertaking an antenatal or postnatal examination on the woman:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>pain in the area of the clot</li>
                            <li>swelling (usually one-sided)</li>
                            <li>red discoloration</li>
                            <li>difficulty in weight-bearing on the affected leg</li>
                            <li>low grade pyrexia</li>
                            <li>lower abdominal or back pain.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the leg appears swollen a tape measure should be used to assess the circumference of both legs at the affected area for comparison. A DVT is potentially life threatening and the midwife must refer the woman immediately to hospital for medical examination, investigation and treatment (RCOG 2010a). The classic diagnostic use of dorsiflexion of the foot (Homan's sign) is considered unreliable in pregnancy and the presence of severe lower back pain has greater significance (James et al 2011). Medical investigations involve Doppler ultrasound and serum investigations might be performed; however, Elliott and Pavord (2013) debate the usefulness of measuring D-dimers levels in pregnancy. Venography is generally avoided in pregnancy due to the small radiation risk to the fetus.</p>
                        <p>Treatment of DVT in pregnancy is with LMWH administered 12-hourly by subcutaneous injection to sustain the levels, and which should continue for at least 6 months after the diagnosis. Gradient compression stockings should be prescribed and the woman taught how to put them on. The woman will need to wear one on the affected leg for two years to reduce the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome (Elliott and Pavord 2013). Anticoagulation therapy should continue for at least 6 months after the diagnosis (RCOG 2010a).</p>
                        <p>The woman should be seen by the anaesthetist prior to labour to discuss the risks that thromboembolic disorders have on the administration of regional/general anaesthesia. As soon as labour commences, heparin should be omitted and compression stockings should be worn. As regional anaesthesia carries a risk of spinal bleeding, this should be avoided within 12 hours of administration of heparin. Although general anaesthetic is itself a thrombotic risk, it may have to be considered for caesarean section. The woman should be encouraged to remain mobile or undertake passive leg exercises and maintain hydration. An IVI should be sited, and drugs given IV instead of intramuscularly (IM). Prolonged use of the lithotomy position should be avoided, as this is a DVT risk. The third stage of labour should be actively managed with the oxytoxic drug being administered IV to prompt haemostasis. If perineal suturing is required, it should be undertaken promptly to limit the length of time the woman is in the lithotomy position (RCOG 2010a; Elliott and Pavord 2013).</p>
                        <p>The midwife should be aware that there is a 25-fold increased risk of DVT and the potential for PE during the postnatal period. As a consequence, the woman who has had a previous DVT is especially at high risk and thus the midwife is required to be particularly vigilant is assessing her condition, encouraging early ambulation and hydration. Heparin is recommenced as directed by the medical team. This is usually 2 hours after a vaginal birth or longer if the woman had an epidural and/or caesarean section, and should continue until at least the 6-week postnatal appointment, at which point a decision to change to warfarin may be made (RCOG 2010b; Elliott and Pavord 2013). Oestrogen-based contraceptive pills are contraindicated so depo-provera or barrier methods of contraception should be discussed with the woman and her partner.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a DVT detaches and becomes mobile, known as an embolus. A large embolus might lodge in the pulmonary artery and smaller ones can travel distally to small vessels in the lung periphery, where they may wholly or partially occlude the blood vessel (James et al 2011; Elliott and Pavord 2013). Initially the lung tissue is ventilated but not perfused, producing intrapulmonary dead space, and there is impaired gaseous exchange (Kumar and Clarke 2004). After some hours, surfactant production by the affected lung ceases, the alveoli collapse and hypoxaemia results. Pulmonary arterial pressure rises and there is a reduction in cardiac output. The area of the lung affected by the embolism may become infracted; however, in some instances, oxygenation of tissue continues to some extent from the bronchial circulation and airways (Kumar and Clarke 2004).</p>
                        <p>In the case of a small embolism, there is likely to be dyspnoea, discomfort or pain in the chest, haemoptysis and low grade pyrexia, all of which can be misdiagnosed as a chest infection. Cardiovascular examination is usually normal (Kumar and Clarke 2004; James et al 2011).</p>
                        <p>A larger embolism that occludes a major vessel will result in a more acute presentation, because of sudden obstruction of the right ventricle and its outflow (Kumar and Clarke 2004). There is severe central chest pain due to ischaemia, and pallor with sweating as shock develops. Tachycardia occurs and a gallop rhythm of the heart may be heard on examination. Hypotension develops as peripheral shutdown occurs. Syncope may result when cardiac output is suddenly reduced (Kumar and Clarke 2004). Admission to an intensive care unit is highly likely as there is a significant risk of death if treatment is delayed.</p>
                        <p>Pulmonary embolism is a medical emergency and urgent referral to hospital is indicated. Diagnosis is made from a combination of clinical probability score and radiological imaging. Heparin, usually LWMH, is commenced at presentation with subsequent anticoagulation treatment and management in labour and the postnatal period being similar to that for a woman presenting with DVT (Elliott and Pavord 2013).</p>

                        <p>In DIC (also known as disseminated intravascular coagulopathy), damage to the endothelium (lining of blood vessel walls) arising from pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, major haemorrhage, embolism, intrauterine fetal death or retained placenta results in thromboplastins being released from the damaged cells, causing the extrinsic pathway to mount a coagulation cascade. Blood clotting occurs at the original site and then small clots (micro-thrombi) disperse throughout the rest of the vascular system. Large quantities of fibrinogen, thrombocytes (platelets) and clotting factors V and VIII are consumed. The micro-thrombi produced can occlude small blood vessels, resulting in ischaemia, hence some organ tissue dies and releases more thromboplastins and the cycle re-commences. All clotting factors and platelets are subsequently consumed and bleeding results. There is simultaneously widespread blood clotting and a clotting deficiency. Bleeding occurs, petechiae develop in the skin and, if untreated, major haemorrhage can result (Kumar and Clarke 2004; Craig et al 2006).</p>

                        <p>Anaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or their oxygen-carrying capacity is insufficient to meet the physiological needs of the individual, which consequently will vary by age, sex, altitude, smoking and pregnancy status (WHO 2013). In its severe form, it is associated with fatigue, weakness, dizziness and drowsiness, pregnant women and children being particularly vulnerable (WHO 2013). Anaemia in pregnancy is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration of less than 11 g/dl (James et al 2011).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Physiological anaemia of pregnancy</h4>
                        <p>The increase of blood plasma in pregnancy causes a state of haemodilution (see Chapter 9). On laboratory testing, the Hb values decline, reaching the lowest in the second trimester followed by a gradual rise in the third trimester. This situation is not pathological unless the Hb reduces to such an extent that iron deficiency anaemia results.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Iron deficiency anaemia</h4>
                        <p>Iron deficiency is thought to be the most common cause of anaemia globally and is defined by trimester, as shown in Table 13.4 (WHO et al 2001; NICE 2013b).</p>

                        <p>The daily iron requirement for a healthy woman is 1.3 mg, which can be acquired through a diet rich in iron and folate. In pregnancy this requirement rises to 3 mg per day, further increasing to 7 mg per day after 32 weeks (Addo et al 2013). Prophylactic antenatal iron supplementation is no longer administered routinely in the UK, unless the woman is at risk of developing iron deficiency anaemia.</p>
                        <p>Iron deficiency is associated with:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>reduced intake of iron due to gastric malabsorption, gastric surgery or dietary deficiency</li>
                            <li>short intervals between pregnancies</li>
                            <li>chronic infection such as malaria or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)</li>
                            <li>chronic blood loss, e.g. menorrhagia or gastric ulcer</li>
                            <li>haemorrhage</li>
                            <li>secondary cause to medical disorders</li>
                            <li>multiple pregnancy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Iron deficiency interferes with body functions, leading to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>tiredness</li>
                            <li>irritability and depression</li>
                            <li>breathlessness</li>
                            <li>poor memory</li>
                            <li>muscle aches</li>
                            <li>palpitations</li>
                            <li>cardiac failure</li>
                            <li>maternal exhaustion in labour</li>
                            <li>poor recovery from blood loss at the birth and during the postnatal period.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Routine serum blood samples should be taken from healthy pregnant women at intervals during the antenatal period according to local protocols for the early identification of anaemia. When anaemia is identified serum ferritin should be measured as an indication of the level of stored iron. It is recommended that women with known anaemia be screened at every antenatal appointment (Addo et al 2013). Borderline anaemia can be managed in the community setting, however severe or chronic cases should be referred to a consultant-led maternity unit as should those women who are symptomatic (Addo et al 2013).</p>
                        <p>The initial treatment is with iron tablets, such as Pregaday®, one tablet per day for 2 weeks. The woman should be advised to take the tablet 1 hour before food with orange juice, which contains ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to aid absorption of the iron. Unfortunately many brands of oral iron tablets have unpleasant gastric side-effects which reduce maternal compliance in taking them. Serum Hb estimation is undertaken after 2 weeks, and if the Hb appears to be rising, the woman should continue taking the iron tablets. However, if the Hb does not rise or there is intolerance or poor compliance, the woman should be referred to a haematology clinic for further management. Additional investigations may be undertaken to determine the cause of the anaemia and other oral iron, such as ferrous sulphate (200 mg 2-3 times daily) may be prescribed. If there is still intolerance to oral iron, then parenteral iron injections will be offered. These injections, however, are uncomfortable and can cause iron staining on the skin, so the z-track injection method should be used. Blood transfusion is used only in extreme cases during pregnancy (Addo et al 2013).</p>
                        <p>If the anaemia persists then the woman should be assessed regarding her risk for haemorrhage. An IVI should be sited in labour and blood samples taken for full blood count (FBC) and for group and save. The FBC results should be reviewed before the woman either eats or drinks. The midwife should be alert for signs of maternal exhaustion during labour with active management of the third stage of labour being undertaken, and all perineal trauma should be sutured to minimize the effects of blood loss at the time of the birth.</p>
                        <p>In the postnatal period the woman with anaemia is at risk of infection, postpartum haemorrhage, depression and poor wound healing. The midwife should observe and support her accordingly and ensure that a FBC blood sample is taken to identify further treatment requirements. Contraceptive advice should be given for adequate spacing of pregnancies along with dietary advice and a follow-up appointment. The FBC will also need repeating at the 6 week postnatal examination.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Folic acid deficiency</h4>
                        <p>Folic acid is part of the vitamin B complex. In pregnancy it is necessary for effective cell growth and synthesis of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) especially the embryo, and a deficiency is associated with neural tube defects in the fetus. Deficiency can be due to multiple pregnancy, poor diet, adverse social circumstances and may arise secondary to drug therapy such as antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The average daily folate requirements rise in pregnancy from 50 to 400 µg/day (Addo et al 2013). Although this can usually be met through a healthy diet, women are encouraged to take prophylactic folic acid 400 µg/day (0.4 mg) routinely in the first trimester, which should be increased to 5 mg if the woman is also taking AEDs or other drugs affecting folate metabolism. Chronic maternal folate deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anaemia (Greer et al 2007).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Megaloblastic anaemia</h4>
                        <p>Megaloblastic anaemia refers to an abnormality of the erythroblasts in the bone marrow in which the maturation of the nucleus is delayed due to defective DNA synthesis resulting in the production of larger than normal red blood cells (macrocytosis). This arises from a deficiency of either of two B vitamins, folic acid and cyanocobalmin (B12), both of which are necessary for DNA synthesis (Kumar and Clark 2004). A deficiency of vitamin B12 alone is termed pernicious anaemia. One third of pregnancies worldwide are affected by megaloblastic anaemia, but the UK incidence is low at 0.5%. Megaloblastic anaemia is secondary to dietary deficiency (especially a vegan diet), alcoholism; gastrointestinal surgery, autoimmune disease, medical disorders, especially sickle cell disease, and drug therapy, e.g. azathioprine (Kumar and Clark 2004; NICE 2013).</p>
                        <p>Diagnosis is made through taking a detailed history from the woman, undertaking a physical examination and investigations including a FBC, blood film and assessing serum concentrations of vitamin B12 and folate. If vitamin B12 deficiency is evident, serum anti-intrinsic factor and antiparietal cell antibodies should be examined. If folate levels are low, tests for anti-endomysial or antitransglutaminase antibodies are likely to be performed (NICE 2013). Treatment is determined according to the identity of the underlying cause. Supplements of folic acid and cyanocobalamin will be prescribed as necessary, and a referral to a dietician may be necessary.</p>
                        <p>The midwife has an important role in identifying at-risk women and referring them to appropriate personnel, encouraging compliance with medication and providing dietary advice.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Haemoglobinopathies</h3>
                        <p>Haemoglobinopathies are a group of inherited conditions with abnormalities of the Hb. Haemoglobin consists of a group of four molecules, each of which as a haem unit made up of an iron porphyrin complex and a protein or globin chain. A total of 97% of adult Hb (HbA) has two α- and two β-chains and the remaining 3% is composed of two α- and two δ-chains. Fetal Hb (HbF) has two α- and two γ-chains, the latter being gradually replaced by the β-chain by around the age of 6 months. The type of globin chain is genetically determined and defective genes lead to the formation of abnormal haemoglobin. This may be as a result of impaired globin synthesis (thalassaemia syndromes) or from structural abnormality of globin (haemoglobin variants such as sickle cell anaemia). Haemoglobinopathies mainly affect people from Africa, West Indies, Asia, the Middle East and the eastern Mediterranean and the theory is that the carrier state offers some protection against malaria (Greer et al 2007).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Thalassaemia</h4>
                        <p>There are different types of thalassaemia depending upon which haemoglobin chain has been affected: α-chains are formed by two genes from each parent whereas β-chains are formed by one gene from each parent. In α-thalassaemia, the production of α-globin is deficient and in β-thalassaemia the production of β-globin is defective. The classifications are:</p>
                        
                        <h5>α-thalassaemia</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Normal: genotype = α/α, α/α.</li>
                            <li>α<sup>+</sup>-thalassaemia heterozygous: genotype = α/-, α/α. One defective α gene. Borderline Hb level and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), low mean corpuscular Hb (MCH): clinically asymptomatic.</li>
                            <li>α<sup>+</sup>-thalassaemia homozygous: genotype = α/-, α/-. Two defective α genes. Slightly anaemic, low MCV and MCH; clinically asymptomatic. This is known as thalassaemia trait and is associated with Africans.</li>
                            <li>α<sup>0</sup>-thalassaemia heterozygous: genotype = α/α, -/-. Two defective α genes. Slightly anaemic, low MCV and MCH; clinically asymptomatic. This is also known as thalassaemia trait and is associated with Asians.</li>
                            <li>Haemoglobin H disease (HbH): genotype = α/-, -/-. Three defective α genes. Mild to moderate anaemia with very low MCV and MCH; splenomegaly and variable bone changes.</li>
                            <li>α-thalassaemia major: genotype = -/-, -/-. Four defective α genes. This type is also known as Hb Bart's. It presents as severe non-immune intrauterine haemolytic anaemia where the fetus has little circulating haemoglobin that is all tetrametric γ-chains. As a result the fetus becomes oedematous: known as hydrops fetalis/Hb Bart's hydrops, which is usually fatal (Addo et al 2013).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>β-thalassaemia</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Normal: genotype = β2, β2.</li>
                            <li>β-thalassaemia trait: genotype = -, β2. One defective β gene is inherited. HbA2 is >4% and the individual presents with mild anaemia, a low MCV and MCH, but is clinically asymptomatic.</li>
                            <li>β-thalassaemia intermedia: genotype = -, β or β+, β+. Both defective β genes are inherited. This type presents with high levels of HbF which can fluctuate, resulting in anaemia upon which symptoms usually develop when the haemoglobin level remains below 7.0 g/dl, a very low MCV and MCH, splenomegaly and variable bone changes. The dependency on blood transfusion to improve an individual's wellbeing is variable.</li>
                            <li>β-thalassaemia major: genotype = -o/-o. In this type, both defective β genes are also inherited, but the Hb is comprised of >90% HbF (untransfused). As a result, the individual presents with severe haemolytic anaemia, a very low MCV and MCH, and hepatosplenomegaly, such that they are chronically dependent on frequent blood transfusions (Addo et al 2013).</li>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Diagnosis is made by identifying those at high risk and performing the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>full blood count that would reveal a low mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH<27 pg) and a low mean cell volume (MCV<75 fl)</li>
                            <li>bone marrow examination would reveal microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells</li>
                            <li>haemoglobin analysis would reveal elevated HbA<sub>2</sub> levels (Addo et al 2013).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Pre-conception care is important and genetic counselling may be required, especially if there is inter-marriage of cousins. There is a 1 in 4 chance of a baby inheriting a major condition if both parents are carriers (see Fig. 13.2).</p>
                        <p>In early pregnancy diagnostic tests are offered to the woman, consisting of DNA analysis of chorionic villi and fetal blood sampling (Addo et al 2013) with termination of pregnancy being discussed should the fetus be adversely affected. Antenatal care should be provided within an obstetric unit where the woman can be assessed within a combined clinic with a haematologist in attendance. The treatment would entail regular assessment of FBC and serum ferritin. Iron is prescribed only if serum ferritin levels are low as there is a risk of iron overload, which may lead to congestive cardiac failure. Consequently, further investigations may be required to assess cardiac function.</p>
                        <p>Folic acid deficiency must be treated and dietary advice given by the midwife (Addo et al 2013).</p>
                        <p>If the woman has thalassaemia major she is at risk of pre-term labour, which might be iatrogenic, as well as both maternal and fetal hypoxia in labour. If the woman has any bone deformities, caesarean section may be necessary. There should be continuous fetal monitoring in labour and strict monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance. Due to the risk of haemorrhage, it would be wise for the midwife to facilitate active management of the third stage of labour.</p>
                        <p>During the postnatal period, the woman should be observed for signs of infection and haemorrhage and any wound should be inspected for signs of poor healing. Furthermore, the anaemia might worsen following the birth if the baby and tiredness could also predispose to depression. The baby will require paediatric assessment prior to transfer home from hospital and any follow-up appointments should be made to monitor growth and development as well as determine the baby's thalassaemia status.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Sickle cell disease</h4>
                        <p>Sickle cell disease refers to a group of disorders arising from defective genes that produce abnormal Hb molecules (HbS). Defective genes produce abnormal haemoglobin α- or β-chains resulting in HbS. There are several variations and those of most significance to the midwife are the homozygous sickle cell anaemia/sickle cell disease (HbSS) and heterozygous sickle cell trait (HbAS).</p>
                        <p>Other variations can be summarized as follows.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sickle cell HbC disease (HbSC): double heterozygote for HbS and HbC with intermediate clinical severity.</li>
                            <li>Sickle cell β°-thalassaemia (HbS/β°): severe double heterozygote for HbS and β°-thalassaemia with no normal β-chains produced. It is almost clinically indistinguishable from sickle cell anaemia.</li>
                            <li>Sickle cell β<sup>+</sup>-thalassaemia (HbS/β<sup>+</sup>): In this type a reduced amount of chains are made resulting in mild-to-moderate anaemia.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) the erythrocytes are fragile, with a short life span of 17 days, compared with 120 days in a healthy individual. The erythrocytes have a characteristic crescent, or sickle, shape which blocks up the capillaries. This predisposes to clot formation in the capillaries. Diagnosis is by Hb electrophoresis, and identification of the abnormal sickle-shaped cells on a blood film. A bone marrow biopsy may also be required. Treatment outside of pregnancy includes the administration of 1 mg/day oral folic acid tablets, prophylactic penicillin, thromboprophylaxis, iron chelation agents and exchange blood transfusion.</p>
                        <p>A sickle cell crisis arises when the sickle cells form clots in the capillaries resulting in deoxygenation, and tissue death as a result of infarction. The crisis presents acutely with severe pain, breathlessness, pallor, fever, joint swelling and pain, and general weakness (Addo et al 2013). The crisis can be triggered, or exacerbated, by infection, cold temperature, dehydration, stress and exercise. Other complications are chronic anaemia, bone marrow suppression, thromboembolic disease, cardiac failure due to chronic hypoxaemia and aplastic anaemia, as well as sudden death (Addo et al 2013).</p>
                        <p>Pre-conception care is important to optimize the health of the woman, during which time the folic acid should be increased to 5 mg/day and iron chelation discontinued 3-6 months prior to conception due to possible teratogenicity (Addo et al 2013). If the woman has pulmonary hypertension, pregnancy is contraindicated due to the 50% maternal mortality risk (Oteng-Ntim et al 2006).</p>
                        <p>In pregnancy the woman's care should be shared between the obstetric and haematology team, with appointments being made for every 2-4 weeks to assess maternal and fetal wellbeing. The woman presenting with sickle cell anaemia is at risk of experiencing a sickle cell crisis secondary to infection, pre-eclampsia, miscarriage, IUGR, stillbirth and possible maternal death. Investigations include FBC, blood group and antibody screen, reticulocyte count, serum ferritin levels, HIV and hepatitis screening (because of history of blood transfusions) renal and liver function tests. Folic acid should be increased to 5 mg/day if not done so pre-conceptually, and iron supplements only given if indicated by serum ferritin results. Antibiotic therapy may need to be continued. In the third trimester serial growth scans should be undertaken (RCOG 2011c; Addo et al 2013).</p>
                        <p>In labour an epidural is recommended for pain relief as opiates should be avoided. Blood should be taken for FBC, group and save. Graduated compression stockings are used to reduce the risk of VTE and the woman should be kept warm and hydrated to prevent any sickle cell crisis from occurring. Oxygen therapy might be required to maintain adequate oxygenation and improve cardiac function. Prophylactic antibiotics may be considered to reduce infection. A prolonged labour should be avoided and active management or caesarean section may be advised depending on the woman's health (RCOG 2011c; Addo et al 2013). Where there is IUGR, continuous fetal monitoring would also be recommended.</p>
                        <p>During the postnatal period, the midwife should be vigilant in her observations as the woman is at increased risk of sickle cell crisis, thromboembolism and postpartum haemorrhage. Prophylactic antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis should continue and early mobilization is encouraged. Four-hourly observations should be undertaken, including respiration rate. The woman should be advised about subsequent pregnancies and the risk they carry in increasing the frequency of crises. It is therefore important that the woman uses appropriate contraception in order to maximize her health as intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs) are relatively contraindicated due to the risk of infection. Neonatal screening of babies must be undertaken by obtaining a capillary or venous sample of blood at birth. Those with a positive result require a follow-up appointment and electrophoresis at 6 weeks, including prophylactic antibiotic cover from 3 months of age (Addo et al 2013).</p>
                        <p>In sickle cell trait (HbAS) the individual is usually asymptomatic. Although the sickle screening test is positive, the blood appears normal. In pregnancy the woman may present with mild anaemia and so 5 mg/day folic acid is recommended to improve erythropoiesis.</p>

                        <h3>Epilepsy</h3>
                        <p>Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by two or more seizures, with a UK prevalence of 9.7 per 1000 (0.97%) and a reduction in life expectancy of 2-10 years. It mainly presents in childhood, although there is a second peak of incidence in older years and women of childbearing age account for 23% of the population affected by epilepsy, with a prevalence in pregnancy of 0.35%.</p>
                        <p>Seizures result from a sudden excess of electricity to the brain disrupting the normal message passing between the cortical neurons (brain cells). The messages become mixed or halted, and a seizure results. These seizures can be subcategorized as partial and generalized (McAuliffe et al 2013), as shown in Table 13.5.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Complications associated with epilepsy are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Trauma occurring during the seizure and include tongue biting and head or limb injury.</li>
                            <li>Status epilepticus: a seizure lasting for >30 minutes, or a series of seizures without regaining consciousness in between.</li>
                            <li>Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) of which there is no cause found for the sudden death.</li>
                            <li>Maternal death: the risk of sudden maternal death in pregnancy remains higher in women with epilepsy than those with other long-term conditions. A number of these maternal deaths are classified as sudep.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Treatment is with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) with monotherapy (one drug) or polytherapy (two or more) if seizure control is more problematic. In certain cases surgery or vagus nerve stimulation might be used (McAuliffe et al 2013).</p>
                        <p>Pre-conception care is of paramount importance as many AEDs are associated with folate deficiency and fetal abnormalities. The drug therapy may be changed to monotherapy after careful counselling about the risks of teratogenicity to the fetus and folic acid should be prescribed at an increased dose of 5 mg/day for 12 weeks prior to conception (McAuliffe et al 2013).</p>
                        <p>Management in pregnancy presents challenges and this is a high-risk pregnancy that requires referral and birth in a consultant obstetric unit. It is important to involve family and partners, as they may need to initiate first aid and safety measures as the seizure risk increases by 15-37% (McAuliffe et al 2013). Folic acid of 5 mg/day should be given throughout the first trimester, and if the woman is taking sodium valproate this should continue for all three trimesters. Women taking enzyme-inducing AEDs will require oral vitamin K for 4 weeks prior to the baby's birth to decrease the risk of fetal coagulopathy (McAuliffe et al 2013). Antiepileptic drug levels should be monitored at regular intervals and the drugs and dosage reviewed by the obstetric team. The midwife should encourage the woman to comply with the prescribed medication. In addition advice should be given to avoid bathing alone and steamy environments, and to keep bathroom doors unlocked in case of a seizure. Screening for fetal anomalies should be discussed and then initiated after informed consent. A detailed structural ultrasound scan is offered between 18 and 22 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>For labour the midwife should discuss a realistic birth plan, and be aware that water birth is contraindicated on safety grounds (McAuliffe et al 2013). The risk of tonic-clonic seizure in labour is low at 1-2% but measures should be taken to react speedily should a seizure result. The management principles for an epileptic seizure are the same as for eclampsia (see Box 13.7). Anticonvulsant medication is continued throughout labour and regular review by the obstetric team is indicated. If seizures recur, short-acting benzodiazepines are administered (McAuliffe et al 2013). The woman should not be left alone in labour, and dehydration, hyperventilation and exhaustion should be avoided as they can all trigger a seizure. Should a seizure result, the differential diagnosis of eclampsia needs to be considered (Lowe and Sen 2005). Pethidine is contraindicated as it is metabolized to norpethidine which can also induce seizure, and either trans-electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) or epidural should be considered as an alternative. The birth can be spontaneously facilitated by the midwife. Following obtaining informed consent from the woman, vitamin K should be administered to the baby promptly after birth to protect against AED-induced haemorrhagic disease (McAuliffe et al 2013).</p>
                        <p>In the first 24 hours following the birth the woman has an increased risk of a seizure and so should remain in hospital. Breastfeeding is encouraged and the medical team and pharmacist should discuss suitable AEDs while lactating. The baby should be carefully observed and any concerns reported to the paediatrician immediately. Antiepileptic drugs affect hormonal contraceptives and alternative contraception such as barrier methods are recommended (see Chapter 27). Advice should be given about safety when caring for the baby in case of maternal seizure. The midwife should encourage the woman to dress, change and feed the baby on a changing mat on the floor to prevent falling during a seizure while attending to the baby. It is advisable that the baby is bathed by the mother in shallow water when someone else is around to assist if necessary and a carrycot or baby car seat should be used to carry the baby up and down stairs. When parents choose a pram/buggy for their baby, the midwife should advise them to ensure that they select one with brakes that initiate when the handle is released.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Genital tract sepsis</h3>
                        <p>Genital tract sepsis is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality and accounted for 29 deaths in the most recent triennial report, being the leading cause of direct maternal deaths in the UK (Harper 2011). Of these deaths, three were classified as late direct deaths occurring more than 6 weeks after the baby's birth, albeit the women became ill before or soon after they had given birth and so should be of great concern to all health professionals undertaking maternity care.</p>
                        <p>Genital tract sepsis arises from polymicrobial infections, usually from streptococcal bacteria, which can lead to overwhelming septicaemia that can affect not only the wellbeing of the pregnant woman but also the fetus. Signs and symptoms include pyrexia, swinging pyrexia and hypothermia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, tachycardia and tachypnoea. All childbearing woman should be advised of the possible signs and symptoms of infection at all stages and be encouraged to seek advice promptly, to pay attention to effective hygiene and be aware of the risk from others, particularly any who have bacterial throat infections (Draycott et al 2011).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)</h4>
                        <p>It is estimated that between 10%-30% of women will experience Bacterial vaginosis (BV) during their pregnancy, which is a common cause of abnormal discharge due to an imbalance of normal bacteria that inhabit the vagina. Typical symptoms are an offensive, fishy-smelling discharge. Although BV may regress spontaneously and even if treated with topical or oral metronidazole or clindamycin, it may recur. Whilst there is evidence that links BV with preterm labour, late miscarriage, and premature rupture of membranes, treatment studies have yielded inconsistent results. Consequently, current guidelines only recommends screening pregnant women identified as high risk of preterm birth (Hay 2012).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Candida albicans</h3>
                        <p>Candida albicans is a yeast that causes itching, soreness and swelling of the genital area producing a creamy-white vaginal discharge. Candida albicans is not a Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) as it commonly occurs during pregnancy, following antibiotic therapy and in individuals who have diabetes or a lowered immune system. It is easily diagnosed by a high vaginal swab (HVS) and treatment in pregnancy is via topical cream and/or vaginal pessaries, rather than via the oral route. Candida does not affect fertility or pregnancy outcome, but the baby may develop oral or genital thrush. This in turn may affect breastfeeding should candida be transferred to the breast while feeding (Francis-Morrill et al 2004; Weiner 2006).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Chlamydia trachomatis</h3>
                        <p>Chlamydia is the most commonly diagnosed STI, especially in under 25-year-olds, and is caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. Between 70 and 80% of women affected by chlamydia are asymptomatic. Signs and symptoms usually occur from 1 to 3 weeks following infection and include dysuria, vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, post-coital and inter-menstrual bleeding, anal discharge, conjunctivitis, eye infections and sore throats following anal or oral sexual practices. If left untreated, chlamydial infection can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which increases infertility and the risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>Methods of testing are varied and can include urine testing, low vaginal swab (self-testing kits) and cervical swab. The NHS National Chlamydia Screening Programme (2012) recommends annual screening for under 25-year-olds if sexually active. Chlamydia can be transmitted to the neonate during vaginal birth and can result in neonatal eye infections and pneumonia. Treatment entails antibiotics such as azithromycin.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Cytomegalovirus</h3>
                        <p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common viral infection from the herpes family, which may lie dormant and recur at a later time. It is estimated that 50% of the adult population has had the infection at some point in their lives. The virus causes a mild flu-like illness and pregnant women have an increased susceptibility to infection during pregnancy. However, primary infection in pregnancy is low, at around 1%. There is a 40% chance of transmission to the fetus causing congenital malformations such as hearing loss, learning difficulties and cerebral palsy. Around 5-10% of infected babies are symptomatic at birth and consequently their prognosis is poor. Furthermore, the risk relative to gestation is unclear. Although antiviral drugs have been used to treat CMV, there is currently no screening programme due to a lack of sensitivity in pregnancy or evidence-based effective treatment interventions (UK National Screening Committee 2012).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Gonorrhoea</h3>
                        <p>Gonorrhoea is a common STI in the UK, affecting the genital tract (especially the cervix) and rectum. It is transmitted by sexual activity with an infected individual and is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Although most individuals are often asymptomatic, signs and symptoms may occur 2-10 days after initial contact (Bignall and Fitzgerald 2011). Such symptoms include painful micturition, yellow/bloodstained vaginal discharge and postcoital bleeding.</p>
                        <p>If untreated, in women it can cause PID, giving rise to abdominal cramps, fever and inter-menstrual bleeding, with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. Individuals are also at a greater risk of acquiring HIV.</p>
                        <p>Testing for gonorrhoea is via urine and cervical swabs. More effective screening programmes detect the genes of the bacteria, rather than try to culture the bacteria. Treatment is with antibiotics, but drug resistance can be problematic. Gonorrhoea can be transmitted to the neonate during vaginal birth and can result in eye infections.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Hepatitis A, B and C</h3>
                        <p>Hepatitis comprises a group of blood-borne viruses that cause hepatocellular inflammation and necrosis. They are found in bodily fluids, e.g. blood, saliva and semen, and are often transmitted via sexual activity, by sharing injecting equipment and via the placenta to the fetus during pregnancy. Vaccination for hepatitis A and B are available. Hepatitis B and C can lead to liver failure and death and are therefore notifiable diseases in the UK.</p>
                        <p>Pregnant women are offered routine screening for hepatitis B during early pregnancy and those at risk, e.g. sex workers, can be tested for hepatitis C. Any woman found to have hepatitis B virus (HBV) should have further tests to determine whether she is acutely or chronically infected; the presence of the e-antigen (HBeAg) denotes high infectivity, while the presence of antibodies (antiHBe) suggest a lower infectivity. During pregnancy women are counselled as to how they can reduce transmission and infants should be given hepatitis B immunization and immunoglobulin with their mother's consent, which can reduce vertical transmission by 90% (Watkins et al 2013). Breastfeeding is not contraindicated, although the presence of cracked nipples is a significant transmission risk.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)</h3>
                        <p>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that weakens an individual's immune system by invading the T4-helper cells making it difficult to mount an immune response to infection. There are two types of HIV which belong to the lentivirus subfamily of retroviruses that cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV-1 is the cause of the world pandemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), whereas HIV-2 is largely confined to West Africa. HIV is transmitted through unprotected sexual activity with an infected person, contact with infected bodily fluids, e.g. blood, or perinatally via mother-to-fetus-transmission. Two to six weeks after exposure to HIV, 50-70% develop a transient nonspecific illness (primary infection or seroconversion illness) with flu-like symptoms, e.g. pyrexia, rash and sore throat. This coincides with the development of serum antibodies to the core and surface proteins of the virus. The illness begins abruptly and usually lasts for 1-2 weeks, but may be more protracted.</p>
                        <p>Diagnosis is through an HIV test, where blood is examined for the presence of antibodies and/or antigens; this is known as the combined test. Pregnant women are offered an HIV test in early pregnancy (RCOG 2010b). Although there is no cure for HIV, antiretroviral (ART) therapy has significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality observed in previous decades. Without ART, seroconversion is followed by a clinically latent phase of about 10 years. During this time there is intense viral and lymphocyte turnover with worsening immunodeficiency and about one-third of infected individuals will experience persistent lymphadenopathy. The average time for progression from HIV to AIDS is between 5 and 20 years.</p>
                        <p>The prevalence of HIV in pregnancy is around 1 in 500 maternities and management aims to reduce the rate of transmission to the fetus, however, this is <2%, as most transmission occurs during birth or in the postnatal period through breastfeeding (RCOG 2010b). Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) should continue, with elective caesarean section and the avoidance of breastfeeding. Fakoya et al (2008) reported that a planned vaginal birth should be considered for those women who have plasma viral loads of <50 copies/ml. As a result, this management regime has reduced the rates of HIV transmission to the fetus to <1% (RCOG 2010b).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Human papillomavirus</h3>
                        <p>The human papillomavirus (HPV) is attributed to causing the second most common STI in the UK. It has over 100 strains, of which strains 6 and 11 are known to cause genital warts, which are more common in teenagers and young adults. They present as small, fleshy, painless growths, single or in clusters, appearing on the vaginal and anal regions following close genital contact or sexual activity with an affected person. The warts usually appear within 2-3 months of infection, but can take up to a year to become evident.</p>
                        <p>Treatment is either with topical lotions/creams or physical ablation, or a combination. Pregnancy may affect the size and number of warts and there is a small risk that they may affect progress in labour, as well as there being evidence of rare cases of transmissions to the baby during birth. Human papillomavirus strains 16 and 18 are associated with cervical cancer and vaccinations are available to all young women up to the age of 18 years. Emerging evidence from Ali et al (2013) would indicate that vaccination is reducing genital wart prevalence in young women.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Streptococcus A and B</h3>
                        <p>Group A streptococcus (GAS) bacteria cause a variety of infections, such as acute pharyngitis, toxic shock syndrome, cellulitis and puerperal sepsis. Group B streptococcus (GBS) bacteria are commonly found in the vagina and lower bowel of around 40% of healthy adult women, where they remain dormant. GBS is not contagious, but it can cause neonatal GBS infection if the fetus comes into contact with the bacteria, usually during birth. However, GBS infection has been known to pass across the membranes and colonize the fetus in utero.</p>
                        <p>Women at higher risk of GBS include those in preterm labour, those with premature pre-labour rupture of membranes, prolonged rupture of membranes (>18 hr), and those with maternal pyrexia and a previous history of GBS. Screening is not currently offered routinely to all women but may be in the future, according to Plumb and Clayton (2013), and consists of lower vaginal swabs and rectal swabs in those at risk and IV antibiotics administered between 4 and 6 hours before birth (RCOG 2012).</p>
                        <p>GBS affects 1 in 1000 of all babies and has a mortality rate of 1 in 10, with survivors often having severe long-term disabilities (Plumb and Clayton 2013). There are two types of neonatal GBS. The most common type is early onset GBS, which is seen in 75% of cases and occurs within the first week of life, usually presenting within 24 hours of birth. The other type is late onset GBS, which presents in 25% of cases within the first 3 months of life. Signs and symptoms in an affected neonate may be vague and include problems maintaining their temperature, grunting, limpness, poor feeding behaviours and seizures. It is very important that midwives inform women of the signs and symptoms and promptly refer any ill baby.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Syphilis</h3>
                        <p>Syphilis is a STI caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum. Transmission occurs through contact with a syphilitic sore or chancre. Although the incidence of syphilis is low in the UK, worldwide the incidence in developing countries is 90%. There are four stages to the progression of the infection:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Primary: occurring on average 21 days after exposure, where a single painless, firm, non-itchy ulcer or chancre appears.</li>
                            <li>Secondary: occurs between 4 and 10 weeks after exposure, with the appearance of a non-itchy, diffuse rash with fever and sore throat evident. In the latent stage, the individual is generally asymptomatic, but still contagious to others.</li>
                            <li>Tertiary: can occur between 3 to 15 years after the initial exposure. If the individual does not seek treatment, they will exhibit neurological symptoms such as general paresis and seizures, as well as cardiac symptoms including aneurysms.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The presence of syphilitic sores increases the transmission risk of HIV. Diagnosis is via a blood test and the treatment is penicillin. It is highly likely that transmission of syphilis will occur in pregnancy, causing preterm birth, stillbirth or perinatal death, thus screening for syphilis should be routinely offered to all pregnant women during the early antenatal period (NICE 2010c; Watkins et al 2013). The baby may be born with congenital syphilis, which is asymptomatic during infancy, but later in childhood they may develop multi-organ conditions such as deafness, seizures and cataracts.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Urinary tract infection</h3>
                        <p>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common problem in pregnancy if pathogenic bacteria colonize the urinary tract. The bacteria originate from the bowel and the most commonly encountered is Escherichia coli (E. coli). Such an infection may be asymptomatic or present with symptoms of dysuria (a burning pain on micturition), frequency (small regular amounts of urine), suprapubic discomfort and haematuria (blood in the urine). If the infection is confined to the bladder it is termed cystitis, and in addition to these symptoms there may be urgency of micturition.</p>
                        <p>The infection can ascend to the kidneys and pyelonephritis develops. Acute pyelonephritis may present with nausea and vomiting, pyrexia, rigors and abdominal pain (James et al 2011). If inadequately treated, septicaemia may result, leading to acute renal failure, multiple organ failure and death (Brunskill and Goodlife 2013).</p>
                        <p>Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU), as the name implies, is an infection without symptoms and occurs in 2-10% of pregnancies (NICE 2010c). The presence of 10<sup>5</sup>/ml of the same bacterial species in a midstream specimen of urine (MSSU) in the absence of symptoms confirms the diagnosis. This is of significance in pregnancy, as 25% of women will proceed to develop pyelonephritis and there is also risk of preterm labour (James et al 2011).</p>
                        <p>All pregnant women should have their urine tested for nitrates (which are produced by most urinary pathogens) at each antenatal visit. A mid-stream specimen of urine (MSSU) should be taken early in pregnancy (NICE 2010c), and repeated if there are symptoms of a UTI. Treatment is with antibiotics according to the culture and sensitivity from the MSSU results, and the MSSU should be repeated following treatment. If the causative organism is group B streptococcus, an alert note should be placed on the woman's maternity case notes. The midwife should encourage the woman to drink at least 2 litres of fluid per day, comply with antibiotic therapy, give advice on personal hygiene, especially following micturition, and recommend cranberry juice which may reduce infection and its symptoms (Brunskill and Goodlife 2013).</p>
                        <p>If the infection is still active when the woman commences labour she should be reviewed by the obstetrician and IV antibiotics may be commenced for the duration of labour and the immediate postnatal period. Urinary catheterization should be avoided. If the UTI persists into the postnatal period, then further investigations are indicated (Brunskill and Goodlife 2013).</p>
