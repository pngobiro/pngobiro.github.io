                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In 2007, a survey of 3682 women (Nolan 2008) from all parts of the United Kingdom (UK) revealed that a large number had been offered no or very few antenatal classes during their most recent pregnancy. Many of those who had attended classes were dissatisfied with their quality, criticizing in particular the unrealistic portrayal of labour, birth and early parenting, lack of practical skills work to help them use their own resources for coping with the pain of labour, and being given no opportunity to discuss how to cope with being a mother.</p>
                        <p>These comments are in line with research carried out over the past 20 years. The study by Spiby and coworkers (1999) found that women were dissatisfied with the time given to practising self-help skills for labour during antenatal classes and cited this as a reason for not being able to put such skills into practice when they were actually in labour. The study by Ho and Holroyd (2002) of Hong Kong women’s experience of classes highlighted the lack of engagement of midwives with women’s individual worries. Women felt that the sessions were not organized around their life situations rather than according to subject matter. Too much information was given in the short time available and there was too little emphasis on discussion to enable women to hear each other’s viewpoints and move towards deciding what was best for them in their particular circumstances. The women especially highlighted that they had not been able to make friends. The importance of antenatal classes as an opportunity for developing a peer support network has featured repeatedly in the literature over many years; for example, the study by Stamler (1998) found that the seven women interviewed wanted ‘more socialization’ and considered classes unsatisfactory that did not encourage this by facilitating discussion. More recently, Nolan et al (2012) explored the nature of friendships made at antenatal classes and identified their role in securing women’s mental health in the early months of new motherhood by allowing them to share information about babycare, normalizing their experiences and increasing their confidence to manage their own and their babies’ welfare.</p>
                        <p>In the year of publication of the survey carried out by Nolan during 2007 which highlighted the steady decrease in the availability of antenatal education (Nolan 2008), the Child Health Promotion Programme (Department of Health [DH] 2008) described the government’s commitment to a new emphasis on parenting support, especially for first-time mothers and fathers. This document spoke of the need for stable positive relationships within families in order to provide the best possible home environment for babies to develop robust physical and emotional health. It advocated approaches to educating and supporting parents that focused on their strengths rather than on their deficits. Fathers were brought to the fore and services were reminded that men must be included in all perinatal and childcare services, to ensure that they were equally as well informed as mothers and able to make a strong, positive contribution to the upbringing of their children.</p>
                        <p>This focus on supporting families with babies stemmed from the increasingly public profile of new evidence from neuroscience showing that the development of the unborn baby was affected not only by genetic heritage, the efficiency of the placenta, the quality of the mother’s diet, whether she smoked, her use of alcohol, prescribed and street drugs, but also by her mental and emotional wellbeing.</p>
                        <p>Wadhwa et al (1993: 858) concluded that ‘independent of biomedical risk, maternal prenatal stress factors are significantly associated with infant birth weight and with gestational age at birth’. At the beginning of the 21st century, Glover and O’Connor (2002) produced evidence from 7448 women participating in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children that the pregnant woman’s mood could have a direct effect not just on newborn babies’ weight, but also on their brain development, with later consequences for behavioural development throughout childhood. A meta-analysis (Talge et al 2007) of studies looking at the relationship between maternal mental health, babies’ development in utero and their progress during the first years of life, concluded that maternal stress in pregnancy makes it substantially more likely that children will have emotional, cognitive and physical problems. Neuroscience also explained how the architecture of the brain is shaped by new babies’ earliest experiences, that is, by their relationship with their primary caregiver(s). While antenatal education had traditionally focused on helping mothers (and sometimes fathers) acquire practical babycare skills such as changing nappies, feeding and bathing babies, neuroscience suggested that equal emphasis should be placed on helping parents understand how their newborn babies are primed to enter into a relationship with them, and how they invite interaction through a variety of cues.</p>
                        <p>A generation of childcare gurus had battled for supremacy over the hearts and minds of new parents, from those advocating ‘attachment parenting’ (Liedloff 1986; Jackson 2003) to those requiring that both parents and baby adhere to a strict routine as soon as the baby is born (Ford 2006). Parents had also been persuaded that ‘early education’ in the form of playing Mozart through headphones placed on the pregnant woman’s abdomen, or teaching infants to ‘sign’ would give them a head start. Now the evidence was supporting parents’ basic instinct to respond to their children when they cried, to enjoy playing with them and to ‘watch, wait and wonder’ (Cohen et al 1999). The importance of ‘mutual gaze’ (simply looking at the baby), talking and singing to the baby (with nursery rhymes very much back in fashion) and baby massage to promote the release of the ‘social hormone’, oxytocin, were all established on a solid evidence base that was also in tune with most parents’ instinctive understanding of how to meet their babies’ needs.</p>
                        <p>This evidence, coupled with uncomfortable reports stating that Britain’s children and young people were amongst the unhappiest in Europe (Children’s Society 2012), impelled government to reconsider the value of pregnancy as an educational opportunity. Pregnancy is an ideal opportunity for helping women acquire understanding, skills and support networks to make the transition to motherhood less stressful and more fulfilling, both for them and for their infants. Midwives, health visitors and childbirth educators had long known that pregnancy was ‘a teachable moment’, a period of crisis that renders women and men unusually open to reflecting on their self concept, lifestyle, values and ideas about parenthood. The Department of Health (DH 2009) set up an Expert Reference Group to devise a programme of high-quality antenatal education which would ‘help prepare parents for parenthood from early pregnancy onwards’ (section 3.36).</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The Expert Reference Group (DH 2009) commissioned a systematic review of antenatal education to inform its work. This review (McMillan et al 2009) found that the quality of research into antenatal group-based education was generally poor. The Review’s conclusions were, therefore, tentatively presented. Some evidence was found for a positive effect on maternal psychological wellbeing when antenatal programmes focused on:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the emotional changes that men and women experience across the transition to parenthood</li>
                            <li>the couple relationship</li>
                            <li>parenting skills and early childcare</li>
                            <li>bonding and attachment</li>
                            <li>problem-solving skills.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The review by McMillan et al (2009) also found evidence that programmes focusing on strengthening the couple’s relationship in preparation for parenting improved parental confidence and satisfaction with the couple and parentinfant relationship in the postnatal period. No evidence was found of a link between attending antenatal classes and improved birth outcomes in terms of reduced caesarean section or instrumental delivery rates.</p>
                        <p>Effective facilitation of antenatal programmes was found to be dependent on their being sensitive to people’s cultures, responsive to both parents, participative and focused on building social support. This was in agreement with a powerful study of ‘maternal health literacy’ carried out by Renkert and Nutbeam (2001) which noted that ‘teaching methods (in antenatal classes) were heavily weighted towards the transfer of factual information, as distinct from the development of decision making skills, and practical skills for childbirth and parenting’. The study concluded that, ‘if the purpose of antenatal classes is to improve maternal health literacy, then women need to leave a class with the skills and confidence to take a range of actions that contribute to a successful pregnancy, childbirth and early parenting’ (Renkert and Nutbeam 2001: 381). Women need to know where they can find more information, how to access support and what resources are available to them in the community.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There is a popular myth, much detested by teachers, that ‘those who can, do, and those who can’t, teach’. Leading a group of adults may not primarily be about teaching, although in the case of antenatal sessions, there is likely to be an element of instruction. However, ensuring that participants find the experience of attending classes as relevant and useful as possible, demands sophisticated skills on the part of the group leader. It is unfortunate that while the potential of antenatal and postnatal groups has been recognized anew, there is an increasing tendency to use unqualified maternity support workers and parent link workers to lead them rather than midwives. The quality of health and social care services has regularly been linked to the level of training of those who deliver them. Recently, nursery provision has come under scrutiny and a clear link established between how well carers understand the needs of very small children, and the optimal development of those children (Department for Children, Schools and Families [DCSF] 2012). The same is true of antenatal sessions. If the aim is to run a peer support group where mothers and fathers can get to know each other, then little more is required than an accessible venue, a pleasant room, comfortable seating, refreshments and someone to introduce people to each other. However, the presence of an educated, confident, competent and empathic group leader is essential if antenatal sessions are to help participants identify and acquire information relevant to their life circumstances and practise new skills. Trained facilitators can help parents challenge each other’s beliefs and change or renew them in the light of ideas they might not have considered before.</p>
                        <p>While ideally, antenatal group courses would be led by the same person throughout, this is not always possible ‘in the real world’, just as it is not always possible for a woman to have the same midwife throughout childbirth. If several people are taking responsibility for antenatal sessions, it is vital that they have spent time together, talking about and agreeing what it is they want to achieve. These aims then underpin every session, whoever is the group leader, and ensure that the mothers and fathers attending have an integrated learning experience. The aims for one Community Healthcare Trust’s antenatal programme are given in Box 8.1.</p>

                        <h3>Sharing information</h3>
                        <p>Any antenatal group session is likely to involve informationsharing, discussion and practical skills work. Of these, the first is probably the area in which many group leaders who are health professionals feel most competent, and the one in which they are often, in fact, least. There are two pitfalls: first, to believe that the more information given, the better; and the second, that giving information will change people’s behaviour.</p>
                        <p>The fact that many group leaders know from personal experience that most information is forgotten as soon as individuals leave a lecture, does not deter them from overloading mothers and fathers with information. In order for people to retain information:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>it must be the information that they want at that moment in their lives;</li>
                            <li>it must be linked either to first-hand or to vicarious experiences;</li>
                            <li>it must be presented succinctly in as many different forms as possible.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Many topics that might be covered in antenatal sessions are huge, for example, ‘Labour and Birth’. Yet mothers and fathers do not need to know the anatomy and physiology or the clinical management of labour and birth in the depth that a midwife needs to know these things. What group participants need to know is ‘what will it be like for me?’</p>
                        <p>A fascinating experiment was conducted in an oldfashioned ‘Nightingale Ward’ in the 1950s (Janis 1958) with patients undergoing prostate surgery. The patients on one side of the ward were given detailed, technical information about the surgical procedures they would undergo, including the names of the instruments and drugs employed. The patients on the other side of the ward were given descriptions of the sensations involved in having an anaesthetic, waking up after surgery and recovering from an abdominal wound. The patients who had received this kind of information made far speedier recoveries than those given ‘textbook’ information.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 8.2 Sharing group knowledge and experience</h4>
                            <p>It is often the case that group members know far more about a topic than might be expected. Finding out what the group knows, and building on that knowledge is an important skill for the group leader. The example below is taken from a recent antenatal session.</p>
                            <p>When asked to talk about friends’ experiences of having a caesarean section, group members’ pooled knowledge proved extensive:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>some friends had had planned caesareans and some emergency</li>
                                <li>emergency caesareans were more traumatic for both mother and father (and probably the baby)</li>
                                <li>the surgery proceeded quickly until the birth of the baby; once the baby was born, the mother remained in theatre for quite a long time</li>
                                <li>some fathers found being present during surgery daunting</li>
                                <li>often the father held the baby first because the mother had drips in both arms</li>
                                <li>there was an unexpected amount of pain afterwards and it could be difficult for the mother to hold the baby for feeding</li>
                                <li>some mothers recovered quickly and were back to normal in a few weeks; some took months</li>
                                <li>some mothers felt fine about their caesarean and some felt as if they had ‘failed’.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In this session, the group leader had little to do beyond answering a few questions raised by the group and stressing the importance of asking for help with the baby on the postnatal ward, keeping the wound clean, recognizing signs of infection, and not expecting to do too much once home.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Mothers and fathers attending antenatal sessions already know a great deal - they will be the repositories of both correct and incorrect information. The task of the group leader is to elicit what they know so that she can reinforce what is correct and restructure what is not. Asking participants to share their own experiences of a particular aspect of labour, for example having an induction, or what they have heard about it from friends and other informants, enables her to judge the level of knowledge in the group and to find out what parents want to know. By exploring the details of the experience as described by members of the group, acknowledging accurate information, asking group members themselves to correct misinformation (which they are often able to do), answering questions raised by people on a need to know basis, a rich learning experience is provided (as seen in Box 8.2). Embedding new information in a web made up of what people already know and their shared ideas of what an experience might be like, provides the most effective means of transmitting information that may influence their decision-making.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>A study by Stapleton et al (2002) of the effectiveness of the MIDwives Information Resource Service (MIDIRS) information leaflets came to the conclusion that women did not value or use information that was presented to them ‘cold’, in this case, in leaflet form. They did value having the opportunity to discuss the information in the leaflets with a midwife or well-informed person who could answer their questions. This research constitutes a warning to group leaders who believe that informationgiving is satisfactory without interaction with the recipient and discussion as to its relevance to the woman’s circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The more varied the means by which information is transmitted, the more locations in the brain will be used to store it. This increases the likelihood that information will be retained. The repertoire of creative ideas for facilitating learning that is demonstrated by any primary school teacher is just as relevant for the person leading an antenatal group session with adults. The adult brain is assisted to retain information in the same way as the child’s. Pictures that present information visually aid memory and enhance enjoyment of learning, which in itself makes learning more effective. Today, there is a huge range of video material available which can be used to present facts in an exciting way, or provide material to trigger discussion. A quick foray into YouTube will produced a multitude of video clips ideal for antenatal sessions.</p>
                        <p>Three-dimensional models that parents can handle to enable learning to take place through the hands and eyes, such as plastic pelves, dolls, different kinds of nappies and pieces of clinical equipment, help in the journey from simply knowing facts to understanding them and ultimately to applying them. Role-play is also a form of threedimensional modelling that is enormously effective in enriching mothers’ and fathers’ concept of ‘what it will be like’.</p>
                        <h3>Promoting discussion</h3>
                        <p>It is often mistakenly assumed that an educational group in which the leader gives information and the group members are free to ask questions is having a discussion. However, a group whose interactions can be charted as in Fig. 8.1 is not having a discussion but rather, a question and answer session.</p>
                        <p>A group whose interactions can be charted as in Fig. 8.2 depicts a more engaging discussion.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_28_c51b551507f_v2_g-150-2.jpg" alt="A diagram showing interactions among a group engaged in discussion. Arrows point between various participants and the group leader, indicating a free flow of conversation." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Fig. 8.2 Interactions among a group engaged in discussion.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>In order to have a discussion, group members need to know a little about each other and therefore to feel at ease. A group consisting of more than six will deter many people from contributing and the group leader therefore has to break a big group into smaller units so that making a contribution becomes less daunting. Ice-breakers are important to help people start to learn each other’s names and something of each other’s history, as well as because they make a statement that this group is going to be as much about participants talking as about the group leader talking.</p>
                        <p>The first 10 minutes of a group session are an excellent learning opportunity. People are usually excited about joining the group, perhaps slightly anxious. As long as they are not paralysed with nerves, a little adrenalin in the system primes them for learning. Ice-breakers can incorporate both a ‘getting to know you’ element and an exchange of ideas on topics integral to the antenatal course. Having invited group members to form small groups or three or four people, they might talk about:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What they already know about their unborn babies. Aim: to develop the relationship between parents and their babies.</li>
                            <li>Where they are planning on giving birth and why they have chosen this location. Aim: to establish parents as the individuals who make decisions for themselves and their babies.</li>
                            <li>What they see as the most enjoyable aspects of parenting, and what the most challenging. Aim: to encourage reflection on parenting, and project beyond the birth of the baby.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Sharing thoughts and feelings, even if cautiously in the beginning, enables group members to appreciate that there is much they have in common as ‘becoming parents’, and to have their fears and worries ‘normalized’. Establishing the commonalities that mark everyone’s journey into parenthood provides a secure basis from which group members can develop friendships and engage in future, perhaps more profound discussions.</p>
                        <p>Research by Nolan et al 2012 has shown that friendship formation may proceed at a faster pace when happening in pregnancy, and bypass much of the ‘social chit-chat’ that generally characterizes the early stages of relationships. An emerging appreciation of the responsibilities that parenting entails and of the extent to which current lifestyles will change following the birth of a baby motivates people, in the interests of survival, to reach out to others for support and companionship. Perhaps the overriding duty of antenatal group sessions is to facilitate the forming of friendships and this is dependent on providing multiple opportunities for people to get to know each other.</p>
                        <p>The use of open-ended questions such as ‘How do you feel about that?’, ‘Could you say a little more?’, and of reflecting questions raised by group members back to the group ‘Would anyone like to answer that from their point of view?’, are key tools in promoting discussion. Discussion may also be facilitated by prompts such as pictures and video clips, by inviting new parents to visit the group to talk about their experiences and by engaging the group in activities that require them to do more than simply write down facts. Finding the right trigger for discussion can transform a group that appears disinterested in the session into one where everyone is contributing and learning (see Box 8.3).</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 8.3 Promoting valuable discussion</h4>
                            <p>A fairly reserved group of young mothers quickly began to function as a group in which quality learning was taking place when asked to discuss how to manage with a new baby with only £67 a week. During the vigorous exchanges that took place, the teenagers learned from each other which shops offered the best prices for nappies and an array of household items; how to prepare a variety of easy-to-make, inexpensive (and often nutritious) meals; how to avoid bank charges; where to go to find out about benefit entitlements; and what each thought about the amount of help boyfriends and partners should give with the new baby.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Practical skills work</h3>
                        <p>The survey by Nolan (2008) of antenatal education noted that many women wanted more time in their antenatal sessions to be devoted to practising self-help skills for labour such as breathing and other relaxation techniques, different positions and massage. While fathers may not ask to learn babycare skills, group leaders should make it a priority to help men learn how to change nappies, bathe, soothe and settle babies. If men feel confident and competent to care for their babies, they are able to offer practical support to the mother in the early postnatal period. High levels of father involvement are strongly linked with both mothers’ and fathers’ satisfaction with their relationship and with family life (Craig and Sawriker 2006).</p>
                        <p>Many antenatal group leaders are daunted at the prospect of leading practical sessions. This discomfort may be attributed to lack of ease with their own bodies, lack of belief that teaching such skills makes a difference in labour, a perception that group members might be reluctant to participate, and poor quality venues where there is insufficient space for people to move around freely. Leaders whose only preparation for antenatal group sessions was a couple of lectures during their pre-registration training, and whose apprenticeship as group leaders has been spent observing other group leaders equally diffident about introducing practical work, are understandably nervous. Yet labour, birth and caring for babies are intensely physical activities (as is midwifery) and people need practice to be well prepared for their role either as parent (or as midwife).</p>
                        <p>The best way to gain in confidence to teach physical skills is to observe and speak to as many skilled practitioners as possible. Active Birth teachers, Hypnobirthing therapists, Birth Dance teachers, antenatal teachers trained by the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) - all of these are able to demonstrate and analyse the facilitation of practical skills work.</p>
                        <p>These are some of the ways of making practical work easier for both group leaders and mothers and fathers:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensure that you know why you are teaching these skills, and that group participants have a strong rationale for why they should practise them.</li>
                            <li>Ask everyone to try the same exercises at the same time.</li>
                            <li>Demonstrate what you want people to do - with confidence.</li>
                            <li>Support people constantly while they are practising, giving positive feedback and making suggestions to each woman or couple individually.</li>
                            <li>Have a laugh with the group.</li>
                            <li>Relate the skills being practised to the stage of labour for which they are relevant.</li>
                            <li>If practising babycare skills, separate the fathers from the mothers because women tend to mock men’s efforts while men will strongly support each other. So the men can practise bathing and dressing a doll at one end of the room, and the women at the other.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Group members may seem reluctant to participate in practical work, but provided that the group leader is sufficiently confident, she will be able to help people overcome their anxiety. The learning that is achieved through practical work can be dramatic (see Box 8.4).</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 8.4 Practical skills: a significant impact</h4>
                            <p>A group that included a very young father who was clearly attending antenatal sessions under a certain amount of duress was taught some simple baby massage skills. While everyone was practising, the group leader put on a CD of nursery rhymes and talked about how massaging a baby and singing or reciting nursery rhymes would make the baby feel secure, help him or her develop language, and be a source of enjoyment for both parent and child. At the end of the session, the young father asked the leader where he could get a copy of the CD she had used and where he could attend baby massage sessions with his baby.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The Expert Reference Group convened by the Department of Health in 2007 devised an antenatal programme based on six themes which they felt best captured what the literature said was important to people making the journey into parenthood. These six themes - Getting to Know Your Unborn Baby; Changes for Me and Us; Giving Birth and Meeting Our Baby; Our Health and Wellbeing; Caring for Our Baby; and Who is There for Us? People and Resources - were not necessarily meant to be delivered in six sessions, with one session for each theme. Instead, the themes were intended to permeate every session.</p>
                        <h3>Getting to Know Our Unborn Baby</h3>
                        <p>Given recent research indicating that the development of the baby’s brain is affected by maternal physical and emotional wellbeing, topics such as healthy diet and lifestyle and coping with stress are very important. The difficulty is that the best time to discuss these topics is prior to pregnancy. Even early pregnancy classes happen too late since they are difficult to arrange before the end of the first trimester (and many women are reluctant to acknowledge their pregnancy publicly before they are safely past the first three months). By the second trimester, making changes in lifestyle will have less impact, although by no means, none. A strong case should therefore be made by the midwifery profession for midwives to be active in schools, leading the curriculum on pregnancy, birth and parenting.</p>
                        <p>There is scope, however, for antenatal group sessions to increase participants’ understanding of how the unborn baby is affected by the mother’s state of mind. This is not so as to induce guilt in mothers who are experiencing stress over which they have no control (living with domestic abuse; unable to speak English; isolated from family and friends; burdened with financial worries etc.) but to emphasize that every mother and baby are uniquely in harmony with each other, and respond to each other’s moods. The closeness of the relationship is designed to ensure the survival of the baby. Topics that might, therefore, be covered under the heading of Getting to Know Our Unborn Baby (see Box 8.5) are how the baby’s brain develops during pregnancy; what the baby can see, hear, taste, touch and smell and at what stage of pregnancy; what part the baby plays in the initiation of labour, and how recreating the experience of the uterus can comfort newborn babies (being held close, hearing their mothers’ heartbeat and voice, being kept warm through contact with their mothers’ skin, being fed on demand). Relaxation can be taught as a skill to reduce adrenalin levels and optimize the uterine environment for the baby as well as conferring health benefits on the mother.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 8.5 Getting to Know Our Unborn Baby: Activity</h4>
                            <p>Ask mothers and fathers to consider what life is like for their unborn baby in the womb.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>What do they know about their baby; what are the baby’s patterns or waking and sleeping?</li>
                                <li>Does the baby have particular likes or dislikes?</li>
                                <li>Does the baby have his own idiosyncrasies?</li>
                                <li>How will the baby feel when she leaves the womb and is born?</li>
                                <li>How can that change from womb to world be made as easy as possible for the baby?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Changes for Me and Us</h3>
                        <p>The Expert Reference Group acknowledged the difficulties inherent in covering lifestyle issues specifically in relation to pregnancy, and preferred to set these issues in the broader context of family life. Making decisions about reducing smoking and alcohol intake as well as improving diet may help parents provide a better environment for their new baby to grow up in as well as improving the quality of their own lives. Pregnancy also provides a 9-month period of reflection for mothers and fathers to consider how this baby will affect their network of relationships, personal interests, social obligations and work commitments. Babies enter their parents’ complex world, and planning ahead may ensure that adding one more element does not cause the whole world to fall apart (see Box 8.6).</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 8.6 Changes for Me and Us: Activity</h4>
                            <p>Invite participants to complete a 24-hour clock representing the activities of their current life. Then ask them to complete another showing their life after their baby is born with time allocated to feeding, changing, comforting and playing with the baby.</p>
                            <p>The discussion that follows focuses on how their lives are going to change, who is there to support them, what kind of support they want and how they can access it. Also how life will change for other family members, such as grandparents, and the baby’s siblings.</p>
                            <p>What kind of mother or father do they want to be? Do they have parental role models? Do they know what they definitely want to do and not do as parents?</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Giving Birth and Meeting Our Baby</h3>
                        <p>The theme of Giving Birth and Meeting Our Baby focuses on normal labour and birth, drawing on group members’ knowledge of how labour starts , how long it lasts, what helps and what does not. Since people often attack their antenatal classes postnatally on the grounds of lack of realism, it is important to use as many different teaching and learning strategies as possible to convey what labour ‘is really like’. A picture of a woman in labour can be a trigger for discussion of upright positions and birth companions’ role; pictures of the hospital environment are very helpful in contextualizing information (How might being in this room affect your labour? Who are the staff you will meet and what is their role?). Labour and birth stories are invaluable in telling it from the woman’s (or man’s) point of view and there are also YouTube videos that recount parents’ birth stories in their own words. In addition, mental rehearsal is a useful technique for helping mothers and fathers create an experience in their own minds and imagine their own roles (see Box 8.7).</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 8.7 Giving Birth and Meeting Our Baby: Activity</h4>
                            <p>While playing some relaxing background music, ask group members to make themselves comfortable and to try to imagine what might be happening to them at different points in labour:</p>
                            <p>‘Think about the start of labour, when you’re not quite sure what’s happening.</p>
                            <p>Where are you? Where do you feel safe to labour? There’s a contraction now - what position are you in?</p>
                            <p>If you’re the woman’s birth companion, how do you see yourself helping her with this contraction?</p>
                            <p>It’s eight hours later in the labour now, and you’re both in hospital. What is the room like? How are you feeling? When you have a strong contraction, how are you coping with it and what are you, as the person supporting her, doing at this point?</p>
                            <p>Can you imagine the moment when your baby is born? How do you feel? Ecstatic? Exhausted? Very emotional? Confused?</p>
                            <p>Your baby needs to be close to you both. How are you getting to know him or her now?’</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Our Health and Wellbeing</h3>
                        <p>The birth of the first child has been shown to precipitate a sudden deterioration in couples’ relationship functioning (Doss et al 2009). As the baby is completely dependent on the mother to stay alive physically and to develop emotionally and cognitively, it is vital that the mother should feel supported. For most women, the person most likely to offer that support is her partner. However, tiredness, an overwhelming sense of new responsibility, worries about diminished income, lack of couple time without the baby - all these factors contribute to minor tensions between couples escalating into major arguments. Understanding how to change vicious circles into virtuous ones gives parents a model to which they can refer in the critical early months of their baby’s life. Figure 8.3 illustrates how fathers’ involvement with their baby, or lack of involvement, can make mothers feel supported and content with their relationship with their partner, or unsupported and discontented. Helping fathers learn basic babycare skills in antenatal sessions is a very useful strategy for enabling them to play a full part in the early weeks of their new babies’ lives when mothers are most in need of help.</p>

                        <p>Depending on how many sessions the antenatal course involves and how strong a relationship the group leader is able to build up with the people attending, there may be scope for more in-depth work on relationships, such as exploring how individuals typically respond when unhappy with their partner’s behaviour - criticism, contempt, defensiveness, stonewalling (Gottman 1994) and strategies for tackling conflict.</p>
                        <p>The theme of Our Health and Wellbeing also involves looking at mental illness starting in the postnatal period, antenatal depression that gets worse after the birth of a baby (rather than talking about ‘postnatal depression’, which is not recognized in The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV [DSM IV] (American Psychiatric Association 1994) as a separate diagnosis) and looking at how mothers and fathers can keep themselves mentally healthy. It is very important to have an emphasis on mental health as everyone has to work at that, but only a few people will experience clinical depression. This topic provides another opportunity to look at lifestyles and the contribution a good diet, taking some exercise and a moderate intake of alcohol and other stimulants make to feeling mentally strong and able to cope.</p>
                        <h3>Caring for Our Baby</h3>
                        <p>Caring for Our Baby covers both the physical care of the baby and the emotional. The importance of helping parents acquire skills to be able to meet the daily physical needs of their baby has already been mentioned. Feeding is a huge area to cover and the risk of information overload is a very real one. As always with topics that are potentially information-heavy, the group leader needs to be clear in her own mind as to what are the most important things to get across, and then provide additional information in response to the questions uppermost in parents’ mind at the time. In terms of breastfeeding, it may be that the group leader feels the need to give very little information, but to address some common fears (it’s going to hurt; I won’t have enough milk; how do I know my baby’s getting sufficient milk?) and focus on ensuring that everyone in the group knows where she or he would get help if problems arise. While brief antenatal information giving sessions on breastfeeding have been found to greatly increase fathers’ understanding of how breastfeeding works and their support of mothers (Wolfberg et al 2004), it is the couples’ confidence to ask for help and their knowledge of where to find it that may be key in helping the woman to have a successful and enjoyable experience of feeding her baby.</p>
                        <p>The majority of parents are capable of meeting their baby’s emotional and learning needs if left to their own devices and not sidetracked by manuals which they erroneously believe know more about how to look after their baby than they do. Some parents will have very little of this innate understanding however, having been the recipients of very poor parenting or none at all. All parents like learning about how babies communicate and what they enjoy, about how babies comfort themselves and what is happening when babies ‘look away’ from their parents’ faces. Helping parents rediscover nursery rhymes (as illustrated in Box 8.8), poems for children and singing will give them ideas, or reinforce innate ideas, about what babies need to develop trust in human relationships and to start to learn their own language. Baby massage is a wonderful way of ensuring that mothers, fathers and babies have ‘conversations’.</p>

                            <p>Ask group participants to split into smaller groups and set up a competition (adult learners enjoy competitions every bit as much as children do!) How many nursery rhymes can they write down in a minute. (The average is around eight.)</p>
                            <p>Congratulate everyone. Ask each group to choose one nursery rhyme they all know and sing it to the other groups. Discuss how the rhythms of nursery rhymes exaggerate the rhythms of normal speech and fire the baby’s brain to make ‘language connections’.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Who Is There for Us? People and Resources</h3>
                        <p>Very little time is devoted by maternity care professionals to antenatal education and even though more is likely to be required as government takes up the challenge of supporting new parents better, there is never likely to be enough time to discuss everything that might be relevant to parents. With this in mind, the group leader has to take responsibility for knowing where to signpost parents who want more information or help now, or in the future. Signposting will probably be a part of every topic covered in the antenatal course and what kind of signposting will depend on the needs and interests of the particular group of parents participating in the course. Some examples of signposting are given in Box 8.9.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There is never enough time for antenatal sessions. This being the case, it is very important that group leaders are clear about what it is they want to achieve (their aims) and what they want participants to learn. Aims have already been discussed in this chapter. Learning outcomes are vital for ensuring that the group leader and the group remain on task and all leave the session feeling they have gained something in terms of enhanced adulthood (Knowles 1984). They are not all about head knowledge. There is also learning that takes place in the heart and learning that is physical. Therefore, a list of learning outcomes for an individual session will include learning in various ‘domains’. In order to ensure that leaders define the learning that will have taken place, rather than the process by which it will be achieved, every learning outcome needs to begin with the stem: ‘by the end of this session, participants will be able to ...’ (rather than, ‘by the end of this session, participants will have ...’).</p>
                        <p>Learning outcomes for a session covering the relationship between unborn babies and their mother, start of labour, comfort positions for labour, healthy eating during and after pregnancy, and looking after myself and my partner might be expressed as follows:</p>
                        <p>By the end of this session, participants will be able to ...</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>describe the importance of relaxation during pregnancy (and after)</li>
                            <li>state five signs that labour is about to start or has started</li>
                            <li>demonstrate three positions that might make contractions easier to manage</li>
                            <li>suggest two easy-to-make, inexpensive and nutritious meals for the first months after the baby is born</li>
                            <li>agree with their partners how to divide household chores and babycare between them</li>
                            <li>list Internet sites where they can find more information about healthy eating, and list sessions that provide more opportunities to practise self-help skills for labour.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>If antenatal education is to be universally available to all pregnant women and their partners, the way in which it is provided needs to be tailored to the needs of local communities. Time and again, when accounts are given of successful groups, it is evident that their success lies in group leaders having identified where and when to run sessions, and topics specifically relevant to the people attending.</p>
                        <p>Women and men who are highly motivated to attend antenatal sessions, perhaps because their experiences of education have led them to value it, and, more pragmatically, because they are not dependent on public transport for access, tend to go to all the sessions that are on offer. They will go to sessions led by midwives at the hospital or clinic, and also to the NCT. They may also attend yoga for pregnancy and aquanatal classes. Other parents-to-be, a very significant minority, have no antenatal education.</p>
                        <p>The reasons for nonattendance have been explored, notably by Cliff and Deery (1997) in an article entitled ‘Too like school’. These researchers identified the following barriers to attendance:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>young age</li>
                            <li>less privileged socioeconomic background</li>
                            <li>perception that the content of sessions was not relevant.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A Swedish study (Fabian et al 2004) of nonattendance at antenatal sessions found, against a background of $93\%$ attendance of first-time mothers, that primigravid nonattenders were:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>more likely not to speak Swedish as their first language</li>
                            <li>to be smokers</li>
                            <li>to have considered abortion</li>
                            <li>to have missed several antenatal checks.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Multigravid women who did not attend were:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>poorly educated</li>
                            <li>pregnant with an unplanned baby</li>
                            <li>abnormally frightened of childbirth.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These studies are helpful in terms of identifying the population of women less likely to attend antenatal sessions and some of the reasons why. Perhaps the most important reason would seem to be the fear of being judged - for smoking, for having considered a termination, for failing to attend antenatal clinic appointments, for not having planned the pregnancy and for not having done well at school. It is difficult to persuade women that they will not be judged until they have had at least one non-judgemental, respectful and person-centred experience of adult education. This requires them to come to a session. Planning to ensure sessions are as welcoming as possible to local women is therefore vital if the considerable psychological, as well as physical, barriers that many face are to be overcome.</p>
                        <p>Availability of the intended participants is the first thing to take into account:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When are women, and the people whom they want with them at the birth and who will be helping them care for the baby, free to attend sessions?</li>
                            <li>Can women drive to sessions or do they take public transport?</li>
                            <li>Which community centres are the best used, and safest (for both participants and group leaders)? Children’s Centres may be ideal in terms of their location and facilities, but not all are open in the evening when sessions may be best suited to working mothers and fathers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Planners also need to find out what is already available in the community for pregnant women. If successful hypnobirthing sessions are running, or women regularly attend aquanatal classes at the local leisure centre, or meet at a school where basic maths and English are being taught to women who missed out on education in childhood, or socialize at Asian Women’s groups, it may be possible to link antenatal sessions to these activities.</p>
                        <p>While the Expert Reference Group carried out a stakeholders’ review (summarized in DH 2011) of what people wanted to talk about and learn in their antenatal sessions and reflected the findings in the Preparation for Birth and Beyond programme’s themes, some women will have very specific needs that may be best addressed in groups run just for them. Women asylum seekers will need help in understanding the UK maternity care system. In areas where smoking rates are very high and there is a significant problem with drug abuse, antenatal education may need to focus on helping women manage these problems as well as prepare for labour, birth and early parenting. There may be areas where facilitating women-only antenatal sessions is appropriate, and areas where large numbers of women belong to faith communities that preclude their attending sessions on certain days of the week.</p>
                        <p>If women are unlikely to attend sessions for cultural reasons, antenatal education can be provided through home-based learning materials. There is a vast range of information sheets, video clips and online activities that can be brought together in a ‘pack’ and offered to pregnant women. A small group of dedicated midwives, using their in-depth knowledge of the communities they serve, could, with a little time, compile such a pack. Consulting with local childbirth and parenting educators, social workers, faith leaders and youth workers may help ensure that both the content of the pack and the way in which it is presented maximize its use and usefulness.</p>
                        <p>Young mothers may prefer to attend sessions with peers of their own age. There is evidence that they may feel inhibited at antenatal group sessions with older mothers who are in stable relationships. The most vulnerable young women may be offered the Family-Nurse Partnership (FNP) programme, which is often delivered through Sure Start Children’s Centres. This is an evidence-based intervention providing education and support from pregnancy through to the baby’s second year of life. FNP nurses, who work closely with midwives and health visitors, aim to build a strong, trusting relationship with young mothers to help them achieve a healthy pregnancy and provide a physically and emotionally safe environment for their babies. The insights gained from many years of running and evaluating the FNP in the UK informed the work of the Expert Reference Group in devising the Preparation for Birth and Beyond antenatal education package.</p>
                        <p>Personal invitation seems to be the most effective means of encouraging attendance at antenatal group sessions. The invitation is likely to be delivered by the midwife, and she should be very clear that it is an invitation both to the mother and to the person the mother would most like to bring with her. If this is the father, and the midwife knows him, using his name when issuing the invitation is both polite and an excellent way of gaining his goodwill. Texting women with the time and venue for each antenatal session is very useful, especially when reaching out to pregnant teenagers. Letters addressed to both parents can be sent out, but must start with their names, rather than ‘Dear parents’.</p>
                        <h3>Including fathers</h3>
                        <p>Research into the impact on fathers of attending antenatal sessions where their needs are identified and responded to, and the focus is on their transition to parenthood equally with the mothers’, is very positive. Studies have reported better couple relationships (Diemer 1997), mothers reporting greater satisfaction with the division of labour in relation to home and babycare tasks (Matthey et al 2004), and greater parental sensitivity (Pfannenstiel and Honig 1995).</p>
                        <p>There are various key strategies for attracting fathers to antenatal group sessions and to retaining their attendance. First, it is important to ensure that the invitation to attend is addressed both to the mothers and the fathers. Fathers Direct (now The Fatherhood Institute) (2007) recommends avoiding the term ‘parent’ as this is commonly interpreted by both men and women as meaning mothers. The Institute also recommends not using the words ‘classes’, ‘groups’ or ‘education’ in the name of the programme, but instead to use a title that indicates a practical focus, such as ‘How to Have a Baby and Look After It’. It is essential to provide sessions at times that make it possible for the fathers in the area that is being targeted to attend. Fathers who work away from home, or undertake long daily commutes, will need weekend sessions. There may be a possibility to run fathers’ sessions at the workplace, given a sympathetic employer.</p>
                        <p>Sessions need to provide opportunity for fathers to talk to each other. This means at least occasionally splitting the group by gender to allow for male bonding. When men are in a single-sex group, they interrupt each other with supportive comments, but supportive comments decrease as the number of female members in the group increases (Smith-Lovin and Brody 1989). When sessions have included single-sex small group work, group members are more likely to discuss issues with their partners after the class has ended (Symon and Lee 2003). Whole-group sessions need to include the men’s perspective on every topic. For example, ‘start of labour’ needs to consider both how the mothers may feel and the fathers. ‘Keeping mentally healthy’ needs to be about more than what the fathers can do to support the mothers, but also about what they can do to look after themselves, as shown in Box 8.10.</p>
                        <p>It is very important to make sure that visual aids depict fathers as often as mothers, and that there are handouts and literature available that are pitched specifically at them.</p>

                        <h3>How many mothers and fathers in the group?</h3>
                        <p>Traditionally, antenatal classes provided in hospitals have been open to all who wish to attend, resulting in extremely large groups. This almost certainly proves to be an unfavourable learning environment. The sessions in Ho and Holroyd’s study (2002) were attended by between 48 and 95 women. The women identified that it was impossible to engage in questioning and discussion, impossible to have their personal problems addressed, impossible to make friends and impossible for the educators to seek appropriate feedback from them.</p>
                        <p>Groups function best when they are composed of about 8 to 16 people. This ensures that the more shy members can contribute if they want to, and gives everyone an opportunity to be heard and have his or her personal needs addressed. It may be acceptable to offer information to larger groups but the expense of bringing people together has to be questioned if what is going to be achieved could equally well have been achieved by giving a handout at the antenatal clinic.</p>
                        <h3>How many sessions and how long?</h3>
                        <p>A 2007 survey of antenatal education (Nolan 2008) found that women wanted to attend more than one antenatal session. They felt that meeting over a number of weeks gave them the opportunity to get to know other women, and made it more likely that friendships would continue into the postnatal period. In addition, a single session was considered simply inadequate to cover the many topics on which they wanted information and which they wanted to discuss.</p>
                        <p>Information is retained according to its perceived relevance to learners. Antenatally, mothers and fathers will be interested especially in issues relating to pregnancy, labour, birth and the first weeks of their new baby’s life. Following the birth, as they begin to experience all the dimensions of their new role, the need for more information on some topics, and for support from other new parents and health professionals becomes apparent. For this reason, antenatal groups that continue into the postnatal period offer midwives a wonderful opportunity to help mothers and fathers cope with problems that could only be dimly anticipated antenatally. Information about infant feeding, sleeping, weaning and emotional development becomes immediately relevant in the postnatal period. Listening to the stories of people whom parents have already met in their antenatal group provides a wonderful way of normalizing experiences. The ideal therefore is to move away from antenatal education to one of transition to parenthood education, with sessions starting from mid-pregnancy and continuing into the first $3-6$ months of the babies’ lives. While this may sound utopian, it would be reasonable to argue that this level of support might well reduce demands on community midwives, specialist community public health nurses (health visitors) and General Practitioners (GPs), and lead to a reduction in the incidence of mental ill health and relationship breakdown following childbirth. One study (Nolan et al 2012) has noted that women can manage anxiety about their baby’s development if they can ‘compare notes’ with other women and gain a broad concept of what is ‘normal’.</p>
                        <p>The length of individual sessions may well be determined by the availability of the venue. Shorter sessions may be more tolerable for heavily pregnant women and tired fathers, but whatever the length of the session, it is important to recognize certain key features of adult learning. The average attention span of an adult is about 10 minutes. This means that activities, discussions and information-giving that continue for longer than this may result in a diminishing return as far as learning is concerned. In order to retain people’s interest, every session needs a variety of learning opportunities and the leader needs to set a pace that is acceptable to both activists and reflectors (Honey and Mumford 1982).</p>
                        <p>The brain needs water, glucose and protein in order to be able to function. A break half way through the session allows time for parents to socialize and to have a drink and something to eat - thus enhancing attention and learning power when they return to the group.</p>
                        <p>The aim of the group leader is to achieve a number of balances in each session:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>between her doing the talking and the mothers and fathers doing the talking</li>
                            <li>between people sitting in their seats and moving around</li>
                            <li>between work done with the whole group and work done in small groups</li>
                            <li>between single-sex small group work and mixed small group work</li>
                            <li>between focusing on themes to do with pregnancy and birth and those to do with living with a new baby</li>
                            <li>between group participants determining the agenda and how long to give to each topic, and the group leader leading the session.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Effective evaluation of any session could be carried out using the bullet-point list above. However, in order to see herself as group members are seeing her, it is important for the group leader to have a skilled outsider present at her sessions occasionally, someone who can give detailed feedback on which she can build so as to provide evermore effective learning opportunities.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>It is anticipated that antenatal education will once again become widespread throughout the UK, be properly funded, valued by midwives and valuable to mothers and fathers. While there are many questions for midwives to answer in terms of how best to provide sessions that will be relevant and useful to mothers and fathers from the communities they serve, what potential group participants want is very clear.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They want sessions that cover a variety of topics from pregnancy to birth to feeding and caring for their babies and looking after themselves.</li>
                            <li>They do not want just one class that is rushed and does not answer their questions.</li>
                            <li>They want to be part of a small group where they can make friends.</li>
                            <li>They do not want huge numbers at classes because they do not feel able to ask questions and cannot interact with other people.</li>
                            <li>They want group leaders to use up-to-date videos and teaching aids that help them prepare for labour, birth and parenting in the 21st century.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Mothers and fathers are very quick to spot poor facilitation skills and biased teaching. This places a requirement upon midwife lecturers to ensure that their students acquire group skills during their pre-registration or postregistration programmes.</p>
                        <p>The best classes, in the view of mothers and fathers:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>are where the facilitator respects their right to make up their own minds about what they want in labour and how they will care for their babies;</li>
                            <li>welcome questions;</li>
                            <li>provide lots of opportunities for talking;</li>
                            <li>provide information in a way that empowers them rather than frightening them; and</li>
                            <li>are structured, responsive to their individual needs, relaxed and fun (based on Nolan 2008).</li>
                        </ul>
