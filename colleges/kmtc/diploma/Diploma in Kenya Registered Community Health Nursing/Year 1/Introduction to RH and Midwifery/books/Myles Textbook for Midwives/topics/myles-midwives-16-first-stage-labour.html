                        <p>Birth is a dynamic and transforming experience, both on an individual and a societal level, and has the power to profoundly affect the lives of those involved. It is a physiological process characterized by non-intervention, a supportive environment and empowerment of the woman (Lavender et al 2009; Walsh 2012).</p>
                        <p>The midwife is a key figure in this process, supporting and assisting women safely through childbirth, recognizing the woman's needs and wellbeing are central rather than the needs of the maternity service. Consequently, the midwife is required to be a caring supporter, advocate, skilled practitioner, vigilant observer and an accurate recorder of facts. Women have differing needs and the way they approach and experience birth is unique and will depend on a number of factors, including cultural background, education, personal beliefs and previous life experience. In order to meet these varying needs, the midwife should possess wide-ranging skills and knowledge and have the willingness to place the woman at the centre of the care that is provided for her. Women and their chosen birth companion(s) should have an equal partnership with health professionals in all decision-making processes, so that they can make informed choices about their own labours and births.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A human pregnancy is considered to last approximately 40 weeks, with labour usually occurring between 37 and 42 weeks' gestation (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE] 2007) (see Chapter 9). Complex physiological and psychological changes occur during the last few weeks of pregnancy, and also during the onset of labour, that prepare the woman for the process of labour and birth (Howie and Novak 2010; McNabb 2011; Walsh 2012) (see Chapter 9).</p>
                        <p>Labour, purely in the physical sense, may be described as the process by which the fetus, placenta and membranes are expelled through the birth canal; however, labour is much more than a purely physical event. What happens during labour can affect the relationship between the mother and baby and can influence the likelihood and/or experience of future pregnancies.</p>
                        <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines normal labour as one that is low risk throughout, spontaneous in onset with the fetus presenting by the vertex, culminating in the mother and infant being in good condition following birth (WHO 1999). However, a labour where the fetus is presenting by the breech with no other risk factors should also be considered normal (Burvill 2005). Furthermore, all definitions of labour appear to be purely physiological and do not encompass the psychological wellbeing of the woman.</p>
                        <p>Traditionally, three stages of labour are described: the first, second and third stage, but this is a rather pedantic view, as labour is obviously a continuous process. It has also been acknowledged that there are more than three stages of labour, namely the latent, active and transitional phases, and these not only encompass specific physical changes but should also account for the emotional effects observed in women during this time.</p>
                        <p>Labour for each woman has its own unique ebbs and flows. Walsh (2010a) describes this as labour rhythms. However, as labour tends to be described and recognized universally as having distinct stages of labour, this approach will be adopted for the purposes of this text. The first stage of labour is usually recognized by the onset of regular uterine contractions, an accompanying effacement and at least 4 cm dilatation of the cervix and finally culminates in full dilatation of the cervix (NICE 2007; Howie and Rankin 2010).</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-2" class="section-heading">THE ONSET OF SPONTANEOUS PHYSIOLOGICAL LABOUR</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The onset of labour is determined by a complex interaction of maternal and fetal hormones and is not fully understood. It would appear to be multifactorial in origin, being a combination of hormonal and mechanical factors. Levels of maternal oestrogen rise sharply during the last weeks of pregnancy, resulting in changes that overcome the inhibiting effects of progesterone. High levels of oestrogens cause uterine muscle fibres to display oxytocic receptors and form gap junctions with each other. Oestrogen also stimulates the placenta to release prostaglandins that induce a production of enzymes that will digest collagen in the cervix, helping it to soften (Tortora and Grabowski 2011). The process is unclear but it is thought that both fetal and placental factors are involved. There is no clear evidence that concentrations of oestrogens and progesterone alter at the onset of labour, but the balance between them does facilitate myometrial activity. Uterine activity may also result from mechanical stimulation of the uterus and cervix. This may be brought about by overstretching, as in the case of a multiple pregnancy, or pressure from a presenting part that is well applied to the cervix (Impey and Child 2012).</p>
                        <h3>Recognition of the onset of labour</h3>
                        <p>The onset of labour is a process, not an event; therefore it is very difficult to identify exactly when the painless (sometimes painful) contractions of prelabour develop into the progressive rhythmic contractions of established labour. Diagnosing the onset of labour is extremely important, since it is on the basis of this finding that decisions are made that will affect the intrapartum care and support subsequently provided (NICE 2007; Zhang et al 2010).</p>
                        <p>It is part of the role of the midwife to ensure that women have sufficient information to assist them in recognizing the onset of established labour. This information is also needed to enable women to make informed choices based on current and unbiased evidence. The complex physical, psychological and emotional experience of labour affects every woman differently and midwives must have sound knowledge and experience to enable the woman to maintain control over the birth of her baby. Women in labour should be encouraged to trust their own instincts, listen to their own body and verbalize feelings in order to receive the help and support they require. Anxiety can increase the production of adrenaline (epinephrine), which inhibits uterine activity and may in turn prolong labour (Simkin and Ancheta 2011).</p>
                        <p>Irrespective of whether they have given birth before, many women experience contractions before the onset of labour which may be painful and regular for a time, causing them to think that labour has started. Furthermore, some women's lived experiences of early labour report prolonged contractions or being in labour for days and thus it is important to note that the discomfort or even pain that the woman is conscious of is genuine to her. Although the contractions that the woman is experiencing are real, they have yet to settle into the rhythmic pattern of established labour, resulting in effacement and dilatation of the cervix. Using terminology such as spurious or false labour is unhelpful and typically negative in terms of women's genuine experiences of early labour (Walsh 2012). Reassurance should be given and discussion of this potential situation earlier in the pregnancy can enable the woman and her partner to prepare for labour more effectively. Contact with the midwife should be made when regular, rhythmic, uterine contractions are experienced, and these are perceived by the woman as uncomfortable or painful.</p>
                        <h3>Latent phase of labour</h3>
                        <p>The latent phase of labour is prior to the active phase stage of labour and may last 6-8 hours in primigravidae when the cervix dilates from 0 cm to 4 cm dilated (Howie and Rankin 2010), although McDonald (2010) argues that the latent phase of labour is so subjective and poorly understood that a normal range is difficult to measure. According to Mukhopadhyay and Fraser (2009) the cervical canal shortens from 3 cm long to <0.5 cm in length during this time.</p>
                        <p>A woman may believe herself to be labouring, whereas sound midwifery judgement and understanding of the physiology of the first stage of labour may lead the midwife to the diagnosis of the latent phase of labour. Both the woman and midwife being aware of the latent phase of labour, and allowing this time to pass with no intervention, can prevent the medical diagnosis of poor progress or failure to progress later in labour. In a hospital setting, it is good practice not to commence the partogram until active labour has commenced. Assessing the active phase of labour has been highlighted as essential in reducing interventions in normal labour (Lauzon and Hodnett 2009).</p>
                        <h3>Active phase of labour</h3>
                        <p>The active phase within the first stage of labour is the time when the cervix usually undergoes more rapid dilatation. This begins when the cervix is at least 4 cm dilated and, in the presence of rhythmic contractions, progressively dilates to 10 cm or full dilatation.</p>
                        <p>When in labour, contractions will often be accompanied or preceded by a bloodstained mucoid show: that is, the release of the operculum from the cervical canal as effacement and dilatation progresses. Occasionally, the membranes will rupture, at which stage the midwife may seek assurance that there are no significant changes in the fetal heart rate due to the rare complication of cord prolapse and that meconium is not present in the liquor, indicating fetal compromise.</p>
                        <h3>Transitional phase of labour</h3>
                        <p>The transitional phase of the first stage of labour is from when the cervix is around 8 cm dilated until it is fully dilated or until expulsive contractions associated with the second stage of labour are felt by the woman. There is often a brief lull in the intensity of uterine activity at this time. Many women may feel the urge to push during transition. In addition to physiological responses, women can experience a range of experiences and emotions. Woods (2006) describes this as being from inner calm to acute distress. The woman may verbalize her distress, direct it at her birth partner(s), alternatively she may be quiet and contemplative.</p>

                        <h3>Duration</h3>
                        <p>The length of labour varies widely and is influenced by parity, birth interval, psychological state, presentation and position of the fetus. Maternal pelvic shape and size and the character of uterine contractions also affect timescale.</p>
                        <p>By far the greatest part of labour is taken up by the first stage and it is common to expect the active phase to be completed within 6-12 hours (Tortora and Grabowski 2011). Over the years there has been much debate surrounding the length of physiological active labour in low-risk populations of childbearing women to refute the original claim of Friedman (1954) that cervical dilatation occurred at the rate of 1 cm per hour (Albers 1999; Lavender et al 2006; Zhang et al 2010). A cervical dilatation rate of 0.5 cm per hour, however, has now been incorporated into the NICE (2007) intrapartum guidelines as being within the parameters of normal labour.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Cervical effacement</h3>
                        <p>Effacement refers to the inclusion (taking up) of the cervical canal into the lower uterine segment. It is believed that this process takes place from above downward, meaning that the muscle fibres surrounding the internal os are drawn upwards by the retracted upper segment and the cervix merges into the lower uterine segment. The cervical canal widens at the level of the internal os, whereas the state of the external os remains unchanged (Cunningham et al 2010) (Fig. 16.1).</p>
                        <p>Effacement may occur late in pregnancy, or it may not take place until labour begins. In the nulliparous woman the cervix will not usually dilate until effacement is complete, whereas in the multiparous woman, effacement and dilatation usually occurs simultaneously and a small canal may be felt in early labour. This is often referred to by midwives as a multips os (Howie and Rankin 2010).</p>

                        <h3>Cervical dilatation</h3>
                        <p>Dilatation of the cervix is the process of enlargement of the os uteri from a tightly closed aperture to an opening large enough to permit passage of the fetus. Dilatation is assessed in centimetres and full dilatation at term equates to about 10 cm. However, acknowledging that all women are different sizes and shapes means that full cervical dilatation may be between 9 and 11 cm in individual women (Walsh 2012).</p>
                        <p>Dilatation occurs as a result of uterine action and the counter-pressure applied by either the intact bag of membranes or the presenting part, or both. A well-flexed fetal head closely applied to the cervix favours efficient dilatation. Pressure applied evenly to the cervix causes the uterine fundus to respond by contraction and retraction, often referred to as the Ferguson reflex (Howie and Rankin 2010).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Uterine action</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Fundal dominance (Fig. 16.2)</h4>
                        <p>Each uterine contraction commences in the fundus near one of the cornua and spreads across and downwards. The contraction lasts longest in the fundus, where it is also most intense, but the peak is reached simultaneously over the whole uterus and the contraction fades from all parts together. This pattern permits the cervix to dilate and the strongly contracting fundus to eventually expel the fetus at the end of labour (Howie and Rankin 2010).</p>

                        <h4>Polarity</h4>
                        <p>Polarity is the term used to describe the neuromuscular harmony that prevails between the two poles or segments of the uterus throughout labour. During each uterine contraction, these two poles act harmoniously. The upper pole contracts strongly and retracts to expel the fetus; the lower pole contracts slightly and dilates to allow expulsion to take place. If polarity is disorganized then the progress of labour is inhibited (Bernal and Norwitz 2012).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Contraction and retraction</h4>
                        <p>Uterine muscle has a unique property. During labour the contraction does not pass off entirely, as muscle fibres retain some of the shortening of contraction instead of becoming completely relaxed (Fig. 16.3). This is termed retraction. This process assists in the progressive expulsion of the fetus, such that the upper segment of the uterus becomes gradually shorter and thicker and its cavity diminishes.</p>

                        <h4>Intensity and resting tone</h4>
                        <p>Each labour is individual and does not always conform to expectations, but generally before labour becomes established, uterine contractions may occur every 15-20 minutes, lasting for about 30 seconds. They are often fairly weak and may even be imperceptible to the woman. The contractions usually occur with rhythmic regularity and the intervals between them where the muscle relaxes (resting tone) gradually lessen while the length and strength gradually intensifies through the latent phase and into the active phase of the first stage of labour. By the end of the first stage, the contractions may occur at 2-3 minute intervals, last for 50-60 seconds and are very powerful (Cunningham et al 2010).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Formation of upper and lower uterine segments</h4>
                        <p>By the end of pregnancy, the body of the uterus is described as having divided into two segments, which are anatomically distinct (Fig. 16.4). The upper uterine segment, having been formed from the body of the fundus, is mainly concerned with contraction and retraction, and is thick and muscular. The lower uterine segment is formed of the isthmus and the cervix, and is about 8-10 cm in length. The lower segment is prepared for distension and dilatation. Although there is no clear and strict division of these two segments, the muscle content reduces from the fundus to the cervix, where it is thinner. When labour begins, the retracted longitudinal fibres in the upper segment pull on the lower segment causing it to stretch. This is aided by the force applied by the descending presenting part (Howie and Rankin 2010; Impey and Child 2012).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_28_c51b551507f57ce861a5g-350-3.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the birth canal before labour begins, illustrating the distinction between the upper and lower uterine segments." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h4>The retraction ring</h4>
                        <p>A ridge develops between the upper and lower uterine segments, known as the retraction ring (Fig. 16.5). The physiological retraction ring gradually rises as the upper uterine segment contracts and retracts and the lower uterine segment thins out to accommodate the descending fetus. Once the cervix is fully dilated and the fetus can leave the uterus, the retraction ring rises no further.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_28_c51b551507f57ce861a5g-351-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the retraction ring (R) located between the upper and lower uterine segments." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>However, in extreme cases of mechanically obstructed labour, this physiological retraction ring becomes visible above the symphysis pubis and is described as Bandl's ring. A Bandl's ring may consequently be associated with fetal compromise (Lauria et al 2007).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Show</h4>
                        <p>As a result of the dilatation of the cervix, the operculum, which formed the cervical plug during pregnancy, is released. The woman may observe a bloodstained mucoid discharge a few hours before, or within a few hours after, labour commences. The blood comes from ruptured capillaries in the parietal decidua where the chorion has become detached from the dilating cervix and should only be a staining (Impey and Child 2012). Frank, fresh bleeding is atypical at this stage, although during the transitional phase and as the first stage ends, there is often a small loss of bright red blood that heralds the second stage of labour. Both occurrences may be referred to as a show.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Mechanical factors</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Formation of the forewaters and hindwaters</h4>
                        <p>As the lower uterine segment forms and stretches, the chorion becomes detached from it and the increased intrauterine pressure causes this loosened part of the sac of fluid to bulge downwards into the internal os, to the depth of 6-12 mm. The well-flexed fetal head fits snugly into the cervix and cuts off the amniotic fluid in front of the head from that which surrounds the body, forming two separate pools of fluid. The former is known as the forewaters and the latter, the hindwaters. In early labour it is often possible to feel intact forewaters bulging even when the hindwaters have ruptured, making ruptured membranes a difficult diagnosis at times.</p>
                        <p>The effect of separation of the forewaters prevents the pressure that is applied to the hindwaters during uterine contractions from being applied to the forewaters. This may help keep the membranes intact during the first stage of labour and be a natural defence against ascending infection (Bernal and Norwitz 2012).</p>
                        
                        <h4>General fluid pressure</h4>
                        <p>While the membranes remain intact, the pressure of the uterine contractions is exerted on the amniotic fluid and, as fluid is not compressible, the pressure is equalized throughout the uterus and over the fetal body, known as general fluid pressure (Fig. 16.6). When the membranes rupture and a quantity of fluid emerges, the fetal head, the placenta and umbilical cord are compressed between the uterine wall and the fetus during contractions with a consequential reduction in the oxygen supply to the fetus. Preserving the integrity of the membranes, therefore, optimizes the oxygen supply to the fetus and also helps to prevent intrauterine and fetal infection (Howie and Rankin 2010).</p>

                        <h4>Rupture of the membranes</h4>
                        <p>The optimum physiological time for the membranes to rupture spontaneously is at the end of the first stage of labour, after the cervix becomes fully dilated and no longer supports the bag of forewaters. The uterine contractions are also applying increasing expulsive force at this time.</p>
                        <p>The membranes may sometimes rupture days before labour begins or during the first stage. If for any reason there is a badly fitting presenting part and the forewaters are not separated effectively then the membranes may rupture early. However, in most cases there is no apparent reason for early spontaneous membrane rupture. Occasionally the membranes do not rupture even in the second stage and appear at the vulva as a bulging sac covering the fetal head as it is born; this is known as the caul.</p>
                        <p>Early rupture of membranes may lead to an increased incidence of variable decelerations on cardiotocography (CTG), resulting in an increase in caesarean sections if fetal blood sampling is not available (Alfirevic et al 2013). A systematic review found that routine artificial rupture of membranes (ARM) does not significantly reduce the length of labour and thus routine amniotomy should not be performed (Smyth et al 2007). However, there was some evidence that ARM increased the rate of caesarean section but this finding did not reach significance. All women are required to give consent for this intervention and the midwife should have a clear indication for performing an ARM: details of which should be recorded in the woman's labour records (Nursing and Midwifery Council [NMC] 2009, 2012).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Fetal axis pressure</h4>
                        <p>During each contraction, the uterus rises forward and the force of the fundal contraction is transmitted to the upper pole of the fetus, down the long axis of the fetus and applied by the presenting part to the cervix. This is known as fetal axis pressure (Fig. 16.7) and becomes much more significant after rupture of the membranes and during the second stage of labour.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-4" class="section-heading">RECOGNITION OF THE FIRST STAGE OF LABOUR</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>It is the woman herself who usually diagnoses the onset of normal labour and many women and their partners are apprehensive in case the labour is very quick, resulting in an unattended birth. Education during pregnancy is important to enable the woman to recognize the beginning of labour and understand the latent phase in order to consider possible strategies she may use for labour and birth.</p>
                        <p>Women should appreciate that in late pregnancy vaginal secretions without any bloodstaining increase. In addition, they should be aware that a show, which is usually a pink or bloodstained jelly-like loss, prior to the onset of labour or in early labour, is quite common. If a woman is examined vaginally in late pregnancy they should also be informed that there may be some slight blood loss after the procedure.</p>
                        <p>Braxton Hicks contractions are more noticeable in late pregnancy and some women experience them as painful. They are usually irregular or their regularity is not maintained for long spells of time, seldom lasting more than one minute. In active labour, contractions exhibit a pattern of rhythm and regularity, usually increasing in length, strength and frequency as time goes on. When the woman first feels contractions she may be aware only of backache, but if she places a hand on her abdomen she may perceive simultaneous hardening of the uterus. If the pregnancy has been problem-free, with a normal birth anticipated, the midwife should advise the woman to stay in her own surroundings, continue with her normal activities, to eat, be active and upright.</p>
                        <p>It is sometimes difficult to be certain whether or not the membranes have ruptured spontaneously prior to labour or in early labour. The woman may be experiencing some degree of stress incontinence, so she may be unsure if it is liquor or urine that she is passing. If there is any doubt, the woman should contact her midwife who may decide to insert a speculum into the vagina to observe for any amniotic fluid. Digital examination should be avoided if the woman is not in labour as it can increase the risk of ascending infection (Shepherd et al 2010).</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-5" class="section-heading">INITIAL MEETING WITH THE MIDWIFE</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Ideally, the woman should know her own midwife and be able to contact her when labour starts. Where this is not possible, it is crucial that the first meeting between the midwife, the labouring woman and her partner establishes a rapport, which sets the scene for the remainder of labour. If the woman is planning to birth in hospital, she may worry about the reception she and her companion will receive and the attitude of the people attending her. In addition, an unfamiliar environment may provoke feelings of vulnerability and undermine her confidence. Comfortable surroundings, a welcoming manner and a midwife who greets the woman as an equal in a partnership will engender feelings of mutual respect, thus enabling the woman to relax and respond positively to the amazing forces of labour and to her baby after it is born (Berry 2006; Fisher et al 2006; Raynor and England 2010).</p>
                        
                        <h3>The language of childbirth</h3>
                        <p>It has been recognized that some of the childbirth terminology used when communicating with women appears medical, masculine and negative (Robertson 2003). The terms pain and labour are suggestive of difficulty and trouble. It is therefore vital the midwife observes what she says to women during childbirth and uses appropriate and adapted language which is woman-friendly. The word delivery has been replaced by the term birthing or birth as these appear more suitable when discussing the concept and practice of normality within midwifery.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Communication</h3>
                        <p>The key issues for women relate to achieving a safe birth, feeling in control within the birth environment, developing supportive relationships with their carers, and being treated with kindness, respect, dignity and cultural sensitivity if they are to realize a positive experience of birth (Helman 2007; Main and Bingham 2008; Redshaw and Heikkila 2010). Effective communication between the midwife and the woman and her partner, and with other clinicians in the multidisciplinary team, is essential to providing effective safe supportive care in labour and achieving the woman's objectives (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [RCOG] 2008). Communication does not consist only of the content of what is said, but also includes non-verbal communication and written records, such as the woman's birth plan.</p>
                        <p>Poor communication is the commonest cause of preventable adverse outcomes in hospitals and remains a significant cause of written complaints (Health and Social Care Information Centre 2012). An inquiry conducted by the Kings Fund into the safety of birth in England concluded that the overwhelming majority of births are safe but when there are increased risks to the woman or baby, that render some births less safe, functioning teams are the key to improving the outcome for the woman and baby (Kings Fund 2008).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Interpreting services</h4>
                        <p>If the woman and midwife are unable to understand each other, communication will be ineffective and it is essential that adequate interpretation services are available when necessary. Although there is a tendency to rely on family members or friends to provide interpreting services, the use of such interpreters is deemed inappropriate when the midwife wishes to discuss sensitive issues such as past history, domestic abuse or the need for interventions. Wherever possible, professional interpretation services should be provided for all non-English-speaking women (Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries [CMACE] 2011). If a face-to-face interpreter cannot be obtained, then the use of a telephone or Internet interpretation service should be considered.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Birth plan</h4>
                        <p>Regardless of where the woman plans to give birth, a birth plan is a valuable tool for midwives to observe and use to facilitate the provision of holistic, individualized care. This is especially so in situations where the maternity care is fragmented and the woman first encounters the midwife who will be caring for her in labour when she attends the hospital to give birth. The birth plan therefore provides the opportunity for the midwife to discuss with each woman and her partner any plans about the type of birth they would like that they may have already prepared with support from their community midwife. An outline may be present in the case notes, or the couple may bring a birth plan with them. Frequently, the partner is involved in this forward planning, which should be a flexible proposal that can be reviewed and revised as labour progresses (Department of Health [DH] 2007). Some women, however, may not have prepared a birth plan and so the midwife should encourage them to consider any preferences that they may have, for example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>her choice of birth companion(s)</li>
                            <li>her choice of clothes for labour</li>
                            <li>ambulation and fetal monitoring (intermittent, electronic or a combination)</li>
                            <li>strategies for labour (water immersion, massage, pharmacological pain relief)</li>
                            <li>position for labour and birth</li>
                            <li>expectant or actively managed third stage of labour</li>
                            <li>cutting of the umbilical cord</li>
                            <li>skin-to-skin contact and feeding the baby after birth.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Having the opportunity to discuss such issues in early labour enables the establishment of a trusting relationship between the woman and the midwife to develop where the woman feels valued and involved in intrapartum decision-making: all details of which should be clearly documented in the intrapartum records (NMC 2009, 2012).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Emotional and psychological care</h3>
                        <p>When a woman begins to labour, she may have a mixture of emotions. Most women anticipate labour with a degree of excitement, anxiety, fear and hope. Many other emotions are influenced by cultural expectations and previous life experiences. The state of the woman's knowledge, her fears and expectations are also influenced by her companions during labour, including the attitude and behaviour of the caregiver.</p>
                        <p>By the time labour starts, a decision will already have been reached about where the woman plans to give birth. Some women may choose to give birth at home, some in a midwife-led unit/birthing centre and others in hospital. Some women may also wish to labour as long as possible at home but give birth in hospital. Whatever choice the woman makes, she must be the focus of the care, able to feel she is in control of what is happening and contributing to the decisions made about her care (Sinivaara et al 2004; DH 2007). Hodnett et al (2012) assert that there is a powerful effect on maternal birth satisfaction and labour progress where women feel in control and involved in decision making.</p>
                        <p>Providing that there are no complications and labour is not well advanced, the woman may remain at home as long as she feels comfortable and confident. If labour commences prior to term, however, admission to hospital is always advised (Chapter 12).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Companion in labour</h4>
                        <p>The fact that women should be encouraged to have support by birth partners of their choice is well recognized (NICE 2007; Midwives Information Resource Service [MIDIRS] 2008a). The woman herself is central to all the decisions made about care during labour and her chosen companion, whether sexual partner, friend or family member, should understand this. Ideally the companion should be involved in prelabour preparation and decision-making, have participated in compiling a birth plan and be aware of all the available options.</p>
                        <p>If the woman is giving birth in hospital, admission to a labour ward can be an alienating experience and the company of a supportive companion can help reduce anxiety. During labour, the companion should be made to feel useful and part of the team by the midwife, as they too may be feeling anxious (Longworth and Kingdon 2010). Such activities may include massaging the woman's back, offering drinks, assisting with breathing and relaxation awareness and supporting her decisions regarding her strategies for working with, or controlling, pain.</p>
                        <p>In some cases a midwife will be able to remain with one woman through her entire labour, but due to the unpredictable workloads and staffing levels this is not always possible. This can leave the woman feeling unsupported and processed, rather than cared for and can have profound negative effects on a woman's satisfaction and memory of the birth (Kirkham 2011). Despite such constraints it is not appropriate to use the birth partner as a substitute for close observation and attendance by the midwife. Equally so, the midwife should also recognize the need for the couple to have some personal space and leave them alone, albeit with the means to summon assistance should it be required. This would not be acceptable, however, when labour is well advanced, as being left alone could prove very frightening for the woman and her partner.</p>
                        <p>It would be a mistake to consider that all women have the same requirements, however, women have varying needs, with some preferring presence and others preferring complete privacy. The task for the midwife is to provide the individualized service that ensures that the woman feels safe and supported. Despite the aim to provide a good outcome for the woman, there is no doubt that a proportion of women are dissatisfied with the birthing experience and some are positively traumatized by their experience (Ayers et al 2008).</p>
                        <p>It is also important to ensure that support is available to the partner when it is needed if the woman is in significant pain or a sudden emergency develops and they are encouraged to take short breaks during a prolonged labour. If a caesarean section becomes necessary, the midwife should delegate someone to keep the partner informed so they are not left feeling abandoned or uncared for.</p>
                        
                        <h4>The concept of continuous support in labour</h4>
                        <p>There is evidence that the presence of the midwife and one-to-one personal attention is positively associated with a woman's satisfaction with her care. Kennedy et al (2010) describe that the presence and demeanour of the midwife can enhance the woman's trust in her own ability to cope. In a systematic review by Hodnett et al (2011), the value of continuous support during labour and birth is clearly evident. The review, consisting of 21 randomized clinical trials, involving over 15000 women, showed evidence that women who laboured with continuous support had shorter labours and were less likely to experience intrapartum interventions. These women were also less likely to have an epidural or other forms of pain medication, give birth by caesarean section, ventouse or forceps and consequently appeared more satisfied with their overall experience of childbirth (Hodnett et al 2011). These outcomes have been further strengthened by the results of Sandall et al (2013), who collected data from 13 trials culminating in the birth outcomes of 16242 women. It was found that where women received midwife-led care throughout pregnancy and birth from a small group of midwives they were less likely to give birth prematurely or require interventions in labour than those women who received care based on a shared care model or medical model. Consequently Sandall et al (2013) affirm that all women should be offered midwife-led continuity of care unless they have serious medical or obstetric complications and women should be encouraged to ask for this option.</p>
                        <p>The essence of midwifery is to be with woman, providing comfort and support to women in labour. Although the midwife has an important role to play in providing support and care, there is evidence that a birth partner who is neither from the woman's social network or a member of the midwifery team, such as a doula, can provide the most effective continuous support during labour, resulting in less interventions and pain medication and an increase in positive childbirth experiences (Hodnett et al 2011).</p>
                        
                        <h4>The physical environment</h4>
                        <p>In the developed world most births occur in hospital and therefore the atmosphere and environment of hospital birthing rooms are important (Sullivan and McCormick 2007). The clinical appearance of hospital birthing rooms, coupled with associated clinical regimes and loss of privacy, can alienate women and lead to feelings of loss of control (Marshall et al 2011). In turn, this loss of control can interfere with the normal physiological process of labour (Walsh 2010a, 2010b).</p>
                        <p>Whilst there has been an effort by hospitals to provide a less clinical and more home-from-home environment for birth, there has been some criticism in that such adaptations create an artificial situation whereby homeliness masks the unchanged clinical agenda and professional dominance found in traditional labour environments (Fannon 2003). Although evidence is limited, Hodnett et al (2009) found that efforts to make birthing rooms more homely are appreciated by women and can have a positive effect on them and their care providers. However, such an environment is unlikely on its own to improve birth outcomes or the birthing experience.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Reducing the risk of infection</h4>
                        <p>In the latest Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths report, the leading cause of direct deaths during the triennium 2006-2008, was sepsis, accounting for 26 deaths (Harper 2011). As a consequence, the prevention of infection was one of the top 10 recommendations from the report. In addition, health care-associated infections (HCAIs) have become the subject of considerable public interest as a consequence of the rise in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). With the introduction of a national strategy to reduce the rates of MRSA and C. difficile, there is evidence that the rates of both types of infection have more than halved (National Patient Safety Agency [NPSA] 2007a, 2007b; National Audit Office 2009).</p>
                        <p>Hand hygiene, the combination of processes including hand washing, the use of alcohol hand rub and carefully drying and caring for the skin and nails, is considered to be the single most important measure in preventing the spread of infection. Hand washing will remove transient microorganisms and render the hands socially clean, however, evidence suggests that the process of hand washing is poorly performed and therefore less effective than it otherwise could be. Prior to and immediately following any direct contact with the woman or baby and their immediate surroundings or after an exposure risk to any body fluids, effective hand hygiene practices as determined by WHO (2009) should be followed.</p>
                        <p>A clean environment is essential if infection rates are to be kept to a minimum and the midwife has an important role to play in ensuring that all equipment is cleaned according to local Trust guidelines and that there is adherence to all infection control measures. Rooms, birthing pools, beds and any equipment used by the midwife should be effectively cleaned before use.</p>
                        <p>When a woman is admitted to hospital, invasive procedures should be kept to a minimum as an intact skin provides an excellent barrier to organisms. Ideally, women should spend as little time in hospital as determined by their individual needs to minimize their exposure risk to infection. The fetal membranes should also be preserved intact unless there is a positive indication for their rupture that would outweigh the advantage of their protective functions (NICE 2007). Certain invasive techniques, such as the performance of vaginal examinations, may be deemed necessary during labour, however the midwife should ensure that she has a sound reason before embarking on any procedure. Women whose labour is prolonged are at particular risk of infection, often being subjected to a number of invasive procedures including the administration of intravenous fluids, repeated vaginal examinations, epidural analgesia and fetal blood sampling, all of which will increase the risk of infection. By adhering to infection control policies and minimizing interventions when required, the midwife should reduce the potential risk of infection to the woman and promote safety.</p>
                        <p>The midwife is encouraged to use personal protective equipment if she assesses that there is a risk of transmission of microorganisms to the woman, or the risk of contamination of her clothing and skin by the woman's body fluids (NICE 2007). This poses a difficulty for the midwife as every birth presents a risk of cross-contamination, but wearing a full gown, face masks and eye goggles can create an artificial barrier between herself and the labouring woman at a time when a relationship of trust is vital. Furthermore, face masks and eye goggles provide limited protection from spills or inhalation of spray. In most instances, appropriate hand hygiene and the use of single-use sterile gloves will be sufficient to reduce cross-contamination (NICE 2007).</p>
                        
                        <h3>The midwife's initial physical examination of the woman</h3>
                        <p>The initial examination should include a discussion with the woman about when labour commenced, whether the membranes have ruptured and the frequency and strength of the contractions. The midwife should be aware that the woman will be very conscious of her body and may be unable to concentrate on the conversation or respond while experiencing a contraction. Since the woman has embarked on an intensely energy-demanding process, enquiry should be made about her ability to sleep and her most recent intake of food. If she is in early labour and there are no concerns about the pregnancy, the woman should be advised she can eat and drink as she wishes, remain mobile and maybe bathe if she would find this relaxing. Consideration should be given to the woman's social circumstances, including the care of other children and whether a birthing partner is available and has been contacted.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Past history</h4>
                        <p>Of particular relevance at the onset of a woman's labour are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the contents of the birth plan</li>
                            <li>her parity and age</li>
                            <li>the gestational age and outcomes of previous labours</li>
                            <li>the weights and condition of previous babies</li>
                            <li>her blood results including grouping, Rhesus factor and haemoglobin</li>
                            <li>her attendance at any specialist clinics</li>
                            <li>evidence of any known problems: social or physical.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Consent</h4>
                        <p>Prior to touching the woman, a sound explanation of the proposed examination and their significance should be given. Verbal consent should be obtained and recorded in the notes (NMC 2008, 2009). The midwife must be aware that a competent woman, with a capacity to make decisions, is within her rights to refuse any treatment regardless of the consequences to her and her unborn baby and does not have to give a reason (DH 2009). Should the midwife be providing care to a pregnant teenager under the age of 16 years, it is important to carefully assess whether there is evidence that she has sufficient understanding in order to give valid consent, i.e. complies with the Fraser guidelines, previously referred to as being Gillick competent (Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech AHA 1986; GMC 2013).</p>
                        
                        <h4>General assessment</h4>
                        <p>Initial observations form a baseline for further examinations carried out throughout labour. Basic observations, including pulse rate, temperature and blood pressure, are assessed and recorded. The woman's hands and feet are usually examined for signs of oedema. Slight swelling of the feet and ankles is physiological, but pre-tibial oedema or puffiness of the fingers or face is not.</p>
                        <p>A detailed abdominal examination including symphysis fundal height and optimum position for auscultation of the fetal heart, as described in Chapter 10, should be undertaken and recorded. The abdominal examination may be repeated at intervals in order to assess descent of the presenting part, whether it be cephalic or breech. This is measured by the number of fifths palpable above the pelvic brim and should be recorded on the partogram.</p>
                        <p>The fetal heart rate should be auscultated for a minimum of 1 minute immediately after a contraction using a Pinard stethoscope and the rate should be recorded as an average, in a single figure. The maternal pulse should be palpated to differentiate between maternal and fetal heart rates (NICE 2007). Although the Pinard stethoscope is recommended for the initial assessment of the fetal heart, this may not be suitable for use in women who are markedly obese or unable to remain still during auscultation. In such circumstances a hand-held Doppler may be used.</p>
                        <p>A vaginal examination (VE) may also be undertaken to help confirm the onset of labour and determine the extent of cervical effacement and dilatation (Fig. 16.8), with some women requesting it when seeking reassurance about the status of their labour. The procedure, however, is invasive, can be uncomfortable and also poses an infection risk.</p>

                        <h4>Records</h4>
                        <p>The midwife's record of labour is a legal document and must be kept meticulously. The records may be examined by any court for up to 25 years, or the Nursing and Midwifery Council's Professional Conduct Committee or Health Committee, and will be examined in the audit process of statutory supervision of midwifery or on behalf of the Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts (CNST) monitoring process. A summary of good record keeping is provided below (NMC 2009, 2012):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Records should be as contemporaneous as possible.</li>
                            <li>Each entry should be authenticated with the midwife's full signature with the name printed underneath.</li>
                            <li>Records should be comprehensive but concise and consist of the woman's observations, her physical, psychological and sociological state, and any problem that arises as well as the midwife's response and any subsequent interventions.</li>
                            <li>The records should be kept in chronological order as their accuracy provides the basis from which clinical improvements, progress or deterioration of the woman or fetus can be judged.</li>
                            <li>The record is shared between the midwife and obstetrician and details of any consultation with other members of the multiprofessional team should be clearly documented by the midwife, including the time and nature of the consultation.</li>
                            <li>The obstetrician is also responsible to record their findings, timing of visits and any prescriptions made as the same standards apply to all practitioners.</li>
                            <li>The midwife usually enters in the records the summary of labour and initial details about the health of the baby.</li>
                            <li>A midwife must ensure all records are stored securely and should not destroy or arrange for their destruction.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>The partogram or partograph</h4>
                        <p>In recent years the partogram or partograph has been widely accepted as an effective means of recording the progress of labour. It is a chart on which the salient features of labour are entered in a visual graphic form to provide the opportunity for early identification of deviations from normal (Fig. 16.9). However, Lavender et al (2008) found no evidence to support the routine use of the partogram in women who commenced labour spontaneously at term with regards to maternal and fetal outcomes in those labours where a partogram was used against those where there was no partogram. Nonetheless, the partogram remains an integral part of intrapartum record-keeping. The charts are usually designed to allow for recordings at 15-minute intervals and include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>fetal heart rate</li>
                            <li>maternal temperature, pulse and blood pressure</li>
                            <li>frequency and strength of contractions every 10 minutes</li>
                            <li>descent of the presenting part</li>
                            <li>cervical effacement and dilatation</li>
                            <li>colour of amniotic fluid</li>
                            <li>degree of caput succedaneum/moulding</li>
                            <li>fluid balance</li>
                            <li>urine analysis</li>
                            <li>drugs administered.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The cervicograph is the diagrammatic representation of the dilatation of the cervix charted against the hours in labour. Some initial studies (Friedman 1954; Pearson 1981) demonstrated that the cervical dilatation time of normal labour has a characteristic sigmoid curve. This curve can be divided into two distinct parts: the latent phase and the active phase. Women's progress in labour, however, does not fit neatly into predetermined criteria therefore rigid parameters of normal progress should not be adopted (Albers 1999; Lavender et al 2006). The rate of progress in labour must be considered in the context of the woman's total wellbeing and choice.</p>

                        <h3>Assessing progress</h3>
                        <p>Physical examination of the cervix is not the only way to assess labour. Midwives can use a range of skills, including visualization of the purple line, appearing from the woman's anal margin gradually extending to the nape of the buttocks (Hobbs 1998; Shepherd et al 2010), and observing the Rhombus of Michaelis, a kite-shaped area between the sacrum and ilea which becomes increasing visible as the fetal head descends in the pelvis (Shepherd et al 2010). In addition, the midwife should be vigilant in observing for changes in the woman's breathing, behaviour, noises, movements and posture alongside changes in the nature of contractions.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Abdominal examination</h4>
                        <p>An abdominal examination should be repeated by the midwife at intervals throughout labour in order to assess the length, strength and frequency of contractions and the descent of the presenting part. Palpation is of benefit prior to undertaking a vaginal examination, as the findings will assist the midwife to be accurate when defining the position and station of the head/breech. It is also useful to record the position of the fetus contemporaneously during the labour, as this can assist with the analysis of events should a shoulder dystocia occur (Brydon and Raynor 2012).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Contractions</h4>
                        <p>The frequency, length and strength of the contractions should be noted and recorded on the partogram, usually at 30 minute intervals. The uterus should always feel softer between contractions and failure to relax is evidence of hypertonicity. Hypertonicity is usually defined as a contraction lasting more than 2 minutes (NICE 2007). The contraction rate is usually assessed by counting the number of contractions in 10 minutes, over a 20-minute period. Evidence of five contractions or more in 10 minutes is evidence of tachysystole in spontaneous labour, or hyperstimulation in induced labour (Chapter 19). An excessive number of contractions or hypertonicity can result in fetal compromise as a result of prolonged cord compression or reduction in placental perfusion with consequent reduction in blood supply to the fetus.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Vaginal examination</h4>
                        <p>Although vaginal examinations (VE) have become a routine procedure in labour there is very little evidence to support their efficacy. Dixon and Foureur (2010) state that vaginal examinations are arguably considered to be both an intervention and an essential clinical assessment tool in labour. Midwives should remember that to women who have survived sexual abuse, experienced female genital mutilation (FGM), or are extremely anxious, a vaginal examination can be very distressing and sometimes impossible. Vaginal examinations are undertaken using aseptic principles and should be used judiciously when more information is required if this cannot be gleaned from external observations of women in labour. Ideally the same person should perform the vaginal examinations to be in a better position to judge any changes. Observations and findings as detailed in Box 16.1 should be noted and recorded accordingly by the midwife.</p>
                        <p>Generally, the trend has moved away from routine 4-hourly VE and justification for each examination should always be recorded. An explanation of the procedure, obtaining of verbal consent from the woman and an abdominal examination should always precede the VE (DH 2009). The woman's bladder should be empty as the presenting part may be displaced by a full bladder as well as being very uncomfortable for the woman. In order to obtain the most information, the woman is usually asked to lie on her back but the technique can be easily adapted to accommodate other positions that suit the woman better. During the examination the woman's dignity and privacy need to be considered. In order to avoid unnecessary exposure, the woman can be asked to move and uncover herself when the midwife is ready to commence the examination. Tap water may be used to cleanse the vagina for this procedure (NICE 2007). With the combination of external and internal findings, the skilled midwife should gain a detailed account of the labour and its subsequent progress.</p>

                        <h5>Indications for vaginal examination</h5>
                        <p>There should be valid reasons to undertake a VE in labour, which are to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>make a positive identification of the presentation</li>
                            <li>determine whether the head is engaged in case of doubt</li>
                            <li>ascertain whether the forewaters have ruptured, or to rupture them artificially</li>
                            <li>exclude cord prolapse after rupture of the forewaters, especially if there is an ill-fitting presenting part or there are fetal heart rate changes</li>
                            <li>assess progress or slow labour</li>
                            <li>confirm full dilatation of the cervix (see Fig. 16.12)</li>
                            <li>confirm the axis of the fetus and presentation of the second twin in a multiple pregnancy in order to rupture the second amniotic sac, if necessary.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Under no circumstances should a midwife make a vaginal examination if there is any frank bleeding unless the placenta is positively known to be in the upper uterine segment.</p>

                        <h3>Assessing the wellbeing of the woman</h3>
                        <h4>Maternal observations</h4>
                        <h5>Pulse rate</h5>
                        <p>A tachycardia can indicate pain or anxiety and is also associated with pyrexia, exhaustion and shock. The pulse rate should be recorded hourly (NICE 2007). If the rate increases to >100 bpm it may be indicative of anxiety, pain, infection, ketosis or haemorrhage. The pulse should also be assessed and recorded at any time that there is concern about fetal wellbeing or if there is uncertainty about whether the maternal rather than the fetal pulse is being recorded (NICE 2007).</p>
                        <h5>Temperature</h5>
                        <p>A rise in temperature can be indicative of infection or dehydration. The temperature should be recorded 4-hourly (NICE 2007) and additionally when there is a clinical indication.</p>
                        <h5>Blood pressure</h5>
                        <p>Hypotension may be caused by the woman being in the supine position, by shock or as a result of vasodilation associated with epidural anaesthesia. Hypertension is an indicator of pre-eclampsia and in cases where a woman has pre-eclampsia or essential hypertension during pregnancy, labour may further elevate the blood pressure.</p>
                        <p>Blood pressure should be measured every 4 hours (NICE 2007) and additionally when there is a clinical indication. It is usual practice to monitor the blood pressure at 5-minute intervals for 20 minutes following the administration of an epidural anaesthetic and following the administration of any bolus dose.</p>
                        <h5>Fluid balance and urinalysis</h5>
                        <p>A record should be kept of all urine passed in order to ensure that the bladder is being emptied. If an intravenous infusion is in progress, the fluids administered must be recorded accurately. It is particularly important to note how much fluid remains if a bag is changed when only partially used.</p>
                        <p>A trace of protein may be a contaminant following rupture of the membranes or a sign of a urinary tract infection, but more significant proteinuria may indicate pre-eclampsia. Urine passed during labour should be tested for ketones and protein. Ketones may occur in normal labour and a low level is very common and is not usually thought to be significant.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Cleanliness and comfort</h3>
                        <h4>Enemas and perineal shaving</h4>
                        <p>There is no evidence to support the routine procedure of administering enemas or undertaking perineal shave to women in labour. However, if a woman reports constipation, or the midwife detects that the rectum is full on vaginal examination, or if the woman feels there would be benefit, an enema or glycerine suppositories can be offered. Sometimes for cultural reasons women will shave their own genital/perineal areas.</p>
                        <h4>Bath or shower</h4>
                        <p>Immersion in a warm bath or birthing pool can be an effective form of pain relief for labouring women that facilitates increased mobility with no increased incidence of adverse outcome for the woman or fetus (Da Silva et al 2009). The midwife should invite the woman who is mobile to have a bath or shower whenever she wishes during labour.</p>
                        <h4>Clothing</h4>
                        <p>It is entirely up to the individual woman what she wears in labour. If in hospital she may prefer to wear the loose gown offered or she may feel more comfortable wearing her own choice of clothing. As long as she is aware that the garment may become wet and bloodstained and that she may require more than one, there is no reason to restrict her choice.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Position and mobility</h3>
                        <p>There are physical benefits if the woman maintains an upright position, including a shorter labour and a reduction in the need for analgesia (Lawrence et al 2009), fewer episiotomies and fewer abnormal fetal heart rate patterns (Gupta et al 2012). Other benefits include increasing the woman's sense of control (Coppen 2005), thus contributing to a positive birth experience. Lying on the bed during labour or birth does little to enhance the physiological birth process and has disadvantages, including a risk of aorto-caval compression and reduced interspinous diameter of the pelvic outlet, increased pain and slower descent of the presenting part.</p>
                        <p>The need to provide a continuous tracing of the fetal heart can inhibit maternal mobility and in some cases, such as with women who are significantly obese, have pre-existing mobility problems or have an epidural in situ, this cannot be avoided. Despite this, the majority of women, including some obese women, will be able to maintain an upright position, retain a degree of mobility and achieve birth away from a birthing bed if supported in doing so. A key factor in encouraging different labour positions and mobility is the environment (Royal College of Midwives [RCM] 2012a). The birthing room should contain equipment such as beanbags, birthing balls and chairs (Albers 2007) and the midwife should be proactive in encouraging the woman to remain active and to change her position. Although women should be encouraged to move and adopt whatever position they find most comfortable (NICE 2007), the midwife should be aware that the woman's choice of birth position may be influenced by what she thinks is expected of her rather than what is actually more comfortable.</p>
                        <p>Cultures where women are constrained and limited in their posture and positioning during labour are in fact the exception rather than the rule. Many cultures use movement, dance, physical contact and massage to encourage and sustain the process of labour. Henley-Einion (2007) discusses the value of the Five Rhythms method. Movements described as flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness, which are a combination of expressive movements rather than a set of routine exercises, are employed to provide dance and the music defines, guides, inspires and prompts the body. Such a strategy would be a fitting one to use during the birthing process.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Pressure ulcer prevention</h3>
                        <p>A pressure ulcer (decubitus ulcer) is a localized injury to the skin and underlying tissue that arises when an area of skin is placed under pressure. Where women have pre-existing mobility problems or an epidural in progress, they will be at increased risk of developing pressure ulcers during labour. In 2010 alone there were around 100 reports of women who had developed a pressure ulcer while in a maternity ward (NPSA 2010). All maternity areas should therefore have guidelines for the prevention of pressure ulcers and the midwife must take great care to ensure that the condition of the woman's skin is observed and described in the notes with details documented in the records at 2-hourly intervals.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Nutrition in labour</h3>
                        <p>It has been estimated that in established labour a woman requires a calorie intake of 121 kcal/hour and that 47 kcal/hr is required to prevent ketosis (Hall Moran and Dykes 2006). Most women will be able to draw on glucose stores to provide energy but if insufficient carbohydrate is available energy will be obtained from body fat and this will release ketones, resulting in ketoacidosis.</p>
                        <p>Dietary care in labour is a controversial issue due to the dearth of good-quality evidence and as a result there is no universal consensus on management. Hospital policies are usually based on the need to restrict food intake in order to prevent gastric aspiration. However, the number of women experiencing gastric aspiration is extremely low and there is no evidence to support the view that starvation will guarantee an empty stomach or prevent gastric acidity (NICE 2007). Starvation in labour can also have psychosocial effects as the provision of food and drink can provide comfort and reassurance, whilst the denial can be seen as authoritarian, stressful and intimidating, which can increase feelings of apprehension (RCM 2012b). For many women in normal labour a low residue, low fat diet and freely available fluids will be appropriate. As there is evidence that the desire to eat is more common in women in early labour (Singata et al 2010) and most women do not want to eat in active labour, it is important that the woman is not encouraged to eat if she has no desire to do so.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Bladder care</h3>
                        <p>Although frequent bladder emptying during labour is recommended, there is no evidence to support any particular regime of intervention. It is therefore reasonable to consider that the bladder should be emptied at least 4-hourly or more frequently if it is palpable abdominally. There is some evidence that infrequent bladder emptying in labour is associated with an increased risk of urinary incontinence in the postpartum period (Birch et al 2009). A full bladder may increase pain, reduce efficiency of uterine contractions and delay descent of the presenting part (Simkin and Ancheta 2011).</p>
                        <p>The woman's sensation to micturate during labour may be reduced by pressure of the presenting part during its descent through the pelvis, or by an effective epidural block. In all cases of delay in labour, the midwife should ascertain whether the bladder is full and encourage the woman to void regularly. Where possible the woman should be encouraged to use the toilet, and if this is not possible, the midwife should provide privacy and ensure maximum comfort by placing the bedpan on the chair, stool or bed and encouraging the woman to adopt a leaning forwards position. The sound or feel of water can also help to trigger the micturition reflex. If the bladder is incompletely emptied or the woman is unable to void for some hours, it may become necessary to introduce a catheter into the bladder. As the risk of infection is increased with the use of retaining catheters, it is generally recommended that an 'in-out' catheter is used.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Medicine records</h3>
                        <p>Midwives have an exemption from requiring a prescription for specific medicines used in the care of women in physiological labour. In the UK, NHS Trusts also have locally agreed patient group directions to which the midwife should adhere, providing guidance as to which medicines are preferred and what doses and frequency should be used within that Trust. If the midwife is practising outside the area in which she has notified her intention to practise, she should consult the supervisor of midwives regarding any matters relating to the supply, administration, storage or surrender of controlled drugs or medicines (NMC 2010, 2012).</p>
                        <p>As well as being entered on the partogram, doses of drugs are recorded on the prescription sheet, in the summary of labour and, in the case of controlled drugs, in the Controlled Drugs Register.</p>
