                        <p>When labour moves to the phase of active maternal pushing, the whole tempo of activity changes. The change in nature of uterine activity can lead women to express confusion and loss of control. Intense physical effort and exertion is needed as the baby is finally pushed towards its birth. The woman, her supporting companions and her midwife all require stamina and courage. Excitement and expectation mount as the birth becomes imminent. A positive outcome will depend upon mutual respect and trust between all involved professional groups, and between those groups and the labouring woman and her companions. A woman will never forget a midwife who positively supports her capacity to give birth to her baby, as shown in Diane's story (see Box 17.7).</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-1" class="section-heading">THE NATURE OF THE TRANSITION AND SECOND STAGE PHASES OF LABOUR</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The second stage of labour has traditionally been regarded as the phase between full dilatation of the cervical os, and the birth of the baby. However, the physiological reality of stages and phases of labour has been questioned (Walsh 2010; Zhang et al 2010). See Box 17.1 for examples of other controversial issues at this point in labour. Most midwives and labouring women are aware of a transitional period between the period of cervical dilatation, and the time when active maternal pushing efforts begin. This is typically characterized by maternal restlessness, discomfort, desire for pain relief, a sense that the process is never-ending, and demands to attendants to end the whole process. Appropriate midwifery care encompasses both knowledge of the usual physiological processes of this phase and of the mechanism of birth, and insight into the needs and choices of each individual labouring woman.</p>
                        <p>The physiological changes are a continuation of the same forces that occurred in the earlier hours of labour, but activity is accelerated. This acceleration, however, does not occur abruptly. Some women may experience an urge to push before the cervical os is fully dilated, and others may experience a lull before the onset of strong expulsive second stage contractions. This latter phenomenon has been termed the resting phase of the second stage of labour. The formal onset of the second stage of labour is traditionally confirmed with a vaginal examination to check for full dilatation of the cervical os. However, a finding of full cervical dilatation may occur some time after this stage has in fact been reached, and maternal behavioral changes may be a good indication that expulsive contractions are occurring (Baker and Kenner 1993; Dahlen et al 2013; Downe et al 2013).</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 17.1 Examples of areas of controversy in labour transition and second stage</h4>
                            <p>Discussion about the nature of normal physiological labour and birth has taken place for at least the last 50 years, with an increase in publications in this area over the last decade or so (Montgomery 1958; Crawford 1983; Downe 1994, 2004, 2006, 2008; Gould 2000; Anderson 2003 Downe et al 2013; Hannah et al 2013). These debates include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The utility of dividing labour into standard 'phases' or 'stages'.</li>
                                <li>The need or otherwise for regular vaginal examinations to assess the progress of labour.</li>
                                <li>The nature of transition.</li>
                                <li>The nature and impact of the early pushing urge.</li>
                                <li>Pushing in the context of epidural analgesia.</li>
                                <li>The efficacy of signs of progress such as the anal cleft line and the appearance of the rhomboid of Michaelis.</li>
                                <li>The significance, and optimum management, of the tight nuchal cord at the time of birth.</li>
                                <li>The physiological limits to the length of the second stage of labour.</li>
                                <li>Long-term outcome for the neonate relating to childbirth interventions.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h3>Uterine action</h3>
                        <p>Contractions become stronger and longer but may be less frequent, allowing both mother and fetus regular recovery periods. The membranes often rupture spontaneously towards the end of the first stage or during transition to the second stage. The consequent drainage of liquor allows the presenting part, either the hard, round fetal head or the buttocks, to be directly applied to the vaginal tissues. This pressure aids distension. Fetal axis pressure increases flexion of the presenting part, resulting in smaller presenting diameters, more rapid progress and less trauma to both mother and fetus. If the mother is upright during this time, these processes are optimized.</p>
                        <p>The contractions become expulsive as the fetus descends further into the vagina. Pressure from the presenting part stimulates nerve receptors in the pelvic floor. This phenomenon is termed the 'Ferguson reflex'. As a consequence, the woman experiences the need to push. This reflex may initially be controlled to a limited extent but becomes increasingly compulsive, overwhelming and involuntary.</p>
                        <p>The mother's response is to employ her secondary powers of expulsion by contracting her abdominal muscles and diaphragm.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Soft tissue displacement</h3>
                        <p>As the fetal head descends, the soft tissues of the pelvis become displaced. Anteriorly, the bladder is pushed upwards into the abdomen where it is at less risk of injury during fetal descent. This results in the stretching and thinning of the urethra so that its lumen is reduced. Posteriorly, the rectum becomes flattened into the sacral curve and the pressure of the advancing head expels any residual faecal matter. The levator ani muscles dilate, thin out and are displaced laterally, and the perineal body is flattened, stretched and thinned. The fetal head becomes visible at the vulva, advancing with each contraction and receding between contractions until crowning takes place. The head is then born. The shoulders and body follow with the next contraction, accompanied by a gush of amniotic fluid and sometimes of blood. The second stage culminates in the birth of the baby.</p>
