                    <h2 id="section-heading-1" class="section-heading">ASSISTING A VAGINAL BIRTH</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Assisted vaginal birth is a frequently and widely practised intervention in the provision of care to women during childbirth. In England during 2011-12, of the 668936 births recorded, 85009 (13%) were assisted with forceps or ventouse (Health and Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episodes Statistics 2012). However, the incidence of instrumental intervention varies widely both between and within countries, and may be performed as infrequently as 1.5% or as often as 26%. Such differences may be linked to the alternative management strategies employed during labour in different units (Bragg et al 2010). Various techniques have been championed to help lower the rates of operative births. These are summarized in Box 21.1.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted, however, that other interventions, such as epidural analgesia, have been observed to be associated with an increased risk of instrumental vaginal birth and have been suggested to be linked to an increased risk of birth by caesarean section (CS) (Anim-Somuah et al 2011). However, such 'disadvantages' must be balanced against the higher rates of maternal satisfaction that this form of analgesia provides. It is up to the woman to make an informed choice as to which of the benefits and risks are most important, not up to the attending medical staff to make didactic decisions on her behalf. Indeed, whilst it has been commented (Johanson and Menon 1999) that, in general, maternal outcomes would be improved by lowering instrumental birth rates, no evidence to support such a statement has ever been forthcoming, as it is not easy to see what the alternatives are for a woman who, despite her own best efforts, has not been able to secure a 'normal birth'.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The indications for assisted vaginal birth may be simply categorized into fetal and maternal. However, the reasons cited for intervention are frequently imprecise as multiple factors often interact.</p>
                        <h3>Fetal</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Malposition of the fetal head (occipitolateral and occipitoposterior). Such positions occur more frequently in the presence of regional anaesthesia, as alterations in the tone of the pelvic floor may impede the spontaneous rotation to the optimal occipitoanterior position during the decent of the presenting part (vertex of the fetal head).</li>
                            <li>Fetal 'distress' is a commonly cited indication for instrumental intervention; however, 'presumed fetal compromise' is a more comprehensive term (unless a fetal blood sample has been obtained showing hypoxia and acidosis, in which case 'fetal hypoxia' should be used) (NICE [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence] 2007).</li>
                            <li>Elective instrumental intervention for infants of reduced weight. In infants weighing <1.5 kg, delivery with forceps does not confer an advantage over spontaneous birth and may increase the incidence of intracranial haemorrhage. Ventouse carries the same risks, but in addition should be avoided in infants of <34<sup>+6</sup> weeks of gestation.</li>
                            <li>Assisted vaginal breech birth. Forceps can be applied to the after-coming head to control the birth of the vertex, a situation where the ventouse is contraindicated.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Maternal</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The commonest maternal indications are those of maternal distress, exhaustion, or prolongation of the second stage of labour. This has been suggested as greater than 2 hours in a primigravida (3 hours if an epidural is in situ), or more than 1 hour in a multipara (2 hours if an epidural is in situ) (NICE 2007).</li>
                            <li>Medically significant conditions such as: aortic valve disease with significant outflow obstruction; myasthenia gravis; significant antepartum haemorrhage due to placental abruption or vasa praevia; severe hypertensive disease; and previous CS (to minimize the risk of scar rupture).</li>

                        <h3>Absolute</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The vertex is ≥ 1/5<sup>th</sup> palpable abdominally.</li>
                            <li>The position as determined by a vaginal examination (occipitoanterior/posterior or lateral) of the fetal head is unknown.</li>
                            <li>Before full dilatation of the cervix (although a possible exception occurs with the ventouse birth of a second twin).</li>

                            <li>If there is a significant degree of caput that may either preclude correct placement of the cup or, more sinisterly, indicate a substantial degree of cephalopelvic disproportion CPD).</li>

                            <li>Fetal bleeding disorders (e.g. alloimmune thrombocytopenia) or a predisposition to fractures (e.g. osteogenesis imperfecta) are relative contraindications specifically to an operative birth with the ventouse. However, the comparative risks of a birth by a difficult second stage caesarean section must also be considered and a discussion undertaken antenatally about the most appropriate plan for birth (it may be wiser to recommend that such women have an elective CS).</li>
                            <li>There is minimal risk of fetal haemorrhage if the vacuum extractor is employed following fetal blood sampling or application of a scalp electrode.</li>

                        <h3>Types of ventouse</h3>
                        <p>Until recently, the most commonly used ventouse in use in the United Kingdom (UK) was that of the 'soft' or silicone cup design (Fig. 21.1A). Whilst these cups have the undoubted advantages of being extremely malleable (reducing maternal trauma by being more easy to correctly place within the vagina) and having a reduced incidence of fetal scalp trauma when compared to other cup designs, soft cups have a poorer success rate than metal cups in achieving a vaginal birth (RCOG [Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists] 2011).</p>
                        <p>Metal cup ventouse designs are of the Bird or Malstrom types, which have a centrally placed traction chain with a laterally located vacuum conduit. They come in diameters of 4, 5 and 6 cm.</p>
                        <p>Both the standard soft and metal cup designs require the generation of an operating vacuum from an external source - and as such these pieces of equipment require two operators for their successful use (one to control the placement of the ventouse and assist the birth, the other (most commonly the attending midwife) to control the degree of vacuum that is generated.</p>
                        <p>More recent advances in design have removed the need for the external suction generators by incorporating the vacuum mechanism into 'hand-held' pumps (e.g. Kiwi OmniCup<sup>TM</sup>) as illustrated in Fig. 21.1(B). Such devices are safe and may be useful for rotational births because they are low profile and are easily manoeuvered into the correct position. However, they have a significantly higher failure rate than the conventional metal cup ventouse, with cup detachments occurring more frequently.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The use of the ventouse</h3>
                        <p>The ventouse is more frequently employed by obstetricians than the obstetric forceps due to its apparent ease of use and comparative safety. However, repeated meta-analyses have demonstrated that the ventouse is less likely to achieve a successful vaginal birth than forceps, although both types of instruments are associated with a lowering of the overall CS rate (Johanson and Menon 1999). Although the ventouse is associated with an increased risk of neonatal complications such as cephalohaematoma (Chapter 31), other facial (nerve palsies) and significant cranial injuries (fractures) are more common with forceps.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Procedure</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The rationale for the birth is discussed with the woman and her partner. The procedure is explained and consent obtained (written consent should be obtained if time allows).</li>
                            <li>The woman's legs should be placed into the lithotomy position.</li>
                            <li>Whilst inhalational analgesia may be sufficient (entonox - N<sub>2</sub>O), more commonly a pudendal nerve block with perineal infiltration may be administered, or an epidural, if already in situ, may be topped up.</li>
                            <li>Once adequate analgesia is assured, the maternal bladder is emptied.</li>
                            <li>The fetal heart rate (FHR) must be continuously monitored (with a cardiotocograph - CTG).</li>
                            <li>For the successful use of the ventouse, it is essential to determine the flexion point, which is located, in an average term infant, along the sagittal suture 3 cm anterior to the posterior fontanelle (and thus 6 cm posterior to the anterior fontanelle). The centre of the cup should be placed directly over this, as failure to adequately position the cup can lead to a progressive deflexion of the fetal head during traction.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The operating vacuum pressure for nearly all ventouse is between 0.6 and 0.8 kg/cm<sup>2</sup> (60-80 kPa/500-800 cmH<sub>2</sub>O). No evidence exists that a stepwise reduction in pressure improves the rate of successful birth when compared with a linear reduction. Using the latter technique with a silastic cup, a caput succedaneum (Chapter 31) is formed instantly, and with the metal cup or OmniCup<sup>TM</sup>, an adequate chignon is produced in <2 minutes. It is important to note that a cup of 5 cm diameter is suitable for nearly all births, even with larger babies.</p>
                        <p>When the vacuum is achieved, traction must be applied to coincide with a contraction and thus maternal expulsive efforts. Without both of these contributing factors, birth with a ventouse will fail. Traction is provided along a track defined by the curve of Carus (Chapter 3): initially in a downwards and backwards direction, then in a forward and upward manner. Once the fetal head has crowned, the vacuum is released, the cup removed and with further maternal efforts the baby will be born. In addition to the relative ease of use and low risk of complications, it is undoubtedly this sense of contribution to the birth that makes the ventouse a more satisfactory birthing experience for the mother and her partner than an operative birth with obstetric forceps.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Precautions in use</h3>
                        <p>With the ventouse, the operator should allow ≤ 2 episodes of breaking the suction in any vacuum assisted birth, and the maximum time from application to birth should ideally be ≤ 15 minutes. If there is no evidence of descent with the first pull, the woman should be reassessed to ascertain the reason for failure to progress. In addition, care should be taken to ensure that no vaginal skin is trapped in the edges of the cup as this can result in complex degrees of perineal trauma that can be extremely difficult to repair in a satisfactory fashion.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The midwife ventouse practitioner</h3>
                        <p>Some midwives feel that women will be better served by a midwife ventouse practitioner rather than an obstetrician and embrace such innovations (Tinsley 2010). However, others see it as exceeding the limits of normal midwifery practice (Charles 1999). The fact is that midwifery care is changing and developing, specifically with the advancement of care within stand-alone midwife-led units.</p>
                        <p>Whilst the idea of reducing the psychological trauma to a woman during a birth by limiting the number of carers in attendance at this crucial and critical time is to be commended, it would be foolhardy to assume that the midwife ventouse practitioner would be the primary carer for every pregnant women on every occasion that required an assisted vaginal birth. As such it is likely that a midwife previously unknown to the labouring woman would be asked to assist at the moment when help is required, an event that would therefore be no less 'traumatic' for a woman or her partner than asking an obstetrician to attend. All accoucheurs, including midwife ventouse practitioners, must be well educated and trained before carrying out a ventouse birth - although it is highly unlikely that the more complex surgical skills required of a birth by forceps or CS would be mastered in addition. It should be remembered that as a ventouse will fail in up to 20% of cases, even in the most skilled hands, having no ability to change instruments or resort to birth by CS will place those midwives who work as ventouse practitioners in isolation in a most unenviable position.</p>
