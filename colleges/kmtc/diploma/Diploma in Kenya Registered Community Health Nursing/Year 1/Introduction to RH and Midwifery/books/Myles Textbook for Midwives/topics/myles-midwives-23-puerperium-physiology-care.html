                        <p>There is current evidence that postnatal care is often undervalued and under-resourced even though it is an important and challenging time for a mother who has recently given birth, her partner and family (Wray and Bick 2012). Current postnatal care in the United Kingdom (UK) can involve several healthcare practitioners. Midwives are the lead health professional, with support from maternity support workers, general practitioners, health visitors and other practitioners depending on the mother's individual needs and circumstances. Both public and voluntary services can work together to support the mother, father, baby and other family members to cope and adjust following the birth of a new baby (Department of Health [DH] 2005; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE] 2006; Nursing and Midwifery Council [NMC] 2012). This approach to postnatal care differs from that offered to women in most other developed countries where the provision for regular contact with midwives as the main healthcare professional responsible for postnatal care is less well defined. (Potential postnatal morbidity and in some cases mortality for the mother is discussed in Chapter 24.)</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Following the birth of a baby, placenta and membranes, the newly birthed mother enters a period of physical and emotional/psychological recuperation (Buckley 2006; Wray 2012). Skin-to-skin contact is advocated immediately following birth and during the postnatal period as there is clear evidence of benefit to the mother and father (Moore et al 2012). The puerperium starts immediately after birth of the placenta and membranes and continues for 6 weeks. In many cultures around the world 40 days for recuperation is a time-honoured practice (Hundt et al 2000; Waugh 2011). A general expectation is that by 6 weeks after birth a woman's body will have recovered sufficiently from the effects of pregnancy and the process of parturition. However, there has now been a recognition that the return to a non-pregnant state of health and wellbeing can take much longer (World Health Organization [WHO], 2010; Bick et al 2011). Some women continue to experience health problems related to childbirth that extend well beyond the 6-week period defined as the puerperium (WHO 2010). In some cases, healing and recovery can take up to a year following birth (Bedwell 2006; Wray and Bick 2012).</p>
                        <p>It has been customary to refer to the first weeks after the birth as the postnatal period, defined in the UK by the NMC as 'a period after the end of labour during which the attendance of a midwife upon a woman and baby is required, being not less than 10 days and for such longer period as the midwife considers necessary' (NMC 2012: 6).</p>
                        <p>By no longer stating an endpoint in time until which midwifery care can still be made available to women, it is envisaged that offering more flexibility to the provision of midwifery care will make a positive impact on the health and wellbeing of women (Cattrell et al 2005; Redshaw and Heikkila 2010).</p>
                        <p>The National Childbirth Trust (NCT) makes clear on its website that it is the quality of postnatal care provided to women and families in the first days and weeks after birth that can have a huge impact and affect mothers' and families' experiences of the transition to parenthood (NCT 2012).</p>
                        <p>However, in this present climate, when there is an ever-increasing birth rate, a shortage of midwives and ongoing financial constraints, this is an extremely challenging task for maternity service providers.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-2" class="section-heading">HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Postnatal care in the UK has been an integral part of the midwife's role since the beginning of the last century following the introduction of the Midwives Act in 1902. This was instigated by the high maternal mortality rates. Despite a decline in death rates among all age groups in the general population, maternal mortality rates remained high. The majority of maternal deaths were caused by puerperal infection (interestingly, the latest triennial report on the Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths in the UK cites sepsis as currently the leading cause of maternal mortality [CMACE 2011]).</p>
                        <p>This had a marked effect on what constituted important aspects of postnatal care. Routine observations, such as temperature, pulse, respirations, blood pressure, breast examination, uterine involution and observation of lochia, were introduced as well as a set pattern of postnatal visits.</p>
                        <p>Midwives were expected to visit twice a day for the first three days and then daily until day 10, commonly referred to as the 'lying in period' (Leap and Hunter 1993). Two further Midwives Acts extended the regulatory maximum duration of postnatal care from 10 to 14 days in 1936 and then this was increased to 28 days in 1962. This approach to postnatal care was considered appropriate to meet the needs of women at that time. However, a considerable decline in maternal mortality rates began in the 1930s and has continued up to the present day. A traditional pattern and content of postnatal care continued until the 1980s. Then, two major changes happened that affected the pattern of postnatal care, those being the woman returning home much earlier following childbirth and the introduction of 'selective visiting' rather than specified days in 1986 by the former midwifery governing body, the United Kingdom Central Council (UKCC 1986). A postal survey undertaken in England in 1991 reported that most maternity services had changed from the daily home visits up to the tenth postnatal day to selective home visits, but there was wide variation in patterns of selective visiting (Garcia et al 1994). This may be due to the fact that little guidance was given on how to plan and implement this change and there was no evaluation with regard to the implications for women. A House of Commons Health Committee report (Winterton 1992) highlighted, among other things, that postnatal care was neglected and there was a lack of research in this area. This was followed by the establishment of the Expert Maternity Committee, whose remit was to examine policy and make recommendations for the maternity services in England and Wales. Their report 'Changing Childbirth' (DH 1993) recommended that the maternity services should offer women more choice, greater continuity of care, more involvement in the planning of their care and should be midwifery-led, and more recently the 'Maternity Matters' report (DH 2007a) reiterated these recommendations.</p>
                        <p>Today, a partnership approach, where the woman is encouraged to explore how she is feeling physically and emotionally and to seek the advice and support of the midwife, is advocated (Wray and Bick 2012). The importance of all newly birthed mothers having access to postnatal care that will meet their individual needs is underpinned by the NMC (2012) Midwives Rules and Standards and by a national guideline defining core care, and what should be provided for the mother and baby in the days and weeks following birth (NICE 2006).</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-3" class="section-heading">FRAMEWORK AND REGULATION FOR POSTNATAL CARE</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The initial framework for hospital postnatal care in the early 20th century involved a regimented approach, with the newly birthed mother being viewed as a patient; a period of prescribed bed rest, compliance with hospital regimens such as vulval swabbing, binding of legs and separation from her baby were thus routine procedures. A gradual shift in this 'sickness' framework of care as described by Parsons (1951) started to occur during the 20th century. Renfrew (2010) describes how mothers in the late 1970s and early 1980s were still kept in postnatal wards for a week or more after birth and their babies were kept in nurseries with their feeds timed and measured, regardless of whether they were being breastfed or formula-fed. In the 1990s the provision of postpartum care was reviewed with regard to its content, purpose or effectiveness (Marsh and Sargent 1991; Garcia and Marchant 1993; Twaddle et al 1993); this led to research that investigated and challenged regimented and ritual patterns of postpartum care (Bick et al 2002; Shaw et al 2006; Wray 2006).</p>
                        <p>Nowadays, mothers have the choice to return home in a few hours after the birth, as it is considered both safe and acceptable by society at large. The newly birthed mother can recuperate in her own familiar surroundings with the support of her family and friends.</p>
                        <p>The recent Health and Social Care Act 2012 will continue to support mothers to make their own choices about who and what services/care best meet their individual needs. Independent sector providers as well as National Health Service (NHS) maternity service providers will be free to innovate to deliver quality services.</p>

                        <p>It is vitally important that midwives have the knowledge and skills to determine when to be proactive and undertake specific observations when there are indications to do so. Therefore, the midwife needs to be able to acknowledge and recognize what are normal expected outcomes following birth and also be able to identify signs of what is not normal and when to instigate care that will involve further investigation, tests and the support of other health professionals. It is the midwife's responsibility to ensure she is competent and to undertake any further necessary education and training if required to provide extended care (see Box 23.1).</p>

                        <h3>Public health care</h3>
                        <p>It has long been recognized that poverty and being socially disadvantaged is society leads to increased risk of poor health and wellbeing (Hart 1971; Acheson 1998). In England, the Department of Health has acknowledged that 'Healthy mothers are key for giving healthy babies a healthy start in life' (DH 2004). It is important that mothers and their family receive information and advice about healthy lifestyles. Midwives have a vital role to address public health targets and are ideally situated to promote healthy lifestyles to the mother, her partner and extended family during the postnatal period. However, midwives cannot address public health issues alone and working collaboratively with other professionals and local communities and signposting to other services needs to occur. Models of care to give more intense care and support to disadvantaged groups have been developed. Sure Start centres were set up to provide accessible community-based services that would enable families with young children to improve their health and wellbeing (DH 1999). Targets were linked to public health issues such as smoking cessation, breastfeeding rates and reaching disadvantaged groups (National Evaluation of Sure Start [NESS] 2004). The government's Every Child Matters: Change for Children agenda (DfES 2004) supported the Sure Start goals and aimed to increase the support for children and young people up to the age of 19. These centres became Sure Start Children's Centres, where family healthcare and parenting skills from midwives and health visitors were delivered with support from other professionals (DCSF 2009).</p>
                        <p>Positive benefits for mothers and their families who live within the designated postcode for Children's Centre services have been reported (Tanner et al 2012). However, a sustained commitment to service provision and funding is essential for this to benefit mothers and their families. In 2009, Children's Centres became a statutory requirement under the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act (HM Government 2009; DfE 2010). In 2010, the Coalition government offered protection from spending cuts to enable Children's Centres to continue to provide a range of services to local communities but at the time of writing there are concerns in the present economic climate with budget reductions; the government is interested in developing community management models such as cooperatives and social enterprises (DfE 2012).</p>
                        <p>Working in tandem with Children's Centres is the Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) Programme as developed in the USA and recently piloted in selected areas of high deprivation in England. It has been reported that teenage first-time mothers, their partners and family find this approach acceptable (Barnes et al 2011). Further work is being undertaken to see if a group approach is of any benefit to families who are not eligible for the FNP programme (Barnes and Henderson 2012). Early indications show that there are some benefits and peer support is valuable. An holistic maternal health and wellbeing programme, specifically designed to raise awareness of the general health and wellbeing of mothers, their babies and families also reported how beneficial group and peer support is to postnatal mothers (Steen 2007b) (see Box 23.2).</p>
                        <p>Recently, the Health and Social Care Act 2012 gives a new focus to public health (HM Government 2012). This Act provides the underpinnings for Public Health England, a new body to drive improvements in public health.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The provision of and need for postnatal care</h3>
                        <p>The provision of midwifery care and support to newly birthed mothers needs to be woman-focused and family-orientated. Good communication to explain what is considered to be normal physical, emotional/psychological, occurrences during the postnatal period will reassure a mother that she is going through a normal physiological process. Building a trusting, caring relationship will give a mother confidence to ask questions when she has concerns and is anxious about her health and wellbeing.</p>
                        <p>A recent survey undertaken on behalf of the National Childbirth Trust (NCT 2010) involving 1260 first-time mothers reported that these mothers felt that midwives were always or mostly kind and understanding (80%) and treated them with respect (83%). However, there were still gaps in the provision and satisfaction with regards to postnatal care reported. Only 4% of mothers reported being involved in the development of a postnatal care plan to meet their individual needs as recommended by NICE (2006). Mothers who had undergone either an operative or surgical procedure to aid their birth were reported to be the least satisfied with their postnatal care. Although this survey does not represent the whole of the UK maternal population and socially disadvantaged mothers' voices were not represented, it does give an insight into areas where improvements in postnatal care provision should be targeted.</p>

                        <p>A social model of care that encompasses aspects of observing and monitoring the health and wellbeing of the mother, father and their baby initially, in a hospital and then home setting, will support both parents to adjust to their new parenting role. Guidance and reassurance is an important aspect of midwifery care. Working in partnership with the mother and father will assist them to develop confidence in their ability to be parents and care for their baby. There is growing evidence that when fathers are included this is beneficial to both the mother's and the baby's health and wellbeing (Flouri and Buchanan 2003; Bottorff et al 2006; Tohotoa et al 2009). For example, fathers can play an important role in breastfeeding support (Wolfberg et al 2004; Piscane et al 2005). Therefore, it is vital that they are included in discussions and pathways of care. Yet, there is also evidence that many fathers feel excluded unsure and fearful (Steen et al 2012). A recent publication entitled 'Reaching out: involving fathers in maternity care' (Royal College of Midwives [RCM] 2011: 3) has highlighted that 'to provide effective support fathers themselves need to be supported, involved and prepared'.</p>
                        <p>In the UK, it is still usual for a midwife to 'attend' a postpartum woman on a regular basis for the first few days regardless of whether the mother is in hospital or at home (NMC 2012). During the course of contact visits, midwifery practice has been to undertake a routine physical examination to assess the new mother's recovery from the birth (Rowan and Bick 2006; Bick 2012; Wray and Bick 2012). From an international perspective this practice is unusual; it is only comparatively recently that postpartum home visits, and postpartum support programmes, have been initiated in America, Canada and Australia (Boulvain et al 2004; Peterson et al 2005; Vernon 2007) and that women in these countries have recognized a need for and their satisfaction with current services (De Clerc 2006). In the UK, the role of maternity support worker (MSW) has been introduced to support midwives to provide care to mothers and their families. However, the development of MSWs can be inconsistent (Kings Fund 2011). The RCM (2010) Position Statement on maternity support workers reports that there should be a clear framework which defines their role, responsibility and arrangements for supervision. A study reviewed the involvement of maternity support workers in the community over an extended postnatal period and found no differences in health outcomes but reported that mothers found benefit in the extra support (Morrell et al 2000).</p>
                        <p>A common reference to postnatal services being the 'Cinderella' of the maternity service provision as a whole has led to repeated reports from women of poor support, disappointment in the services and in some cases evidence of negligence as a result of sub-standard care (Wray 2006; Lewis 2007; Redshaw and Heikkila 2010; WHO 2010).</p>
                        <p>The framework for assessing resources released from the NHS costs would appear to be based on a measurement of clinical need resulting in the main providers of health services having to make comparisons between postpartum women's needs and other members of the population who are suffering from acute or chronic illnesses (O'Sullivan and Tyler 2007). The birth of a baby does not attract the same level of funding as the needs of those with long-term conditions or terminal diseases. However, there has been an increasing awareness that there are important aspects around promoting good health and wellbeing of the newly birthed mother and baby as this has implications for the nation's healthcare costs (NICE 2006; NCT 2010). The postnatal care pathway recommended by NICE (2006a) is divided into three 'time bands' which cover the postnatal period, these are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the first 24 hours after birth</li>
                            <li>the first 2-7 days</li>
                            <li>the period from day 8 to around 6-8 weeks.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>During these postnatal time bands a midwife will need to advise women about some health problems that she may be at risk of developing and to discuss any symptoms or concerns she may have. Contact numbers and how to summon help and advice need to be made readily available and issuing regular reminders to encourage and enable a mother to do this if she has any concerns is paramount.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Midwifery postpartum contact and visits</h3>
                        <p>The majority of postnatal care in the UK now occurs either in the family or a relative's home. Expectations of mothers about the purpose of home visits by the midwife may vary according to their cultural backgrounds and individual needs. Some faiths hold important ceremonies for the newborn baby and a home visit from a midwife will need to be mutually arranged to fit around these. Newly birthed mothers who have experienced motherhood before may feel that they need minimal support from a midwife and this can also be mutually arranged. In contrast, a first-time mother or a mother who has had complications will more likely need further support and contact. The concept of postpartum care is one that aims to assist the mother, her baby and family towards attaining an optimum health status. Where the visit from the midwife can be seen as supportive and useful to the mother and her family, this purpose is more likely to be achieved. Research that has explored the experiences of women from different ethnic backgrounds has demonstrated marked inequalities in both the provision of services as well as the actual direct contact with caregivers (Hirst and Hewison 2002). In contrast, where the timing of midwifery postpartum care is extended beyond 28 days, there is greater opportunity for midwives to continue midwifery support where this might be appropriate, and this has been welcomed as progress although the focus would appear to be more on social or psychological outcomes, or for breastfeeding support than overt clinical or physical morbidity (Winter et al 2001; Bick et al 2002). In the United States a woman can choose to employ a doula to help her during her transition to motherhood. A doula can provide physical, emotional and social support (Simkin 2008). This option is becoming more readily available in the UK (Gibbon and Steen 2012).</p>
