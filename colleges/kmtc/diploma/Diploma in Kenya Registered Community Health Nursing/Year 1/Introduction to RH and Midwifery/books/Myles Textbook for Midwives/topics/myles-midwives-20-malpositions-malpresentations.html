                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Malposition refers to any position other than occipitoanterior (OA) in a fetus with a vertex presentation. In a normal physiological labour, the fetal head presents with the occiput in lateral position in early stages of labour with anterior rotation as labour progresses.</p>
                        <p>Malpresentations are all presentations of the fetus other than the vertex. Malpresentations that occur due to extension of the fetal head, causing brow or face to present, are usually diagnosed during active labour. Prompt and appropriate referral must be made.</p>
                        <p>Both malpositions and malpresentations are associated with a difficult labour and an increased risk of operative intervention. The midwife must undertake regular clinical examinations to monitor the progress of labour to ensure fetal and maternal wellbeing. Effective communication and record keeping is crucial to provide safe care. The woman and her partner must be kept fully informed and supported throughout. Vaginal birth is possible in many cases, but intervention or operative birth become necessary when the malposition or malpresentation persist and labour fails to progress.</p>

                        <p>Malpositions and malpresentations present the midwife with challenges of recognition and diagnosis both in the antenatal period and during labour. The midwife must ensure all examinations and discussions with the woman are documented and appropriate obstetric referral is made where a malpresentation or malposition has been found. The midwife should take time to discuss this with the women to ensure they understand what may happen and the activities that may help (Munro and Jokinen 2012).</p>
                        <p>The presenting diameters do not fit well onto the cervix and therefore do not produce optimal stimulation for uterine contractions and labour. Labour with a fetus in a malposition or a malpresentation can be long, tedious and painful, requiring empathy, sustained encouragement and support for the woman and her partner. All the usual care in labour is provided, paying particular attention to comfort and hydration (see Chapter 16). The woman should be encouraged to take an active part in decision-making and must be kept informed throughout.</p>
                        <p>In labour women should be encouraged to adopt postures and positions they find comfortable and encouraged to remain mobile. They should be supported to use coping methods to deal with their particular pattern of labour (Simkin 2010). The progress of labour may be slow so midwives should take care to avoid the use of language that may demoralize the woman and her partner. Any sign of fetal or maternal distress or delay in labour must be referred promptly to an obstetrician. Practices that are considered unhelpful include immobility and labouring on a bed, the setting of arbitrary time limits on the various stages of labour and the early use of epidural analgesia (Munro and Jokinen 2012).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Occipitoposterior (OP) positions are the most common type of malposition of the occiput and occur in approximately 10-30% of labours, but only around 5% of births (Pearl et al 1993; Ponkey et al 2003; Munro and Jokinen 2012). Women can be reassured that internal rotation to anterior positions can be expected in the majority of cases. A persistent OP position results from a failure of internal rotation or malrotation prior to birth (Gardberg et al 1998; Peregrine et al 2007). The vertex is presenting, but the occiput lies in the posterior rather than the anterior part of the pelvis. As a consequence, the fetal head is deflexed and larger diameters of the fetal skull present (Fig. 20.1).</p>

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h3>Causes</h3>
                        <p>The direct cause of the occipitoposterior position is often unknown, but it may be associated with an abnormally shaped pelvis. In an android pelvis, the forepelvis is narrow and the occiput tends to occupy the roomier hindpelvis. The oval shape of the anthropoid pelvis, with its narrow transverse diameter, favours a direct OP position.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Antenatal diagnosis</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Abdominal examination</h4>
                        <p>Listen to the woman, as she may complain of backache and report feeling that her baby's bottom is very high up against her ribs, as well as feeling movements across both sides of her abdomen.</p>
                        
                        <h5>On inspection</h5>
                        <p>There is a saucer-shaped depression at or just below the umbilicus. This depression is created by the 'dip' between the head and the lower limbs of the fetus. The outline created by the high, unengaged head can look like a full bladder (Fig. 20.2).</p>
                        
                        <h5>On palpation</h5>
                        <p>While the breech is easily palpated at the fundus, the back is difficult to palpate as it is well out to the maternal side, sometimes almost adjacent to the maternal spine. Limbs can be felt on both sides of the midline. The head is unusually high in an OP position which is the most common cause of non-engagement in a primigravida at term. This is because the large presenting diameter, the occipitofrontal (11.5 cm), is unlikely to enter the pelvic brim until labour begins and flexion occurs. The occiput and sinciput are on the same level (Figs 20.3 and 20.4). Flexion allows the engagement of the suboccipitofrontal diameter (10 cm).</p>
                        <p>The cause of the deflexion is a straightening of the fetal spine against the lumbar curve of the maternal spine. This makes the fetus straighten its neck and adopt a more erect attitude.</p>
                        
                        <h5>On auscultation</h5>
                        <p>The fetal back is not well flexed so the chest is thrust forward, therefore the fetal heart can be heard in the midline. However, the fetal heart may be heard more easily at the flank on the same side as the back.</p>

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h3>Antenatal preparation</h3>
                        <p>There is no current evidence that suggests active changes of maternal posture will help to achieve an optimal fetal position before labour (Hunter et al 2007; Munro and Jokinen 2012). Research has shown that the woman adopting a knee-chest position several times a day may achieve temporary rotation of the fetus to an anterior position but has only a short-term effect upon fetal presentation (Kariminia et al 2004; Hunter et al 2007). There is insufficient evidence to suggest that women should adopt the hands and knees posture, unless they find it comfortable (Simkin 2010; Munro and Jokinen 2012). Further research is needed to evaluate the effect of adopting a hands and knees posture on the presenting part during labour (Hunter et al 2007).</p>
                        <p>For customary antenatal assessment of fetal position Leopold's manoeuvres can be used during abdominal examination (see Chapter 10). These traditional methods of examination are only an assessment of the placement of the fetal spine and cannot estimate the direction of the fetal head. Peregrine et al (2007) used ultrasound scans to confirm abdominal palpation and found that the fetal head is often aligned differently within the pelvis than the fetal spine within the uterus. In other words, the fetus may have turned its head to the right or left and the head may be anterior within the pelvis but the fetal back may palpate as lateral.</p>
                        <p>A review of current techniques used to diagnose fetal position such as Leopold's manoeuvres, the location of fetal heart sounds, vaginal examinations and presence of back pain are often unreliable (Simkin 2010). Failure to identify fetal position accurately can impact on the ability of the midwife to offer appropriate care. Consequently it is considered that ultrasound is the most reliable way to accurately detect the fetal position (Munro and Jokinen 2012). More research studies are needed to examine the efficacy of midwifery skills in diagnosing fetal malpositions and non-technological approaches to improving the birth outcome for the woman and fetus.</p>

                        <h3>Intrapartum diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>The large and irregularly shaped presenting circumference (Fig. 20.5) does not fit well onto the cervix. This may hinder cervical ripening and predispose to a prolonged latent phase (Akmal and Paterson-Brown 2009). The contractions may also be in-coordinate. A high head predisposes to early spontaneous rupture of the membranes at an early stage of labour, which, together with an ill-fitting presenting part, may result in cord prolapse (see Chapter 22).</p>
                        <p>The woman may complain of continuous and severe backache, worsening with contractions. However, the absence of backache does not necessarily indicate an anteriorly positioned fetus. Descent of the head can be slow even with good contractions. The woman may have a strong desire to push early in labour because the occiput is pressing on the rectum.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Vaginal examination</h4>
                        <p>The findings (Fig. 20.6) will depend upon the degree of flexion of the head. Locating the anterior fontanelle in the anterior part of the pelvis is diagnostic but this may be difficult if caput succedaneum is present. The direction of the sagittal suture and location of the posterior fontanelle will help to confirm the diagnosis. The position of the fetal head may be checked using ultrasound where reason for the delay in labour requires accurate diagnosis.</p>

                        <h3>Midwifery care</h3>
                        
                        <h4>First stage of labour</h4>
                        <p>The woman may experience severe and unremitting backache, which is tiring and can be very demoralizing, especially if the progress of labour is slow. Continuous support from the midwife will help the woman and her partner to cope with the labour (Simkin 2010; Hodnett et al 2012) (see Chapter 16). The midwife can help to provide physical support such as massage and other comfort measures. Mobility should be encouraged with changes of posture and position and where possible, the use of a bath or birthing pool and other non-pharmacological measures such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) or aromatherapy. There is no evidence that the all-fours position either during pregnancy or in labour will rotate a malpositioned baby (Kariminia et al 2004; Munro and Jokinen 2012) but may help reduce persistent back pain. An exaggerated Sims position in labour may offer some relief, and anecdotal evidence suggests that it may also aid rotation of the fetal head.</p>
                        <p>The woman may experience a strong urge to push long before the cervix has become fully dilated. This is because of the pressure of the occiput on the rectum. However, if the woman pushes at this time, the cervix may become oedematous and this would further delay the onset of the second stage of labour. The urge to push may be eased by a change in position and the use of breathing techniques, inhalational analgesia or other methods to enhance relaxation. The woman's partner and the midwife can assist throughout labour with massage and physical support. The woman may choose a range of pain control methods (see Chapter 16) throughout her labour depending on the level and intensity of pain she is experiencing at that time. The midwife must ensure that any delay in labour and fetal or maternal distress are promptly recognized and appropriate referrals made (Nursing and Midwifery Council [NMC] 2012).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Second stage of labour</h4>
                        <p>Full dilatation of the cervix may need to be confirmed by a vaginal examination because moulding and formation of a caput succedaneum may be in view while an anterior lip of cervix remains. The second stage of labour is usually characterized by significant anal dilatation some time before the head is visible. The midwife can encourage the woman to adopt upright positions that may help to shorten the length of the second stage and reduce the need for operative assistance (see Chapter 17). Squatting may increase the transverse diameter of the pelvic outlet which may increase the chance of a vaginal birth.</p>
                        <p>The length of the second stage of labour is usually increased when the occiput is posterior, and there is an increased likelihood of an operative birth (Pearl et al 1993; Gimovsky and Hennigan 1995). In some cases where contractions are weak and ineffective an oxytocin infusion may be administered to stimulate adequate contractions and achieve advancement/descent of the presenting part.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Manual rotation</h3>
                        <p>Manual rotation of the head from occipitoposterior (OP) or occipitotransverse (OT) positions to an anterior position has been shown to reduce the need for assisted birth and caesarean section by correcting the fetal malposition. This will facilitate the descent of the fetal head, to encourage a spontaneous vaginal birth (Shaffer et al 2011).</p>
                        <p>There are two techniques for undertaking manual rotation either by an obstetrician or an experienced and trained midwife. Both techniques require informed consent from the woman and adequate analgesia. The woman's bladder must be empty and the cervix should be fully dilated. Either, constant pressure is exerted with the tips of the fingers against the lambdoidal suture to rotate the fetal head into the occiput anterior position, or the whole hand is introduced into the birth canal and fingers and thumb positioned under the lateral posterior parietal bone and the anterior parietal bone (Phipps et al 2011): the head is then rotated to the anterior position. Using either method, the rotation may take two or three contractions to complete and then should be held for two contractions whilst the woman bears down to reduce the risk of the rotation reverting (Phipps et al 2011; Shaffer et al 2011). If a midwife is practising in a setting where operative birth is not readily available, such as in a birthing centre, this intervention may reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality (Shaffer et al 2011).</p>
                        <p>Malpositions and malpresentations are generally associated with a higher incidence of interventions in labour, complications and instrumental birth (Cheng et al 2006). Immediate and subsequent postnatal care of the woman and her baby following an instrumental birth are discussed in Chapter 21 and Chapter 31.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Mechanism of right occipitoposterior position (long rotation) (Figs 20.7-20.10)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The lie is longitudinal.</li>
                            <li>The attitude of the head is deflexed.</li>
                            <li>The presentation is vertex.</li>
                            <li>The position is right occipitoposterior.</li>
                            <li>The denominator is the occiput.</li>
                            <li>The presenting part is the middle or anterior area of the left parietal bone.</li>
                            <li>The occipitofrontal diameter, 11.5 cm, lies in the right oblique diameter of the pelvic brim. The occiput points to the right sacroiliac joint and the sinciput to the left iliopectineal eminence.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Flexion</h4>
                        <p>Descent takes place with increasing flexion. The occiput becomes the leading part.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Internal rotation of the head</h4>
                        <p>The occiput reaches the pelvic floor first and rotates forwards 3/8 of a circle along the right side of the pelvis to lie under the symphysis pubis. The shoulders follow, turning 2/8 of a circle from the left to the right oblique diameter.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Crowning</h4>
                        <p>The occiput escapes under the symphysis pubis and the head is crowned.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Extension</h4>
                        <p>The sinciput, face and chin sweep the perineum and the head is born by a movement of extension.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Restitution</h4>
                        <p>The occiput turns 1/8 of a circle to the right and the head realigns itself with the shoulders.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Internal rotation of the shoulders</h4>
                        <p>The shoulders enter the pelvis in the right oblique diameter; the anterior shoulder reaches the pelvic floor first and rotates forwards 1/8 of a circle to lie under the symphysis pubis.</p>
                        
                        <h4>External rotation of the head</h4>
                        <p>At the same time the occiput turns a further 1/8 of a circle to the right.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Lateral flexion</h4>
                        <p>The anterior shoulder escapes under the symphysis pubis, the posterior shoulder sweeps the perineum and the body is born by a movement of lateral flexion.</p>

                        <h3>Possible course and outcomes of labour</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Long internal rotation</h4>
                        <p>This is the commonest outcome. With good uterine contractions producing flexion and descent of the head, the occiput will rotate forward 3/8 of a circle as described above.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Short internal rotation</h4>
                        <p>The term persistent occipitoposterior position (Figs 20.11 and 20.12) indicates that the occiput fails to rotate forwards. Instead, the sinciput reaches the pelvic floor first and rotates forwards. As a result, the occiput goes into the hollow of the sacrum. The baby is born facing the pubic bone (face to pubis).</p>
                        
                        <h5>Cause</h5>
                        <p>Failure of flexion: the head descends without increased flexion and the sinciput becomes the leading part. It reaches the pelvic floor first and rotates forwards to lie under the symphysis pubis.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Diagnosis</h5>
                        <p>In the first stage of labour: signs are those of any posterior position of the occiput, namely a deflexed head and a fetal heart heard in the flank or in the midline. Descent is slow.</p>
                        <p>In the second stage of labour: delay is common. On vaginal examination the anterior fontanelle is felt behind the symphysis pubis, but a large caput succedaneum may mask this. If the pinna of the ear is felt pointing towards the woman's sacrum, this indicates a posterior position.</p>
                        <p>The long occipitofrontal diameter causes considerable dilatation of the anus and gaping of the vagina while the fetal head is barely visible, and the broad biparietal diameter distends the perineum and may cause excessive bulging. As the head advances, the anterior fontanelle can be felt just behind the symphysis pubis. Consequently the fetus is born facing the pubis. Characteristic upward moulding is present with the caput succedaneum on the anterior part of the parietal bone (Fig. 20.13).</p>

                        <h5>The birth (Fig 20.14-20.17)</h5>
                        <p>The sinciput will first emerge from under the symphysis pubis as far as the root of the nose and the midwife maintains flexion by restraining it from escaping further than the glabella, allowing the occiput to sweep the perineum and be born. She then extends the head by grasping it and bringing the face down from under the symphysis pubis. Perineal trauma is common and the midwife should watch for signs of rupture in the centre of the perineum (buttonhole tear). An episiotomy may be required, owing to the larger presenting diameters.</p>

                        <h5>Undiagnosed face to pubis</h5>
                        <p>If the signs are not recognized at an earlier stage, the midwife may first be aware that the occiput is posterior when the hairless forehead is seen escaping beneath the pubic arch. Any accidental extension of the fetal head should be corrected by flexion towards the symphysis pubis.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Deep transverse arrest</h4>
                        <p>The head descends with some increase in flexion. The occiput reaches the pelvic floor and begins to rotate forwards. Flexion is not maintained and the occipito-frontal diameter becomes caught at the narrow bi-spinous diameter of the outlet. Arrest may be due to weak contractions, a straight sacrum or a narrowed pelvic outlet.</p>
                        <p>The sagittal suture is found in the transverse diameter of the pelvis and both fontanelles are palpable. Neither sinciput nor occiput leads. The head is deep in the pelvic cavity at the level of the ischial spines although the caput may be lower still. There is no advance and obstetric assistance will be required. Manual rotation may be attempted first, and then vaginal birth may follow with the woman's effort.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Management</h4>
                        <p>The woman must be kept informed of progress and participate in decisions. Pushing at this time may not resolve the problem but the midwife and the woman's partner can help by encouraging 'sigh out slowly' (SOS) breathing. A change of position may help to overcome the urge to bear down (see Chapter 17).</p>
                        <p>Where assistance is needed for a safe birth the woman's informed consent is required. The procedure would be undertaken under local, regional or more rarely general anaesthesia (see Chapter 21) considering the choice of the woman, her condition and that of her unborn baby. The baby's head will be brought into an anterior position and the birth completed using forceps or vacuum extraction (see Chapter 21).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Conversion to face or brow presentation</h4>
                        <p>When the head is deflexed at the onset of labour, extension occasionally occurs instead of flexion. If extension is complete then a face presentation results, but if incomplete, the head is arrested at the brim with the brow presenting. This is a rare complication of posterior positions, and is more commonly found in multigravidae.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Complications</h3>
                        <p>Apart from prolonged labour with its attendant risks to the woman and fetus and the increased likelihood of instrumental birth, there are a number of complications that may occur which the midwife should consider.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Obstructed labour</h4>
                        <p>This may occur when the head is deflexed or partially extended and becomes impacted in the pelvis (see Chapter 19).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Maternal trauma</h4>
                        <p>A forceps birth will result in perineal bruising and trauma. Birth of a baby in the persistent occipitoposterior position, particularly if previously undiagnosed, may cause a third or fourth degree tear (Melamed et al 2013).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Neonatal trauma</h4>
                        <p>The unfavourable upward moulding of the fetal skull, found in an occipitoposterior position, can cause intracranial haemorrhage, as a result of the falx cerebri being pulled away from the tentorium cerebelli. The larger presenting diameters also predispose to a greater degree of compression. Cerebral haemorrhage (see Chapter 31) may also result from chronic hypoxia, which may accompany prolonged labour.</p>
                        <p>Neonatal trauma occurring following birth from an occipitoposterior position has also been associated with forceps or ventouse births.</p>

                        <p>When the attitude of the head is one of complete extension, the occiput of the fetus will be in contact with its spine and the face will present. The incidence is about ≤ 1:500 (Bhal et al 1998; Akmal and Paterson-Brown 2009) and the majority develop during labour from vertex presentations with the occiput posterior; this is termed secondary face presentation. Less commonly, the face presents before labour; this is termed primary face presentation. There are six positions in a face presentation; the denominator is the mentum and the presenting diameters are the submentobregmatic (9.5 cm) and the bitemporal (8.2 cm) (Figs 20.18-20.23).</p>

                        <h3>Causes</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Anterior obliquity of the uterus</h4>
                        <p>The uterus of a multigravida with slack abdominal muscles and a pendulous abdomen will lean forward and alter the direction of the uterine axis. This causes the fetal buttocks to lean forwards and the force of the contractions to be directed in a line towards the chin rather than the occiput, resulting in extension of the head.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Contracted pelvis</h4>
                        <p>In the flat pelvis, the head enters in the transverse diameter of the brim and the parietal eminences may be held up in the obstetrical conjugate causing the head to become extended such that a face presentation develops. Alternatively, if the head is in the posterior position with the vertex presenting, and remains deflexed, the parietal eminences may be caught in the sacrocotyloid dimension of the maternal pelvis so that the occiput cannot descend, and the head becomes extended resulting in a face presentation. This is more likely in the presence of an android pelvis, in which the sacrocotyloid dimension is reduced.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Hydramnios (polyhydramnios)</h4>
                        <p>If the vertex is presenting and the membranes rupture spontaneously, the resulting rush of an excess of amniotic fluid may cause the head to extend as it sinks into the lower uterine segment.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Congenital malformation</h4>
                        <p>Anencephaly can be a fetal cause of a face presentation. In a cephalic presentation, because the vertex is absent the face is thrust forward and presents. More rarely, a tumour of the fetal neck may cause extension of the head.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Antenatal diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>Antenatal diagnosis is rare since face presentation develops during labour in the majority of cases. A cephalic presentation in a known anencephalic fetus may be presumed to be a face presentation.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Intrapartum diagnosis</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Abdominal palpation</h4>
                        <p>Face presentation may not be detected, especially if the mentum is anterior. The occiput feels prominent, with a groove between the head and back, but it may be mistaken for the sinciput. The limbs may be palpated on the side opposite to the occiput and the fetal heart is best heard through the fetal chest on the same side as the limbs. In a mentoposterior position the fetal heart is difficult to hear because the fetal chest is in contact with the maternal spine (Fig. 20.24).</p>

                        <h4>Vaginal examination</h4>
                        <p>The presenting part is high, soft and irregular. When the cervix is sufficiently dilated, the orbital ridges, eyes, nose and mouth may be felt. However, confusion between the mouth and anus could arise. The mouth may be open, and the hard gums are diagnostic with the possibility of the fetus sucking the examining finger. As labour progresses the face becomes oedematous, making it more difficult to distinguish from a breech presentation. To determine the position the mentum must be located. If it is posterior, the midwife should decide whether it is lower than the sinciput, and if it can advance, it will rotate forwards. In a left mentoanterior position, the orbital ridges will be in the left oblique diameter of the pelvis (Fig. 20.25). Care must be taken not to injure or infect the eyes with the examining finger.</p>

                        <h3>Mechanism of a left mentoanterior position</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The lie is longitudinal.</li>
                            <li>The attitude is one of extension of the fetal head and neck.</li>
                            <li>The presentation is the face (Fig. 20.26).</li>
                            <li>The position is left mentoanterior.</li>
                            <li>The denominator is the mentum.</li>
                            <li>The presenting part is the left malar bone.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Extension</h4>
                        <p>Descent takes place with increasing extension. The mentum becomes the leading part.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Internal rotation of the head</h4>
                        <p>This occurs when the chin reaches the pelvic floor and rotates forwards 1/8 of a circle. The chin escapes under the symphysis pubis (Fig. 20.27A).</p>

                        <h4>Flexion</h4>
                        <p>This takes place and the sinciput, vertex and occiput sweep the perineum; the head is born (Fig. 20.27B).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Restitution</h4>
                        <p>This occurs when the chin turns 1/8 of a circle to the woman's left side.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Internal rotation of the shoulders</h4>
                        <p>The shoulders enter the pelvis in the left oblique diameter of the maternal pelvis and the anterior shoulder reaches the pelvic floor first, rotating forwards 1/8 of a circle along the right side of the pelvis.</p>
                        
                        <h4>External rotation of the head</h4>
                        <p>This occurs simultaneously. The chin moves a further 1/8 of a circle to the left.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Lateral flexion</h4>
                        <p>The anterior shoulder escapes under the symphysis pubis, the posterior shoulder sweeps the perineum and the baby's body is born by a movement of lateral flexion.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Possible course and outcomes of labour</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Prolonged labour</h4>
                        <p>Labour is often prolonged because the face is an ill-fitting presenting part and does not therefore stimulate effective uterine contractions. The woman should be kept informed of her progress and any proposed intervention throughout labour.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the facial bones do not mould and, in order to enable the mentum to reach the pelvic floor and rotate forwards, the shoulders must enter the pelvic cavity at the same time as the head. The fetal axis pressure is directed to the chin and the head is extended almost at right-angles to the spine, increasing the diameters to be accommodated in the pelvis.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Mentoanterior positions</h4>
                        <p>With good uterine contractions, descent and rotation of the head occur (Fig. 20.27) and labour progresses to a spontaneous birth as described below.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Mentoposterior positions</h4>
                        <p>If the head is completely extended, so that the mentum reaches the pelvic floor first, and the contractions are effective, the mentum will rotate forwards and the position becomes anterior.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_28_c51b551507f57ce861a5g-466-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing a persistent mentoposterior position where the fetal chin is in the hollow of the sacrum." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Fig. 20.28 Persistent mentoposterior position.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        
                        <h4>Persistent mentoposterior position</h4>
                        <p>In this case, the head is incompletely extended and the sinciput reaches the pelvic floor first and rotates forwards 1/8 of a circle, which brings the chin into the hollow of the sacrum (Fig. 20.28). There is no further mechanism. The face becomes impacted because, in order to descend further, both head and chest would have to be accommodated in the pelvis. Whatever emerges anteriorly from the vagina must pivot around the subpubic arch. When the chin is posterior this is impossible because the head can extend no further.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Reversal of face presentation</h4>
                        <p>A face presentation in a persistent mentoposterior position may, in some cases, be manipulated to an occipitoanterior position using bimanual pressure (Neuman et al 1994; Gimovsky and Hennigan 1995). This method was developed to reduce the likelihood of an operative birth for those women who refused caesarean section. Using a tocolytic drug, such as terbutaline, to relax the uterus, the fetal head is disengaged using upward transvaginal pressure. The fetal head is then flexed with bimanual pressure under ultrasound guidance to achieve an occipitoanterior position.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Management of labour</h3>
                        
                        <h4>First stage of labour</h4>
                        <p>Upon diagnosis of a face presentation, the midwife should inform the doctor of this deviation from the normal. Routine observations of maternal and fetal conditions are made as in a normal physiological labour (see Chapter 16). A fetal scalp electrode must not be applied, and care should be taken not to infect or injure the eyes during vaginal examinations.</p>
                        <p>Immediately following rupture of the membranes, a vaginal examination should be performed to exclude cord prolapse which is more likely because the face is an ill-fitting presenting part. Descent of the fetal head should be assessed abdominally, and careful vaginal examination performed every 2-4 hours to determine cervical dilatation and descent of the head.</p>
                        <p>In mentoposterior positions the midwife should note whether the mentum is lower than the sinciput, since rotation and descent depend on this. If the head remains high in spite of good contractions, caesarean section is likely. The woman may be prescribed oral ranitidine, 150 mg every 6 hours throughout labour if it is considered that an anaesthetic may be necessary.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Birth of the head (Fig. 20.29)</h4>
                        <p>When the face appears at the vulva, extension must be maintained by holding back the sinciput and permitting the mentum to escape under the symphysis pubis before the occiput is allowed to sweep the perineum. In this way, the submentovertical diameter (11.5 cm) instead of the mentovertical diameter (13.5 cm) distends the vaginal orifice. Because the perineum is also distended by the biparietal diameter (9.5 cm), an elective episiotomy may be performed to avoid extensive perineal lacerations.</p>
                        <p>If the head does not descend in the second stage of labour, the doctor should be informed. In a mentoanterior position it may be possible for the obstetrician to assist the baby's birth with forceps when rotation is incomplete. If the position remains mentoposterior, the head has become impacted, or there is any suspicion of disproportion, a caesarean section will be necessary.</p>

                        <h3>Complications</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Obstructed labour</h4>
                        <p>Because the face, unlike the vertex, does not mould, a minor degree of pelvic contraction may result in obstructed labour (see Chapter 19). In a persistent mentoposterior position the face becomes impacted and caesarean section is necessary.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Cord prolapse</h4>
                        <p>A prolapsed cord is more common when the membranes rupture because the face is an ill-fitting presenting part. The midwife should always perform a vaginal examination when the membranes rupture to rule out cord prolapse (see Chapter 22).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Facial bruising</h4>
                        <p>The baby's face is always bruised and swollen at birth, with oedematous eyelids and lips. The head is elongated (Fig. 20.30) and the baby will initially lie with the head extended. The midwife should warn the parents in advance of the baby's battered appearance, reassuring them that this is only temporary as the oedema will disappear within 1 or 2 days, with the bruising usually resolving within a week. Trauma during labour may cause tracheal and laryngeal oedema immediately after the birth, which can result in neonatal respiratory distress. In addition, fetal anomalies or tumours, such as fetal goiters that may have contributed to fetal malpresentation, may make intubation difficult. As a result, a clinician with expertise in neonatal resuscitation should be present at the birth.</p>

                        <h4>Cerebral haemorrhage</h4>
                        <p>The lack of moulding of the facial bones can lead to intracranial haemorrhage caused by excessive compression of the fetal skull or by rearward compression, in the typical moulding of the fetal skull found in this presentation (Fig. 20.30).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Maternal trauma</h4>
                        <p>Extensive perineal lacerations may occur at birth owing to the large submentovertical and biparietal diameters distending the vagina and perineum. There is an increased incidence of operative birth by either forceps or by caesarean section, both of which increase maternal morbidity.</p>
