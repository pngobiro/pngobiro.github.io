                        <p>The third stage of labour is a time of profound relief for most women, following on the exertions of labour and birth. During this stage, mother, baby and father come together as a family unit for the first time; parents explore and become familiar with their newborn, marvel at their baby's behaviour and relax. The physical mechanisms of birth continue almost unnoticed, and the placenta and membranes are expelled. Until the third stage is complete, continued vigilance on the part of the midwife is essential to ensure that postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is prevented or treated early, and that the placenta and membranes are born intact. PPH is ranked among the top four major causes of maternal death globally (World Health Organization [WHO] 2012). Although the majority (99%) of deaths reported occur in developing countries, the risk of PPH should not be underestimated for any birth, and PPH is at present the sixth leading cause of direct maternal death in the United Kingdom (UK) (Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries [CMACE] 2011). Maternal mortality rates in high resource countries are relatively low when compared to low resource countries; however, maternal morbidity is similar in significance and rates of PPH are increasing world-wide (Knight et al 2009). To facilitate a healthy, enjoyable outcome for mother and baby, good antenatal health plus preparation, coupled with skilled, evidence-based practice of the midwife are crucial.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-1" class="section-heading">PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The third stage can be defined as the period from the birth of the baby to complete expulsion of the placenta and membranes. It involves the development of the relationship between mother, baby and father, the separation, descent and expulsion of the placenta and membranes, the control of haemorrhage from the placenta site, and sometimes, the initiation of breast-feeding. Although traditionally labour is divided into three distinct component parts to aid comprehension, it should be viewed as one continuous process. With this in mind, it is important to understand that the physiology of the third stage depends, in part, on what has happened during pregnancy as well as during the first and second stage of labour, and on the woman's basic level of health and wellbeing. The midwife's knowledge and evidence-based skills play a crucial role in ensuring that the care received by the woman works with, not against, physiological processes.</p>
                        <p>The placenta may shear off during the final expulsive contractions accompanying the birth of the baby or remain adherent for some time. The third stage usually lasts between 5 and 15 minutes, but any period up to 1 hour may be considered normal.</p>
                        <h3>Separation and descent of the placenta</h3>
                        <h4>Mechanical factors</h4>
                        <p>The unique characteristic of uterine muscle lies in its power of retraction. During the second stage of labour, the uterine cavity progressively empties as the baby moves down, enabling the retraction process to accelerate. Thus, by the beginning of the third stage, the placental site has already diminished in area by about 75% (Baldock and Dixon 2006). As this occurs, the placenta becomes compressed and the blood in the intervillous spaces is forced back into the spongy layer of the decidua basalis. Retraction of the oblique uterine muscle fibres exerts pressure on the blood vessels so that blood does not drain back into the maternal system. The vessels during this process become tense and congested. With the next contraction the distended veins burst and a small amount of blood seeps in between the thin septa of the spongy layer and the placental surface, stripping it from its attachment (Fig. 18.1). As the surface area for placental attachment reduces, the relatively non-elastic placenta begins to detach from the uterine wall.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>The majority of placentas are situated on the anterior or posterior wall of the uterus, and separation usually starts from the lower pole of the placenta and moves gradually upwards (Herman et al 2002). Fundal placentas separate first at both poles, followed by the fundal part. The length of the third stage may be approximately 2 minutes shorter when the placenta is located at the fundus (Altay et al 2007). If separation begins centrally, a retroplacental clot is formed (Fig. 18.2). This further aids separation by exerting pressure at the midpoint of placental attachment so that the increased weight helps to strip the adherent lateral borders and peel the membranes off the uterine wall so that the clot thus formed becomes enclosed in a membranous bag as the placenta descends, fetal surface first. This process of separation (first described by Schultze) is associated with more complete shearing of both placenta and membranes and less fluid blood loss (Fig. 18.3A). If the placenta begins to detach unevenly at one of its lateral borders, the blood escapes so that separation is unaided by the formation of a retroplacental clot. The placenta descends, slipping sideways, maternal surface first. This process (first described by Matthews Duncan in the nineteenth century) takes longer and is associated with ragged, incomplete expulsion of the membranes and a higher fluid blood loss (Fig. 18.3B).</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Once separation has occurred the uterus contracts strongly, forcing placenta and membranes to fall into the lower uterine segment (Fig. 18.4), and finally, into the vagina.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Haemostasis</h4>
                        <p>The normal volume of blood flow through the placental site is 500-800 ml/min, but this is considerably reduced once the baby is born and the placental site on the uterine wall has diminished (Baldock and Dixon 2006). At placental separation, blood flow has to be arrested swiftly, or serious haemorrhage can occur. The interplay of four factors within the normal physiological processes that control bleeding are critical in minimizing blood loss and preventing maternal morbidity or mortality. They are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Retraction of the oblique uterine muscle fibres in the upper uterine segment through which the tortuous blood vessels intertwine - the resultant thickening of the muscles exerts pressure on the torn vessels, acting as clamps, and preventing haemorrhage (see Fig. 18.1). It is the absence of oblique fibres in the lower uterine segment that explains the greatly increased blood loss usually accompanying placental separation in placenta praevia.</li>
                            <li>The presence of vigorous uterine contraction following separation - this brings the walls into apposition so that further pressure is exerted on the placental site.</li>
                            <li>The achievement of haemostasis - there is a transitory activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems during, and immediately following, placental separation. It is believed that this protective response is especially active at the placental site so that clot formation in the torn vessels is intensified. Following separation, the placental site is rapidly covered by a fibrin mesh utilizing 5-10% of circulating fibrinogen.</li>
                            <li>Breast-feeding - the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary in response to skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby, and the baby's nuzzling at the breast, causes uterine contractions.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-2" class="section-heading">CARING FOR A WOMAN IN THE THIRD STAGE OF LABOUR</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Two methods of care may be used during the third stage, expectant (physiological) care or active management. It is ultimately the woman's decision as to how she would, ideally, like her birth plan to be followed in the third stage. She may have philosophical, religious or cultural beliefs that influence her decision. The attending midwife may also have views, based on evidence, as to the ideal method of care for each particular woman. Midwives should ensure that, in order to facilitate informed decision-making by the woman, adequate time for deliberation and questions is made available, where possible, during the course of her routine antenatal consultations. The best available research information on care during the third stage of labour should be offered in an objective manner (Begley et al 2011), supported by written information on possible care options for the woman in keeping with the setting in which she intends to birth. Information on types of uterotonics, explanation of their different routes of administration, benefits, risks and side-effects involved, and timing and method of placental birth or delivery should be given.</p>
                        <p>The midwife's care of the mother should be based on an understanding of the normal physiological processes at work, including having access to as much information as possible about the woman's pregnancy and labour history. Progress of the first and second stages of labour are likely to impact on management of the third stage of labour and should not be reviewed in isolation. The midwife's actions can make the third stage a wonderful, relaxing time of birth and can reduce the risks of haemorrhage, infection, retained placenta and shock, any of which may increase maternal morbidity and even result in death. A mother's ability to withstand complications in the third stage depends, to a large degree, upon her general health and the avoidance of debilitating, predisposing problems, such as anaemia, ketosis, exhaustion and prolonged hypotonic uterine action. Factors that may influence the risk of haemorrhage are discussed in more detail later.</p>
                        <p>Detailed, accurate, written (contemporaneous wherever possible) documentation is extremely important in all aspects of care, particularly in areas where evidence-based information is relied upon to assess whether due care has been delivered. In the case of third stage management, two examples might be: where a woman requests expectant (physiological) management of the third stage of labour (EMTSL), the midwife should clarify the circumstances in which this decision may be reversed (e.g. if severe bleeding should occur); where a woman requests active management (AMTSL), the midwife should clarify the circumstances in which this decision may be reversed (e.g., if the baby requires attention and the placenta separates before a uterotonic has been given). The woman's preference for care must be recorded in her notes antenatally, and a record of the discussion may be signed by the woman. It would be prudent for midwives to notify their supervisor of midwives (SoM), clinical manager or the attending medical practitioner if any of the woman's requests are contrary to local guidelines.</p>
                        <h3>Expectant (or physiological) care during the third stage of labour (EMTSL)</h3>
                        <p>In expectant management, the normal, physiological mechanisms of labour are supported and no routine actions (such as administration of a uterotonic drug, or clamping of the umbilical cord) are carried out. A study of the reported actions of 27 expert midwives (who used EMTSL in at least 30% of births, and had recorded PPH rates of less than 4%) identified the key actions that they believed led to success when using EMTSL (Begley et al 2012). A synthesis of these actions, some of which are supported by other research also, provides the following instructions for best practice when using EMTSL:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Maintain a calm, quiet, warm environment. Use warmed sheets or blankets to wrap mother and baby together, skin-to-skin. This close contact, and the baby's eventual nuzzling at the breast, will stimulate oxytocin release, which may shorten the third stage and increase breast-feeding on discharge (Marín Gabriel et al 2010).</li>
                            <li>Maintain the woman in a comfortable, semi-upright position (at least a 45° angle) to encourage placental separation by maintaining a gentle downward weight.</li>
                            <li>Facilitate this time of parent-baby discovery and attachment by keeping quiet, observing from a distance and not interfering with the physiological processes.</li>
                            <li>Watch and wait. Take cues from the woman's behaviour; if she is alert and happy, examining the baby and talking, she is not bleeding excessively or in need of any intervention. Reassurance can also be obtained from discretely checking the woman's pulse if there is any anxiety in, for example, a prolonged third stage.</li>
                            <li>Signs of placental separation:

                                    <li>The woman may fidget, make a face, or state that she has a contraction.</li>
                                    <li>A large 'gush' of blood may follow, indicating partial or complete separation of the placenta. It usually ceases after 10-20 seconds, especially if the placenta has separated completely and the uterus has contracted well. This gush is larger than that seen when a uterotonic is given routinely, and midwives need to develop an understanding of this physiological blood loss and not rush to administer oxytocic treatment unnecessarily.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Signs of placental descent:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The woman may wriggle, change position, or complain of pressure, or a pain, in her back or bottom.</li>
                                    <li>The cord may lengthen and/or the walls of the vulva may bulge as the placenta descends.</li>
                                    <li>The uterus becomes hard, round and mobile (Fig. 18.5). This can be seen visually, or by the fact that the baby, resting on the mother's abdomen, has moved downwards. It is inadvisable to touch or manipulate the uterus at this stage, as this can prevent full contraction, disturb the fibrin mesh, and cause excessive bleeding. If there is concern that the uterus may be filling up with blood (a concealed haemorrhage), a gentle hand placed on the fundus will detect if there is a large, soft, uncontracted uterus.</li>

                            <li>Birthing the placenta:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Gravity should be used during the birth of the placenta by encouraging a truly upright position: sitting on a birthing stool, standing up in the birthing pool or on the birthing mat, walking out to the toilet, sitting on the toilet, kneeling upright or squatting over a bedpan. A basin, bin bag or disposable sheet can be placed strategically over, or in, the pan of the toilet to receive the placenta. It should be noted that such positions increase visible blood loss (Gupta and Nikodem 2002).</li>
                                    <li>Maternal effort can be used to expedite expulsion, and most women will push the placenta out as soon as they feel pressure, with little effort.</li>
                                    <li>The cord should be left unclamped until pulsation ceases (McDonald et al 2013), or until after the birth of the placenta, unless the mother wishes it to be cut earlier. Any mild resuscitation of the baby can be done at the site of birth, with the benefit of continued oxygen flow to the baby through the umbilical cord.</li>
                                    <li>If the placenta is definitely separated and is sitting just inside the vagina (i.e., the insertion of the cord can be seen at the vulva, or the cord has lengthened and the vulval walls are bulging) the midwife may ease gently on the cord to help lift out the placenta. This is not controlled cord traction as no force is used, the placenta is separated and has left the uterus, therefore no counter-pressure is required on the abdomen as there is no risk of uterine inversion. Controlled cord traction should NEVER be used in the absence of a well contracted uterus following uterotonic administration.</li>
                                    <li>Trailing membranes should be teased out gently, by turning the placenta around and twisting them into a 'rope', thus stripping the ends gently from the uterine wall.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>At any time, a uterotonic may be administered to control haemorrhage, or if uterine tone is poor following placental birth. It is preferable to withhold administration until the placenta is delivered, if possible, to avoid the risk of a retained placenta when the uterus contracts strongly in response to the treatment.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This spontaneous process can take from 10 minutes to 1 hour to complete, with a median of 13 minutes (Begley 1990). If the placenta remains undelivered for a prolonged period, the risk of bleeding becomes greater because the uterus cannot contract down fully while the bulk of the placenta is in situ. Dombrowski et al (1995) found that the frequency of haemorrhage increased between 10 minutes and 40 minutes after the birth of the baby. However, patience and confidence not to interfere unnecessarily are required on the part of the midwife to secure a successful conclusion. Early attachment of the baby to the breast may enhance these physiological changes by stimulating the reflex release of oxytocin from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, which helps to secure good uterine action.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Active management of the third stage of labour (AMTSL)</h3>
                        <p>An active management policy usually includes the routine prophylactic administration of a uterotonic agent, either intravenously, intramuscularly or (occasionally) orally, as a precautionary measure aimed at reducing the risk of postpartum haemorrhage. It is applied regardless of the assessed obstetric risk status of the woman, and is usually undertaken in conjunction with clamping of the umbilical cord shortly after birth of the baby and delivery of the placenta by the use of controlled cord traction. In situations where women may also be assessed as being at higher risk for PPH (e.g. multiple birth), a prophylactic infusion of larger doses of uterotonics diluted in intravenous solutions may be administered over several hours following the birth. This would also be considered to be part of an active management policy, as would routine uterine massage following delivery of the placenta in some countries (Jangsten et al 2011), although there is no evidence to support this practice once an oxytocic has been given (Hofmeyer et al 2013).</p>
                        <p>Active management in the third stage is the policy of third stage labour management most widely practised throughout the developed world. Like all interventions performed, skill in assisting the delivery of the placenta and membranes is extremely important to prevent complications. Whether women should routinely receive uterotonic drugs, have the umbilical cord clamped or be given assistance with placental delivery has been the subject of a great deal of debate and many research trials. These three aspects are considered separately here.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Administration of uterotonics</h4>
                        <p>Uterotonics (also known as oxytocics, or ecbolics), are drugs (e.g. Syntometrine, Syntocinon, ergometrine and prostaglandins) that stimulate the smooth muscle of the uterus to contract. They may be administered with crowning of the baby's head, at the birth of the anterior shoulder of the baby, after the birth of the baby but prior to placental expulsion, or following the birth, or delivery, of the placenta and membranes.</p>
                        <p>In practice, one of the following uterotonic drugs is usually used.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Intravenous ergometrine 0.25-0.5 mg</h5>
                        <p>This drug acts within 45 seconds, and is particularly useful in securing a rapid contraction where hypotonic uterine action results in haemorrhage. If a doctor is not present in such an emergency, a midwife may give the injection, if it is within his/her scope of practice. There is no evidence for the continued routine use of intravenous ergometrine, which is associated with an increased risk of retained placenta (Prendiville et al 1988; Begley 1990), so this drug is more often used to treat a PPH rather than as a prophylactic drug. If an intravenous cannula is not already in situ, any difficulty encountered in locating a vein or sudden movement by the woman may result in failed venepuncture or at least a delay in administration. Ergometrine can cause headache, nausea, vomiting and an increase in blood pressure (Begley 1990) and it is contraindicated where there is a history of hypertensive disorder or cardiac disease (Dyer et al 2010). To decrease the chance of nausea and vomiting when the woman has had a caesarean section under epidural, it is advisable not to use ergometrine on its own (Balki and Carvalho 2005).</p>
                        
                        <h5>Combined ergometrine and oxytocin (a commonly used brand is Syntometrine)</h5>
                        <p>A 1 ml ampoule contains 5 IU of oxytocin and 0.5 mg ergometrine and is administered by i.m. injection. The oxytocin acts within 2.5 min, and the ergometrine within 6-7 min (Fig. 18.6). Their combined action results in a rapid uterine contraction enhanced by a stronger, more sustained contraction lasting several hours. It can be administered as the anterior shoulder of the baby is born, or after the birth of the baby. The use of combined ergometrine/oxytocin or any ergometrine-based drug is associated with side-effects such as elevation of blood pressure, nausea and vomiting (Begley 1990). The most recent report on maternal deaths from the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries in the UK states that 'Syntometrine should be avoided as a routine drug completely' (CMACE 2011: 69).</p>
                        <aside class="callout warning" role="alert">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">CAUTION</h4>
                            <p>No more than two doses of ergometrine 0.5 mg should be given, due to its side-effects.</p>
                        </aside>
                        
                        <h5>Oxytocin</h5>
                        <p>Oxytocin (a commonly used brand is Syntocinon) is a synthetic form of the natural oxytocin produced in the posterior pituitary, and is safe to use in a wider context than combined ergometrine/oxytocin agents. It can be administered as an intravenous and or intramuscular injection. However, an intravenous bolus of oxytocin can cause profound, fatal hypotension, especially in the presence of cardiovascular compromise. The recommendation of the Confidential Enquiry in Maternal Deaths (Lewis and Drife 2001: 21) is that 'when given as an intravenous bolus the drug should be given slowly in a dose of not more than 5 IU'.</p>
                        <p>Research evidence to date suggests that oxytocin is an effective uterotonic choice where routine prophylactic management of the third stage of labour is practised (Khan et al 1995; Cotter et al 2001; Choy et al 2002), more specifically in women who experience a blood loss exceeding 1000 ml. Two Cochrane reviews have suggested that it is probably better to use oxytocin rather than ergometrine, due to the side-effects of ergot (Cotter et al 2001; Liabsuetrakul et al 2007).</p>
                        <p>Carbetocin, originally developed for veterinary use and not widely employed for prophylactic use in management of the third stage, is a long-acting synthetic oxytocin analogue which can be administered as a single-dose 100 mg injection. Carbetocin has been shown in some trials to be as effective as oxytocin in preventing PPH (Reyes et al 2011; Su et al 2012); however, it does require refrigeration for stability.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Prostaglandins</h5>
                        <p>The use of prostaglandins for third stage management has up until now been more often associated with the treatment of postpartum haemorrhage than with prophylaxis. This may be partly due to prostaglandin agents being more expensive and associated with side-effects, such as diarrhoea (Anderson and Etches 2007) and cardiovascular complications of increased stroke volume and heart rate (van Selm et al 1995).</p>
                        <p>In more recent years, a great deal of research time and investment has been invested in seeking alternate ways of implementing strategies to reduce the risk of PPH. Misoprostol (a prostaglandin E1 analogue) was first used to treat gastric ulcers, but when its potential as a uterotonic agent was discovered, optimism regarding its suitability in low resource settings was high. It is cheap, not prone to loss of potency, does not need to be sterile or refrigerated and can be administered vaginally, orally or rectally, negating the need for syringes. Misoprostol orally or sublingually (400-600 µg) appears to be a useful drug to prevent PPH, but is not as effective as Syntocinon (Ng et al 2007; Tunçalp et al 2012) and has unpleasant side-effects, such as severe shivering and higher temperature, both of which are transient but unacceptable to some women. Its use appears to be no more likely than Syntocinon to necessitate manual removal of the placenta. Even though the recommendation of the latest Cochrane review is that misoprostol should not replace other uterotonics, the authors suggest that it may be useful in circumstances where nothing else is available (Tunçalp et al 2012).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Clamping of the umbilical cord</h4>
                        <p>This may, necessarily, be carried out following birth of the baby's head if the cord is tightly around the neck; however, it is preferable, and usually possible, to loosen the loop and slip it over the baby's head, then allow the baby's body to slip out beside the loop. If the cord is looped several times around the neck it will be possible to gently tighten one, or more, of the loops of cord and then ease a looser loop over the baby's head. In this way, the baby's oxygen supply is not cut off prematurely, which could be very detrimental to their condition. If this is not successful, the midwife can be ready to clamp and cut the cord just as the woman starts a contraction, so that the oxygen supply is cut off only just before the birth.</p>
                        <p>Early clamping of the cord, as part of active management of the third stage of labour (AMTSL), is normally applied in the first 30 seconds to 3 minutes after birth, regardless of whether or not cord pulsation has ceased. It has been suggested that this practice may have the following effects:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It may reduce the volume of blood returning to the fetus by an amount between 75 and 125 ml (van Rheenen and Brabin 2004; Farrar et al 2011), which is 30-40% of total potential blood volume (Farrar et al 2011).</li>
                            <li>It may prematurely interrupt the respiratory function of the placenta in maintaining O<sub>2</sub> levels and combating acidosis in the early moments of life. This may be of particular importance in a baby who is slow to breathe.</li>
                            <li>It may result in lower neonatal bilirubin levels, although the effect on the incidence of clinical jaundice is unclear (McDonald et al 2013).</li>
                            <li>It may increase the likelihood of fetomaternal transfusion as a larger volume of blood remains in the placenta. Venous pressure is further increased as retraction continues and may be sufficiently high to rupture surface placental vessels, thus facilitating the transfer of fetal cells into the maternal system; this may be a critical factor where the mother's blood group is Rhesus negative (see Chapter 10).</li>
                            <li>It results in the truncated umbilical vessels containing a quantity of clotted blood, which provides an ideal medium for bacterial growth; as this is near to, and has a patent opening into, the baby's abdomen there is potential for systemic infection (Mercer et al 2006).</li>
                            <li>Heavier placental weight has also been associated with early cord clamping (Newton et al 1961), which may cause difficulty with delivery of the placenta, particularly when the cervix has contracted following administration of a uterotonic.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Proponents of late clamping suggest that no action be taken until cord pulsation ceases or the placenta has been completely delivered, thus allowing the physiological processes to take place without intervention. Suggested advantages of late clamping include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The route to the low resistance placental circulation remains patent, which provides the newborn with a safety valve for any raised systemic blood pressure. This may be critical when the baby is preterm or asphyxiated, as raised pulmonary and central venous pressures may exacerbate the difficulties in initiating respiration and accompanying circulatory adaptation (Dunn 1985).</li>
                            <li>The transfusion of the full quota of placental blood to the newborn. This may constitute as much as 30-40% of the circulating volume (Farrar et al 2011), depending on when the cord is clamped and at what level the baby is held prior to clamping and may therefore be important in maintaining haematocrit levels.</li>
                            <li>The neonatal effects associated with increased placental transfusion include higher mean birth weight by 87-116 g (Farrar et al 2011) and higher neonatal haematocrit accompanied by an increase in the incidence of jaundice in term (McDonald et al 2013) and preterm babies (Rabe et al 2012). There is growing evidence that delaying cord clamping confers improved iron status in infants up to 6 months post-birth (Chaparro et al 2006; Mercer 2006; Hutton and Hassan 2007; Rabe et al 2012; McDonald et al 2013).</li>
                            <li>Delayed cord clamping in preterm babies (until at least 30-120 seconds) is associated with babies requiring fewer transfusions, and having a lower risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis or intraventricular haemorrhage (Rabe et al 2012).</li>
                            <li>Delayed cord clamping may decrease the risk of fetomaternal transfusion, which is important in women with Rhesus-negative blood (Wiberg et al 2008).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Given the benefits of delayed cord clamping and the documented harms caused by early clamping, many centres have now stopped using early cord clamping as part of their active management package (Afaifel and Weeks 2012).</p>
                        <p>The actual action to take when clamping the cord early is to place one clamp (usually a disposable plastic one) close to the baby's navel end. Care should be taken to apply the clamp 3-4 cm clear of the abdominal wall, to avoid pinching the skin or clamping a portion of gut, which, in rare instances, may be in the cord. A greater length of cord is left when umbilical vessels are needed for transfusion, for example in preterm babies and cases of Rhesus haemolytic disease. The second clamp is placed closer to the placental end of the cord, with approximately 2-4 cm between them. The cord between the two clamps is then cut, while shielding personnel from blood spurts with a gloved hand. The baby may then be placed on the mother's abdomen, put to the breast or be more closely examined on a warmed cot if resuscitation is required.</p>
                        <p>There is very little evidence concerning how much, if any, of a uterotonic agent the baby receives following birth, through an intact cord. In five documented cases of accidental administration of an adult dose of Syntometrine to a newborn infant, no long-term adverse effects were reported (Whitfield and Salfield 1980). If the cord is clamped and cut soon after birth, the midwife should release the second clamp and drain blood from the maternal end of the cord to simulate placental-fetal transfusion, as this may reduce maternal blood loss up to 77 ml and shorten the third stage by up to 3 minutes (Soltani et al 2011).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Delivery of the placenta and membranes</h4>
                        
                        <h5>Controlled cord traction (CCT)</h5>
                        <p>Recent research has shown that this manoeuvre has no effect on severe haemorrhage (>1000 ml) and little, if any, effect on mild PPH (>500 ml) in both high (Deneux-Tharaux et al 2013) and low income settings (Gülmezoglu et al 2012). It does, however, shorten the third stage of labour by 6 minutes (Gülmezoglu et al 2012). This means that, in developing countries in particular, oxytocin can be given by healthcare workers, without the need to train them in safe utilization of CCT (Gülmezoglu et al 2012), providing that they are taught to avoid manipulating the uterus or pulling on the cord.</p>
                        <p>If CCT is to be used successfully, the principles of placental separation described at the beginning of this chapter should be clearly understood. Before proceeding, the midwife should check:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>that a uterotonic drug has been administered</li>
                            <li>that it has been given time to act</li>
                            <li>that the uterus is well contracted</li>
                            <li>that counter-traction is applied</li>
                            <li>that signs of placental separation and descent are present.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>At the beginning of the third stage, a strong uterine contraction results in the fundus being palpable below the umbilicus (see Fig. 18.5). It feels broad as the placenta is still in the upper segment. As the placenta separates and falls into the lower uterine segment there is a small fresh blood loss, the cord lengthens, and the fundus becomes rounder, smaller and more mobile as it rises in the abdomen above the level of the placenta.</p>
                        <p>It is important not to manipulate the uterus in any way as this may precipitate incoordinate action. No further step should be taken until a strong contraction is palpable. If tension is applied to the umbilical cord without this contraction, uterine inversion may occur. This is an acute obstetric emergency with life-threatening implications for the mother (see Chapter 22), and was implicated in one maternal death in the UK in the period 2006-2008 (CMACE 2011).</p>
                        <p>Once the uterus is found to be contracted, one hand is placed above the level of the symphysis pubis with the palm facing towards the umbilicus, exerting pressure in an upwards direction. This is counter-traction. The other hand, firmly grasping the cord, applies traction in a downward and backward direction following the line of the birth canal (Fig. 18.7). Some resistance may be felt but it is important to apply steady tension by pulling the cord firmly and maintaining the pressure. Jerky movements and force should be avoided. The aim is to complete the action as one continuous, smooth, controlled movement. However, it is only possible to exert this tension for a short time as it may be an uncomfortable procedure for the mother and the midwife's hand will tire.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Downward traction on the cord must be released before uterine counter-traction is relaxed as sudden withdrawal of counter-traction while tension is still being applied to the cord may also facilitate uterine inversion. If the manoeuvre is not immediately successful there should be a pause before the uterine contraction is again checked and a further attempt is made. Should the uterus relax, tension is temporarily released until a good contraction is again palpable. Once the placenta is visible it may be cupped in the hands to ease pressure on the friable membranes. A gentle upward and downward movement or twisting action will help to coax out the membranes and increase the chances of delivering them intact. Artery forceps may be applied to gradually ease the membranes out of the vagina. This process should not be hurried; great care should be taken to avoid tearing the membranes.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Is the timing of uterotonic administration, cord clamping and/or CCT clinically important in influencing the incidence of PPH?</h4>
                        <p>Although active management leads to reduced risk of PPH, it is important to establish which of the components of this package lead(s) to this reduction. Given the difficulties of adhering to an active management policy, the absence of uterotonics in low resource countries, and the preferences of some women for physiological management, it is important to explore practice behaviours to clarify whether or not the policy, as it is currently practised, should continue.</p>
                        <p>Whether oxytocin is administered before or after the placenta is expelled does not appear to make any significant difference to the incidence of PPH (blood loss >500 ml and >1000 ml), maternal hypotension, retained placenta, length of third stage, mean blood loss, maternal haemoglobin, need for maternal blood transfusion or therapeutic uterotonics (Soltani et al 2010).</p>
                        <p>Similarly, CCT has no effect on severe haemorrhage (>1000 ml) and little, if any, effect on mild PPH (>500 ml) (Gülmezoglu et al 2012). Given the emerging evidence on the benefits of delaying cord clamping (McDonald et al 2013), it is now reasonable to suggest an active management package that includes cord clamping after 3 minutes, followed by administration of oxytocin (either before or after the birth of the placenta) and either maternal effort or controlled cord traction to expel the placenta once separation occurs. As AMTSL has not been implemented in that first 3 or more minutes, the principles of care described for expectant care during the third stage should be followed in that period.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Evidence for active versus expectant management</h3>
                        <p>There is an increasing amount of appropriate, rigorously conducted research evidence available that suggests that the prophylactic administration of a uterotonic significantly reduces the risk of PPH, results in a lower mean blood loss, fewer blood transfusions are required and there is a reduced need for therapeutic uterotonics (Begley et al 2011). It has also been highlighted by the widely ranging 'risk status' of women included in several studies that it is in fact very difficult to define a group of women who are not at risk for PPH. However, women truly at 'low risk' for PPH do not appear to suffer undue harm from EMTSL (Begley et al 2011; Dixon et al 2011), and this should remain an option for care (NICE [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence] 2007). Midwifery students should be given the opportunity to assist at births using EMTSL, to learn and develop their skills, as 'knowledge of physiological management of the third stage of labour is considered a basic midwifery competency' by the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM 2008).</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that the care pathway, whether active or expectant, is reliant on all components of the pathway being carried out as recommended. For example, if management is expectant, then the introduction of a uterotonic drug, cord clamping or pulling on the cord will disrupt the intended sequence of the care process leading to what is often described as a fragmented approach. Once the sequence of the processes is altered, the clinician should commit to completing the process. That is, if the protocol for expectant management is interrupted the clinician should proceed to completing the process with an active management approach. This practice has been shown to reduce the incidence of PPH significantly in a birth centre setting (Patterson 2005).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Asepsis</h3>
                        <p>The need for asepsis is even greater now than in the preceding stages of labour. Laceration and bruising of the cervix, vagina, perineum and vulva provide a route for the entry of microorganisms. At the placental site, a raw surface provides an ideal medium for infection. Strict attention to the prevention of infection is therefore vital.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Cord blood sampling</h3>
                        <p>This may be required for a variety of conditions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>when the mother's blood group is Rhesus negative or as a precautionary measure if the mother's Rhesus type is unknown;</li>
                            <li>when atypical maternal antibodies have been found during an antenatal screening test;</li>
                            <li>where a haemoglobinopathy is suspected (e.g. sickle cell disease);</li>
                            <li>'when there has been concern about the baby either in labour or immediately following birth' (NICE 2007:231).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The sample should be taken as soon as possible from the fetal surface of the placenta where the blood vessels are congested and easily visible. If the cord has not been clamped prior to placental birth the fetal vessels will not be congested, but a sample of sufficient volume may still be easily obtained, or can be taken by syringe prior to birth of the placenta. In the case of paired cord blood sampling being required for reasons outlined by NICE (2007), blood will be obtained from the umbilical cord. To achieve this, an additional clamp will need to be applied resulting in double-clamping of the cord. The appropriate containers should be used for any investigations requested. These may include the baby's blood group, Rhesus type, haemoglobin estimation, serum bilirubin level, cord blood analysis for acid base status, Coombs' test or electrophoresis.</p>
                        <p>Maternal blood for Kleihauer testing can be taken upon completion of the third stage.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Once the placenta has spontaneously birthed, or has been delivered, the midwife must first check that the uterus is well contracted and fresh blood loss is minimal. Careful inspection of the perineum and lower vagina is important. A strong light is directed onto the perineum in order to assess trauma accurately prior to instigating repair. This should be carried out as gently as possible as the tissues are often bruised and oedematous. If perineal suturing (see Chapter 15) is required it should be carried out as expediently as possible to prevent unnecessary blood loss, increased risk of oedema at the site of trauma and perhaps unnecessary re-infiltration of additional local anaesthetics.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Blood loss estimation</h3>
                        <p>Blood loss is difficult to measure and is frequently underestimated (Duthie et al 1990; Prastertcharoensuk et al 2000). Account must be taken of blood that has soaked into linen and swabs as well as measurable fluid loss and clot formation. The site of the blood loss does not necessarily alter the impact in terms of potential debility for affected women. Brandt (1966) believes that women can withstand perhaps a 1000-1500 ml blood loss. However, any further blood loss may not be tolerated so readily. Women who undergo elective caesarean section will for the most part have been adequately prepared. Women who undergo emergency caesarean section or vaginal birth who are dehydrated or anaemic may not withstand sudden large volumes of blood loss.</p>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> It should also be remembered that any amount of blood loss that causes a physical deterioration such as feeling faint, sudden onset of tachycardia, altered respirations or drop in blood pressure should be immediately investigated.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Examination of placenta and membranes</h3>
                        <p>This should be performed as soon after birth as practicable so that, if there is doubt about their completeness, further action may be taken before the woman leaves the birth room or the midwife leaves the home. A thorough inspection must be carried out in order to make sure that no part of the placenta or membranes has been retained. The membranes are the most difficult to examine as they become torn during the birth or delivery and may be ragged. Every attempt should be made to piece them together to give an overall picture of completeness. This is easier to see if the placenta is held by the cord, allowing the membranes to hang. The hole through which the baby was born can then usually be identified and a hand can be spread out inside the membranes to aid inspection (Fig. 18.8). The placenta should then be laid on a flat surface and both placental surfaces minutely examined in a good light. The amnion should be peeled from the chorion right up to the umbilical cord, which allows the chorion to be fully viewed.</p>
                        <p>Any clots on the maternal surface need to be removed and kept for measuring. Broken fragments of cotyledon must be carefully replaced before an accurate assessment is possible.</p>
                        <p>The lobes of a complete placenta fit neatly together without any gaps, the edges forming a uniform circle. Blood vessels should not radiate beyond the placental edge. If they do, this denotes a succenturiate lobe, which has developed separately from the main placenta (see Chapter 6). When such a lobe is visible there is no cause for concern, but if the tissue has been retained the vessels will end abruptly at a hole in the membrane. If there is any suspicion that the placenta or membranes are incomplete, they must be kept for inspection and a doctor informed immediately in case a PPH occurs or there is the possibility that a surgical intervention may be required.</p>
                        <p>Upon completion of the examination, the midwife should return her attention to the mother. The empty uterus should be firmly contracted and below the level of the umbilicus. If the fundus has risen in the abdomen a blood clot may be present. This should be expelled while the uterus is in a state of contraction by pressing the fundus gently in a downward and backward direction with due regard to the risk of inversion and acute discomfort to the woman. Force should never be used.</p>

                        <h3>Immediate care</h3>
                        <p>It is advisable for mother and baby to remain in the midwife's care for at least 1 hour after birth, regardless of the birth setting. Much of this time will be spent in clearing up and completion of records but careful observation of mother and infant is very important. If an epidural catheter is in situ it is usually removed and checked at this time. Early physiological observations including ensuring a well-contracted uterus, assessment of vaginal blood loss and a gentle inspection of the genital tract to inspect for trauma should be undertaken (NICE 2007).</p>
                        <p>The woman should be encouraged to pass urine because a full bladder may impede uterine contraction. She may not actually feel an urge to do so, especially if she has passed urine immediately prior to giving birth or an effective epidural has been in progress, but she should be asked to try. Uterine contraction and blood loss should be checked on several occasions during this first hour. Once basic procedures to ensure the woman's and baby's safety and comfort have been completed, the woman may be offered a light meal such as tea and toast.</p>
                        <p>Most women intending to breastfeed will wish to put their babies to the breast during these early moments of contact. This is especially advantageous, as babies are usually very alert at this time and their sucking reflex is particularly strong. There is also evidence to suggest that women who breastfeed soon after birth successfully breastfeed for a longer period of time (Salariya et al 1979). An additional benefit lies in the reflex release of oxytocin from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, which stimulates the uterus to contract. This may result in the mother experiencing a sudden fresh blood loss as the uterus empties and she should be pre-warned and reassured that it is a normal response. The desire to feed a newborn baby is a warm, loving and instinctive response. While breastfeeding should be actively encouraged, a formula feed should be available for those who do not wish to breastfeed.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Record-keeping</h3>
                        <p>A complete and accurate account of the labour, including the documentation of the administration of all medicines, physical examination and observations, is the midwife's responsibility. This should also include details of examination of the placenta, membranes and cord with attention drawn to any abnormalities. The volume of blood loss is particularly important. This record not only provides information that may be critical in the future care of both mother and infant but is a legal document that may be used as evidence of the care given. Signatures are therefore essential, with cosignatories where necessary. In the UK, many mothers now carry their own notes related to pregnancy and details of the birth. The completed records are a vital communication link between the midwife responsible for the birth and other caregivers, particularly those who take over care and provide ongoing community support services once the woman returns home.</p>
                        <p>It is usually the midwife who completes the birth notification form. Timely notification and referral may prevent delay in a woman receiving appropriate assistance should she need it.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Transfer from the birth room</h3>
                        <p>The midwife is responsible for seeing that all observations are made and recorded prior to transfer of mother and baby to the postnatal ward, or home, or before the midwife leaves the home following the birth.</p>
                        <p>The postnatal ward midwife should verify these details prior to transfer of mother and baby. Following a domiciliary birth, the midwife should leave details of a telephone number where she may be contacted should the parents feel any cause for concern.</p>

                        <h3>Postpartum haemorrhage</h3>
                        <p>Primary postpartum haemorrhage is defined as bleeding from the genital tract in excess of 500 ml at any time following the baby's birth up to 24 hours postpartum (WHO 2003). A loss of 500-999 ml in a healthy woman is considered a mild PPH, and severe haemorrhage is deemed to be a loss of greater than 1000 ml (Bloomfield and Gordon 1990).</p>
                        <p>Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is one of the most alarming and serious emergencies a midwife may face and can occur following both traumatic and straightforward births. It is always a stressful experience for the woman and any support persons present and may undermine her confidence, influence her attitude to future childbearing and delay her recovery. Although the maternal mortality rate (MMR) in developed countries such as those of Western Europe, Australasia, North America and Japan is quoted as approximately 7, 6, 16 and 7 per 100000 live births respectively (Hogan et al 2010), the reported MMR for lower resource countries is much higher; for example, southern Asia with 323 per 100000 live births, and sub-Saharan Africa (west) with 629 per 100000 live births (Hogan et al 2010). A significant number of the deaths recorded were due to PPH, often in the absence of a trained health professional. The midwife is often the first, and may be the only, professional person present when a haemorrhage occurs, so her prompt, competent action will be crucial in controlling blood loss and reducing the risk of maternal morbidity or even death.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Primary postpartum haemorrhage</h4>
                        <p>Fluid loss is extremely difficult to measure with any degree of accuracy, especially when a mixture of blood and fluid has soaked into the bed linen and spilled onto the floor. It should also be remembered that measurable solidified clots represent only about half the total fluid loss. With these factors in mind, the best yardstick is that any blood loss, however small, that adversely affects the mother's condition constitutes a PPH. Much will therefore depend upon the woman's general wellbeing. In addition, if the measured loss reaches 500 ml, it must be treated as a PPH, irrespective of maternal condition; however, it should be noted that in high income countries, and in a woman who is otherwise healthy with a high haemoglobin, a blood loss of 500 ml is the equivalent of a routine blood donation and usually causes no ill effects.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Causes</h5>
                        <p>There are several reasons why a PPH may occur, including atonic uterus, retained placenta, trauma and blood coagulation disorder.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Atonic uterus</h5>
                        <p>This is a failure of the myometrium at the placental site to contract and retract and to compress torn blood vessels and control blood loss by a living ligature action. When the placenta is attached, the volume of blood flow at the placental site is approximately 500-800 ml/min. Upon separation, the efficient contraction and retraction of uterine muscle will staunch the flow and prevent a haemorrhage, which can otherwise ensue with horrifying speed (Box 18.1).</p>

                        <h5>Incomplete placental separation</h5>
                        <p>If the placenta remains fully adherent to the uterine wall, it is unlikely to cause bleeding. However, once separation has begun, maternal vessels are torn. If placental tissue remains partially embedded in the spongy decidua, efficient contraction and retraction are interrupted.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Retained placenta, cotyledon, placental fragment or membranes</h5>
                        <p>These will similarly impede efficient uterine action (Sosa et al 2009).</p>
                        
                        <h5>Precipitate labour</h5>
                        <p>When the uterus has contracted vigorously and frequently, resulting in a duration of labour that is less than 1 hour, then the muscle may have insufficient opportunity to retract.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Prolonged labour</h5>
                        <p>In a labour where the active phase lasts >12 hours uterine inertia (sluggishness) may result from muscle exhaustion (Chapter 19).</p>
                        
                        <h5>Polyhydramnios, macrosomia or multiple pregnancy</h5>
                        <p>The myometrium becomes excessively stretched and therefore less efficient (Sosa et al 2009).</p>
                        
                        <h5>Placenta praevia</h5>
                        <p>The placental site is partly or wholly in the lower segment where the thinner muscle layer contains few oblique fibres: this results in poor control of bleeding.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Placental abruption</h5>
                        <p>Blood may have seeped between the muscle fibres, interfering with effective action. At its most severe this results in a Couvelaire uterus (Chapter 12).</p>
                        
                        <h5>Induction or augmentation of labour with oxytocin</h5>
                        <p>In some circumstances, the use of oxytocin during labour may result in hyperstimulation of the uterus and cause a precipitate, expulsive birth of the baby (Sosa et al 2009; Grotegut et al 2011). In this instance the uterus may still be responding in a stimulated, but ineffective manner in terms of contracting the empty uterus. In the case of induction or augmentation of labour, that continues over a prolonged period without establishing efficient uterine contractions, physical and emotional fatigue of the mother, and uterine fatigue or inertia may occur. This inertia inhibits the uterine muscle from providing strong, sustained contraction and retraction of the empty uterus that aids in the prevention of a postpartum haemorrhage.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Episiotomy, and need for perineal sutures</h5>
                        <p>Blood loss from perineal trauma, in addition to even a normal blood loss from the uterus, can together equal a mild PPH (Sosa et al 2009). Poeschmann et al (1991) have shown that an episiotomy can cause up to 30% of postpartum blood loss.</p>
                        
                        <h5>General anaesthesia</h5>
                        <p>Anaesthetic agents may cause uterine relaxation, in particular the volatile inhalational agents, for example halothane.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Mismanagement of the third stage of labour</h5>
                        <p>'Fundus fiddling' or manipulation of the uterus may precipitate arrhythmic contractions so that the placenta only partially separates and retraction is lost.</p>
                        
                        <h5>A full bladder</h5>
                        <p>If the bladder is full, its proximity to the uterus in the abdomen on completion of the second stage may interfere with uterine action. This also constitutes mismanagement.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Aetiology unknown</h5>
                        <p>A precipitating cause may never be discovered.</p>
                        <p>There are in addition a number of factors that do not directly cause a PPH, but do increase the likelihood of excessive bleeding (Box 18.2).</p>
                        
                        <h5>Previous history of PPH or retained placenta</h5>
                        <p>There may be a risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies, depending on the cause of the PPH in the previous birth. A detailed obstetric history taken at the first antenatal visit will ensure that optimum care can be given.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Fibroids (fibromyomata)</h5>
                        <p>These are normally benign tumours consisting of muscle and fibrous tissue, which may impede efficient uterine action.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Anaemia</h5>
                        <p>Women who enter labour with reduced haemoglobin concentration (below 10 g/dl) may feel a greater effect of any subsequent blood loss, however small. Moderate to severe anaemia (<9 g/dl) is associated with an increase in third stage blood loss and risk of postpartum haemorrhage (Kavle et al 2008; Soltan et al 2012).</p>
                        
                        <h5>HIV/AIDS</h5>
                        <p>Women who have HIV/AIDS are often in a state of severe immunosuppression, which lowers the platelet count to such a degree that even a relatively minor blood loss may cause severe morbidity or death.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Ketosis</h5>
                        <p>The influence of ketosis upon uterine action is still unclear. Foulkes and Dumoulin (1983) demonstrated that, in a series of 3500 women, 40% had ketonuria at some time during labour. They reported that if labour progressed well, this did not appear to jeopardize either the fetal or maternal condition. However, there was a significant relationship between ketosis and the need for oxytocin augmentation, instrumental delivery and PPH when labour lasted more than 12 hours. Correction of ketosis is therefore advisable and can be facilitated by ensuring women have an adequate intake of fluids and light solid nourishment as tolerated throughout labour. There is no evidence to suggest restriction of food or fluids is necessary during the normal course of labour (Singata et al 2010).</p>
                        
                        <h5>Caesarean section</h5>
                        <p>It should be noted that, of the five women who died of postpartum haemorrhage in the UK in the period 2006-2008, four of them had had a caesarean section (the fifth concealed her pregnancy and died alone at home) (CMACE 2011). The report noted that in three of the four women (75%), a lack of routine observation of vital signs in the postoperative period, or failure on the part of staff to notice that bleeding was occurring, were key failures in care. Postoperative observations need to be recorded regularly, using a modified early obstetric warning score (MEOWS) chart, and abnormal findings acted upon (CMACE 2011).</p>
                        
                        <h5>Signs of PPH</h5>
                        <p>Signs may be obvious, such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>visible bleeding</li>
                            <li>maternal collapse.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>However, more subtle signs may present, such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>pallor</li>
                            <li>rising pulse rate</li>
                            <li>falling blood pressure</li>
                            <li>altered level of consciousness; the mother may become restless or drowsy</li>
                            <li>an enlarged uterus as it fills with blood or blood clot; it feels 'boggy' on palpation (i.e. soft and distended and lacking tone); there may be little or no visible loss of blood.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>Prophylaxis</h5>
                        <p>By using the above list, it is possible for the midwife to apply some preventive screening in an attempt to identify women who may be at greater risk and to recognize causative factors. During the antenatal period a thorough and accurate history of previous obstetric experiences will identify possible risk factors. Arrangements for birth can be discussed with the woman, and the necessity for birth to take place in a unit where facilities for dealing with emergencies are available can be explained. The early detection and treatment of anaemia will help ensure that women enter labour with a haemoglobin level, ideally, in excess of 10 g/dl. The midwife should check that blood tests, if needed, are taken regularly and the results recorded and explained to the woman. If necessary, action can be taken to restore the haemoglobin level before birth. Women more prone to anaemia should be closely monitored, e.g. those with multiple pregnancies.</p>
                        <p>During labour, good management practices during the first and second stages are important to prevent prolonged labour and ketoacidosis. A mother should not enter the second or third stage with a full bladder. AMTSL is recommended for all women at high risk of PPH, and will reduce blood loss for women of mixed risk (Begley et al 2011). Two units of cross-matched blood should be kept available for any woman known to have a placenta praevia or other major predisposing risk factors for PPH.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Treatment of PPH</h5>
                        <p>Whatever the stage of labour or crisis that may occur, the midwife should adhere to the underlying principle of always reassuring the woman and her support persons by continually relaying appropriate information and involving them in decision-making.</p>
                        <p>Three basic principles of care should be applied immediately upon observation of excessive bleeding, using the mnemonic ABC:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Call for medical Aid.</li>
                            <li>Stop the Bleeding by rubbing up a contraction, giving a uterotonic and emptying the uterus.</li>
                            <li>ResusCitate the mother as necessary.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h6>Call for medical aid</h6>
                        <p>This is an important initial step so that help is on the way whatever transpires. If the bleeding is brought under control before the doctor arrives, then no action by the doctor will be needed. However, the woman's condition can deteriorate very rapidly, in which case medical assistance will be required urgently. If the mother is at home or in a midwife-led unit, the emergency department of the closest obstetric unit should be contacted and, depending on the policy of the region, an obstetric emergency team summoned or ambulance transfer arranged.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Stop the bleeding</h6>
                        <p>The initial action is always the same, regardless of whether bleeding occurs with the placenta in situ or later.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Rub up a contraction</h6>
                        <p>The fundus is first felt gently with the fingertips to assess its consistency. If it is soft and relaxed, the fundus is massaged with a smooth, circular motion, applying no undue pressure. When a contraction occurs, the hand is held still.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Give a uterotonic to sustain the contraction</h6>
                        <p>In many instances, oxytocin 5 units or 10 units, or combined ergometrine/oxytocin 1 ml, has already been administered and this may be repeated. Alternatively, ergometrine 0.25-0.5 mg may be injected intravenously (in the absence of contraindications), and will be effective within 45 seconds; vomiting may occur immediately. No more than two doses of ergometrine should be given (including any dose of combined ergometrine/oxytocin), as it may cause pulmonary hypertension. Several reports have described the dramatic haemostatic effects of prostaglandins used in cases of uterine atony. Misoprostol (Cytotec) or carboprost (Hemabate) are the most common prostaglandin drugs used to increase uterine contractility for the treatment of PPH. However, the side-effects (nausea, vomiting, pyrexia, hypertension, diarrhoea) associated with these drugs can make their use limited (Anderson and Etches 2007).</p>
                        <p>The baby may be put to the breast to enhance the physiological secretion of oxytocin from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, thus stimulating a contraction.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Empty the uterus</h6>
                        <p>Once the midwife is satisfied that it is well contracted, she should ensure that the uterus is emptied. If the placenta is still in the uterus, it should be delivered; if it has been expelled, any clots should be expressed by firm but gentle pressure on the fundus.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Resuscitate the mother</h6>
                        <p>An intravenous infusion should be commenced while peripheral veins are easily negotiated. This will provide a route for an oxytocin infusion or fluid replacement. As an emergency measure, the mother's legs may be lifted up in order to allow blood to drain from them into the central circulation. However, the foot of the bed should not be raised as this encourages pooling of blood in the uterus, which prevents the uterus contracting.</p>
                        <p>It is usually expedient to catheterize the bladder to ensure that a full bladder is not impeding uterine contraction and thus precipitating further bleeding, and to minimize trauma should an operative procedure be necessary.</p>
                        <p>On no account must a woman in a collapsed condition be moved prior to resuscitation and stabilization.</p>
                        <p>The flow chart in Fig. 18.9 briefly sets out the possible courses of action that may be taken depending on whether or not bleeding persists. If the above measures are successful in controlling any further loss, administration of oxytocin, 40 units in 1 litre of intravenous solution (e.g. Hartmann's or saline) infused slowly over 8-12 hours, will ensure continued uterine contraction. This will help to minimize the risk of recurrence. Before the infusion is connected, 10 ml of blood should be withdrawn for haemoglobin estimation and for cross-matching compatible blood. If bleeding continues uncontrolled, the choice of further action will depend largely upon whether the placenta remains undelivered.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Placenta delivered</h6>
                        <p>If the uterus is atonic following birth of the placenta, light fundal pressure may be used to expel residual clots while a contraction is present. If an effective contraction is not maintained, 40 units of Syntocinon in 1 litre of intravenous fluid should be started. The placenta and membranes must be re-examined for completeness because retained fragments are often responsible for uterine atony and may need to be removed manually, under anaesthetic.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Bimanual compression</h6>
                        <p>If bleeding continues, bimanual compression of the uterus may be necessary in order to apply pressure to the placental site. It is desirable for an intravenous infusion to be in progress. The fingers of one hand are inserted into the vagina like a cone; the hand is formed into a fist and placed into the anterior vaginal fornix, the elbow resting on the bed. The other hand is placed behind the uterus abdominally, the fingers pointing towards the cervix. The uterus is brought forwards and compressed between the palm of the hand positioned abdominally and the fist in the vagina (Fig. 18.10). If bleeding persists, a clotting disorder must be excluded before exploration of the vagina and uterus is performed under a general anaesthetic. Compression balloons may also be used to provide pressure on the placental site and if bleeding continues, ligation of the uterine arteries or hysterectomy may be considered.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Placenta undelivered</h6>
                        <p>The placenta may be partially or wholly adherent.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Partially adherent</h6>
                        <p>When the uterus is well contracted, an attempt should be made to deliver the placenta by applying CCT. If this is unsuccessful a doctor will be required to remove it manually.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Wholly adherent</h6>
                        <p>Bleeding does not usually occur if the placenta is completely adherent. However, the longer the placenta remains in situ the greater is the risk of partial separation, which may give rise to profuse haemorrhage.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Retained placenta</h6>
                        <p>This diagnosis is reached when the placenta remains undelivered after a specified period of time (usually 1 hour following the baby's birth). The conventional treatment is to separate the placenta from the uterine wall digitally, effecting a manual removal.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Breaking of the cord</h6>
                        <p>This is a not unusual occurrence during completion of the third stage of labour. Before further action, it is crucial to check that the uterus remains firmly contracted. If the placenta remains adherent, no further action should be taken before a doctor is notified. It is possible that manual removal may be indicated. If the placenta is palpable in the vagina, it is probable that separation has occurred and when the uterus is well contracted then maternal effort, with a fully upright posture, may be encouraged (see expectant management, above). If there is any doubt, the midwife applies fresh sterile gloves before performing a vaginal examination to ascertain whether this is so. As a last resort, if the woman is unable to push effectively then gentle fundal pressure may be used, following administration of a uterotonic drug. Great care is exercised to ensure that placental separation has already occurred and the uterus is well contracted. The woman should be relaxed as the midwife exerts downward and backward pressure on the firmly contracted fundus. This method can cause considerable pain and distress to the woman and result in the stretching and bruising of supportive uterine ligaments. If it is performed without good uterine contraction, acute inversion may ensue. This is an extremely dangerous procedure in unskilled hands and is not advocated in everyday practice when alternative, safer methods may be employed. It is very unlikely that this would be practised in the UK.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Manual removal of the placenta</h6>
                        <p>This should be carried out by a doctor. An intravenous infusion must first be sited and an effective anaesthetic in progress. The choice of anaesthesia will depend upon the woman's general condition. If an effective epidural anaesthetic is already in progress, a top-up may be given in order to avoid the hazards of general anaesthesia. A spinal anaesthetic offers an alternative but where time is an urgent factor a general anaesthetic will be initiated.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Management</h6>
                        <p>Manual removal is performed with full aseptic precautions and, unless in a dire emergency situation, should not be undertaken prior to adequate analgesia being ensured for the woman. With the left hand, the umbilical cord is held taut while the right hand is coned and inserted into the vagina and uterus following the direction of the cord. Once the placenta is located the cord is released so that the left hand may be used to support the fundus abdominally, to prevent rupture of the lower uterine segment (Fig. 18.11). The operator will feel for a separated edge of the placenta. The fingers of the right hand are extended and the border of the hand is gently eased between the placenta and the uterine wall, with the palm facing the placenta. The placenta is carefully detached with a sideways slicing movement. When it is completely separated, the left hand rubs up a contraction and expels the right hand with the placenta in its grasp. The placenta should be checked immediately for completeness, so that any further exploration of the uterus may be carried out without delay. A uterotonic drug is given upon completion.</p>
                        <p>In very exceptional circumstances, when no doctor is available to be called, a midwife would be expected to carry out a manual removal of the placenta. Once she has diagnosed a retained placenta as the cause of PPH, the midwife must act swiftly to reduce the risk of onset of shock and exsanguination. It must be remembered that the risk of inducing shock by performing a manual removal of the placenta is greater when no anaesthetic is given. In a developed country, the midwife is unlikely to find herself dealing with this situation.</p>
                        
                        <h6>At home</h6>
                        <p>If the placenta is retained following a home birth, emergency obstetric help must be summoned. Under no circumstances should a woman be transferred to hospital until an intravenous infusion is in progress and her condition stabilized. It is best if the placenta can be delivered without moving the mother but if this is not possible, or if further treatment is needed, she should be transferred to a consultant unit, with her baby.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Morbid adherence of placenta</h6>
                        <p>Very rarely, the placenta remains morbidly adherent; this is known as placenta accreta. If it is totally adherent, then bleeding is unlikely to occur and it may be left in situ to absorb during the puerperium. If, however, only part of the placenta remains embedded then the risks of fatal haemorrhage are high and an emergency hysterectomy may be unavoidable.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Trauma as a cause of PPH</h6>
                        <p>If bleeding occurs despite a well-contracted uterus, it is almost certainly the consequence of trauma to the uterus, vagina, perineum or labia, or a combination of these. As stated previously, Poeschmann et al (1991) cautioned that episiotomy may contribute up to 30% of total blood loss; in their study the severity of blood loss was linked to the length of time that elapsed between incision of the perineum and the commencement of repair. Predictably, the longer the wait the greater is the blood loss.</p>
                        <p>In order to identify the source of bleeding, the mother is placed in the lithotomy position under a good directional light. An episiotomy wound or tears to the anterior labia, clitoris and perineum often bleed freely. These external injuries are easily identified and torn vessels may be clamped with artery forceps prior to ligation. Internal trauma to the vagina, cervix or uterus more commonly occurs following instrumental or manipulative delivery. A speculum is inserted to enable the cervix and vagina to be clearly visualized and examined. Tissue or artery forceps may be used to apply pressure prior to suturing under general anaesthesia.</p>
                        <p>If bleeding persists when the uterus is well contracted and no evidence of trauma can be found, uterine rupture must be suspected. Following a laparotomy this is repaired, but if bleeding remains uncontrolled a hysterectomy may become inevitable.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Blood coagulation disorders causing PPH</h6>
                        <p>As well as the causes already listed above, PPH may be the result of coagulation failure (see Chapters 12 and 13). The failure of the blood to clot is such an obvious sign that it can be overlooked in the midst of the frantic activity that accompanies torrential bleeding. It can occur following severe pre-eclampsia, antepartum haemorrhage, massive PPH, amniotic fluid embolus, intrauterine death or sepsis. Evaluation should include coagulation status and replacing appropriate blood components (Anderson and Etches 2007). Fresh blood is usually the best treatment, as this will contain platelets and the coagulation factors V and VIII. The expert advice of a haematologist will be needed in assessing specific replacement products such as fresh frozen plasma and fibrinogen.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Maternal observation following PPH</h6>
                        <p>Once bleeding is controlled, the total volume lost must be measured and/or estimated as accurately as possible. Large amounts appear less than they are in reality. A MEOWS chart should be maintained postpartum and abnormal scores should be reported and prompt action taken (CMACE 2011). Maternal pulse and blood pressure are recorded every 15 minutes and the temperature taken every 4 hours. The uterus should be palpated frequently to ensure that it remains well contracted and lochia lost must be observed. Intravenous fluid replacement should be carefully calculated to avoid circulatory overload. Monitoring the central venous pressure (see Chapter 22) will provide an accurate assessment of the volume required, especially if blood loss has been severe. Fluid intake and urinary output are recorded as indicators of renal function. The output should be accurately measured on an hourly basis by the use of a self-retaining urinary catheter.</p>
                        <p>The woman may need high dependency care if closer monitoring is required, until her condition is stable. All records should be meticulously completed and signed contemporaneously. Continued vigilance will be important for 24-48 hours. As this woman will need a period of recovery, she will not be suitable for early transfer home.</p>

                        <h4>Secondary postpartum haemorrhage</h4>
                        <p>Secondary postpartum haemorrhage is any abnormal or excessive bleeding from the genital tract occurring between 24 hours and 12 weeks postnatally. In developed countries, 2% of postnatal women are admitted to hospital with this condition, half of them undergoing uterine surgical evacuation (Alexander et al 2007). It is most likely to occur between 10 and 14 days after birth. Bleeding is usually due to retention of a fragment of the placenta or membranes, or the presence of a large uterine blood clot. Typically occurring during the second week, the lochia is heavier than normal and will have changed from a serous pink or brownish loss to a bright red blood loss. The lochia may also be offensive if infection is a contributory factor. Subinvolution, pyrexia and tachycardia are usually present. As this is an event that is most likely to occur at home, women should be alerted to the possible signs of secondary PPH prior to discharge from midwifery care.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Management</h5>
                        <p>The following steps should be taken:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>call a doctor</li>
                            <li>reassure the woman and her support person(s)</li>
                            <li>rub up a contraction by massaging the uterus if it is still palpable</li>
                            <li>express any clots</li>
                            <li>encourage the mother to empty her bladder</li>
                            <li>give a uterotonic drug either by the intravenous or intramuscular route</li>
                            <li>keep all pads and linen to assess the volume of blood lost</li>
                            <li>if bleeding persists, discuss a range of treatment options with the woman and, if appropriate, prepare her for theatre.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the bleeding occurs at home and the woman has telephoned the hospital, midwife or her GP, she should be told to lie down flat until professional assistance arrives (the front door should be left unlocked if the woman is alone). On arrival, the doctor, midwife or paramedic will assess the amount of blood loss and the woman's condition and attempt to arrest the haemorrhage. If the loss is severe or uncontrolled, the nearest emergency obstetric unit will be called and the mother and baby prepared for transfer to hospital. The doctor, midwife or paramedic who attends will start an intravenous infusion and ensure that the mother's condition is stable first.</p>
                        <p>Careful assessment is usually undertaken prior to the uterus being explored under general anaesthetic. The use of ultrasound as a diagnostic tool is invaluable in minimizing the number of mothers who have operative intervention. If retained products of conception cannot be seen on a scan, the mother may be treated conservatively with antibiotic therapy and oral ergometrine. The haemoglobin should be estimated prior to discharge. If it is below 9 g/dl, options for iron replacement should be discussed with the woman. The severity of the anaemia will assist in determining the most appropriate care, which may be dependent on whether or not the woman is symptomatic (e.g. feeling faint, dizzy, short of breath). Management may vary from increased intake of iron-rich foods, iron supplements or, in extreme cases, blood transfusion. It is also important to discuss the common symptoms that may be experienced as a result of anaemia following PPH, including extreme tiredness and general malaise. Encourage the woman to seek assistance and stress the importance of making an appointment to see her GP to have her general health and haemoglobin levels checked.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Haematoma formation</h4>
                        <p>PPH may also be concealed as the result of progressive haematoma formation. This may be obvious at such sites as the perineum or lower vagina, but it is more difficult to diagnose if it occurs into the broad ligament or vault of the vagina. A large volume of blood may collect insidiously (up to 1 litre). Involution and lochia are usually normal, the main symptom being increasingly severe maternal pain. This is often so acute that the haematoma has to be drained in theatre under a general anaesthetic. Secondary infection is a strong possibility.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Care after a postpartum haemorrhage</h4>
                        <p>Whatever the cause of the haemorrhage, the woman will need the continued support of her midwife until she regains her confidence. Her partner may also be fearful of a recurrence and need much reassurance. If the mother is breastfeeding, lactation may be impaired but this will only be temporary and she should be reassured that persevering will result in a return to normal lactation.</p>
