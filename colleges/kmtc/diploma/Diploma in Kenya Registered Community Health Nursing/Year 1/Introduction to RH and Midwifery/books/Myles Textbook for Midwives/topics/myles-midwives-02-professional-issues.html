                        <p>This chapter affords the student with the frameworks governing the midwifery profession and underpinning the professional practice of the midwife. It emphasizes how the statutory supervision of midwives framework is a vital element of leadership and clinical governance supporting risk management by monitoring the development of maternity services and standards of midwifery practice. Having knowledge of these various frameworks is essential to every midwife so they are able to function effectively as autonomous, accountable practitioners and provide care to all childbearing women and their families that follows legal and ethical principles and is also contemporary, safe and of a high quality.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Statutory regulation provides structure and boundaries that can be understood and interpreted by both professionals and the public: it is the basis of a contract of trust between the public and the profession. Although the primary purpose of regulation is protection and safety of the public, the same mechanism also protects and supports midwives in their practice.</p>
                        <p>Regulation of midwifery should play a key part in helping to improve women’s experiences of the maternity services and preventing harm from occurring in midwifery practice. It is essential that women and their families can be assured they are being cared for by competent and skilled midwives who are effectively educated and knowledgeable in contemporary midwifery practice. Consequently, midwifery regulation should not be viewed as an abstract concept but from how it is perceived in ordinary everyday healthcare terms, that is: supporting the standard of care that women want or what midwives would want for themselves and their families.</p>
                        <p>Midwife is a title protected in statute in the United Kingdom (UK). This means that no one can call themselves a midwife or practise as a midwife unless they are registered on the Nursing and Midwifery Council’s (NMC) Register. This registration must be active, in that the midwife has met the continuing professional development and practice requirements to remain on the Register and has paid the renewal of registration fee (every three years supported by a signed notification of practice form [NOP]) or a retainer fee (every interim first and second year of active registration). There are over 35000 midwives on the NMC Midwives Register (NMC 2013).</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">SELF-REGULATION</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In the UK, midwives are members of a self-regulating profession. This is a privilege in that the standards for education and practice of any midwife are set by midwives themselves. Self-regulating professions have regulatory bodies that are funded by their own professionals. In the case of midwives and nurses, their initial and subsequent retaining/renewal of registration payments is the sole funding that pays for all the functions of their regulatory body, the NMC.</p>
                        <p>Self-regulation of midwives is achieved through a statutory Midwifery Committee of the NMC which advises the Nursing and Midwifery Council (The Council) about what is required to ensure safe and competent midwives. The powers of the Midwifery Committee are defined under Section 41 of The Nursing and Midwifery Order (2001). The term statutory means that the role and scope of the committee is enshrined in law and cannot be reduced or disbanded unless there is a change in the legislation to allow it to happen. Any rule or standards for midwifery education or practice set by the Midwifery Committee are subsequently approved by the Council before they can come into effect.</p>
                        <p>Self-regulation of midwifery, however, does not exist in all countries and consequently regulations for midwifery education or practice are set by the national government or by another professional group who may be perceived as senior/superior. However, it is acknowledged that the midwifery profession, as other health professions in the UK, is affected to varying degrees by national regulations that are set by others who are not part of the profession: for example, legislation for safeguarding vulnerable children or adults (Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006; Department of Health [DH] 2011; HM Government 2013); medicines legislation (Human Medicines Regulations 2012); health and safety in the workplace regulations (Health and Safety at Work Act 1974). All midwives are bound by these national laws in the same way as others.</p>
                        <p>Protection of the public cannot be achieved by the regulatory body alone and thus it involves a combination of statutory regulation, personal self-regulation, employment practices, professional organizations, education and working in an effective and collaborative way with others. It can, however, be difficult for individuals to act ethically and escalate concerns about practices within their organizations. It is here where the regulator and regulation can support the midwife by offering appropriate guidance. The NMC can also work actively with other service regulators such as the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England, Healthcare Improvement Scotland, the Regulator and Quality Improvement Authority in Northern Ireland and Healthcare Inspectorate Wales, to ensure early action is taken to prevent unnecessary harm to women and their families.</p>
                        <p>Overseeing the NMC and other healthcare regulators and working with them to improve the way the professions are regulated is the Professional Standards Authority (PSA), which was previously known as the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence (CHRE). This organization is accountable to Parliament for the health, safety and wellbeing of patients and other members of the public. The PSA is also required to undertake research, develop policy and provide advice to the four governments of the UK on regulating healthcare professionals and consequently provides an annual review of each of the healthcare regulators.</p>
                        <p>There has been, and still remains, a degree of public concern in the UK about self-regulation of the healthcare professions as a result of some high profile media cases where patient care was severely compromised (Bristol Royal Infirmary Inquiry 2001; Clothier et al 1994; HM Government 2007; Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust Public Inquiry 2013). Consequently, a number of reviews of professional regulation have been undertaken to improve safety and quality of care, the maintenance of professional standards and public assurance that poor practice or bad behaviour will be identified and promptly dealt with (DH 2007; CHRE 2008). The outcome of these reports and the introduction of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 have led to a major reorganization of the structure and function of the NMC.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Whilst it is appreciated that the establishment of legislation governing the practice of midwifery had been taken by the governments in Austria, Norway and Sweden as early as 1801, it was not until a century later, in 1902, that the first Midwives Act sanctioned the establishment of a statutory body - the Central Midwives Board (CMB) in England and Wales, followed by the Midwives (Scotland) Act 1915 and the Midwives (Ireland) Act 1918. The first Act in 1902 was promoted by individual members of Parliament through Private Members' Bills in the House of Lords and by others who supported midwife registration rather than being initiated by the government of the time. All three Acts of the UK prescribed the constitution and function of the CMBs in each of the four countries and laid down their statutory powers that included the development of systems for licensing midwives and prohibiting unqualified practice. The CMB had the responsibility for regulating the issue of certificates, keeping a central roll of midwives and providing a means for the suspension of practitioners through Local Supervising Authorities (LSA) and the supervision of midwives. It also had the responsibility for regulating any courses of training and examinations and generally supervising the effective running of the profession. A series of further Acts of Parliament in 1926, 1934, 1936 and 1950 amended this initial legislation and were consolidated in the Midwives Act 1951 and Midwives (Scotland) Act 1951. However all midwifery statutory bodies of the UK were dominated by doctors who also held the chairmanships and there was no requirement for even one midwife to be included on the Council of any CMB. This remained the case until the dissolution of the CMBs in 1983.</p>
                        <p>The Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1979 established the framework of the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC) and the National Boards for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales to regulate education and practice, leading to the abolition of the CMBs in 1983. This was the first time that midwives had been amalgamated in law with other professional groups as up to this point midwifery had remained independent of any nursing infrastructure with the regulation of the nursing profession being undertaken by the General Nursing Councils (GNC). However, a separate Midwifery Committee was set up in Statute after much campaigning by the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) and the Association of Radical Midwives (ARM) who feared that the voice of midwifery would be over-ruled by that of nursing. Nevertheless, in 1987, the profession-specific education officers were replaced by generic education officers, over-ruling the Midwifery Committee and protests from members of the midwifery profession at the time.</p>
                        <p>A decade later, an external review of the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1979 was commissioned by the DH which resulted in a smaller, directly elected central council with smaller national boards. Regional Health Authorities (RHA) were assigned the responsibility of funding nursing and midwifery education, whilst the national boards retained responsibility for course validation and accreditation. This in essence established the purchaser-provider model, where hospitals were expected to contract with education providers for a requisite number of training places for nurses and midwives to fulfil their local workforce planning. These arrangements and the new streamlined structure of the UKCC and national boards were incorporated into the 1992 Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act. Further consolidation of the 1979 and 1992 Acts incorporating all the reforms, resulted in the 1997 Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act.</p>
                        <p>During the 1990s, the government devolved power away from the UK Parliament based in Westminster to the other three countries of the UK to enable them to establish their own parliaments or assemblies. This devolution has not impacted greatly on the regulation of midwives as midwifery is one of the established professions of which the power to regulate remains with the UK Parliament at Westminster, advised by the Department of Health England. Only new health-related professions that are established in the future will be exempt from this approach.</p>
                        <p>Further reform of the health professions was included in the Health Act 1999 that repealed the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1997. This resulted in replacing primary legislation with a Statutory Instrument by Order, which meant a departure from the normal practice of parliamentary procedure experienced during the previous century, involving professional scrutiny through all the earlier stages, including the publication of Green and White Papers. Section 62 (9) of the Health Act 1999 set out the Order for the establishment of the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) which commenced operating in 2002. The NMC took over the quality assurance functions of the UKCC and the four national boards, although some of the functions of the national boards in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are provided by NHS Education Scotland, the Northern Ireland Practice and Education Council for Nursing and Midwifery, and Healthcare Inspectorate Wales. This development reunited standards for education with standards for practice and supervision of midwives on a UK basis. However, the creation of this UK-wide regulatory body, the NMC, was contrary to the trend of devolution.</p>

                        <p>This is the main legislation that established the NMC and was made under Section 60 of the Health Act 1999: it is generally known as The Order. The Order sets out what the Council is required to do (shall) and provides permissive powers for things that it can choose to do (may). The numbered paragraphs within The Order are referred to as Articles.</p>
                        <p>The structure of registration was set up according to Part III of The Order, resulting in three parts of the Register being opened from August 2004:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nurses</li>
                            <li>Midwives</li>
                            <li>Specialist Community Public Health Nurses: namely health visitors, school nurses, occupational health nurses, health promotion nurses and sexual health nurses.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Part IV set up Education and Training; Part V set up Fitness to Practise; Part VIII relates to Midwifery.</p>
                        <p>Midwifery-specific Articles established the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Article 41: The Midwifery Committee</li>
                            <li>Article 42: Rules specific to midwifery practice</li>
                            <li>Article 43: Regulation of the LSA and supervisors of midwives</li>
                            <li>Article 45: Regulation of attendance in childbirth.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Order has been subject to a number of amendments, which are detailed in Box 2.1.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Being the UK-wide regulator for two professions, namely nursing and midwifery, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) has two key functions: setting the strategic direction for the NMC and overseeing the work of senior NMC staff. The Council ensures that the NMC complies with all relevant legislation governing nursing and midwifery practice, including the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001 (The Order) and adheres to the Charities Act 1993. Having charitable status, the NMC should use all funds received from its registrants purely for the benefit of the public, i.e. in the regulation of nursing and midwifery to safeguard the public’s health and wellbeing.</p>
                        <h3>Functions of the NMC</h3>
                        <p>The powers of the NMC are specified within The Order and, as was the case with the CMB and UKCC, its primary function is to establish and improve standards of midwifery and nursing care in order to safeguard the public by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Establishing and maintaining a Register of all qualified nurses, midwives and specialist community public health nurses</li>
                            <li>Setting standards for the education and practice of all nurses, midwives and specialist community public health nurses to ensure they have the right skills and qualities at the point of registration which continue to develop throughout their professional careers</li>
                            <li>Regulating fitness to practise, conduct and performance through rules, codes and statutory supervision of midwives.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Where a registrant does not meet the standards for skills, education and behaviour, the NMC has the power to remove them from the Register permanently or for a set period of time.</p>
                        <h3>Membership</h3>
                        <p>The NMC comprises of 12 lay and registrant members, including one member from each of the four UK countries who are appointed by the Privy Council. Each registrant member is from either a nursing or midwifery background with the lay members selected for their expertise in various areas and strategic experience. These members also sit on various Committees within the framework of the NMC.</p>
                        <h3>Committees</h3>
                        <p>Following the NMC Governance review (NMC 2013), a number of the Council Committees were disbanded: the Appointments Board, the Education Committee, the Finance and Information Technology Committee and the Fitness to Practise Committee. As a result only three main Council Committees remain: the Audit Committee, the Midwifery Committee and the Remuneration Committee. There are, however, three further statutory committees: the Investigating Committee, the Conduct and Competence Committee and the Health Committee, known collectively as the Practice Committees, which are responsible for considering allegations under Part 5 of the Order.</p>
                        <h4>The Audit Committee</h4>
                        <p>This committee is responsible for ensuring that Council business is conducted with the highest integrity, probity and efficiency in addition to guaranteeing that there are appropriate systems in place for managing risk.</p>
                        <h4>The Midwifery Committee</h4>
                        <p>The role of the Midwifery Committee is to advise Council on any matter affecting midwifery, such as policy issues and standards influencing midwifery practice, education and statutory supervision of midwives, responding to policy trends, research and ethical issues concerning all registrants. The Midwifery Committee recommendations and subsequent Council decisions influence midwifery developments in the UK affecting the lives of individual women and their families for whom the midwife provides care.</p>
                        <h4>The Remuneration Committee</h4>
                        <p>The responsibility of this Committee is to determine and agree with Council the framework for the remuneration of the NMC’s Chief Executive and Registrar, directors and other such members of the executive team as it is designated to consider.</p>
                        <h4>Practice Committees</h4>
                        <p>Any allegations of impaired Fitness to Practise referred to the NMC are considered by Panels of the Investigating Committee, with a possible referral to the Conduct and Competence Committee or the Health Committee, depending on the outcome of the Panel’s decision. In 2014 a system of professional case examiners is to be introduced to make decisions at the investigation stage of the process as to whether cases should proceed to a final public hearing stage. The NMC expects this will improve the consistency of decisions and develop a faster and more costeffective process. Furthermore, the introduction of a new power to review decisions to close cases at the investigation stage is also being considered. The final stage of a Fitness to Practise case, however, will still be heard by an independent panel, comprising of at least one nurse or midwife and at least one lay member advised by a legal expert.</p>
                        <h5>The Investigating Committee</h5>
                        <p>The responsibility of the panels of the Investigating Committee is to consider any allegations of a registrant being unfit to practise. If the registrant’s health is in question, it is usual for a medical practitioner to be present. These hearings take place in private and the Panel decides if there is a case to answer. If there is, then a referral is made to either the Conduct and Competence Committee or the Health Committee. However, if the registrant is thought to be an immediate risk to the public, the Panel may refer the case immediately to an Interim Orders hearing. The Panel can then impose the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An interim suspension order: registration is suspended to prevent the registrant from working during investigation of the case. This can be imposed for up to 18 months, but must be reviewed after 6 months and every 3 months thereafter.</li>
                            <li>An interim conditions of practice order: the panel imposes conditions on the registrant for up to 18 months. According to the situation, this order can be revoked, modified or replaced with a different order.</li>
                            <li>Removal from the Register: can be authorized by the Investigating Committee should there be fraudulent or incorrect entries in the register (NMC 2012a).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>The Conduct and Competence Committee</h5>
                        <p>This committee considers cases where a registrant’s fitness to practise is alleged to be impaired due to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>misconduct</li>
                            <li>lack of competence</li>
                            <li>a criminal offence</li>
                            <li>a finding by any other health or social care regulator or licensing body that fitness to practise is impaired, or</li>
                            <li>a barring under the arrangements provided by the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 (Controlled Activity and Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 2010, the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (Northern Ireland) Order 2007 or the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Panel hearings are held in public, reflecting the NMC’s public accountability, although the Panel may agree to hold parts of the case in private, to protect the anonymity of the alleged victim, or if disclosure of confidential medical evidence is involved.</p>
                        <h5>The Health Committee</h5>
                        <p>This committee decides whether a registrant’s fitness to practise is impaired by physical or mental ill health and, if so, determines the appropriate sanction required to protect the public. Because of the confidential nature of the medical evidence considered, Panel hearings are held in private.</p>
                        <h3>Decisions made by the Practice Committees</h3>
                        <p>Hearings follow a four stage process:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>establishing whether the facts are proved</li>
                            <li>establishing whether the person’s fitness to practise is impaired</li>
                            <li>receiving information about the person’s previous professional and employment history and in mitigation, and</li>
                            <li>deciding the sanction.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Since 2008, Panels have used the Civil Standard of Proof to decide whether the facts of an allegation are proved (Health and Social Care Act 2007, 2008). Evidence is therefore based on the balance of probabilities, rather than the Criminal Standard of Proof where facts previously needed to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. When deciding on impairment, panels look for the level of conduct and competence expected of the average registrant, not for the highest possible level of practice. Even if there has been a breach of a standard set out in The Code (NMC 2008), it does not automatically follow that a registrant’s fitness to practise is impaired. That is a judgement for the Panel to make.</p>
                        <p>A range of sanctions is available and the Panel uses the Council’s indicative sanctions guidance to determine the one that is most appropriate for the particular case. The Panel must first consider whether, taking account of all the circumstances of the case, it is appropriate to take no further action. If the Panel decides this option is not appropriate, the following sanctions are available:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>to issue a caution order for a specified period of between one and five years</li>
                            <li>to impose a conditions of practice order for a specified period up to three years</li>
                            <li>to impose a suspension order for up to one year</li>
                            <li>to impose a striking off order of the nurse or midwife from the Register (in lack of competence cases, this option is available only if the registrant has been continuously suspended or under conditions of practice for the previous two years).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Consensual panel determination</h3>
                        <p>From 2013, the NMC have introduced consensual panel determination, which enables a registrant who is subject to a fitness to practise allegation to agree a provisional sanction with the NMC before it is put before a panel for consideration. This option is offered to a registrant following a full investigation and who has readily admitted all the charges against them in that their fitness to practise is impaired and a sanction is then provisionally agreed. The agreement is then put before a Conduct and Competence Committee or Health Committee Panel who will decide to accept or reject it. If rejected, the case is put before a new panel to conduct a full hearing and decide an appropriate outcome. This new arrangement reduces the need for witnesses to attend hearings, the length of hearings and enables the NMC to concentrate their resources on cases where there are significant matters in dispute.</p>
                        <h3>Voluntary removal from the Register</h3>
                        <p>Voluntary removal allows a registrant who admits that their fitness to practise is impaired, and who does not intend to continue practising, to apply to be permanently removed from the NMC Register without a full public hearing. This development was introduced in January 2013 to enable the NMC to take swift action in protecting the public following its investigation and liberating resources that can be used in more significant cases.</p>
                        <p>Voluntary removal is allowed in only limited circumstances where there is no public interest in holding a full hearing and where the public is best protected by a nurse or midwife’s immediate removal from the Register. Such registrants would be those who accept that they are no longer fit to practise due to a serious or long-term health condition or are near retirement age. Voluntary removal will not be allowed where the allegations are so serious that public confidence in professional standards would suffer if they were not dealt with at a public hearing. This includes cases where the actions of a registrant have caused the death of a patient or other significant harm, including sexual misconduct.</p>
                        <p>While an application for voluntary removal can be made at any time, it is not allowed until a full investigation into the allegation has been completed. Where possible, the Registrar should consider the views of the person who made the initial allegation before making a decision. If an application is allowed, the registrant will appear on the NMC website with the status ‘Voluntarily removed’ adjacent to their name. The admissions made by the registrant may be made available to relevant enquirers, including potential employers, other regulators and overseas medical authorities.</p>
                        <h3>Restoration to the Register following a striking off order</h3>
                        <p>A registrant’s name is removed from the NMC Register for five years during which time they are not allowed to work as a nurse or midwife in the UK. The application process to be restored to the Register can be made five years after the striking off order was made, as this is not done automatically. The process is as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The nurse or midwife must make an application to the NMC Registrar for the process to begin.</li>
                            <li>A NMC committee will then decide at a hearing whether or not to allow the former nurse or midwife to be readmitted to the Register.</li>
                            <li>They will take into consideration the initial charge, the nurse or midwife’s understanding and insight into their past behaviour, and any action they may have taken with regard to the reasons for which they were struck off.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the registrant can demonstrate they have achieved the additional education, training and experience required and once the registration fee has been paid, their name can be restored to the Register. However, if the application is unsuccessful, an appeal may be made within 28 days of the decision date. The individual may be suspended indefinitely should subsequent applications be made while the striking off order is in place and they are also unsuccessful.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Responsibility and accountability</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Although midwives practise in a wide range of settings, they are all unified by underlying values and responsibilities. Each midwife has a personal responsibility for their own practice by being aware of their personal strengths and limitations and is therefore required to continually develop their knowledge and skills to maintain competence. Self-regulation and professional freedom are based on the assumption that each professional can be trusted to work without supervision and, where necessary, take action against colleagues should their practice not be up to the appropriate standards. Furthermore midwives share a collective responsibility in how women and their families are treated and cared for. This means that each midwife should highlight instances where individual practices or where the systems or processes within organizations providing maternity services, are compromising safe and appropriate care to women and their babies.</p>
                        <p>Accountability is more than having responsibility, although the concepts are used interchangeably and means that midwives are answerable for their actions and omissions, regardless of advice or directions by another professional. To be accountable, a midwife is required to have the ability, responsibility and authority for their actions (Bergman 1981). Each registrant is professionally accountable for their actions and omissions to the NMC, legally accountable to the law and contractually accountable to their employer. They must always act in the best interests of the individuals to whom they are providing care. In the case of midwives this would be the childbearing woman, her baby and family. There may be occasions when midwives have difficulty appreciating their own accountability, especially when carrying out the instructions of medical staff, but it is clear from The Code (NMC 2008) that registrants’ accountability cannot be delegated to or borne by others. Midwives can gain greater clarity and understanding of their accountability through discussions with their supervisor of midwives.</p>
                        <p>Different levels of individual and corporate accountability exist in relation to professional practice and management structures. Duty of care and the advice contained in The Code (NMC 2008) provide further clarity around a registrant’s professional accountability.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Contemporary midwifery practice is characterized by increasing complexities in respect of the health needs of childbearing women, their babies and families as well as increasing uncertainties about what is right and wrong. Midwives can find themselves faced with dilemmas and have to make decisions where there may not be evidence of any robust clinical evidence. It is therefore important each midwife is fully aware of the legislation and legal framework in which they should practise as accountable practitioners within the context of normal midwifery for which they have been duly trained and have the appropriate expertise.</p>
                        <h3>Legislation</h3>
                        <p>The Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001 (SI 2002 No: 253) is the statutory legislation that currently governs the midwifery profession and endorsed the formation of the regulatory body, the NMC.</p>
                        <p>Primary legislation is enshrined in Acts of Parliament, which have been debated in the House of Commons and House of Lords before receiving Royal Assent. Such legislation is expected to last at least a couple of decades before being revised. With the pressure on Parliamentary time, Acts of Parliament are frequently designed as enabling legislation in that they provide a framework from which statutory rules may be derived: known as secondary or subordinate legislation. All secondary legislation is published in Statutory Instruments.</p>
                        <p>Statutory rules/secondary legislation can in theory be implemented or amended much more quickly as it is the Privy Council which lays the rules before the House of Commons for formal and generally automatic approval rather than is the case for primary legislation that requires endorsement by the Secretary of State. However, this may still take several weeks or months to occur.</p>
                        <h3>The Human Rights Act 1998</h3>
                        <p>The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1951) set out to protect basic human rights and the UK was the first signatory to the Convention. The Convention is enforced through the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The Human Rights Act was passed in 1998 and came into force on 2 October 2000, since when most of the articles of the convention have been directly enforceable in the UK courts in relation to public authorities and organizations, such as the National Health Service (NHS). It is important that midwives are aware of, and encouraged to work within, the boundaries of this Act. Of particular importance to midwives and those working in health care are the following Articles of the Act:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Article 2: The right to life (e.g. continuing treatment of the life of a severely disabled baby).</li>
                            <li>Article 3: The right not to be tortured or subjected to inhumane or degrading treatment (e.g. chaining a pregnant prisoner to a bed during labour would contravene this Article).</li>
                            <li>Article 5: The right to liberty and security (e.g. safe and competent care during childbirth).</li>
                            <li>Article 6: The right to a fair trial (e.g. civil hearings and tribunals as well as criminal proceedings).</li>
                            <li>Article 8: The right to respect privacy and family life (e.g. supports a woman’s right to give birth at home).</li>
                            <li>Article 12: The right to marry (e.g. found a family, including fertility and assisted fertility).</li>
                            <li>Article 14: The right not to be discriminated against (e.g. women with a disability, from a different ethnic/cultural background).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>One benefit of this Act is that it has placed the public at the centre of health care. The individual’s experience has become an important measure of quality and effectiveness in health care and as a consequence of this Act the NHS complaints system has been reviewed. Midwives should be aware that when someone has a right to something, there is usually a corresponding duty on someone else to facilitate the right (Beauchamp and Childress 2012). It could be said that women have a right to safe and competent care during childbirth, fitting in with Article 5. It would therefore follow that as midwives are educated to provide midwifery care, they have an obligation that the care is both safe and competent. Similarly, the UK Government via the NMC has an obligation in regulating its practitioners to ensure they practise safely and competently. The NMC does this by setting the Midwives Rules and Standards (NMC 2012b), via the Post Registration Education and Practice (PREP) Standards (NMC 2011) and the statutory supervision of midwives framework.</p>
                        <h3>Legal frameworks: rules and standards</h3>
                        <p>Each midwife must meet Standard 17 of the Standards for Pre-registration Midwifery Education (NMC 2009a), which stipulate the competencies and Essential Skills Clusters (ESCs) required of all midwives and which also comply with Article 42 of the European Union Directive on professional qualifications (2005/36/EC). In addition, the role and sphere of a midwife’s practice are clearly defined in the Midwives Rules and Standards (NMC 2012b), the latter of which supplement the standards set out in The Code (NMC 2008) and thus provides the midwife with the legal frameworks in which to practise. Furthermore, the midwife’s role is also embodied in the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) Definition of the Midwife (ICM 2011) (see Chapter 1).</p>
                        <h4>Midwives Rules and Standards</h4>
                        <p>The Midwives Rules and Standards (NMC 2012b) are specific to the midwifery profession and relate to midwifery practice and the supervision of midwives. They are developed through the Midwifery Committee and approved by the Council. The current Midwives Rules and Standards are organized into five parts: preliminaries, requirements for practice, obligations and scope of practice, supervision and reporting and action by the local supervising authority. They provide detail about the specific rule, the LSA standard and the midwifery standard. Details of the rules contained within these parts can be seen in Box 2.2. Midwives need to be mindful that as the Midwives Rules are established by legislation set out in The Order, they are a legal requirement for midwifery registration and practice, whereas the Standards provide each midwife with guidance as to how each rule can be met in practice.</p>

                            </ul>
                        </aside>

                        <h5>Rule 5: Scope of practice</h5>
                        <p>Rule 5 (NMC 2012b) clarifies the midwife’s responsibility in that she should refer to other appropriately qualified health or social care professionals whenever any emergency or deviation from the norm occurs in a woman or baby which is outside of her current scope of practice. It is imperative that a midwife is fully aware that Rule 5 also states that a midwife should not permit anyone else or arrange for anyone else to act as their substitute other than another practising midwife or a registered medical practitioner. Permitting maternity support workers (MSW) to undertake activities associated with the role of the midwife would therefore be contravening Rule 5 and the midwife would be fully accountable for the consequences of the actions or omissions of the MSW. Similarly, the midwife remains professionally accountable for what a student midwife does or fails to do in clinical practice, but the subtle difference is that this delegation is permitted as the student is training to become a midwife and thus will be developing the underpinning knowledge and skills expected of a practising midwife.</p>
                        <h5>Rule 6: Records</h5>
                        <p>Rule 6 (NMC 2012b) outlines the midwife’s responsibilities in respect of the safe storage of records relating to the advice and care provided to women and babies following their discharge from that care, including situations where the midwife is self-employed and when a midwife ceases to be registered with the NMC. The LSA standard relates to guidance concerning transfer of midwifery records from self-employed midwives. The midwife standards specify that all records relating to the care of a woman and baby should be kept securely for 25 years, including work diaries. Self-employed midwives should also ensure that women are able to access their records and inform them of the location of the records if they are transferred to the LSA. Claims can arise up to 25-30 years after a baby’s birth and, if the documentation is lost, it is difficult for the case to be successfully defended. The guidance for storage and access to records is in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 that covers both computerised and manually held records.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the NMC guidance on record keeping (NMC 2009b) provides the principles that support good record keeping that should be integral to the practice of every registrant and includes details relating to confidentiality, access to records and information disclosure. It also stresses the importance of registrants keeping up to date with relevant legislation, case law and national and local policies relating to information and record keeping as well as undertaking audits to assess the quality and standard of the record keeping and communications.</p>
                        <h4>The Code: Standards of Conduct, Performance and Ethics for Nurses and Midwives</h4>
                        <p>The Code (NMC 2008) provides the registrant with the foundation of good nursing and midwifery practice and is a vital mechanism in safeguarding the health and wellbeing of the public. It highlights four standards that each registrant must clearly demonstrate through their professional practice in order to meet public trust. These are identified in Box 2.3.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 2.3 NMC Code: Public trust</h4>
                            <p>The people in your care must be able to trust you with their health and wellbeing. To justify that trust you must:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Make the care of people your first concern, treating them as individuals and respecting their dignity</li>
                                <li>Work with others to protect and promote the health and wellbeing of those in your care, their families and carers, and the wider community</li>
                                <li>Provide a high standard of practice and care at all times</li>
                                <li>Be open and honest, act with integrity and uphold the reputation of your profession</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><small>Source: The Code: standards of conduct, performance and ethics for nurses and midwives (NMC 2008)</small></p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>These four standards are further expanded upon in The Code and include gaining consent, adhering to professional boundaries, working effectively as part of a team and delegation appropriately to others, keeping knowledge and skills up to date, maintaining clear and accurate records and upholding the reputation of the profession at all times. The Code reaffirms the registrant’s personal accountability for their actions and omissions and being able to justify their decisions. Furthermore, the registrant’s actions should always be lawful whether these relate to their professional or personal life. A registrant who does not practise according to these standards could find themselves before the NMC’s Practice Committees with a possible suspension from practice and/or removal from the professional Register.</p>
                        <p>The increase in social networking has necessitated further guidance from the NMC (2012c) in that conduct online should be judged in the same way as conduct in the real world. The consequences of improper action or behaviour when posting information on such sites could put a nurse’s or midwife’s registration at risk or could jeopardize a student from being eligible to join the professional Register.</p>
                        <h4>The Post Registration Education and Practice (PREP) Standards</h4>
                        <p>In order for all registrants to retain their name on the professional Register, they have to fulfil the requirements of the Post Registration Education and Practice Standards (NMC 2011), which are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>undertake a minimum of 450 hours in clinical practice during the previous three years (practice standard)</li>
                            <li>undertake a minimum of 35 hours study relevant to their practice every three years (continuing professional development standard)</li>
                            <li>maintain a professional portfolio of their learning activity</li>
                            <li>complete a notification of practice (NOP) form every three years</li>
                            <li>undertake a return to practice programme if they have been out of practice for three years or more.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>From a legal perspective it is every midwife’s responsibility to ensure they remain professionally up to date with developments in practice, are clinically competent to fulfil their role and their practice is evidence-based. It is no defence for the midwife to disregard developments in practice and continue to use out-of-date policies, protocols and guidelines. All employers are required to provide regular education and training programmes either within the workplace or alternative educational institutions to support midwives in meeting their professional development needs. The supervisor of midwives can also support midwives in this respect through the annual supervisory meetings with each supervisee.</p>
                        <h4>Standards for Medicines Management</h4>
                        <p>Medicines management and prescribing in the UK are governed by a complex framework of legislation, policy and standards of which the NMC standards are only one part. However, the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 have attempted to simplify medicines legislation while maintaining effective safeguards for public health. The regulations replaced much of the Medicines Act 1968, repealing most of the obsolete law in the process to ensure the legislation is fit for purpose. In the Standards for Medicines Management (NMC 2007a) there are 26 standards detailed that stress the importance of the responsibility all nurses and midwives should have towards safe administration of medicines, including being conversant with local and national policies to maximize public protection. A useful source in providing information about medicines legislation and regulation in the UK that midwives can access is the Medicines Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The NMC has also published guidance for those registrants who have undertaken further training to become nurse or midwife prescribers (NMC 2006a).</p>
                        <h3>Litigation</h3>
                        <p>This is the term used for the process of taking a case through the courts, where a claimant brings a charge against a defendant to seek some form of redress. In healthcare terms, this may be as a consequence of the claimant experiencing an act of trespass to their person by the defendant or suffering harm from the defendant’s actions/omissions that could be proven as negligence. The National Health Service Litigation Authority (NHSLA) manages litigation and other claims against the NHS in England on behalf of member organizations and is responsible for providing advice on human rights case law and handling equal pay claims.</p>
                        <h4>Consent</h4>
                        <p>The concept of consent is complex and this section is intended as only a brief introduction. It is important the midwife or doctor obtains consent from a woman before undertaking any procedure to avoid any future allegations of trespass to the person that may be made against them. Obtaining consent is therefore the legal defence to trespass to the person.</p>
                        <p>Informed consent is taken to mean the reasonable person standard or the Bolam standard (Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee 1957) whereby an individual is given as much information as any reasonable person could be expected to understand in order to make a decision about their care/treatment (DH 2009a). This implies that the person is mentally competent to make such a decision (is legally an adult: 18 years or over) or is not mentally incapacitated in any way. The purpose and significance or potential complication of any procedure or treatment should also be discussed with the childbearing woman by the midwife or doctor. Where possible, the woman should be given time to consider her options before making a decision. This should be done voluntarily and without any duress or undue influence from health professionals, family or friends for it to be valid. Only the woman can give consent for treatment or intervention and although it is desirable if the partner or other relatives are in agreement, ultimately the woman’s views are the only ones that should be taken into consideration (DH 2009a).</p>
                        <p>Incapacity may be temporary, for example as a result of shock, pain, fatigue, confusion, or panic induced by fear. However, it would not usually be reasonable to consider that a woman in labour, experiencing the pain of contractions, would be so affected that she lacked capacity. If a healthcare professional fears that a woman’s decisionmaking (capacity) is impaired they should seek assistance in assessing capacity, which is usually provided by the courts. If a woman requires emergency treatment to save her life, and she is unable to give consent due to being unconscious, treatment can be carried out if it is in her best interests and according to the reasonable standard of the profession (Mental Capacity Act 2005). Once the woman has recovered, the reasons why treatment was necessary must be fully explained to her.</p>
                        <p>In the case of minors (children under 16 years), it is important to carefully assess whether there is evidence that they have sufficient understanding in order to give valid consent, i.e. considered to be Gillick competent (Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech AHA 1985). Although Gillick competence was originally intended to decide whether a child under 16 years can receive contraception without parental knowledge it has, since 1986, had wider applications in health provision and is also referred to as Fraser competence (DH 2009a). It is also advisable that the child’s parents or other accompanying adults are kept informed of any clinical decisions that are made. Where there is a conflict of opinion regarding consent between child and parent, the health professional should always act in the child’s best interest which in some instances may involve the courts determining whether it is lawful to treat the child (DH 2009a).</p>
                        <p>It is good practice that the health professional who is to perform the procedure should be the one to obtain the woman’s consent. Such details of the discussion and decision should be clearly documented in the woman’s records for colleagues to see that consent has been duly obtained or declined.</p>
                        <p>Consent can be implied, verbal or written. It is a common misconception that written consent is more valid than verbal consent when in fact written consent merely serves as evidence of consent. If appropriate information has not been provided, the woman feels that she is under duress or undue influence or she does not have capacity, then a signature on a form will make the consent invalid. It is advised that written consent for significant interventions such as surgery should always be obtained (DH 2009a) but for many procedures such as vaginal examination or phlebotomy verbal consent is sufficient. In an absolute emergency, it may be more appropriate to take witnessed verbal consent for caesarean section rather than spending time on paperwork.</p>
                        <p>Although the law protects the rights of the woman, the fetus does not have any rights until it is born. A mentally competent woman cannot be legally forced to have a caesarean section because of risks to the fetus. However, whilst accepting the law and respecting the woman’s right to refuse such an intervention that may further endanger the life of the fetus, such a situation will be very uncomfortable for any midwife or obstetrician to sit back and allow a fetus to die. Cases such as this can be referred to court for an emergency application to determine whether the intervention can proceed lawfully.</p>
                        <h4>Negligence</h4>
                        <p>It is recognized that the most significant claims in obstetrics arise from birth trauma resulting in cerebral palsy. These are usually based on the allegation that there was negligence on the part of the health professionals involved in the intrapartum care and management, resulting in fetal asphyxia and consequently neurological damage to the baby.</p>
                        <p>The Congenital Disabilities (Civil Liability) Act 1976 enables a child who is born disabled as a result of negligence prior to birth to claim compensation from the person(s) responsible for the negligent act. A mother can only be sued for negligence to her unborn baby if this occurred through dangerous driving. In such cases, the child would sue the mother’s insurance company. There has been an amendment to the Act so that children who have suffered damage during in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment may also obtain compensation. As with all medicolegal cases, for the claimant to be successful, the following need to be proved:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the health professional owed the woman a duty of care</li>
                            <li>there was a breach of duty of care to the woman by the health professional such that the standard of care afforded to her was below the standard that she could reasonably have expected</li>
                            <li>the harm/injury sustained was caused by the breach of duty and</li>
                            <li>damages or other losses such as psychiatric injury (post-traumatic stress disorder/nervous shock, anxiety disorder or adjustment disorder), financial loss (loss of earnings) and future healthcare provision, recognized by the courts as being subject to compensation, have resulted from that harm.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In many cases where a baby suffers neurological damage and develops cerebral palsy, although it may be accepted that the care was substandard, proving causation is more difficult. i.e. whether the substandard care actually resulted in the disability. The situation is complicated by the fact that only a small percentage of babies born with significant neurological damage acquire their disability as a result of events that took place during labour and birth. However, parents will seek to assign the damage to issues of management during the intrapartum period when the health and wellbeing of some babies may have already been chronically compromised before this time.</p>
                        <p>Experts are therefore required to assess the case on behalf of the claimant (the woman or mother on behalf of the baby) and the defendant (usually the hospital Trust) to consider the issues of causation. This may mean that many medicolegal expert opinions are obtained from neonatologists, paediatric neurologists and obstetricians before finally reaching a conclusion.</p>
                        <p>The burden of proof of negligence is on the claimant to prove that on the balance of probabilities it is more likely than not that the defendant was negligent in order for them to be awarded any compensation by the courts. In cases of negligence, compensation is determined by agreeing the liability and the amount (quantum). However, if as a result of negligence the baby has died, then the parents can only recover bereavement costs. Where a fetus dies there is no bereavement costs as the unborn child does not have any legal rights.</p>
                        <h4>Vicarious liability</h4>
                        <p>In the event of an employed midwife being negligent, it would be usual for her employer to be sued. The doctrine of vicarious liability exists to ensure that any innocent victim obtains compensation for injuries caused by an employee. Under this doctrine the employer is responsible for compensation payable for the harm. For vicarious liability to be established the following elements must exist:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>there must be negligence: a duty of care has been breached and as a reasonably foreseeable consequence has caused harm/other failure by the employee</li>
                            <li>the negligent act, omission or failure must have been by an employee</li>
                            <li>the negligent employee must have been acting in the course of their employment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is worth noting that even where the employer is held to be vicariously liable, the midwife who is responsible for harm, such as death of a woman or baby, could be found guilty of manslaughter for their gross negligence which led to the death, could lose their job following disciplinary action and also be struck off the Register following a hearing by the NMC Conduct and Competence Committee.</p>
                        <p>The doctrine of vicarious liability does not necessarily deprive the employer of their rights against the negligent employee. If a midwife has been negligent then they are in breach of their contract of employment that requires them to take all reasonable care and skill. This breach gives the employer a right to be indemnified against the negligent midwife.</p>
                        <p>From 2013 the Health Care and Associated Professions (Indemnity Arrangements) Order 2013 (referred to as The Indemnity Order) specifies that all healthcare professionals, including midwives and nurses, are expected to have indemnity arrangements in place as a condition of their registration. The Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts (CNST) fulfils this requirement so each midwife should be covered via their employer’s membership to CNST.</p>
                        <p>In the case of independent midwives who are selfemployed, they have no vicarious liability or indemnity by an employer and are personally liable for the health and safety of themselves and others. However, from October 2013 all independent midwives in the UK are unable to practise without indemnity cover (The Indemnity Order 2013). It is therefore advisable they secure their own personal indemnity insurance cover as even though they have to have a supervisor of midwives, the supervisor is not liable; neither is supervisor’s employer vicariously liable for the negligence of the independent midwife. However due to the increase in compensation paid out to maternity cases and subsequent rising costs of insurance premiums, many independent midwives are no longer able to function alone. They have either established social enterprise schemes where they commission care from maternity care providers with whom they negotiate professional indemnity insurance cover, or have returned to employment in the NHS.</p>

Being ethically aware is a step towards being an autonomous practitioner: taking responsibility, empowering others and facilitating professional growth and development. The language and terminology, however, can be hard to comprehend and need greater explanation (see Box 2.4).</p>

                        <p>Ethics is often about exploring values and beliefs and clarifying what people understand, think and feel in a certain situation, often from what they say as much as what they do - such actions being underpinned by morality. Beliefs and values are very personal and dependent on many things, such as a person’s background, the society they have been brought up in and the principles and concepts learned since early childhood, such as veracity (truth telling). It is important to reflect on these issues and be open and honest about dilemmas faced in practice. A potential area of conflict is that of law, as law and ethics are often seen as complementary to one another, yet they can also be placed at opposite ends of the spectrum, either creating overlap or creating conflict. Exploring ethics provides a framework to aid resolution of such dilemmas.</p>
                        <h3>Ethical frameworks and theories</h3>
                        <p>There are many ethical frameworks that could be adopted to use in clinical situations and Edwards (1996) advocates a four-level system of moral thinking based on the work of Melia (1989) that can assist in formulating arguments and discussions and ultimately solving moral dilemmas (see Box 2.5).</p>

                        <h4>Level one: Judgements</h4>
                        <p>Judgements are usually readily made, based on information on individual gains. Such judgements may have no real foundation except the belief of the individual who made it. They may therefore be biased and not necessarily well thought through or based on all the available evidence. What informs a judgment is often linked to personal values and beliefs, societal influences as well as experiences of similar past events. It is important that midwives reflect on past judgements to consider if in retrospect they were well founded or based on personal bias or prejudice.</p>
                        <h4>Level two: Rules</h4>
                        <p>Rules govern our daily lives and are determined by the society or culture in which we live. In terms of ethics, rules are what guide the midwife’s practice and control their actions. According to Beauchamp and Childress (2012) rules come in different forms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Substantive rules: cover issues such as privacy, confidentiality or truth telling</li>
                            <li>Authority rules: are determined by those in power and enforced on a country or section of society</li>
                            <li>Procedural rules: define a set course of action or line that should be followed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The midwife should recognize that rules can be enabling in that they define clear limits or boundaries of practice, allowing freedom to act knowing the safe limits of those actions. The NMC (2012b) Midwives Rules and Standards are statutory rules bound by legal processes but can guide and enable practice when used appropriately and as a consequence ease any ethical dilemmas. The Code (NMC 2008) is less formal or obligatory than rules and is viewed as a set of guidelines to support safe practice among midwives as well as nurses.</p>
                        <h4>Level three: Principles</h4>
                        <p>There are four main principles which are usually applied specifically within health care and midwifery practice:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Respect for autonomy: respecting another’s right to self-determine a course of action: e.g. placing women at the centre of maternity care where their views and wishes are seen as key to the decision-making process in care delivery.</li>
                            <li>Non-maleficence: Primum non nocere - above all, do no harm or cause no hurt.</li>
                            <li>Beneficence: compassion, taking positive action to do good or balance the benefits or harm in a given situation. This principle can cause a particular dilemma when a woman chooses a course of action that may not be in her and her fetus/baby’s best interests.</li>
                            <li>Justice: to treat everyone fairly and as equals. This principle also encompasses fair access for all women to the same level and options of health and maternity services, including place of birth.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Level four: Ethical theories</h4>
                        <p>There are a number of theories that could be explored and applied to healthcare and midwifery practice, e.g. liberalism, ethical relativism, feminism and casuistry are just some of them. The two main normative ethical theories that are at either end of the spectrum are utilitarianism (consequentialism) and deontology.</p>
                        <h5>Utilitarianism</h5>
                        <p>This theory considers actions in terms of their probable consequences and originates from the Greek telos meaning end or purpose, such that this theory is sometimes referred to as teleological theory. Although the original theory’s aim was for all actions to create the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people, the word happiness has been criticized, as for some individuals actions may result in a degree of unhappiness. It is therefore more apt to consider this theory as substituting happiness for the word good or benefit: that is, the greatest good/benefit for the greatest number.</p>
                        <p>Many aspects of midwifery practice have been implemented on utilitarian principles: e.g. antenatal and neonatal screening tests are offered to all women irrespective of need or individual assessment to benefit society as a whole. However, midwives do need to be mindful that whilst the majority of women may opt for the testing to identify any potential health risks and consequential treatment, unhappiness may be evoked for some women as fear and anxiety is associated with the choice to accept or decline such a test.</p>
                        <p>There are two types of this theory: act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism. Act utilitarianism was developed by Bentham, Mill and Sidgwick in the 18th and 19th centuries and is the purer form of the two types. The theory expects every potential action to be assessed according to its predicted outcomes in terms of benefit. In comparison, rule utilitarianism considers moral rules that are intended to ensure the greatest benefit, such that each act is assessed to how it conforms to the rules. Practically, utilitarianism theory is attractive in that it can aid decision making for the masses, such that an action is good if it provides benefits for the majority.</p>
                        <h5>Deontology</h5>
                        <p>This particular ethical theory derives from the Greek term deon, meaning duty, rule or obligation, and was formulated around the right thing to do without regard to the consequences by the German metaphysician, Immanuel Kant. All health professionals would appreciate they have a duty towards their patients/clients, but as shown in Box 2.6, they may have duties in other areas that they need to consider and balance in order to make appropriate decisions to take the best course of action. How duty is interpreted may vary according to the individual’s personal situation, their values or beliefs with some individuals basing their duty on natural laws, religion and the Ten Commandments (traditional deontology).</p>

                        </aside>
                        <p>The philosophy behind Kant’s theory reflects that to act morally is concerned with truth-telling and out of respect for duty, regardless of the circumstances. Kant believed that the actions of an individual should always be rational and stem from good will, that is to say, duty for its own sake, namely the categorical imperative, which is expressed as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Act only according to that maxim by which you can also will that it would become a universal law.</li>
                            <li>Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This highlights that an action can only be moral if it can be applied to everyone universally: if everyone was to do it. Kant believed all individuals to be autonomous and rational and should be treated with respect rather merely as a means to an end. Beauchamp and Childress (2012) consider that if an action necessitates treating someone without respect then it is the action that is wrong. In maternity care, respecting women as individuals with their own personal experiences is fundamental to the role of the midwife.</p>
                        <p>Although the NHS and other healthcare providers are generally utilitarian, midwifery, nursing, medicine and other such disciplines adopt a more deontological approach. The duty of care which is the duty that health professionals are most familiar with, is in essence embedded in the text of The Code (NMC 2008).</p>
                        <p>Conflicting duties can cause dilemmas in deciding the best course of action. Casuistry is a system that can assist in prioritizing duties according to the circumstances. However, most people deal with conflicts and dilemmas in their lives without having an appreciation of these theories. Nevertheless, whether midwives opt to utilize formal or informal approaches to assist their ethical decisionmaking in practice, to have knowledge of each of them is important in order to understand how some decisions are made. Furthermore, having knowledge of ethical theories can help midwives to appreciate why certain approaches are taken by the employing organization/management when changes or implementation of innovations are proposed in practice.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of supervision of midwives is to protect women and babies by actively promoting safe standards of midwifery practice. Supervision is a statutory responsibility that provides a mechanism for support and guidance to all midwives practising in the UK, empowering them to work within the full scope of their role (NMC 2013). The philosophy of midwifery supervision and the standards it develops reflect the key themes of clinical governance described in NHS First Class Service (DH 1998). These themes are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>professional self-regulation</li>
                            <li>clinical governance</li>
                            <li>life-long learning.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Historical context</h3>
                        <p>The concept of the supervision of midwives was established in the UK in Edwardian times with the passing of the 1902 Midwives Act (England and Wales), the Midwives (Scotland) Act in 1915 and the Midwives (Ireland) Act in 1918 that led to the setting up of a Central Midwives Board (CMB) in the respective countries. Under these Acts, the CMBs that initially had a medical majority had the power to frame the rules to govern midwifery practice and the authority to enforce their compliance. Midwives who disobeyed or ignored the rules or who were guilty of negligence, malpractice or personal or professional misconduct were consequently disciplined or suspended from practice. At this time, failure to submit an intention to practise (ITP) form or submitting incomplete details would result in the midwife incurring a fine.</p>
                        <p>Although the CMBs had the responsibility for supervising the effective running of the profession, much of the responsibility for the supervision of midwives lay with Local Authorities (LA) that were under the control of county councils/county borough councils. As a consequence of the LAs acquiring extensive powers by the CMBs, they eventually became known as Local Supervising Authorities (LSA). The extent of the functioning powers of the LSA included:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the supervision of midwives practising within their district in accordance with the CMB rules;</li>
                            <li>investigating allegations of malpractice, negligence or misconduct;</li>
                            <li>reporting the names of any practising midwife convicted of an offence;</li>
                            <li>suspending a midwife from practice if they were likely to be a source of infection;</li>
                            <li>reporting the death of any midwife;</li>
                            <li>receiving the notification of intention to practise from each practising midwife within their district; and</li>
                            <li>submitting a roll of midwives annually to the CMB.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The role of the LSA Officer was undertaken by the Medical Officer of Health (MOH) who passed on the bulk of their LSA work to non-medical inspectors. The first inspectors were often clergymen’s daughters, members of the local gentry, or relatives of the MOH (Heagerty 1996). These individuals were used to supervising subordinates and had domestic standards much higher than those of the working-class midwives. As a result, they were extremely critical of the poor environments in which many of the midwives lived and practised at this time. The inspectors were at liberty to inspect the midwives in any way they felt appropriate. They could follow them on their rounds, visit their homes, question the women they had cared for and even investigate their personal lives in addition to inspecting their equipment (Kirkham 1996). Records could not be checked as they were rarely made due to the fact that many midwives were illiterate, notwithstanding their immense practical knowledge and independence.</p>
                        <p>The Midwives Act 1936 empowered the CMB to set rules requiring midwives to attend refresher courses and determined the qualifications of medical and non-medical inspectors: the latter being practising midwives. In 1937, further expansion of the 1936 Midwives Act stated that inspectors of midwives were to be known as ‘supervisors of midwives’ with their role being more of a counsellor and friend.</p>
                        <p>In 1974 the National Health Service (Reorganization) Act 1973 designated Regional Health Authorities in England and Area Health Authorities in Wales as LSAs. By 1977 the medical supervisor role had been abolished with all subsequent supervisors being practising midwives. The reorganization also led to supervision being introduced into the hospital environment as well as in the community.</p>
                        <p>The Midwives Act 1951 and Midwives (Scotland) Act 1951 required LSAs, through the supervisors of midwives, to ensure midwives attended statutory postgraduate courses (refresher courses). This statutory requirement continued until 2001 when Rule 37 (UKCC 1998) was superseded by the Post Registration Education and Practice (PREP) standards (UKCC 1997) and the subsequent developments in midwives' continuing professional development as a consequence of the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001 and its amendments.</p>
                        <p>The responsibility for monitoring the statutory supervision of midwives is through the regulator, the NMC and detailed in the Midwives Rules and Standards (NMC 2012b). The Standards for the Preparation and Practice of Supervisors of Midwives (NMC 2006b) provides further detail and clarity about the statutory supervision of midwives.</p>
                        <h3>Supervision of midwives in the 21st century</h3>
                        <p>Many of the historic functions of the statutory supervision of midwives continue today, although they exist in a much more supportive fashion. The principal aim of statutory supervision of midwives is still the protection of the public, however the philosophy is centred on promoting best practice and excellence in care, preventing poor practice and intervening in unacceptable practice. Effective use of the supervisory framework leads to improvements in the standard of midwifery care and better outcomes for women. This endorses the need for midwives and supervisors of midwives to work towards a common aim of providing the best possible care for women and babies through a mutual responsibility for effective communication. Consequently, there is much more emphasis placed on discussion, support and continuing professional development needs with the supervisor of midwives providing a confidential framework for a supportive relationship with the midwife.</p>
                        <p>Midwives are still required to give notice to each LSA in whose area they intend to practise, before commencing to practise there. Subsequently midwives must give notice in respect of each 12 month period in which they intend to continue practising within a specific location (NMC 2012b: Rule 3). The intention to practise (ITP) documentation is now linked to the registrant’s entry on the midwives part of the NMC register. This confirms the midwife’s eligibility to practise to an employer and the public rather than the midwife merely having an effective registration.</p>
                        <h4>Local Supervising Authorities</h4>
                        <p>Local Supervising Authorities (LSA) are organizations within geographical areas, responsible for ensuring that statutory supervision of midwives is undertaken according to the standards set by the NMC under article 43 of the Nursing and Midwifery Order (The Order) 2001: details of which are set out in the Midwives Rules and Standards (NMC 2012b).</p>
                        <p>The Order states that each LSA shall:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>exercise general supervision over all midwives practising in its area;</li>
                            <li>where it appears that the fitness to practise of a midwife in its area is impaired, report it to the Council; and</li>
                            <li>have power in accordance with the rules made under Article 42 [of The Order] to suspend a midwife from practice.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Local Supervising Authority arrangements differ across the UK. In England the LSA is NHS England, in Wales, it is Healthcare Inspectorate Wales, in Scotland it rests with the Health Boards and in Northern Ireland, the LSA is the Public Health Agency. Although the LSA role has no management responsibility to these organizations, it does act as a focus for issues relating to midwifery practice with its strength lying in its influence on quality in local maternity services.</p>
                        <h4>Role of the LSA Midwifery Officer</h4>
                        <p>Each LSA has an appointed LSA Midwifery Officer (LSAMO) employed to carry out the LSA function who is professionally accountable to the NMC. The LSAMO is a practising midwife with experience in statutory supervision and who provides an essential point of contact for supervisors of midwives to consult for advice on aspects of supervision. Members of the public who seek help or support concerning the provision of midwifery care can also contact the LSAMO directly.</p>
                        <p>The LSAMO provides leadership, support and guidance on a range of matters including professional development and also contributes to the wider NHS agenda by supporting public health and inter-professional activities at national level. It is a unique role in that it does not represent the interests of either the commissioners or providers of NHS maternity services. A list of the functions of the LSA, as discharged by the LSAMO, can be found in Box 2.7.</p>

                        <p>Having regular contact with supervisors of midwives and being part of the LSAMO Forum UK ensures that each LSA Midwifery Officer has detailed knowledge of contemporary issues to enable the development of midwifery practice in meeting the needs of women and their families (Bacon 2011). One of the many aims of the LSAMO Forum UK is to ensure that it contributes to maintaining a consistent and equitable approach to supervision through UK wide guidance.</p>
                        <h4>Selection and preparation of supervisors of midwives</h4>
                        <p>The statutory supervision of midwives is a valuable component of midwifery practice, however its success reflects the ability of those who are appointed as supervisors of midwives. It is therefore important to have robust highquality preparation and ongoing assessment of performance. However, formal courses of instruction for supervisors of midwives did not exist until 1978, and it was not until the English National Board for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting (ENB) developed an Open Learning Programme at Diploma level in 1992 (ENB 1992) that training to become a supervisor of midwives prior to appointment became a requirement.</p>
                        <p>The standards for the preparation and practice of supervisors of midwives (NMC 2006b) outline the standards of competence that underpin the principles of statutory supervision of midwives, in accordance with the Midwives Rules and Standards (NMC 2012b: Rule 9). Programmes of education are now delivered at first degree or masters level by Higher Education Institutions (HEI) and are approved and monitored annually by the NMC (NMC 2006b). Midwives must complete the course successfully before being eligible for appointment as a supervisor of midwife.</p>
                        <h4>Role and responsibilities of the supervisor of midwives</h4>
                        <p>Supervisors of midwives are independent of the employer and often work in a team. Their role is different from the midwifery manager, who is responsible to the employer to make sure that maternity services run effectively. Supervisors of midwives are accountable to the LSA and are supported in their role by the LSAMO. They provide leadership and guidance to midwives that include a 24 -hour service provision for midwives and women (NMC 2007b; LSAMO Forum UK 2009).</p>
                        <p>Each supervisor has a professional and practice responsibility to ensure that the practice within their own clinical area is evidence-based, to challenge and monitor midwifery practice, set standards and carry out clinical audit. They must ensure that their personal supervisees have access to the NMC statutory rules and standards (NMC 2012b) and The Code (NMC 2008), and to local and national clinical guidelines. Among their many duties, a supervisor is responsible to audit records, arrange regular meetings with their supervisees at least annually and work with them to identify any areas of practice requiring development. A list of the responsibilities of a supervisor of midwives is provided in Box 2.8.</p>

                        <h3>Statutory supervision in action</h3>
                        <p>Each supervisor of midwives is in an excellent position to identify good practice and also to learn of examples of good practice in other maternity units through the supervisory network that can be adopted within their own units. Where midwives have ideas for changing and improving practice, supervisors should be able to empower them to introduce such change and support them in their initiatives, acting as their advocate with senior staff.</p>
                        <h4>Partnership between supervisor and midwife/supervisee</h4>
                        <p>To benefit from supervision, mutual respect between the supervisor of midwives and their midwives/supervisees is essential. Midwives should work in partnership with their supervisors and make the most of supervision (LSAMO Forum UK 2009), so that it can be effective not only for themselves but also for the mothers and babies for whom they care.</p>
                        <p>The primary responsibilities of a midwife are to ensure the safe and efficient care of women and their babies, and to maintain personal fitness for practice to sustain their registration with the NMC. The supervisory relationship enables, supports and empowers midwives to fulfil these responsibilities. Figure 2.1 demonstrates how midwives can make the most of supervision and the benefits of a professional relationship with their named supervisor of midwives.</p>

It shows a cycle: A midwife should know her supervisor and how to contact them. They should prepare for the annual meeting. This meeting is an opportunity for confidential discussion and professional support, allowing reflection on practice and identification of learning needs. The midwife then develops a personal development plan with their supervisor, accesses support as needed throughout the year, and ultimately enhances practice and confidence, completing the cycle." class="content-image">

                        <h4>Supervisory reviews</h4>
                        <p>Supervisory reviews provide midwives with an opportunity to take time out with their named supervisor of midwives to consider personal learning needs and professional development requirements. These review meetings can be used to consider mechanisms for gaining relevant experience in other areas and receiving the necessary professional knowledge and skills.</p>
                        <p>Midwives are responsible for meeting their own PREP requirements before re-registering with the NMC (2011) and these requirements can be discussed with the supervisor of midwives during the review. The supervisor will be able to guide the midwife if further academic study is being considered. The review also provides an opportunity to evaluate practice and share any practice issues causing concern. If it is felt necessary, the supervisor will investigate the matter and take appropriate action.</p>
                        <p>Although it is customary for only one supervisory review a year, midwives are able to access their supervisor as and when required. As many supervisors hold clinical posts, they often work alongside the midwives they supervise and have more regular contact on an informal basis. Being valued and supported by supervisors and having achievements recognized enhances midwives’ professional confidence and practice. The supervisory decisions perceived as empowering are those made by a consensus between the supervisor and the midwife (Stapleton et al 1998). If this relationship is not recognized by either midwife or supervisor, then the opportunity to change supervisor should be taken by the midwife to enable the necessary rapport and confidence in the supervisory relationship for it to be successful. It benefits some midwives to change their supervisor every few years, while others feel the need for a longer-term relationship.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Clinical governance was introduced in British health policy as a term to describe the accountability processes for the safety, quality and effectiveness of clinical care delivered to service users (DH 1997; Scottish Executive 1997; Welsh Office 1998; Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety [DHSSPS] 2001). It was originally defined in First Class Service (DH 1998: 33) as</p>
                        <blockquote>a framework through which NHS organizations are accountable for continuously improving the quality of their services and safeguarding high standards of care by creating an environment in which excellence in clinical care will flourish.</blockquote>
                        <p>According to Jaggs-Fowler (2011), clinical governance has developed beyond simply being a moral principle and is now a statutory duty for all NHS organizations to address, forming part of the overall drive to improve quality. It is just one component of the management tools variously known as total quality management and continuous quality improvement.</p>
                        <p>As part of implementing the concept of clinical governance, two government-appointed bodies, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE] (known as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence from 2013) and the National Commissioning Board (a peer and lay body), were initially introduced in England to standardize, improve and assess the quality of clinical practice on a national basis. However, with the extensive reorganization of the National Health Service (NHS) as a result of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, five key national bodies have been assigned to coordinate consistent governance of the NHS in England:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Department of Health</li>
                            <li>The NHS Commissioning Board: NHS England</li>
                            <li>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</li>
                            <li>The Care Quality Commission</li>
                            <li>The economic regulator Monitor.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) now operate as statutory bodies replacing Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) and Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs) and consequently have taken over the responsibility for commissioning the vast majority of NHS services, including hospital care, community and mental health services. In addition, local CCGs are responsible for monitoring the quality of the care provided.</p>
                        <p>Within the context of local midwifery practice, the focus of clinical governance lies in the effective partnership between women and health professionals and the establishment of midwifery networks where the voice of service users assists in shaping local maternity services, policies, protocols, guidelines and standards. In addition, professional bodies endorse the importance of health professionals working, learning and collaborating to provide safe and effective care to childbearing women, their babies and families (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [RCOG], RCM, Royal College of Anaesthetists [RCoA], Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health [RCPCH] 2007; RCOG, RCM, RCoA 2008; RCOG 2009). Regular monitoring visits by the LSA Midwifery Officer, and by national bodies such as the Care Quality Commission (CQC) (England), Healthcare Improvement Scotland, Healthcare Inspectorate Wales, the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (Northern Ireland) and periodical assessments by the NMC means that, from a clinical governance perspective, there can be confidence in the standard of care provided in each maternity unit.</p>
                        <h3>The key components of clinical governance</h3>
                        <p>Clinical governance should be an integrated process in all aspects of health care delivery and the various processes underpinning it should in themselves be integrated with each other (Jaggs-Fowler 2011). With this in mind the key components of clinical governance can be grouped into three main categories: clinical effectiveness, risk management and patient focus and public involvement, all of which contribute to the delivery of high-quality care as summarized in Box 2.9. However, it may also be prudent to acknowledge that effective leadership and interpersonal skills are also vital components to the successful governance of an organization.</p>

                        <h3>Policies, protocols, guidelines and standards</h3>
                        <p>All healthcare providers are required to have policies, protocols, guidelines and standards in place to govern safe, effective and quality care to the public. It is important that midwives understand the differences between these definitions in order to utilize them appropriately in their clinical practice.</p>
                        <p>Policies are general principles or directions, usually without the mandatory approach for addressing an issue. They are a means of ensuring a consistent standard of care to avoid any confusion over practice and are often set at national level, for example Midwifery 2020 (DH 2010) and A Refreshed Framework for Maternity Services in Scotland (Scottish Government 2011). Policies should make clear the procedures that will be followed by midwives, doctors and support staff. There are differing views about the benefits of policies, ranging from ensuring safe practice and providing consistency, to restricting midwives’ autonomy. Indeed, if a midwife’s clinical judgement on an individual woman’s care is at odds with policy, she may be in breach of her contract of employment unless she can justify her actions.</p>
                        <p>The term protocol is often used interchangeably with ‘guideline’. A protocol is usually regarded as a local initiative that practitioners are expected to follow, but may also vary in meaning, e.g. a written agreement between parties, a multidisciplinary action plan for managing care, or an action plan for a clinical trial. Protocols therefore determine individual aspects of practice and should be based on the latest evidence. Most protocols are binding on employees as they usually relate to the management of individuals with urgent, life-threatening conditions, for example antepartum haemorrhage, such that if the practitioner does not work within the protocol they would be deemed to be in breach of their employment contract. However, it would not be expected to have protocols for the care of healthy women experiencing a physiological labour and birth.</p>
                        <p>Guidelines are usually less specific than protocols and may be described as suggestions for criteria or levels of performance that are provided to implement agreed standards. Both guidelines and standards should be based on contemporary, reliable research findings and include specific outcomes which act as performance indicators, upon which progress can be measured as evidence of achievement within an agreed timescale. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) sets guidelines for clinical practice in all areas of health care, including maternity and neonatal care to provide good practice guidance for midwives and obstetricians. Supervisors of midwives play an important role in facilitating midwives to implement these guidelines within their own scope of practice. The interpretation and application of a guideline remains the responsibility of individual practitioners, as they should be aware of local circumstances and the needs and wishes of informed women. Guidelines are therefore tools to assist the midwife in making the most appropriate clinical decision in partnership with the woman, based on best available evidence.</p>
                        <p>It is acknowledged that there is a plethora of clinical guidelines not only produced by NICE but also organizations such as the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), RCOG and RCM. However, as variations in outcomes persist, it is essential that commissioners build into their contracts the requirements to deliver services to national standards and to manage performance against these. It is the responsibility of the Care Quality Commission in England, Healthcare Improvement Scotland, the Regulator and Quality Improvement Authority in Northern Ireland and Healthcare Inspectorate Wales to monitor health services against national standards in the respective UK countries.</p>
                        <h3>Audit</h3>
                        <p>Clinical audit is a process that is undertaken to review and evaluate the effectiveness of practice by measuring standards of health/midwifery care against national benchmarks. It is important to ensure that the auditing process is comprehensive, multidisciplinary and centred upon the women who receive the care and that the audit loop is closed completely. This means that should the data collected reveal any shortfall in meeting clinical standards, strategies to rectify such a deficit should always be implemented. Furthermore, when a change in practice is implemented, there should always be an evaluation to ensure the audit cycle develops into an audit spiral, leading to improved health care.</p>
                        <p>In midwifery, local surveys should take place regularly to monitor women’s satisfaction with their maternity care to ensure these achieve the expected standards as well as identify areas for improvement. To address clinical governance, each maternity unit/service is expected to publish its local statistics and monitor generic indicators of the effectiveness and efficiency of health care. Such outcomes include healthcare-acquired infection (HCAI), infant mortality, neonatal mortality and stillbirths, women’s experiences of childbirth and admission of fullterm babies to neonatal care (DH 2012), as shown in Box 2.10.</p>

                        <p>Health care-associated infections (HCAIs) have become the subject of considerable public interest as a consequence in the rise in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (‘MRSA’) and Clostridium difficile (‘C. diff’). This is of particular concern to the maternity services as the latest Confidential Enquiries into maternal deaths reported that the leading cause of direct deaths during the triennium 2006-2008 was sepsis, accounting for 26 deaths (Harper 2011). Consequently, the prevention of infection was one of the top 10 recommendations from the report. However, with the introduction of a national strategy to reduce the rates of MRSA and C. diff, there is evidence that the rates of both types of infection have more than halved (National Patient Safety Agency [NPSA] 2007a, 2007b; National Audit Office 2009).</p>
                        <h3>Risk management</h3>
                        <p>Risk management is the systematic identification, analysis and control of any potential and actual risk and of any circumstances that put individuals at risk of harm. The concept was introduced in the mid-1990s with the principal aim of reducing litigation costs. Organizations such as the UK NHS are expected to adhere to the legislation pertaining to health and safety in the work place and other legal principles such as the duty of care to both the public and employees as part of their risk management strategy (CQC 2010; NHSLA 2013). Managing risk is therefore a fundamental component of clinical governance.</p>
                        <p>When a risk is evaluated it is not only important to consider the probability of something adverse happening but also the consequences if it should happen. In the context of health care, risk is usually associated with health risks, injury and death. More specifically within the context of maternity care, the risk of harm would include injury to a woman and/or her baby during childbirth or to a health professional engaged in providing maternity care. The risk of detriment is associated with some form of economic/ social loss, which may not only include a valuation of harm to individuals but also damage on a much wider scale, such as adverse publicity for the local maternity services. All health service managers are expected to be conversant in risk management theory in order to identify and manage risk so that the probability of harm or detriment is lessened and the consequences of risk are reduced.</p>
                        <p>The introduction of the Modified Early Obstetric Warning Scoring (MEOWS) system (NICE 2007; DH 2009b; Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries [CMACE] 2011) has contributed to the recognition of early warning signs in those women identified at risk of developing serious complications and life-threatening conditions to prompt earlier initiation of high-level care and more senior involvement in care planning and management.</p>
                        <p>Poor communication among health professionals is often criticized as being the commonest cause of preventable adverse outcomes in hospitals and a significant cause of written complaints (Health and Social Care Information Centre [HSCIC] 2012). An inquiry into the safety of birth in England found that when there are increased risks to the woman or baby, that render some births less safe, functioning teams are the key to improving the outcome for the woman and baby (Kings Fund 2008).</p>
                        <p>The use of the Situation, Background, Assessment and Recommendation (SBAR) tool (NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement 2008) can assist in improving communication among members of the multiprofessional team. Its purpose is to enable health professionals to frame concise and focused information about the condition of a childbearing woman that requires immediate attention and action. Consequently, the SBAR tool assists in clarifying which information should be communicated between health professionals, enabling the development of efficient teamwork and the fostering of a culture of safety (RCOG 2009).</p>
                        <h4>Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts (CNST)</h4>
                        <p>The Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts (CNST) is a voluntary risk-pooling scheme for negligence claims arising out of incidents occurring after 1 April 1995. It is administered by the NHSLA, and all NHS Trusts, Foundation Trusts and Clinical Commissioning Groups (formerly PCTS) in England subscribe to CNST by paying an insurance premium based on their individual compliance to certain general standards. There are equivalent schemes in Scotland (Clinical Negligence and Other Risks Indemnity Scheme [CNORIS]), in Wales (the Welsh Risk Pool) and Northern Ireland. The NHSLA (2013) have produced a special standard for maternity services with a set of additional criteria and minimum requirements for specific situations. The basis of the standard relate to the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>organization</li>
                            <li>clinical care</li>
                            <li>high-risk conditions</li>
                            <li>communication</li>
                            <li>postnatal and neonatal care.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Consequently, risk management is an essential mission with significant funding implications for all healthcare providers striving for excellence.</p>
                        <p>It has been reported by the NHSLA (2012) that within the decade 2000-2010 over £3.1 billion was paid out in damages in a total of 5087 maternity claims to babies and mothers who were injured as a result of harm incurred during childbirth. In this period there were 5.5 million births, thus less than 1 in every 1000 births (0.1%) had become the subject of a claim, indicating that the vast majority of births do not result in a clinical negligence claim. Nevertheless, although obstetric and gynaecology claims accounted for 20% of the total number of claims the NHSLA received, it is significant to note that this area of practice was in fact responsible for 49% of the total value as compensation often involves 24 -hour care for the claimant for the rest of their lives.</p>
                        <h4>Clinical governance, risk management and statutory supervision of midwives</h4>
                        <p>The statutory supervision of midwives is a vital element of leadership and clinical governance within the maternity services that also supports risk management by monitoring the development of maternity services and standards of midwifery practice such that women receive care that is both safe and of a high quality. An illustration of how the statutory supervision of midwives sits within clinical governance.</p>
                        <p>The nature of statutory supervision of midwives can limit the volume of serious adverse incidents within an organization by its supportive educative function to each individual midwife. In addition, the LSA Midwifery Officers regularly monitor standards of practice against documented evidence such as the Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths, stillbirths and infant deaths reports as well as national standards and guidelines, through their supervisory audit visits to each maternity unit. Where there are unacceptable variations in clinical midwifery practice or care is inappropriate for women’s needs, the LSA Midwifery Officer as an outside assessor is in a position to recommend remedial action (NMC 2012a). In addition, the LSA can contribute to the dissemination of national standards, such as safeguarding practices, to ensure the implementation of the most effective care at a local level.</p>
                        <p>Local Supervising Authorities (LSAs) must publish guidelines for investigating incidents including near misses, complaints or concerns relating to midwifery practice or allegations of impaired fitness to practice against a midwife (NMC 2012b: Rule 10). The guidelines should include a time frame for the investigation and a communication strategy between the supervisor of midwives, the LSA and the employer (if the midwife is employed), a support mechanism for the midwife undergoing investigation and a procedure for obtaining an account of the woman and her family’s experience. There should also be details of the action to be taken upon completion of the investigation, including disseminating the report and reporting to the midwife’s employer or other healthcare regulators should the investigation find issues with systems or governance or other professions that may have contributed to unsafe practice. On occasion supervisory investigations are conducted by supervisors outside of the area where the practice concern arose. The benefits of externally led investigations as determined by Paeglis (2012: 25) include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>no confusion for the midwives or employers that this is a LSA and not a management process;</li>
                            <li>complete objectivity;</li>
                            <li>a fresh eyes approach to practice issues that might previously have been accepted as custom and practice;</li>
                            <li>sharing of good midwifery and supervisory practice and of lessons learned.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Should there be an appeal against a decision, the LSA Midwifery Officer is responsible for convening a local panel to review the handling of the investigation and the outcome in order to decide upon any further action.</p>
                        <p>Following an investigation, the LSA may recommend no action, local action under the supervision of a named supervisor of midwives or a LSA practice programme/referral to the NMC. Box 2.11 identifies the outcomes arising from a LSA investigation and the subsequent actions taken.</p>
