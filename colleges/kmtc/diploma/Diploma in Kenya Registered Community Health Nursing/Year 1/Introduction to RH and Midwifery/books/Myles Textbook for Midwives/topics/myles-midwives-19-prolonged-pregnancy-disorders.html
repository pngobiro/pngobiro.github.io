                        <p>This chapter examines the evidence relating to prolonged pregnancy, induction of labour, prolonged labour and precipitate labour. Any decision with regards to the management of a pregnancy that continues beyond term is based on discussion between the woman and obstetrician, but the midwife is in a unique position to help the woman make sense of such discussions, thereby enabling her to make an informed decision based on informed choice. When labour is induced, when there is failure to progress in labour or when labour is prolonged, with or without further complications, the midwife remains in a key position to ensure the woman is kept informed so that she is enabled to continue to exercise her ability to be autonomous in the plan of care of her own labour and birth and the execution of that plan. The role of the midwife in the care of the woman will be discussed throughout.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-1" class="section-heading">PROLONGED PREGNANCY</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Much of the confusion when exploring the research and other evidence on pregnancies that go beyond the expected date of birth (EDB) and more specifically beyond 42 weeks (294 days) lies in the terms used to describe such pregnancies such as post-term pregnancy, prolonged pregnancy and postdates. According to Hermus et al (2009) post-term pregnancy is defined as a pregnancy where the gestation exceeds 42 completed weeks (294 days). This definition is also used by others when referring to prolonged pregnancy (NICE [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence] 2008a; Simpson and Stanley 2011). Gülmezoglu et al (2012) refer to pregnancies that go beyond 294 days as both post-term and postdate.</p>
                        <p>What is clear is that all these terms refer to a specific gestation of the pregnancy and not the fetus or neonate. For the purposes of this chapter the term prolonged pregnancy will be used to describe a pregnancy equal to or beyond 42 weeks. Postmaturity refers to a description of the neonate with peeling of the epidermis, long nails, loose skin suggestive of recent weight loss and an alert face (Koklanaris and Tropper 2006). The relationship, if any, between prolonged pregnancy and postmaturity will be explored later in the chapter.</p>
                        <p>If prolonged pregnancy is defined by weeks of gestation, whether this is based on a calculation of the EDB using Naegele's rule or by ultrasound scan no later than 16 weeks, is to consider women as a homogenous group and neglects, among other things, the racial variations with shorter gestational age in South Asian and Black women (Balchin et al 2007). If the anxiety pertaining to prolonged pregnancy is possible adverse neonatal outcome then perhaps we need to consider how prolonged pregnancy is defined for these groups of women. Laursen et al (2004) suggest the notion of prolonged pregnancy as 'a normal variation of human gestation'. According to Hovi et al (2006) only a small proportion of prolonged pregnancies have babies that are postmature as described above.</p>
                        <h3>INCIDENCE</h3>
                        <p>According to NICE (2008a), the frequency or incidence of prolonged pregnancy is between 5% and 10%. The wide variation is a reflection of the disparate definitions as highlighted above, the number of women where EDB is uncertain and different induction policies (Simpson and Stanley 2011). Based on a definition of equal to or more than 42 weeks a true incidence of prolonged pregnancy is difficult to assess because in many cases women's labour is induced before reaching that time for specific complications in the pregnancy, for maternal request or because the pregnancy has gone beyond the EDB. According to the Department of Health (DH 2006), prolonged pregnancy was the most common indication given for induction of labour (IOL) in England, accounting for approximately 46% of inductions overall. Unfortunately the latest figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC 2012) do not provide the same breakdown of statistics, only giving an overall induction rate for England for 2011-2012 of 22.1%. It is acknowledged that in this period in England 4.2% of women gave birth at 42 weeks and over (HSCIC 2012).</p>
                        <p>The use of an early ultrasound scan to date the pregnancy (Chapter 11), whether or not there is uncertainty with the last menstrual period (LMP), is thought by many to reduce the number of pregnancies categorized as prolonged (Ragunath and McKewan 2007; NICE 2008a; Simpson and Stanley 2011; Tun and Tuohy 2011; Oros et al 2012). Both accurately defining prolonged pregnancy and the accurate dating of a pregnancy is important if the woman is to be advised appropriately regarding the possible risks when discussing the options of expectant management or IOL where pregnancy is prolonged in order to avoid unnecessary intervention in an otherwise 'low-risk' pregnancy.</p>
                        <h3>Possible implications for mother, fetus and baby</h3>
                        <p>In exploring the research and other evidence, a number of studies suggest there is an increase in perinatal mortality and morbidity as the pregnancy goes beyond 41 weeks (Hermus et al 2009; Simpson and Stanley 2011; Cheyne et al 2012; Gülmezoglu et al 2012; Oros et al 2012). Whilst many authors acknowledge that the 'absolute risk is small' (NICE 2008a; McCarthy and Kenny 2010; Simpson and Stanley 2011; Cheyne et al 2012; Gülmezoglu et al 2012), this information almost appears as an afterthought and not worthy of further discussion. If prolonged pregnancy is to be perceived as a 'complication' the possible 'risks' need to be viewed from the perspectives of the mother, fetus and neonate with regards to morbidity and mortality.</p>
                        <p>Simpson and Stanley (2011) suggest that if a pregnancy continues beyond 41 completed weeks the risks for the mother are associated with a large for gestational age or macrosomic infant such as shoulder dystocia, genital tract trauma, operative birth and postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). In an otherwise low-risk pregnancy such risks must be balanced with the risks of IOL, such as increased need for epidural anaesthesia, uterine hyperstimulation, operative birth, PPH and failed induction (Ragunath and McKewan 2007; Hermus et al 2009; McCarthy and Kenny 2010; Bailit et al 2010; Gülmezoglu et al 2012; Jowitt 2012; Oros et al 2012).</p>
                        <p>According to Simpson and Stanley (2011), the possible risks for the fetus and neonate in a prolonged pregnancy appear to be two-fold: placental dysfunction linked to oligohydramnios, restricted fetal growth, meconium aspiration, asphyxia and still birth; conversely the cases where growth continues resulting in a macrosomic infant at risk of bony injury, soft tissue trauma, hypoxia and cerebral haemorrhage. The work of Fox (1997) suggests that the changes in the placenta over the course of pregnancy are part of a process of maturation and an increase in functional efficiency as opposed to a decrease in functional efficiency. Given that few post-term neonates exhibit signs of postmaturity, possible changes in placental function might be more appropriately linked to pregnancies where the neonate displays such characteristics rather than in prolonged pregnancies per se (Koklanaris and Tropper 2006).</p>
                        <h3>Predisposing factors</h3>
                        <p>Factors that might predispose a woman to a prolonged pregnancy include: obesity, nulliparity, family history of prolonged pregnancy, male fetus, fetal anomaly such as anencephaly (Olesen et al 2006; Biggar et al 2010; Arrowsmith et al 2011; Morken et al 2011; Simpson and Stanley 2011). Cardozo et al (1986) suggest there might be three sub-groups related to a prolonged pregnancy, which include those where the dates are incorrect, those with a normal prolonged gestation where physiological maturity is achieved after 42 weeks and those with correct dates and are functionally mature but who do not go into labour at term. Biggar et al (2010) looking at whether the spontaneous onset of labour is immunologically mediated found the risk of prolonged pregnancy is higher in first pregnancies and subsequently reduces with each following pregnancy, where the father is the same. If there is a different father the risk of prolonged pregnancy is as if it were a first pregnancy. Morken et al (2011) found there was a familial factor in relation to the recurrence of prolonged pregnancy across generations, which involves both the mother and the father. Laursen et al (2004) demonstrate a lower perinatal mortality rate in prolonged pregnancies where the mother has had a previous prolonged pregnancy, which would seem to support a possible genetic influence with a prolonged gestation as a normal variation on human gestation.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-2" class="section-heading">PLAN OF CARE FOR PROLONGED PREGNANCY</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In previous editions of this book the subheading 'Management of prolonged pregnancy' has been used, which may give the impression that the woman has little to contribute to the pregnancy and how it should proceed once she has reached 42 weeks. This implies compliance with the 'choices' given by the healthcare professional rather than active participation in the discussion on the options and choices available which every woman is entitled to (Kirkham et al 2002; Cheyne et al 2012; Stevens and Miller 2012). The concept of 'plan of care' for prolonged pregnancy is perhaps less autocratic, the term implying an approach the purpose of which is for the healthcare professional to work with the woman to determine the most appropriate way forward with the pregnancy in order to ensure the optimum outcome for both mother and baby. In a prolonged pregnancy where there are any obstetric or medical complications the priority in the plan of care should, with maternal consent, follow the practice for the specific complication. If the pregnancy is otherwise low risk, the plan of care can follow an expectant or active approach, and the decision on which approach to take should be based on the woman (and partner) receiving the information on the possible benefits and risks of each to enable her to make an informed decision based on informed choice (NICE 2008a; Jowitt 2012).</p>
                        <p>If a woman chooses the expectant approach the recommendations from NICE (2008a) are increased antenatal surveillance which includes cardiotocography (CTG) at least two times a week, and an ultrasound scan to estimate the maximum amniotic fluid pool depth rather than a more complex approach to antenatal fetal surveillance which includes 'computerised CTG, amniotic fluid index, and assessment of fetal breathing, tone and gross body movements' (NICE 2008a: 279).</p>
                        <p>The use of a cervical membrane sweep (CMS) at 41 weeks' gestation has been shown to increase the spontaneous onset of labour before 42 weeks in some nulliparous and parous women (Mitchell et al 1977; de Miranda et al 2006). The purpose of CMS is to attempt to initiate the onset of labour physiologically thus avoiding the intervention of IOL using prostaglandin, artificial rupture of membranes (ARM) and oxytocin. CMS is designed to separate the membranes from their cervical attachment by introducing the examining fingers into the cervical os and passing them circumferentially around the cervix. The process of detaching the membranes from the decidua results in an increase in the concentration of circulating prostaglandins that may contribute to the initiation of the onset of labour in some individuals (Mitchell et al 1977). Massage of the cervix can be used when the cervical os remains closed and this process may also cause release of local prostaglandin. If after an appropriate time labour has not started spontaneously the process can be repeated. The practice of CMS is not associated with any increase in maternal or neonatal infection although women report more vaginal blood loss and painful contractions in the 24-hour period following the procedure. Simpson and Stanley (2011) state that to avoid IOL in one woman CMS would need to performed for seven women and suggest the benefit is therefore small. However, when one compares this to Stock et al (2012), who state that 1040 women would need to be induced to avoid one perinatal death, whilst leading to seven additional admissions to the special care baby unit, the 'odds' for CMS as a possible means to initiate labour seem extremely favourable.</p>
                        <p>Menticoglou and Hall (2002) argue that 'ritual induction' at 41 weeks is based on flawed evidence and interferes with a 'normal physiologic situation'. Heimstad et al (2007) compared IOL at 41 weeks' gestation with expectant management and found no difference between the two groups with regards to neonatal morbidity or mode of birth. A number of authors cite evidence that where there is an active approach and IOL is undertaken beyond 41 weeks there is a reduction in perinatal mortality (NICE 2008a; Simpson and Stanley 2011; Tun and Tuohy 2011). But as stated above, many authors acknowledge that the 'absolute risk of perinatal death is small' (NICE 2008a; McCarthy and Kenny 2010; Simpson and Stanley 2011; Cheyne et al 2012; Gülmezoglu et al 2012). Oros et al (2012) found that IOL at 41 weeks led to an increase in the length of hospital stay for the mother and an increase in the caesarean section rate.</p>
                        <p>The debate on the management of prolonged pregnancy centres on the disparate evidence with regards to fetal risk and neonatal outcome in terms of perinatal mortality and morbidity, and implementing a policy of 'management' rather than a 'plan of care' is designed to reduce these risks. When looking at the evidence surrounding post dates (40<sup>+0</sup> weeks to 41<sup>+6</sup> weeks) and prolonged pregnancy (42 weeks), what is clear is that nothing is clear. There is a plethora of evidence but much of it is contradictory and much of it is couched in emotive terms. Reference is consistently made to the 'risks of' prolonged pregnancy or the 'risk of' recurrence of prolonged pregnancy, which seems to imply that a poor outcome is inevitable. NICE (2008a) refers to the 'risks of' prolonged pregnancy against the harms and benefits of IOL to avoid prolonged pregnancy. The mechanisms leading to the onset of labour remain largely unknown and the possibility of a prolonged pregnancy being a variation on human gestation within normal parameters should be considered.</p>
                        <p>Like many authors, NICE (2008a) seem to imply, either implicitly or explicitly, there are no benefits to a prolonged pregnancy. Can nature really have got it so wrong? The emphasis appears to be that in human parturition an EDB is calculated, and it is downhill all the way from there; and whilst the EDB remains the focus, the debate and controversy will continue. A number of women will gladly accept, and may even request IOL once they go beyond their EDB and that decision must be respected, but the decision not to have labour induced must also be respected, rather than, as NICE (2008a: 29), suggest 'should' be respected.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The midwife's role</h3>
                        <p>The woman and her partner must be given clear and unbiased information pertaining to the benefits and possible risks of any proposed plan of care to enable the woman to make an informed decision based on informed choice. It is clear from the literature that this is not always the case, and the woman is being directed towards IOL by overemphasizing the risks of prolonged pregnancy whilst downplaying the risks associated with IOL (Gatward et al 2010; Cheyne et al 2012; Stevens and Miller 2012). Whilst the obstetrician will take the lead in such cases, the midwife has a key role in facilitating the woman's right to autonomy by ensuring she has been given clear and unbiased information, that she fully understands the options available to her, and in appropriate cases, acting as the woman's advocate (NMC [Nursing and Midwifery Council] 2012, 2008). Women are put in an unenviable situation at an extremely vulnerable time in their lives and they expect, quite rightly, that the experts will help them to make sense of the choices available to them. The midwife has a duty of care to assist women at this time. It is, however, important to understand that whatever plan of care is put in place in any pregnancy, it is not always possible to avoid a perinatal death.</p>

                                <li>Accurate EDB determined by LMP and early ultrasound reduces the incidence of pregnancies diagnosed as prolonged.</li>
                                <li>The length of gestation in some racial groups must also be considered with regards to a definition of prolonged pregnancy in these groups of women to improve perinatal outcomes.</li>
                                <li>A membrane sweep can be offered from 40 weeks as a means to initiate the onset of spontaneous labour.</li>
                                <li>Where there is any complication in a pregnancy approaching or beyond term the priority in management should follow the practice for the specific complication.</li>
                                <li>Where the woman makes the choice for expectant management she must be informed that any deviations highlighted in antenatal surveillance will necessitate a review of the plan of care and the options available to her.</li>
