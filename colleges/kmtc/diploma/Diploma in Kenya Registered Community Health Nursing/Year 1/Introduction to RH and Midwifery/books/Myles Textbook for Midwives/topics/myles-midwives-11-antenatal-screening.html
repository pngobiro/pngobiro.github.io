                        <p>Screening has now become such a routine part of antenatal care that many women accept this, often with little thought. There is no aspect of the screening programme that does not, however, have the potential to raise huge social, emotional and health issues for pregnant women. The role of the midwife is to guide women through the wealth of tests available, with the best advice possible. This can only be achieved by excellent training and regular updates for all midwives and doctors. Screening develops and moves forward every few months and so vigilance on behalf of us all is needed to ensure we provide the best care.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">SCREENING PRINCIPLES</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Screening of a mother and baby is now a major part of care for all pregnancies. The underlying principles of screening are that the condition being screened for must be important and well understood (i.e. something that makes a difference to health and wellbeing and does more good than harm). Treatment should be available and at a stage where the outcome can be changed. There should be an appropriate and acceptable test that is available to a defined group, making the screening cost effective in reducing poorer health outcomes.</p>
                        <p>The National Screening Committee of the United Kingdom (NSC 2013) defines screening as:</p>
                        <blockquote>a process of identifying apparently healthy people who may be at an increased risk of a disease or condition, they can then be offered information, further tests and appropriate treatment to reduce their risk and/or any complications arising from the disease or condition.</blockquote>
                        <p>Broadly speaking, the conditions that form the national programme for screening in the United Kingdom (UK) meet these criteria. When screening for currently unscreened conditions is considered (e.g. Group B streptococcus), it is weighed against these important criteria.</p>
                        <p>Screening in pregnancy can be divided into looking for conditions in the mother that, if untreated or undetected, could affect her health or the health of the baby or both, and screening for conditions in the fetus that could impact significantly on the health of the baby.</p>
                        <h3>Limitations of screening</h3>
                        <p>Screening has important ethical differences from clinical practice as the health service is targeting apparently healthy people, offering to help individuals to make better informed choices about their health. There are risks involved, however, and it is important that people have realistic expectations of what a screening programme can deliver.</p>
                        <p>While screening has the potential to save lives or improve life through early diagnosis of serious conditions, it is not a foolproof process. Equally, some screening is directed at detecting conditions in the fetus that may lead to significant handicap, and to provide prospective parents with choices regarding continuation or otherwise of the pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>Screening can reduce the risk of developing a condition or its complications but it cannot offer a guarantee of protection. In any screening programme there is a minimum of false-positive results (wrongly reported as having the condition) and false-negative results (wrongly reported as not having the condition). The UK NSC is increasingly presenting screening as risk reduction to emphasize this point.</p>
                        <p>Screening can be an emotive issue. While screening for fetal problems is often considered the most emotionally charged area, it is important to realize that maternal screening can also raise issues and challenges that all health professionals involved in the service need to be equipped to help with. Imagine the emotional journey a mother embarks on when faced with a new diagnosis of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in early pregnancy.</p>
                        <h3>Social and psychological impact of screening investigations</h3>
                        <p>Pregnancy is a profound and life-changing event. During this time the mother has to adapt physically, socially and psychologically to the forthcoming birth of her child. Many women feel more emotional than usual (RaphaelLeff 2005) and may have heightened levels of anxiety (Kleinveld et al 2006; Raynor and England 2010). As Green et al (2004) state, the increasing availability of fetal investigations has been shown to cause women even greater anxiety and stress. Any feelings of excitement and anticipation can quickly change when the mother is introduced to the idea that she is ‘at risk’ of having a baby with a particular problem (Fisher 2006).</p>
                        <p>There is evidence that mothers nearing the end of their reproductive years (with a higher risk of chromosomal abnormality) experience pregnancy in a way that is different to younger women. Older mothers are often more anxious and have fewer feelings of attachment to the fetus at 20 weeks of pregnancy (Berryman and Windridge 1999). Psychologists, sociologists and health professionals now generally accept the finding that high-risk women delay attachment to the fetus until they receive reassuring test results. Rothman (1986) classically termed this the ‘tentative pregnancy’, in a study of women undergoing amniocentesis.</p>
                        <p>Anxiety caused by consideration of possible fetal abnormality may be accompanied by moral or religious dilemmas. Tests that can diagnose chromosomal or genetic abnormalities also carry a risk of procedure-induced miscarriage. Many parents agonize about whether to subject a potentially normal fetus to this risk in order to obtain this information. Parents may then need to consider whether they wish to terminate or continue with an affected pregnancy. Some religious authorities only support prenatal testing so long as the integrity of the mother and fetus are maintained. There are also opposing views about the legitimacy of terminating a pregnancy, even when a serious disorder has been diagnosed. Such dilemmas are an unfortunate but inevitable cost of the choices associated with some fetal investigations.</p>
                        <p>Despite this, there are important advantages to the acquisition of knowledge about the fetus before birth. First, society greatly values the freedom of individuals to choose. People are encouraged to accept some responsibility when making decisions about treatment options, in partnership with healthcare professionals. A second advantage is that reproductive autonomy may be increased. Women can choose for themselves whether they wish to embark upon the lifelong care of a child with special needs. This may be viewed as empowering and as a means of preventing later suffering and hardship for child and family alike.</p>
                        <p>In summary, prenatal testing is a two-edged sword. It enables midwives and doctors to give people choices that were unheard of in previous generations and that may prevent much suffering. However, in some circumstances they actually increase the amount of anxiety and psychological trauma experienced in pregnancy. The long-term effects of such trauma on family dynamics are not currently understood.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">HOW SCREENING IS SET UP AND THE MIDWIFE'S ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>All midwives need to have a broad understanding of screening investigations because they are responsible for offering, interpreting and communicating the results. In the UK, the Midwives Rules and Standards (NMC 2012) state that midwives should work in partnership with women to provide safe, responsive and compassionate care. This implies that the midwife as a key public health agent should enable women to make decisions about their care based on individual needs. Some midwives specialize in discussing complex testing issues with parents and become antenatal screening coordinators.</p>
                        <p>In England from 1 April 2013, 27 Screening and Immunisation Teams will have the responsibility for commissioning and oversight of the UK National Screening Committee (NSC) Antenatal and Newborn Screening programmes. The UK NSC has the overall responsibility for determining these programmes and will ensure the Quality Assurance aspect via Regional Quality Assurance Teams.</p>
                        <p>The UK NSC (2011a) recommends that dedicated screening coordinators oversee the running of screening programmes in every Trust. Screening coordinators also provide specialist advice and ensure that there is a line of referral for women whose needs are not met by routine services. Screening for pregnant women and newborn babies is now such a complex process that the role of screening coordinator has become a full-time role in most services.</p>
                        <p>The UK NSC publishes an extremely helpful timeline for antenatal and newborn screening that will help individuals to see what is required and by when (http:// cpd.screening.nhs.uk/timeline).</p>
                        <p>Each of the individual screening programmes has a number of key performance indicators (KPI) on which the performance of individual National Health Service (NHS) Trusts is measured. The most recent KPI document runs to 45 pages. Overseeing the delivery of the KPIs is the remit of the screening coordinator in each Trust, but it is the hard work of the professionals on the ground that ensures targets are met. As an example, the KPI for screening for hepatitis B states that at least $70\%$ of pregnant women who are hepatitis B positive should be referred and seen by an appropriate specialist within an effective timeframe (6 weeks from identification).</p>
                        <p>The KPI for screening for Down syndrome at between 10 weeks +0 days and 20 weeks +0 days states that in $97\%$ of women there must be sufficient information for the woman to be uniquely identified, and the woman’s correct date of birth, maternal weight, family origin, smoking status and ultrasound dating assessment in millimetres, with associated gestational date and sonographer ID, must be included on the request form.</p>
                        <p>Failsafe procedures are a necessary part of the screening process. In the UK these have been implemented to ensure all screening processes are complete. There are back-up mechanisms in addition to usual care, which ensures if something goes wrong in the screening pathway, processes are in place firstly to identify what is going wrong and secondly to determine what action should follow to ensure a safe outcome.</p>
                        <p>All professionals undertaking screening must be appropriately trained and confident in discussing the risks and benefits of all screening programmes, and in the UK they must adhere to the NSC recommendations and standards.</p>
                        <h3>Documentation</h3>
                        <p>In whatever system is practised, good documentation is vital. The midwife should discuss and offer screening tests, record that the discussion has taken place, that the offer has been made, that the offer has been either accepted or declined. It is very helpful for the whole team engaged in antenatal care to understand from the documentation why screening is declined, if this is the case. Women find being persistently re-offered a screening test that they have declined frustrating and annoying, and simply documenting the discussion properly, rather than ticking a box to indicate that screening was declined, is helpful. This can sometimes also lead on to discussion that can reveal that a woman has not understood the test, the purpose or the benefits, which can help to improve understanding.</p>
                        <p>In the event of decline for infectious diseases screening at the antenatal ‘booking’ appointment, a routine re-offer should be made at about 28 weeks. From a litigation perspective, it is not uncommon for women who have declined screening but experienced a poor outcome to suggest that they were not offered screening or did not understand the purpose of the test on offer. Good documentation and being able to show that written information was given can help in the comprehension of such cases.</p>
                        <h3>Discussion of options</h3>
                        <p>When offering tests, it is necessary for the midwife to present and discuss the options, so that women can make an informed choice that best suits their circumstances and preferences. Midwives are required to discuss options for testing in a manner that enables shared decision-making (Sullivan 2005). This means providing the opportunity to discuss choices with a trained professional who is impartial and supportive as the women make decisions along the screening and diagnostic pathway.</p>
                        <p>There may be mixed feelings about the final decision. Sometimes it is helpful to consider what the mother’s worst-case scenario would be, as that can help to decide the best way forward. The principles for consent for shared decision-making are shown in Box 11.1.</p>
                        <p>Midwives commonly recommend antenatal tests such as infectious disease screening, full blood count or cardiotocograph for reduced fetal movements. However, tests for fetal anomaly require a non-directive approach that enables the mother to make an informed choice (Clarke 1994). Consent must be obtained prior to all tests and this must be documented. Standardized processes allow systems to serve women uniformly and allow good quality of care to be offered to all. In the UK, the NSC (2011a) has published Consent Standards and Guidance for the fetal anomaly screening process which can be used as a model in any healthcare system.</p>

                            <li><strong>Standard 2:</strong> All pregnant women must be offered, at least 24 hours before decisions are made, up-to-date information on fetal anomaly screening based on the current available evidence. The NHS FASP recommends the use of the UK NSC (2012) leaflet entitled Screening tests for you and your baby, available on the NHS FASP website: www.fetalanomaly.screening.nhs.uk. This is available in many different languages and, where needed, resources are available as audio and easy reading.</li>
                            <li><strong>Standard 3:</strong> All eligible pregnant women must be offered ‘testing’ and this offer must be recorded in the woman’s notes and/or hospital electronic records at the antenatal ‘booking’ appointment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Standard 4:</strong> All decisions about the test itself must be recorded in the woman’s hand-held notes and/or in the hospital records.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is important all documentation is dated and signed by the health professional involved.</p>
                        <p>The UK NSC (2011a) guidance is very complete and it is a useful document for all midwives to read. Key aspects are shown in Box 11.2.</p>
                        <p>Assumptions must never be made regarding knowledge about the conditions being screened for. Common misunderstandings are that Down syndrome cannot occur if it has not previously occurred in a family or that a woman is too young to have an affected baby. Many women (and their partners) do not understand that syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection, but that the initial result can show positive if there have been similar non-sexually transmitted infections (such as Yaws).</p>
                        <p>Women who decline first trimester screening should know that they can take up second trimester screening for Down’s syndrome if they change their mind and that they can undergo second trimester screening for fetal anomaly at $18+{^0}$ to $20+{^6}$ weeks.</p>
                        <p>Women who decline initial screening for infections can and should be offered screening later in the pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>Importantly, only the woman has the right to consent to or decline the screening tests. A partner or family member has no right to consent or decline on her behalf. Women can withdraw consent for testing at any time. This decision should be recorded.</p>
                        <h3>The process of consent</h3>
                        <p>Consent is a complex process not a single entity, and requires adequate time. It is important to ensure that the woman has had the time she needs to consider the information and come to a decision. That there has been enough time to ask questions, that she feels comfortable and has involved those she would wish to in reaching a decision. The extent to which women want to involve others is very variable.</p>

                        <p>The amount of information needed will vary between women. Women who do not understand English will require interpreting services and other services might be needed for some women. Not all women will have the capacity to consent. Where capacity is in doubt there are usually local guidelines as to how this should progress forward that are beyond the scope of this chapter.</p>
                        <h3>Issues to consider when presenting information</h3>
                        <p>When discussing tests, it is important to understand the motivations and thought processes of pregnant women. The motivation for testing is often different for mother and practitioner. For the fetal anomaly screening programme, the UK NSC rationale for testing is to identify fetal anomalies; however mothers commonly accept these tests in order to gain reassurance that their fetus is normal (Hunt et al 2005). Mothers often think that fetal anomaly tests such as ultrasound scans are an integral or mandatory part of their antenatal care. They may also be unaware of the reasons for performing the test and this can compound the shock of finding problems or abnormalities (Health Technology Assessment 2000).</p>
                        <p>When women are anxious or under stress, they are less able to remember the information provided (Ingram and Malcarne 1995). Parents may feel vulnerable and less able to ask questions. This may lead to dissatisfaction with the quality of communications with health carers. Since an unborn fetus is something of an enigma to parents, this may increase anxiety and sensitivity to real or imaginary cues. For example, professionals practising non-directive counselling may be perceived as evasive and as concealing bad news. One particular aspect of counselling that has been criticized by parents is the portrayal of risk estimates (Al-Jader et al 2000).</p>
                        <p>There is much evidence that people do not make consistent decisions about undertaking tests in pregnancy on the basis of the risk information received. For instance, a mother with a risk of Down syndrome of $1:150$ may perceive herself to be at a very high risk and may request amniocentesis. However, others may view that same risk as very low. The phenomenon of how parents interpret risk information is not fully understood, although it is clear that personal circumstances, preferences and beliefs are an integral part of this process. For this reason, it is vital that, with any screening, the midwife begins a consultation by investigating how much the mother knows about the condition being tested for, and what she already knows about the test risks, benefits and the consequences of results.</p>
                        <p>There are also common biases in the way people interpret risk information. The midwife should be aware of these in order to help parents choose the most appropriate course of action. For example, people tend to view an event as more likely if they can easily imagine or recall instances of it. This means that a mother whose friend or neighbour has a baby with Down syndrome may be sensitized to this possibility and overestimate the chances of it happening to her. Mothers who work with infirm people, or those with a disability, are most likely to seek prenatal diagnosis (Sjögren 1996). Perhaps these mothers are easily able to imagine the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with special needs. This common bias in risk perception is important because it means that some mothers may not easily be reassured by reiteration of the fact that the risk of a problem may be comparatively rare.</p>
                        <h3>Explaining risk</h3>
                        <p>The way in which the midwife tells a mother about risk will also greatly influence how that risk is perceived. For example, a mother who is told that her risk of a particular condition is 1 in 10 may be more alarmed than if she had been informed that there was a $90\%$ chance of normality. or 9 out of 10 babies will not be affected by the condition. This is known as the ‘framing’ effect (Kessler and Levine 1987).</p>
                        <p>People vary considerably in the ways that they consider and understand risk, so it is important that this information is presented in a variety of ways using appropriate language. The UK NSC (2011a) recommend the use of the word ‘chance’ rather than ‘risk’ and that the chance of the outcome (which for antenatal screening now mainly relates to screening for Down syndrome) be given as a percentage as well as a ratio 1 in x. As such, a midwife discussing a 1 in 100 chance of a disorder should also point out the fact that $99\%$ or 99 out of 100 similar people will not experience that disorder. This may help people cope when considering tests or when anxiously awaiting results.</p>
                        <p>There are other general considerations to take into account when providing information (Hunter 1994), as delineated in Box 11.3.</p>
                        <p>If a test is undertaken in pregnancy, it is good practice to ensure that the woman is clear about how, when and from whom she will be able to obtain the result. If possible, there should be some options available.</p>
                        <p>The UK NSC (2011a) is clear that the person ordering the test has the responsibility to ensure that the test is properly completed and that the woman is informed of the result. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE 2008) antenatal care guidelines state that every woman should have the results of all of their screening tests recorded in their hand-held notes within 14 days or at the 16 week antenatal appointment. It therefore requires each midwifery team to have a process for the management of tracking tests performed and the results, a means to inform women, a process of fail-safe so that when, as will inevitably happen, a test is not performed or sample not processed because in some way the process failed, this is recognized in a timely enough fashion for the test to be repeated, and that the results are recorded in the woman’s hand-held notes.</p>
                        <p>On a logistical front, this is no mean task. Failings in the screening system are identified as serious incidents and there is a formal process in the UK that must be undertaken when failings are identified. In practice, the majority of women who fall between stools are those whose pregnancies do not follow the routine process, for instance those who move or whose pregnancy does not continue. These women, as much as anyone else, still should be informed of results that are important to them, such as the results of infection screening.</p>

                        <p>Antenatal screening tests are broadly divided into those that are looking for a problem in the mother that could affect the fetus, such as an infection, the presence of a redcell antibody, or a particular haemoglobin variant, which if passed on by both parents could cause an issue, or those looking directly for a problem in the fetus.</p>

                        <p>Population screening of the fetus (i.e. that offered to everyone) is now directed at two areas: defining the risk of a baby having Down syndrome (trisomy 21), and the detection of specific abnormalities.</p>
                        <h3>Screening for Down syndrome</h3>
                        <p>Down syndrome is the most common cause of severe learning difficulty in children. In the absence of antenatal screening, around 1 in 700 births would be affected (Kennard et al 1995). While some children with Down syndrome learn literacy skills and lead semi-independent lives, others remain completely dependent. Around one in three of these babies are born with a serious heart defect. The average life expectancy is about 60 years, although most people develop pathological changes in the brain associated with Alzheimer’s disease) after the age of 40 (Kingston 2002).</p>
                        <p>Screening for Down syndrome has been driven by both health economics and maternal choice. That is not to say, however, that all mothers wish to be screened, or would act to end a pregnancy if they knew they were carrying an affected fetus. Uptake rates for screening vary depending on the population being screened. Some mothers will chose screening despite knowing that they would not act on a result that gave them a high chance. Interestingly, the single largest factor in deciding whether to take further tests after a high chance result is the degree of magnitude of the change in risk. In other words, a mother who has a pre-test chance (based on age alone) of 1 in 100 ($1\%$), who has a screening result of 1 in 120 ($0.83\%$) will be less likely to wish to proceed to further testing than a woman who has a pre-test chance of 1 in 1000, who then receives a result of 1 in 120 chance, even though both are at equal risk of giving birth to a baby with Down syndrome.</p>
                        <p>The national screening programme for Down syndrome in the UK comprises the offer of one of two tests. The gestational age window for a combined test starts from $10+{^0}$ weeks to $14+{^1}$ weeks in pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>combined test</strong> comprises measurement of the crown-rump length (CRL) (Fig. 11.1) to estimate fetal gestational age (dating scan), measurement of the nuchal translucency (NT) space at the back of the fetal neck (Fig. 11.2) and maternal blood to measure the serum markers of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and human chorionic gonadotrophin hormone (hCG).</p>
                        <p>Using this test, $90\%$ of fetuses affected with Down syndrome would be expected to fall into the high-chance category (a chance of 1 in 150 or more) (the detection rate) with $2\%$ of women carrying unaffected babies having a chance of 1 in 150 or higher (a screen positive rate of $2\%$).</p>
                        <p>The <strong>quadruple test</strong> window starts from $14+{^2}$ weeks to $20+{^0}$ weeks. A maternal blood sample is required for the analysis of hCG, alpha-fetoprotein (aFP), unconjugated oestriol (uE3) and inhibin-A.</p>
                        <p>As stated in the UK NSC (2011b), Model of Best Practice 2011-2014, this test has a lesser detection rate of $75\%$ and a screen positive rate of less than $3\%$, but has been retained because there will always be women who book too late in pregnancy for combined testing (about $15\%$ of the pregnant population) and wish to have screening. Women presenting after 20 weeks are offered ultrasound for abnormality screening, which will occasionally detect an abnormality that increases the chance that the baby has Down syndrome, but there is no population screening available at this gestation.</p>
                        <p>Women need to decide as early in their pregnancy as possible if they wish to undertake screening for Down syndrome as earlier testing is superior, and ease of access is important in facilitating testing.</p>
                        <p>In counselling, women need to be clear that neither screening test gives a guarantee of normality. With combined screening $10\%$ of affected babies will be missed and with quadruple testing $25\%$ of Down babies will be missed. This is termed the false-negative rate.</p>

                        <h4>Diagnostic testing for Down syndrome</h4>
                        <p>In the UK, women who receive a result of 1 in 150 or higher from either first or second trimester screening or those women who have previously had a chromosomal abnormality or who carry a genetic disorder will be offered diagnostic testing, i.e. CVS or amniocentesis. The NHS no longer provides diagnostic testing for maternal age alone or following a low chance screening test result, although privately available services are usually easy to access.</p>
                        <p><strong>CVS</strong> can be performed from 11 weeks of pregnancy. Usually the procedure is carried out transabdominally (Fig. 11.3), though occasionally a transcervical (TC) route is needed. The miscarriage rate is often quoted as $2-3\%$ but in most fetal medicine units the procedure-related loss rate is closer to $1\%$ (though TC sampling risks are higher). A provisional result is usually issued on a direct preparation at 1-2 days. If this result shows no evidence of an extra chromosome 21 it can be taken as $99.9\%$ certain that the fetus does not have trisomy 21. However, as confined placental mosaicism can rarely occur, which gives a false-negative result, at this stage definite confirmation cannot be made until the culture result is available at 14-21 days.</p>
                        <p><strong>Amniocentesis</strong> can be performed after 15 weeks (Fig. 11.4). The procedure-related loss rate is usually no higher than $1\%$ and in many units is closer to $0.5\%$. Rapid testing using polymerase chain reaction or fluorescent in situ hybridization can usually mean that a result for trisomy 21 (and usually 13 and 18) is available in 2-3 working days.</p>
                        <p>A diagnosis of Down syndrome can be accurately made using CVS or amniocentesis, but it cannot give certainty as to the severity of the disorder or the quality of life of a particular individual. Responses to a diagnosis will vary, according to cultural, social, moral and religious beliefs.</p>

                        <h3>Screening for haemoglobinopathies</h3>
                        <p>The NHS NSC antenatal and newborn screening programmes include antenatal screening for fetal haemoglobinopathies. This should be linked with the newborn bloodspot screening programme, which tests for sickle cell disease. Linking results of parents and babies increases health professionals access to families with genetic disorders, allowing the results to be available throughout the individual’s life, reducing repeat screening. Haemoglobinopathies are inherited disorders of haemoglobin and are more prevalent in certain racial groups. Antenatal screening identifies about 22,000 carriers of sickle cell disease and thalassaemia in the UK every year (NHS Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Programme 2011).</p>
                        <p>Currently, in the UK, antenatal screening for haemoglobinopathy is based on population prevalence. High prevalence areas have universal screening (offer all pregnant women electrophoresis screening for haemoglobin variants and thalassaemia trait). Low prevalence areas use the national Family Origin Questionnaire (FOQ) to determine genetic ancestry for the last two generations (or more if possible). All areas collect information on the FOQ in their maternity population. This information is needed by laboratories to help interpret screening results.</p>
                        <p>In low-prevalence areas, women with genetic ancestry that includes high-risk racial groups are offered electrophoresis testing. If the mother is found to be a haemoglobinopathy carrier, partner testing is then recommended and should be offered soon after the result is available. Genetic ancestry is also important when interpreting screening results. It is important to establish maternal iron levels when carrier status for thalassaemia is suspected, since iron deficiency can give rise to similar red cell appearances.(e.g. alpha thalassaemia). Most haemoglobinopathies are recessively inherited, so the fetus would have a 1 in 4 chance of inheriting the disorder and a 1 in 2 chance of being a carrier.</p>
                        <h4>Pre-test information for antenatal haemoglobinopathy screening</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In early pregnancy, information should be supplied. In the UK this means that all women should receive the NSC (2012) information booklet Screening tests for you and your baby as early in pregnancy as possible.</li>
                            <li>The information should be provided in an appropriate language or format.</li>
                            <li>Testing should be performed as early in pregnancy as possible, ideally at $8-10$ weeks’ gestation, as screening decisions are often gestation-dependent.</li>
                            <li>Women who book late in pregnancy should be offered haemoglobinopathy screening in the same way at the first point of contact. Options for ending an affected pregnancy may be limited.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Where both parents are identified as carriers, they need urgent counselling. In the UK parents are referred urgently to the PEGASUS (Professional Education for Genetic Assessment and Screening) trained midwife for specialist counselling or to the combined obstetric/haematology clinic at the booking hospital. Diagnostic testing by CVS or amniocentesis should be offered.</p>
                        <p>Where paternity is unknown, the father of the baby is unavailable or declines testing, the woman should be offered a counselling appointment to calculate the possibility of the baby having an inherited haemoglobin disorder and an offer of diagnostic testing made if the risks warrant this. All women will be offered neonatal blood spot screening at 5 days, which will detect sickle cell disease (but not other haemoglobinopathies).</p>
                        <h3>Ultrasonography for fetal screening</h3>
                        <p>In the UK, the NSC (2011a) standards are that all pregnant women should be offered two routine ultrasound scans. These include an early pregnancy scan (usually timed to be able to perform the NT measurement if requested) and an 18-20 week fetal anomaly screening scan. Ultrasound works by transmitting sound at a very high frequency, via a probe, in a narrow beam. When the sound waves enter the body and encounter a structure, some of that sound is reflected back. The amount of sound reflected varies according to the type of tissue encountered; for example, fluid does not reflect sound and appears as a black image. Conversely, bone reflects a considerable amount of sound and appears as white or echogenic. Many structures appear as different shades of grey. Generally, pictures are transmitted in ‘real time’, which enables fetal movements to be seen.</p>
                        <h4>Safety aspects of ultrasound</h4>
                        <p>Ultrasound has been used as a diagnostic imaging tool since the 1950s, so we are now into the third generation of scanned babies. It seems reasonable to assume that any major adverse effects of this technology would have become apparent before now. However, modern machines have higher resolutions and indications for ultrasound scanning have greatly increased. This means that levels of exposure to ultrasound have increased in pregnancy. Although the technology is considered safe, it should be used with respect and only when there is good indication, and care should be taken to limit exposure time and the thermal indices should be controlled (European Committee of Medical Ultrasound Safety 2008). Ultrasound is a diagnostic tool, but diagnosis can only be as reliable as the expertise of the operator and the quality of the machine. As Wood (2000) states, abnormalities may be missed or incorrectly diagnosed if the operator is inexperienced or inadequately trained.</p>
                        <h4>Women’s experiences of ultrasound</h4>
                        <p>In general, women experience ultrasound as a pleasurable opportunity to have visual access to their unborn baby (Sandelowski 1994). Indeed, ultrasound scans have been shown to increase psychological attachment to the fetus (Sedgman et al 2006). Parents have a profound curiosity about their baby and a scan can turn something nebulous into something that seems much more real as a living individual (Furness 1990). This can be particularly important for a woman’s partner and family, who do not have the immediate physical experience of the pregnancy. Women tend to regard their scan as providing a general view of fetal well-being: the fact that the fetus is alive, growing and developing. However, this reassurance is temporary and begins to wear off after a few weeks (Clement et al 1998). Mothers may then seek other forms of reassurance (e.g. monitoring fetal movements, auscultation of the fetal heartbeat). This initial reassurance may also create an enthusiasm for scans when there is no clinical indication.</p>
                        <p>Scans may also cause considerable anxiety, however, particularly if there is a suspected or actual problem with the fetus. There is evidence to suggest that women who miscarry after visualization of the fetus on scan may feel a heightened sense of anguish because the fetus seemed more real. This may also be the case for parents considering termination of pregnancy on the grounds of fetal abnormality. However, others may view their scan as a treasured memory of the baby they lost (Black 1992).</p>
                        <p>The identification of fetal abnormality in the antenatal period has differing psychological effects for parents when the pregnancy is to continue. Some parents have reported feeling grateful that they were able to prepare for the birth of a child with a disability (Chitty et al 1996). However, others have reported feelings of wishing they had not known about their child’s problems before birth because this created a powerful image of the fetus as a ‘monster’. Some parents reported this to be far worse than the reality of caring for the baby after birth (Turner 1994). It is necessary for midwives to be mindful of the powerful psychological effects ultrasound scans have on pregnant women and their families, if sensitive and appropriate care is to be given at this potentially distressing time.</p>
                        <h4>The midwife’s role concerning ultrasound scans</h4>
                        <p>As for all procedures, mothers should be fully informed about the purpose of the scan. Information should be given about which conditions are being checked for and which problems the scan would be unable to detect. Because of the pleasurable aspect of seeing the fetus, ultrasound scans have traditionally been tests that mothers undertake willingly, without prior discussion and consideration of potential consequences. Ultrasound screening for fetal abnormality is a screening test and as such women should be counselled as to the purpose, choices and pitfalls of screening so that they can decide whether or not they wish to undergo a procedure that may bring unwelcome news. Women should be aware that ultrasound scans are optional and not an inevitable part of their care.</p>
                        <p>Women should also understand that a normal ‘scan’ does not guarantee normality in the baby. Box 11.4 shows the detection rates for the commonly assessed abnormalities, which should be shared with women.</p>
                        <p>There is evidence that, although some mothers may find this information disturbing, most feel that this is outweighed by the positive aspects of seeing the baby and gaining reassurance (Oliver et al 1996). Indeed, extra information about the purpose of the scan has been shown to increase women’s understanding and satisfaction with the amount of information received, while the proportion of women accepting a scan ($99\%$) appears to remain unchanged (Thornton et al 1995).</p>
                        <p>The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG 2000) recommends that, wherever scans are performed, a midwife or counsellor with a particular interest or expertise in the area should be available to discuss difficult news. All women with a suspected or confirmed fetal anomaly should be seen by an obstetric ultrasound specialist within three working days of the referral being made or seen by a fetal medicine unit within five working days of the referral being made (NSC 2011a: Standard 4). Effective multidisciplinary team working and communication are therefore essential. It is also good practice for the midwife to liaise with the primary healthcare team, who would normally carry out the majority of antenatal care. With the increasing use of client-held records, mothers may have more opportunity to scrutinize the written results of their scan. Midwives may increasingly be called upon to explain and discuss these findings, both in hospital and in the community setting.</p>

                        </aside>
                        <h4>First trimester pregnancy scans</h4>
                        <p>All women should be offered a first trimester scan. The purpose of this is to establish:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>that the pregnancy is viable and intrauterine (not ectopic);</li>
                            <li>to measure the NT if the gestation is appropriate and screening for Down syndrome is accepted;</li>
                            <li>to accurately define the gestational age;</li>
                            <li>to determine fetal number (and chorionicity or amnionicity in multiple pregnancies);</li>
                            <li>to detect gross fetal abnormalities, such as anencephaly (absence of the cranial vault).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Early ultrasound scanning is beneficial, in reducing the need to induce labour for post-maturity (Whitworth et al 2010). A gestation sac can usually be visualized from 5 weeks’ gestation and a small embryo from 6 weeks. Until 13 weeks, gestational age can be accurately assessed by CRL measurement (the length of the fetus from the top of the head to the end of the sacrum). Care must be taken to ensure that the fetus is not flexed at the time of measurement. Mothers are asked to attend with a full bladder, since this aids visualization of the uterus at an early gestation.</p>
                        <h4>Dealing with increased nuchal translucency</h4>
                        <p>A nuchal translucency of >3.5 mm occurs in about $1\%$ of pregnancies (see Fig. 11.2). It is considered to be the threshold definition of an increased NT above which the risk of other (non-chromosomal) abnormalities increases. Increased NT is associated with a risk of chromosomal abnormalities and also with other structural (mainly cardiac) abnormalities (>10% risk), genetic syndromes and an increased fetal loss rate. Where an increased NT is seen regardless of whether screening for Down syndrome was declined, the potential for problems to be present must be discussed and ideally referral to specialist scanning and counselling arranged. In the presence of a normal karyotype, if no structural abnormalities are found the UK NSC (2011a) states that the incidence of adverse outcome is not increased, but also acknowledges that the chance of developmental delay is $2-4\%$.</p>
                        <p>Where diagnostic testing and 18-20 weeks ultrasound is normal it is reasonable to be optimistic regarding outcome, but it is worth recognizing that parents will carry the anxiety of uncertainty with them through and even beyond the end of the pregnancy and will often require a lot of support.</p>
                        <h4>Second trimester ultrasound scans</h4>
                        <p>After $13+{^6}$ weeks of pregnancy, gestational age is primarily assessed using the head circumference (HC).</p>
                        <h5>The detailed fetal anomaly screening scan</h5>
                        <p>This scan is usually performed at $18-20+{^6}$ weeks of pregnancy. The purpose of this scan is to reassure the mother that the fetus has no obvious structural anomalies that fall into the following categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>anomalies that are incompatible with life;</li>
                            <li>anomalies that are associated with significant morbidity and long-term disability;</li>
                            <li>anomalies that may benefit from intrauterine therapy;</li>
                            <li>anomalies that may require postnatal treatment or investigation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Detection rates should be in line with those outlined earlier. Technical difficulties, such as fetal position, multiple pregnancy, fibroids or maternal obesity may mean that a second scan before 23 weeks is offered. Some structural problems do not have sonographic signs that would be visible at this gestation or even at all. Anal atresia does not have a clear appearance on ultrasound; hydrocephalus and other bowel obstructions may not appear until later in pregnancy. Diagnosis may therefore not be possible. The UK NSC has defined which structures should be examined (Box 11.5) and which images should be stored as part of the woman’s record.</p>
                        <p>Some features on ultrasound may be seen that increase the risk of another problem such as Down syndrome. An increased skin fold measurement of >6 mm at the level of the nuchal fold (a different entity to the nuchal translucency) should be noted as there is an associated increase in the risk for Down syndrome of at least 10 -fold. Mild cerebral ventriculomegaly should be noted as there is again an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities of about $10\%$. Echogenic bowel can be seen in cases of cystic fibrosis, fetal infection, and if associated with growth restriction and mild renal pelvis dilatation (>7 mm) can progress to significant hydronephrosis.</p>
                        <p>What used to be termed ‘soft markers’ are no longer considered to have any significant impact on the risk of chromosomal abnormality in isolation or combination, and are termed ‘normal variants’ and are therefore not usually reported (choroid plexus cysts, two-vessel cord, dilated cisterna magna, echogenic cardiac focus).</p>

                        <h5>Advantages and disadvantages of fetal anomaly scans</h5>
                        <p>Provided the sonographer has sufficient expertise, many lethal or severely disabling conditions can be detected during the $18-20$ week scan. There is also an increase in first trimester diagnosis. Although this means that parents may be faced with difficult and unexpected decisions, it allows parents the choices that would be denied without this knowledge. Furthermore, many parents are offered reassurance that no obvious abnormalities were seen. For neonates requiring early surgical or paediatric interventions, prior knowledge of the abnormality allows a plan of care to be evolved in advance of the birth. The mother can then give birth in a unit with appropriate facilities. This has been shown to reduce morbidity in cases of gastroschisis (an abdominal wall defect, adjacent to the umbilicus, allowing the intestines and other abdominal organs to protrude outside the body), cardiac abnormalities and intestinal obstruction (Romero et al 1989). For parents who choose to continue the pregnancy knowing that the baby has a life-limiting condition, careful planning regarding place of birth, care of the baby after birth and multidisciplinary support can be provided.</p>
                        <p>In summary, the 18-20 week scan appears to confer psychological and health improvement benefits in some cases, but also has the capacity to cause great anxiety and distress. Care must be taken to ensure that parents are fully informed of the purpose, benefits and limitations of ultrasound scans before they consent to this procedure.</p>
                        <h3>New and emerging technologies</h3>
                        <h4>Fetal imaging techniques</h4>
                        <p>Ultrasound scans in pregnancy have been discussed at length in this chapter, since they are important fetal investigations. Women generally see two-dimensional (2-D) images of their unborn baby. However, there is a growing market for three-dimensional ultrasound imaging (3-D). As such, multiple images are stored digitally and then shaded to produce life-like pictures. This technique can assist the diagnosis of surface structural anomalies, such as cleft lip and spina bifida, and improvements are being seen in cardiac and neurological scanning (Sandelowski 1994; Sedgman et al 2006).</p>
                        <p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has also been applied in the examination of the fetus over the last two decades. This technique has not been widely applied because ultrasound can give similar diagnostic information at a lower cost. However, MRI has a contribution to make, particularly when examining the brain. There is evidence that this may provide additional information and change the counselling and management for a significant number of pregnancies where brain abnormalities are suspected (Glenn and Barkovich 2006). A further application is that MRI offers an alternative to postmortem following termination or perinatal death. This can offer information to parents who decline postmortem because of its invasive nature (Brookes and Hall-Craggs 1997). MRI imaging has been used to refine the diagnosis of many other conditions including diaphragmatic hernias and sacrococcygeal teratomas (Kumar and O’Brien 2004).</p>
                        <h4>Free fetal DNA</h4>
                        <p>Much work is now being done on the technology that identifies free fetal DNA in the maternal circulation. Already it is possible to identify with great (though not $100\%$) accuracy, fetal sex, blood group and some genetic disorders. Before long RAPID (Reliable Accurate Prenatal non-Invasive Diagnosis) study will report the results of the research into testing for Down syndrome using this technology. Already a test is available privately in the United States. This will undoubtedly increase the true-positive rate and decrease the false-negative rate for screening for Down syndrome, which will become available as a blood test. Confirmatory testing will still be required, but fewer tests will be needed. Free fetal DNA is now routinely used to determine fetal blood group (see below).</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The rationale for screening a mother is to detect conditions that are amenable to treatment and will have potential health benefits for her and her baby. In the main, in pregnancy, screening is focused on those that carry improved outcomes for the baby.</p>
                        <h3>Infectious diseases</h3>
                        <p>In the UK the NSC programme for screening of infectious diseases in pregnancy recommends that all pregnant women are screened for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HIV</li>
                            <li>syphilis</li>
                            <li>hepatitis B (HBV)</li>
                            <li>rubella.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The infectious diseases screened for meet the screening criteria in that they are important and intervention can reduce harm. Rubella screening cannot reduce the risk if a mother develops the illness but allows immunization in the future to reduce risk.</p>
                        <h4>Human immune deficiency virus (HIV)</h4>
                        <p>Knowledge and adequate management of women with HIV can reduce mother to child transfer to less than $1\%$ and improve maternal health. Screening should be offered at booking and again later in pregnancy in women at high risk (e.g. women who are paid for sex, women who have an untested partner from an area of high prevalence, intravenous drug users). Women who decline screening should also be re-offered testing later in pregnancy.</p>
                        <h4>Hepatitis B (HB)</h4>
                        <p>Adequate immunization programmes for infants at risk of vertical transmission of HBV can reduce infant infection rates by $90\%$ and improvements in maternal health can be made.</p>
                        <p>Referral to a specialist is required for women who are found to be hepatitis B positive. Establishing the neonatal and maternal risk will be determined by testing of antibody and antigen status and viral DNA levels. Occasionally hepatitis B can reactivate in pregnancy and knowledge of status can aid management of the pregnant mother.</p>
                        <h4>Syphilis</h4>
                        <p>Syphilis used to be a rare infection in the UK, but the incidence is now inexorably rising. Treatment of syphilis can prevent pregnancy loss plus congenital syphilis, and prevent long-term problems for the mother. A positive screening result does not distinguish between syphilis and other treponemal infections, so specialist input is required if the initial screening test is positive.</p>
                        <p>In all three of the above infections, knowledge of infection can prevent unwitting infection of sexual partners.</p>
                        <h4>Rubella</h4>
                        <p>Screening for susceptibility to rubella aims to identify the $3\%$ of women who are susceptible, to counsel about avoidance of potentially infected individuals during pregnancy and to offer postnatal vaccination.</p>
                        <p>For the above infections, testing in early pregnancy is recommended. Written information should be provided at least 24 hours prior to decisions being made. In order for the woman to make an informed choice, the midwife should discuss the following points:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The infections that are screened for, their routes of transmission and the implications of a positive test.</li>
                            <li>The benefits, to both mother and baby, to be gained from the identification and management of those with positive results.</li>
                            <li>The results procedure, including the feedback of results and the possibility of a false- negative or false-positive result.</li>
                            <li>All pregnant women should be advised that if they develop, or are exposed to, a rash during the pregnancy they should seek professional advice.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>That the offer was made and the response to the offer should be documented with the date. Women who initially decline should be re-offered testing at a later date; usually it is best to do this before 28 weeks. If testing is declined it is good practice to enquire why and to explore and document the reasons. Women who book late or who arrive untested in labour can be urgently screened.</p>
                        <p>Women with a positive result for syphilis, HIV or HBV should be seen and counselled as soon as possible and within 10 days in the UK. Appropriate referrals should then be made to ensure that the correct care pathway is inducted.</p>
                        <p>Screening for infectious diseases in pregnancy can be enormously challenging for the mother and for the midwife. The cultural and social stigma that is still attached to a diagnosis of HIV means that some women will be reluctant to consider testing or may be devastated when a positive test is confirmed. Issues such as partner testing need sensitive exploration and should be undertaken by the wider multidisciplinary team that will care for these women. The midwife needs to have enough knowledge to understand the disease, the process following a positive test and the ability to answer questions or direct women to the answers.</p>
                        <h3>New screening</h3>
                        <p>In the UK screening does not exist on a population basis yet for Group B Streptococcus (GBS). GBS is carried in the genital tract and gut of many healthy people (between 10 and $40 \%$). It is estimated that about $25\%$ of pregnant women in the UK carry GBS. In the UK GBS is either detected opportunistically or by screening for high-risk situations, such as after premature or prolonged rupture of the membranes. Using this strategy 0.5/1000 babies are affected by early onset GBS disease, a disease that can cause severe problems for these babies, including meningitis and death. New work on why only some babies are affected has focused on the ability of the mother to pass on GBS antibodies, but this has not been able to identify a very high-risk group that could be effectively targeted.</p>
                        <p>In the United States screening is offered by vaginal swabs at $35-37$ weeks. However, the risk of GBS in the United States is considerably higher, again for reasons that are not entirely understood.</p>
                        <p>The NSC (UK) is consulting on whether to include GBS screening within the programme for the future. Important considerations are the effect of antibiotics on as many as $25\%$ of the pregnant population, weighed against the harm to about 340 babies per year.</p>
                        <h3>Mid-stream urine testing</h3>
                        <p>Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria is recommended as in pregnancy progression to pyelonephritis can occur in up to $25\%$ of women. Pyelonephritis can be life-threatening and can lead to miscarriage and premature labour. Treatment is simple and effective with appropriately targeted antibiotics.</p>
                        <h3>Screening for anaemia</h3>
                        <p>Anaemia is one of the commonest complications of pregnancy. The most common reason for iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy is the increased demands of the fetus for iron. Risk factors for the development of iron deficiency in pregnancy include iron deficiency prior to pregnancy, hyperemesis, vegetarian or vegan diet, multiple pregnancies, pregnancy recurring after a short interval and blood loss.</p>
                        <p>Pregnant women should be offered screening for anaemia in early in pregnancy and at 28 weeks. This allows enough time for treatment if anaemia is detected.</p>
                        <p>Haemoglobin levels outside the normal UK range for pregnancy (that is, $11 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ at first contact and $10.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ at 28 weeks) should be investigated. Provided there are no unusual features to suggest another cause for the anaemia, treatment with iron can be started and a blood test for serum ferritin sent at the same time to confirm iron stores are low. The woman should be asked if she is known to have a haemoglobinopathy. These women should be directly referred to an Obstetric Haematology clinic for assessment.</p>
                        <h3>Screening for red cell antibodies</h3>
                        <p>All pregnant women should be offered antenatal testing to assess ABO and rhesus status and to look for red cell antibodies. There will usually be relevant national guidelines, which will specify the intervals at which this should take place. This will vary depending on the woman’s Rhesus (Rh) type and whether any red cell antibodies are detected.</p>
                        <p>Red cell antibodies are antibodies against red cell antigens, and the relevance to pregnancy will vary depending on the type and level of the circulating antibody. Some antibodies occur naturally, without any sensitising event, but most of the important ones require a sensitising event such as a previous pregnancy or transfusion. Antibodies to the ABO system tend to be naturally occurring, as does anti-E.</p>
                        <p>Once an antibody has been identified it will be relevant to understand the issues for both the mother and baby.</p>
                        <p>For the mother with any red-cell antibody the major issue is related to increased difficulty in crossmatching blood. Women with antibodies will not be able to undergo rapid electronic crossmatching and therefore for women at any increased risk in labour of haemorrhage, crossmatching in the early stages or before planned birth may be prudent.</p>
                        <p>For the fetus, red-cell antibodies are of significance as IgG antibodies can cross the placenta. If the fetal red blood cells carry the antigen the antibody is directed against they will be destroyed. This can lead to fetal anaemia and in severe cases cause fetal hydrops. Jaundice and kernicterus (brain damage caused by very high unconjugated bilirubin levels) in the neonatal period are the major neonatal risks. Routine antibody testing in pregnancy aims to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>identify Rhesus-negative women who will be eligible for anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis</li>
                            <li>identify women who are difficult to crossmatch so that steps can be taken to minimize risk</li>
                            <li>identify women with antibodies that put the fetus at risk of haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The UK recommends that all women should be tested at booking and again at 28 weeks’ gestation (NICE 2008).</p>
                        <p>There are many red cell antibodies and it is useful to understand which ones are important causes of HDN.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Antibodies to the Rhesus antigens are the most common to cause problems.</li>
                            <li>Rhesus D antibodies are the principle cause of severe HDN.</li>
                            <li>Rhesus c can cause HDN, especially if antibodies to Rhesus E are also present</li>
                            <li>Rarely antibodies to Rhesus E, e, C and CW can cause HDN.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Antibodies to non-Rhesus antigens can also cause HND. Anti-K (Kell) antibodies are an important cause of severe HDN. These antibodies not only destroy the fetal red cells, but inhibit production in the bone marrow, exacerbating any developing anaemia.</p>
                        <p>Other antibodies known to cause HDN less commonly include anti Fya (Duffy), anti Jka (Kidd) and anti S.</p>
                        <p>Antibodies to the ABO system may be detected on routine testing. In general these occur in Group O women and are naturally occurring anti-A and anti-B antibodies. Because these antibodies are Ig M antibodies they do not cross the placenta and do not harm the fetus. Occasionally some group O women produce IgG antibodies when carrying group A or B infants. These IgG antibodies can cross the placenta and cause HDN, but this tends to be mild.</p>
                        <h4>How the results are presented</h4>
                        <p>Antibody levels are either given as the actual measured amount or as the dilution achieved before there is insufficient antibody to cause red cell clumping.</p>
                        <p>Rh-D and Rh-c are always measured and the result will be given in iu/ml; hence the higher the result the worse the effects are likely to be.</p>
                        <p>Other antibody levels are expressed as titres. A titre of $1: 2$ means that after a single dilution there was no clumping of the red cells. This would be a low level of antibody. A titre of $1: 16$ states that there were four dilutions before the antibody was too weak to clump cells, implying a much higher level of antibody. It is useful to understand that a jump from $1: 2$ to $1: 4$ is a single dilution, as is a jump from $1: 16$ to $1: 32$.</p>
                        <h4>What parents need to know</h4>
                        <p>Parents need to understand the purpose of blood group and red cell antibody screening, what is being tested for and what the test involves. This will involve discussion about the nature and effects of red cell antibodies, how and when test results will be available and the meaning of the results.</p>
                        <h4>Management when an antibody is detected</h4>
                        <p>When an antibody is detected it is important that the relevance of this is discussed with the mother. The discussion should cover the potential for difficulties in crossmatching blood and the potential for fetal or neonatal problems. If significant antibody titres are found management needs to be discussed, including the need for surveillance for fetal anaemia and the possibility of intrauterine transfusion - this would usually be done by the obstetrician managing the pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>Surveillance will depend on the type of antibody found; for some antibodies, the titre (level) of the antibody; and the gestation of pregnancy at which it is discovered.</p>
                        <p>Discussion with the consultant team is usually needed to define the steps that need to be taken.</p>
                        <p>When an antibody is detected that may cause HDN the next steps will usually be:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Referral for discussion with an appropriate consultant/haematology team.</li>
                            <li>Partner testing. This is to determine the potential for fetal risk. Only a fetus that is antigen positive for the antibody found can be at risk. This means that, for instance, if a woman has anti-D antibodies and a Rh-D-positive partner there will be a $50-100\%$ risk of producing a baby who is Rh-D-positive, depending on whether the partner carries one or two Rh-D-positive genes. It is imperative that the woman understands the importance of partner testing, the need to be honest if there can be any doubt regarding paternity (and for this to be asked about sensitively, without the partner being present). Beware with IVF pregnancies also. Remember to ask whether there has been egg donation, as in these cases it may be the maternal genetic complement that differs and cases of HDN have occurred where this vital fact has not been ascertained.</li>
                            <li>Free fetal DNA testing. Where the fetus is potentially at risk because the partner is positive for the antigen to the detected antibody or where partner testing cannot be undertaken, typing of the fetal red cell status can be performed on a blood test from the woman. The test is usually carried out between 12-18 weeks. The results are accurate in $99\%$ of cases but in some cases a result cannot be given.</li>
                            <li>Confirmatory testing. Invasive testing using CVS or amniocentesis is usually undertaken only where there is a need to establish fetal karyotype for other reasons. In cases where ultrasound suggests developing anaemia a fetal blood sample prior to intrauterine transfusion will be tested for fetal blood typing.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>On-going surveillance</h4>
                        <p>Once the risk of a pregnancy being affected has been established the timing and frequency of repeat testing of antibody titres can be determined. The need for assessment of the fetus at risk can also be established.</p>
                        <p>Surveillance for fetal anaemia is now undertaken primarily using ultrasound measurement of the blood flow velocity within the fetal brain. Measurement of the maximum velocity in the fetal middle cerebral artery has been found to be as accurate as the old-fashioned measurement of bilirubin in amniotic fluid, but is without the attendant risks of serial amniocentesis.</p>
                        <p>The frequency of surveillance will be determined by the risk of anaemia, which is dependent on the type and level of antibody and the risk of the fetus being antigen-positive.</p>

                        <p>Fetal investigations are an integral aspect of antenatal care. Scientists and clinicians have developed a range of new diagnostic and imaging technologies. Some of these have been incorporated into national screening programmes and standards of care. The midwife must therefore ensure that women are informed about the benefits and risks associated with these technologies, so that they can make choices to suit their requirements. Undoubtedly, testing technologies profoundly influence women’s experiences of pregnancy and their early attachment to their unborn child. Midwives therefore have a duty to prepare women for tests through sensitive and accurate communications and then to support parents in their assimilation of information and decision-making once the results are known.</p>
                        <p>Maternal investigations also require careful counselling and thought as a constellation of unintended consequences can arise if women do not think through their screening choices, or are inadequately counselled.</p>
