                    <p>The term teaching method refers to the general principles, pedagogy and management strategies used for classroom instruction. Our choice of teaching method depends on what fits you. Your educational philosophy, classroom demographic, subject area(s) and school mission statement.</p>

                    <p>Teaching theories can be organized into four categories based on two major parameters:</p>
                    <p>A teacher-centered approach versus a student-centered approach, and high-tech material use versus low-tech material use.</p>

                    <p><strong>1. Teacher-Centered Approach to Learning</strong></p>
                    <p>Taken to its most extreme interpretation, teachers are the main authority figure in a teacher-centered instruction model. Students are viewed as ‚Äúempty vessels‚ÄùExternal link:open_in_new who passively receive knowledge from their teachers through lectures and direct instruction, with an end goal of positive results from testing and assessment. In this style, teaching and assessment are viewed as two separate entities; student learning is measured through objectively scored tests and assessments.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Student-Centered Approach to Learning</strong></p>
                    <p>While teachers are still an authority figure in a student-centered teaching model, teachers and students play an equally active role in the learning process.</p>
