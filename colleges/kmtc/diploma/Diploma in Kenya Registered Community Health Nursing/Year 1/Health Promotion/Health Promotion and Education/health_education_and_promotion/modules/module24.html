                    <p><strong>Conceptual knowledge requires examples, familiarity with the concept's features, contexts, and engagement/experience.</strong></p>
                    <p>involves strong sensory and experiential components. The brain acquires concepts with multiple representations in a network- right from what the concept looks on paper to how it feels to the senses.</p>
                    <p>Using YouTube videos and discussing Ted talks puts dense information in a familiar context. YouTube is a part of human culture, so are memes, putting information in the context of the internet culture can motivate or change the perception of the so-called ‚Äòboring' topics.</p>
                    <p>IMs and TAs also motivate students at the level of the classroom. This goes hand in hand with confidence (security that one can learn) as having materials is proof of accessing information. Having access can, at the very least, prime students to learn.</p>

                <h2>üìö Testing and assessment not only helps to confirm the learning of content but also helps improve the learning.</h2>

                    <p><strong>Testing and assessment not only helps to confirm the learning of content but also helps improve the learning.</strong></p>
                    <p>Relying on general information on the internet can overwhelm students due to an inherent lack of direction and potential misinformation. This problem can be solved by designing IMs to accommodate snowballing around a topic, using authority references, summarizing content or priming content like video overviews and infographics.</p>
                    <p>The cost of implementing TAs and IMs is not trivial. However, improved teaching efficacy and learning efficacy can significantly lower the burden of learning course content. Teachers may save time, students may require lesser effort to achieve learning goals, and primary organizational resources would be better managed (man-hours to pay for, classroom upkeep, scheduling). And even if it does cost the organization a little more, better learning would probably always be worth it.</p>
                    <p>Testing and assessment not only helps to confirm the learning of content but also helps improve the learning. Research has shown that being tested (the testing effect) can promote memory and conceptual understanding. Attempting worksheet exercises, quizzes, essays, etc. reinforce learning as well as create a hub for further self-motivated learning.
