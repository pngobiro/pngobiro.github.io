                    <p>TAs and IMs would work even better if they are aligned with brain-based learning concepts. These concepts are a framework to design a way the brain processes information. If TAs and IMs hijack these processes or even reinforce them, the growth in learning would be dramatic.</p>

                    <p><strong>Why develop a Monitoring and Evaluation Plan?</strong></p>
                    <p>It is important to develop an M&E plan before beginning any monitoring activities so that there is a clear plan for what questions about the program need to be answered. It will help program staff decide how they are going to collect data to track indicators, how monitoring data will be analyzed, and how the results of data collection will be disseminated both to the donor and internally among staff members for program improvement. Remember, M&E data alone is not useful until someone puts it to use! An M&E plan will help make sure data is being used efficiently to make programs as effective as possible and to be able to report on results at the end of the program.</p>
