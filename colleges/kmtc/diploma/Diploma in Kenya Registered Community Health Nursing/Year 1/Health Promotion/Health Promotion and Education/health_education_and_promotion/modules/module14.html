                    <p><strong>ii) Personal Model</strong></p>
                    <p>Teachers who operate under the ‚ÄúPersonal Model‚Äù style are those who lead by example, demonstrating to students how to access and comprehend information. In this teaching model, students learn through observing and copying the teacher's process.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>iii) Delegator</strong></p>
                    <p>Teachers acts as a ‚Äúresource‚Äù to students, answering questions and reviewing their progress as needed. Teachers play a passive role in student's learning; students are active and engaged participants in their learning. The main goal of a Delegator is to foster a sense of autonomy in the learning process. Teachers encourage students to ask questions and consider what they want to know about the world around them. Students then research their questions, find information and sources that explain key concepts and solve problems they may encounter along the way.</p>
                    <p>Findings might be presented as self-made videos, websites, or formal presentations of research results. Inquiry-based learning falls under the student-centered approach, in that students play an active and participatory role in their own learning. But teacher facilitation is also extremely key to the process. Usually, during the inquiry cycle, every student is working on a different question or topic. In this environment, teachers ask high-level questions and make research suggestions about the process rather than the content. At the end of the inquiry cycle, students reflect on the experience and what they learned. They also consider how it connects to other topics of interest, as an inquiry on one topic often results in more questions and then an inquiry into new fields. Inquiry-based learning can make great use of technology through online research sites, social media, and the possibility for global connections with people outside of the community. But depending on the subject at hand, it doesn't necessarily require it</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>b) Expeditionary Learning (High Tech)</strong></p>
                    <p>Expeditionary learning is based on the ideas of the educator who founded Outward Bound and is a form of project-based learning in which students go on expeditions and engage in in-depth study of topics that impact their schools and communities.</p>
                    <p>The learning in this model includes multiple content areas so that students can see how problem-solving can happen in the real world-ideally, their own worlds. A student in a big city, for example, might study statistics about pollution, read information about its effects, and travel to sites in their city that have been impacted by the problem. When they have a good understanding of the circumstances, students and teachers work to find a solution they can actively implement.</p>
                    <p>Technology-wise, G Suite (Google Docs, Sheets, and Drive) and internet access can aid student research, presentation, and implementation of projects. But it's the hands-on work and getting out into the community that's the cornerstone of this methodology.</p>
