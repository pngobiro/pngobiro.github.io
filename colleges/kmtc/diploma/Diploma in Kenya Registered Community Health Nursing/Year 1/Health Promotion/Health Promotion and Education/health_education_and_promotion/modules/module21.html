                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Example 1: A teacher is using a book in the class; each student has a copy.</strong></p>
                    <p>If a book is used as a course-prescribed resource, it is an instructional material.</p>
                    <p>If the book is a student engagement activity (reading and discussing a story to build vocabulary) and isn't a part of the syllabus, it would function as a teaching aid.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>üìö Example 2</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Example 2: You are studying algae under a microscope.</strong></p>
                    <p>A microscope would be an instructional material if a course-based learning goal is 'using a microscope to study microscopic entities'.</p>
                    <p>However, a microscope would be a teaching aid for a theory class on algae. A teacher could use one to show students what it looks like in order to engage the class in learning about algae.</p>
                    <p>Traditionally speaking, teaching aids have been thought of as devices that can be used ‚Äì white and blackboards, computers, calculators, projectors, slideshows, tape recordings, television, etc. Teaching aids are tools that help the delivery of information. A TA isn't information, or to put it in a different way, information is not directly embedded in a TA. But IMs often have information embedded in them. Resource books, worksheets, graphs, etc. are all IMs because of this embedding. However, tools such as microscopes are IMs if they are precisely aligned with a teaching objective.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes, graphical media can be used as both ‚Äì infographics could be a teaching aid if they help but not a core teaching resource, or they can be embedded within a book or used as a way to summarize a larger concept directly. Digital media is often considered as an Instructional material because information is embedded in it and it needs planning for educational use. This planning is eventually integrated into the coursework as a learning activity.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A book can be either a Teaching Aid or Instructional Material depending on its use: course-prescribed = IM, engagement activity = TA.</li>
                    <li>A microscope is an IM if learning to use it is a course goal, but a TA if used to demonstrate in a theory class.</li>
                    <li>Instructional Materials often embed information, while Teaching Aids help deliver information and can be tools or devices. The same object can function as either depending on context and learning objectives.</li>
