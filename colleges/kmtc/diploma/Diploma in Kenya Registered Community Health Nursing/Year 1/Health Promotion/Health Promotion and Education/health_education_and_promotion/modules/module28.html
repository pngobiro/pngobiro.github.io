                    <p><strong>Step 3: Define Data Collection Methods and Timeline</strong></p>
                    <p>After creating monitoring indicators, it is time to decide on methods for gathering data and how often various data will be recorded to track indicators. This should be a conversation between program staff, stakeholders, and donors. These methods will have important implications for what data collection methods will be used and how the results will be reported.</p>
                    <p>The source of monitoring data depends largely on what each indicator is trying to measure. The program will likely need multiple data sources to answer all of the programming questions.</p>
                    <p>Once it is determined how data will be collected, it is also necessary to decide how often it will be collected. This will be affected by donor requirements, available resources, and the timeline of the intervention. Some data will be continuously gathered by the program (such as the number of trainings), but these will be recorded every six months or once a year, depending on the M&E plan. Other types of data depend on outside sources, such as clinic and DHS data.</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 4: Identify M&E Roles and Responsibilities</strong></p>
                    <p>The next element of the M&E plan is a section on roles and responsibilities. It is important to decide from the early planning stages who is responsible for collecting the data for each indicator. This will probably be a mix of M&E staff, research staff, and program staff. Everyone will need to work together to get data collected accurately and in a timely fashion.</p>
                    <p>Data management roles should be decided with input from all team members so everyone is on the same page and knows which indicators they are assigned. This way when it is time for reporting there are no surprises.</p>

                    <li>Step 3 of M&E involves defining data collection methods and timelines, considering stakeholders and data sources relevant to each indicator.</li>
                    <li>Data collection methods and timelines are influenced by program needs, donor requirements, resources, and intervention timelines.</li>
                    <li>Step 4 is to clearly identify M&E roles and responsibilities, assigning data collection tasks to specific staff members from research and program teams.</li>
                    <li>Clearly defined roles and responsibilities ensure data is collected accurately, timely, and without surprises during reporting.</li>
