                    <p><strong>ii) Expert</strong></p>
                    <p>Expert teachers are in possession of all knowledge and expertise within the classroom. Their primary role is to guide and direct learners through the learning process. Students are viewed solely as the receptors of knowledge and information (‚Äúempty vessels‚Äù).</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>iii) Personal Model</strong></p>
                    <p>Teachers who operate under the ‚ÄúPersonal Model' style are those who lead by example, demonstrating to students how to access and comprehend information. In this teaching model, students learn through observing and copying the teacher's process. As the primary teaching strategy under the teacher-centered approach, direct instruction utilizes passive learning, or the idea that students can learn what they need to through listening and watching very precise instruction. Teachers and professors act as the sole supplier of knowledge, and under the direct instruction model, teachers often utilize systematic, scripted lesson plans. Direct instruction programs include exactly what the teacher should say, and activities that students should complete, for every minute of the lesson.</p>
                    <p>Because it does not include student preferences or give them opportunities for hands-on or alternative types of learning, direct instruction is extremely teacher-centered. it's also fairly low-tech, often relying on the use of textbooks and workbooks instead of computers and 1:1 devices</p>

                    <p><strong>b) Flipped Classrooms (High Tech)</strong></p>
                    <p>The idea of the flipped classroom began in 2007 when two teachers began using software that would let them record their live lectures External link:open_in_new. By the next school year, they were implementing pre-recorded lectures and sharing the idea of what became known as the flipped classroom.</p>
                    <p>Broadly, the flipped classroom label describes the teaching structure that has students watching pre-recorded lessons at home and completing in-class assignments, as opposed to hearing lectures in class and doing homework at home. Teachers who implement the flipped classroom model often film their own instructional videos, but many also use pre-made videos from online sources.</p>
                    <p>A key benefit of the flipped classroom model is that it allows for students to work at their own pace if that is how the teacher chooses to implement it. In some cases, teachers may assign the same videos to all students, while in others, teachers may choose to allow students to watch new videos as they master topics (taking on a more ‚Äúdifferentiated‚Äù approach). </p>
                    <p>But despite this potential for more student-centeredness, flipped classroom models are still mostly based on a teacher models are still mostly based on a teacher's idea of how learning should happen and what information students need, making it chiefly teacher-centered. From a technology perspective, the system hinges on pre-recorded lessons and online activities, meaning both students and teachers need a good internet connection and devices that can access it</p>
