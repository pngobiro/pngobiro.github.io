                    <p><strong>Step 1: Identify Program Goals and Objectives</strong></p>
                    <p>The first step to creating an M&E plan is to identify the program goals and objectives. If the program already has a logic model or theory of change, then the program goals are most likely already defined. However, if not, the M&E plan is a great place to start. Identify the program goals and objectives.</p>
                    <p>Defining program goals starts with answering three questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>-What problem is the program trying to solve?</li>
                        <li>-What steps are being taken to solve that problem?</li>
                        <li>-How will program staff know when the program has been successful in solving the problem?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Answering these questions will help identify what the program is expected to do, and how staff will know whether or not it worked.</p>
                    <p>It is also necessary to develop intermediate outputs and objectives for the program to help track successful steps on the way to the overall program goal. More information about identifying these objectives can be found in the logic model guide.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Step 2: Define Indicators</strong></p>
                    <p>Once the program's goals and objectives are defined, it is time to define indicators for tracking progress towards achieving those goals. Program indicators should be a mix of those that measure process, or what is being done in the program, and those that measure outcomes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Process indicators</strong> track the progress of the program. They help to answer the question, ‚ÄúAre activities being implemented as planned?‚Äù Some examples of process indicators are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Number of trainings held with health providers</li>
                        <li>Number of outreach activities conducted at youth-friendly locations</li>
                        <li>Number of condoms distributed at youth-friendly locations</li>
                        <li>Percent of youth reached with condom use messages through the media</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Outcome indicators</strong> track how successful program activities have been at achieving program objectives. They help to answer the question, ‚ÄúHave program activities made a difference?‚Äù</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1 of M&E is to clearly identify program goals and objectives, defining what the program aims to achieve and solve.</li>
                    <li>Defining program goals involves answering questions about the problem, solution steps, and success measurement.</li>
                    <li>Step 2 is to define indicators to track progress, using a mix of process and outcome indicators.</li>
                    <li>Process indicators measure program implementation, while outcome indicators assess the impact and effectiveness of program activities.</li>
