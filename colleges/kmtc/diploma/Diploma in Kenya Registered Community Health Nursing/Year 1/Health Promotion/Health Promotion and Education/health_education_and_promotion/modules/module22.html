                    <p><strong>Teaching aids, Instructional material, and resources for the digital learning sphere</strong></p>
                    <p>An incredible amount of learning takes place online. That's why teachers have redesigned & repurposed their content for online delivery.</p>
                    <p>Many decades ago, TAs and IMs were focused on classroom activities. However, the very definition of the classroom has changed. The world has moved online and online classes are now a valid alternative method of conducting educational activities. Lectures are presented via ZOOM, Skype, and Microsoft Meetings. All notes are provided digitally. A typical class appears on a screen as a collection of students and teachers. What materials and aids work in such a situation? What are the unique problems of such classes that TA & IMs can solve?</p>

                <h2>üìö Most students are very familiar with searching for supplemental material on the Internet</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Most students are very familiar with searching for supplemental material on the Internet.</strong></p>
                    <p>Most prominently, students use Wikipedia, professional YouTube channels like In a nutshell, Sci-show, Veritasium, Numberphile and CGP gray, Reddit (asking questions, finding sources, discussing), and additional independent content offered by courses on Coursera, Udemy, and Khan Academy. Many students even run their blogs to show what they learn and jot down notes. Some make creative videos and run podcasts. These are all self-motivated alternatives to the use of TAs and IMs. These work because millennial and gen Z students prefer autonomy and control in how they learn. They are intrinsically motivated because they have the choice to choose how they learn. Teachers can facilitate this and tap into this autonomy. Teachers can also curate these resources for students based on their preferences and learning goals.</p>
