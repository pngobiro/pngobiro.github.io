                    <p><strong>c) Kinesthetic Learning (Low Tech)</strong></p>
                    <p>Sometimes known as tactile learning‚Äùor ‚Äúhands-on learning‚Äù, kinesthetic learning is based on the idea of multiple intelligences External link External link:open_in_new, requiring students to do, make, or create. In a kinesthetic learning environment, students perform physical activities rather than listen to lectures or watch demonstrations. Hands-on experiences, drawing, role-play, building, and the use of drama and sports are all examples of kinesthetic classroom activities.</p>
                    <p>Though a great way to keep students engaged and, at times, simply awake, very few classrooms employ kinesthetic learning activities exclusively. One reason is that, despite the popularity of learning style theories, there is a lack of research-based evidence that shows that teaching to certain learning styles produces better academic results</p>
                    <p>One upside is that kinesthetic learning is rarely based on technology, as the method values movement and creativity over technological skills. That means it's cheap and fairly low-barrier to adopt, as well as a welcome break from students' existing screen time. Kinesthetic learning can be more student-centered than teacher-centered when students are given the choice of how to use movement to learn new information or experience new skills, so it's also adaptable to a teacher's particular classroom preferences.</p>
