                    <p><strong>1. Authority, or lecture style</strong></p>
                    <p>The authority model is teacher-centered and frequently entails lengthy lecture sessions or one-way presentations. Students are expected to take notes or absorb information.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> This style is acceptable for certain higher-education disciplines and auditorium settings with large groups of students. The pure lecture style is most suitable for subjects like history, which necessitate memorization of key facts, dates, names, etc.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> It's a questionable model for teaching children because there is little or no interaction with the teacher. Plus it can get a little snooze-y. That's why it's a better approach for older, more mature students.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. The Demonstrator, or coach style</strong></p>
                    <p>The demonstrator retains the formal authority role by showing students what they need to know.</p>
                    <p>The demonstrator is a lot like the lecturer, but their lessons include multimedia presentations, activities, and demonstrations. (Think: Math. Science. Music.)</p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> This style gives teachers opportunities to incorporate a variety of formats including lectures and multimedia presentations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Although it's well-suited for teaching mathematics, music, physical education, or arts and crafts, it is difficult to accommodate students' individual needs in larger classrooms.</p>

                    <li>The Authority or lecture style is teacher-centered, efficient for large groups and memorization-heavy subjects, but lacks interaction and engagement for younger learners.</li>
                    <li>The Demonstrator or coach style combines authority with multimedia and activities, suitable for subjects needing demonstration, but still challenges individual needs in large classes.</li>
