                    <p><strong>c) Personalized Learning (High Tech)</strong></p>
                    <p>Personalized learning is such a new educational model that its definition is still evolving. At the heart of the model, teachers have students follow personalized learning plans that are specific to their interests and skills. Student self-direction and choice in the curriculum are hallmarks of personalized learning.</p>
                    <p>Assessment is also tailored to the individual: schools and classrooms that implement personalized learning use competency-based progression, so that students can move onto the next standards or topics when they've mastered what they're currently working on. That way, students in personalized learning classrooms can progress to work beyond their grade level as they master topics, while students who need additional help have that time built into their daily schedules as well.</p>
                    <p>There's also room for an emphasis on college and career readiness in personalized learning environments. Students who don't require remediation or extension work can instead work with teachers to nurture social skills and other or 21st-century skills lessons and receive mentoring.</p>
                    <p>Personalized learning is extremely student centered, but teachers are required to teach lessons, look at frequent assessment data, and meet with students to make any necessary changes to their learning plans. They'll also need to have a certain comfort level with technology: the differentiated and personalized instruction that students receive often come in the form of online lessons and programs, so teachers must be able to navigate virtual platforms with ease.</p>

                    <p><strong>d) Game-based Learning (High Tech)</strong></p>
                    <p>Game-based learning comes from the desire to engage students in more active learning in the classroom. Because they require students to be problem solvers and use soft skills that they will need as adults, games are a great way to encourage a ‚Äúmastery‚Äù mindset, rather than a focus on grades.</p>
                    <p>In a game-based learning environment, students work on quests to accomplish a specific goal (learning objective) by choosing actions and experimenting along the way. As students make certain progress or achievements, they can earn badges and experience points, just like they would in their favorite video games.</p>
                    <p>Game-based learning requires a lot of time and planning on the teachers' part. Fortunately, there is software that makes this process much easier. Teachers who use this software may be better at differentiating quests for students because of the data the programs provide.</p>
                    <p>Because teachers play a big role in planning and creating content under this model, game-based learning isn't completely student-centered. But it is still very much focused on the student, who works at their own pace and makes independent choices in a gamified environment.</p>
