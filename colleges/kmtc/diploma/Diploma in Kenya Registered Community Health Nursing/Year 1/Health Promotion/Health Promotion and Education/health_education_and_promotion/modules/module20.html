                    <p><strong>Key differences between Teaching aids and Instructional materials</strong></p>
                    <p>As you'll see in this article, TAs and IMs work together to reach teaching goals. However, the traditional separation of TAs and IMs is superficial and needs revision. It breaks down based on who uses a specific tool and how it is used. Dictionaries don't define Instructional materials clearly. The term ‚Äúinstructional material‚Äù is largely restricted to the literature on specific pedagogies. In fact, the term ‚ÄòInstructional materials' is used in the context of reaching course-based learning goals. IMs are specifically designed to align with learning objectives and outcomes. Whereas, teaching aids are not always designed to meet course-based goals. You might have guessed ‚Äì the same object can be a TA or an IM.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Instructional Materials are classified into traditional, digital media, open, and testing resources.</li>
                    <li>Traditional resources include textbooks and lectures; digital media includes videos and podcasts.</li>
                    <li>Open resources are freely available, like blogs and open courseware; testing resources include quizzes and assignments.</li>
                    <li>Teaching Aids and Instructional Materials work together but differ in purpose: IMs are designed for course-based goals, while TAs are more general teaching tools, and sometimes the same item can be both.</li>
