                    <p>The search for content online taps into our ‚Äútransactive memory.‚Äù A novel problem of internet-based learning is the potential to forget what you learn because we remember where to find information better than what the information is (The Google Effect). Many students can now take the time to look for information because they are good at it. Knowing this, many don't feel the value in remembering it. However, remembering information is a necessary condition to make it "intuitive."</p>
