                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>3. The Facilitator, or activity style</strong></p>
                    <p>Facilitators promote self-learning and help students develop critical thinking skills and retain knowledge that leads to self-actualization.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> This style trains students to ask questions and helps develop skills to find answers and solutions through exploration; it is ideal for teaching science and similar subjects.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Challenges teacher to interact with students and prompt them toward discovery rather than lecturing facts and testing knowledge through memorization. So it's a bit harder to measure success in tangible terms.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>4. The Delegator, or group style</strong></p>
                    <p>The delegator style is best suited for curricula that require lab activities, such as chemistry and biology, or subjects that warrant peer feedback, like debate and creative writing.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Guided discovery and inquiry-based learning place the teacher in an observer role that inspires students by working in tandem toward common goals.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Considered a modern style of teaching, it is sometimes criticized as eroding teacher authority. As a delegator, the teacher acts more as a consultant rather than the traditional authority figure.</p>

                    <p><strong>5. The Hybrid, or blended style</strong></p>
                    <p>Hybrid, or blended style, follows an integrated approach to teaching that blends the teacher's personality and interests with students' needs and curriculum-appropriate methods.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Inclusive! And it enables teachers to tailor their styles to student needs and appropriate subject matter.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Hybrid style runs the risk of trying to be too many things to all students, prompting teachers to spread themselves too thin and dilute learning.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Facilitator style promotes self-learning and critical thinking through exploration, ideal for science but harder to measure success.</li>
                    <li>The Delegator style suits lab-based and peer-feedback subjects, fostering guided discovery but potentially reducing traditional teacher authority.</li>
                    <li>The Hybrid or blended style integrates teacher personality with student needs and curriculum, offering inclusivity but risking dilution by trying to do too much.</li>
