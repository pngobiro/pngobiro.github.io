                    <p><strong>What is step one about?</strong></p>
                    <p>Project management is about developing and managing a ‚Äúplan to plan‚Äù. A good project management plan clearly describes steps and tasks, assigns people to various roles, sets deadlines and milestones, and shows resource allocation. This is primarily done through a work plan that indicates tasks necessary to produce a comprehensive, credible and compelling program plan. However, you may use many other project management documents and tools to supplement the work plan. For example, terms of reference that outline roles, responsibilities and decision-making processes can be very useful. Project management starts at the beginning of the planning process, and must take into account any assumptions, expectations and other contextual issues Project management does not end until the program plan is completed and approved, signaling the beginning of the development and implementation phase.</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 2: Conduct a situational assessment</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> to learn more about the population of interest, trends, and issues that may affect implementation, including the wants, needs, and assets of the community. This step involves identifying: what is the situation; what is making the situation better and what is making it worse; and what possible actions you can take to address the situation. Use diverse types of data (e.g. community health status indicators, stories/testimonials; evaluation findings; "best practice" guidelines), sources of data (e.g. polling companies; community/partner organizations; researchers; governments; private sector); and data collection methods (e.g. stakeholder interviews or focus groups; surveys; literature reviews; review of past evaluation findings or stakeholder mandates/policies).</p>
