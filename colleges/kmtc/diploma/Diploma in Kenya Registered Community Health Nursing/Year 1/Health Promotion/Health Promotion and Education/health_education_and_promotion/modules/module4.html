                    <p><strong>Step 4: identify strategies, activities, outputs, process objectives and resources</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> to use the results of the situational assessment to select strategies and activities, feasible with available resources, that will contribute to your goals and outcome objectives. Brainstorm strategies (e.g. health education, health communication, organizational change, policy development) for achieving objectives using one or more health promotion frameworks such as the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion or the socioecological model. Prioritize ideas by applying situational assessment results. Identify specific activities for each strategy, including which existing activities to start, stop, and continue. Select outputs and develop process objectives. Consider available financial, human and in-kind resources.</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 5: develop indicators</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> to develop a list of variables that can be tracked to assess the extent to which outcome and process objectives have been met. For each outcome and process objective consider the intended result and whether: the intended result can be divided into separate components; the intended result can be measured; there is appropriate time for observing a result; required data sources are accessible; and the resources needed to assess the result are available. Define indicators to measure each outcome and process objective and perform a quality check on proposed indicators ensuring they are valid, reliable, and accessible. Indicators are used to determine the extent to which outcomes and process objectives were met.</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 6: review the program plan</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> to clarify the contribution of each component of the plan to its objectives, identify gaps, ensure adequate resources, and ensure consistency with the situational assessment findings. A logic model is a graphic depiction of the relationship between all parts of a program (i.e., goals, objectives, populations, strategies, and activities) and is one way in which a program overview can be communicated. Review the plan to determine whether: strategies effectively contribute to goals and objectives; short-term objectives contribute to long-term objectives; the best activities were chosen to advance the strategy; activities are appropriate to the audiences; and the resources are adequate to implement the activities</p>
