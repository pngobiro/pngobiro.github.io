                    <p><strong>Step 5: Create an Analysis Plan and Reporting Templates</strong></p>
                    <p>Once all of the data have been collected, someone will need to compile and analyze it to fill in a results table for internal review and external reporting. This is likely to be an in-house M&E manager or research assistant for the program.</p>
                    <p>The M&E plan should include a section with details about what data will be analyzed and how the results will be presented. Do research staff need to perform any statistical tests to get the needed answers? If so, what tests are they and what data will be used in them? What software program will be used to analyze data and make reporting tables? Excel? SPSS? These are important considerations.</p>
                    <p>Another good thing to include in the plan is a blank table for indicator reporting. These tables should outline the indicators, data, and time period of reporting. They can also include things like the indicator target, and how far the program has progressed towards that target.</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 6: Plan for Dissemination and Donor Reporting</strong></p>
                    <p>The last element of the M&E plan describes how and to whom data will be disseminated. Data for data's sake should not be the ultimate goal of M&E efforts. Data should always be collected for particular purposes.</p>
                    <p>Consider the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How will M&E data be used to inform staff and stakeholders about the success and progress of the program?</li>
                        <li>How will it be used to help staff make modifications and course corrections, as necessary?</li>
                        <li>How will the data be used to move the field forward and make program practices more effective?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The M&E plan should include plans for internal dissemination among the program team, as well as wider dissemination among stakeholders and donors. For example, a program team may want to review data on a monthly basis to make programmatic decisions and develop future workplans, while meetings with the donor to review data and program progress might occur quarterly or annually. Dissemination of printed or digital materials might occur at more frequent intervals. These options should be discussed with stakeholders and your team to determine reasonable expectations for data review and to develop plans for dissemination early in the program. If these plans are in place from the beginning and become routine for the project, meetings and other kinds of periodic review have a much better chance of being productive ones that everyone looks forward to.</p>

                    <li>Step 5 of M&E involves creating a data analysis plan and reporting templates to compile, analyze, and present data effectively for review and reporting.</li>
                    <li>The analysis plan should detail data analysis methods, statistical tests, software to be used, and include blank reporting tables outlining indicators and reporting periods.</li>
                    <li>Step 6 focuses on planning data dissemination and donor reporting to ensure data is used for program improvement, accountability, and informing stakeholders.</li>
                    <li>Dissemination plans should consider internal team sharing, stakeholder reporting, and frequency of data review to facilitate programmatic decisions and course corrections.</li>
