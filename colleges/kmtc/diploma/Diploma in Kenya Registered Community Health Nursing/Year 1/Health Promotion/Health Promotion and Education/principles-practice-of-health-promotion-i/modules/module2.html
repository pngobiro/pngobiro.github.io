                <div class="content-block">
                   <h3>2.3.1 The six steps for planning a health promotion program</h3>
                   <h4>Step 1: Manage the Planning Process</h4>
                     <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> to develop a plan to manage stakeholder participation, timelines, resources, and determine methods for data-gathering, interpretation, and decision making.</p>
                    <ul>
                         <li>Plan to engage stakeholders, including clients and staff, in a meaningful way.</li>
                         <li>Establish a clear timeline for creating a work plan.</li>
                         <li>Plan how you will allocate financial, material, and human resources.</li>
                          <li>Consider the data required to make decisions at each step and include adequate time for data collection and interpretation. Establish a clear decision-making process. (e.g., by consensus, by committee)</li>
                     </ul>
                   <h4>Step 2: Conduct a Situational Assessment</h4>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> to learn more about the population of interest, trends, and issues that may affect implementation, including the wants, needs, and assets of the community.</p>
                   <p>This step involves identifying:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>what is the situation;</li>
                       <li>what is making the situation better;</li>
                        <li>what is making it worse; and</li>
                         <li>What possible actions you can take to address the situation.</li>
                   </ul>
                    <p>Use diverse types of data (e.g. community health status indicators, stories/testimonials; evaluation findings; "best practice" guidelines), sources of data (e.g. polling companies; community/partner organizations; researchers; governments; private sector); and data collection methods (e.g. stakeholder interviews or focus groups; surveys; literature reviews; review of past evaluation findings or stakeholder mandates/policies).</p>
                   <h4>Step 3: Identify goals, populations of Interest, outcomes and outcome objectives</h4>
                      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> to use situational assessment results to determine goals, populations of interest, outcomes and outcome objectives.</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li><strong>Goal:</strong> a broad statement providing overall direction for a program over a long period of time.</li>
                          <li><strong>Population(s) of interest:</strong> group or groups that require special attention to achieve your goal</li>
                          <li><strong>Outcome objective:</strong> brief statement specifying the desired change caused by the program</li>
                      </ul>
                   <h4>Step 4: Identify Strategies, activities, outputs, process objectives and resources</h4>
                     <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> to use the results of the situational assessment to select strategies and activities, feasible with available resources, that will contribute to your goals and outcome objectives.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Brainstorm strategies (e.g. health education, health communication, organizational change, policy development) for achieving objectives using one or more health promotion frameworks such as the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion or the socioecological model.</li>
                       <li>Prioritize ideas by applying situational assessment results.</li>
                       <li>Identify specific activities for each strategy, including which existing activities to start, stop, and continue. Select outputs and develop process objectives. Consider available financial, human and in-kind resources.</li>
                    </ul>
                  <h4>Step 5: Develop Indicators</h4>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> to develop a list of variables that can be tracked to assess the extent to which outcome and process objectives have been met.</p>
                      <p>For each outcome and process objective consider the intended result and whether: the intended result can be divided into separate components; the intended result can be measured; there is appropriate time for observing a result; required data sources are accessible; and the resources needed to assess the result are available.</p>
                     <p>Define indicators to measure each outcome and process objective and perform a quality check on proposed indicators ensuring they are valid, reliable, and accessible. Indicators are used to determine the extent to which outcomes and process objectives were met.</p>
                    <h4>Step 6: Review the program plan</h4>
                      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> to clarify the contribution of each component of the plan to its objectives, identify gaps, ensure adequate resources, and ensure consistency with the situational assessment findings.</p>
                    <p>A logic model is a graphic depiction of the relationship between all parts of a program (i.e., goals, objectives, populations, strategies, and activities) and is one way in which a program overview can be communicated. Review the plan to determine whether: strategies effectively contribute to goals and objectives; short-term objectives contribute to long-term objectives; the best activities were chosen to advance the strategy; activities are appropriate to the audiences; and the resources are adequate to implement the activities.</p>

                <h2>üìö 2.4 Focus of health promotion</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                   <p>Health promotion focuses on the following aspects:</p>
                    <p><strong>Good Governance:</strong> Strengthen governance and policies to make healthy choices accessible and affordable to all, and create sustainable systems that make whole-of-society collaboration real. This approach is based on the rationale that health is determined by multiple factors outside the direct control of the health sector (e.g. education, income, and individual living conditions) and that decisions made in other sectors can affect the health of individuals and shape patterns of disease distribution and mortality.</p>
                     <p><strong>Health Literacy:</strong> Improving health literacy in populations provides the foundation on which citizens are enabled to play an active role in improving their own health, engage successfully with community action for health, and push governments to meet their responsibilities in addressing health and health equity.</p>
                    <p><strong>Healthy Settings:</strong> The settings approach has roots in the WHO Health for All strategy and, more specifically, the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion. Healthy Settings key principles include community participation, partnership, empowerment and equity. The Healthy Cities programme is the best-known example of a successful Healthy Settings programme.</p>
                   <p><strong>Social mobilization:</strong> Bringing together all societal and personal influences to raise awareness of and demand for health care, assist in the delivery of resources and services, and cultivate sustainable individual and community involvement.</p>

                <h2>üìö 2.5 Background of health promotion strategies</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                  <p><strong>Strategies:</strong> Health promotion strategies are actions that bring about change in a health issue, risk factor or risk condition. They can be one-off strategies, such as an allied health professional delivering health education to a client, or they can be a combination of strategies that are used to meet overall objectives and goals in a program.</p>
                    <p>A strategy states how we are going to achieve each objective and are often made up of a whole lot of activities.</p>
                    <p>in creates conditions that allow the attainment of health by all its members.</p>
                    <p>Caring, holism and ecology are essential issues in developing strategies for health promotion. Therefore, those involved should take as a guiding principle that, in each phase of planning, implementation and evaluation of health promotion activities, women and men should become equal partners.</p>

                <h2>üìö 2.6 Health Promotion Strategies</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                     <h3>2.6.1 Screening, Individual risk assessment and Immunization</h3>
                   <p>Strategies used at this level are generally delivered at a downstream level usually targeting Individuals. Some examples of strategies used at this level are described below:</p>
                   <p><strong>a) Screening strategies:</strong> Screening for particular risks or diseases can be conducted using already developed tools (that have often been validated). Using the results from screening tests can be important in informing further assessment and care for all patients</p>
                   <p><strong>b) Risk factor assessments:</strong> All allied health professionals will at some point be involved in conducting risk factor assessments. These might include such things as:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Health risk appraisal questionnaires ‚Äì clients can complete a questionnaire to assess level of risk and a health professional can then use these as stimulators and a starting point for further discussion and/or counselling.</li>
                         <li>Blood sugar screening</li>
                          <li>Dietary assessment</li>
                          <li>Fitness assessments</li>
                         <li>Hypertension assessments</li>
                         <li>Stress assessments</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p><strong>c) Immunization:</strong> This is an important downstream strategy and while most allied health professionals are not directly involved in administering immunizations, they can definitely play a role in promoting immunizations, thus contributing to a reduction in vaccine preventable diseases.</p>
                   <h3>2.6.2 Health Education</h3>
                    <p>Education has always been an important strategy used in health promotion and there remains confusion that health education IS health promotion. It IS NOT. Health education is a health promotion strategy not health promotion.</p>
                   <p>Health education can be delivered by health professionals as planned sessions to individuals or groups with the aim of improving knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, individual capacity to change or it can be delivered ‚Äúopportunistically‚Äù with clients ‚Äì for example a client is seen in an Emergency Department for chest pain and it is an ideal time to provide ‚Äúeducation‚Äù about smoking (if they were a smoker). Education is often delivered in settings such as in the school setting, in a health care setting or in a workplace setting.</p>
                    <p>Examples of educational strategies include:</p>
                    <ul>
                       <li>Development of audiovisual aids, e.g. DVDs, flipcharts, posters, pamphlets</li>
                        <li>Behaviour modification education ‚Äì brief interventions, motivational interviewing</li>
                        <li>Education sessions ‚Äì eg about the benefits of physical activity</li>
                         <li>Individual instruction and demonstration ‚Äì healthy eating/cooking demonstration,</li>
                         <li>Simulations, games, demonstrations, role plays, case studies</li>
                         <li>Lectures, discussions, inquiry/problem-based learning</li>
                         <li>Peer group discussions</li>
                         <li>Computer assisted learning</li>
                        <li>Patient education - inpatient, outpatient, hospital programs (health promoting hospitals),</li>
                       <li>Self-help materials</li>
                    </ul>
                      <p>(Adapted from Egger, Spark and Lawson 1990).</p>
                  <h3>2.6.3 Community Action and Community Participation</h3>
                    <p>Community action is about engaging with and empowering individuals and communities to have control over their own health. It often involves working with groups and these can be used to:</p>
                    <ul>
                       <li>Empower individuals, organisations and communities</li>
                       <li>Assist individuals to modify/maintain health-related behaviour</li>
                        <li>Provide a supportive setting for individuals to share common goals/problems- e.g. weight loss groups</li>
                        <li>Assist communities and organisations to identify and solve their own problems</li>
                       <li>Facilitate individuals and groups coming together to influence macro level social change</li>
                   </ul>
                  <h3>2.6.4 Settings and supportive environments</h3>
                    <p>Strategies at this level includes strategies such as:</p>
                   <ul>
                      <li>Policies</li>
                      <li>Legislation</li>
                       <li>Regulation</li>
                       <li>Environmental change ‚Äì eg changing a work or school environment</li>
                      <li>Structural change and modification ‚Äì e.g. home safety features to prevent injury in the home</li>
                     <li>Organisational development ‚Äì policies that integrate health promotion principles into organisations</li>
                     <li>Capacity building</li>
                   </ul>
                 <h3>2.6.5 Advocacy.</h3>
                     <p>Advocacy means to actively support an idea or cause by arguing in favor of it, in order to influence a decision</p>
                    <p>Advocacy includes such things as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mass mobilization</li>
                        <li>Social action</li>
                        <li>Community planning</li>
                        <li>Community education</li>

                <h2>üìö 2.8 Impact of health promotion</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                   <p><strong>a) Build Healthy Public Policy:</strong> Health promotion goes beyond health care. It puts health on the agenda of policy makers in all sectors and at all levels, directing them to be aware of the health consequences of their decisions and to accept their responsibilities for health.</p>
                     <p>Health promotion policy combines diverse but complementary approaches including legislation, fiscal measures, taxation and organizational change. It is coordinated action that leads to health, income and social policies that foster greater equity. Joint action contributes to ensuring safer and healthier goods and services, healthier public services, and cleaner, more enjoyable environments.</p>
                     <p>Health promotion policy requires the identification of obstacles to the adoption of healthy public policies in non-health sectors, and ways of removing them. The aim must be to make the healthier choice the easier choice for policy makers as well.</p>
                     <p><strong>b) Create Supportive Environments:</strong> Our societies are complex and interrelated. Health cannot be separated from other goals. The inextricable links between people and their environment constitutes the basis for a socioecological approach to health. The overall guiding principle for the world, nations, regions and communities alike, is the need to encourage reciprocal maintenance - to take care of each other, our communities and our natural environment. The conservation of natural resources throughout the world should be emphasized as a global responsibility.</p>
                     <p>Changing patterns of life, work and leisure have a significant impact on health. Work and leisure should be a source of health for people. The way society organizes work should help create a healthy society. Health promotion generates living and working conditions that are safe, stimulating, satisfying and enjoyable.</p>
                     <p>Systematic assessment of the health impact of a rapidly changing environment - particularly in areas of technology, work, energy production and urbanization - is essential and must be followed by action to ensure positive benefit to the health of the public. The protection of the natural and built environments and the conservation of natural resources must be addressed in any health promotion strategy.</p>
                   <p><strong>c) Strengthen Community Actions:</strong> Health promotion works through concrete and effective community action in setting priorities, making decisions, planning strategies and implementing them to achieve better health. At the heart of this process is the empowerment of communities - their ownership and control of their own endeavours and destinies.</p>
                     <p>Community development draws on existing human and material resources in the community to enhance self-help and social support, and to develop flexible systems for strengthening public participation in and direction of health matters. This requires full and continuous access to information, learning opportunities for health, as well as funding support.</p>
                     <p><strong>d) Develop Personal Skills:</strong> Health promotion supports personal and social development through providing information, education for health, and enhancing life skills. By so doing, it increases the options available to people to exercise more control over their own health and over their environments, and to make choices conducive to health.</p>
                     <p>Enabling people to learn, throughout life, to prepare themselves for all of its stages and to cope with chronic illness and injuries is essential. This has to be facilitated in school, home, work and community settings. Action is required through educational, professional, commercial and voluntary bodies, and within the institutions themselves.</p>
                    <p><strong>e) Reorient Health Services:</strong> The responsibility for health promotion in health services is shared among individuals, community groups, health professionals, health service institutions and governments.</p>
                      <p>They must work together towards a health care system which contributes to the pursuit of health. The role of the health sector must move increasingly in a health promotion direction, beyond its responsibility for providing clinical and curative services. Health services need to embrace an expanded mandate which is sensitive and respects cultural needs. This mandate should support the needs of individuals and communities for a healthier life, and open channels between the health sector and broader social, political, economic and physical environmental components.</p>
                      <p>Reorienting health services also requires stronger attention to health research as well as changes in professional education and training. This must lead to a change of attitude and organization of health services which refocuses on the total needs of the individual as a whole person.</p>
                     <p><strong>f) Moving into the Future:</strong> Health is created and lived by people within the settings of their everyday life; where they learn, work, play and love. Health is created by caring for oneself and others, by being able to take decisions and have control over one's life circumstances, and by ensuring that the society one lives in creates conditions that allow the attainment of health by all its members.</p>
                    <p>Caring, holism and ecology are essential issues in developing strategies for health promotion. Therefore, those involved should take as a guiding principle that, in each phase of planning, implementation and evaluation of health promotion activities, women and men should become equal partners.</p>
