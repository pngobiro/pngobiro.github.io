                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Health Education</strong> is any combination of learning experiences designed to help individuals and communities improve their health, by increasing their knowledge or influencing their attitudes. WHO defines health education as ‚Äúcomprising of consciously constructed opportunities for learning involving some form of communication designed to improve health literacy, including improving knowledge and developing life skills which are conducive to individual and community health.‚Äù Basic literacy is an essential building block for development and health promotion. Health literacy interventions need to be designed based on health, social and cultural needs. Purpose of health education is to positively influence health behavior of individuals and communities as well as their living and working condition.</p>
                    <p><strong>Visual Products (IEC Materials)</strong> Health promotion activities rely on a variety of well-designed and effective visual products to help ensure success. Every brochure, poster, videotape or other piece of IEC material is the product of a decision, supported by research, to deal with a specific health concern, and to be well received and persuasive among a specific audience.</p>
                    <p>The success and impact of visual products depends largely on the understanding of the target audience. Working with target audience members throughout the development of visual products, and in developing usage strategies for those materials, helps ensure that visual products meet the needs of the intended target audience.</p>
                    <p>This handbook offers a set of basic steps for developing visual products to follow in the planning, design (or adaptation) and production. It outlines a clear, six-step approach, with each step supporting the next, which design teams should endeavor to follow.</p>
                    <p><strong>The six steps include:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>STEP 1: Select appropriate visual products</li>
                        <li>STEP 2: Develop a creative brief</li>
                        <li>STEP 3: Prepare drafts/ prototype visual products or adapting existing materials</li>
                        <li>STEP 4: Pre-test drafts/ prototypes or adopted materials</li>
                        <li>STEP 5: Assess pre-test result and reviewing visual products</li>
                        <li>STEP 6: Monitor the use and impact of visual product</li>
