                <div class="content-block">
                  <h3>Good Health</h3>
                  <p>So just what are the most important factors for establishing optimum health. Studies indicate that the following five factors make the biggest difference in overall health and wellness:diet, rest; exercise posture and avoiding the use of alcohol, drugs and tobacco.</p>
                    <h3>Poor Health</h3>
                    <p>Many factors combine together to affect the health of individuals and communities. Whether people are healthy or not, is determined by their circumstances and environment. To a large extent, factors such as where we live, the state of our environment, genetics, our income and education level, and our relationships with friends and family all have considerable impacts on health, whereas the more commonly considered factors such as access and use of health care services often have less of an impact.</p>
                    <h3>3.5.1 Social Economic determinants of health</h3>
                    <ul>
                       <li><strong>Living and Working Conditions:</strong> Poor social and economic circumstances affect health throughout life. People down the social ladder run at least twice the risk of serious illness and premature death as those at the top (WHO, 2003). The daily conditions in which people live have a strong influence on health equity. Access to quality housing and shelter and clean water and sanitation are human rights and basic needs for healthy living.</li>
                        <li><strong>Education:</strong> For the population as a whole, greater levels of education help to create wealthier economies. Education can impact positively on levels of social engagement, an important factor in generating more cohesive, safer and healthier societies. At an individual level, the knowledge, personal and social skills provided through education can better equip individuals to access and use information and services to maintain and improve their own and their family's health Those with lower levels of education are more likely to die at a younger age and are at increased risk of poorer health throughout life than those with higher education. Those with higher education are likely to have greater knowledge of health conditions and treatment regimens and vice versa (Higgins, et al, 2008). Educational level of parents can influence child and family health related behaviors (Higgins, et al, 2008).</li>
                        <li><strong>Social behaviors and attitudes:</strong> Education plays a role in the socialization process by supporting and embedding habits, skills and values conducive to social cooperation and increased participation in society (Higgins, et al, 2008).</li>
                       <li><strong>Agriculture and food production:</strong> Agriculture is essential for good health. It produces food, and materials for shelter, produces medicinal plants; is an important source of livelihood for many of the poor in developing countries (Hawkes & Ruel, 2006). Food insecurity is related to a variety of negative health outcomes for all ages. Food insecurity: limited availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods, or limited ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways (without scavenging, stealing) (GIH, 2012). Potential consequences of food insecurity include both hunger and poor nutrition. Causes of food insecurity include: financial constraints associated with low income and joblessness, limited access to sufficient variety and affordable prices, and the added cost of a nutritious diet. Food insecurity is related to a variety of negative health outcomes for all ages. But, children are most at risk of: physical, mental, and social development, growth, and health throughout childhood (GIH, 2012).</li>
                       <li><strong>Social & Community Networks</strong></li>
                       <li><strong>Housing:</strong> Adequate housing has been recognized as a fundamental condition and resource for health. Poor housing is defined as housing in a state of substandard physical and environmental condition, referring both to internal and external conditions (Wellesley Institute, 2012). Good health depends on having homes that are safe and free from physical hazards. Adequate housing protects individuals and families from harmful exposures and provides them with a sense of privacy, security, stability, and control (Wood, 2008). Poor quality and inadequate housing contributes to health problems such as infectious and chronic diseases, injuries, and poor childhood development. Density of housing; internal conditions (dampness, heat, and air conditions); the presence of contaminants, vermin, or pests (Wood, 2008). Residential crowding has been linked with infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. Poor indoor air quality, lead paint, lack of home safety devices, and other housing hazards often coexist in homes, placing children and families at great risk for multiple health problems (Wood, 2008).</li>
                       <li><strong>Health Care Services:</strong> The health-care system is itself a social determinant of health, influenced by and influencing the effect of other social determinants. Gender, education, occupation, income, ethnicity, and place of residence are all closely linked to people's access to, experiences of, and benefits from health care (WHO, 2008). Universal coverage requires that everyone within a country can access the same range of (good quality) services according to needs and preferences, regardless of income level, social status, or residency, and that people are empowered to use these services (WHO, 2008). May be realized through financing the health-care system through general taxation and/or mandatory universal insurance (WHO, 2008).</li>
                       <li><strong>Water and Sanitation:</strong> Access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation can have a strong positive effect on human health, WHO (1986), defined sanitation as, ‚Äúthe means of collecting and disposing of excreta and community liquid wastes in a hygienic way, not to endanger the health of individuals and the community as a whole‚Äù. Human waste is full of disease-causing bacteria contaminating the air, food and water. When the human waste is produced in the open and remains untreated, it interacts with the food chain through soil, water and crops (Bartram, et al, 2005). When raw wastewater is discharged into the environment, water bodies become contaminated by pollutants from industries, e.g. heavy metals (mercury, lead). Accumulation of pollutants in water bodies may cause irreversible environmental problems, especially groundwater pollution (Drewko, 2007). Pollution of rivers, lakes, oceans and groundwater with sewage, damages aquatic biodiversity. Local people might be dependent on some of the affected species for food and livelihood (Drewko, 2007). Open defecation is linked with the spread of polio and is considered to be one of the important challenges the sanitation and health sector is facing. Other diseases: Diarrhea, typhoid, Intestinal worms (Bartram, et al, 2005). Man-made reservoirs and irrigation schemes, for example, contribute to food security and nutrition. Yet can also be conducive habitats for intensified transmission of disease such as malaria (Bartram, et al, 2005).</li>
                      <li><strong>Unemployment:</strong> For most individuals, basic life requirements are met through employment. However, work does much more than supply the means for meeting physical needs; it also can satisfy creative urges, promote self-esteem, and provide an avenue for achievement and self-realization (Institute for Work and Health, 2009). Conversely, unemployment might be expected to increase anxiety and depression, lead to lower self-esteem, and produce adverse physical health consequences.</li>
                       <li><strong>Standard of living:</strong> Income losses might force the unemployed to reduce their living standards drastically which, of course, could influence both the physical and mental health of unemployed workers. Extent to which the standard of living declines depends on such factors as: the unemployed person's assets; unemployment benefits available; income and assets of other household members; and the duration of unemployment (Institute for Work and Health, 2009).</li>
                        <li><strong>Insecurity of income:</strong> Being unemployed could lead to anxiety about the length of income loss and the risk of a future drop in standard of living. Those who are economically insecure, employed or unemployed, have a lower morale. Becoming unemployed can result in a drop in status among friends and family, and in the community at large. This can lead to a loss of self-esteem (Institute for Work and Health, 2009).</li>
                        <li><strong>Loss of social contacts:</strong> Loss of a job typically means a loss of contact with work colleagues and a shrinking of social networks. That loss of engagement and ‚Äúsocial capital‚Äù can bring about a decline in personal well-being (Institute for Work and Health, 2009). Because they have a lot of free time, sometimes associated with anxiety and depression, the unemployed are more likely than those in employment to abuse drugs (WHO, 2001).</li>
                       <li><strong>Occupational health:</strong> The protection and promotion of the health of workers by preventing and controlling occupational diseases and accidents and by eliminating occupational factors and conditions hazardous to health and safety at work (WHO, 2001).</li>
                        <li>Culture and religion have an influence on beliefs and practices related to health, illness and healing. It includes definitions of health and illness, beliefs about the causes of health and illness. It also involves decisions about whether or not to seek formal health care, and the type of health care provider to be sought (Cohen, 2004).</li>
                       <li><strong>Lifestyle Factors:</strong> Lifestyle is defined as a way of living: the things that a particular person or group of people usually do. Lifestyles are based on individual choices, characteristics, personal preferences and circumstances. Lifestyle includes the behavior and activities that make up your daily life. These include: the work you do, your leisure activities, the food you eat, our interaction with family, friends, neighbours, co-workers and strangers. The major causes of early death have shifted from infectious diseases to chronic lifestyle-related conditions. Behavioural and social issues that impact on health include smoking, alcohol, poor diet, lack of physical exercise, sexual behaviour and drug abuse (Seddon, 2011). Obesity (through poor diet or insufficient exercise): heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes. Alcohol: ill health and premature death, through cirrhosis of the liver, violence, road traffic accidents. Smoking: lung cancer, cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Drugs: have a devastating effect on personal health and circumstances, as well as impacting on family, friends and communities (Seddon, 2011).</li>
                    </ul>
                      <h3>3.5.2 Physical Environment</h3>
                   <p><strong>Potential Health hazards:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                       <li><strong>Air contaminants</strong> (may be inhaled or ingested): Dust, fumes, mist, aerosols. <strong>Chemical hazards:</strong> in the form of solids, liquids, gases, mists, dusts, fumes and vapours exert toxic effects by inhalation, absorption or ingestion. <strong>Biological hazards:</strong> bacteria, viruses and fungi can cause infections by entering the body either directly or through breaks in the skin. This is common in occupations that deal with plants or animals or their products, food and food processing, laboratory and medical personnel (WHO, 2001).</li>
                      <li><strong>Physical hazards:</strong> excessive levels of noise, vibration, illumination and temperature, and electromagnetic radiation. <strong>Psychosocial factors:</strong> includes boring, repetitive tasks, production pressure, stress, low pay and lack of recognition. <strong>Accident factors:</strong> unsafe mechanical and physical conditions, unsafe acts, unsafe personal factors (WHO, 2001). A healthy, productive and well-motivated workforce is the key agent for overall socioeconomic development.</li>
                    </ul>
                  <h3> Health and child development</h3>
                    <p>To reach their full potential, children need high-quality health care and services ‚Äì especially in life's early moments.</p>
                    <p>The time between pregnancy and age 3, when the brain is most susceptible to environmental influences, is critical for a child's growth and development. All children including those with disabilities and developmental delays, those living in poverty or deprivation, and those affected by conflict or displacement ‚Äì need nurturing care and health services to survive and thrive. Because children with developmental delays and disabilities are more likely to be invisible in government statistics, they are often excluded from policy decisions that could improve their well-being. As a result, the quality of the health services they receive can be severely compromised ‚Äì largely due to limited capacity, inadequate training of service providers, or lack of coordination between public authorities and community practitioners.</p>
                   <h3> 3.5.3 Political determinants of health</h3>
                    <p>The Political determinants of health involve the systematic process of structuring relationships, distributing resources, and administering power, operating simultaneously in ways that mutually reinforce or influence one another to shape opportunities that either advance health equity or exacerbate health inequities.</p>
                    <p>The political determinants of health create the social drivers including poor environmental conditions, inadequate transportation, unsafe neighborhoods, and lack of healthy food options - that affect all other dynamics of health. By understanding these determinants, their origins, and their impact on the equitable distribution of opportunities and resources, we can be better equipped to develop and implement actionable solutions to close the health gap.</p>
                    <p>Health is a political choice, and politics is a continuous struggle for power among competing interests. Looking at health through the lens of political determinants means analysing how different power constellations, institutions, processes, interests, and ideological positions affect health within different political systems and cultures and at different levels of governance. Bambra et al provide three arguments why health is political1: health is unevenly distributed, many health determinants are dependent on political action, and health is a critical dimension of human rights and citizenship.</p>
                    <p>Political determinants of health can be split into three categories: voting, government, and policy. For example, voters are who get individual policymakers into government, and therefore give those individuals the power to shape policy. In turn, those policies can impact overall well-being. That policy might be directly related to healthcare‚Äîthe Affordable Care Act or the institution of Medicare or they may have indirect consequences via social determinants of health. Laws granting funds to revamp public transportation, for example, can impact health. If investment in public transportation is concentrated in affluent areas, it could exacerbate health disparities by perpetuating transportation barriers to healthcare.</p>

                <h2>üìö 3.6 Healthy Child Development</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                  <h3>Health Factors in child development</h3>
                     <p>Each child is unique, and while we can be guided by an understanding of some general patterns of development from pre-birth into early childhood, progression is uneven and unfolds differently for each individual child. The complex differences for each child mean the pathways toward maturity should be seen more as dancing around a ballroom than climbing a ladder. A child's growth, development and learning are interrelated in complex ways from the moment of conception all the way through infancy to early childhood and beyond. Experiences during the early years strongly influence a child's future development, as development and learning build on what has already been acquired.</p>
                      <p><strong>Development</strong> is a continuous process which is influenced by many factors. Development refers to the processes through which the body, brain, abilities and behaviour of the infant, child and adult become more complex and continue to mature throughout life. Development involves cognition, memory, attention, language and communication as well as feelings, relationships and sensory-motor skills. Although development is often considered in terms of different aspects, it cannot really be compartmentalised since one domain very often influences the development of other domains. It is important to consider the whole child at the centre of the many influences on development.</p>
                     <p>The baby's brain is not simply a fixed structure which develops in a genetically pre-determined way. It depends on external stimulation from experience to form neurological connections. Babies and children are not passive in the process of development, but are actively stretching their own capacities as they observe and interact with other people, objects and events in the world.</p>

                        <figcaption>Factors which influence development</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                     <ul>
                         <li><strong>Emotional health and wellbeing:</strong> Early relationships strongly influence how children develop, and having close, secure attachment to their carers is important for children's healthy development. Positive relationships support wellbeing and the gradual development of self-regulation. When adults tune in to children's signals and respond sensitively and consistently to meet their needs, children can feel safe, relaxed, and loved. Regular patterns of activities which create routine and help children to know what to expect next also foster a sense of security and self-confidence.</li>
                          <li><strong>Physical health and wellbeing:</strong> Being physically healthy includes having nutritious food, a clean and safe environment, appropriate clothes; healthcare; mental stimulation; movement and activity; rest and sleep; access to the outdoors and loving relationships. Focus on the health and wellbeing of children should be in the ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù and not exclusively on longer-term outcomes. It is important to provide opportunities for children to develop sensory integration, balance and coordination, and large and fine motor skills, through their play indoors and outdoors. Accessibility of all environments for children with complex health conditions or disability should be ensured. Poverty and inequality have an impact on health, wellbeing and life chances.</li>
                           <li><strong>Individual pathways:</strong> Children develop in different ways and rates of development vary from child to child, and from time to time. Each child's unique history, including their experiences and opportunities, is important as the starting point for supporting their development and learning. Many factors, such as low birth weight, child temperament, a recent move or their family being under stress, can also affect a child's development. Emphasis must be on enhancing children's sense of self and on supporting what children can do, rather than focussing on what they cannot yet do.</li>
                          <li><strong>Child as an active learner:</strong> Children are innately driven to become more competent, and they find and embrace the next stages in their development and learning, meeting challenges and practising to develop their skills and independence. The emotional and physical environment should enable and encourage children's agency as they make decisions, take risks and try things out, build their competence and confidence through repetition, and feel satisfaction at their own achievements, as well as accepting what doesn't work.</li>
                          <li><strong>Interactions:</strong> The adult's role as co-regulator is critical in a child's development of self-regulation (children's ability to regulate their thoughts, feelings and behaviour). As they observe and interact with their peers and adults, children gradually move from the experience of being supported in managing their feelings, thoughts and behaviour, to developing the ability to regulate these more independently. Sensitive and skillful adults play a key role in supporting development and learning, through observing children and deciding when to step back and when to offer support, encouragement and stimulation for children's own efforts. Children's language is enriched and enhanced by back-and-forth exchanges with practitioners who respect and respond to children's conversation.</li>
                          <li><strong>Experiences in the world:</strong> Children build on their experiences; the wider and deeper their exposure, the greater potential they have for secure development. Children need opportunities to practise what they know, to consolidate and apply learning from one context to another, and to develop new knowledge and skills. Children will build on experiences in the natural, built and virtual worlds.</li>
                          <li><strong>Culture and Community:</strong> Development and learning are enhanced when there are connections and relationships between early childhood settings, home and other places and spaces in children's lives. Connections across environments support children to bring their interests and "funds of knowledge‚Äù that may provide an anchor for them and an impetus for their learning. Children and families need to feel secure, accepted and that they belong ‚Äì both within and beyond a setting. Diversity of communities must be respected and celebrated, widening each child's sense of belonging and sense of place in the community, while the uniqueness of each family, regardless of differences, is acknowledged and honoured.</li>
