                     <p><strong>A theory:</strong> a plausible or scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena. A supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something, especially one based on general principles independent of the thing to be explained.</p>
                     <p>A theory can also be defined as a -System of ideas intended to explain something, usually based on evidence and assumptions that are generalisable to a population</p>
                     <p><strong>A model is:</strong> Simplified description that can be used to preduct something</p>

                    <h3>a) Health Belief model</h3>
                    <p>Evolved from United States Public Health Service</p>
                    <p>For an individual to change something (usually a behaviour) they would need to have three key beliefs:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>They are susceptible or at risk (perceived susceptibility</li>
                        <li>The health problem is serious (perceived severity)</li>
                        <li>The benefits of taking action outweigh the disadvantages of the health problem (perceived benefits)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Model was expanded to encompass external factors:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The belief that the effort/cost required to overcome perceived barriers is outweighed by the benefits (perceived barriers)</li>
                        <li>A cue to act is seen/received from another external source (mass media, reminder letter, illness of friend or family) (cue to action)</li>
                        <li>The individual believes that they have the ability to successfully take the required action (self- efficacy)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>In order to act, people must believe that the negatives are outweighed by the benefits and they are capable of achieving the desired outcome</p>

                     <p><strong>Example: HBM</strong></p>
                     <p>High blood pressure screening campaigns often identify people who are at high risk for heart disease and stroke, but who say they have not experienced any symptoms. Because they don't feel sick, they may not follow instructions to take prescribed medicine or lose weight. The HBM can be useful for developing strategies to deal with noncompliance in such situations. According to the HBM, asymptomatic people may not follow a prescribed treatment regimen unless they accept that, though they have no symptoms, they do in fact have hypertension (perceived susceptibility). They must understand that hypertension can lead to heart attacks and strokes (perceived severity).</p>
                     <p>Taking prescribed medication or following a recommended weight loss program will reduce the risks (perceived benefits) without negative side effects or excessive difficulty (perceived barriers). Print materials, reminder letters, or pill calendars might encourage people to consistently follow their doctors' recommendations (cues to action). For those who have, in the past, had a hard time losing weight or maintaining weight loss, a behavioral contract might help establish achievable, short-term goals to build confidence (self-efficacy).</p>

                      <p><strong>Example: Trans-theoretical mode</strong></p>
                      <p>A company hires a health educator to plan a smoking cessation program for its employees who smoke (200 people). The health educator decides to offer group smoking cessation clinics to employees at various times and locations. Several months pass, however, and only 50 of the smokers sign up for the clinics. At this point, the health educator faces a dilemma: how can the 150 smokers who are not participating in the clinics be reached?</p>
                      <p>The Stages of Change Model offers perspective on ways to approach this problem.</p>
                      <p>First, the model can be employed to help understand and explain why they are not attending the clinics. Second, it can be used to develop a comprehensive smoking program to help more current and former smokers change their smoking behavior, and maintain that change.</p>
                      <p>By asking a few simple questions, the health educator can assess what stages of contemplation potential program participants are in.</p>
                      <p>E.g; Are you interested in trying to quit smoking? (Pre-contemplation). Are you thinking about quitting smoking soon? (Contemplation). Are you ready to plan how you will quit smoking? (Preparation). Are you in the process of trying to quit smoking? (Action). Are you trying to stay smoke-free? (Maintenance). The employees' responses will help to pinpoint where the participants are on the continuum of change, and to tailor messages, strategies, and programs appropriate to their needs.</p>
                      <p>E.g, Individuals who enjoy smoking are not interested in trying to quit, and therefore will not attend a smoking cessation clinic; For them, a more appropriate intervention might include educational interventions designed to move them out of the ‚Äúpre-contemplation" stage and into ‚Äúcontemplation‚Äù (e.g., using carbon monoxide testing to demonstrate the effect of smoking on health). On the other hand, individuals who are ready to plan how to quit smoking (the "preparation" stage) can be encouraged to do so, and moved to the next stage, ‚Äúaction.‚Äù</p>

                      <p>Health advisors create contracts with participants, setting incremental goals (self-efficacy). Respected congregation members serve as role models (observational learning). Participants receive T-shirts, recipe books, and other incentives, and are taught to reward themselves by making time to relax (reinforcement).

                     <p><strong>Example: Diffusion of Innovations</strong></p>
                      <p>A university designs a program to help primary school children cultivate healthy lifestyle habits and avoid chronic disease. The program has many components: it addresses the foods that children eat by modifying the fat and sugar content of school lunches, it teaches important health information through a classroom-based health education curriculum, and it encourages physical activity through a physical education component.</p>
                      <p>It is highly successful; follow-up studies show that children who went through the program in primary school continue to have healthier habits in their adolescence than those who did not go through the program. The fact that the program is successful is not enough to ensure it will change primary school practices. To achieve a broader impact, the program must diffuse to other sites.</p>
                      <p>Program planners may seek to demonstrate the <strong>relative advantage</strong> of the program by emphasizing its positive outcomes. They may try to show its <strong>compatibility</strong> by demonstrating that state policy-makers (e.g., the Ministry of Education) have approved its materials. The program's <strong>complexity</strong> can be limited by creating user-friendly materials for teachers and cafeteria workers. By making the materials available on a Web site, they can enhance its <strong>trialability</strong>. Professional demonstrations of the program components can create an element of <strong>observability</strong></p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>PRECEDE-PROCEED can be thought of as a road map and behavior change theories as the specific directions to a destination.</p>
                    <p>The PRECEDE acronym stands for: Predisposing, Reinforcing, and Enabling Constructs in Educational/Environmental Diagnosis and Evaluation. PRECEDE is based on the premise that, just as medical diagnosis precedes a treatment plan, so should educational diagnosis precede an intervention plan.</p>
                    <p>The PROCEED acronym stands for: Policy, Regulatory, and Organizational Constructs in Educational and Environmental Development. Recognizes the importance of environmental factors as determinants of health and health behaviors.</p>
                    <h3>Application of PROCEED & PRECEDE Models</h3>
                    <p>During the diagnostic steps (5 steps) of the model, practitioners employ various methods to learn about the community's perceived and actual needs, as well as the regulatory context in which the intervention will operate.</p>
                     <h4>Step 1; To conduct social assessment</h4>
                     <p>the practitioner may use multiple data collection activities (e.g., key informant interviews, focus groups, participant observation, surveys) to understand the community's perceived needs.</p>
                     <h4>Step 2; Epidemiological assessment</h4>
                     <p>may include secondary data analysis or original data collection to prioritize the community's health needs and establish program goals and objectives.</p>
                     <h4>Step 3; Behavioral and Environmental Assessment</h4>
                     <p>identifies factors, both internal and external to the individual, that affect the health problem. Reviewing the literature and applying theory are two ways to map out these factors.</p>
                     <h4>Step 4; In Educational and Ecological Assessment</h4>
                     <p>the practitioner identifies antecedent/precursor/forerunner and reinforcing factors that must be in place to initiate and sustain change.</p>
                     <p>Behavior, e.g. reducing intake of dietary fat, engaging in routine physical activity, and obtaining annual mammograms, is shaped by predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling factors.</p>
                     <p>Practitioners can use individual, interpersonal, or community-level change theories to classify determinants of behavior into one of these three categories and rank their importance.</p>
                     <p>Because each type of factor requires different intervention strategies, classifying them helps practitioners consider how to address community needs.</p>
                     <p>The three types of influencing factors include:</p>
                     <ol type="i">
                         <li><strong>Predisposing factors</strong>, which motivate or provide a reason for behavior; they include knowledge, attitudes, cultural beliefs, and readiness to change.</li>
                         <li><strong>Enabling factors</strong>, which enable persons to act on their predispositions; these factors include available resources, supportive policies, assistance, and services.</li>
                         <li><strong>Reinforcing factors</strong>, which come into play after a behavior has been initiated; they encourage repetition or persistence of behaviors by providing continuing rewards or incentives. Social support, praise, reassurance, and symptom relief might all be considered reinforcing factors.</li>
                     </ol>
                     <h4>Step 5; In the final diagnostic step of PRECEDE-PROCEED model, Administrative and Policy Assessment</h4>
                     <p>intervention strategies reflect information gathered in previous steps; the availability of needed resources; and organizational policies and regulations that could affect program implementation.</p>

                     <p>Before <strong>Implementation (Step 6)</strong> begins, practitioners should prepare plans for <strong>evaluating the process (Step 7)</strong>, <strong>evaluating the impact (Step 8)</strong>, and <strong>evaluating the outcome (Step 9)</strong> of the intervention.</p>
                     <h4>Step 7: Process Evaluation</h4>

                     <h4>Step 8: Impact Evaluation</h4>
                     <p>looks at changes in factors (i.e., predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors) that influence the likelihood that behavioral and environmental change will occur.</p>
                     <h4>Step 9: Lastly, outcome evaluation</h4>
