                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Social Mobilisation is a process whereby people are organised in order to enable them to collectively think and act upon their development. Social Mobilisation consists of the organising of communities in rural and peri-urban area.</p>
                    <p>Its about society you and me; Its about people taking action with the objective of making a change for a common good. Health promotion is a social process and so is social mobilization.</p>
                    <p>Social mobilization is the primary step of community development for recovery from conflicts and disasters. It allows people to think and understand their situation and to organize and initiate action for their recovery with their own initiative and creativity. Through mobilization, people can organize themselves to take action collectively by developing their own plan and strategy for recovery rather than being imposed from outside</p>
                    <p>Social mobilization is an important means to advance sustainable development policy by making it more responsive and accountable to people's needs and demands.</p>
                     <h3>Steps involved in developing an Advocacy Communication and Social Mobilization Campaign (ACSM)</h3>
                     <h4>STEP 1: Situation analysis</h4>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Analyze in detail the causes/reasons for a program challenge, for example, poor case detection.</li>
                         <li>There could be several possible reasons, such as:
                             <ol>
                                 <li>Lack of awareness</li>
                                 <li>Poor knowledge of TB symptoms</li>
                                 <li>Poor risk perception</li>
                                 <li>Misconceptions about costs</li>
                                 <li>Faith in non-DOTS treatment</li>
                                 <li>No nearby testing facility</li>
                             </ol>
                         </li>
                     </ul>
                     <h4>STEP 2: Audience segmentation, prioritizing, and profiling</h4>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Segmenting divides and organizes populations into smaller groups or audiences with similar communication-related needs, preferences, and characteristics.</li>
                         <li>Prioritizing helps to determine what audiences we should focus on.</li>
                         <li>Profiling or describing allows us to imagine what the audience looks like and what its communication needs could be by personalizing audience members.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <h4>STEP 3: Developing ACSM objectives</h4>
                     <p>Once situational analysis and audience segmentation has been completed, developing and defining communication objectives will provide direction and answers to the following questions:</p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>What do we want our audience/target group to change?</li>
                         <li>Why is it not already happening (that is, what are the barriers)?</li>
                         <li>Which of the barriers will be addressed by communication?</li>
                     </ul>
                     <h4>STEP 4: Defining the strategic approach</h4>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Now is the time to decide on the approach that needs to be followed to reach the intended audience and effectively address program challenge(s).</li>
                         <li>Make a decision on whether advocacy will be more appropriate or use of mass media/mid-media channels of communication will be more cost effective or social/community mobilization will better address program issues.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <h4>STEP 5: Selection of channels</h4>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Having identified the reasons and target audiences for ACSM intervention, we need to select the most appropriate and cost-effective media/channels of communication to reach the audience with the communication messages.</li>
                         <li>Addressing each of the program challenges requires different audiences to be targeted with appropriate messages, using an appropriate approach and appropriate channels of communication.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <h4>STEP 6: Creating and messaging</h4>
                     <ul>
                         <li>A scientific approach should be employed in creation and design of communication messages.</li>
                         <li>Ensure that communication messages are developed with initial concept testing, message designing, and pre-testing.</li>
                         <li>All these processes and steps involve proper research to address the actual need of the population.</li>
                         <li>All the important principles of communication should be followed while designing communication messages.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <h4>STEP 7: ACSM implementation</h4>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Quality implementation of ACSM activities requires preparedness and attention to all aspects/arrangements. Every planned activity requires preparation and arrangement before.</li>
                     </ul>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Capacity building is a name for the familiar concepts of community and workforce development. Capacity building taps into existing abilities of individuals, communities, organisations or systems to increase involvement, decision-making and ownership of issues. In a health promotion context, the notion of capacity building stems from the recognition that strategies can be more effective and sustainable if the effort extends beyond traditional health sector boundaries. The benefits are clear. By working across sectors, there is potential to build individual skills, strengthen community action, and empower organisations to promote sustainable health behaviours and support healthy environments. Capacity building incorporates advocacy and relies on partnerships.</p>
                    <p>Capacity building can start from the inside with the individual and then spread through the community and organisational levels to the outer systems level.</p>
