                <h2>üìö 5.3 Medical Approach</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                     <p>The medical or preventive approach aims to reduce premature death by targeting the whole population or groups who are at higher risk of developing disease. This approach can operate at three levels (Naidoo and Wills, 2009):</p>
                     <p><strong>a) Primary prevention ‚Äì preventing the onset of disease</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Immunization of children √† preventing illnesses.</li>
                         <li>The analysis of questionnaires about health behaviour could also be useful in helping people to adopt a healthy lifestyle.</li>
                         <li>Safe and reasonable nutrition</li>
                         <li>Weight control</li>
                         <li>Physical activities</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p><strong>b) Secondary prevention ‚ÄìPreventing progression of diseases through early detection and diagnosis to have on time treatment/ intervention:</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Mamography to detect breast cancer.</li>
                         <li>Health education program to help women</li>
                         <li>do Breast Self-sxamination to detect breast cancer</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p><strong>c) Tertiary prevention level ‚Äì Preventing further disability or suffering in those already ill.</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>Examples:</strong> rehabilitation, patient education, palliative care developed disease.</p>

                <h2>üìö 5.4 Behavior change approach-positive deviance approach</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The behavioral approach, also known as the behavior change approach, makes the fundamental assumption that healthy lifestyles are crucial to maintaining good health. Healthcare professionals who adopt the behavioral approach in their practice seek to provide individual patients with information concerning their unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and motivate them to change.</p>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> to encourage people to adopt healthy behaviors</p>
                    <p>It views health as property of individual's i.e it is people's responsibilities to take action and look after themselves.</p>
                    <p><strong>Methods:</strong> programs for individuals and public:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Communication</li>
                        <li>Education</li>
                        <li>Persuasion, motivation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Criticisms of the behavior change approach</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Health related decision is very complex</li>
                        <li>Depend on person's readiness to take action</li>
                        <li>Complex relationship between health behaviors and social and economic factors</li>
                        <li>Is unable to target the major socio-economic causes of ill health;</li>
                        <li>Operates top-down;</li>
                        <li>Assumes that there is a direct link between knowledge, attitudes and behaviour;</li>
                        <li>Assumes homogeneity among the receivers</li>
                    </ul>
                     <p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Behavior change after the intervention.</p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>The behavior change is only apparent after a long time.</li>
                         <li>Difficult to isolate any behavior change as attributable to a health promotion intervention.</li>

                <h2>üìö 5.5 Peer to peer approach</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>A young person's peer group has a great influence on the way he or she behaves. This is true of both risky and safe behaviour. Peer education thus makes use of peer influence ‚Äì in a positive way.</p>
                    <p>As peer-led interventions are based on the assumption that behaviour is socially influenced and that behavioural norms are developed through interaction, this form of intervention can be advocated to promote more positive health behaviour amongst youth.</p>
                    <p>The credibility of peer educators in the eyes of their target group is indeed an important base upon which peer education can be built.</p>
                    <p>The process of peer education is perceived as receiving advice from a friend ‚Äòin the know', who has similar concerns and can identify with an understanding of what it is like to be a young person. In addition, peer education is also a way to empower young people; it offers them the opportunity to participate in activities that affect them and to access the information and services that they need to protect their health.</p>

                <h2>üìö 5.6 Child to Child (Ctc) Approach</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The CtC approach to health education was first introduced in 1978 by David Morley, following the Alma Ata Declaration on Primary Health care and in preparation for the International Year of the Child.</p>
                    <p>The underlying premise of the approach is that children, if given the opportunity, can make important contributions to the health and well-being of themselves and others.</p>
                    <p>It was developed as a way for school-aged children to learn about and pass on basic health messages to their peers and younger siblings.</p>
                    <p>Child-to-Child (CtC) projects involve children in activities that interest, challenge and empower them. In so doing, the approach "encourages and enables children to play an active and responsible role in the health and development of themselves, other children, their families and communities".</p>
                     <h3>5.7 Pillars to Child-to-child</h3>
                     <p>They are two:</p>
                     <ol>
                         <li>Popular education and</li>
                         <li>Child participation.</li>
                     </ol>
                     <h4>Popular education</h4>
                     <p>Popular education, or education for social change, is one of the key theoretical pillars underlying the CtC approach.</p>
                     <p>Popular education is about people learning from one another. It is based on learners' concerns and involves them in choosing what and how to learn. It is an educational model in which there are no "experts" and everyone teaches and everyone learns.</p>
                     <p>The approach begins by drawing out children's experiences and looking for shared patterns of experience and knowledge.</p>
                     <p>New information and ideas are then explored and integrated.</p>
                     <p>Children practice various life skills (e.g. decision making, communication, and team work), plan for and take action and then reflect on what they have learned and how things have changed as a result of their work. In this way, the CtC approach facilitates children's empowerment and inclusion in efforts to make a difference in the world around them</p>
                     <h4>Child participation</h4>
                     <p>It is the second theoretical pillar of the CtC approach. In its broadest sense, child participation refers to children playing a meaningful role in the world around them.</p>
                     <p>The principle of child participation is firmly rooted in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which asserts that children have the right to participate as full members of society. In short, the CRC recognises that children are not merely "adults in training", but people who are able to form and express opinions, to participate in decision-making processes and to influence solutions.</p>
                     <p>This recognition that children have the right to be involved in decisions that affect them means that community development programmes need to learn from and engage with children on issues of concern to them. This process involves children identifying problems in their community and working to solve them. This view that children have a valuable contribution to make to the improvement of their communities underlies the CtC approach.</p>
                      <h4>Six steps of Child-to-Child approach</h4>
                      <ol>
                          <li><strong>Step 1: Group Work:</strong> This step is designed to lay the foundation on which the rest of the project will be built. This step is about: getting to know each other, understanding what the project is all about, having fun!, sharing feelings, group work, listening skills, getting comfortable with the CtC process</li>
                           <li><strong>Step 2: Our ideas:</strong> The purpose of this step is to provide children with an opportunity to say what they think are key issues of concern in their community. This step is about: Children voicing their concerns, Getting out all the children's ideas about a particular topic, Having fun!</li>
                           <li><strong>Step 3: Choose an Issue:</strong> In this step the children need to decide which of the many issues they raised is the most important. This step is about: Children working together to choose an issue that they want to address, Children discussing their views with each other, Having fun!</li>
                           <li><strong>Step 4: Find Out More:</strong> It's important that the children are able to base their action on the best information they can get hold of. This step is about: Planning what and how to find out more about the selected issue</li>
                           <li><strong>Step 5: Plan and Take Action:</strong> Using the information gathered in step four, the children plan their action/s to address the issue of concern. Then they make it happen, either by communicating health messages or by taking direct action. This step is about: Planning an action (or series of actions), Taking action, Having fun!</li>
                           <li><strong>Step 6: Think it Over:</strong> This step is designed to provide the children with an opportunity: to reflect on what they did; and to evaluate what they were able to achieve, what they liked and what they would improve if they were to do it again. This step is about: Reflecting on the project, Evaluating the activities and the impact of the work, Having fun!</li>

                <h2>üìö 5.8 Educational approach</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The educational approach to health promotion assumes that increasing people's knowledge about their health will lead to healthier behaviour. Health workers who adopt an educational approach provide people with knowledge and information about their health. This differs from the behaviour change approach in that it does not seek to attempt to motivate theindividual to change their behaviour in a specific direction decided by the professional, for example, to quit smoking, reduce alcohol intake or consume more fruit and vegetables. The focus of the educational approach is on learning and comprises three aspects (Bloom et al., 1956):</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Cognitive - addresses people's understanding concerning a health topic.</li>
                        <li>Affective - considers an individual's feelings and attitudes towards a health topic.</li>
                         <li>Behavioural - concerned with people's skills, for example, their ability to cook.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <p>One important outcome of the educational approach is ‚Äòhealth literacy', which refers to ‚Äúthe personal, cognitive and social skills which determine the ability of individuals to gain access to, understand and use information to promote and maintain good health‚Äù (Nutbeam, 2000, p. 263).</p>

             <section class="content-section">
                <h2>üìö 5.9 Empowerment or client centered approach</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Within the context of health promotion, empowerment can be understood as ‚Äúa process through which people gain greater control over decisions and actions affecting their health‚Äù (WHO, 1998, p. 6). An empowerment approach seeks to enable individuals and social groups to express their health-related needs and have greater involvement in decision-making regarding their health. It can be used when working directly with individual patients or whole communities.</p>
                    <p>One example of the empowerment approach being used to successfully promote patient health has been demonstrated within a hospice setting that specialises in cancer care (Simons, 2016). By improving open dialogue with patients and their families, nursing staff were able to elicit expressed needs and subsequently develop patient-centred care plans that promoted patients' autonomy. Despite the lack of financial resources, limited staff training and time pressures within the hospice, it was found that staff were able to make improvements to patients' physical and mental health through effective communication and small gestures demonstrating empathic care. These improvements included improved oral hygiene and increased access to creative activities that were designed to improve psychological wellbeing, such as spending time in the garden.</p>

                <h2>üìö 5.10 Societal/social change approach</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The social change approach focuses on making changes to the physical, social and economic environment to increase their health promoting capacity. This approach assumes that that if the healthier choice is made the easier choice, it will become increasingly realistic for individuals to make decisions to improve their health and wellbeing. Therefore, health promotion is ‚Äòa social and political process' that regards health as a human right and considers the maintenance of population health to be a prerequisite for social progress.</p>
