                <div class="content-block">
                   <p>The term "health promotion" (HP) refers to a broad social and political process that includes both actions intended to improve people's abilities and skills and actions intended to alter social, environmental, and economic conditions in order to lessen their negative effects on both public and individual health. The purpose of HP practice is to create and sustain environments that enable individuals to make healthy decisions and promote social contexts that support healthy behaviors.</p>

                        <figcaption>The Health Promotion Logo</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                      <p>This logo was established in 1986 during the First International Conference on Health Promotion in Ottawa, Canada. WHO has used this symbol as the Health Promotion logo ever since.</p>

<p>The logo is a circle with three wings. It includes five main HP action areas: establishing supportive settings for health, increasing community action for health, developing personal skills, and re-orienting health services, as well as three fundamental HP strategies: empower, mediate, and advocate.</p>
<p>The basic visual features of the HP logo are: one outer circle, one round place within the circle, and three wings that emerge from this inner spot, one of which breaks the outside circle.</p>
     <ul>
         <li>The outer circle, which was originally red, symbolizes the necessity for policies to "hold things together" and the objective of "Building Healthy Public Policies". The three wings are encompassed by a circle, signifying the necessity of addressing each of the five major action areas for health promotion listed in the Ottawa Charter in a coordinated and complementary way.</li>
          <li>The circular region within the circle represents the three fundamental HP strategies‚Äîenabling, mediating, and advocacy‚Äîwhich are essential and used in all fields of health promotion work.</li>
          <li>The Jakarta Declaration (1997) on Leading Health Promotion into the 21st Century, which was reiterated in the Ottawa Charter (1986), depicts (and contains the wording of) the three wings as representing (and containing) the five major action areas for health promotion.</li>
     </ul>
<p>The logo conveys the impression that Health Promotion employs a thorough, multi-pronged approach in its entirety. One of the prerequisites "for HP to be effective" (Jakarta Declaration 1997) is HP's integration of many strategies and methodologies. HP offers a complete and cogent response to the Ottawa Charter's core action areas.</p>

                <h2>üìö 1.4 Terminologies Used in Health Promotion</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                   <p><strong>Health:</strong> Health was defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1947 as ‚Äúa state of complete physical, mental and social well-being not merely the absence of disease or infirmity‚Äù. In 1998, the definition was updated to emphasize social and personal resources, plus physical capabilities. However, the original definition still holds true today. Within the context of health promotion (HP); it has been considered less an abstract state and more as a means to an end. In this sense, it is a resource for everyday life, not the object of living. It is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources as well as physical capabilities. (Adapted from the Ottawa Charter for HP.)</p>
                   <p><strong>Health promotion:</strong> The Ottawa Charter (1986) has defined Health promotion (HP) as, ‚Äúthe process of enabling people to increase control over the determinants of health and thereby improve their health‚Äù. Other definitions of HP include: a comprehensive social and political process; a set of tools for health action; a means of increasing individual and collective participation/involvement in health action; a social and just investment. Health promotion is any combination of health education with appropriate legal, fiscal, economic, environmental and organizational interventions in programs to achieve health and prevent disease (Health Promotion: A Strategy for the African Region-WHO).</p>
                   <p><strong>Advocacy:</strong> A combination of individual and social actions designed to gain political commitment, policy support, social acceptance and systems support for a particular health goal or program. It involves collecting and structuring information into a persuasive case; communicating the case to decision-makers and other potential supporters, including the public and consumers, through various interpersonal and media channels; and stimulating actions by social institutions, stakeholders and policy-makers in support of the goal or program. Advocacy is a continuous and adaptive process of gathering, organizing and formulating information into arguments to be communicated through various interpersonal and media channels, with a view to raising resources or gaining political and social leadership acceptance and commitment for development. It is speaking up for the voiceless.</p>
                   <p><strong>Enablement:</strong> Enablement is a way of working with others in a participative manner. It is a process that encourages people to reflect on their own experiences and facilitates a process of learning and skills-building, which people can apply to their everyday lives. The Ottawa Charter links enablement with equity (or fairness) in health. e.g., if we develop capacity or increase the skills of individuals or groups, be they health workers or members of the community, they will have more power to control the factors that determine their health.</p>
                   <p><strong>Mediation:</strong> Aims at reconciling competing interests in society so as to create conditions that support health. In human society, the socioeconomic environment usually gives rise to competing goals. Therefore, mediation to tackle those aims that hinder health improvement is necessary in many communities. A case in point is where people grow tobacco as a commercial commodity in spite of tobacco's role in causing disease and death. To balance the damage due to tobacco with its trade gains, governments, in most cases with support from civil society organizations and dedicated individuals, pass legislation and policies that protect people who do not wish to use tobacco from its harmful effects.</p>
                     <p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> A recognized relationship among different sectors or groups, which has been formed to take action on an issue in a way that is more effective or sustainable than might be achieved by one sector or group acting alone.</p>
                     <p><strong>Coordination:</strong> Establishing linkages with different players in HP. Coordination aims at placing clients at the center of service delivery. It ensures that they have access to the services they need, opportunities for early intervention and HP for improved health outcomes. The practice of service coordination particularly supports more effective ways of working with people with complex and multiple needs.</p>
                     <p><strong>Participation:</strong> Participation means the involvement of the people concerned in analysis, decision-making, planning, and program implementation, monitoring and evaluation. While the opportunities for community participation may vary greatly from place to place, a participatory approach to health-related activities should be promoted to achieve sustainable development.</p>
                    <p><strong>Partnership:</strong> A partnership is an arrangement in which parties agree to cooperate to advance their mutual interests. Since humans are social beings, partnerships between individuals, businesses, interest-based organizations, schools, governments, and varied combinations thereof, have always been and remain commonplace. Partners have agreed upon mission, values, goals, measurable outcomes and accountability for the partnership. The relationship between partners is characterized by mutual trust, respect, genuineness, and commitment.</p>
                   <p><strong>Inclusiveness:</strong> Inclusion in HP will provide the impetus to bring partners together around the common goal of improving the health outcomes of some of the most vulnerable members of our society, and act as a constant reminder that everyone should have access to the highest standard of care, no matter what their circumstances.</p>
                   <p><strong>Empowerment:</strong> A process of facilitating and enabling people to acquire skills, knowledge and confidence to make responsible choices and implement them. It helps create settings and facilitate autonomous functioning.</p>
                    <p><strong>Innovation:</strong> Innovations are new products, programs, ideas or practices that are implemented, adopted or disseminated within groups, organizations or networks. It is about doing things differently. The incorporation of innovation is often discussed in terms of the ‚ÄúDiffusion of Innovations‚Äù theory, which focuses on the qualities that make an innovation successful, how well it is accepted by peer networks and having an understanding of how different end users use the innovation.</p>
                   <p><strong>Democratization of Knowledge:</strong> The acquisition and dissemination of information among a broader segment of the people, rather than only privileged elites such as clergy and academics, is referred to as democratization of knowledge.</p>

                <h2>üìö 1.7 Historical Background of Health Promotion</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                 <h3>1.7.1 The early civilization</h3>
                    <p>The early civilization is the starting point for research into the history of health promotion and education. The writings of the Babylonians, Egyptians, and the Old Testament reveal the use of a variety of health promotion strategies in connection to food, shelter, water, and safety. There were mechanisms in place in the neighborhood to collect rainwater or supply clean water. The usage of earth closets was one of several sewage disposal techniques. Personal hygiene was encouraged. It was acknowledged that intoxication was problematic. Numerous dietary restrictions and different hygienic regulations restricted food production and supply. Exercise was advocated. In some settings building regulations were set, and garbage removal and street cleaning began to occur regularly. Mental Health and spiritual health were advocated.</p>

                    <p>The majority of Early Civilizations merged health and religion. Many of the early hospitals and practitioners of the healing arts were supported by organized religion. The early temples were also the first hospitals in various cultures. In the history of medicine, health promotion, and health education, religious practitioners' desire to enhance the health and well-being of others has been a major factor.</p>

                   <p>Histories of public health reveal that cultures have always employed some type of collective public health initiatives, even if they were not labeled as health promotion.Here are several examples: The public Roman baths, Roman regulations controlling the burial of the dead as well as the regulation of harmful animals and defective commodities, Prostitution was regulated in Ancient Rome and Greece, Smallpox vaccinations in India and China prior to the Christian period, People with leprosy were isolated in Europe during the middle Ages and The Venetians' quarantining of ships.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                  <p>The industrial revolution, which lasted from around 1760 to sporadically between 1820 and 1840, is where the foundations of today's health promotion initiatives are found. Due to the development of enormous industries, thousands of people were forced to work at congested, dangerous locations in congested, unsafe cities.</p>

                   <p>Technology and research have significantly influenced prevention by enabling us to comprehend the causal roles of pathogens and the effectiveness of immunization. Similar to how the development and advancement of preventative programs were influenced by the discovery of the impact of food, exercise, and drug misuse on chronic illness.</p>
                   <p>In Northern Europe, the Industrial revolution (late 18th century in Britain), resulted in massive changes in population patterns and in the physical environment in which people lived.In the United Kingdom, the poor's overcrowded and unclean living circumstances, along with the increase of typhoid and cholera as major causes of mortality, put pressure on the government to enact changes or legislation to enhance public health. In 1842, Edwin Chadwick, who was in charge of heading a "Health of Towns commission" and lobbying for the first public health reforms, proposed that impoverished people's bad health was caused by inadequate housing, sanitation, and filthy water. The 1848 Public Health Act was the outcome of their efforts.</p>
                   <p>Around this period (1854), John Snow, one of the earliest epidemiologists, was involved in the now-famous episode. Snow tracked an epidemic to a water pump in Broad Street, Soho, and London, proving that cholera was a watery illness. The epidemic was terminated when the water pump was not used. Experiences like this and public health regulations prompted local administrations to employ medical officers to uphold public health legislation and provide advice on suitable remedies.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                  <p>At the end of the nineteenth century, the emphasis on improving environmental and social circumstances to avoid illness was eclipsed by the growing popularity and investment in medical (or curative) approaches to illness. However, activism, protest, and questioning the status quo or existing circumstances were characteristics of the social atmosphere of the 1960s and 1970s. Additionally, the early 1970s saw a crisis in the expense of healthcare in many nations. People started to realize that while medicine could be effective in treating short-term ailments like TB or pneumonia, it did not seem to have much to offer in treating chronic diseases like cancer. There was still no cure for the sickness, and cancer rates remained the same. As a result, it looked that the value or returns from the investment in medical technology were declining. Thomas McKeown's (1976) major hypothesis or theory reaffirmed the significance of non-medical variables in enhancing community health in industrialized countries.</p>
                   <p>Thomas McKeown, a physician and demographic historian, advanced the theory in the body of knowledge that the improvement in general standards of living‚Äîespecially diet and nutrition status-resulting from better economic conditions, rather than life-saving advances in the fields of medicine or public health, was responsible for the growth in population in the industrial world from the late 1700s to the present. Many researchers' questions and research hypotheses were influenced by "The McKeown thesis," which also gave rise to a protracted debate.</p>

                    <p>The thirty-first World Health Assembly decided in 1977 that the primary health-related goal of governments and the World Health Organization in the coming decades should be to ensure that all people around the world achieve a level of health that allows them to lead socially and economically productive lives. By the year 2000, this had become known as the Global Strategy for Health for All (HFA, 2000). The awareness that the major determinants of health were beyond the health sector--food, water, sanitation, housing, employment, and so on--was a significant aspect of HFA 2000.</p>
