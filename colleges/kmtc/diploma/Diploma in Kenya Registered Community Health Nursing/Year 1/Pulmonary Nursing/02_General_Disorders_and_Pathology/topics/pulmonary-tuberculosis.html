                        <p>Tuberculosis (abbreviated as TB for tubercle bacillus or Tuberculosis) is a common and often deadly infectious disease caused by mycobacteria, mainly Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculosis usually attacks the lungs (as pulmonary TB) but can also affect the central nervous system, the lymphatic system, the circulatory system, the genitourinary system, the gastrointestinal system, bones, joints, and even the skin. Other mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium canetti, and Mycobacterium microti also cause tuberculosis, but these species are less</p>
                        <p>Pulmonary tuberculosis is a chronic communicable lung disease, which is the classical and most common example of chronic infection of the lung. Tuberculosis is made distinctive by a necrotizing (caseating) granulomatous tissue response to seeded organisms (it exhibits a granulomatous inflammation).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.0 EPIDEMIOLOGY</h3>
                        <p>World Health Organization (WHO)estimates that nearly 2 billion people (one third of the world's population) have been exposed to the tuberculosis pathogen and annually, 8 million people become ill with tuberculosis and 2 million people die from the disease worldwide. In 2004, around 14.6 million people had active TB disease with 9 million new cases. Tuberculosis is the world's greatest infectious killer of women of reproductive age and the leading cause of death among people with HIV/.</p>
                        <p>The rise in HIV infections and the neglect of TB control programs have enabled a resurgence of tuberculosis with the emergence of drug-resistant strains also contributing to this new epidemic with, from 2000 to 2004, 20% of TB cases being resistant to standard treatments and 2% resistant to second-line drugs.The rate at which new TB cases occur varies widely, even in neighboring countries, apparently because of differences in health care systems.</p>
                        <p>The incidence of TB varies with age. In Africa, TB primarily affects adolescents and young adults; however, in developed TB is mainly a disease of older people, or of the immunocompromised.</p>

                        <p>The tuberculous bacilli or Koch's bacilli discovered by Robert Koch in 1882 cause tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes tuberculosis in the lungs and other tissues of the human body. The organism is a strict aerobe that thrives best in high oxygen tension areas like the apex of the lung. Mycobacteria are acid-fast, slender rod, aerobic, non-motile, non-capsulated and non-sporing organisms</p>
                        <p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a species of the genus mycobacterium, family mycobacteriaceae, non-sporulating, aerobic acid-fast rods. They have slow growth with the colonies being opaque, dry, off-white to cream coloured at an optimal temperature of 37°C. Because the tubercle bacillus has a capsule composed of waxes and fatty substances, it is more resistant to destruction than many other organisms.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Introduction</h4>
                        <p>People suffering from active pulmonary TB cough, sneeze, speak, or spit, expelling infectious aerosol droplets 0.5 to 5 µm in diameter. A single sneeze can release up to 40,000 droplets. Each one of these droplets may transmit the disease, since the infectious dose of tuberculosis is very low and the inhalation of just a single bacterium can cause a new infection.</p>
                        <p>People with prolonged, frequent, or intense contact are at particularly high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated 22% infection rate. A person with active but untreated tuberculosis can infect 10-15 other people per year. Others at risk include people in areas where TB is common, people who inject drugs using unsanitary needles, residents and employees of high-risk congregate settings, medically under-served and low-income populations, high-risk racial or ethnic minority populations, children exposed to adults in high-risk categories, patients immunocompromised by conditions such as HIV/AIDS, people who take immunosuppressant drugs, and health care workers serving these high-risk clients.</p>
                        <p>Transmission can only occur from people with active (not latent) TBand the probability of transmission from one person to another depends upon the number of infectious droplets expelled by a carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, and the virulence of the M. tuberculosisstrain.</p>
                        <p>The chain of transmission can, therefore, be broken by isolating patients with active disease and starting effective anti-tuberculous therapy. After two weeks of such treatment, people with non-resistant active TB generally cease to be contagious. If someone does become infected, then it will take at least 21 days, or three to four weeks, before the newly infected person can transmit the disease to others. TB can also be transmitted by eating meat infected with TB. Mycobacterium bovis causes TB in cattle. (See details below.)</p>

                                <p>Majority of patients acquire the infection through inhalation of airborne infected droplets derived from the sputum of an adult with cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis produced by the coughing or sneezing of infected individuals</p>

                        <p>Immunity in tuberculosis may be either natural or acquired. Acquired immunity is intimately associated with development of allergy (hypersensitivity). Hypersensitivity (allergy) and immunity play as significant role in development of lesion in tuberculosis.</p>
                        <p>The tubercle bacilli do not produce anti toxins and tissue changes seen in tuberculosis are because of host response to the organism, which leads to development of cell-mediated hypersensitivity (type IV) and immunity. These responses are due to the presence of several lipids such as mycosides and glycoproteins.Myosides are essential for growth and virulence of the organism in the animals and glycosides, which are present in the mycobacterium wall act as adjuvant acting along with tuberculoproteins.</p>
                        <p>The basic tissue elements responsible for immunity are the macrophages which phagoctose and destroy tubercle bacilli and caseous necrosis in which the bacilli are destroyed in large numbers. This is because the macrophages take part in chemical mechanisms involved in cellular immunity.</p>
                        <p>Tissue reaction to tubercle bacilli varies in healthy individuals (primary infection) and previous infected individuals (secondary infection). In primary infection, introduction of tubercle bacilli into the skin evokes no visible reaction for 10-14 days. After this period, a node develops at the inoculation site. This eventually ulcerates and heals. The regional lymph nodes develop tubercles, which is a manifestation of delayed hypersensitivity reaction. In secondary infection, the tubercle bacilli are injected into the skin and in 1-2 days the inoculation site is indurated and dark attaining a diameter of one cm. the skin lesion ulcerates and heals quickly and the regional lymph nodes are not affected (Koch's phenomenon).</p>
                        <p>Hypersensitivity and immunity responses are initiated by T lymphocytes sensitized against specific antigens in tuberculin. Because of this sensitization, lymphokines are released from T-cells, which induce an increase in microbicidal activity of the macrophages.</p>
                        <p>Immune properties of the solid caseum are converted suddenly to a highly fertile environment for intense bacterial propagation at the onset of liquefaction characterizing the sequence of pathologic events of progressive clinical pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
                        <p>Effectiveness of immune mechanisms that are responsible for bacillary destruction are influenced by: -</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Environmental factors</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Acquired Immunity and Hypersensitivity</h3>
                        <p>Hypersensitivity (allergy) and acquired immunity in tuberculosis vary and independent but appear concurrently.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Acquired Immunity</h4>
                        <p>Acquired immunity is mediated through cellular and biochemical mechanisms linked with delayed hypersensitivity. The mediation is via small antigen-responsive lymphocytes, which after initial infection with tubercle bacilli become immunologically committed cells.</p>
                        <p>Further interaction of sensitized lymphoid cells with bacilli results in formation of potent molecules that cause several important immunologically oriented behaviour of cells in the cellular defence system. The immuno-competent cells initiate an immune respsone, have a long circulating life span, are in constant motion through lymphoid tissue to the blood, and back again.</p>
                        <p>The effector molecules, which are the lymphokines (cytokines) include -</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Migration inhibition factor (inhibits migration of macrophages)</li>
                            <li>Macrophage activating factor (enhance metabolism and functional capacity)</li>
                            <li>Mitogenic and lymphocyte activating factor (induce blastogenesis and cell division of lymphocytes)</li>
                            <li>Lymphotoxin (a cytotoxic material)</li>
                            <li>Chemotaxin factors - attract neutrophils and monocytes</li>

                        <p>Intradermal injection of 0.1 mls of tuberculoprotein, purified protein derivative (PPD). A delayed hypersensitivity reaction (DHR) develops in individuals previously infected with tuberculous infection. The reaction is identified as an indurated area of >15 mm in 72 hours. Patients with disseminated tuberculosis may show negative test due to release of a large amount of tuberculoproteins from the endogenous lesion masking the hypersensitivity test.</p>
                        <p>A positive test indicates a cell mediated hypersensitivity to tubercular antigens but does not distinguish between infection and disease.

                        <p>This is achieved by injection of attenuated strains of bovine type of tubercle bacilli, Bacilli Calmette Guerin (BCG). Cell mediated immunity with consequent delayed hypersensitivity reaction develops with healing of the lesion. The cell-mediated immunity persists rendering the host tuberlin positive and hence immune.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Introduction</h3>
                        <p>TB infection begins when the mycobacteria reach the pulmonary alveoli, where they invade and replicate within the endosomes of alveolar macrophages. The primary site of infection in the lungs is called the Ghon focus usually located in either the upper part of the lower lobe, or the lower part of the upper lobe. The bacteria are picked up by dendritic cells, which do not allow replication but can transport the bacilli to local (mediastinal) lymph nodes.</p>
                        <p>Further spread is through the bloodstream to other tissues and organs where secondary TB lesions can develop in other parts of the lung (particularly the apex of the upper lobes), peripheral lymph nodes, kidneys, brain, and bone. All parts of the body can be affected by the disease, though it rarely affects the heart, skeletal muscles, pancreas and thyroid.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Classification</h3>
                        <p>Tuberculosis is classified as one of the granulomatous inflammatory conditions in which macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and fibroblasts aggregate to form a granuloma, with lymphocytes surrounding the infected macrophages. The granuloma prevents dissemination of the mycobacteria and provides a local environment for communication of cells of the immune system. Within the granuloma, T lymphocytes (CD4<sup>+</sup>) secrete cytokines such as interferon gamma, which activates macrophages to destroy the bacteria with which they are infected. T lymphocytes (CD8<sup>+</sup>) can also directly kill infected cells.</p>
                        <p>Importantly, bacteria are not always eliminated within the granuloma, but can become dormant, resulting in a latent infection. Another feature of the granulomas of human tuberculosis is the development of cell death, also called necrosis, in the center of tubercles.</p>
                        <p>If TB bacteria gain entry to the bloodstream from an area of damaged tissue they spread through the body and set up many foci of infection, all appearing as tiny white tubercles in the tissues. This severe form of TB disease is most common in infants and the elderly and is called miliary tuberculosis. Patients with this disseminated TB have a fatality rate of approximately 20%, even with intensive treatment.</p>
                        <p>In many patients the infection tissue destruction and necrosis are balanced by healing and fibrosis and the affected tissue is replaced by scarring and cavities filled with cheese-like white necrotic material. During active disease, some of these cavities are joined to the air passages bronchi and this material can be coughed up. It contains living bacteria and can therefore pass on infection. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place. Upon cure, affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Lesions in PTB</h3>
                        <p>The basic types of tissue change in tuberculosis include -</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Exudative lesion</li>
                            <li>Caseation and cavity formation</li>
                            <li>Tubercle or granuloma formation</li>
                            <li>Non-specific lesions</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Exudative Lesions</h4>
                        <p>The lung is the most often site of primary lesion in tuberculosis. The earliest reaction to the tubercle bacilli is a pre-exudative dilatation of alveolar capillaries with moderate swelling of alveolar endothelial cells. The swollen alveolar endothelial cells contain limited numbers of phagocytized tubercle bacilli.The exudative phase follows rapidly and forms three patterns: -</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Fibrinomacrophagicalveolitis
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Many tubercle bacilli are seen within the mononuclear macrophages in the alveolar lumen plus fibrin and some extracellular bacilli</li>
                                    <li>Polymorphonuclear cells are seen in the alveoli</li>
                                    <li>The lesion is very prone to caseation</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Polymorphonuclearalveolitis
                                <ul>
                                    <li>There is predominance of polymorphonuclear cells</li>
                                    <li>Fibrin and oedema are present</li>
                                    <li>A large number of tubercle bacilli are seen through the lesion</li>
                                    <li>The lesion rarely caseates but is prone to liquefaction</li>
                                    <li>Rarely seen in primary tuberculosis</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Fibrinousalveolitis
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This is not seen in primary infection</li>
                                    <li>Fibrin is present with few or no cellular elements and tubercle bacilli</li>
                                    <li>It is prone to caseation</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The polymorphonuclear response is more often provoked when the infection is massive or when host susceptibility is great. The extent and duration of primary exudative response depends on the number of bacilli present, native resistance of the host and onset of hypersensitivity.</p>
                        <p>During this phase, the alveolar structure is preserved as the bacilli are multiplying. The lesions undergo almost complete resolution and onset of caseous necrosis heralds a change in reaction of the tissues towards the bacilli causing disruption of the alveolar structure and hypersensitivity or allergy producing changes in behaviour and morphology of the infected tissues.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Caseation and Cavity Formation</h4>
                        <p>Caseation is a type of necrosis (flavoured cheese made of sheep or goat's milk) is characteristic of tuberculosis. The tubercle bacilli reduce in number following their destroyed in the caseum, which is the site of tremendous bacillary destruction. The number of bacilli and the extent of exudation influence the magnitude of necrosis.</p>
                        <p>Caseation is an expression of hypersensitivity and cellular immunity. The behaviour of the caseum is critical and determines progression of tuberculosis as disease. The caeous (cheesy) material may undergo two processes (1) it may remain solid and undergo localization, resorption, hyaline degeneration, fibrosis and if the necrotic material is large - calcification or ossification (this changes are associated with reduction in the number of tubercle bacilli and eventual sterilization) and (2) may soften and liquefy (less frequent occurrence)</p>
                        <p>Softening and liquefaction of the caseous material is associated with large areas of caseation, invasion by polymorphonulcear cells and appearance of proteolyic enzymes. Stimulated macrophages play a role in this process as they produce a plasminogen activator (plasmin system). Softening is accompanied by intense multiplication of tubercle bacilli.</p>
                        <p>The liquefied caseum empties into a bronchus with intralobular dissemination of bacilli into other parts of the lung. The lesion, which has sloughed off its contents into the bronchus, is now a cavity. Atmospheric oxygen now has access to the lumen of the cavity where bacillary proliferation continues in the necrotic inner zone. A capsule of granulation tissue and fibrous tissue that surrounds the necrotic inner circle contributes to the chronicity of the tuberculous cavity. Without treatment, few cavities heal and remain open sources of multiplying tubercle bacilli.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Tubercle or Granuloma Formation</h4>
                        <p>Tubercle or granuloma formation may proceed or follow necrosis. Polymorphonuclear and mononuclear macrophages (from blood monocytes and local tissues) appear and continue to phagocytose tubercle bacilli at the periphery of the lesion. This type of inflammatory response that involves chiefly mononuclear cells is described as granulomatous inflammation in contrast to polymorphonuclear response to pyogenic organisms.</p>
                        <p>The macrophages undergo structural changes because of immune mechanisms. They increase in size, cytoplasm becomes pale and oesinophilic and their nuclei become elongated and vesicular. This makes the macrophages resemble epithelial cells (are then called epitheloid cells).</p>
                        <p>Macrophages continue entering the tissues from circulating monocytes or local proliferation, undergo changes to form more epitheloid cells, and with time adjacent epitheloid cells aggregate into tight clusters or granulomas.Release of cytokines in response to sensitized CD4+ cells and constituents of the mycobacterium cell wall facilitate formation of granulomas.</p>
                        <p>Some macrophages divide atypically of may coalesce to form multinucleated giant cells of Langhan's type. Simultaneous with the cellular reactions, new capillaries, lymphocytes, fibrobroblasts and collagen tissue appear to encircle the entire area of epitheloid cells and caseation appears in the centre enhancing granuolma formation.This forms a hard tubercle. Within 10 - 14 days, the centre of the cellular mass begins to undergo caseation necrosis exhibited by cheesy appearance and high lipid content. This results in formation of the soft tubercle, which is the hallmark of tuberculous lesions.</p>
                        <p>Caseation necrosis results from interaction of mycobacterium with a activated T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup> helper cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> suppressor cells) and direct toxicity of mycobacterium on macrophages. The soft tubercle, which is a fully developed granuloma with caesous centre, does not favour rapid proliferation of tubercle bacilli.</p>

The organisms may be swallowed into the gastrointestinal tract resulting in intestinal tuberculosis or peritoneal abscess and fistula.</p>

                        <p>The lung is the main organ affected in tuberculosis. Based on tissue response and age the infection with tubercle bacilli is of two main types: - primary and secondary infection.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">10.1. Primary Infection</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Introduction</h4>
                        <p>Primary pulmonary infection occurs usually in children lacking previous exposure to tubercle bacilli or vaccinated against it. It begins as a single granulomatous lesion called Ghon focus, which is subjacent to the pleura in the inferior upper lobe or superior lower lobe regions.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Primary or Ghon's Complex</h4>
                        <p>Primary complex or Ghon's complex is the lesion produced at the portal of entry with foci in the draining lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes. Tissues involved are mainly the lungs and hilar lymph nodes. Other tissues that may be involved are the tonsils, cervical lymph nodes, small intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes. Dissemination from primary tuberculosis is high in immunosuppresed hosts as in HIV/AIDS patients.</p>
                        <p>The primary complex or Ghon's complex in the lungs consists of three components: -</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Pulmonary component (Ghon focus)</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pulmonary Component (Ghon's Focus)</h4>
                        <p>The Ghon's focus is the lesion in the lungs thatis a 1-2 cm diameter solitary area of tuberculous pneumonia located under the pleura in the lower part of the upper lobe. It forms at the subpleural region in the midzone of the lung.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Lymphatic Vessel Component</h4>
                        <p>The lymphatic vessels draining the lung lesion contain phagocytes containing the bacilli. They may develop beaded, military tubercles along the path of hilar lymph node.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Lymph node component</h4>
                        <p>The lymph node component consists of enlarged hilar and tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes in the area drained. The affected lymph nodes are matted and show caseation necrosis.</p>
                        <p>In case of involvement of the intestines, a small primary focus occurs in the intestine with enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes producing tabesmesenterica. Enlarged and caseous mesenteric lymph nodes may rupture into the peritoneal cavity and cause tuberculous peritonitis.</p>

                        <ol>

                            <li>Progressive primary tuberculosis - the primary focus grows and caseous material is disseminated through the bronchi to other parts of the same lung or the opposite lung</li>
                            <li>Miliary spread - bacilli enter the circulation via erosion in a blood vessel and spread to various fibres tissues and organs such as the liver, spleen, kidney, brain and bone marrow. This is called primary miliary tuberculosis.</li>
                            <li>Pleural effusion - inflammatory reaction in the adjacent lung induces development of an effusion in the pleural cavity</li>
                            <li>Tuberculous empyema - infection may involve the pleura directly from the Ghon's focus and lead to development of the tubercuolus empyema.</li>
                            <li>Reactivation of primary tuberculosis - lowered immunity and increased hypersensitivity of the host may result in activation of healed lesions resulting in progressive secondary tuberculosis. This situation is common in children.</li>
                            <li>Mechanical effects - large granulomas can obstruct the bronchi leading to hypoxia and lung collapse (atelectasis)</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Introduction</h4>
                        <p>Secondary pulmonary tuberculosis denotes active infection in a previously sensitized individual. It is also called secondary or post primary or re-infection or chronic tuberculosis and most cases represent reactivation of dormant bacilli from primary lesions. It occurs later in life as a reactivation or reinfection.</p>
                        <p>Secondary tuberculosis is generally found in the apices of the lungs because of preference of M. tuberculosis for high oxygen tensions. Other sites and tissues include tonsils, pharynx, larynx, small intestine and the skin.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Secondary tuberculosis lesions may progress to cavity fibrocaseous tuberculosis, tuberculous bronchopneumonia or miliary tuberculosis.</p>
                        <p>The infection may be acquired from endogenous or exogenous sources. The endogenous sources include reactivation of the dormant primary complex while the exogenous is fresh dose of re-infection by the tubercle bacilli.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Secondary Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h4>
                        <p>Lesions in secondary pulmonary tuberculosis usually begin as 1-2 cm apical area of consolidation of the lung and with time develop a small area of central caseation necrosis and peripheral fibrosis.</p>
                        <p>Secondary pulmonary tuberculosis occurs by haematogenous spread of infection from primary complex to apex of the affected lung where oxygen tension is high and favourable for growth of aerobic tubercle bacilli. HIV /AIDS patients previously exposed to tuberculous infection have a high incidence of reactivation of primary pulmonary tuberculosis with hilar lymph node involvement rather than cavitation and apical lesions in the lungs.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Course of Secondary Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Healing with fibrosis, scarring and calcification</li>
                            <li>Lesions coalesce to form larger area of tuberculous pneumonia producing progressive secondary pulmonary tuberculosis with pulmonary and extra-pulmonary involvement such as fibrocaseous tuberculosis, tuberculouscaseous pneumonia and miliary tuberculosis</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Fibrocaseous Tuberculosis</h4>
                        <p>The area of tuberculous pneumonia undergoes massive central necrosis, which may break into a bronchus forming a cavity (cavity or open tuberculosis) or remain as a soft caseous lesion (non-cavity or chronic fibrocaseous tuberculosis).</p>
                        <p>The cavity developed forms a favourable environment for proliferation of tubercle bacilli because of the high oxygen tension. The cavity may communicate with the bronchial tree and become the source of spread of the infection (open tuberculosis). Open cases of secondary tuberculosis may implant tuberculous lesions on mucosal linings of air passages resulting in endobronchial and endotracheal tuberculosis. Ingestion of sputum containing tubercle bacilli produces laryngeal and intestinal tuberculosis.</p>

                        <p>Tuberculous pneumonia is an overwhelming infection characterized by extensive tuberculous consolidation of one or more lobes of the lungs. The tuberculous lesion in an individual spreads to the rest of the lung and produces extensive caseous pneumonia. Persons with AIDS and immunocompromised persons are prone to the rapidly progressive infection.</p>

                        <ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Miliary Tuberculosis</h3>
                        <p>Miliary tuberculosis develops if a mass of tuberculous inflammatory tissue erodes into a large blood vessel disseminating large numbers of the organisms throughout the body via the blood stream. The term miliary expresses the resemblance of the multiple foci of disseminated tubercles in the liver, spleen, kidney and other tissues to millet seeds.</p>
                        <p>The spread is either by entry of infection into the pulmonary vein or pulmonary artery. Spread via the pulmonary vein produces dissemination or isolated organ lesions in different extra-pulmonary sites such as the liver, kidney, spleen, brain and bone marrow. Pulmonary artery dissemination restricts spread of miliary lesions within the lungs.</p>
