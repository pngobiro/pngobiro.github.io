                        <p>Aspiration pneumonia is a pulmonary sequelae resulting from the abnormal entry of endogenous secretions or exogenous substances into the lower airways. This occurs because of breakdown in defences that protect the tracheobronchial tree (e.g. glottic closure, cough reflex and cleansing mechanisms of the lower respiratory tract) and pulmonary complications that result from the aspiration event.</p>

                        <p>Aspiration pneumonia refers to three distinctive syndromes based on the character of the inoculation, which defines the pathogenesis of pulmonary complications, clinical presentation and treatment. The three syndromes namely chemical pneumonitis, bacterial infection and mechanical obstruction may overlap.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.1. CHEMICAL PNEUMONITIS</h4>
                        <h5>Introduction</h5>
                        <p>Chemical pneumonitis refers to fluids that are inherently toxic to the lower airways and can initiate an inflammatory reaction that is independent of bacterial infection. Examples of such fluids include - acids (e.g. gastric acid - most common), volatile hydrocarbons (gasoline, kerosene and animal fats/milk), mineral oil and alcohol.</p>
                        <h5>Pathogenesis and Pathology</h5>
                        <p>Acids induce an inflammatory reaction, which is more pronounced at a pH of less than 2.5. Pathologic changes occur with devastating rapidity. After 48 hours the lung is grossly oedematous and haemorrhagic and shows alveolar consolidation. Resolution begins on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day and may be complete or result in parenchymal scarring.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.2. BACTERIAL INFECTION</h4>
                        <h5>Introduction</h5>
                        <p>Bacterial infection is the most common form of aspiration pneumonia. Bacteria such as Streptococcuspneumoniae, Heamophilusinfluenzae, gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcusaureus are relatively virulent in lower airways and a small inoculation is all that is required for the infection to take root. These pathogens cause pneumonia by microaspiration (aspiration of small volumes). Diagnosis is suspected when a susceptible host develops fever, purulent sputum and a pulmonary infiltrate in a dependent pulmonary segment.</p>
                        <h5>Pathology</h5>
                        <p>The aspirated inoculum is generally composed of oropharyngeal secretions habouring bacteria from various sources in the upper airway. The infections are polymicrobial flora with the principal pathogens being anaerobic bacteria. Aerobic pathogens are present too while gram-negative bacilli are common in patients with hospital acquired aspiration pneumonia.</p>
                        <h5>Presentation</h5>
                        <p>It takes a variety of pathologic forms with the initial lesion is pneumonitis, an inflammatory reaction in the pulmonary parenchyma. After 7-14 days from the onset of the initial episode, there is suppuration, lung abscess, necrotizing pneumonia and empyema.</p>
                        <p>Anaerobic pneumonitis is one of the few bacterial pneumonias that cause chronic symptoms such as chronic fatigue, malaise, fever, weight loss and anaemia. In acute form there may be multiple pulmonary cavities resulting in pulmonary gangrene or necrotizing pneumonia or very large lung abscesses with life threatening complications.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.3. MECHANICAL OBSTRUCTION</h4>
                        <p>Mechanical obstruction is sequelae of aspirating fluids or particulate matter that are not inherently toxic to the lung but can cause airway obstruction or reflex airway closure.</p>
                        <h5>Fluids</h5>
                        <p>Fluids that are not inherently toxic to the lungs include saline, barium, water and gastric content with a pH exceeding 2.5.</p>
                        <h5>Solid Particles</h5>
                        <p>The effects and severity of mechanical obstruction depends on the size the particle and the level of obstruction. Large objects obstruct the trachea and larynx causing sudden respiratory distress, aphonia, cyanosis and death. It is very common in children during the oral stage. The particles involve the usual objects such as peanuts, vegetable particles, inorganic material, and teeth just to mention a few. The vegetable materials are bad because they swell due to their hydroscopic properties and the undigested cellulose cats as a local irritant causing inflammation.</p>
                        <p>Aspiration of a large material causing sudden respiratory distress is referred to as café coronary when one aspirates a big chunk of meat at a restaurant dinner because it resembles the effects of myocardial infarction. On-scene resuscitation is Heimlich manoeuvre. Aspiration of small particles causes less severe process because of partial or complete obstruction of the smaller airways.</p>
                        <p>The initial symptom is cough and involvement of major bronchi results in wheeze, dyspnoea, cyanosis, chest pain, vomiting, atelectasis and obstructive emphysema. Bacterial infection mainly by anaerobic bacteria from the oropharynx is a frequent complication of lower airway obstruction that persists for 1-2 weeks or more</p>

                        <p>These are hospital-acquired pulmonary infections, acquired in the course of stay in the hospital. Nosocomial pneumonia is a new episode of pneumonia occurring at least 2 days after admission to hospital. It encompasses post-operative and certain forms of aspiration pneumonia. They are common in patients with severe underlying disease, immunosuppression, prolonged antibiotic therapy or invasive devices and procedures e.g. intravenous catheters. They are life-threatening infections.</p>
