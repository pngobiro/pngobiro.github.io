                        <p>Respiration is the process by which $O_{2}$ is transported to and used by cells, and $CO_{2}$ produced is eliminatedfrom the body, a task effectively carried out by the cooperative work of the respiratory system, red blood cells and the circulatory system. Oxygenation of blood and elimination of $CO_{2}$ is calledexternal respiration while utilization of $O_{2}$ by cells and production of $CO_{2}$ by the cell is described as internal respiration or cellular respiration. Most cells in the human body require $O_{2}$ for survival and to carry out their functions. During their normal processes of work the cells use up $O_{2}$ and produce $CO_{2}$ as a waste product that must be eliminated from the body.</p>
                        <p>The normal intake of air is 7 litres/min of which 5 litres is available for alveolar ventilation. The definite flow is maintained from the point of entry up to the terminal bronchiole after which the flow ceases and allows gas exchange to take place. The factors that maintain adequate respiration include adequate intake of air, rapid diffusion along the alveolar ducts and through alveolar walls and adequate perfusion. In chronic lung disease, ventilation, diffusion and perfusion disorders are present in varying degrees. Under normal circumstances the upper area of the lung is better ventilated than perfused while the base is better perfused than ventilated an imbalance magnified in lung disease.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.0 REVIEW OF ANATOMY OF RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</h3>
                        <p>The respiratory system comprises of lungs and respiratory passages (airways), which work in intimate collaboration with the thoracic cage, respiratory muscles and the pulmonary circulation.</p>
                        <p>Respiratory physiology is a complex series of interacting and coordinated processes that ensure adequate and prompt supply of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide in an effort to maintain the stability and consistency of the internal environment. It takes on board physiological control mechanisms such as acid-base, water and electrolyte balance, circulation and metabolism.</p>
                        <p>The lungs are the structures where gas exchange between blood and inspired air takes place whereas the respiratory passages are the structures along which air is conveyed to and from the lungs. The passages include the nasal cavities, nasal pharynx, mouth, oral pharynx, larynx, the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts. It is important to note that usually the bronchi and bronchioles are imbedded in the structure of the lung substance.</p>

                        <p>The respiratory system comprises of lungs and respiratory passages (airways), which work in intimate collaboration with the thoracic cage, respiratory muscles and the pulmonary circulation. It uses highly effective convective systems of ventilation and circulation for long distance transport of $O_{2}$ and $CO_{2}$ and uses diffusion exclusively for short distance movements of $O_{2}$ and $CO_{2}$.</p>
                        <p>The main components of the respiratory system are: - the air pump, mechanism for oxygen and carbon dioxide carrying, gas exchange surface, circulatory system and regulatory mechanisms.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Provide oxygen to the blood stream and remove carbon dioxide</li>
                            <li>Enables sound production or vocalization as expired air passes over the vocal cords</li>
                            <li>Assists in abdominal compression during micturation (urination), defecation and parturition (childbirth)</li>
                            <li>Lung Defence mechanism - protective and reflexive non-breathing air movements e.g. coughing and sneezing to keep the air passageways clean.</li>
                            <li>Temperature regulation - loss of heat during expiration</li>
                            <li>Maintenance of water balance - small amounts of water are lost during expiration</li>
                            <li>Regulation of acid-base balance</li>
                            <li>Anticoagulant function - lungs contain mast cells which secret heparin which prevents intravascular clotting</li>
                            <li>Metabolic functions - manufacture surfactant for local use, fibrinolytic system</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">6.0 INTRODUCTION TO PATHOLOGY OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</h3>
                        <p>The prime role of the respiratory system is oxygenation of blood and removal of carbon dioxide $CO_{2}$. This function requires that air is brought into close approximation with blood which is provided by the anatomical arrangement of the alveoli and blood vessels.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Constant inward and outward flow of the enormous air exposes the respiratory system to infection by both microbes present in inspired air and by downward spread of bacteria that colonize the nose and throat</li>
                            <li>Inhalation of pollutants such as dust, fumes, smokes increase the incidence of bronchitis, chronic lung disease and bronchial carcinoma</li>
                            <li>Vascular architecture of the lungsallows passage of blood into the lungs during each cycle makes the lungs to be vulnerable to effects of cardiovascular diseases. This is due to disturbance of pulmonary haemodynamics e.g. pulmonary oedema and on the other hand, lung diseases interfere with the pulmonary blood flow with noticeable effects on the heart and systemic circulation because cardiac and pulmonary functions are closely interdependent.</li>
                            <li>The lung is a frequent victim of malfunction elsewhere for example failure of the left side of the heart results in pulmonary congestion and oedema, systemic thrombosis on many occasions causes pulmonary embolism and the lungs are a common site for secondary tumours.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The main diseases of the airways and the lungs are caused by infection and inflammation with environmental factors such as smoking and occupational exposure to dust contributing to the morbidity and mortality resulting from respiratory problems. Tumours of the bronchial tree and lung are common and important, as almost all of them are malignant. The key effect of respiratory problems is poor oxygenation resulting in respiratory failure.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Risk Factors</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Prematurity</li>
                            <li>Diabetic mother</li>

                            <li>Multiple births</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pathogenesis</h4>
                        <p>Immature or damaged lung is unable to make enough surfactant (a lecithin-rich surfaceactive lipid) that reduces surface tension in the alveoli and keeps the alveoli open. Lack of surfactant results in lung collapse with microatelectasis.</p>
                        <p>Hypoxia causes damage to the alveolar lining cells and pulmonary arterial constrictionresulting in endothelial damage hence plasma leaks into the alveoli where it is deposited as fibrin (bright pink-stained membrane) and thus the name hyaline membrane disease. Fibrin reduces gas exchange further worsening the hypoxic state.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pathology</h4>
                        <p>The lungs: -</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Have fibrous obliteration of bronchioles</li>
                            <li>Peribronchial fibrosis</li>
                            <li>Overdistended alveolar</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Features</h4>
                        <p>If a baby is born before his lungs have matured, he will develop respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). A baby with RDS tries to cry and breathe at birth, but within minutes to hours he starts working hard to breathe because his lungs tend to collapse with each breath. A baby with RDS:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Breathes faster than 60 breaths a minute</li>
                            <li>Makes a grunting sound when he breathes out</li>
                            <li>Has respiratory distress (what are the features)</li>
                            <li>Has Cyanosis</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Diagnosis</h4>
                        <p>Certain laboratory tests are done to help determine the cause of the breathing problems. These tests include:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Blood culture</strong><br>All babies are treated for the possibility of infection with antibiotics. Before starting the antibiotics, a sample of the baby's blood is tested for infection. The test is called a blood culture. If the baby does not have an infection, the test will be negative and the antibiotics will be stopped in 3 days.</li>
                            <li><strong>Blood gas test:</strong> Blood gas tests show how much oxygen is in the bloodstream. This information helps your doctor know how much oxygen the baby needs. It also tells how hard the baby is working to breathe and whether he needs help to keep breathing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chest X-ray:</strong> X-rays for babies use very little radiation and do not cause the baby any problems later in life.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Differential Diagnosis</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Pneumonia</li>
                            <li>Extra fluid in the lungs</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Complications</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Intracerebral bleed (hypoxia related)</li>
                            <li>PDA (failure to close as normal closure is stimulated by oxygenation)</li>
                            <li>Necrotizing enterocolitis ( ischaemic/hypoxic damage of the gut)</li>
                            <li>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (high pressure ventilation andoxygen toxicity to alveolar lining cells)</li>
