                        <p>Bronchial asthma is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disorder characterized by increased responsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree to various stimuli resulting in widespread paroxysmal contraction of bronchial airways due to muscular spasms and plugging by increased thick mucous secretions from the mucosal glands.</p>
                        <p>The changes that occur result in a state whereby the respiratory tree is drawn longer with a reduced diameter forming a physiological valve mechanism that leads to easy or normal inspiration and difficult and prolonged expiration. The short inspiration and long expiration produces the characteristic wheeze/rhonchi in bronchial asthma.</p>
                        <p>The wide spread narrowing of the respiratory tree may be relieved spontaneously or by therapy but if relieve is not attained a severe and unremitting state of the disease called status asthmaticus which is usually fatal ensues.</p>
                        <p>Asthmatic attacks cause shortness of breath and wheezing respirations as a result of restricted movement of air through tightly constricted air passages. The bronchial spasms exert great effect on expiration than inspiration because the calibre of bronchioles varies with the phase of respiration.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.1. Extrinsic (Atopic, Allergic) Asthma</h4>
                        <p>This is the commonest type of asthma that has a definite cause associated with the disease as it runs in families and individuals with history of allergy. The individuals may have a history of diseases such as rhinitis, urticaria and infantile eczema. Atopic or extrinsic asthma begins in childhood and early adult life.</p>
                        <p>Subjects with extrinsic asthma have increased levels of IgE representing type I hypersensitivity reaction mechanisms and they do show characteristic wealing skin reactions to common allergens in the environment.</p>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Pathogenesis</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Exposure of pre-sensitizedIgE coated mast cells to allergens (antigens) results in release of chemical mediators in a reaction that first takes place on the mucosal surface and results in the opening of the intercellular tight junctions thereby enhancing penetration of the mast cells by antigens to reach the numerous submuocal mast cells. This reaction occurs within minutes (acute or immediate response)</li>
                            <li>Direct stimulation of the subepithelial vagal (parasympathetic) receptors provokes bronchoconstriction through both central and local reflexes.</li>
                            <li>This is an acute or immediate response, which consists ofbronchoconstriction, oedema, mucous secretion and hypotension(in severe cases).</li>
                            <li>Mast cells release cyokines, which result in influx of leucocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils and oesinophils) which mediate the late phase reaction together with recruited chemotaxic factors.</li>
                            <li>Other sources of mediators of the late phase reaction include the vascular endothelium and airway epithelial cells(produce cytokines in response to infection, drugs and gases.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.2. Intrinsic Asthma (Non-atopic)</h4>
                        <p>Intrinsic asthma develops in adult life staring during the middle age and is commonly associated with chronic bronchitis. There is a negative family history of the disease as well as personal history of allergy as these individuals fail to reveal a responsive allergen. However, there may be a history of respiratory symptoms compatible with childhood asthma. Individuals with intrinsic asthma tend to develop drug hypersensitivity especially with aspirin and penicillin.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.3. Drug Induced</h4>
                        <p>Drugs such as aspirin trigger asthma by inhibiting COX pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism without affecting the lipoxygenase route thus resulting in increased production of bronchoconstritiveleukotrienes.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.4. Occupational Asthma</h4>
                        <p>Occupational asthma is stimulated by fumes (epoxy resin, plastics), organic and chemical dusts (wood, cotton, platinum), gases (toluene), chemicals (formaldehyde and penicillin products).</p>

                        <p>The pathogenesis of bronchial asthma pivots around: -Airway hypersensitivity, Inflammation and Airway obstruction</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4.1. Airway Hypersensitivity</h3>
                        <p>There is increased responsiveness of the respiratory airways of the lung to allergens in the environment whose inhalation triggers an immediate acute response initiated by IgE sensitised mast cells in the mucosal surface of the respiratory tree. The mast cells degranulate releasing mediators of inflammation such as histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins and platelet aggregating factor (PAF) and chemostatic factors for oesinophils and neutrophils.</p>
                        <p>The respiratory tree is hypersensitive to normal allergens, which can trigger off reactions. These allergens include inhaled and non-inhaled ones. The inhaled allergens include - aeroallergens (house dust mites, pollens, animal dander and fungal spores) air pollution, extreme cold. The non-inhaled are exercise and ingested substances.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4.2. Inflammation</h3>
                        <p>Following the hypersensitivity reaction and release of mediators of inflammation, there ensues an inflammatory reaction that results in oedema formation, bronchoconstriction and hypersecretion of mucous and accumulation of oesinophils and neutrophils. There is infiltration of the airways with inflammatory cells, T<sub>helper</sub> lymphocytes, oesinophils and mast cells, which is a common feature in asthma.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4.3. Airway Obstruction</h3>
                        <p>The pathologic basis of airway obstruction is: -</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Constriction of the airway's smooth muscles due to release of bioactive mediators and neurotransmitters.</li>
                            <li>Thickening of the airway epithelium due to oedema formation</li>
                            <li>Presence of liquids and mucous secretions within the confines of the bronchial lumen</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4.4. Mast Cells</h3>
                        <p>The number of mast cells is increased in the respiratory epithelium and surface secretions. Mast cells generate and release powerful smooth muscle and vasoactive mediators such as histamine, prostaglandin $D_2$ ($PD_2$) and leukotrienesC4 ($LTC_4$) that cause the immediate asthmatic reaction. Note that $\beta_2$ adrenoreceptor e.g. salbutamol inhibit release of mediators by the mast cells.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4.5. The Epithelium</h3>
                        <p>Following the inflammatory reaction, epithelial cells shed during exacerbations of asthma results in desquamations, which increase permeability of the airway to inhaled allergens and exposure of nerve fibre endings. These desquamated materials from the columnar epithelium can be identified in the sputum as twisted strips called Curschmann's spirals.</p>
                        <p>The inflamed epithelium produces mediators such as cytokines, granulocytes macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that prolong the life of tissue oesinophils, TNF and interlukins that capture the inflammatory cells within the epithelium.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4.6. Nerves</h3>
                        <p>Exposure of the nerve endings especially C-fibre afferent nerves leads to release of neurotransmitters such as substance P, neurokinin (NK) A and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) which are tachykinins that increase the inflammatory response. This usually contributes to bronchoconstriction, microvasculature leakage and mucous secretion. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and nitric oxide are potent neurotransmitters that are rapidly degraded in inflammation resulting in bronchoconstriction.</p>
                        <p>The and adrenergic systems of the autonomic nervous system are activated resulting in increased release of mediators from the mast cells but the cholinergic system which is extensive in the smooth muscles of the respiratory passages remains normal is asthma.</p>

                        <p>Macrophages and lymphocytes are abundant in the mucous membranes of the airways and alveoli. The macrophages usually take up and present allergens to the lymphocytes and release prostaglandins, PAF and leukotrienes. T<sub>H</sub> lymphocyte cells are activated to release cytokines, which aid in migration and activation of mast cells. Production of IL4 switches antibody production by B-lymphocytes to IgE. Macrophages and lymphocytes are influenced by corticosteroids and not by β-adrenergic agonists.</p>

                        <p>Oesinophils are abundant in bronchial secretions and when activated they release mediators such as PAF and LTC4, major basic protein (MBP) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) which are toxic to epithelial cells. The number and activity of eosinophils is rapidly decreased by corticosteroids. Oedema, vascular congestion and infiltration by oesinophils produce the Charcot Leyden crystals.</p>
