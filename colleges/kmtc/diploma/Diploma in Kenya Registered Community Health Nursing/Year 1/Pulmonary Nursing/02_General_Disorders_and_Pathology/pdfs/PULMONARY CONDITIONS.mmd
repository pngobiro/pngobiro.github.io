\section*{RESTRICTIVE DISORDERS}

\section*{PNEUMONIA}
- An acute infection of the lung parenchyma following entry of microbes into the lungs
- Microbes entering the lungs may come from cough droplets of an infected person, contaminated respiratory equipment, aspiration of microbes from the mouth, or the pharynx due to poor oral hygiene, or infection

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- when microbes enter the lungs, they multiply and release toxins, which induce inflammation in the lung tissue
- inflammation damage the mucous and alveolar membranes, hence diffuse edema and exudate
- the exudate fills the alveoli reducing the surface area for gaseous exchange

\section*{Types of pneumonia}

\section*{a)- lobar pneumonia}
- infection is confined to one lobe

\section*{b)- bronchopneumonia}
- generalized pneumonia which is a severe form
- characterized by suppurative inflammation localized in patches around the bronchi
- may result in formation of a lung abscess and empyema

-Elevate head of bed to promote chest expansion, mobilization and expectoration of secretions
-Teach on proper deep-breathing exercises to facilitate maximum expansion of lungs and improve productivity of cough
-Maintain adequate hydration of 31/day-warm fluids and in mobilization and expectoration of secretions (Contraindicated in heart failure)
-Nebulization to humidify the airway and thin secretions for easier expectoration
-Encourage ambulation to help mobilize secretions and reduce atelectasis
-Mucolytics to liquefy secretions
Impaired gas exchange related to decreased ventilation or perfusion or inflammatory effects or collection of mucus in airways as evidenced by dyspnea, cyanosis hypoxemia, and tachycardia.

\section*{Patient Outcome}
-Patient will experience improved gas exchange as evidenced by improving arterial blood gases.

\section*{Interventions}
-Maintain bed rest by planning activity and rest periods to preserve energy and reduce dyspneoa
-Administer oxygen therapy by mask or prongs to increase oxygen saturation
-Position with good lung down to increase perfusion of healthier lung and gas exchange.
-Teach Diaphragmatic and pursed-lip breathing to promote relaxation and increase CO2 excretions

\section*{Ineffective breathing pattern related to anxiety or pain as evidenced by ineffective cough}

\section*{Patient Outcome}
-Patient maintain an effective breathing pattern as evidenced by respiratory rate between 12-20 per minute.

\section*{Interventions}
-Determine and treat the cause
-Place patient in fowlers position to allow for maximum chest expansion
-Each patient on diaphragmatic breathing to promote relaxation and increase CO2

Excretions
-Encourage small frequent meals to prevent crowding of the diaphragm which increases

Dyspnea
-Help patient with activities of daily living to conserve energy and avoid over exertion and

Fatigue.

Acute pain related to inflammation of lung parenchyma/persistent coughing as evidenced by patient's expression of irritability, guarding of affected area or reports of discomfort

\section*{Patient's desired outcome:}
- the patient will verbalize control of pain, or will sleep and engage in activity appropriately

\section*{Nursing interventions:}
- Provide comfort measures like use of relaxation and breathing exercises to promote independence and enhance sense of well-being
- Frequent oral breathing and oxygen therapy can irritate and dry out mucous membranes, increasing discomfort
- Instruct on chest splinting techniques during coughing episodes to control chest discomfort and enhance effective coughing
- Analgesics to relieve pleuritic pain

Activity intolerance related to imbalance between oxygen supply and demand or general weakness as evidenced by verbal reports of fatigue or exertional dyspnea

Patient's desired outcome:

\section*{Risk for deficient fluid volume related to excessive fluid loss through /fever/diaphoresis/hyperventilation}

Desired outcome:
- Patient demonstrates fluid balance evidenced by moist mucous membranes

Nursing interventions:
- Assess and ascertain changes in vital signs since elevated temp. and prolonged fever increases metabolic rate and fluid loss through evaporation
- Monitor intake and output noting color and character of urine to obtain information about adequacy of fluid volume and replacement needs
- Force fluids to at least 3L/day to meet basic fluid needs and reduce risk of dehydration

\section*{CHEST INJURY}

\section*{Pneumothorax}
- Condition in which air has entered the pleural space of the lungs

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- Occur when air leaks into the pleural space
- Normally, the pressure in the pleural space is negative inorder to maintain lung inflation
- When either pleura is breached, air enters the pleural space, causing the lung to collapse

\section*{Types}

\section*{Simple pneumothorax}
- Also called spontaneous, occurs when air enters the pleural space when an air-filled bleb, or blister on the surface of the lung ruptures, allowing air from the airways to enter the pleural cavity
- Associated with diffuse interstitial lung disease or emphysema

\section*{Traumatic pneumothorax}
- Occur when air escapes from laceration in the tissue
- Maybe caused by a blunt trauma, penetrating chest trauma , tears, on the diaphragm, invasive thoracic procedures or trauma from mechanical ventilation
- Can be open: when the wound is large enough to allow air to pass in and out of the thoracic cavity during respiration
- Associated with circulatory problems hence is an emergency

\section*{Tension pneumothorax}
- Occurs when air is drawn into the cavity with each inspiration but cannot be expelled during expiration
- This causes increase in tension (positive pressure) in the cavity
- The lung collapses and the heart and other structures shift towards the unaffected side, compromising circulation and respiration

\section*{Signs and symptoms}
- Sudden sharp pleuritic pain
- Sharp pain on inhalation
- Cyanosis
- Tachycardia
- Rapid breathing
- Confusion and dizziness
- Increasing dyspnea
- Diminished breath sounds
- Hypotension
- Profuse diaphoresis

Hemothorax -is the term used to refer to presence Of blood in the pleural space
- It can occur with or without pneumothorax
- Causes are trauma lung cancer, pulmonary embolism and use of anticoagulants

\section*{Diagnostic tests}
- History/physical exam
- Chest xray
- Arterial blood gases
- Oxygen saturation

\section*{Medical management}
- According to cause and severity
- Chest tube insertion in the $4^{\text {th }}$ or $5^{\text {th }}$ intercostal space at the mid axillary line to drain fluid and air (the underwater seal drainage)
- Surgical repair in severe injuries
- Sterile talc or antibiotics like Tetracycline injected into the pleural space via thoracentesis to make pleural membranes stick together (pleurodesis) to prevent reoccurrence

- Air pollution
- Exposure to radiation
- Genetic predisposition
- Dietary deficiency of vit. A, C, E

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- The cancer originate from the respiratory tract epithelium, in the lining of the bronchi
- Presence of a predisposing factor in the lung tissue causes the lung cells to mutate creating changes in the cells and development of tumours

\section*{Types}
1. Small cell lung cancer (oat cell carcinoma)- caused by smoking, grow and metastasize rapidly,found centrally near the bronchi
2. Large cell carcinoma- occur anywhere in the lung s , grow rapidly, with early metastasis
3. Adenocarcinoma- common in womwe, affects peripheral lung fields

\section*{CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASES/CHROIC AIRFLOW LIMITATIONS}

This is a group of pulmonary disorders characterized by difficulty exhaling because of narrowed or blocked airways. Associated with conditions that limit airflow including Emphysema, Chronic Bronchitis and Asthma. A patient WITH COPD often has some degree of both Emphysema and Chronic Bronchitis. Asthma may also be present but the airway constriction is reversible. COPD may also be referred to as Chronic Airway Limitation ( CAL ) or Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( COLD ). COPD develops over at least 30 years before symptoms are evident and may be advanced by the time the patient seek treatment.

\section*{AETIOLOGY OF COPD}

Smoking or passive smoking.
Exposure to air pollution
Exposure to industrial chemicals
Some familial predisposition related to inherited deficiency of the enzyme alpha-antitrypsin (a, AT)

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS}

This is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with symptoms occurring three months out of the year for two consecutive years.
- Inflamed bronchial tree due to irritants
. Hypertrophied mucus-producing glands in the airway
. Excessively thick tenacious mucous
. Chronic low grade infection

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF EMPHYSEMA}
. Emphysema affects the alveolar membranes, causing destruction of the alveolar walls and loss of elastic recoil. Also causes damage to adjacent pulmonary capillaries

The passive expiration is impaired due to loss of alveolar recoil leading to air being trapped in the alveoli.
Reduction in pulmonary capillaries reduces gaseous exchange.
Emphysema can occur primarily in the respiratory bronchioles resulting to Centri-lobular Emphysema, with delayed alveolar damage. Pan-lobular Emphysema occurs. in respiratory bronchioles and alveoli

\section*{SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF COPD}

Exhibits dyspnea due to obstructed airway passages
CHRONIC productive cough, shortness of breath and activity intolerance in Chronic Bronchitis
Progressive shortness of breath accompanied by activity intolerance in Emphysema
Barrel-shaped chest due to hyper-inflated lungs caused by respiratory air trapping.
Crackles and wheezing that improves on coughing often noted on auscultation.

Elevated Pascal pressure of carbon dioxide and decreased Pascal pressure of oxygen in blood
Use of accessory muscles of respiration e.g. abdominal muscles
Polycythaemia in response to reduced oxygenation ( ruddy skin colour). Cynosis may also be present.
Right-sided heart failure may develop because the heart has to work harder to pump to the diseased lungs.
Loss of weight and malnourished in later stages of COPD

\section*{DIAGNOSTIC TESTS}
. Imaging to include chest x-ray and CT scan.
.complete blood cell count.
.arterial blood gas analysis later in disease process
.pulmonary function studies
.sputum laboratory analysis
.alpha-antitrypsin level analysis if deficiency is suspected.

\section*{MEDICAL TREATMENT OF COPD}

Caession of smoking.
Minimize exposure to respiratory contamination.
Administration of oxygen at a flow of 1 to 2 litres per to prevent suppression of the hypoxic drive.
A pulmonary rehabilitative programme initiated and continued at home help the patient to increase exercise tolerance and maintain a sense of well being.

Medication include the following: adrenergic, anticholinergic or theophylline bronchiodilators, expectorant, and intermittently antibiotics.

Nebulizer mist treatments and metered dose inhalers used to administer bronchodilators
.metered dose inhaler (MDI).
.nebulizer mist treatment (NMT)
.by mouth ( BO ).
Steroids used late in the disease to reduce airway inflammation.
Good hydration and A cool mist humidifier to help keep secretions loose.

Chest physiotherapy to include percussion and chest vibration to revoke excessive secretions

Advised to report onset of purulent sputum so that treatment is immediately started.

Avoidance of crowds and exposure to people with respiratory infection is advised.

Reduce risk of respiratory infection by a pneumococcal vaccination and yearly influenza vaccination.

Surgical removal of some of the diseased lung tissue ( Lung Volume Reduction Surgery ).

Replacement of alpha-antitrypsin to correct its deficiency in the body.

\section*{BRONCHIAL ASTMA}

A chronic obstructive respiratory condition characterized by inflammation of the mucosal lining of the bronchial tree and spasm of the bronchial smooth muscles.

\section*{CAUSE OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA}

Inherited
Allergic or idiosyncratic ( unexpected ).
Environmental pollutants/irritants

Emotional stress
Complicated Chronic Bronchitis.
Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ASTHMA}

Characterized by inflammation of the mucosal lining of the bronchial tree and bronchospasms. This causes narrowed airways and air trapping.
Symptoms are intermittent and reversible, with periods of normal airway function.

About 50\% develop in childhood and symptoms persist in diminished state,often returning in later life.

Allergic ASTHMA is triggered by allergens and is seasonal. Individuals who developed ASTHMA as children tend to have allergic ASTHMA

SIGN AND SYMPTOMS OF ASTHMA
Intermittent attacks which may last from minutes to days
Chest tightness
Dyspnea

Difficult moving air in and out of the lungs
Hypersensitive airways that are prone to ASTHMA symptoms for many weeks once initial symptoms are controlled
Increased respiratory rate to compensate for narrowed airway
Wheezing because of turbulent airflow through swollen airways with thick secretions.

A cough is common and may produce thick clear sputum
Use of accessory muscles to breath in severe attack

\section*{STATUS ASTHMATICUS}

A severe form of ASTHMA in which the airway obstruction is unresponsive to usual drug therapy.

\section*{CONTRIBUTING FACTORS}

Infections
Inhalation of air pollutants and allergens to which sensitized
Noncompliance in taking medications, including overuse of bronchiodilators.

Ingestion of aspirin or related drugs in aspirin sensitive patient Aspiration of gastric acid.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

Suprasternal retractions, use of accessory muscles of respiration.

Diminished breath sounds, decreased ability to speak in phrases or sentences.

Anxiety, irritability, fatigue, headache, impaired mental functioning.

Muscle twitching, condolence, diaphoresis due to continued carbon dioxide retention.

Tachycardia, elevated blood pressure.
Heart failure and death from suffocation.

\section*{MANAGEMENT AND NURSING INTERVENTION}

Monitor respiratory rate and oxygen saturation continuously. Also accompanied with frequent monitor of arterial blood gas levels, Bp, ECG.
Administer repeated aerosol treatments with beta2-agonist bronchodilators, such as albuterol or levalbuterol,

Add anticholinergic ipratropium as prescribed. Administer with caution until the metabolic and respiratory acidosis and hypoxaemia have been corrected.
Monitor intravenous therapy. Corticosteroids are given to treat inflammation of the airways; because they act slowly, their beneficial effects May not be a parent for several hours.

Fluids are given to treat dehydration and loosen secretions
Provide continuous humidified oxygen via cannula as prescribed.
Patients with associated COPD or Emphysema are at risk for depressed hypoxaemic ventilatory drive, thus compounding respiratory insufficiency, so use oxygen cautiously.
Initiate mechanical ventilation, if necessary.
Assist with mobilization of obstructing bronchial mucus. Perform chest physiotherapy (chest percussion and vibration). Administer
cough expectorant and mucolytic drugs as prescribed. Remove secretions by suctioning, or prepare for bronchoscopy if needed.

Provide adequate hydration.
Obtain portable chest x-ray and administer antibiotic, as prescribed, to treat any underlying respiratory infection

Alleviate the patient's anxiety and fear by acting calmly and reassuring the patient during attack
Stay with the patient until the attack subsidies

\section*{BRONCHIECTASIS}

This is damaged airway passages that allow bacteria and mucus to build up and pool in young lungs resulting in frequent infections and blockages of the airways.
A condition in which the lungs airways become damaged, making it hard PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Bronchial tubes of young lungs are permanently damaged, widened and thickened allowing bacteria and mucus to build up and pool in young lungs. This results in frequent infections and blockages of the airways

\section*{TYPES OF BRONCHIECTASIS}

Cystic fibrosis BRONCHIECTASIS. Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic condition that causes severe damaged to the respiratory system. Cystic fibrosis damage often results from a build up of thick, sticky mucus in the airways. Affects the cells that produces mucus

Non-cystic fibrosis BRONCHIECTASIS is associated with the following conditions:
.an abnormally functioning immune system
.autoimmune diseases.
.COPD
.alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
.HIV
.allergic aspergillosis.
.lung infections-whooping cough and tuberculosis.
.inflammatory bowel disease

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

.abnormal chestsounds or wheezing in chest with breathing.
.shortness of breath.
.chest pain
.weight loss.
.fatigue
.clubbing of fingernails and toenails.
.frequent respiratory infections.

\section*{DIAGNOSISOF BRONCHIECTASIS}

History and physical examination findings, after CT scan findings try to establish the cause of BRONCHIECTASIS

Chest CT scan since a chest x-ray doesn't provide enough details. Laboratory, microscopic and pulmonary function testing to evaluate the underlying cause........cbc count, immunoglobulin levels and sputum cultures
.sweat chloride test (genetic test if cystic fibrosis is suspected

\section*{TREATMENT OF BRONCHIECTASIS}

To slow down the progression of bronchiectasis
To keep infections and bronchial secretions under control.
To prevent further obstructions of the airways and minimize lung damage.
Common methods of treating include
.clearing the airways with breathing and chest exercises
.pulmonary rehabilitation

Vaccination against the flu, whooping cough, and measles.

\section*{BRONCHIOLITIS}

An inflammatory bronchial reaction in young children and infants commonly caused by a virus during winter months, characterized by common cold that progresses to coughing, wheezing and sometimes difficult breathing that lasts a week to a month.

This is a common lung infection caused by respiratory syncytal virus in young children and infants characterized by runny nose, stuffy nose, cough and slight fever (not always present).

\section*{RISK FACTORS}
.Children under two years old, greatly affects infants under three months old.
In infants RISK factors include
.premature birth
.heart and lung condition
.depressed immune system
.exposure to tobacco smoke
.un breastfed infant
.contact with multiple children
.crowded environment
.having school going or getting child care services siblings

\section*{CAUSES}

Mostly caused by respiratory syncytal virus.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}

The virus infects the bronchioles, making them to swell and inflamed. The mucus secreted as a result of swelling and inflammation. The mucus collects in these bronchioles and other airway passages, making it difficult for air to flow freely in and out of the lungs.

\section*{CINICAL FEATURES}

Runny and stuffy nose
Cough accompanied occasionally with slight fever
A week or more of difficulty breathing or wheezing. Audible wheezing sounds.
Laboured breathing where the ribs seem to suck inward when the infant inhaled.
Sluggish or lethargic appearance
Refusal to drink enough or breaching to fast to eat or drink.
Cynosis whereby the skin turn blue, especially the lip and fingernails

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}

Synopsis
Apnea which is a pause in breath associated with premature infants and infants within first two months of life

Dehydration
Low oxygen blood levels
Respiratory failure

\section*{PREVENTION}

Breastfeeding infants exclusively improves body immunity
Frequent hand washing, especially before touching the infant when you a cold or other respiratory infection

Recommended wearing a face mask while attending to vulnerable infants
Infected infants and children should be kept away until they recover from infection to avoid spreading to others.

Limit contact with people who have a fever or common cold.
Clean and disinfect surfaces regularly

Separate utensils for the infected person from those of the vulnerable group utensils.

Cover coughs and sneezes from spreading through droplets.
