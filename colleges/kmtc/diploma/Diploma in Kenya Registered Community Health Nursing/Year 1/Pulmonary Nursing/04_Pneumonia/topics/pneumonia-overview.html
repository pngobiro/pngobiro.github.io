                            <li>Pneumonia is an infection in one or both lungs caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi.</li>
                            <li>The infection leads to inflammation in the air sacs of the lungs, which are called alveoli. The alveoli filled with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe.</li>
                            <li>Both viral or bacterial pneumonia are contagious; This means they can spread from person to person through inhalation of airborne or droplets from a sneeze or cough.</li>
                            <li>Pneumonia can affect one or both lungs. Pneumonia in both of your lungs is called bilateral or double pneumonia</li>
                            <li>While all pneumonia is inflammation caused by an infection in the lungs, one may have different symptoms depending on whether the root cause is a virus, bacteria or fungi.</li>
                            <li>Bacterial pneumonia tends to be more common and more severe than viral pneumonia. It's more likely to require a hospital stay. Bacterial pneumonia is usually treated with antibiotics. Viral pneumonia causes flu-like symptoms and is more likely to resolve on its own. You usually don't need specific treatment for viral pneumonia.</li>

                                <strong>Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).</strong> This refers to pneumonia that is acquired outside of a medical/healthcare institution. Causes include;
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Bacteria:</strong> Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, also called pneumococcal disease, is the most common cause of CAP. Pneumococcal disease can also cause ear infections, sinus infections and meningitis. Mycoplasma pneumoniae bacteria causes atypical pneumonia, which usually has milder symptoms. Other bacteria that cause CAP include Haemophilus influenza, Chlamydia</li>
                                    <li><strong>Viruses:</strong> Viruses that cause the common cold, the flu (influenza), COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can sometimes lead to pneumonia.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Fungi (molds):</strong> Fungi, like Cryptococcus, Pneumocystis jirovecii and Coccidioides, are uncommon causes of pneumonia. People with compromised immune systems are most at risk of getting pneumonia from a fungus.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Protozoa:</strong> Rarely, protozoa like Toxoplasma cause pneumonia.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).</strong> This type of bacterial pneumonia is acquired during a hospital stay. It can be more serious than other types, as the bacteria involved may be more resistant to antibiotics. It is often caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, like methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).</strong> When people who are using ventilator get pneumonia, it is called VAP.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The same types of bacteria as community-acquired pneumonia, as well as the drug-resistant kinds that cause hospital-acquired pneumonia, cause VAP.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Aspiration pneumonia.</strong> Inhaling bacteria into your lungs from food, drink or saliva can cause aspiration pneumonia. It is more likely to occur if you have a swallowing problem, or if you are too sedated from the use of medication, alcohol, or other drugs.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Bronchopneumonia</h3>
                        <p>Bronchopneumonia can affect areas throughout both lungs. It's often localized close to or around the bronchi. These are the tubes that lead from the windpipe to the lungs.</p>

                        <p>Lobar pneumonia affects one or more lobes of the lungs. Each lung is made of lobes, which are defined sections of the lung.</p>
                        <p>Lobar pneumonia can be further divided into four stages based off how it's progressed:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Congestion.</strong> Lung tissue appears heavy and congested. Fluid filled with infectious organisms has accumulated in the air sacs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Red hepatization.</strong> Red bloods cells and immune cells have entered into the fluid. This makes the lungs appear red and solid in appearance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gray hepatization.</strong> The red blood cells have begun to break down while immune cells remain. The breakdown of red blood cells causes a change in color, from red to gray.</li>
                            <li><strong>Resolution.</strong> Immune cells have begun to clear the infection. A productive cough helps eject remaining fluid from the lungs.</li>

                            <li><strong>Chest X-ray</strong> - An X-ray helps look for signs of inflammation in the chest. If inflammation is present, the X-ray can also show its location and extent.</li>
                            <li><strong>Complete blood count</strong> - This is a blood sample taken for analysis to check for infections in the blood. If the infection is bacterial, the number of leucocytes will be high.</li>
                            <li><strong>Blood culture</strong> - This test uses a blood sample to confirm an infection. Culturing can also help identify what may be causing your condition.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sputum culture</strong> - During a sputum culture, a sample of mucus is collected after coughing deeply. It's then sent to a lab to be analyzed to identify the cause of the infection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pulse oximetry</strong> - A pulse oximetry measures the amount of oxygen in blood. A sensor placed on one of the fingers can indicate whether the lungs are moving enough oxygen through the bloodstream.</li>
                            <li><strong>CT scan</strong> - CT scans provide a clearer and more detailed picture of the lungs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fluid sample</strong> - If the doctor suspects there's fluid in the pleural space of the chest, they may take a fluid sample using a needle placed between the ribs. This test can help identify the cause of infection.</li>

                        <p>The first line of defense against pneumonia is to get vaccinated.</p>
                        <p>There are 2 vaccines that can helps prevent pneumonia.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prevnar 13 and pneumovax 23</li>
                            <li>These two pneumonia vaccines help protects against pneumonia and meningitis caused by pneumococcal bacteria.</li>
                            <li>Prevnar 13 is effective against 13 types of pneumococcal bacteria.</li>
                            <li>The CDC recommends this vaccine for;
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Children under age 2</li>
                                    <li>People between ages 2 and 64 with chronic conditions that increases their risk of pneumonia</li>
                                    <li>Adult ages 65 and older, on the recommended of their doctor</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Flu vaccine</strong> - Pneumonia can often be a complication of the flu, so be sure to also get annual flu shot.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hip vaccine</strong> - This vaccine protects against haemophiles influenzae type b (Hip), a type of bacterium that can cause pneumonia and meningitis</li>

                            <li>If you smoke, try to quit. Smoking makes you more susceptible to respiratory infections, especially pneumonia.</li>
                            <li>Maintain a healthy lifestyle to strengthen your immune system. Get enough rest, eat a balance diet and get regular exercise.</li>

                            <li><strong>Kidney, heart, and liver damage.</strong> These organs may be damaged if they don't receive enough oxygen, or if there's an overreaction of the immune system to the infection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Death.</strong> In some cases, pneumonia can be fatal. According to the CDC, nearly 44,000 people in the United States died from pneumonia in 2019</li>
