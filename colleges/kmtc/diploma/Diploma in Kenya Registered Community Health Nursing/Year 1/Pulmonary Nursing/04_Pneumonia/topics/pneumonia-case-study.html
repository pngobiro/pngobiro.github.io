                        <p>This is the main route of air entry, it consist of a large irregular cavity divided into two equal passages by a septum. The nasal lining consists of vascular ciliated columnar epithelium which contain mucus secreting goblet cell. The roof is formed by the cribriform plate of the the ethmoid bone and the sphenoid bone, frontal and nasal bone whereas the floor is formed by the roof of the mouth and consist of the hard palate in front and the soft palate behind and has involuntary muscle. The medial wall is formed by the septum and the lateral wall is formed by maxilla, ethmoid bone and inferior conchae. The posterior wall is composed of the pharynx.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Functions of the nose</h5>

                            <li>Warming of the air - The air is warmed due to immense vascularity of the nasal mucosa.</li>
                            <li>Filtering and cleaning of the air - The hairs at the anterior nares trap larger particles that settle and adhere onto the mucus.</li>
                            <li>The nose also plays a role in the sense of smell( olfaction)_ As the nerve endings that detect smell are allocated in the roof of the nose in the area of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bones and the superior conchae.</li>
                            <li>Humidification_This happens as air travels over moist mucosa, it becomes saturated with water vapour.</li>

                        <p>This is a tube 12-14 cm long that extends from the base of the skull to the level of the 6<sup>th</sup> cervical vertebrae. The pharynx lies behind the nose, mouth and larynx and is wider at its upper end. The pharynx is divided into:</p>
                        <ol type="A">
                            <li><strong>Nasopharynx:</strong> Is the nasal part which lies behind the nose. The lateral walls consist of two opening leading to each middle ear (auditory tubes). Posteriorly there are the pharyngeal tonsils (adenoids). They consist of lymphoid tissues and it is made up of ciliated columnar epithelium</li>
                            <li><strong>Oropharynx:</strong> Is the oral part which lies behind the mouth from below, at the level of soft palate to the level of upper part of the body of the third cervical vertebrae. During swallowing the oral and nasal parts are separated by soft palate and uvula. Oopharynx is made up stratified squamous epithelium.</li>
                            <li><strong>Laryngopharynx:</strong> Extends from oropharynx above and continuous as the esophagus below i.e. level of 3<sup>rd</sup>-6<sup>th</sup> cervical vertebrae and is made up stratified squamous epithelium.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The pharynx has submucosa which is rich in mucous associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) and it is also made up of smooth muscles.</p>

                            <li>Hearing - auditory tube extends from the nasopharynx to each middle ear, allowing air entry to the middle ear and since satisfactory hearing depends on the presence of air at atmospheric pressure on each side of the tympanic membrane (eardrum).</li>
                            <li>Taste - Pharynx has olfactory nerves for the sense of taste in the epithelium of oral and pharyngeal parts.</li>

                        <p>It links the laryngopharynx and the trachea .It lies in the level of the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> cervical vertebrae. The larynx is made up of irregular shaped cartilage attached to each other by the ligaments and the membranes. The cartilages are: 1 thyroid cartilage, 1cricoid cartilage, 2 arytenoid cartilages and 1 epiglottis cartilage which act as the lid of the larynx. The ligaments are: crico-arytenoid and cricothyroid and the membranes thyroaryoid and cricovocal. The interior part consists of vocal cord and between them there is a space called glottis.</p>
                        <p>The blood supply is by the superior and inferior laryngeal arteries and drained by the thyroid veins which joins the internal jugular vein.</p>

                        <p>It is the longest airway and it is approximately 10-11 cm long and lies mainly in the medial plane in the front of the oesophagus. It is a continuation of the larynx and extends downwards to about the level of 5<sup>th</sup> thoracic vertebrae where it divides at the carina into the left and the right primary bronchi. The blood supply is mainly by the inferior thyroid and bronchial arteries and the venous return is by the inferior thyroid veins into the brachiocephalic veins. Trachea is composed of three layers of tissues held open by 16 - 20 incomplete (C- shaped) rings of hyaline cartilage lying one above the other. They include:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">THE LUNGS</h4>
                        <p>There are two lungs which are cone-shaped organs, one on each side of the midline in the thoracic cavity. They have an apex, a base, a tip, costal surface and medial surface as follows:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Apex: Is the narrow superior tip of the lungs. It is rounded, rises into the root of the neck approximately 25 mm above the level of the middle third of the clavicle.</li>
                            <li>Base: It is concave, semi-lunar in shape lying on the upper thoracic surface of the diaphragm.</li>
                            <li>Costal surface: It is convex and lies directly against costal cartilage, the ribs and intercostals muscles.</li>
                            <li>Medial surface: It is concave, has a roughly triangular shaped area called hilum where the structures forming the root of the lung enter and leaves.</li>
                            <li>Mediastinum: Area between the two lungs which is occupied by the heart, the great vessels, trachea, bronchi, esophagus, lymph node, lymph vessels and nerves.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The right lung is bigger and is divided into three distinct lobes namely: Superior lobe, middle lobe and inferior lobe. The left lung is smaller because the heart occupies the left side, they are two distinct divisions including: The superior lobe and the inferior lobe. Divisions between the lobes are called the fissures.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Pleural and pleural cavity</h5>
                        <p>Pleura is a slippery serous membrane that helps the lungs to move smoothly during each breath. There are two layers namely:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Parietal pleura: Is adherent to the inside of the chest walls and thoracic surface of the diaphragm.</li>
                            <li>Visceral pleura: it is the inner layer which adheres to the lung covering each lobe and passing into fissures that separate them.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The pleural cavity - Is the space that separates the two pleura. It contains pleural fluid which is a thin film of serous fluid which allows the pleura to glide smoothly over each other as the lungs expand and contracts preventing friction during breathing. If either layer of the pleura is punctured, underlying lung collapses. Pleural cavity does not contain air.</p>
                        <p>Interior of the lungs : Consist of bronchi, bronchioles, blood vessels and lymph vessels, nerves and connective tissue all forming a lobe. Each lobe is made up of a large number of lobules.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Pulmonary blood supply</h5>
                        <p>The pulmonary vessel are divided into left and right pulmonary arteries; which carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs. Within the lungs each pulmonary artery divides into many branches, which eventually end in a dense capillary network around the alveoli walls. Exchange of gases between air in alveoli and blood in the capillary takes place between two very fine membranes called the respiratory membrane. The right pulmonary artery carries blood to the right lungs and the left pulmonary artery carries blood to the left lungs. The many capillaries join up to form the pulmonary vein in each lung that carries oxygenated blood to the left atrium of the heart.</p>
                        <p>Function_Holds the alveoli and provides medium for gaseous exchange.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">BRONCHI AND BRONCHIOLES</h4>
                        <p>The trachea divides at the level of the 5<sup>th</sup> thoracic vertebrae into two primary bronchi; The right bronchus and the left bronchus: The right bronchus is wider, shorter approximately 2.5 cm long and more vertical than the left hence more likely to become obstructed by an inhaled foreign body. It divides into three branches, one into each lobe and then subdivides further into smaller branches the bronchioles. The left bronchus is narrower than right and longer approximately 5 cm long. It enters the lung at the helium and divides into two one to each lobe and then subdivide into smaller airways the bronchioles. The blood supply is by the bronchiole arteries and venous return is by the bronchiole veins. The nerve supply is by the vagus nerve.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Functions of the bronchi and the bronchioles</h5>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">THE RESPIRATORY BRONCHIOLES AND ALVEOLI.</h4>
                        <p>Within each lobe, the lung tissue is further divided into lobules. Each lobe is supplied with air by a terminal bronchiole which further subdivides into respiratory bronchiole, the alveolar ducts and the large number of alveoli (air sacs). Each adult has approximately 150 million alveoli and here is where the process of gas exchange occurs. As the airway progressively subdivides and become smaller and smaller, there walls too becomes thinner and thinner until muscles and the connective tissue disappear leaving a single layer of simple squamous epithelium cells in the alveolar duct and alveoli. Between the squamous cells, there are septal cells which secrets a fluid called surfactant (phospholipid fluid) that prevents the alveoli from drying out, reduces the alveoli surface tension which helps to prevent alveoli wall from collapsing during expiration and facilitate expansion of lung and establishment of respiration in the newborn. The secretion of surfactant begins in the 35<sup>th</sup> week of fetal life. This explains breathing problem in premature lungs.</p>

Carbon dioxide diffuses from venous blood down its concentration gradient into the alveoli until equilibrium with alveoli air is achieved.</p>

Blood from the lungs is saturated with oxygen, unlike the tissue. This creates concentration gradient between capillaries blood and tissues therefore gaseous exchange takes place. Oxygen diffuses from blood stream through capillary walls into the tissues the same way carbon dioxide diffuses from the cells into extracellular fluids then into the blood stream towards the venous end of the capillaries.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">MUSCLES OF BREATHING</h3>
                        <p>There are two main muscles of breathing. They include:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Intercostals muscles:</strong> - This muscle accounts for 25% of breathing. They are arranged into two layers forming the internal and external intercostals muscles. There are 11 pairs lying between the ribs (occupy the spaces between the ribs). External intercostals muscles are useful in inspiration. They are stimulated to contract by the intercostals nerves. On contraction they extend downwards and forward. This elevates the lower ribs and pushes the sternum outwards.<br>Intercostals muscles are used when expiration becomes active for example during exercise. On contraction they extend downwards and backwards.</li>
                            <li><strong>Diaphragm:</strong> - it is the most important muscle of breathing which is supplied by phrenic nerves. The diaphragm accounts for about 75% of the breathing. When the diaphragm is stimulated by the phrenic nerves to contract, it increases the size of the chest wall thus expands the lungs by lengthening the thoracic cavity. This helps in inspiration.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">ACCESSORY MUSCLES OF BREATHING</h3>
                        <p>These muscles are mostly used during straineous breathing; they include:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li><strong>Abdominal muscles:</strong> - Used in active expiration. They pull the rib cage downwards and inwards and pushes the diaphragm upwards squeezing the abdominal content hence increasing the pressure of the thorax.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scalene muscles and Starnocledomastoid muscle:</strong> They are both useful in active inspiration. They increase the expansion of the rib cage.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CYCLE OF BREATHING</h3>
                        <p>The average respiratory rate is 16-18breaths/minute.Breathing dependent upon changes in pressure in the thoracic cavity. Lungs and chest wall are elastic structures.Breathing follow the underlying physical principle that increasing the volume of a container decreases pressure inside the container. Air flow from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure therefore pressure inside the lungs determines the direction of air flow. Each breath consists of three phases namely:</p>
                        <ol type="A">
                            <li><strong>Inspiration:</strong> - This is an active process hence energy is used to contract the muscles. It lasts for about 2 seconds. It involves simultaneous contraction of the external intercostals muscles and the diaphragm to expand the thorax. This increases the intra thoracic volume and decreases intra thoracic pressure. This in turn increases the intra pleural pressure at the base of the lungs. The lung tissue is pulled upwards and outwards with the ribs and down wards with the diaphragm. This expands the lungs and in turn decreases pressure within alveoli and air passages. This draws air into the lungs in an attempt to equalize the atmospheric and alveoli pressure. The negative pressure created in the thoracic cavity aids venous return to the heart and it is called respiratory pump.</li>
                            <li><strong>Expiration:</strong> - This is a passive process which does not require energy. Relaxation of the muscles lasts for about 3 seconds. It involves relaxation of the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm. Their relaxation results in downward and inward movement of the ribcage. This decreases the volume of the thoracic cavity and therefore increases pressure. In return the volume of the lungs increases because the lungs recoil. This increases pressure in the lungs and expels air from the respiratory tract. The lungs will still contain some air to prevent their incomplete collapse together with the pleura.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pause:</strong> - After expiration, there is a pause before the next cycle begins. It lasts for about 1-2 seconds.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><strong>INCUBATION PERIOD:</strong> The incubation period for the community acquired pneumonia is 2_10 days.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p>Pneumonia is transmitted through the following ways:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Inhalation:</strong> Microorganisms are suspended in water droplets and sprayed in air with coughing, sneezing and talking especially viral pneumonia. The water droplets remain suspended in the air long enough for water to evaporate leaving a droplet nucleus including microorganisms. When these microorganisms are inhaled they overcome the lung defense mechanisms and the lung becomes inflamed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Circulatory spread:</strong> This occurs when pathogens are transmitted through the circulatory system to the lungs from the pre-existing infection from other body parts especially in immunosupressed patients with lung disease for example septicaemia and endocarditis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Aspiration:</strong> The transmission is through microorganisms from oropharynx and the gastrointestinal tract gets into the lungs by direct contact especially bacterial pneumonia. This is common in those with disorders of oesophagus, diminished gangle and cough reflex and those on endotracheal or nasogastric tube.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">RISK FACTORS TO PNEUMONIA</h3>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Age : The old aged and infants are at high risk of pneumonia due to decline in the immunological system.</li>
                            <li>Alcoholics: Drug abuses and patients with neurologic problems for example impaired gangle or swallowing reflexes are at risk of aspiration pneumonia.</li>
                            <li>Nil per oral status: The patient can be on nasogastric tube or endotracheal tube; here there is depressed cough reflex.</li>
                            <li>Prevalence of underlying disease for example chronic respiratory disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, cardiac failure or renal failure makes the body's defense weak.</li>
                            <li>Nutritional deficit: If severe can predispose to pneumonia.</li>
                            <li>Smoking: Destructs the ciliar, mucociliary and macrophages activities.</li>
                            <li>Immunosupression: Has high risk of opportunistic infections due to the compromised immunity.</li>
                            <li>General anaesthesia, sedatives or opioid preparations promote respiratory depression.</li>
                            <li>Prolonged immobility and shallow breathing patterns: This leads to atelectasis hence complicating pneumonia.</li>
                            <li>Sometimes antibiotics can lead to pneumonia especially in the very sick patients whereby oropharynx is relatively likely to be colonized by gram negative bacteria.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CLASSIFICATION OF PNEUMONIA</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Causal agent</strong>- Is the most common and relevant classification of pneumonia. It can be: Bacterial pneumonia caused by bacteria, viral pneumonia caused by virus and fungal pneumonia caused by fungi.</li>
                            <li><strong>Clinical presentation</strong>_ can be a typical or typical; a typical pneumonia is whereby there is a gradual insidious onset of symptoms that are not very specific to pneumonia i.e headache, sorethroat, muscle soreness, dry cough and fatigue. Whereas typical pneumonia there is classical manifestation of pneumonia i.e abrupt onset of fever, shaking chills, productive cough and chest pains.</li>
                            <li><strong>According to anatomical location:</strong> They include; Lobular pneumonia which refers to patchy consolidation of the lung which may be limited to one lobe but generally includes both the lungs or more than one lobe. The other one is lobar pneumonia which refers to the infection of the entire lobe or a major portion of the lobe.</li>
                            <li><strong>According to the place of acquisition:</strong> Are hospital acquired pneumonia this occurs in hospital setup whereby the onset of pneumonia symptoms occurs after 48 hours of hospital admission. It is mostly caused by Staphylococcus aureas, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia. The other one is community acquired pneumonia; this occurs within the community setting or within 48 hours of admission, is mostly caused by Streptococcus pneumonia.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">ETIOLOGY</h3>
                        <p>Pneumonia results from interaction between the pathogens and host. This occurs when the respiratory system is exposed infectious organisms i.e viruses, bacteria and fungi. The most common are Streptococcal pneumonia which is the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in children.</p>
                        <p>Hemophilus influenza type B; the second most common cause of bacterial pneumonia, respiratory syncytical virus is the most viral cause of pneumonia.</p>
                        <p>In infants infected with HIV/AIDs ,pneumocystis jiroveci is one of the commonest cause of pneumonia , responsible for about a quarter of HIV infected infants.</p>
                        <p>Fungal pneumonia; the most common is Histoplasma capsulatum which causes histoplasmosis.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">EPIDEMIOLOGY</h3>
                        <p>Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lungs. Pneumonia is a worldwide public health problem affecting mostly the under five years more so in the developing countries hence closely associated with poverty, malnutrition, substandard housing and inadequate health care. Mortality and morbidity rates continue to rise as a result as the rate accounts for more than 2 million deaths per year.</p>
                        <p>In developed countries, the mortality rate is low less than 1 per 1000 per year. In Kenya on average day 1 in 12 children suffer from pneumonia. According to the available data from Bill and Melinda Foundation, pneumonia kills 30,000 children every year and many more are left with permanent disabilities despite the launch of pneumonia vaccine.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</h3>
                        <p>Pneumonia generally refers to the inflammation of the lung parenchyma and is associated with the production of exudates. When the bacteria causing pneumonia enters into the lung with inhalation, aspiration or through circulatory spread, they reach the lungs through the blood stream if other parts of the body are infected .Often the bacteria lives in the upper respiratory tract and is constantly being inhaled into the alveoli, once in the alveoli the bacteria travels into the space between the cells and also between the adjacent alveoli through connecting pores .This triggers an inflammatory reaction sending the white blood cells and neutrophils which are responsible to attack the pathogens invading the lungs .The neutrophils engulf and kills microorganisms but they also release cytokines which results in the general activation of the immune system thus resulting to fever, fatigue and chills. The neutrophils,bacteria and fluid leaked from the surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli and results to impaired oxygen transportation by causing edema which results to decreased alveoli oxygen tension thus the venous blood passing through the infected air spaces are under ventilated, the blood then returns to the heart poorly oxygenated due to arteio-venous shunting hence leading to arterial hypoxaemia.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CLINICAL MANIFESTATION</h3>
                        <h4>Key signs and symptoms include:</h4>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Shortness of breath especially when patient is reclining.</li>
                            <li>Tachypnea (25 to 45 breaths in a minute).</li>
                            <li>Chest pains especially when breathing or coughing</li>
                            <li>Cough which can be productive</li>
                            <li>Fevers (38.5-42.8 degrees celcius)</li>
                            <li>Dyspnea- difficulty in breathing</li>
                            <li>Weak pulse, lethargic or confused.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">COMPLICATIONS</h3>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Respiratory failure and shock:</strong> - hypotension and shock occur mostly in gram negative bacteria disease in elderly patients. It can also result when the infecting organism is resistant to therapy and when disease complicates the pneumonia. Congestive heart failure, cardiac dysrythmias, pericarditis and myocarditis also are complications of pneumonia which may lead to shock.</li>
                            <li><strong>Empyema and pleural effusion</strong>-Pneumonia is the buildup of fluid caused infection in the lungs. When the infection sets in, fluid begins to buildup between the membranes that cover the lungs and the chest wall hence causing the pleura to become inflamed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bacteremia</strong>-This happens when the pneumonia is bacteria in nature.The bacteria spreads to the blood hence leading to further complications.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pneumothorax</strong>- Occurs when air from the inside the lungs leak into the pleura space between the chest wall and the lungs.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">PREVENTION AND CONTROL</h3>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Vacination with haemophilus influenza type B/ pneumococcal vaccines at 6, 10 and 14 weeks to children under the age of five years.</li>
                            <li>Practice of hygiene; for example hand washing with clean water and soap.</li>
                            <li>Stoppage of smoking</li>
                            <li>Early screening and prompt treatment of the respiratory illnesses.</li>
                            <li>Health education to include early detection, medical adherence and predisposing factors.</li>
                            <li>Offering proper ventilation in homes, houses, hospitals, and discouraging overcrowding. This will reduce the microorganism causing pneumonia available in the air we breathe in.</li>

                        <p><strong>Classification:</strong> - It is a non opioid analgesic (a week cyclo- oxygenese enzyme 1 and 2 inhibitor). It is also an antipyretic drug.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mode of action:</strong> - they work by inhibiting the prostaglandins which are responsible for inflammation reaction. Some inhibit the cyclo - oxygenase enzyme which facilitates the production of prostaglandins. They act as antipyretics by acting directly on the hypothalamic heatregulating center to cause vasodilatation and sweating which helps in reducing heat.</p>
                        <p><strong>Indication:</strong> - Analgesic/antipyretic in patients with Aspirin allergy, hemostatic disturbances, upper gastro intestinal disease, biliary tract and genital urinary organs and is also being used in common cold/flu/other viral and bacterial infections with pain and fever.</p>

                        <p>The child was discharged and given a return date on 16<sup>th</sup> April, 2014.I made a phone call on 14<sup>th</sup> /4/2014, it was on Monday at around 11:38am I greeted her and asked how they were doing at home and how the baby was doing too. She then told me that they were fine and the child was doing well and she is continuing with giving him his medications. She reported that she has not noted any episodes of hotness of the body and the child is breastfeeding well and also plays a lot.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">EVALUATION</h3>
                        <p>The case study was generally successful in that the mother of the child was cooperative and she was ready and willing to give me the information I required to write this case study. The nurses in the paediatric ward also helped me with the relevant information I needed.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY</h3>
                        <p>This case study has helped me to learn more about pneumonia which is the inflammation of the lung parenchyma and can lead to serious complications. I therefore conclude that all mothers should be educated about the various ways of managing and preventing pneumonia, especially the need for vaccinating the children under 5 years of age with the pneumococcal vaccine, and the importance of child welfare clinic (CWC) until the child is 5 years old for the clinics are useful and helps to detect any problems earlier.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">RECOMMENDATION</h3>
                        <p>The case study gave me an opportunity to learn more about causes, management, prevention and control of pneumonia as a condition.</p>
                        <p>More time should be given to students to do a thorough care study since it entails typing and printing.</p>
