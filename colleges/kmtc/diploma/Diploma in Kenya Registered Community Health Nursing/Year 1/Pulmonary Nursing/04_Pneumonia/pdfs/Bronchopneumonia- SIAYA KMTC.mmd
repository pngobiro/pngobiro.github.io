\section*{Bronchopneumonia}

\section*{SYLVIA NANJALA SIMIYU}

\section*{BRONCHOPNEUMONIA}
- Pneumonia that is distributed in a patchy fashion, having originated in one or more localized areas within the bronchi and extending to adjacent lung parenchyma caused by various micro-organisms
- Pneumonia - inflammation of lung parenchyma caused by various microorganisms

\section*{Pathophysiology of bronchopneumonia}
- Starts with normal/ harmful flora in upper respiratory tract, which are then aspirated into the lungs
- May also start with blood-borne organisms that enter the pulmonary circulation and are trapped in pulmonary capillary bed.
- It may also occur as a complication of chicken pox, measles, diphtheria, typhoid fever and acute broncholitis

\section*{Pathophysiology of bronchopneumonia}
- Inflammatory reaction occurs in the alveoli, producing exudate, which interferes with diffusion of oxygen and carbon-dioxide
- WBCs (neutrophils), migrate into alveoli and fill the normally air filled alveoli
- There's poor ventilation in lungs due to secretions and mucosal edemaleading to partial occlusion of bronchi

\section*{Pathophysiology of bronchopneumonia}
- Bronchospasms may occur with patients with pre-existing airway disease e.g. asthma
- Hypoventilation occurs leading to hypoxemia

\section*{Clinical features of bronchopneumonia}
- Sudden onset of chills with rapidly rising fevers of 38.5-40.5degrees Celsius
- Pleuritic chest pain aggravated by deep breathing and coughing
- Tachypnea
- Rapid bounding pulse
- Relative bradycardia
- Some have upper respiratory tract infection e.g. nasal congestion, sore throat
- Headache, low grade fever, pleuritic chest pain, myalgia, rash, pharyngitis

\section*{Management}
1. Administration of appropriate anti-infective- antibiotics, antifungals or antivirals depending on causative agent.
2. Good nursing care
3. Bed rest
4. Suction to remove secretions from tracheobronchial tree
5. Oxygen
6. Symptomatic treatment for cough, restlessness, fever and pain
7. Adequate fluid and dietary intake
8. Treatment of congestive cardiac failure, if present.
9. Physiotherapy: Breathing exercise during recovery are of value. 10Surgical intervention may be needed in subjects who have developed complications like empyema or tension pneumothorax.
