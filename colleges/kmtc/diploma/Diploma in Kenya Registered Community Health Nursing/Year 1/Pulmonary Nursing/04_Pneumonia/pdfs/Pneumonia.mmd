Pneumonia.

\section*{Introduction.}
- Pneumonia is an infection in one or both lungs caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi.
- The infection leads to inflammation in the air sacs of the lungs, which are called alveoli. The alveoli filled with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe.
- Both viral or bacterial pneumonia are contagious; This means they can spread from person to person through inhalation of airborne or droplets from a sneeze or cough.
- Pneumonia can affect one or both lungs. Pneumonia in both of your lungs is called bilateral or double pneumonia
- While all pneumonia is inflammation caused by an infection in the lungs, one may have different symptoms depending on whether the root cause is a virus, bacteria or fungi.
- Bacterial pneumonia tends to be more common and more severe than viral pneumonia. It's more likely to require a hospital stay. Bacterial pneumonia is usually treated with antibiotics. Viral pneumonia causes flu-like symptoms and is more likely to resolve on its own. You usually don't need specific treatment for viral pneumonia.

\section*{Types of pneumonia}
1. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This refers to pneumonia that is acquired outside of a medical/healthcare institution. Causes include;
- Bacteria: Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, also called pneumococcal disease, is the most common cause of CAP. Pneumococcal disease can also cause ear infections, sinus infections and meningitis. Mycoplasma pneumoniae bacteria causes atypical pneumonia, which usually has milder symptoms. Other bacteria that cause CAP include Haemophilus influenza, Chlamydia

\section*{Cont'}
- Viruses: Viruses that cause the common cold, the flu (influenza), COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can sometimes lead to pneumonia.
- Fungi (molds): Fungi, like Cryptococcus, Pneumocystis jirovecii and Coccidioides, are uncommon causes of pneumonia. People with compromised immune systems are most at risk of getting pneumonia from a fungus.
- Protozoa: Rarely, protozoa like Toxoplasma cause pneumonia.
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). This type of bacterial pneumonia is acquired during a hospital stay. It can be more serious than other types, as the bacteria involved may be more resistant to antibiotics. It is often caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, like methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). When people who are using ventilator get pneumonia, it is called VAP.
- The same types of bacteria as community-acquired pneumonia, as well as the drug-resistant kinds that cause hospital-acquired pneumonia, cause VAP.
- 4.Aspiration pneumonia. Inhaling bacteria into your lungs from food, drink or saliva can cause aspiration pneumonia. It is more likely to occur if you have a swallowing problem, or if you are too sedated from the use of medication, alcohol, or other drugs.
- Walking pneumonia
- It is a milder case of pneumonia
- People with walking pneumonia may not know even they have pneumonia.
- Their symptoms may have more like a mild respiratory infection than pneumonia. However, walking pneumonia may require a longer recovery period.

\section*{Signs and Symptoms}
- Symptoms of pneumonia depend on the cause. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. Babies, young children and older adults may have different symptoms.
- Symptoms of bacterial pneumonia
- Symptoms of bacterial pneumonia can develop gradually or suddenly. Symptoms include:
- High fever (up to 105 F or 40.55 C).
- Cough with yellow, green or bloody mucus.
- Tiredness (fatigue).
- Rapid breathing.
- Shortness of breath.
- Rapid heart rate.
- Sweating or chills.
- Chest pain and/or abdominal pain, especially with coughing or deep breathing.
- Loss of appetite.
- Bluish skin, lips or nails (cyanosis).
- Confusion or altered mental state.
- Symptoms of viral pneumonia
- Symptoms of viral pneumonia usually develop over several days. You might have symptoms similar to bacterial pneumonia or you might additionally have:
- Dry cough.
- Headache.
- Muscle pain.
- Extreme tiredness or weakness.

\section*{- Symptoms of pneumonia in young children}
- Babies and newborns may not show any symptoms of pneumonia or their symptoms may be different from adults, including:
- Fever, chills, general discomfort, sweating/flushed skin.
- Cough.
- Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing (tachypnea).
- Loss of appetite.
- Vomiting.
- Lack of energy.
- Restlessness or fussiness.

\section*{Stages of pneumonia}
- Pneumonia may be classified based off the area of the lungs it's affecting:
- Bronchopneumonia
- Bronchopneumonia can affect areas throughout both lungs. It's often localized close to or around the bronchi. These are the tubes that lead from the windpipe to the lungs.

\section*{- Lobar pneumonia}
- Lobar pneumonia affects one or more lobes of the lungs. Each lung is made of lobes, which are defined sections of the lung.
- Lobar pneumonia can be further divided into four stages based off how it's progressed:
- Congestion. Lung tissue appears heavy and congested. Fluid filled with infectious organisms has accumulated in the air sacs.
- Red hepatization. Red bloods cells and immune cells have entered into the fluid. This makes the lungs appear red and solid in appearance.
- Gray hepatization. The red blood cells have begun to break down while immune cells remain. The breakdown of red blood cells causes a change in color, from red to gray.
- Resolution. Immune cells have begun to clear the infection. A productive cough helps eject remaining fluid from the lungs.

\section*{Differential diagnosis}
- It is the progress of differentiating between one or more conditions which share similar signs and symptoms.
- The differential diagnosis include:
- Pulmonary infarction
- Pulmonary/ pleural TB
- Pulmonary oedema (can be unilateral)
- Venous thromboembolism, pulmonary hemorrhage
- ARDS
- Drug toxicity
- Acute bronchitis
- Chronic bronchitis with acute exacerbation
- Heart failure
- Pulmonary embolism
- Hypersensitivity pneumonia

\section*{Investigations}
- These are laboratory tests and imaging done to ascertain the cause of disease.
- Chest X-ray
- An X-ray helps look for signs of inflammation in the chest. If inflammation is present, the X-ray can also show its location and extent.
- Complete blood count
- This is a blood sample taken for analysis to check for infections in the blood. If the infection is bacterial, the number of leucocytes will be high.
- Blood culture
- This test uses a blood sample to confirm an infection. Culturing can also help identify what may be causing your condition.
- Sputum culture
- During a sputum culture, a sample of mucus is collected after coughing deeply. It's then sent to a lab to be analyzed to identify the cause of the infection.
- Pulse oximetry
- A pulse oximetry measures the amount of oxygen in blood. A sensor placed on one of the fingers can indicate whether the lungs are moving enough oxygen through the bloodstream.

\section*{- CT scan}
- CT scans provide a clearer and more detailed picture of the lungs.
- Fluid sample
- If the doctor suspects there's fluid in the pleural space of the chest, they may take a fluid sample using a needle placed between the ribs. This test can help identify the cause of infection.
- Bronchoscopy
- A bronchoscopy looks into the airways in the lungs. It does this using a camera on the end of a flexible tube that's gently guided down the throat and into the lungs.
- The doctor may do this test if initial symptoms are severe, or if patient is hospitalized and not responding well to antibiotics.

\section*{Prevention}
- Vaccination
- The first line of defense against pneumonia is to get vaccinated.
- There are 2 vaccines that can helps prevent pneumonia.
- Prevnar 13 and pneumovax 23
- These two pneumonia vaccines help protects against pneumonia and meningitis caused by pneumococcal bacteria.
- Prevnar 13 is effective against 13 types of pneumococcal bacteria.
- The CDC recommends this vaccine for;
- Children under age 2
- People between ages 2 and 64 with chronic conditions that increases their risk of pneumonia
- Adult ages 65 and older, on the recommended of their doctor
- Flu vaccine
- Pneumonia can often be a complication of the flu, so be sure to also get annual flu shot.
- Hip vaccine
- This vaccine protects against haemophiles influenzae type b (Hip), a type of bacterium that can cause pneumonia and meningitis

\section*{Other prevention tips}
- Cover your coughs and sneezes. Promptly disposed tissues
- Regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
- If you smoke, try to quit. Smoking makes you more susceptible to respiratory infections, especially pneumonia.
- Maintain a healthy lifestyle to strengthen your immune system. Get enough rest, eat a balance diet and get regular exercise.

\section*{Management of pneumonia}
- Antibiotics; are used to treat bacterial pneumonia. Example is amoxicillin
- Cough medicine; used to calm cough for one to rest.
- Fever reducers/ pain relievers; for fever and discomfort eg aspirin and acetaminophen etc
- Hospitalization is recommended for severe cases of pneumonia.
- Oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen is low.
- Get pneumonia vaccination
- Appropriately treating underlying illness (such as HIV/AIDs, diabetes, mellitus and malnutrition) can decrease the risk of vaccination.
- Practice good hygiene.

\section*{Complications of pneumonia}
- Worsened chronic conditions. If have certain preexisting health conditions, pneumonia could make them worse. These conditions include congestive heart failure and emphysema. For certain people, pneumonia increases their risk of having a heart attack.
- Bacteremia. Bacteria from the pneumonia infection may spread to your bloodstream. This can lead to dangerously low blood pressure, septic shock, and, in some cases organ failure.
- Lung abscesses. These are cavities in the lungs that contains pus. Antibiotics can treat them. Sometimes they may require drainage or surgery to remove the pus.
- Impaired breathing. You may have trouble getting enough oxygen when you breathe. You may need to use a ventilator.
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome. This is a severe form of respiratory failure. It's a medical emergency.
- Pleural effusion. If your pneumonia isn't treated, you may develop fluid around your lungs in your pleura, called pleural effusion. The pleura are thin membranes that line the outside of your lungs and the inside of your rib cage. The fluid may become infected and need to be drained
- Kidney, heart, and liver damage. These organs may be damaged if they don't receive enough oxygen, or if there's an overreaction of the immune system to the infection.
- Death. In some cases, pneumonia can be fatal. According to the CDC, nearly 44,000 people in the United States died from pneumonia in 2019
