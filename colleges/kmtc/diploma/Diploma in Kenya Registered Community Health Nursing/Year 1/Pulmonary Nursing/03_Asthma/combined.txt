\section*{WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT ASTHMA?}

Asthma is a common and potentially serious chronic disease that can be controlled but not cured
Asthma causes symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time in their occurrence, frequency and intensity
Symptoms are associated with variable expiratory airflow, i.e. difficulty breathing air out of the lungs due to

Bronchoconstriction (airway narrowing)
Airway wall thickening
Increased mucus
Symptoms may be triggered or worsened by factors such as viral infections, allergens, tobacco smoke, exercise and stress

\section*{WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT ASTHMA?}

Asthma can be effectively treated When asthma is well-controlled, patients can

> Avoid troublesome symptoms during the day and night
> Need little or no reliever medication
> Have productive, physically active lives
> Have normal or near-normal lung function
> Avoid serious asthma flare-ups (also called exacerbations, or severe attacks)

\section*{DEFINITION OF ASTHMA}

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation.

It is defined by the history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation.

\section*{ACUTE ASTHMATIC ATTACK}

Acute or subacute episodes of progressively worsening symptoms and airflow obstruction

Airflow obstruction during exacerbations can become extensive, resulting in life-threatening respiratory insufficiency

Often, asthma exacerbations worsen during sleep (between midnight and 8 am) when airways inflammation and hyperresponsiveness are at their peak

A severe exacerbation that does not improve with standard therapy is termed status asthmaticus

\section*{EPIDEMIOLOGY}

The most common chronic disease in childhood.

Affects $\sim 300 \mathrm{~m}$ people worldwide Prevalence has been rising last 30 years Prevalence varies from 1-18\%

Peak age of 3 years
In children M:F = 2:1, adults 1:1
Deaths from asthma have been declining in most countries especially with the use of ICS

\section*{CONT,}

\section*{Affects about 10\% of the Kenyan population(4 million)}

Prevalence in older children between $12-14 \mathrm{yrs}$ may be increasing

1995- prevalence was 17.1\% and 10.4\% in Nairobi and Eldoret respectively.

\section*{CONT,}

2000- prevalence was 18\% and 13.8\%2

Is more prevalent in urban than rural areas

No population based study on asthma prevalence in children below 10yrs or those over 15

No data on the burden of asthma that is managed routinely in the health care system.

\section*{CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF ASTHMA}

A chronic inflammatory disorder of the airway
Infiltration of mast cells, eosinophils and lymphocytes
Airway hyperresponsiveness to a variety of stimuli
Recurrent episodes of wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath
Widespread, variable and often reversible airflow limitation

\section*{DIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA}

The diagnosis of asthma should be based on:
A history of characteristic symptom patterns Evidence of variable airflow limitation, from bronchodilator reversibility testing or other tests
Document evidence for the diagnosis in the patient's notes, preferably before starting controller treatment

It is often more difficult to confirm the diagnosis after treatment has been started
Asthma is usually characterized by airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness, but these are not necessary or sufficient to make the diagnosis of asthma.

\section*{DIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA - SYMPTOMS}

Increased probability that symptoms are due to asthma if:
More than one type of symptom (wheeze, shortness of breath, cough, chest tightness)
Symptoms often worse at night or in the early morning
Symptoms vary over time and in intensity
Symptoms are triggered by viral infections, exercise, allergen exposure, changes in weather, laughter, irritants such as car exhaust fumes, smoke, or strong smells
Decreased probability that symptoms are due to asthma if:
Isolated cough with no other respiratory symptoms
Chronic production of sputum
Shortness of breath associated with dizziness, light-headedness or peripheral tingling
Chest pain
Exercise-induced dyspnea with noisy inspiration (stridor)

\section*{DIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA - VARIABLE AIRFLOW}

\section*{LIMITATION}

Confirm presence of airflow limitation
Document that $\mathrm{FEV}_{1} / \mathrm{FVC}$ is reduced (at least once, when $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ is low)
FEV 1 / FVC ratio is normally $>0.75-0.80$ in healthy adults, and $>0.90$ in children
Confirm variation in lung function is greater than in healthy individuals

The greater the variation, or the more times variation is seen, the greater probability that the diagnosis is asthma
Excessive bronchodilator reversibility (adults: increase in $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}>12 \%$ and $>200 \mathrm{~mL}$; children: increase $>12 \%$ predicted)
Excessive diurnal variability from 1-2 weeks' twice-daily PEF monitoring (daily amplitude $\times 100$ /daily mean, averaged)
Significant increase in FEV ${ }_{1}$ or PEF after 4 weeks of controller treatment
If initial testing is negative:
Repeat when patient is symptomatic, or after withholding bronchodilators Refer for additional tests (especially children $\leq 5$ years, or the elderly)

\section*{DIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA - PHYSICAL \\ EXAMINATION}

Physical examination in people with asthma
Often normal
The most frequent finding is wheezing on auscultation, especially on forced expiration
Wheezing is also found in other conditions, for example:
Respiratory infections
COPD
Upper airway dysfunction
Endobronchial obstruction
Inhaled foreign body
Wheezing may be absent during severe asthma exacerbations ('silent chest')

\section*{THE ROLE OF LUNG FUNCTION IN ASTHMA}

Diagnosis
Demonstrate variable expiratory airflow limitation
Reconsider diagnosis if symptoms and lung function are discordant
Frequent symptoms but normal $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ : cardiac disease; lack of fitness?
Few symptoms but low $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ : poor perception; restriction of lifestyle?
Risk assessment
Low $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ is an independent predictor of exacerbation risk
Monitoring progress
Measure lung function at diagnosis, 3-6 months after starting treatment
(to identify personal best), and then periodically
Consider long-term PEF monitoring for patients with severe asthma or impaired perception of airflow limitation
Adjusting treatment?
Utility of lung function for adjusting treatment is limited by between-visit variability of $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ (15\% year-to-year)

\section*{ASSESSING ASTHMA SEVERITY}

How?
Asthma severity is assessed retrospectively from the level of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations
When?
Assess asthma severity after patient has been on controller treatment for several months
Severity is not static - it may change over months or years, or as different treatments become available
Categories of asthma severity
Mild asthma: well-controlled with Steps 1 or 2 (as-needed SABA or low dose ICS)
Moderate asthma: well-controlled with Step 3 (low-dose ICS/LABA)
Severe asthma: requires Step 4/5 (moderate or high dose ICS/LABA $\pm$ add-on), or remains uncontrolled despite this treatment
ICS- inhahed corticosteroids
SABA- short acting beta agonist
LABA-long acting beta agonist

\section*{ASSESSMENT OF ASTHMA}

\section*{ASSESSMENT OF ASTHMA}
1. Asthma control - two domains

Assess symptom control over the last 4 weeks
Assess risk factors for poor outcomes, including low lung function
2. Treatment issues

Check inhaler technique and adherence
Ask about side-effects
Does the patient have a written asthma action plan?
What are the patient's attitudes and goals for their asthma?
3. Comorbidities

Think of rhinosinusitis, GERD, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, anxiety
These may contribute to symptoms and poor quality of life

\section*{TREATING ASTHMA TO CONTROL ŞMPTOMS AND MINIMIZE RISKK}

\section*{GOALS OF ASTHMA MANAGEMENT}

The long-term goals of asthma management are
1. Symptom control: to achieve good control of symptoms and maintain normal activity levels
2. Risk reduction: to minimize future risk of exacerbations, fixed airflow limitation and medication side-effects
Achieving these goals requires a partnership between patient and their health care providers

Ask the patient about their own goals regarding their asthma
Good communication strategies are essential
Consider the health care system, medication availability, cultural and personal preferences and health literacy

\section*{SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS}

The presence of multiple key indicators increases the probability of asthma, but spirometry is needed to establish
a diagnosis.
Wheezing-NB: A lack of wheezing and a normal chest examination do not exclude asthma.

History of any of the following:
- Cough (worse particularly at night)
- Recurrent wheeze
- Recurrent difficulty in breathing
- Recurrent chest tightness

\section*{SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS}

\section*{Symptoms occur or worsen in the presence of:}
- Exercise
- Viral infection
- Inhalant allergens (e.g., animals with fur or hair, house-dust mites, mould, pollen)
- Irritants (tobacco or wood smoke, airborne chemicals)
- Changes in weather
- Strong emotional expression (laughing or crying hard)
- Stress
- Menstrual cycles

\section*{Symptoms occur or worsen at night, awakening the patient}

\section*{TRIGGERS}

\section*{EXAM}

\section*{Vital signs and pulse oximetry}

Assessment of level of consciousness, anxiety, and agitation;

Assessment of breathlessness, wheezing, air entry, accessory muscle use, and retractions

\section*{INVESTIGATIONS}

Peak flow rate - used to assess airflow obstruction, providing an objective assessment of disease severity.
CXR- Useful in excluding pneumonia/ pneumothorax in patients with findings such as crepitations, fever, decreased breath sounds and in severe disease. ABG- hypercapnia, hypoxemia; rarely changes mode of management.

\section*{SPIROMETRY}

Spirometry can demonstrate obstruction and assess:-
Reversibility in patients over 5 years of age.
Patients' perceptions of airflow obstruction are highly variable.
Spirometry is an essential objective measure to establish the diagnosis of asthma

\section*{SUPPORTIVE CARE}

Supplemental oxygen \& fluids are necessary, and frequent monitoring of response to therapy

Humidified oxygen should be provided as needed to maintain an oxygen saturation of $\geq$ 92\%

All nebulized medications should also be delivered with oxygen, generally at a flow rate of 6-8 L/min

\section*{MONITORING}

The frequency of monitoring varies depending upon the severity of illness \& response to initial therapy; typically every 20 - 30 mins for the first hour of therapy

Ongoing monitoring of respiratory \& heart rates, oxygen saturation, degree of alertness, accessory muscle use, retractions \& PEFR (in children who are able to perform it)
PEFR-peak expiratory flow rate

COMBINATIONS
Salmeterol/Fluticasone Formoterol/Budesonide Salbutamol/Beclomethasone

\section*{INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS (ICS); CONSIDERATIONS IN CHILDREN}

Growth - at low-medium doses ICS
Small reduction in growth ( 1 cm ) only during first year, non-progressive thereafter No difference in final height of those treated with budesonide, their siblings or control subjects (RCT) Poorly controlled asthma has a greater potential of reducing growth than ICS use
Local side effects (rare in young children)
Thrush, dysphonia - minimize by wiping peri-oral skin and rinsing mouth after inhalation
Bone density - no effect (low-medium dose)

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY - ICS PAEDIATRIC DOSING CONSIDERATIONS}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Inhaled glucocorticosteroid & Low daily dose & Medium daily dose & High daily dose \\
\hline Budesonide (MDI 100 or $200 \mathrm{mcg} /$ puff DPI 80 or 160 mcg ) & 200 mcg & 400 mcg & $\geq 800 \mathrm{mcg}$ \\

\hline Ciclesonide (80 or 160 mcg/puff)* above 6 yr & 80 mcg & 160 mcg & $\geq 320 \mathrm{mcg}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Long-acting beta-agonist (LABA)}

LABAs relax airway smooth muscle but NO anti-inflammatory activity
Add LABA to low or medium-dose ICS as step-up in poorly controlled child
More "bang for your buck" than increasing the dose of ICS beyond medium dose
Potential adverse effects:
Tachycardia, tremor, insomnia
Paradoxical increase in serious asthma exacerbations in some patients due to downregulation of $\beta_{2}$-receptors (less relief from salbutamol!)
Bottomline: Always combine ICS/LABA

\section*{Leukotriene antagonists}

Used as step-up in additional to ICS
May have an additive benefit when used with an ICS, but benefit less favorable compared to adding a LABA
...but in the "real-world", LTRA may be equally effective since generally many like oral meds better than inhaled meds ( $\uparrow$ adherence)

\section*{REMEMBER TO...}
- Provide guided self-management education
- Treat modifiable risk factors and comorbidities
- Advise about non-pharmacological therapies and strategies
- Consider stepping up if ... uncontrolled symptoms, exacerbations or risks, but check diagnosis, inhaler technique and adherence first
- Consider stepping down if ... symptoms controlled for 3 months + low risk for exacerbations. Ceasing ICS is not advised.

\section*{STEP 1 - AS-NEEDED INHALED SHORT-ACTING $\mathrm{BETA}_{2}$-AGONIST (SABA)}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_14_202924806913c28d4c29g-072.jpg?height=1136&width=2396&top_left_y=382&top_left_x=33)

+ Tiotropium by mist inhaler is an add-on treatment for patients $\geq 12$ years with a history of exacerbations

\section*{STEP 1 - AS-NEEDED RELIEYER INHALER}

Preferred option: as-needed inhaled short-acting beta ${ }_{2}$-agonist (SABA)

SABAs are highly effective for relief of asthma symptoms
However .... there is insufficient evidence about the safety of treating asthma with SABA alone This option should be reserved for patients with infrequent symptoms (less than twice a month) of short duration, and with no risk factors for exacerbations
Other options
Consider adding regular low dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for patients at risk of exacerbations

\section*{STEP 2 - LOW-ROSE CONTROLLER + AS-NEEDED INHALED SABA}

\section*{STEP 2 - LOW DOSE CONTROLLER + AS-}

\section*{NEEDED SABA}

Preferred option: regular low dose ICS with as-needed inhaled SABA

Low dose ICS reduces symptoms and reduces risk of exacerbations and asthma-related hospitalization and death Other options

Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) with as-needed SABA
Less effective than low dose ICS
May be used for some patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis, or if patient will not use ICS
Combination low dose ICS/long-acting beta ${ }_{2}$-agonist (LABA) with as-needed SABA

Reduces symptoms and increases lung function compared with ICS
More expensive, and does not further reduce exacerbations
Intermittent ICS with as-needed SABA for purely seasonal allergic asthma with no interval symptoms

Start ICS immediately symptoms commence, and continue for 4 weeks after pollen season ends

STEP 3 - ONE OR TWO CONTROLLERS + AS-NEEDED INHALED RELIEVER
}

\section*{Before considering step-up}

Check inhaler technique and adherence, confirm diagnosis
Adults/adolescents: preferred options are either combination low dose ICS/LABA maintenance with as-needed SABA, OR combination low dose ICS/formoterol maintenance and reliever regimen*

Adding LABA reduces symptoms and exacerbations and increases $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$, while allowing lower dose of ICS
In at-risk patients, maintenance and reliever regimen significantly reduces exacerbations with similar level of symptom control and lower ICS doses compared with other regimens
Children 6-11 years: preferred option is medium dose ICS with as-needed SABA
Other options
Adults/adolescents: Increase ICS dose or add LTRA or theophylline (less effective than ICS/LABA)
Children 6-11 years - add LABA (similar effect as increasing ICS)

\section*{STEP 5 - HIGHER LEVEL CARE AND/OR}

\section*{ADD-ON TREATMENT}

Preferred option is referral for specialist investigation and consideration of add-on treatment

If symptoms uncontrolled or exacerbations persist despite Step 4 treatment, check inhaler technique and adherence before referring
Add-on tiotropium for patients $\geq 12$ years with history of exacerbations
Add-on omalizumab (anti-IgE) for patients with severe allergic asthma
Add-on mepolizumab (anti-IL5) for severe eosinophilic asthma ( $\geq 12 \mathrm{yrs}$ )
Other add-on treatment options at Step 5 include:
Sputum-guided treatment: this is available in specialized centers; reduces exacerbations and/or corticosteroid dose Add-on low dose oral corticosteroids ( $\leq 7.5 \mathrm{mg} /$ day prednisone equivalent): this may benefit some patients, but has significant systemic side-effects. Assess and monitor for osteoporosis See ERS/ATS Severe Asthma Guidelines (Chung et al, ERJ 2014) for more detail
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multirow[t]{2}{*}{Inhaled corticosteroid} & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Total daily dose (mcg)} \\

\section*{REVIEWING RESPONSE AND ADJUSTING}

\section*{TREATMENT}

How often should asthma be reviewed?
1-3 months after treatment started, then every 3-12 montr During pregnancy, every 4-6 weeks
After an exacerbation, within 1 week
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_14_202924806913c28d4c29g-084.jpg?height=406&width=412&top_left_y=352&top_left_x=2071)

Stepping up asthma treatment
Sustained step-up, for at least 2-3 months if asthma poorly controlled Important: first check for common causes (symptoms not due to asthma, incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence)
Short-term step-up, for 1-2 weeks, e.g. with viral infection or allergen May be initiated by patient with written asthma action plan
Day-to-day adjustment
For patients prescribed low-dose ICS/formoterol maintenance and reliever regimen*
Stepping down asthma treatment
Consider step-down after good control maintained for 3 months Find each patient's minimum effective dose, that controls both symptoms and exacerbations

\section*{GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR STEPPING ROWN CONTROLLER TREATMENT}

To find the lowest dose that controls symptoms and exacerbations, and minimizes the risk of side-effects
When to consider stepping down
When symptoms have been well controlled and lung function stable for $\geq 3$ months
No respiratory infection, patient not travelling, not pregnant
Prepare for step-down
Record the level of symptom control and consider risk factors
Make sure the patient has a written asthma action plan
Book a follow-up visit in 1-3 months
Step down through available formulations
Stepping down ICS doses by 25-50\% at 3 month intervals is feasible and safe for most patients (Hagan et al, Allergy 2014)
See GINA 2016 report Box 3-7 for specific step-down options
Stopping ICS is not recommended in adults with asthma because of risk of exacerbations (Rank et al, JACI 2013)

\section*{TREATING MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS}

Provide skills and support for guided asthma self-management
This comprises self-monitoring of symptoms and/or PEF, a written asthma action plan and regular medical review
Prescribe medications or regimen that minimize exacerbations
ICS-containing controller medications reduce risk of exacerbations
For patients with $\geq 1$ exacerbations in previous year, consider low-dose ICS/formoterol maintenance and reliever regimen*
Encourage avoidance of tobacco smoke (active or ETS)
Provide smoking cessation advice and resources at every visit
For patients with severe asthma
Refer to a specialist center, if available, for consideration of add-on medications and/or sputum-guided treatment
For patients with confirmed food allergy:
Appropriate food avoidance
Ensure availability of injectable epinephrine for anaphylaxis

\section*{NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS}

Avoidance of tobacco smoke exposure
Provide advice and resources at every visit; advise against exposure of children to environmental tobacco smoke (house, car)
Physical activity
Encouraged because of its general health benefits. Provide advice about exercise-induced bronchoconstriction
Occupational asthma
Ask patients with adult-onset asthma about work history. Remove sensitizers as soon as possible. Refer for expert advice, if available
Avoid medications that may worsen asthma
Always ask about asthma before prescribing NSAIDs or beta-blockers
Remediation of dampness or mold in homes
Reduces asthma symptoms and medication use in adults
(Allergen avoidance)
(Not recommended as a general strategy for asthma)
See GINA Box 3-9 and online Appendix for details

Persistent or symptoms $\rightarrow$ ICS daily $+\beta 2$ PRN
Initiate treatment
See patient 2 weeks after initial visit
Assess adherence, inhaler/spacer technique
Assess adverse effects
Assess level of control
Poor control - see more frequently ( $2-4 \mathrm{wks}$ )
Good control - see less frequently (3mths)

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF EXACERBATION}

> Clinical findings(ABC), supplemented by objective tests, should be used to assess the severity of an acute asthma exacerbation.

> Clinical evaluation should be repeated frequently during the management of an acute asthma exacerbation to assess response to therapy.

\section*{ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY}

History
time of onset of exacerbation
current medications and allergies
recent use of beta 2-agonists
Risk factors for severe, uncontrolled disease
Exam
vital signs
pulse oximetry
level of consciousness, anxiety, and agitation breathlessness, wheezing, air entry, accessory muscle use, and retractions

\section*{PULMONARY INDEX}
asthma score based on five clinical variables

RR,degree of wheezing, I/E ratio, accessory muscle use, and oxygen saturation score of 7-11 indicates mod severity and a score of $\geq 12$ indicates a severe attack. can be used to assess initial severity and to judge response to treatment.

\section*{PULMONARY INDEX SCORE}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Score & RR & Wheeze & Insp/Exp Ratio & Accessor y Muscle & SP02 \\
\hline 0 & <30 & None & 2:1 & None & 99-100 \\

epinephrine and terbutaline - s.c. or i.v. Subcutaneous. S.c. beta 2-agonists may be superior to inhaled beta 2-agonists for severe exacerbations poor inspiratory flow Anxious children who are uncooperative with or have suboptimal response to initial aerosolized therapy.
terbutaline produces fewer adverse effects than epinephrine.
S.c. terbutaline $-0.01 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per dose ( 1 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}$ solution) with a max dose of 0.4 mg ( 0.4 mL)
- may be repeated every 20 min for three doses.
S.c. epinephrine $-0.01 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ of $1: 1000$ solution [ $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}$ ]), with a max dose of 0.4 mL ( 0.4 mg ) - may be repeated every 20 min for 3 doses, then every 2-6 hrs as needed.
-dosing interval may be decreased for children who continue with severe respi distress.

\section*{NONSTANDARD THERAPIES}

Little data to support the routine use of heliox, ketamine, or leukotriene receptor antagonists in the treatment of children with acute asthma.
Heliox- mixture of helium and oxygen may enhance beta 2-agonist delivery because the lower gas density would result in decreased flow resistance.
- Ketamine - bronchodilating properties,
- Drug of choice for sedation and analgesia before intubating a child with asthma.
- Limited data
3. Leukotriene receptor antagonists
- Studies largely confined to adults

\section*{MILD EXACERBATION}

Salbutamol inhalation therapy administered via small volume nebulizer at $0.15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ (max 5 mg ) or

MDI at a dose of one-quarter to one-third puff/kg (maximum 10 puffs)

If repeated doses are needed, they should be given every 20-30mins for 3 doses

Administration of systemic glucocorticoids to those who fail to improve after one inhalation therapy

\section*{MODERATE EXACERBATION}

Supplemental oxygen if oxygen saturation $\leq 92 \%$ in room air

Salbutamol nebulization combined with ipratropium ( $250 \mu \mathrm{~g} /$ dose if $<20 \mathrm{~kg} ; 500 \mu \mathrm{~g} /$ dose if $>20 \mathrm{~kg}$ ) every 20 - 30 mins for 3 doses or continuously

Patients who have received 3 doses of intermittent therapy \& require additional Salbutamol may be treated intermittently every 30 - 45 mins or switched to continuous therapy

\section*{Criteria for admission:}

Children who require beta 2 -agonist therapy more often than every $2-3 \mathrm{hrs}$

Have not improved after administration of systemic glucocorticoids

Who require supplemental oxygen

\section*{Other factors:}
1. A history of rapid progression of severity in past exacerbations
2. Poor adherence with outpatient medication regimen
3. Inadequate access to medical care
4. Poor social support system at home

\section*{CONT,}

Inpatient treatment is typically a continuation of therapies and monitoring that have been started in the outpatient.

\section*{ICU ADMISSION: RISK FACTORS}

\section*{ICU admissions, mechanical ventilation, or rapidly progressive and sudden respiratory deterioration}

Seizures or syncope during an asthma exacerbation

Exacerbations precipitated by food

\section*{ICU ADMISSION: RISK FACTORS}

Use of more than two beta-agonist metered dose inhaler (MDI) canisters per month
Insufficient controller therapy or poor adherence to controller therapy
Denial of or failure to perceive the severity of illness
Associated depression or other psychiatric disorder

\section*{PRINCIPLES}

Children who fail to improve with initial treatment in the emergency department should be admitted to the ICU.

Management entails the use of corticosteroids, aggressive bronchodilator therapy and close monitoring.

Mechanical ventilation- reserved for patients with continued progression toward respiratory failure despite maximal medical therapy.

\section*{CONT,}

The decision to intubate a patient should not be delayed until respiratory failure is imminent.

Patients are progressing toward respiratory muscle fatigue NPPV may avoid the need for intubation by easing the work of breathing while awaiting the maximal therapeutic effects of pharmacotherapy.

\section*{STATUS ASTMATICUS}

\section*{Definition}

Status asthmaticus is a prolonged severe attack of asthma that is unresponsive to initial standard therapy, is characterized especially by dyspnea, dry cough, wheezing, and hypoxemia, and that may lead to respiratory failure. The attack can last up to 24 hours. It is the extreme form of an asthma exacerbation that can result in hypoxemia, hypercarbia, (abnormally elevated carbon dioxide saturation in the blood) and secondary respiratory failure. Status asthmaticus is considered a medical emergency. It does not respond to standard treatments of bronchodilators (inhalers) and this should be prevented from happening through patient compliance with controller medications (e.g. steroid inhalers) in an outpatient setting.

Status asthmaticus can vary from a mild form to a severe form with bronchospasm, airway inflammation, and mucus plugging that can cause difficulty breathing, carbon dioxide retention, hypoxemia, and respiratory failure.

\section*{Signs and symptoms}

An exacerbation (attack) of asthma is experienced as a worsening of asthma symptoms with breathlessness and cough (often worse at night).

In acute severe asthma, breathlessness may be so severe that it is impossible to speak more than a few words.
- On examination, the respiratory rate may be elevated (more than 25 breaths per minute)
- Heart rate may be rapid (110 beats per minute or faster).
- Reduced oxygen saturation levels
- Auscultation of the lungs with a stethoscope may reveal reduced air entry and/or widespread wheeze. ${ }^{[2]}$
- The peak expiratory flow can be measured at the bedside; in acute severe asthma the flow is less than $50 \%$ a person's normal or predicted flow.
- Very severe acute asthma (termed "near-fatal" as there is an immediate risk to life) is characterized by a peak flow of less than $33 \%$ predicted, oxygen saturations below $92 \%$ or cyanosis (blue discoloration, usually of the lips), absence of audible breath sounds over the chest ("silent chest"), reduced respiratory effort and visible exhaustion or drowsiness. Irregularities in the heart beat and abnormal lowering of the blood pressure may be observed. ${ }^{[2]}$

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Inflammation in asthma is characterized by an influx of eosinophil's during the early-phase reaction and a mixed cellular infiltrate composed of eosinophils, mast cells, lymphocytes, and neutrophils during the late-phase reaction. The simple explanation for allergic inflammation in asthma begins with the development of a predominantly helper T2 lymphocyte-driven, as opposed to helper T1 lymphocyte-driven, immune milieu, perhaps caused by certain types of immune stimulation early in life. This is followed by allergen exposure in a genetically susceptible individual.

Specific allergen exposure (e.g., dust mites) under the influence of helper $\underline{T}_{\mathrm{h}} \underline{2}$ helper T cells leads to B-lymphocyte elaboration of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies specific to that allergen. The IgE antibody attaches to surface receptors on airway mucosal mast cells. One important question is whether atopic individuals with asthma, in contrast to atopic persons without asthma, have a defect in mucosal integrity that makes them susceptible to penetration of allergens into the mucosa.

Subsequent specific allergen exposure leads to cross-bridging of IgE molecules and activation of mast cells, with elaboration and release of a vast array of mediators. These mediators include histamine; leukotriene's C4, D4, and E4; and a host of cytokines. Together, these mediators cause bronchial smooth muscle constriction, vascular leakage, inflammatory cell recruitment (with further mediator release), and mucous gland secretion. These processes lead to airway obstruction by constriction of the smooth muscles, edema of the airways, influx of inflammatory cells, and formation of intraluminal mucus. In addition, ongoing airway inflammation is thought to cause the airway hyperactivity characteristic of asthma. The more severe the airway obstruction, the more likely ventilation-perfusion mismatching will result in impaired gas exchange and low levels of oxygen in the blood.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
- History and physical examination.
- Pulmonary function studies Pulmonary function tests are a broad range of tests that measure how well the lungs take in and exhale air and how efficiently they transfer oxygen into the blood.
$\checkmark$ Spirometry measures how well the lungs exhale.
$\checkmark$ Lung volume measurement detects restrictive lung diseases. In this set of diseases, a person cannot inhale a normal volume of air. Testing the diffusion capacity (also called the DLCO) permits an estimate of how efficiently the lungs transfer oxygen from the air into the bloodstream.
- Peak expiratory flow rate. Decreased.
- Functional Residual Capacity (FRC), Total Lung Capacity (TLC), and Residual Volume (RV) are increased because air is trapped within the lungs.
- Chest X-ray.
- Pulse oximetry and ABG. Pulse oximetry usually reveals low oxygen saturation. ABG results often show some degree of hypoxemia, with elevated partial pressure of arterial carbon-dioxide in severe cases.
- Allergy skin testing if indicated.
- Blood level of eosinophils amd IgE.

\section*{Treatment}

After confirming the diagnosis and assessing the severity of an asthma attack, direct treatment toward controlling bronchoconstriction and inflammation.
Interventions include intravenous (IV) medications (e.g. magnesium sulfate), aerosolized medications to dilate the airways (Broncho dilation) (e.g., albuterol or ipratropium bromide/salbutamol), and positive-pressure therapy, including mechanical ventilation. Multiple
therapies may be used simultaneously to rapidly reverse the effects of status asthmaticus and reduce permanent damage of the airways. Intravenous corticosteroids ${ }^{[3]}$ and methylxanthines are often given. If the person with a severe asthma exacerbation is on a mechanical ventilator, certain sedating medications such as ketamine or propofol, have Broncho dilating properties.

\section*{Fluid replacement}

Hydration, with intravenous normal saline at a reasonable rate, is essential. Special attention to the patient's electrolyte status is important.
Hypokalemia may result from either corticosteroid use or beta-agonist use. Correcting hypokalemia may help to wean an intubated patient with asthma from mechanical ventilation. Hypophosphatemia may result from poor oral intake and is also an important consideration when weaning such patients.

\section*{Antibiotics}

Patients are administered antibiotics only when they show evidence of infection (eg, pneumonia, sinusitis). In some situations, sinus imaging using computed tomography (CT) scanning or plain radiography may be essential to rule out chronic sinusitis.

\section*{Oxygen monitoring and therapy}

Monitoring the patient's oxygen saturation is essential during the initial treatment of status asthmaticus. Arterial blood gas (ABG) values are usually used to assess hypercapnia (carbon dioxide toxicity) during the patient's initial assessment. Oxygen saturation is then monitored via pulse oximetry throughout the treatment protocol.
Oxygen therapy is essential, with hypoxia being the leading cause of death in children with asthma. Oxygen therapy can be administered via a nasal canula or mask, although patients with dyspnea often do not like masks. With the advent of pulse oximetry, oxygen therapy can be easily titrated to maintain the patient's oxygen saturation above $92 \%$ ( $>95 \%$ in pregnant patients or those with cardiac disease).
In the event of significant hypoxemia, non-rebreathing masks may be used to deliver as much as $98 \%$ oxygen. Tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are indicated for respiratory failure.

\section*{Leukotriene modifiers}

Leukotriene modifiers are useful for treating chronic asthma but not acute asthma. This treatment may be beneficial if used via a nebulizer, but it remains experimental. Most studies have examined intravenous use, such as that by Dockhorn et al. ${ }^{[16]}$

\section*{ICU admission criteria}

Indications for ICU admission include the following:
- Altered sensorium
- Use of continuous inhaled beta-agonist therapy
- Exhaustion
- Markedly decreased air entry
- Rising $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ despite treatment
- Presence of high-risk factors for a severe attack
- Failure to improve despite adequate therapy

\section*{Surgery}

Status asthmaticus is generally managed by means of medical therapy, with some exceptions. For example, thoracostomy is indicated in pneumothoraces.
Some children may have asthma that is primarily exacerbated by gastroesophageal reflux disease. Some patients can be treated with a combination of antireflux (eg, proton pump inhibitors) and histamine 2 (H2)-receptor antagonist agents. However, surgery, such as Nissen fundoplication (surgical procedure to treat GERG) is occasionally required.
-

\section*{Diet}

Some children with asthma may have episodes triggered by food allergies. Consultation with a nutritionist may be necessary to provide appropriate dietary management.

\section*{Nursing Management}

The main focus of nursing management is to actively assess the airway and the patient's response to treatment. The nurse should be prepared for the next intervention if the patient does not respond to treatment.
- Constantly monitor the patient for the first 12 to 24 hours, or until status asthmaticus is under control. Blood pressure and cardiac rhythm should be monitored continuously during the acute phase and until the patient stabilizes and responds to therapy.
- Assess the patient's skin turgor for signs of dehydration; fluid intake is essential to combat dehydration, to loosen secretions, and to facilitate expectoration.
- Administer IV fluids as prescribed, up to 3 to $4 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, unless contraindicated.
- Encourage the patient to conserve energy.
- Ensure patient's room is quiet and free of respiratory irritants (eg, flowers, tobacco smoke, perfumes, or odors of cleaning agents); no allergenic pillows should be used.
