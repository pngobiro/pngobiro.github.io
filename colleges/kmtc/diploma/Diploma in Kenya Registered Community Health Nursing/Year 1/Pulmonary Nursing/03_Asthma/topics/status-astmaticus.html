                        <p>Status asthmaticus is a prolonged severe attack of asthma that is unresponsive to initial standard therapy, is characterized especially by dyspnea, dry cough, wheezing, and hypoxemia, and that may lead to respiratory failure. The attack can last up to 24 hours. It is the extreme form of an asthma exacerbation that can result in hypoxemia, hypercarbia, (abnormally elevated carbon dioxide saturation in the blood) and secondary respiratory failure. Status asthmaticus is considered a medical emergency. It does not respond to standard treatments of bronchodilators (inhalers) and this should be prevented from happening through patient compliance with controller medications (e.g. steroid inhalers) in an outpatient setting.</p>
                        <p>Status asthmaticus can vary from a mild form to a severe form with bronchospasm, airway inflammation, and mucus plugging that can cause difficulty breathing, carbon dioxide retention, hypoxemia, and respiratory failure.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Inflammation in asthma is characterized by an influx of eosinophils during the early-phase reaction and a mixed cellular infiltrate composed of eosinophils, mast cells, lymphocytes, and neutrophils during the late-phase reaction. The simple explanation for allergic inflammation in asthma begins with the development of a predominantly helper T2 lymphocyte-driven, as opposed to helper T1 lymphocyte-driven, immune milieu, perhaps caused by certain types of immune stimulation early in life. This is followed by allergen exposure in a genetically susceptible individual.</p>
                        <p>Specific allergen exposure (e.g., dust mites) under the influence of helper T<sub>h</sub>2 helper T cells leads to B-lymphocyte elaboration of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies specific to that allergen. The IgE antibody attaches to surface receptors on airway mucosal mast cells. One important question is whether atopic individuals with asthma, in contrast to atopic persons without asthma, have a defect in mucosal integrity that makes them susceptible to penetration of allergens into the mucosa.</p>
                        <p>Subsequent specific allergen exposure leads to cross-bridging of IgE molecules and activation of mast cells, with elaboration and release of a vast array of mediators. These mediators include histamine; leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4; and a host of cytokines. Together, these mediators cause bronchial smooth muscle constriction, vascular leakage, inflammatory cell recruitment (with further mediator release), and mucous gland secretion. These processes lead to airway obstruction by constriction of the smooth muscles, edema of the airways, influx of inflammatory cells, and formation of intraluminal mucus. In addition, ongoing airway inflammation is thought to cause the airway hyperactivity characteristic of asthma. The more severe the airway obstruction, the more likely ventilation-perfusion mismatching will result in impaired gas exchange and low levels of oxygen in the blood.</p>

Multiple therapies may be used simultaneously to rapidly reverse the effects of status asthmaticus and reduce permanent damage of the airways. Intravenous corticosteroids<sup>[3]</sup> and methylxanthines are often given.

                        <p>The main focus of nursing management is to actively assess the airway and the patient's response to treatment. The nurse should be prepared for the next intervention if the patient does not respond to treatment.</p>

                            <li>Constantly monitor the patient for the first 12 to 24 hours, or until status asthmaticus is under control. Blood pressure and cardiac rhythm should be monitored continuously during the acute phase and until the patient stabilizes and responds to therapy.</li>
                            <li>Assess the patient's skin turgor for signs of dehydration; fluid intake is essential to combat dehydration, to loosen secretions, and to facilitate expectoration.</li>
                            <li>Administer IV fluids as prescribed, up to 3 to 4 L/day, unless contraindicated.</li>
                            <li>Encourage the patient to conserve energy.</li>
                            <li>Ensure patient's room is quiet and free of respiratory irritants (eg, flowers, tobacco smoke, perfumes, or odors of cleaning agents); no allergenic pillows should be used.</li>
