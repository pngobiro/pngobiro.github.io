                        <p>Occupational exposures produce a wide range of interstitial lung disorders. Occupational etiologies account for a significant portion of all interstitial lung disease (ILD), and new causes continue to be described. All of these disorders are preventable with the reduction or elimination of workplace exposure. This chapter highlights the common, persistent diseases that continue to plague workers globally, as well as recent developments in ILD caused by exposure to metal dust and fumes, inorganic fibers, and nonfibrous inorganic dust.</p>
                        <p>ILDs caused by exposure to agents encountered in the workplace (occupational ILD) are an important and preventable group of illnesses. A large number of different agents cause occupational ILD, some well described and others poorly characterised. The list of causative agents continues to expand. The clinical, radiological, and pathological presentations of occupational ILD are very similar to nonoccupational variants because of the lung's limited patterns of response to injury [1]. The clinician must therefore maintain a high degree of suspicion and perform a thorough occupational history when confronted with a new patient presenting with ILD. The recognition of occupational ILD is especially important because of the implications with regard to primary and secondary disease prevention in exposed coworkers. This chapter will review occupational interstitial lung diseases caused by exposure to metals, inorganic fibrous dust, and inorganic nonfibrous dusts and chemicals. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by organic dust exposure is discussed elsewhere in this volume.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The epidemiology of occupational ILD remains poorly understood. Limitations to the epidemiologic data include nonstandardised diagnostic criteria, varied physician awareness, limitations inherent to the various data sources (death certificates, hospital discharge data, surveillance or reporting systems, etc.), and the long latency period of many agents. Occupational exposures can both cause ILD directly and also influence the risk of developing idiopathic forms of pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) [2]. A number of authors have investigated patients with IPF and the association of previous exposure to a variety of occupational agents [3-9]. All exposures have methodological limitations; however, metal dust exposure consistently emerges as a risk factor for IPF development. Wood dust exposure has also been shown to be a significant risk factor in some studies.</p>
                        <p>Other authors investigated what proportion of ILD is occupational, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In a population-based study, Coultas et al. [4] found $14\%$ of prevalent and $12\%$ of incident cases of ILD were occupational in origin. In data from European Registries, occupational ILD accounts for $4-18\%$ of prevalent and $13-19\%$ of incident cases of ILD [9]. Thus, it is important for the clinician caring for these patients to understand the approach to the diagnosis and treatment of occupational ILD and to appreciate the spectrum of causative agents.</p>
                        <p>The importance of obtaining a comprehensive occupational history from the patient cannot be overemphasized [10,11]. In one pathological series, occupational ILD was missed in $25\%$ of the biopsies referred for "IPF" and only discovered after detailed mineralogical analysis indicated the diagnosis and further history was obtained [12]. In addition to occupational history, consideration should be given to bystander exposures, both in the home and the workplace, as illustrated by the occurrence of chronic beryllium disease in housewives and development of asbestosis in areas of significant environmental contamination as was seen in Libby, Montana, near a vermiculite mine that was laden with tremolite asbestos [13,14].</p>
                        <p>Exposure factors vary by the type of agent. Some exposures trigger an immune response, acting as antigens or haptens and lead to immune sensitization. Once sensitized, individuals are susceptible for progression to immune-mediated inflammation and subsequent fibrosis. Beryllium is the best understood example of this group of agents and is discussed in more detail in the section "Chronic Beryllium Disease." Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is discussed elsewhere in this volume. For other exposures (e.g., asbestos, coal, and silica) the cumulative exposure dose is the most important disease determinant [15]. The size, solubility, durability, and oxidative properties of inhaled agent are also important [16]. For fibers, pathogenic potential is also related to the fiber dimensions (length:diameter) as longer thinner fibers are more fibrogenic [17].</p>
                        <p>In addition to exposure, host-related factors affect pathogenesis and should be considered, including anatomic and physiologic characteristics that influence the deposition and clearance of inhaled particles (e.g., efficiency of nasal filtering and the mucociliary blanket, overall length of the respiratory tree, respiratory pattern, etc.) and genetic factors [15].</p>

                                <p>Asbestosis is the best-characterized occupational ILD caused by inorganic fibers. Asbestosis is defined as interstitial fibrosis caused by asbestos fibers [18]. There are several different types of asbestos fibers, including both serpentine (chrysotile) and amphibole (e.g., crocidolite, amosite, tremolite). In addition to interstitial fibrosis, asbestos exposure causes a variety of pleural diseases, including benign pleural effusions, pleural and diaphragmatic plaques, and diffuse pleural thickening. All fiber types have the potential to cause asbestosis, given sufficient exposure [18]. The latency between exposure onset and disease is long, ranging from 15 to greater than 40 years.</p>
                                <p>The primary symptom of asbestosis is dyspnea on exertion. Patients may also note a dry cough. Physical examination reveals bibasilar dry crackles. Clubbing also occurs. Cor pulmonale may complicate advanced disease. Pulmonary function abnormalities include reduced lung volumes and/or a reduced diffusion capacity (of the lung) for carbon monoxide (DL${}_{\text{CO}}$). Large airway function as shown by the forced expiratory volume in 1 second/ forced vital capacity ratio is usually preserved, but the obstruction of small airways is an early finding [18,19].</p>
                                <p>The radiographic features of asbestosis are well-described. The chest radiograph typically reveals bilateral basilar predominant irregular or reticular opacities. Honeycomb change occurs in advanced cases. The high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is more sensitive than plain film for the detection of asbestosis [18,20]. HRCT findings include thickened interlobular septal lines and intralobular core structures (with the later being the initial or earliest CT abnormality), curvilinear lines that persist in the prone position, subpleural ground glass, and honeycombing (Fig. 10.1) [21]. These changes correlate with pathologic findings [22]. Parenchymal fibrous bands are also found but correlate better with diffuse pleural thickening [23]. The CT changes are located primarily in the basilar and subpleural regions [24]. The presence of concomitant pleural disease is an important clue. Pleural disease is rare in IPF, but more than $90\%$ of patients with asbestosis show some pleural abnormality (either plaques, diffuse thickening, or both) on HRCT scans [24].</p>

                                <p>However, the percentage of patients with concomitant pleural disease visible on chest x-ray is significantly lower [18,25].</p>
                                <p>Asbestosis is diagnosed according to the principles discussed previously in this chapter. When biopsies are performed, the presence of asbestos bodies (Fig. 10.2) or fiber counts can assist the clinician in a diagnosis. There are published standards for interpretation but there is significant variability between laboratories [18]. The pathologic lesion of asbestosis begins with a peribronchiolar fibrosis that then extends into surrounding alveolar walls. As the disease progresses, the pathology is similar to that encountered in usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), and the severity can be graded according to published schemata [26].</p>
                                <p>Unfortunately, the disease is progressive in a significant proportion of patients ($20-40\%$). Progression is typically slower than it is for idiopathic forms of pulmonary fibrosis. Risk factors for progression include cumulative exposure, severity of disease at diagnosis and, possibly, fiber type [26,27]. Therapy focuses on removal from exposure and supportive care, including Pneumovax (Merck and Co.., Whitehouse Station, NJ) and influenza vaccinations, prompt treatment of respiratory infections, supplemental oxygen to treat resting or exercise-induced hypoxemia, and diuretics for cor pulmonale. There is no known pharmacologic treatment for asbestosis. No studies have demonstrated efficacy for corticosteroids or immunosuppressant medications.</p>

                                <p>Exposure to other types of fibers can, in some instances, cause occupational ILD. Nylon flock workers' lung was first described in 1998 [28]. It is an ILD that occurs in workers exposed to random cut nylon flock, which is a material that imparts a velvety surface when applied to adhesive fabrics or objects [29]. More recently, this condition has been described in a greeting card manufacturing facility in which the cards were coated with rayon flock in a process that included creating of peak airborne levels of exposure when compressed air was used to blow away excess [30].</p>
                                <p>With a variable latency period that ranges from 1 to 30 years, patients develop symptoms that include persistent dry cough and dyspnea. Physical examination may discover bilateral crackles. The chest radiograph shows reticulonodular infiltrates and the main CT findings from nylon flock exposure include patchy ground glass and micronodules [31]. Reticular abnormalities, consolidation, and traction bronchiectasis also occur in a minority of patients. Lung biopsies demonstrate a lymphocytic bronchiolitis and peribronchiolitis with associated lymphoid aggregates [32]. The only known effective treatment is removal from exposure.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The best-characterized occupational ILD secondary to nonfibrous inorganic dust exposure is silicosis. Silicosis occurs after extensive exposure to crystalline silica (quartz, cristobalite, tridymite, etc.) [33]. Silica-related ILD presents in three ways. The most common, chronic simple silicosis, occurs after a latency period of at least 10 and as long as 40 years. The second presentation, accelerated silicosis, occurs with greater exposures. The clinical phenotype of accelerated silicosis is similar to chronic simple silicosis but the latency period is only 5 to 10 years, and the disease is usually more severe. Progressive massive fibrosis can complicate both chronic simple and accelerated silicosis (see discussion further in this section). Finally, extremely high exposures over a period of months to 2 years can cause acute silicoproteinosis, a disease that is very similar clinically and pathologically to alveolar proteinosis [34,35].</p>
                        <p>In addition to ILD, silica exposure increases one's risk for developing a variety of pulmonary and nonpulmonary illnesses. Silica exposure markedly increases one's risk of developing active tuberculosis and other mycobacterial disease. The risk increases with exposure and severity of disease on chest x-ray [36]. The incidence of both chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is also increased in workers with silica exposure independent of tobacco abuse and even in the absence of radiographically detectable silicosis [37,38]. In addition, the risk of emphysema is increased in silica-exposed smokers (compared with smokers without silica exposure) and those with progressive massive fibrosis [39]. Silica exposure also increases the risk for developing chronic renal insufficiency and autoimmune diseases, particularly scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, and Wegener's granulomatosis [40]. Finally, the International Agency for Research on Cancer lists silica as a known human carcinogen, and both the American Thoracic Society and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health concur [37,41,42].</p>
                        <p>Patients with chronic simple silicosis are frequently asymptomatic, unless COPD is present. Symptoms develop as the disease progresses and particularly when complicated by progressive massive fibrosis [37]. Symptoms include dyspnea on exertion and productive cough. Both are of gradual onset and progress slowly. Pulmonary function tests typically reveal a mixed pattern of obstruction and restriction with a reduced diffusion capacity. Symptoms often correlate best with the obstructive abnormalities [43,44]. When complicated by severe progressive massive fibrosis, restriction predominates.</p>
                        <p>The typical radiographic finding in silicosis is upper lobe predominant nodular opacities. Hilar adenopathy is also seen and in approximately $10\%$ of cases a characteristic pattern of "eggshell" or peripheral calcification occurs. The nodules of silicosis are typically less than 5 mm in diameter and are well-circumscribed. The nodules may coalesce to form masses, known as progressive massive fibrosis (PMF). The International Labor Organization defines a PMF lesion as a mass greater than 1 cm in diameter, whereas the Silicosis and Silicate Disease committee uses a size parameter of 2 cm [35]. As with asbestosis, CT scans demonstrate greater sensitivity than the chest radiograph [45]. CT scans also show well-circumscribed upper lobe predominant nodules, as illustrated in Fig. 10.3. The nodules are primarily posterior and central in distribution. Subpleural nodules are also common, but centrilobular nodules are unusual [46,47]. PMF lesions usually are posterior and bilateral in appearance. Unilateral lesions are a rare occurrence and appear predominantly on the right side. Rapid changes in the size of masses or the presence of cavitation should prompt a search for alternative diagnoses, particularly mycobacterial disease and lung cancer.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>The diagnosis of silicosis usually does not require a lung biopsy (see previous discussion in this section). When a biopsy is performed, the pathognomonic finding is a round, hyalinized nodule known as a silicotic nodule [26,37]. Silicotic nodules are found in both the lung parenchyma and hilar lymph nodes. Diffuse interstitial fibrosis also occurs in a significant minority of patients [26,48].</p>
                        <p>Several therapies have been tried, including corticosteroids and whole lung lavage, but none are of proven benefit. Therapy thus focuses on removal from exposure and supportive care. In addition, one should screen patients with silicosis for tuberculosis with purified protein derivative skin tests. All patients with a positive test should receive treatment.</p>

                                <p>Also called "black lung disease," this form of occupational ILD remains a major health condition worldwide, despite our longstanding knowledge of the hazards and the ways of controlling exposure. It is caused by the chronic inhalation of coal dust, especially from anthracite and bituminous coal high in carbon content and when workers have had more than 10 years of cumulative exposure, depending upon the concentration of dust. Where quartz and coal are found together in mines, the resultant disease displays qualities of both silicosis and CWP. Typical latency is greater than 20 years.</p>
                                <p>Pathophysiologically, alveolar macrophages engulf coal dust, inducing cytokine and growth factor production, stimulating inflammation, collagen deposition, and the accretion of coal particles, resulting in formation of coal macules along bronchioles and the interstitium. These nodules are commonly associated with development of focal emphysema and varying degrees of fibrosis. Significant distortion of the lung architecture ensues, with associated airflow obstruction and varying degrees of impairment. Like silicosis, CWP is categorized as simple CWP, when the macules are individual, or as "complicated" CWP, when they coalesce or form PMF (Fig. 10.4). These large, black, parenchymal masses usually develop in the posterior of the upper lung fields. The masses may compress vascular supply and airways, or may form cavities [49].</p>

                                <p>CWP is associated with an increased risk for the development of rheumatoid arthritis. Multiple rounded nodules appearing over a relatively short time are called Caplan's syndrome and represent an immunologic response related to rheumatoid arthritis. Histologically, these nodules are similar to rheumatoid nodules, except that they show a more acute inflammatory response in their periphery.</p>
                                <p>Simple CWP is often asymptomatic; however, symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath are common in coal miners because of the bronchitis that they develop from daily coal dust exposure. When patients develop complicated CWP, especially with PMF, progressive dyspnea is commonly reported. Pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular and respiratory failure develops in these more severe cases. Black sputum (melanoptysis) is rare and caused by rupture of PMF lesions into the airways.</p>
                                <p>Diagnosis depends on a history of exposure and the chest x-ray or CT scan appearance of diffuse small rounded opacities, with or without the presence of PMF. Chest CT is more useful for identifying CWP and for distinguishing PMF from other medical conditions, such as malignancy. Although spirometry, lung volumes, and DL${}_{\text{CO}}$ are nondiagnostic, they are important for characterizing lung impairment, as obstructive, restrictive, or mixed defects may develop [50]. Direct measures of gas exchange, such as resting arterial blood gas analysis and oximetry during exercise testing, provide additional important data for treatment and assessment of disability.</p>
                                <p>Treatment is usually unnecessary, unless patients develop complicated CWP, or show evidence of pulmonary hypertension and/or gas exchange abnormalities. Appropriate treatment with supplemental oxygen is advised for hypoxemic CWP patients. Bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and other mainstays of pulmonary pharmacotherapy are generally unhelpful.</p>

                            <div class="content-card">
                                <p>On September 11, 2001, the attack and collapse of the World Trade Center (WTC) in New York City created a massive plume of respirable airborne particulate matter [51]. In addition to high reported rates of bronchitis (so-called "WTC cough") and new-onset asthma [52], interesting data have emerged suggesting a relationship between this complex dust and combustion product mixture and the occurrence of sarcoidosis-like granulomatous pulmonary disease [53,54]. In particular, a recent study by Izbicki et al. [53] contributes evidence that occupational and environmental exposures may cause or trigger granulomatous pneumonitis and possibly some cases that have extrathoracic granulomatous inflammation as well.</p>
                                <p>Firefighting is one of a number of occupations in which environmental exposures have been implicated in sarcoidosis etiology [55-59]. Because firefighters in New York City had been the subject of a previous surveillance study that had examined sarcoidosis point prevalence and incidence in the 15 years leading up to the WTC collapse [59], Izbicki et al. [53] were able to compare rates of this disease in the pre- and post-9/11 periods by continuing a prospective surveillance study. In the 5 years after $9/11$, using similar surveillance methods to the pre-$9/11$ period, the authors found 26 new cases [53]. Thirteen were identified during the first year after WTC dust exposure and 13 more during the next 4 years.</p>
                                <p>Calculated as incidence rates, this translated to an incidence rate of $86/100,000$ in the first year after $9/11$ and $22/100,000$ average annual rate in the next 4 years, as compared with $15/100,000$ during the 15 years before the WTC collapse. All 26 cases had intrathoracic adenopathy with biopsy-proven intrathoracic granulomatous disease, and 6 had evidence of extrathoracic disease. Notably, 16 of 18 had clinical findings consistent with asthma and a high rate of airway hyperreactivity. These data, taken in context with the body of previous literature, suggest that intense exposures to inorganic dust may contribute to sarcoidosis risk.</p>

                            <h3 id="subsection-heading-chronic-beryllium-disease" class="subsection-heading">Chronic Beryllium Disease (CBD)</h3>
                            <div class="content-card">
                                <p>Although many metals can cause lung disease [58], the best-characterized occupational ILD secondary to metal dust and fume exposure is CBD. CBD is a granulomatous disease similar to sarcoidosis that occurs after exposure and subsequent sensitization to beryllium. Like sarcoidosis, the lung is the primary organ involved, but the skin, liver, spleen, myocardium, skeletal muscle, salivary glands, and bones may also be affected. Exposure to pure beryllium metal, beryllium alloys (with copper, nickel, magnesium, or aluminum), or beryllium oxides used in high technology ceramics can all cause CBD. Current data based on workforce screenings indicate that beryllium sensitization or CBD develops in $2-15\%$ of those exposed [60,61]. Beryllium exposure also can cause tracheobronchitis, acute toxic pneumonitis (when inhaled at high levels), and increases the risk of lung cancer.</p>
                                <p>Unlike asbestosis and silicosis, the pathogenesis of chronic beryllium disease involves activation of the adaptive immune response. This has several important implications. First, the latency period is highly variable ranging from 2 months to more than 40 years [62,63]. Second, even seemingly small exposures can be clinically significant, as illustrated by reported cases in security guards, secretaries, and residents living near beryllium production facilities [63,64]. In addition, activation of the adaptive immune response can be detected with the beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT). This test is performed on either blood or bronchoalveolar lavage cells and quantifies the beryllium-specific T-cell response based on cell uptake of radiolabeled DNA precursors by T cells that have been exposed to beryllium salts in vitro [65]. In addition to its use as a clinical diagnostic tool, the BeLPT is used to screen exposed workforces.</p>
                                <p>When detected in workplace-screening programs, patients who present CBD often are asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they may include insidious onset of dyspnea on exertion and dry cough. Constitutional symptoms, including fatigue, weight loss, fever, night sweats, arthralgias, and myalgias also occur. Physical examination reveals bilateral crackles. In advanced cases, cyanosis, digital clubbing and signs of cor pulmonale may appear. Pulmonary function tests may be normal in early disease or show airflow obstruction. As disease progresses, obstructive, restrictive, mixed patterns, and impaired DL${}_{\text{CO}}$ may all occur. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing abnormalities of ventilation or gas exchange are the most sensitive physiologic changes [66].</p>
                                <p>Radiographic changes are similar to sarcoidosis and include diffuse bilateral small opacities that are typically rounded nodules, predominantly in the middle and upper lung fields. Bilateral adenopathy is also seen but less frequently than in sarcoidosis ($15-20\%$), and stage I radiographs (isolated hilar adenopathy) are extremely rare. CT has greater sensitivity than plain film but also may be negative in up to $25\%$ of biopsy-proven CBD cases [58]. CT findings include bilateral small nodules (usually distributed along bronchovascular bundles), septal lines and ground glass attenuation (Fig. 10.5a and 10.5b). Enlarged hilar nodes are detected by CT in approximately one-third of cases. In patients with advanced disease, honeycombing may occur.</p>

                                <p>Published diagnostic algorithms center on the BeLPT because of its high sensitivity and specificity. Diagnosis requires a history of exposure, demonstration of a beryllium-specific immune response in blood or bronchoalveolar lavage, and evidence for lung inflammation (granulomas, mononuclear cell interstitial infiltrates, or a lymphocytic alveolitis) at bronchoscopy. When bronchoscopy with biopsy cannot be safely performed, one can make the diagnosis based on a positive blood BeLPT plus evidence of diffuse lung disease, i.e., typical x-ray or CT abnormalities, abnormal physiology, lavage lymphocytosis [67-69].</p>
                                <p>The natural history of CBD is quite variable [70]. Most patients demonstrate a slow progression of symptoms and functional abnormalities. However, some patients have a more rapid progression, whereas others remain stable for extended periods. Minimization of exposure is recommended for all patients with beryllium sensitivity or CBD. Pharmacologic treatment with corticosteroids is generally initiated in the setting of symptoms with severe or progressive functional abnormalities. There are no randomized trials documenting corticosteroid effectiveness, but its use is supported by multiple published case series. Supportive care (as described above) is also important.</p>

                                <p>It is noteworthy that other metals can produce granulomatous occupational ILD [70]. Although less well studied than beryllium, cases of granulomatous disease have been observed in people exposed to barium, cobalt, copper, gold, lanthanides, aluminum, titanium, and zirconium.</p>
                                <p>Hard metal (also called "cemented carbides") usually comprises $80\%$ tungsten carbide and between $10\%$ and $25\%$ cobalt to create a product that has $90\%$ of the hardness of diamond. This material is used widely in manufacturing hard metaltipped tools, such as saws, cutters, drill bits, grinding wheels, tunneling tools, as well as in defense industry applications such as armor plating and munitions.</p>
                                <p>Although there remains controversy as to whether cobalt alone can produce the clinical picture of hard metal pneumoconiosis or whether cobalt plus tungsten carbide is required, the evidence from published case series, case reports, and five population-based workplace studies provide ample evidence for the etiologic link [71]). The ILD produced by hard metal is characterized by a very wide spectrum of pathology, including desquamative pneumonitis, diffuse fibrosis, perivascular and peribronchial fibrosis, and varying degrees of more acute appearing alveolitis. In some cases, mixed-dust pneumoconiosis with nodular lesions has been reported, as have sarcoidosis-like granulomas and foreign body-type reactions. One significant commonality in most hard metal cases is the appearance of abundant multinucleated giant cells both in pathology specimens and in bronchoalveolar lavage. This has become a common pathologic feature of the disease, such that giant cell interstitial pneumonitis is often considered to be due to hard metal unless proven otherwise. The pathogenesis remains enigmatic but may involve both adaptive immune response to metal antigen as well as an effect of the metal on oxidative stress pathways.</p>
                                <p>Patients with this condition often report recent or ongoing employment in industries in which hard metal dust is generated. Symptoms may include dry cough, dyspnea, and systemic symptoms including weight loss and fever. Onset is often acute or subacute, although chronic insidious onset has also been reported. Clinical examination is nonspecific, including lung crackles and limited chest expansion, with or without wheezing. Cor pulmonale and digital clubbing can occur if the condition has not been detected early. Pulmonary physiology is nonspecific, although most typically it includes restriction, low diffusing capacity, and reduced measures of gas exchange [72]. The chest x-ray findings range from normal films, to wedge-shaped infiltrates, ground glass opacification, and a reticulonodular pattern. CT scans often show septal lines, ground glass, large peripheral cysts, and traction bronchiectasis with a mid- and upper lung zone predominance [73].</p>
                                <p>If bronchoalveolar lavage is performed, large numbers of bizarre-appearing multinucleated giant cells are a strong indication of this condition, especially if viral, bacterial, and fungal cultures are negative. Mineral analysis is advocated by some authors, using biopsy material, BAL, or, more recently, exhaled breath condensate. Such tests have yielded variability results, often showing tungsten, tantalum, and titanium. Cobalt, because of its relatively high solubility, is often absent from the mineral analyses [15].</p>
                                <p>Relatively little is known about the appropriate treatment of this condition. Removal from exposure has resulted in significant improvement and sometimes resolution of disease in some instances. Corticosteroids are commonly used, with variable results.</p>

                        <p>Occupational ILD is a diverse group of preventable pulmonary diseases that account for a significant proportion of all interstitial lung disease. There are numerous welldescribed and some more poorly characterized causative agents. New etiologic exposures continue to be discovered. Diagnosis requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and a thorough occupational and environmental history. Correct diagnosis is important not only for appropriate pharmaceutical treatment, but also because removal from exposure may result in clinical improvement or may slow the progression of many types of occupational ILD. In addition, any individual diagnosis of occupational ILD should prompt the clinician to work with occupational medicine specialists to investigate further. Where there is one worker with occupational lung disease, there often are coworkers with the same condition. Interventions to reduce exposure in the workplace may help reduce risk for large numbers of people.</p>
