                        <p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is one of the most common of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias [1]. It is associated with a variable prognosis that is partially predicted by baseline physiological [2] and radiological features [3,4] as well as longitudinal changes in physiology [2,5-7]. Unfortunately, recent studies have confirmed that a significant proportion of IPF patients die with accelerated disease [8]. In the placebo arm of a large randomized therapeutic trial, $21.4\%$ of patients with IPF died during a 72-week observation period [8]; progression of IPF was thought to be causative in $89\%$, with $47\%$ of these thought by the primary investigator to have occurred within 4 weeks.</p>
                        <p>A subsequent analysis from this dataset confirmed that a decrease of $10\%$ in forced vital capacity (FVC) was the most predictive measurement of survival, although the operating characteristics of this parameter are modest [9]. A subsequent analysis of these results suggests that a decrease in FVC $>10\%$ predicted exhibited a sensitivity of $60\%$, specificity of $75\%$, positive predictive value of $31\%$, and negative predictive value of $91\%$ in predicting mortality [10]. The appreciation that pulmonary hypertension (PH) may impact survival in IPF has been increasingly noted [11-13]. As such, this area is one that is worthy of review.</p>

                        <p>The exact incidence and prevalence of PH remains unclear. Numerous studies have shed light on this topic as enumerated in (Table 9.1). In one of the earlier studies, investigators retrospectively addressed the prevalence of right ventricular function abnormality and tricuspid regurgitation in patients evaluated for lung transplantation [14]. Of the 77 IPF patients, 50 ($65\%$) had right ventricular dysfunction (right ventricular ejection fraction $<45\%$), whereas almost $38\%$ had abnormal tricuspid regurgitation on echocardiography. In a study of 27 patients followed serially in a chest clinic, echocardiography suggested PH (defined as estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure $\geq 40 \text{mmHg}$ or pulmonary acceleration time $\leq 100 \text{ ms}$ or right ventricular hypertrophy/overload) in $36\%$ of cases [15].</p>

                        <p>A separate group retrospectively reviewed 487 patients with IPF who were evaluated from January 1, 1994, to December 31, 1996, and they identified 136 patients who underwent echocardiography at the discretion of the managing physician [12]. After exclusion of left ventricular dysfunction, valvular heart disease, incomplete follow-up or inadequate echocardiographic images for systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) estimation, they determined that 88 patients were available for study. An estimated SPAP $>35 \text{mmHg}$ was noted in $84\%$ of the patients and $>50 \text{mmHg}$ in $16\%$. The combination of emphysema in the upper lung zones and pulmonary fibrosis in the lower lobes on high-resolution computed tomography of the chest has been reported to be associated with a greater prevalence of PH. An estimated SPAP $\geq 45 \text{mmHg}$ was present in $47\%$ at diagnosis and $55\%$ during follow-up in one series [16]. A second group has reported remarkably similar data [17].</p>
                        <p>Echocardiographic data are difficult to interpret because the operating characteristics of echocardiography to estimate SPAP in patients with advanced lung disease have been reported to be quite poor [18]. In a large group of patients with interstitial lung disease evaluated for lung transplantation, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were reported as $85\%$, $17\%$, $60\%$, and $44\%$, respectively [18]. Although echo was able to estimate pressures in $44\%$, $52\%$ of these measures were inaccurate by 10 mmHg or more and $48\%$ of patients were misclassified. In a smaller sample of IPF patients a separate group (prevalence of PH of $39.3\%$) suggested values of $76\%$, $38\%$, $56\%$, and $60\%$ for echocardiography in assessing PH [19]. It is apparent that echocardiographic assessment in IPF patients may be of limited utility.</p>
                        <p>More recent studies have used right heart catheterization (RHC) to accurately measure pulmonary pressures in patients with IPF. One investigative group reported a retrospective analysis of 79 IPF patients undergoing pretransplant RHC; PH (defined as mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure of $\geq 25 \text{mmHg}$) was noted in $31.6\%$ [11]. The data of Hamada et al. [13] are particularly important because they reflect the results of a prospective evaluation of 70 patients undergoing a RCH at first evaluation. Interestingly, PH (resting mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure of $\geq 25 \text{mmHg}$) was detected in only six patients ($8.1\%$).</p>
                        <p>Zisman et al. [19] retrospectively identified 61 of 298 patients evaluated at a single center who had undergone RHC and pulmonary function testing within 1 month of each other. Twenty-four ($39.3\%$) of the patients exhibited a measured, resting PAP $>25 \text{mmHg}$. The nature of the patient population was not clearly defined. Shorr and colleagues [20] examined the United Network for Organ Sharing and the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network registry for IPF patients listed for lung transplantation between January 1995 and June 2004. Of the 3,457 patients listed, 2,525 had RHC results available; of those, 933 ($37.0\%$) had a mean PAP > 25, whereas 231 ($9.1\%$) had a mean PAP $>40 \text{mmHg}$.</p>
                        <p>These data suggest a wide prevalence of PH in patients with IPF. The differing study populations and methodologies used to define PH limits interpretation. In general, it appears that the prevalence of moderate PH in a general population of IPF patients is less than $10\%$. In patients with more severe disease, including those listed for lung transplantation, the prevalence increases to approximately $40\%$. Severe PH is unusual, even in patients listed for lung transplantation.</p>
                        <p>Few longitudinal data to clearly define incidence are available. One group reported in abstract form a baseline prevalence of $41\%$ increasing to $90\%$ at followup [21]. A second group reported a retrospective series of patients who had undergone RHC as part of lung transplant evaluation and a repeat catheterization at the time of lung transplantation; the prevalence of PH increased from $38.6\%$ to $86.4\%$ [22]. Because these case series have not been published in a peer-reviewed setting, it is difficult to assess methodology and, therefore, the clinical implications. Further prospective data collection is required in this arena.</p>

                        <p>The prognostic importance of PH complicating IPF has also been suggested by several groups (Table 9.2). In echocardiographically defined PH, one investigative group has noted that a SPAP $>50 \text{mmHg}$ is associated with impaired survival (Fig. 9.1 A) [12]. A separate group has demonstrated that echocardiographically defined PH in IPF patients with superimposed emphysema negatively influenced survival [16]. In a group of 79 patients undergoing RHC before listing for lung transplantation, the presence of PH predicted mortality with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive, and negative predictive value of $57\%$, $79\%$, $50\%$, and $83.6\%$, respectively [11]. In fact, there was a linear correlation between measured mean PAP and greater mortality (hazard ratio 1.09; $95\%$ confidence interval 1.02-1.16), which persisted after adjustment for FVC and diffusion capacity (of the lung) for carbon monoxide (DL${}_{\text{CO}}$). Figure 9.1B illustrates mortality in patients with and without PH. It is notable that similar results persisted after the data were reanalyzed with those patients who underwent lung transplantation excluded.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>One group has examined the influence of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and physiological features on survival in a large cohort (176 consecutive patients, 55 with IPF) of patients with chronic lung disease [23]. In patients with interstitial lung disease, 31 of 88 had increased levels of BNP; 11 ($35.5\%$) of these died compared with 10 of 57 ($17.5\%$) with normal levels of BNP. Similarly, 28 of 88 interstitial lung disease patients had a mean PAP $>35 \text{mmHg}$, with 12 of these patients ($42.9\%$) dying compared with 9 of 60 ($15\%$) without moderate-to-severe PH. When using ROC analysis in the entire cohort of 176 patients, the authors found that BNP level (area under the curve [AUC] $67.3\%$) and mean PAP (AUC $72.9\%$) predicted mortality better than total lung capacity (AUC $38.5\%$) and PO${}_{2}$ (AUC $29.2\%$).</p>
                        <p>The data of Hamada et al. [13] are the most enlightening as this group prospectively studied a cohort of IPF patients who were evaluated from initial presentation with a RHC. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified a mean PAP threshold of 17 mmHg as most predictive of long-term survival. Figure 9.1C contrasts survival for the patients with a mean PAP $<17 \text{mmHg}$ versus those with a mean PAP $\geq 17 \text{mmHg}$. Additional analyses suggested that grouping patients by mean PAP (< or $\geq 17 \text{mmHg}$ and DL${}_{\text{CO}}\%$ predicted $<40\%$ or $\geq 40\%$ predicted) was particularly predictive of long term survival (Fig. 9.1D). It is evident that complications of PH in patients with IPF are associated with a worse outcome.</p>

                        <p>Given the clinical implications of complications of PH in patients with, it is important to approach diagnosis in a rigorous fashion (Table 9.3). In general, echocardiographically suggested PH has been associated with longer duration of illness, lower PaO${}_{2}$, and lower FVC [15]. Another similar series using echocardiography reported that SPAP correlated inversely with DL${}_{\text{CO}}$, PaO${}_{2}$, and oxygen saturation [12]. No other measure of resting pulmonary function, including spirometry and lung volume, correlated with SPAP.</p>
                        <p>In a series of patients who underwent RHC, the presence of PH correlated with lower DL${}_{\text{CO}}$ ($<40\%$ predicted) and with a requirement for supplemental oxygen (resting SpO${}_{2} <88\%$ or PaO${}_{2} <55 \text{mmHg}$) [11]. The group of patients that met both of these criteria ($15.2\%$ of the cohort) had a 10.2 greater likelihood of having PH. In fact, the combination of both of these criteria identified the presence of PH with a sensitivity of $65.0\%$, specificity of $94.1\%$, positive predictive value of $86.7\%$, and a negative predictive value of $92.1\%$. In a limited number of patients (prevalence of PH $29.4\%$), 6-minute walk testing while breathing room air was available. The distance walked ($143.5 \pm 65.5$ versus $365.9 \pm 81.8$ meters, $p < 0.001$) and the lowest SpO${}_{2}$ during the walk test ($80.1 \pm 3.7\%$ versus $88.0 \pm 3.5\%$, $p < 0.001$) were lower in those patients with PH compared with those without.</p>
                        <p>In a consecutive group of 39 patients with fibrotic lung disease (28 with IPF), the results of a 6-minute walk distance was significantly lower in those with moderate-to-severe PH (mean PAP $>35 \text{mmHg}$) compared with those with no-tomild PH ($185.45 \pm 41.12$ meters versus $303.93 \pm 21.92$ meters, $p < 0.05$); lung function parameters were not different between the groups [24]. These findings were generally confirmed in a subsequent larger study with a broader range of subjects (176 patients, 55 with IPF) [23].</p>
                        <p>In the dataset from the United Network for Organ Sharing and the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network registry, subjects with PH were more likely to have COPD (odds ratio [OR] 1.31; $95\%$ confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.67) and, in multivariate modeling, more likely to require supplemental oxygen (OR 1.22; $95\%$ CI 1.14-1.30), have a greater pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (per $1-\text{mmHg}$ increase above mean cohort value: OR $1.19$; $95\%$ CI $1.16-1.21$), and less likely to have a greater FEV1 (per $1\%$ increase from mean value for cohort: OR 0.99; $95\%$ CI $0.99-1.00$) [20].</p>

                        <p>The most detailed analysis is that of Zisman et al. [19], who examined the predictive value of spirometry and DL${}_{\text{CO}}$ in identifying PH (prevalence of $39\%$). The mean PAP was regressed against SpO${}_{2}$ and $\% \text{FVC}/\% \text{DL}_{\text{CO}}$ with a resulting equation, based on multivariate modeling:</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                        $$\begin{aligned} \mathrm{MPAP}= & -11.9+0.272 \times \mathrm{SpO}_{2}+0.0659 \times\left(100-\mathrm{SpO}_{2}\right) 2+3.06 \\ & \times\left(\% \mathrm{FVC} / \% \mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}\right) \end{aligned}$$
                        </div>
                        <p>There was no correlation between mean PAP and individual spirometric parameters or lung volumes. When echocardiographically estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, six minute walk test distance and $\% \text{DL}_{\text{CO}}/\%$ alveolar volume were added to the model little change occurred. Similarly replacement of SpO${}_{2}$ with PaO${}_{2}$ or $\% \text{FVC}/\% \text{DL}_{\text{CO}}$ with DL${}_{\text{CO}}$ resulted in little change in the overall model. The operating characteristics of the modeling equation included a sensitivity of $71\%$, specificity of $81\%$, positive predictive value of $71\%$, and a negative predictive value of $81\%$.</p>
                        <p>In a subsequent two-center study, the use of the equation exhibited similar operating characteristics [25]. A formula-predicted MPAP $>21 \text{mmHg}$ was associated with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of $95\%$, $58\%$, $51\%$, and $96\%$, respectively. This same group reported that semiquantitative features from computed tomography, including measures of parenchymal abnormality and pulmonary artery size, did not prove predictive of PH in IPF patients [26].</p>
                        <p>BNP may be particularly useful in identifying PH complicating IPF. In the previously mentioned study of 39 consecutive patients with fibrotic lung disease, including 28 with pulmonary fibrosis, plasma BNP level directly correlated with mean PAP [24]. In the IPF patients those with normal BNP levels ($<18 \text{ pg/ml}$, $n=16$) were less likely to exhibit PH compared with those with increased levels of BNP ($>18 \text{ pg/ml}$, $n=12$). Furthermore, plasma BNP levels directly correlated with mean PAP and negatively correlated with cardiac index. Receiver operating characteristic analysis in the entire cohort (including 11 with secondary pulmonary fibrotic disease) suggested that a threshold level of $33.3 \text{ pg/ml}$ exhibited a high sensitivity ($100\%$) and specificity ($89\%$) with an area under the curve of $95.8\%$ ($p < 0.001$) (Fig. 9.2).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A detailed discussion of the pathobiology of PH complicating IPF is beyond the scope of this chapter but a recent review has highlighted the major issues [27]. Overall there are likely multiple, global biological processes underlying the development of PH in IPF, including pulmonary artery vasoconstriction and pulmonary artery remodeling. Supporting the former is the extensive body of literature, which supports a role for hypoxia driven-vasoconstriction in the genesis of secondary PH [28]. This mechanism is particularly well acknowledged in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kyphoscoliosis, and the obesity-hypoventilation syndrome, where intermittent hypoxic episodes have been associated with abnormalities in right heart function [29]. Support for this mechanism in IPF includes the previously noted work suggesting an increased prevalence of PH in IPF patients with lower resting oxygen saturation or PaO${}_{2}$ [12,15] or a requirement for supplemental oxygen therapy [11,20].</p>
                        <p>A mechanistic link to hypoxia has been recently supported by tissue microarray analyses from the bleomycin model of fibrosis in rodents and human IPF tissue [30]. These investigators make a cogent argument for the early role or hypoxia inducible factor 1a in the tissue remodeling of IPF, particularly in its potential association with alveolar cell and myofibroblast aberrant apoptosis. A direct link to abnormal vascular responsiveness was not reported.</p>
                        <p>Pulmonary vascular remodeling has been increasingly accepted as an important pathobiological process in PH [27]. Global, macroscopic vascular remodeling has been clearly reported in IPF, both with areas of vascular ablation and areas of neovascularization [31-33]. One investigative group has demonstrated reduced vascular density in patients with IPF, particularly within fibroblastic foci and in areas of honeycombing [34]. Interestingly, neovascularization near the fibroblastic foci was also demonstrated, suggesting vascular redistribution in this disorder. An examination of lung explants from 26 patients with IPF (19 with PH) confirmed weak positive correlations between the extent of histological fibrosis and PAP [35]. Importantly, occlusive venopathy was noted in $65\%$ of patients, a finding that did not correlate with PAP and was noted in nonfibrotic areas.</p>
                        <p>Additional data suggesting such local vascular remodeling has been supported by preliminary data suggesting that patients with IPF and PH (defined predominantly echo-cardiographically) exhibit down-regulation of certain endothelial cell genes and up-regulation of phospholipase A2 and other factors that may be implicated in local vascular remodeling [36]. It is notable that a large number of mediators have been implicated in IPF pathogenesis that conceivably could potentiate vascular remodeling. Overproduction of profibrogenic eicosanoids has been well demonstrated in lungs of patients with IPF; some of these leukotrienes upregulate numerous potential mediators that have been implicated in pulmonary vascular remodeling [37] Endothelin-1 (ET-1) promotes pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction and induces pulmonary arterial smooth muscle growth [38]. Importantly, IPF lung has been shown to exhibit increased expression of ET-1 [39,40], whereas this expression is inversely correlated with arterial oxygen and directly with PAP [41]. Other important profibrotic cytokines that overlap between IPF and PH include platelet-derived growth factor and tumor growth factor-$\beta$ [27]. Clearly, additional work is required to address the fundamental biological processes underlying fibroproliferation and pulmonary vascular remodeling as they may provide insight into novel therapeutic avenues.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The clear negative implication that PH complications in patients with IPF has on functional status (e.g., 6-minute walk distance) and survival suggests that this is an arena fruitful for therapeutic intervention. Interestingly, very little specific information has been published in this regard. Table 9.4 enumerates the limited available data with a series of therapeutic approaches. Whether agents targeting the remodeling process will have the same success remains unexplored.</p>
                        <p>Given the potential role of hypoxia in the genesis of PH complicating IPF, some have suggested the potential value of oxygen supplementation [27]. The limited available data suggest little benefit with regards to survival with oxygen supplementation in IPF [42]. There are very limited controlled data regarding oxygen therapy in interstitial lung diseases [43]. Importantly, in healthy subjects and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, short-term oxygen exposure has been demonstrated to increase oxidative stress and pulmonary inflammation [44,45]. In patients with IPF, oxidative stress has been suggested to be a key biological process perpetuating disease [46].</p>
                        <p>In contrast, one small study suggested that the combination of oxygen supplementation and low-dose inhaled nitric oxide reduced mean PAP and improved PaO${}_{2}$ in 10 patients with IPF (six with PH) [47]. Interestingly, this latter approach has been used in IPF patients with severe PH as a bridge to transplantation [48]. Additional data are required to better define these therapeutic approaches in IPF patients with PH.</p>
                        <p>Two groups established the groundwork for the use of vasodilators in IPF patients with PH. Olchewski and colleagues [49] studied eight patients with fibrosing lung disease (one with IPF) and PH (estimated peak systolic pulmonary artery pressure of $>50 \text{mmHg}$ or mean PAP $>30 \text{mmHg}$ by RHC). A series of therapeutic interventions were administered in a randomized fashion: inhaled nitric oxide (15-80 ppm; mean 40 ppm ), intravenous epoprostenol (increasing increments of $2 \text{ ng/kg/min}$ until discomfort was reported; mean $8 \text{ ng/kg/min}$), and aerosolized epoprostenol; after each dosing, 1 h was allowed for the subject to return to baseline. After these test periods, nifedipine or diltiazem was administered and hemodynamic measurement completed 30 min later.</p>

                        <p>Inhaled NO decreased mean PAP and slightly increased right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF). Intravenous epoprostenol decreased mean PAP but at the expense of an increased in pulmonary shunt flow and a moderate decrease in SaO${}_{2}$. Aerosolized epoprostenol decreased mean PAP and increased RVEF without much change in pulmonary shunt flow. Similarly, short-term challenge with a calcium channel blocker resulted in increased PAP, RVEF, and cardiac output with little change in shunt flow and arterial oxygenation.</p>
                        <p>Ghofrani and colleagues [50] studied 16 patients with pulmonary fibrosis (7 with IPF) and documented severe PH (mean PAP $>35 \text{mmHg}$). In the protocol, the authors used initial inhalation of nitric oxide ($10-20 \text{ ppm}$) with subsequent randomization to intravenous infusion of epoprostenol with increasing dose in increments of $2 \text{ ng/kg}$ every 15 min or to a single oral dose of sildenafil (50 mg ). The primary endpoint was change in pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI), although a series of important secondary endpoints (including ventilation:perfusion matching) were also measured.</p>

                        <p>Inhalation of nitric oxide led to a rapid decrease in mean pulmonary arterial pressure and an increase in cardiac index resulting in a reduction in PVRI (Fig. 9.3). Little change in ventilation:perfusion matching was noted. Epoprostenol infusion led to an increase in cardiac index and decreased both mean pulmonary arterial pressure and PVRI (Fig. 9.3). Interestingly, major increase in pulmonary shunt flow occurred with resulting decrease in PaO${}_{2}$ (Fig. 9.4). Oral sildenafil led to a vasodilatory response within 15 min , which plateaued after $45-60 \text{ min}$. Mean arterial pressure decreased, as did PVRI; pulmonary shunt flow decreased slightly with an increase in PaO${}_{2}$ (Fig. 9.4). No major adverse events were noted with sildenafil therapy. These two studies suggest that intravenous epoprostenol is unlikely to be tolerated in this patient population but raises hope for other vasodilators.</p>

                        <p>Madden et al. [51] studied the effects of eight weeks of sildenafil (50 mg tid) in four patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and three with IPF, all of whom had a mean PAP $>25 \text{mmHg}$. Dosing was administered for 4 days in the hospital to ensure tolerable side effect profile. In all three IPF patients, mean PAP decreased (mean 41 to 32 mmHg ) whereas the 6 -minute walk test distance increased (mean, 106.7-142 meters).</p>
                        <p>No adverse events were reported during a median 20 weeks of follow-up. The same group treated 16 patients with chronic lung or cardiac disease (twice with IPF) with sildenafil during a median of 22 months [52]. Both IPF patients exhibited an improvement in mean PAP during 8 weeks of therapy, which was maintained during longer-term follow-up. Overall, for the entire group, the distance on the 6 -minute walk test improved in the short term, a benefit that was preserved during long-term follow-up in 13 of 15 patients. It was not stated if these patients included those with IPF. Most recently, Collard and colleagues [53] administered sildenafil ($20-50 \text{ mg}$ tid) to 14 patients with IPF and PH (mean PAP $\geq 25 \text{mmHg}$ on RHC or estimated peak systolic $\geq 35 \text{mmHg}$ by echocardiography). Eleven patients finished at least 3 months of therapy (median follow-up, 91 days); three patients did not complete testing (two patients discontinued sildenafil as the result of side effects attributed to the drug and in one follow-up 6 -minute walk test was terminated because of chest discomfort in the patient). The mean improvement for all 11 patients was 49 meters ($90\%$ CI $17.5-84.0$ meters). Six-minute walk distance improved in nine patients, with more than half improving by more than $20\%$. The totality of these preliminary data, albeit in small numbers of IPF patients, suggested a benefit of this form of vasodilator therapy.</p>
                        <p>Lung transplantation is the only therapeutic option that has been suggested to improve survival in patients with IPF (54-56). The impact of lung transplantation on IPF patients with PH has not been specifically addressed. Interestingly, Whelan et al. [57] noted that preoperative PH is a poor prognostic indicator of post transplant survivorship in IPF patients. Patients with a mean PAP $>35 \text{mmHg}$ exhibited a $1.5$-fold increased risk of mortality. This finding was not supported by a smaller, single center study [58].</p>
                        <p>Some of this may reflect the type of transplant procedure as a bilateral procedure has been suggested to offer improved survival in the setting of PH [59]. Interestingly, the new organ allocation system in the USA is based on a severity stratification with the calculation of a lung allocation score [60]. Key factors that impact the medical urgency include diagnosis with IPF strongly impacting the score as does the inclusion of pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Interestingly, preliminary data suggest that this new system preferentially places IPF patients higher on the transplant wait list [61].</p>

                        <p>PH can complicate IPF and appears to be associated with impaired functional status and increased mortality. The prevalence varies but is likely worse in patients with more severe disease. Patients with impaired gas exchange and worse exercise capacity are at greater risk for suffering from PH , although predictive models based on physiological parameters display only modest diagnostic accuracy. BNP levels may be quite accurate, although available data in IPF patients are limited. The pathobiology is complex but likely includes pulmonary vasoconstriction and remodeling. Current therapeutic options are limited and include vasodilator therapy and lung transplantation. Unfortunately, little controlled data exist to suggest specific treatment regimens and duration of therapy. Additional prospective investigation in this arena is sorely needed.</p>
