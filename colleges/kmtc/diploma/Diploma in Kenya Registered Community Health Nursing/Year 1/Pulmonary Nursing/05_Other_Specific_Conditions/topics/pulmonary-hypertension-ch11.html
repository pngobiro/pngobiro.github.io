                        <p>Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown etiology [1]. A characteristic feature of sarcoidosis is its ability to affect multiple organs. However, the lung is the most common organ affected in sarcoidosis. In this chapter, we will focus on the pulmonary manifestations of sarcoidosis, including pulmonary hypertension, which can be a consequence of the disease.</p>

                        <p>Sarcoidosis is disease that is encountered world wide. However, it has a variable rate of incidence. Persons of Scandinavian and Irish descent in Europe and AfricanAmericans in the USA have a greater incidence than others. The highest prevalence has been estimated to be $2-5\%$ of these groups [2,3].</p>
                        <p>Although the disease often occurs in young adults, there is a second peak of incidence in women in their 60s [3]. In a large study of patients with newly diagnosed sarcoidosis in the USA, the median age was 40 years [4]. The disease appears to be more common in women than men, especially in African-American women and those women from Nordic populations [3,4].</p>
                        <p>Most patients with sarcoidosis have lung disease; however, the incidence of other organ involvement varies across the world. Table 11.1 demonstrates the reported incidence of various organs affected in different ethnic groups and different countries. One limitation of these data is the method of determining organ involvement. One instrument has been developed to define specific organ involvement in sarcoidosis [5]. Although it has been used in some studies, others have chosen their own definitions [6] or leave to individual institutions to determine organ involvement [7,8]. Despite these limitations, it is clear that sarcoidosis present in distinctly different ways based on ethnic background and one has to bear this in mind when assessing patients.</p>

                        <p>The etiology of sarcoidosis remains unknown, On the basis of current evidence, sarcoidosis appears to be a specific immunologic reaction that is the result of a environmental or infectious agent in a genetically susceptible host [9]. Several antigens have been proposed as possible causes of sarcoidosis. Although each of these has support, no single agent explains all cases of sarcoidosis. It is possible that sarcoidosis is caused by multiple agents, leading to a sarcoidosis-like reaction.</p>
                        <p>An infectious agent has always been appealing as the cause of sarcoidosis. The granulomatous response looks similar to that found with tuberculosis and many fungal infections. An increased risk for sarcoidosis has been noted in health care workers [10]. Sarcoidosis has also recurred in unaffected organs transplanted into sarcoidosis patients [11-13], including patients who have developed sarcoidosis after receiving a bone marrow transplant from a sarcoidosis patient [14,15]. Chromosomal studies have indicated that the granulomas occurring in the donor lung contain cells from the host [16]. Not all donor organs from a sarcoidosis patient lead to sarcoidosis [17].</p>
                        <p>Although Mycobacterium tuberculosis was originally thought to be the cause of sarcoidosis, several studies failed to confirm the presence of M. tuberculosis in most cases. The use of polymerase chain reaction has refuted this as the cause in most cases [18]. Some authors have found evidence of mycobacteria resembling M. tuberculosis in tissue of sarcoidosis patients [19]. In addition, a protein specific for mycobacteria has been found not only in sarcoidosis tissue, but also in the Kveim agent [20]. Antibodies to this protein were found in the majority of patients tested [20]. In another study, Th-1 response to these proteins from peripheral blood derived lymphocytes was found in the majority of sarcoidosis patients tested [21].</p>
                        <p>Another mycobacteria that had once been proposed as the cause of sarcoidosis is a cell wall-free mycobacteria. Initial reports found that nearly all sarcoidosis cases had these organisms in their blood. However, in a subsequent double-blind study conducted by several of these same investigators, the rate of positive blood cultures was the same for the controls as for the sarcoidosis patients [22]. Similar large blinded control studies have not been done with the other potential mycobacterium markers.</p>
                        <p>Propionibacterium acnes has also been proposed as a possible infectious agent. It has been found in tissue retrieved from sarcoidosis patients [23]. This was confirmed by a multinational study of sarcoidosis patients [24]. An animal model has been developed in which granulomas can be induced by P. acnes antigens [25].</p>
                        <p>Other studies have suggested possible environmental agents as a cause of sarcoidosis. For example, there is an increased rate of disease among fire fighters [26]. There was also an outbreak of "sarcoidosis" among seamen on aircraft carriers [27], with a reduction in cases diagnosed after measures were instituted to minimize exposure to titanium and other metals in dust on the surface of the ships [28]. Exposure to these inorganic dusts have been proposed as a cause of sarcoidosis [29].</p>
                        <p>In a case-controlled etiologic study of sarcoidosis (ACCESS), there was an increased risk for those in a moldy environment and exposed to insecticides in the year before diagnosis [30]. This risk was greater for those with pulmonary disease as their only manifestation of their sarcoidosis. In these cases with purely thoracic sarcoidosis, one wonders if this is just a sarcoid-like reaction on patients exposed to an inhaled agent. The same question arises from the cases of sarcoid-like disease associated with the World Trade Center disaster [31].</p>
                        <p>Another aspect of the sarcoidosis is the immunologic response. It is characteristically a greater immune response characterized by the formation of granulomas. This granulomatous response seems to be the result of an antigen being presented to CD-4 T lymphocyte through the major histochemical complex [32]. This complex is through the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) interaction. Berylliosis is another granulomatous disease in which certain HLA patterns are associated with increased risk for the disease [33]. In sarcoidosis, certain HLA patterns are associated with increased risk for disease [34]. The presence of HLA-DQB1*0201 is associated with a good clinical outcome [35] and Lofgren's syndrome [36]. The presence of other HLA patterns is associated with a lower risk for sarcoidosis [37].</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The diagnosis of sarcoidosis requires the combination of clinical presentation and laboratory support. The hallmark of sarcoidosis is the presence of noncaseating granulomas in one or more affected organs [38]. Although the presence of granulomas is an important part of the pathologic diagnosis, most patients do not have a biopsy as part of their initial evaluation.</p>
                        <p>Although granulomas may appear in biopsies from almost any organ, the most common area in which a diagnosis is made is the thorax, either by bronchoscopy or mediastinoscopy [39]. For pulmonary sarcoidosis, the most common presenting problems are cough, dyspnea, and abnormal chest roentgenogram. For patients with symptomatic pulmonary disease, the complaints can be fairly nonspecific. In one study, more than half of sarcoidosis patients with pulmonary symptoms saw a physician at least four times before a diagnosis was made [40]. One of the causes of delay in diagnosis was the time until a chest roentgenogram was performed. The usual diagnosis made at this point was asthma or respiratory infection. However, even after a chest roentgenogram was performed, there could be a delay in diagnosis. Patients with adenopathy were diagnosed more rapidly than those without adenopathy. The authors proposed that the presence of adenopathy raised the question of malignancy and hence a greater urgency for diagnosis [40]. Interestingly, patients with skin lesions were more rapidly diagnosed than those with only pulmonary disease [40].</p>
                        <p>The clinical features which support sarcoidosis are summarized in Table 11.2 [1,38]. Although none of these features is diagnostic for sarcoidosis, they can be highly suggestive of the diagnosis. For example, the presence of symmetrical hilar and right paratracheal adenopathy (Fig. 11.1) in an asymptomatic individual is almost always sarcoidosis [41].</p>

                        <p>The presence of extrapulmonary disease is an important clinical feature of sarcoidosis. It is a useful factor in confirming the diagnosis. For example ocular, cutaneous, and hepatic involvement are common features in patients with sarcoidosis. However, they are not encountered in other conditions commonly considered in the differential diagnosis, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or lymphoma. Also helpful are unusual, but relatively specific, complications of sarcoidosis such as nephrolithiasis [42], lupus pernio [43], or seventh cranial nerve paralysis [44].</p>
                        <p>As noted in Table 11.2, several laboratory tests are useful in supporting the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been used widely in the study of the cause of sarcoidosis [45,46]. Its role as a diagnostic test is controversial [47]. A major limitation of BAL has been the variability of the technique in both performing the procedure and analyzing the cells retrieved. Recommendations to standardize the technique and analysis have been made [48,49].</p>
                        <p>Using a standard approach to BAL, one can make some observations about its specificity in diagnosing sarcoidosis [50]. There are two abnormalities noted in the BAL fluid of patients with sarcoidosis: increased lymphocytes and an increased CD4:CD8 ratio. In general, an increased in percentage of lymphocytes was more sensitive and increase in a CD4:CD8 ratio was more specific for sarcoidosis [51-53]. Taking a Bayesian approach to determine the value of the CD4:CD8 ratio, Welker et al. [53] found that a ratio of 3.5 markedly enhanced the post-test probability of a diagnosis of sarcoidosis in patients with a moderate pretest probability.</p>

                        <p>Lung involvement has been reported in more than $90\%$ of patients in most series [3,4,54,55]. The traditional method of assessing patients has been by chest roentgenogram and pulmonary function studies. Chest roentgenogram has been classically categorized by the use of a stage system originally proposed by Scadding [56]. Stage 1 is adenopathy alone (Fig. 11.1), stage 2 adenopathy plus infiltrates, stage 3 is infiltrates alone, and stage 4 is fibrosis. Patients with normal chest roentgenogram are referred to as stage 0 [57]. The staging system has proved a useful way to stratify patients. Table 11.3 shows the proportion of patients in each of these stages at the time of diagnosis from three large series of sarcoidosis patients [4,6,55]. Each stage has been associated with a different prognosis. For example, patients with stage 1 changes have a $>80\%$ resolution of their chest roentgenogram within $2-5$ years [58.59], whereas those with stage 3 changes have a less than $30\%$ chance of resolution by that time [58].</p>

                        <p>A major limitation of the chest roentgenogram staging system is the fact that patients with stage 1 disease still have parenchymal lung disease. This can be demonstrated by bronchoscopy, with more than half of patients having a positive transbronchial biopsy [60]. BAL in stage 1 disease can also show a high percentage of lymphocytes and increased CD4:CD8 ratio, indicating an active alveolitis [61]. Gallium scan has also been positive in the parenchyma of patients with stage 1 disease [61,62].</p>
                        <p>The roentgenogram changes focus on the restrictive aspects of pulmonary sarcoidosis. The presence of interstitial lung disease by chest roentgenogram does correlate with pulmonary function and gas exchange abnormalities [63]. A normal chest roentgenogram does not predict normal lung function [4,55]. Loddenkemper et al. [55] studied new-onset disease in patients in Germany and Switzerland. They found that $12\%$ of patients with stage 1 disease had a vital capacity between $65\%$ and $80\%$ of predicted, whereas $64\%$ of patients with stage 3 disease had a normal vital capacity. In a study of 735 recently diagnosed cases of sarcoidosis in the USA, patients with more extensive lung involvement by chest roentgenogram had worse function. However, there was considerable overlap [64].</p>
                        <p>High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has been useful in demonstrating the fibrotic changes leading to loss of volume. The fibrotic pattern here includes not only interstitial thickening, but also honeycombing, linear nodules, and airway distortion [65] (Fig. 11.2). Figure 11.3 correlates the finding of these three main findings on CT scan and changes in pulmonary function in 68 patients studied at one institution [65]. It should be noted that obstructive disease was not a major feature of these patients, and there was no difference in the CT findings between the three groups.</p>

                            <figcaption><strong>Fig. 11.3</strong> The mean pulmonary function studies compared to HRCT patterns in 68 patients with sarcoidosis. The presence of honeycombing was associated with a significantly lower total lung capacity, forced vital capacity (FVC), and diffusion capacity (of the lung) for carbon monoxide ( DL${}_{\text{CO}}$) than the other patterns. (*$p < 0.001$, **$p < 0.0025$). There was no difference in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV-1)/FVC between the three groups. Adapted from Abehsera et al. [65]</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Although honeycombing is the predominant cause of lung function changes, there are other reasons for restrictive disease. In patients with less advanced disease, localized air trapping has been shown to be a cause of reduced lung volume [66]. The relative importance of the reticular nodular versus the localized air trapping was studied in 45 sarcoidosis patients by Hansell et al [67]. The authors found the reticulonodular pattern was the more important in predicting lung function. They found the mosaic pattern was not associated with significant airway obstruction.</p>
                        <p>Another cause of restrictive lung disease is muscle weakness [68,69]. This can be quantitated by measurements of the maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure. However, inspiratory and expiratory pressures also depend on lung volume, with lower volumes leading to lower pressures. Studies in sarcoidosis patients have demonstrated that muscle weakness is out of proportion to loss in lung volume [68]. This muscle weakness is associated with increasing dyspnea and worsening quality of life for the sarcoidosis patient [68,69]. Although this muscle weakness is usually due to direct muscle involvement, a neuropathy of the phrenic nerve can also lead to respiratory failure [70].</p>
                        <p>A co-factor here is the presence of obstructive lung disease. In some cases, the defect is combined with a restrictive defect. In one study of 715 European patients presenting with newly diagnosed sarcoidosis, 136 ($19\%$) presented with restrictive pattern alone, 29 ($4\%$) with obstructive pattern alone, and 22 ($3\%$) had a combined defect [55]. In a study of African Americans, Sharma and Johnson found obstruction in $63\%$ of the cases [71]. Cigarette smoking is another potential confounding issue, since it can cause airway obstruction [66]. However, a significant reduction in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio was seen in $12\%$ of nonsmokers in one study [64]. Sarcoidosis patients often have changes in the small airways [72]. These changes can lead to airway obstruction; however, they may not lead to significant changes in overall lung function [67].</p>
                        <p>One mechanism of obstruction is peribronchial thickening (Fig. 11.4). In addition, direct endobronchial involvement can be found in patients with sarcoidosis and can lead to significant airway narrowing. Endobronchial sarcoidosis involvement represents a distinct problem, because it can lead to irreversible bronchial stenosis [73]. In addition, a third of sarcoidosis patients appear to have airway reactivity as determined by a positive methacholine challenge [74-76]. In one study, airway hyperreactivity reactivity was associated with endobronchial disease [77].</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Cough is a common complaint in patients with sarcoidosis [38]. In one study of acute, symptomatic pulmonary sarcoidosis patients, all patients complained of cough. Only a third of the patients had a positive methacholine challenge. Neither the duration nor severity of the cough was associated with either a positive methacholine test or presence of airway obstruction [76].</p>
                        <p>The CT scan of the chest has proved useful in characterizing the type and extent of lung involvement in many interstitial lung diseases including sarcoidosis. Figure 11.5 demonstrates the chest roentgenogram and CT scan of patient with symptomatic pulmonary sarcoidosis. When using the CT scan, one can more readily appreciate the widespread nodularity. The presence of subpleural disease and adenopathy are also more readily apparent on CT scan than can be seen on plain chest roentgenogram [78,79]. Although this increased information is useful, it has not yet been translated to prognostic information.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Another aspect of pulmonary evaluation is exercise testing. Routine cardiopulmonary exercise tests have been found to be abnormal in the majority of sarcoidosis patients [80]. In one study in which authors examined exercise alveolar-arterial gradient, with more advanced disease found by chest roentgenogram, an increase in the arterial to alveolar gradient was seen [63]. This study also examined static lung function tests and found a strong correlation between gas exchange impairment and diffusion capacity (of the lung) for carbon monoxide [63].</p>
                        <p>The changes in exercise response can be due to changes in lung function, cardiac disease, muscle strength, or pulmonary hypertension. In one study, sarcoidosis patients with normal lung function had impaired exercise studies based on increased heart rate with exercise [81]. Thus, exercise testing reveals other possible causes of dyspnea. For example, it is clear that a significant number of sarcoidosis patients have increased pulmonary artery pressures [82,83]. Although this increase occurs most frequently in patients with stage 3 and 4 disease, pulmonary hypertension can occur in patients with stage 0 or 1 disease [83].</p>
                        <p>Although the major value of exercise testing in sarcoidosis is its ability to assess the patient who is complaining of dyspnea, another indication is to potentially screen for lung disease in patients with extra pulmonary presentation, such as ocular or neurologic disease. However, the testing can be complicated and difficult to reproduce between centers. It therefore remains most commonly performed at academic centers.</p>
                        <p>Recently, there has been interest in the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance in various interstitial lung diseases. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), walking less than 300 meters and the presence of desaturation are both associated with increased mortality [84]. The 6MWT has not been routinely evaluated in sarcoidosis. In one study of corticosteroid therapy for acute pulmonary sarcoidosis, there was some improvement in the 6MWT after 1 year of therapy, but the difference was not significant [76].</p>
                        <p>The 6MWT was prospectively studied in a group of unselected sarcoidosis patients [85]. Many factors were associated with a reduced 6MWT distance, including the percent forced vital capacity predicted (Fig. 11.6). However, the static lung function tests alone did not explain the 6MWD. The presence of pulmonary hypertension was an independent risk factor. In a multiregression analysis, it was found that the patient's perceived respiratory health, as measured by the Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (Fig. 11.7), was also a good predictor of 6MWT. Among quality of life factors affecting 6MWT, the presence of fatigue in patients with sarcoidosis predicted their 6MWT.</p>

                        <p>Pulmonary hypertension is a recognized complication of sarcoidosis [83,86]. The causes of pulmonary hypertension in this setting include direct vessel compression by adenopathy [87], arterial involvement (vasculitis) by sarcoidosis [88], pulmonary venous occlusion by granulomas [89,90], and liver disease with portopulmonary hypertension [91]. In addition, hypoxia, left ventricular disease, and pulmonary embolism may be encountered in patients with sarcoidosis.</p>
                        <p>The overall incidence of pulmonary hypertension in sarcoidosis reported by four groups is shown in Table 11.4. The greater percentage is similar to an older study, which also relied on catheterization study. The reported rate varies from $5\%$ to $60\%$ [82,83,92,93]. In the three studies in which the authors limited their evaluation to patients with dyspnea, the incidence of pulmonary hypertension was $50\%$. Handa et al. [93] conducted a prospective study of unselected sarcoidosis patients seen at a single clinic and found a lower incidence. In that study, all patients had echocardiography, but none had right heart catheterization data reported.</p>

                        <p>Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) may be estimated with the use of echocardiography and cardiac Doppler studies by applying the Bernoulli formula to tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity [94]. However, there are many limitations of this method, and echocardiography should therefore be considered a screening tool for the detection of pulmonary hypertension. In a study using echocardiography to screen for pulmonary hypertension in scleroderma [95], echocardiography was associated with both significant over- and underestimates of pulmonary artery pressure when compared with cardiac catheterization. In that study, the authors chose to study dyspneic patients with estimated PASP $30-40 \text{mmHg}$ (within the normal range). They found pulmonary hypertension by cardiac catheterization in half of these cases.</p>
                        <p>In patients with interstitial lung disease, the predictive accuracy of echocardiography may be even more limited. Arcasoy et al. [96] studied 374 patients with advanced lung disease and found that in $52\%$ of patients in whom correlation was possible, significant errors occurred when estimating PASP by echocardiography as compared with cardiac catheterization. In our experience, a significant number of sarcoidosis patients can have no detectable tricuspid regurgitation and still have significant pulmonary hypertension. Figure 11.8 shows the results of 91 patients studied at our institution with both echocardiogram and right heart catheterization. In 29 ($32\%$), the PA pressure could not be estimated by the echocardiographer. Even for those in whom a PA estimate was made, there was only fair correlation between the estimated PA pressure and the directly measured number ($r=0.56, p < 0.001$).</p>

                        <p>Several factors account for the predictably limited correlation between echocardiographic and catheter-derived measurements of PASP, and include (1) the time interval between noninvasive and invasive studies; (2) population studied (e.g., left heart failure patients versus patients with advanced lung disease); (3) the occurrence of marked spontaneous variation in PASP [97]; (4) the investigators' definition of pulmonary hypertension; (5) method of estimation of right atrial pressure; (6) failure to precisely capture the peak velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation jet on Doppler studies; (7) chest configuration; and (8) orientation of the heart within the chest.</p>

                        <p>In patients with sarcoidosis who are awaiting lung transplantation, pulmonary hypertension has been noted in more than $70\%$ of cases [98,99]. However, it is important to note that the presence of pulmonary hypertension (mean PAP $>25 \text{mmHg}$) does not necessarily imply the presence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (mean PAP $>25 \text{mmHg}$, mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure $<15 \text{mmHg}$, and pulmonary vascular resistance $>3$ Wood units). In a more detailed analysis of patients awaiting lung transplantation [100], it was found that the pulmonary artery wedge pressure increased as the PASP increased, suggesting that at least some cases of pulmonary hypertension are caused by left ventricular disease. Direct left ventricular involvement may be seen in sarcoidosis and may result in either systolic or diastolic left ventricular dysfunction [101,102]. In a study of 80 dyspneic sarcoidosis patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, 47 ($59\%$) had elevated PASP; diastolic dysfunction either alone or in combination with systolic dysfunction accounted for one quarter of these cases [92]. Table 11.5 summarizes the vital capacity and chest x-ray findings of those patients with and those without left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in a study done at our institution [103]. As can be seen, these measurements do not provide sufficient information to separate the two groups. While echocardiography and cardiac Doppler studies may be helpful in suggesting the presence of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, cardiac catheterization is often required to make a specific diagnosis.</p>

                        <p>Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of systemic therapy for sarcoidosis patients. It is crucial to realize that not all patients require therapy. There remain some specific recommendations regarding who should receive therapy [38]. Certain conditions are felt to be absolute indications for therapy. These include cardiac, neurologic, ocular disease not responding to topical therapy, and hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria. Pulmonary involvement by itself does not require therapy. However, patients with dyspnea or troublesome cough should be considered for therapy. Liver involvement is rarely symptomatic, but some patients may develop irreversible cirrhosis and should be treated [104,105]. Skin involvement may respond to topical therapy. However, extensive disease or chronic problems such as lupus pernio [43] are often controlled by systemic therapy. Other organ involvement may also lead to sufficient symptoms to require therapy. Evidence-based guidelines for therapy of sarcoidosis have been established [106]. These are summarized in Table 11.6. These recommendations include the level of evidence which supports each conclusion.</p>

Also shown is the proportion of patients requiring long-term therapy if they did not receive initial systemic therapy for their sarcoidosis [108,110].</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Systemic therapy is not required in all cases of sarcoidosis. In large studies, the proportion of patients requiring initial therapy ranges from $34\%$ to $65\%$ [107-110]. As shown in Figure 11.9, many patients who are started on therapy will require chronic therapy for at least 2 years 107-110. Long-term therapy is usually required either because the patient could not be withdrawn from treatment, or symptoms recurred when treatment was stopped. Relapses usually occurred within 6 months of withdrawal from therapy, but could occur up to 6 years later [108]. For those patients not requiring initial systemic therapy, there was a less than $10\%$ chance of needing long term therapy [108,110].</p>
                        <p>For symptomatic pulmonary disease, corticosteroid therapy has been the most widely studied [111]. Treatment with prednisone has been shown to improve the chest roentgenogram [111]. Eighteen months of corticosteroid therapy for patients with parenchymal lung disease has been shown to improve the DLCO [112], and this benefit could persist for up to 5 years after treatment [113]. A similar improvement was seen in the vital capacity [113,114]. The initial dose of corticosteroids has varied considerably among trials. In one trial demonstrating benefit for therapy, 3 months of high-dose oral corticosteroids were followed by fifteen months of high dose inhaled budesonide [112,113].</p>
                        <p>Another issue that has been poorly studied is the withdrawal of corticosteroids. It has been suggested that the sarcoidosis patient should usually be given a high dose of therapy initially and then maintained at a lower dose [115]. The trick is to give the lowest dose that does not lead to relapse. Corticosteroid dose tapering is usually done to avoid toxicity [76]. If the patient is tolerating the current dose, the regimen may be maintained longer to maximize benefit.</p>
                        <p>Alternatives to corticosteroids have been sought because of steroid toxicity. Table 11.7 lists many of these drugs, their usual doses, and recommended monitoring. As noted in Table 11.6, recommendations regarding alternatives to corticosteroids in treating sarcoidosis are often based on limited studies [116]. The two most thoroughly studied drugs are chloroquine and methotrexate.</p>

                        <p>Chloroquine and is derivative hydroxychloroquine make up the anti-malarial class of drugs. Chloroquine has been more extensively studied and found effective for cutaneous disease [117-119]. The response rate to chloroquine appears to be lower in pulmonary disease [106,118]. Chloroquine was also found to slow the progression of chronic pulmonary disease [120]. Hydroxychloroquine has also been used for cutaneous disease, but the response rate seems lower than that of chloroquine [106,121]. Since chloroquine is associated with more ocular toxicity [122124], hydroxychloroquine is used more frequently. The antimalarials have also been reported as effected in treating hypercalcemia [125-127] and neurologic disease [128] complicating sarcoidosis.</p>
                        <p>Methotrexate is another widely studied drug in sarcoidosis [129-133]. It has been reported to be useful in treating pulmonary [132,133], cutaneous [132-134], ocular [130,132,133], and neurologic [133,135] manifestations. It has been used in treating childhood sarcoidosis, in which the clinician must try to avoid systemic corticosteroids [136]. In a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial, the use of methotrexate was found to be steroid sparing for patients with acute pulmonary sarcoidosis [137].</p>
                        <p>Methotrexate is a cytotoxic agent. Like all the drugs in this class, one needs to monitor the complete blood count on a regular basis when administering this agent [129]. Because bone marrow involvement can be seen in sarcoidosis [138,139], we prefer to use a relatively low dose of methotrexate. The drug is excreted by the kidney and probably should not be used in patients with significant renal dysfunction [132]. Chronic use is associated with hepatotoxicity, which can be detected by liver biopsy [140]. The use of liver function tests alone versus routine liver biopsy to screen for methotrexate hepatotoxicity is controversial [140,141]. Pulmonary toxicity is also associated with methotrexate use [142,143]. This is less frequent and may only manifest itself with cough. In patients with methotrexate associated cough, discontinuation of drug seems to be adequate to control the complaint [132,144].</p>
                        <p>Azathioprine is another cytotoxic agent used to treat sarcoidosis. The response rate reported to date has been variable, from as little as $20\%$ [145] to more than $80\%$ [146]. In addition to pulmonary disease, the drug has been reported as effective for neurologic [147] and hepatic [148] disease. Unfortunately, the response rates of azathioprine for sarcoidosis are difficult to estimate based on the small number of treated patients reported to date [106]. Complete blood counts need to be monitored during azathioprine therapy. In particular, one must monitor for thiopurine methyltransferase-deficiency, which can lead to profound neutropenia even with small doses of the drug [149].</p>
                        <p>Other cytotoxic agents used for the treatment of patients with sarcoidosis include leflunomide, chlorambucil, and cyclophosphamide. Leflunomide has a similar mechanism of action to methotrexate and has been used in combination with that drug in treating rheumatoid arthritis [150,151]. The drug is associated with less nausea and pulmonary toxicity than methotrexate [152]. For sarcoidosis, leflunomide has been effective in more than two-thirds of patients either in place of methotrexate or in combination with the drug [144]. Chlorambucil has also been shown to be steroid sparing in sarcoidosis [153,154]. However, it is an alkylating agent and associated with a higher rate of cancer than the other cytotoxic drugs. Cyclophosphamide has been effective in over $90\%$ of the patients reported to date [135,155]. It is usually given as intermittent, intravenous treatments to reduce toxicity. It is associated with a higher rate of nausea and bone marrow toxicity, which can be minimized with antiemetics and careful monitoring [156]. Hemorrhagic cystitis and bladder cancer are associated with prolonged use, especially if the drug is given orally [157]. Therefore, despite its greater rate of response, cyclophosphamide is usually reserved for refractory disease, including neurologic disease [135,155,158-160].</p>
                        <p>Thalidomide has been reported in several case reports to be effective for cutaneous sarcoidosis [43,161-165]. It is a serious teratogen and the drug use must be carefully monitored. The drug was originally marketed as a sleep aid, and hypersomnolence remains a dose limiting effect. Other toxicities are dose dependent and include constipation and peripheral neuropathy [43]. In a dose escalation trial, the effective dose for skin lesions was 100 mg a day in most cases [43]. That dose has limited benefit for extracutaneous manifestations [43,161,163]. In a careful study of thalidomide for pulmonary sarcoidosis, Judson et al [166] were only able to identify a modest steroid sparing effect at a dose that could be tolerated by the patients.</p>
                        <p>Excessive levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) released by alveolar macrophages have been found in patients with active sarcoidosis [167,168]. A decrease in the amount of TNF-$\alpha$ released has been seen after successful treatment of sarcoidosis with corticosteroids [169], methotrexate [169], and azathioprine [146]. Persistently high levels have been found in patients with refractory sarcoidosis [170]. These observations have led to the concept of targeting TNF-$\alpha$ as a treatment for sarcoidosis [171].</p>
                        <p>Biological agents which target TNF-$\alpha$ have been developed for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. These include etanercept, a TNF-$\alpha$ receptor antagonist, and infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody which binds TNF-$\alpha$ in the plasma as well as TNF-$\alpha$ on the cell surface [172]. Both of these drugs are effective for rheumatoid arthritis [173,174], but infliximab has proved more effective for Crohn's disease [175,176]. There is also a much greater risk for reactivation of tuberculosis associated with infliximab versus etanercept [177].</p>
                        <p>For sarcoidosis, infliximab has been reported effective in several case reports and series [178-182]. A recently completed double blind, placebo-controlled trial of chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis confirmed the effectiveness of infliximab. In that study, there was a significant increase in the forced vital capacity after 24 weeks of infliximab therapy [183]. The effect was greater for patients with more severe disease. Although the drug was well tolerated in that study and no significant side effects were encountered, others have found that infliximab is associated with allergic reactions [184], increased risk for infections [177], worsening of preexisting congestive heart failure [185], and probable increased rate of malignancy [184].</p>
                        <p>Etanercept has been shown to have a much more limited role in treating sarcoidosis. In an open label trial of pulmonary sarcoidosis, a third of patients deteriorated while on treatment and the trial was discontinued [186]. In a double-blind trial of etanercept for refractory ocular sarcoidosis, there was no difference between etanercept and placebo [187]. Etanercept shares many of the toxicities as infliximab, including possible worsening of preexisting congestive heart failure [188] and increased rate of malignancy [189]. The risk for infection and allergic reaction is smaller, but these complications still can occur.</p>
                        <p>There are several possible reasons for the difference in effectiveness of infliximab versus etanercept for sarcoidosis. These include differences in mode of action of the drug (monoclonal antibody versus receptor antagonist), peak levels of drug (intravenous versus subcutaneous administration), effect on transmembrane TNF-$\alpha$ (only seen with infliximab) [190], and cell lysis. Infliximab binds to TNF-$\alpha$ on surface of cells releasing that protein. That has been shown to lead to cell lysis and therefore reduction of the overall number of active inflammatory cells [191]. Etanercept does not bind to cells or lead to cell lysis [191].</p>
                        <p>Other drugs have been reported as possibly effective in treating sarcoidosis. Minocycline has been shown to be effective in treating cutaneous sarcoidosis [192], as have fumaric acid esters [193]. Pentoxifylline has been reported to be suseful in some cases of sarcoidosis [194]. This drug is a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor and has anti-TNF-$\alpha$ activity [195,196]. However, the drug is associated with gastrointestinal toxicity and seems to have a limited role in sarcoidosis.</p>

                         <span class="heading-text">Treatment of Sarcoidosis Associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (SAPAH)</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>As noted previously, SAPAH is often encountered in sarcoidosis patients awaiting lung transplant. The presence of pulmonary hypertension is a risk factor for death while awaiting lung transplant [98,99]. Right heart failure with associated elevation of right atrial pressure is associated with an even higher risk for death [99,197]. Although lung transplantation is one approach to this condition, medical treatment of SAPAH may increase the patient's likelihood of surviving to transplant. In addition, successful medical management may avoid the need for transplant altogether.</p>
                        <p>Medical management of SAPAH is similar to that outlined for idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. The guidelines for diagnosis and treatment are discussed elsewhere in this book and the principals have been adapted for SAPAH. However, the information available to date is limited regarding the outcome of treatment in these patients.</p>
                        <p>Several groups have found that sarcoidosis associated pulmonary arterial hypertension respond to epoprostenol in both the acute and chronic setting [198,199]. In one study of seven patients treated with long term epoprostenol, five of seven continued on long-term therapy. Only one of five patients given long-term therapy went on to require lung transplant, while the remaining four have done well [199]. Others have reported the usefulness of epoprostenol in the long-term management of SAPAH [92].</p>
                        <p>The use of the endothelin receptors antagonist bosentan has also been reported to be successful in treating some patients with SAPAH [92,200,201]. The use of this class of drugs is appealing, because increased levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels have been detected in the blood and BAL of patients with sarcoidosis [202,203]. In one study of BAL samples, the source of the increased amounts of ET-1 were the alveolar macrophages [203]. This same group demonstrated that BAL supernatant from sarcoidosis patients stimulated fibroblast proliferation and that this could be blocked by an inhibitor which blocked both ET${}_{\text{A}}$ and ET${}_{\text{B}}$. Thus, blockade of ET-1 receptors may not only treat SAPAH, but also treat the lung fibrosis often seen in these sarcoidosis patients. The latter hypothesis has not yet been studied.</p>
                        <p>Sildenafil has been successfully used to treat idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension [204]. It has also been shown to improve hemodynamics [205] and 6MWT in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [206]. A recent report indicated that it improved hemodynamics in sarcoidosis patients awaiting lung transplant who had significant pulmonary arterial hypertension [207]. Table 11.8 summarizes the experience of treatment with these two vasodilators studied to date for SAPAH. Although the reported experience remains small, it is clear that some patients do respond to these agents. Clinical trials looking at these and other agents are ongoing in SAPAH.</p>

                        <p>Sarcoidosis is one of the most common idiopathic interstitial lung diseases. Although the prognosis for patients is often good, there is a subset of chronic disease. These patients often require years of corticosteroids and steroid-sparing agents to control their disease. Pulmonary hypertension is a frequent complication of advanced pulmonary disease. Some of the treatments for idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension have also been successful in treating sarcoidosis associated pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p>
