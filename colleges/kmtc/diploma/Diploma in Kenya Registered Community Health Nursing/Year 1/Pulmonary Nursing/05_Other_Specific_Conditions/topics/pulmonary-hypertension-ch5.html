                        <p>The most common causes of pulmonary hypertension (PH) are related to the impairment of cardiac and pulmonary function. Impaired pulmonary venous drainage caused by left heart failure, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and mitral valve disease are among the most frequently encountered causes; however, remarkably, severe pulmonary hypertension resulting from heart failure is not a common finding. Chronic hypoxemia associated with structural and functional disorders of the lung is also a major cause of pulmonary hypertension. Crucially, it is reversible with long-term oxygen therapy. An update of this subject at the World Symposium on Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (Venice 2003) classified PH in five classes, as shown in Table 5.1. [1] Genetic factors, pulmonary vascular physiology, pathophysiology, PH, as well as interstitial lung diseases (ILD), diagnosis, and management of the secondary forms of pulmonary hypertension are reviewed in Chapter 2. In this chapter, a clinical view of epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, natural history, and the management of idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension (IPAH), formerly known as primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), will be reviewed. Although IPAH is a rare condition, because of its pathogenetic link with the use of anorexigen medications such as fenfluramine, phentermine, and dexfenfluramine, all physicians should be aware of this potentially fatal disease.</p>

                                <p>PPH is a rare and usually rapidly progressive disorder characterized by an increase in pulmonary resistance which, if untreated leads to right ventricular failure and death within a few years. The diagnostic criteria developed by the National Institutes of Health Registry include a mean pulmonary artery (PAPm) pressure greater than 25 mmHg at rest, or 30 mmHg with exercise, determined by right heart catheterization [2], and no evidence of left-sided myocardial, valvular, or congenital heart disease (with the exception of high flow and low pressure shunts, as will be discussed), no clinically significant lung disease, pulmonary emboli, or active vasculitis. PPH is often not suspected and the diagnosis can be delayed for more than 2 years after the onset of symptoms [3]. The three classic pathologic signs are pulmonary arteriolar hypertrophy with obliterating arteriolar plexiform lesions and, much less commonly, pulmonary veno occlusive disease and pulmonary hemangiomatosis.</p>
                                <p>Shortly after the initial reports describing young women with "idiopathic" (primary) severe pulmonary hypertension and unusual arteriolar plexiform lesions, PH with plexiform lesions was attributed to the drug aminorex fumarate, an anorectic agent used in Europe in the 1960s. The same pathologic and clinical syndrome has been associated with the newer weight-reducing agents [4]. Since the early 1970s, autosomal-dominant familial forms of PPH have been described along with several other exogenous triggers active in susceptible individuals.</p>

                                <p>PPH is a rare disease, with an estimated incidence of one to two cases per million in the general population. Approximately 400 new cases are diagnosed annually in the USA. PPH is most prevalent in patients who are in their twenties through their forties, and no racial differences in the rate of occurrence have been observed [3]. When diagnosed during childhood, it affects both sexes equally; however, after puberty, the condition is more common in women (ratio 1.7:1). In a number of cases, PPH may be associated with other disorders such as HIV ($0.5\%$ of infected patients) [5], liver cirrhosis (2-4\%), and portal hypertension. In addition, $10-20\%$ of patients with systemic scleroderma may develop PPH [6].</p>
                                <p>In 17 PAH referral centers of the French national prospective registry (ItinerAIRHTAP) from October 2002 to October 2003, an investigation of 674 patients (mean $\pm$ SD age, $50 \pm 15$ years; female $65.3\%$) indicated that $52.6\%$ of those enrolled presented either primary ($39.2\%$), familial ($3.9\%$), or anorexigen-associated PH ($9.5\%$). Systemic scleroderma or other autoimmune diseases, appetite suppressants, congenital heart disease, portal hypertension, and human deficiency virus infection accounted for $15.3\%$, $11.3\%$, $10.4\%$, and $6.2\%$ of population, respectively. Most patients had severe disease at the time of diagnosis (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class IV, $12\%$; NYHA class III, $63\%$; NYHA class I-II, $25\%$ respectively) [7].</p>
                                <p>A number of studies suggest that the postmortem diagnosis is greater than the clinical diagnosis and is in the region of 1/1,000. The sporadic form of PPH is two to five times more common in women than men. This female predominance is not observed in the childhood form of PPH. These observations, together with the frequent peripartum presentation and association with oral contraceptives, indicate that estrogens may play a role in the initiation or progression of the disease. The average adult age of onset is the early to mid-thirties. The classic paradigm is a young, obese woman with a past history of migraine headaches and/or Reynaud's phenomenon who presents with fatigue, dyspnoea, chest pain, and/or syncope.</p>
                                <p>We have idiopathic, familial, and then, we have pulmonary arterial hypertension related to a number of conditions. The most frequent are the connective tissue diseases and, of those, scleroderma spectrum of disease. PPH is also triggered by several common conditions, including HIV infection, portal hypertension and cirrhosis, exposure to cocaine, L-tryptophan, and anorectic agents was showed in Table 5.2. The widespread use of the anorectic dexfenfluramine was predicted to increase the incidence of PPH by 20- to 50-fold or 1 per 16,000 users [4].</p>
                                <p>Fortunately, with the withdrawal of the drug from the US market, the epidemic of PPH that was previously anticipated may not come true.</p>

                                <p>Histopathologic and clinical studies suggest that PPH is a disease of the genetically predisposed individual in whom various triggers initiate the characteristic vascular lesions. Twenty percent of patients previously classified as having PPH are now thought to have a familiar form of the disease. There are indications that the PPH1 gene, a bone morphogenic protein receptor 2 gene (BMPR2), may be implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease (Fig. 5.1). The genetic background of this disease will be better elucidated in Chapter 2. Vasoconstriction followed by remodeling of the pulmonary vessels is a primary event in the pathogenesis of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) (Fig. 5.2). Additional pathogenetic mechanisms such as inflammation suggest that increased of LIGHT levels, i.e., mediated prothrombotic effects in endothelial cells, could contribute to disease progression in PAH [9].</p>

                                <p>The symptoms associated with PPH do not differ from those of secondary PH (Table 5.3). The common striking finding is the symptoms of dyspnoea and fatigue disproportionate to the clinical appearance of the patient. HIV-positive patients with dyspnoea should be investigated for PAH, which is diagnosed in $85\%$ of these patients. Recently, a screening algorithm based on a dyspnoea questionnaire, transthoracic Doppler echocardiography, and right heart catheterization was applied in routine clinical practice and showed good results identifying different degrees of PAH severity [11].</p>
                                <p>In PPH, most symptoms are attributable to reduced cardiac output. Lightheadedness, syncope, and presyncope with effort and Valsalva's manoeuvres are the result of systemic vasodilatation without accompanying increase in right heart output and inadequate LV filling pressures. Anginal chest pains may result from RV ischemia or pulmonary artery distension. Patients with PPH are noticeably sensitive to both the increase in rate and loss of atrial filling pressure in atrial fibrillation or flutter. In the later stages of PPH, palpitations may be caused by ventricular tachy arrhythmias. Death can be attributable to primary ventricular fibrillation (VF), VF secondary to hypotension, or terminal right heart failure and cardiogenic shock.</p>
                                <p>The typical patient has been told by at least one physician the symptoms are the result of anxiety. Patients typically delay seeking medical attention for 6 months, but the interval between symptom onset and diagnosis is generally delayed by 2 years. A history of Reynaud's phenomenon is frequent, but may not exceed that observed in the general population.</p>
                                <p>Although the diagnosis is difficult, once symptoms are present, the physical examination is invariably consistent with pulmonary hypertension (Table 5.3). Peripheral oedema is rare ($10\%$) until late in the disease. Cyanosis, a late finding, results from low cardiac output and peripheral vasoconstriction, or arterial desaturation via a right to left shunt through an atrial septal defect or probe patent foramen oval, or with classic Eisenmenger syndrome, reversal of shunt, right-to-left shunt. Digital clubbing and hypoxemia suggest cyanotic congenital heart or pulmonary diseases.</p>

                                <p>Overall 5-year survival of untreated PPH is approximately $20\%$ [8], with a median survival of 2.8 years (NYHA class I-II, 6 years; Class III, 2.5 years; Class IV, 6 months) [2]. It is nearly universally fatal with only a few reports of disease regression. The median survival of patients with PPH associated with systemic scleroderma was reported to be only one year [12,13]. Various parameters have been used to define the severity of disease for prognosis and mortality, including NYHA functional class, exercise capacity, and haemodynamics. Cardiac output, the right atrial (RA) PAPm, and NYHA class correlate inversely with survival, whereas the cardiac index is directly correlated [14]. The strongest negative prognostic indicator is the presence and severity of pericardial effusion on echocardiogram, [15] which may be a function of the severity of the right heart failure.</p>

                                <p>Pulmonary function testing (PFT) is usually normal, but in later stages (NYHA class $\geq$ III, symptoms with less than every day activity) can demonstrate a mild restrictive pattern and decrease in carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DL${}_{\text{CO}}$) as the result of low cardiac output. Particularly PFT with DL${}_{\text{CO}}$ may be useful in the presence of an isolated decrease of DL${}_{\text{CO}} <55\%$ of normal or an increase in the forced vital capacity (FVC)/DL${}_{\text{CO}}$ ratio (FVC/DL${}_{\text{CO}} >1.4$) [16]. However, moderate or severe abnormalities on PFT are unusual and should prompt consideration of other aetiologies for PH, particularly ILD.</p>
                                <p>Serologic studies are obtained to exclude rheumatologic diseases. The antinuclear antibody can be elevated in PPH, but rarely exceeds 1/320. An elevated sedimentation rate or ANA > 1/320 suggest systemic lupus, scleroderma, CREST, or mixed connective tissue disease. The only manifestation of lupus may be pulmonary hypertension. Patients with an established diagnosis of PPH should continually be suspect for occult scleroderma or lupus.</p>
                                <p>Anticardiolipin antibodies can be present in PPH. Increased plasma levels of a number of biochemical markers have been reported in patients with PAH, including uric acid, endothelin, and B-type natriuretic peptide. These markers showed correlations with prognostic factors for PAH , and some biochemicals have independent prognostic value [17-19]. Mutation in the BMPR2 gene has been identified in families with family PAH [20].</p>
                                <p>When pulmonary hypertension is suspected, an echo Doppler should be conducted to confirm an increase in the right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP). Although the upper limit for RVSP on echo Doppler is $30-40 \text{mmHg}$, even mildly symptomatic patients with PPH have an RVSP of $50-60 \text{mmHg}$, the right ventricle is often dilated, and there is a degree of tricuspid insufficiency. The classic findings on echocardiography [21] include enlarged RA and RV, a normal-to-small LV, abnormal septal motion, and some increase in septal thickness. Mitral valve prolapse is common and explained by a change in the left ventricular size and geometry with RV dilation. If the RVSP is increased, contrast enhancement (injection of agitated saline) should be used to exclude an atrial septal defect and probe patent foramen oval. The latter should be suspected when cyanosis and or hypoxia are present. Transesophageal echocardiography may offer additional information regarding intracardiac shunts but is not essential.</p>
                                <p>Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy is essential in the evaluation of PH. In PPH, the V/Q scan is normal or low probability with patchy defects. In contrast, chronic thromboembolic PH has at least one major ventilation perfusion mismatch [22]. Rare complications have occurred from macro aggregated albumin during V/Q scanning in persons with severe pulmonary hypertension and critically obstructed pulmonary vascular bed [23].</p>
                                <p>Pulmonary angiography is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PPH; however, it should be performed by experienced radiologists when thromboembolism is suspected. The pulmonary angiogram in PPH demonstrates symmetrically enlarged primary and secondary branches and pruning or loss of branching from tertiary vessels. Intraluminal filling defects and vascular webs are characteristic of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Magnetic resonance angiography and helical computer tomography are effective screening tools for excluding central thromboembolic PH, but do not exclude thromboembolic disease. Because in-situ thrombi occur in PPH, and chronic thromboemboli can result in severe PH, the differential diagnosis is not always possible. In this setting pulmonary angiography may be necessary but should be performed only by teams (radiology, thoracic surgery, and cardiology) with experience in pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.</p>
                                <p>A right heart catheterization is necessary in PPH to confirm the diagnosis, estimate prognosis, and perform a vasodilator trial to determine the therapeutic options. These studies should be performed by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and management of all forms of pulmonary hypertension. In moderate-to-severe PH, an increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure suggests left heart failure (diastolic dysfunction) and mitral valve disease. If heart disease can be excluded, the PPH variant pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) must be considered. When RV diastolic and RA pressures are $>12-15 \text{mmHg}$ in PPH the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is increased to $12-18 \text{mmHg}$ from compression of the LV. Intracardiac shunts are excluded by multiple site venous oxygen sampling and arterial blood gas analysis. Four deaths reported with right heart catheterization in the Mayo Clinic PPH series [10] emphasized the risk in these patients.</p>
                                <p>A lung biopsy is not essential for diagnosis of PPH and is rarely used in clinical practice. Exceptions include patients with a differential diagnosis of collagen vascular disease and PPH (lupus pulmonary vasculitis) and to distinguish PVOD for which therapy is considerably different.</p>

                            <div class="content-card">
                                <p>The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Consensus statement [24] recommends that patients with PPH should be managed by teams of experienced specialists: "Because PPH is a rare disease whose complexity poses tremendous challenges to the treating physician, it is recommended that patients be referred to a center with experience in the management of this disease. The referring physician must, nevertheless, play a major role in the day to day care of these patients."</p>
                                <p>Once the diagnosis is established, counseling should focus on psychosocial adjustment to a changing life style and the stress of a life-threatening illness to the patient and significant others. The patient should refrain from activities that cause fatigue and exertion, with their activity guided by symptoms. Physical and mental stress increase sympathoadrenal discharge that increases pulmonary artery pressure and stresses the failing right ventricle. Airplane travel in pressurized cabins is safe if the patient's resting oxygen saturation is normal. The hemodynamic and hormonal changes of pregnancy are deleterious and necessitate measures to avoid conception. Unfortunately, oral contraceptives and estrogen supplements should be avoided because estrogens may promote or trigger the disease and increase the risk of in situ pulmonary artery thrombosis.</p>
                                <p>Recently the Health and Science Policy Committee of the ACCP authorized an update of the medical treatment guidelines published in 2004 [25] to describe and clarify new treatments which promise to open new therapeutic avenues [26]. When choosing a therapeutic option physicians should consider cardiopulmonary haemo dynamics, the results of a 6-minute walk test (6MWT), sign and symptoms of rightheart failure, side effect, drug-drug interaction, and the costs for every selected patient [26].</p>

                                        <p>Medical therapy is both nonspecific (treating right heart failure) and specific (aimed at reducing pulmonary artery pressure). The nonspecific arm of treatment includes improving RV function, which reduces the dyspnoea, fatigue, and peripheral oedema. Digitalis is recommended to increase RV contractility. Because more than $75\%$ of PPH patients are overweight or obese and cannot exercise, caloric restriction for weight reduction is critical. The diet should be low in saturated fat and salt ($\leq 2 \text{ g}$ of sodium), and caloric adjusted to reduce to ideal body weight. Obesity worsens the clinical course of PPH placing an incremental burden on the failing RV. Although excess physical activity is harmful, regular low-level exercise to maintain upper and lower body tone and strength is necessary.</p>
                                        <p>Diuretics are effective for treating oedema, but caution with their use is necessary. Minimally decreased intravascular volume can result in profound hypotension and sudden death from underfilling of the left ventricle. Spironolactone is particularly effective for hepatic congestion and ascites, and can be used effectively in conjunction with loop diuretics.</p>
                                        <p>Anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended (INR of 2-3) as pathologic studies indicate a major contribution of in situ thrombosis to the progression of PPH [27,28]. Markers of in vivo clotting and thrombolysis provide further evidence for reoccurring thrombosis in PPH [29]. Nonrandomized observational data suggest a salutary effect of anti-coagulants on prognosis [10,30]. The level of evidence for these medications to be used in PPH is level C, there are no randomized trials proving the efficacy of treatment. However, there is a strong recommendation for the use of diuretics, especially for patients with fluid overload. In this group, anticoagulants and digitalis are recommended and so is oxygen therapy in combination. The benefit of digitalis is uncertain and is grade IIB-C.</p>

                                        <p>In patients with evidence of pulmonary vasodilator reserve (>20% reduction in PAPm or pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR]), the oral calcium channel blockers (CCBs) nifedipine and diltiazem may reduce symptoms and prolong life in selected patients [30]. The ACCP consensus statement strongly recommends a monitored therapeutic trial and not empiric use of CCBs [24]. The trial is performed in the catheterization laboratory with a balloon flotation catheter and arterial line. Inhaled nitric oxide, intravenous adenosine, or intravenous prostacyclins are administered to measure acute pulmonary vasodilator reserve. A reduction in PAPm and or PVR by $\geq 20\%$ suggests that CCBs may be effective. However, if the PVR is $>10-12$ Wood units or right ventricle has failed represented by a high RA pressure or low cardiac output, CCBs should be avoided. Recently Sitbon et al. [31] further clarified the role of CCBs in the PPH population. As a result, a favourable response is now defined as fall in PAPm $\geq 10 \text{mmHg}$ to PAPm $\leq 40 \text{ mm Hg}$, with unchanged or increased cardiac output. PPH patients who meet these criteria may be treated with CCBs. Patients responding to CCBs and not on any other PPH treatment, were included in their corresponding NYHA functional class I or II [26]. Although approximately $25\%$ of patients responded to oral therapy, even the initial administration of a small dose ($10-20 \text{ mg}$) of nifedipine was associated with severe systemic hypotension and death (approximately $10\%$ combined).</p>
                                        <p>The optimal dose of CCBs is not known. Neither a dose finding nor randomized control trial comparing calcium channel blockade to placebo in patients with pulmonary vasodilator reserve has been performed. Although we have patients who are stable or improved on nifedipine for $1-15$ years, it is possible that the pulmonary vasodilator reserve predicts a more benign form of the disease independent of treatment. Patients who demonstrate adequate pulmonary vasodilator reserve with nitric oxide, adenosine, or prostacyclin undergo a standardized hemodynamic trial of hourly nifedipine or diltiazem. After the trial, responders receive high-dose nifedipine ($120-240 \text{ mg}$) or diltiazem ($360-500 \text{ mg}$ per day) with close monitoring. Long-acting nifedipine or diltiazem, or amlodipine are advisable. By contrast, verapamil should be avoided for its potential negative inotropic effects.</p>

                                        <p>Intravenous epoprostenol has markedly improved the quality of life and changed the natural history of PPH. Epoprostenol is a short-acting analogue of the naturally occurring vasodilator prostacyclin (PGI2), with a $3-$ to $5-\text{min}$ half-life. It can acutely reduce PVR and increases cardiac output and oxygen transport. The absence of an initial positive effect and reduction in PVR does not predict the subsequent benefit. The latter may be due to vascular remodeling, gradual improvement in RV function, and antiplatelet/thrombotic effects. When compared with conventional therapy in a 3-month trial, epoprostenol improved symptoms and short-term survival in class III and IV patients [32].</p>
                                        <p>Most experts recommended intravenous epoproprostenol as the first-line of treatment for unstable patients in functional class NYHA IV, evidence A. Its short half-life and instability in low pH environments necessitate continuous intravenous administration usually through an indwelling catheter (subclavian Hickman or equivalent) with an automatic ambulatory pump. The vast majority of side effects encountered (rash, flushing, jaw claudication, thrombocytopenia, hypotension) are either tolerable, abate over time, or reverse with decreasing doses.</p>
                                        <p>Although cumbersome, this single drug has, in many ways, revolutionized the treatment of PPH and has given hope to a large number of PPH patients who would otherwise have died while awaiting lung transplantation. In our experience, the majority of PPH patients (>90%) with advanced disease not only tolerates the drug but also has a markedly improved quality of life and survival [33,34].</p>
                                        <p>Other prostanoids, such as treprostenil, intravenous treprostenil, and iloprost, were studied. Treprostenil was suggested for PPH patients with NYHA functional class II, III, and IV and was shown to improve exercise endurance as measured by 6MWT distance; however, its effects were dose related, and the necessity of administering the medication subcutaneously by infusion may be a limitation. Recently, the use of intravenous treprostinil showed a longer half-life compared to intravenous epoprostenol. In addition, there were modest improvements in haemodynamics and exercise endurance as measured by 6MWT, and the final dose was more than twice the dose of epoprostenol used at the start of the study. This treatment was suggested for PPH patients in NYHA functional class II, III, and IV in whom subcutaneous infusion is not tolerated.</p>
                                        <p>Finally, iloprost via inhalation six to nine times per day appeared to improve by $10\%$ the exercise endurance in the 6MWT distance and NHYA functional class in the absence of clinical deterioration or death. By contrast, long-term data regarding inhaled iloprost are conflicting. Iloprost is advised for the PPH patients in NYHA functional class III, IV with evidence A and B, respectively.</p>

                                        <p>As described in Chapter 2, the effects of endothelin are mediated by the receptors endothelin (ET)${}_{\text{A}}$ and ET${}_{\text{B}}$ and include vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis, and/or abnormal cells proliferations, these processes are associated with remodeling and mediate pathological conditions, including PAH, pulmonary fibrosis, connective tissue diseases, and heart failure. On the basis of these encouraging discoveries, the authors of a large Randomized trial of Endothelin Antagonist THErapy (BREATHE-1) with Bosentan, an orally active dual (ET and ET${}_{\text{B}}$) endothelin-receptor antagonist, enrolled 213 patients suffering from PPH or PAH related to connective tissue disease.</p>
                                        <p>Significant benefits in exercise capacity, Borg dyspnoea index, NYHA functional class, and improvement in cardiac haemodynamics and heart chamber remodeling were revealed by bosentan therapy, which also reduced the time to clinical worsening compared with placebo ($p=0.002$) [35]. The clinical efficacy of bosentan has been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials in different patient populations and also in paediatric patients. In children with PPH and PAH associated with congenital heart disease or connective tissue disease, the Kaplan-Meier survival estimates at 1 year and 2 years were $98\%$ and $91\%$, respectively, and PAPm and other PVR parameters decreased. In this study, children were treated with bosentan with or without concomitant intravenous epoprostenol or subcutaneous trepostinil. The median treatment with bosentan was 14 months. The NYHA functional class improved in $46\%$ of the patients treated with bosentan [36].</p>
                                        <p>A confirmation of the improvements in haemdodynamics parameter was showed in a multicenter double blind randomized and placebo-controlled study in patients with NYHA functional class III Einsenmenger syndrome (Bosentan Randomized Trial of Endothelin Antagonist Therapy for Pulmonary Hypertension-5) [37]. Moreover, in a randomized trial of 30 patients treated with epoprostenol (BREATHE-2), the addition of bosentan was well tolerated and resulted in greater improvements in haemodynamics than epoprostenol alone [38]. However, the ACCP guidelines for patients with PAH suggest that until additional evidence becomes available, combination therapy might be considered in the context of clinical trials [26]. The limitations of therapy may be the risk of abnormal hepatic function test findings, syncope, and flushing. Bosentan therapy was suggested for NYHA functional class III and IV PAH (Evidence A and B, respectively).</p>
                                        <p>Recently, sitaxsentan, another oral endothelin A receptor selective antagonist, has been introduced. It has been used in patients with PAH at a dose of 100 mg once daily significantly, improving patients' 6MWT distance compared with placebo and was at least as effective as the use of twice-daily bosentan. Patients treated with sitaxsentan 100 mg experienced a $3\%$ incidence of hepatic enzyme elevation in comparison with the Bosentan group, which had an $11\%$ incidence [39].</p>

                                        <p>All Class III patients younger than 50 years of age are referred for transplant evaluation as part of the multidisciplinary approach for assessment and management. We rely on symptoms, physical examination with emphasis on estimated CVP, the presence of hepatomegaly and oedema, the echo Doppler RVSP and RV function, and distance walked in a 6-minute standard test at 6-month intervals to measure progress and need for further interventions. Because the waiting list for lung transplant is approximately 18 months and clinical deterioration may be rapid, it is imperative to monitor patients closely.</p>
                                        <p>Combined heart-lung, double-lung, and single-lung transplantation have each been performed in PPH. Because of the limited availability of donors and reports of comparable (albeit relatively poor when compared to other diseases requiring lung transplantation) results, some feel single lung transplantation is acceptable [42]. The complications after single-lung transplantation for PPH are aggravated by the disparity between pulmonary flow, which is high in the transplanted lung, and minute ventilation, which is shared equally between the two lungs. Our institution and many others consider bilateral transplantation the preferred option. Operative survival for lung transplantation for PPH is more than $90\%$. However, the 1 - and 5-year survival is relatively poor at $85\%$ and $50\%$. Most transplant survivors are in NYHA class I or II. Actual survival is reported from US Scientific Registry and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Registry [43,44]. Survival rates from ISHLT registry are presented in Table 5.4. No clearly significant difference in survival has been apparent among the procedures (single or bilateral lung transplantation, and heart-lung transplantation) in the ISHLT Registry.</p>

                                <p>PH from all aetiologies can lead to in situ thrombosis and obliteration of the pulmonary vasculature, which makes the differentiation between PPH and chronic thromboembolic PH difficult. We and others treating a large number of patients with PH have encountered patients in whom the diagnosis remains unclear despite pulmonary angiography and open lung biopsy. One or more episodes of small pulmonary emboli may precipitate a rapidly progressive form of pulmonary vasculopathy, which is further aggravated by in situ thrombi appearing late in its course as PPH. Patients with biopsy-proven PPH have been shown to have large in situ thrombi.</p>
                                <p>Thrombotic PH is one of many variant forms of PPH triggered by disease states, which alone do not result in PH and are labelled PPH variants. Others include atrial septal defects (a high flow shunt should not cause severe PH), collagen diseases such as lupus, mild mitral stenosis, and milder forms of lung disease with mild to moderate hypoxemia such as sleep apnoea and restrictive lung disease accompanying obesity.</p>

                                <p>PPH presents a challenge to practicing physicians both in diagnosis and assessment. A high index of suspicion in patients exposed to anorectics and a careful examination in patients with dyspnoea and fatigue should prompt the use of the echo Doppler to screen for pulmonary hypertension. The burden on the practitioner is heavy considering how common the complaints of fatigue and dyspnoea are in the outpatient setting.</p>
                                <p>The discovery of prostanoids and endothelin antagonist especially as an effective treatment has revolutionized the approach to patients with PPH. The physician's role has changed from providing emotional support and 'hand-holding' for the dieing patient to that of chronic disease assessment.</p>
