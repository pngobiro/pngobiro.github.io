                        <p>Connective tissue diseases (CTDs) remain among the most difficult causes of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) to correctly diagnose and treat. Part of the difficulty occurs because the symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and exercise limitation are common to all of the ILDs. Therefore, consideration of other factors that define the systemic illness becomes important. Unfortunately, CTDs can involve every organ in the body; therefore, a working knowledge of all of internal medicine becomes important in this set of diseases.</p>
                        <p>All of the CTDs are characterized by evidence of vascular injury, autoimmunity, tissue inflammation, and organ dysfunction. Some of these diseases have more inflammatory vascular disease than others. In this chapter, we will discuss the CTDs that have prominent pulmonary presentations, and separately discuss the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopic polyangiitis. A comprehensive discussion of the lung vasculature is not included in this chapter.</p>

                        <p>Many of the CTD have pulmonary presentations. The lungs may be the primary site of initial clinical symptoms, may have an occult involvement at any time during the disease process, and may develop symptomatic pathology after many years. The pulmonary presentations are distinct to each individual CTD. Therefore, this chapter will discuss the pulmonary manifestations within the context of the diseases. Although ILD is common to all of the diseases, a working knowledge of the other causes of dyspnea becomes important to understand when following an individual patient who is not responding well to therapy.</p>
                        
                        <!-- START: rheumatoid-arthritis -->
                        <section id="rheumatoid-arthritis" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="subsection-heading-rheumatoid-arthritis">
                            <h3 id="subsection-heading-rheumatoid-arthritis" class="subsection-heading">Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)</h3>
                            <div class="content-card">
                                <p>The most common ILD associated with CTD occurs with RA. RA affects up to $1\%$ of the population and is three times more common in women than in men; the peak age of onset is in the third to fifth decades of life but can occur at any age. The hallmark presentation is symmetrical polyarthritis of unknown etiology. The diagnosis of RA is established by the American College of Rheumatology criteria (Table 8.1) [1]. The majority of extra-articular manifestations of RA occur in a population of rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-cyclic citullinated peptide (anti-CCP) positive patients.</p>
                                <p>One of the more recent diagnostic tests for RA is a serum assay for anti-CCP. This antibody recognizes a binding domain on citrullinated extracellular fibrin on the rheumatoid synovium, and current research has defined a pathogenic role of this protein in RA [2]. Anti-CCP appears to have a marginally greater sensitivity and specificity for RA than RF and, thus, may supplant or supplement serum testing.</p>
                                <p>The prevalence of interstitial lung disease in RA is dependent on the diagnostic test administered to search for the disease. Pathologically, open lung biopsies have shown usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) in the majority of cases [3]. Because UIP is also the pathology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a clinical joint evaluation is appropriate in all patients with IPF.</p>
                                <p>Pulmonary fibrosis can be the presenting manifestation of RA. Joint disease can be clinically silent for up to 2 years while the disease progresses. Furthermore, the diagnosis of RA is complicated by the nonspecific nature of RF, because this assay is above the upper limits of normal in $36\%$ of patients with IPF [4]. Therefore, IPF patients with a positive RF should receive further testing to include hand and feet radiographs, as well as anti-CCP antibody titers.</p>
                                <p>The ILD of RA should be distinguished from rheumatoid nodules. Rheumatoid nodules in the lung are often multiple and can occur as a myriad of small ill defined infiltrates on the chest computed tomography [5]. Rheumatoid nodules usually grow when rheumatoid disease activity is active. Growth is suppressed, and most nodules regress to some degree on adequate levels of disease modifying drugs. However, therapy with methotrexate does not always cause regression of rheumatoid nodules [6]. Because RA is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, serial examination of nodules should define that these regress at the same degree. The possibility of lung cancer should be entertained when one nodule grows while others regress in size.</p>
                                <p>Other pulmonary manifestations of RA (Table 8.2) include arthritis of the cricoarytenoid joint that causes upper airway obstruction from bilateral vocal cord paresis, pleural effusions, airways disease, organizing pneumonia, and acute presentations of diffuse alveolar damage [7]. In addition, the toxicity of medications such as methotrexate should be considered. Pleural effusions are neutrophilic exudates with a characteristically low glucose and pH . These can lead to trapped lung, a condition in which the pleura is thickened and inelastic, leading to dyspnea from inadequate lung excursion.</p>
                                <p>Airway diseases associated with RA remain among the most difficult manifestations to accurately diagnose and treat. Pathologically, an inflammatory infiltrate of small airway walls can lead to airway narrowing, air trapping, and small airway closure (bronchiolitis obliterans). More proximal airways can become injured, resulting in bronchiolectasis or bronchiectasis that subsequently may become colonized with unusual pathogens. In the setting of immunosuppressants for RA, these airway pathogens may become a source of symptoms. An organizing pneumonia may be present with the organizing airways disease that defines the disease bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. When this disease is idiopathic, the terminology changes to cryptogenic organizing pneumonia [8].</p>
                                <p>Rarely, a more acute presentation of RA may involve the lung. These individuals present with the abrupt onset of fever and dyspnea, diffuse alveolar infiltrates on radiography, and hypoxemia. The pathology of this presentation is diffuse alveolar damage [9], the same pathology as seen in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This syndrome may be subtly different from ARDS on biopsy with a more active vascular inflammatory infiltrate that helps define this as a variant of rheumatoid vasculitis.</p>
                                <p>To date, there is no randomized study that proves that treatment of the lung disease independent of the activity of joint disease leads to improved pulmonary outcomes. However, because lung disease can precede and cause more symptoms than joint disease when present, many physicians will transition patients to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors, which are the most effective disease-modifying drugs when RA lung manifestations are present. Successful treatment of ILD has been reported with corticosteroids, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine [10], cyclophosphamide, and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. It remains unknown whether any aspects of UIP improve; however, inflammatory lesions in the lungs of RA patients with progressive lung disease may improve. Therefore, the typical response of aggressive therapy for RA ILD is stabilization of lung function decline, regression of any lung nodules present, improved joint symptoms and exercise tolerance, and improved quality of life. Although a nonspecific test, the Westergren sedimentation rate is used by some practitioners to follow rheumatoid disease activity.</p>

                            <h3 id="subsection-heading-systemic-sclerosis" class="subsection-heading">Systemic Sclerosis (SSc)</h3>
                            <div class="content-card">
                                <p>SSc is a CTD characterized by abnormalities of the skin (scleroderma). The American College of Rheumatology provides a case definition and subset differentiation on skin findings that include a diffuse cutaneous variant and a limited cutaneous (CREST) variant (Table 8.3). However, the excess mortality in this disease is defined by systemic organ involvement that often causes dyspnea from pulmonary or cardiac involvement.</p>
                                <p>SSc is a rare disease with an incidence of 1-2 cases per 100,000 individuals yearly and a US prevalence of 26 cases per 100,000 population [11]. A female predominance of 6-8:1 is similar to other CTD, although men who are affected tend to experience more severe disease. Raynaud's phenomenon is almost universal and is usually the first symptom of disease.</p>
                                <p>The pathogenesis of SSc remains unknown and is the focus of active research. Pathologic studies have documented proliferative and obliterative vascular change, particularly of small blood vessels as part of disease pathogenesis. The most obvious clinical disease apparent to a pulmonary clinician is pulmonary arterial hypertension, although the extent that abnormal vascular disease leads to the changes in esophageal dysmotility, pulmonary fibrosis, renal vascular disease, and cardiac and skin fibrosis remains unknown.</p>
                                <p>Autoimmunity is likely important in disease pathogenesis. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are positive in >95% of patients and is often in high titer. Antibodies associated with topoisomerase (Scl-70), as well as a variety of other antigens have been described. Scl-70 antibodies, although present in a minority of diffuse cutaneous SSc patients are associated with the presence of lung disease [12].</p>
                                <p>Genetic factors have been implicated in disease pathogenesis. HLA alleles are among the most common risk factors, although different ethnic populations have different alleles that place them at risk. In short, the strongest risk factor for the development of SSc is a family history of SSc, although the absolute risk for any family member remains quite low [11]. The role of abnormal collagen deposition from the myofibroblast, a cell with smooth muscle and fibroblast features, is in active study. These cells found in skin and lung have dysregulated collagen turnover.</p>
                                <p>Pulmonary involvement is common in SSc, with approximately equal distribution of pulmonary hypertension and ILD. The authors of some series suggest that ILD is present in $60\%$ of SSc patients at presentation and in $80\%$ of SSc patients when followed serially [13]. The type of ILD is pathologically nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) more commonly than UIP [14]. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the lung often defines the extent of disease and can be graded as limited ILD ($<10\%$ of the lung involved) and extensive ILD ($>30\%$ of the lung involved), since the group of patients with extensive disease is most likely to progress [15]. Spirometry is also useful to grade the severity of disease showing restriction. A forced vital capacity (FVC) $<70\%$ suggests a patient is at risk of further ILD progression [16].</p>
                                <p>Rarely, lung disease can occur before the development of other systemic manifestations of disease. "SSc sine scleroderma" is defined by manifestations of organ involvement prior to skin thickening [17]. Therefore, an appropriate screening for connective tissue disease in an ILD evaluation requires a complete review of systems focusing on skin, joint and esophageal symptoms.</p>
                                <p>Much work has focused on whether biomarkers, bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity, or specific HRCT patterns such as ground glass opacity make a difference in disease progression. Some biomarkers hold promise in lung disease diagnosis. Serum levels of surfactant proteins A and D are increased in SSc patients with lung disease. KL-6, a mucin-like glycoprotein expressed on type II pneumocytes also is increased in individuals with ILD. Whether these biomarkers define a therapy responsive population remains to be determined.</p>
                                <p>Recent large studies have suggested that HRCT fibrosis but not ground glass opacity or the BAL characteristics are helpful in defining a population who will subsequently progress or respond to specific therapy for ILD [15]. The ILD is typically subpleural in a circumferential pattern beginning in the lower lobes. Ground glass opacity, particularly if associated with traction bronchiectasis, suggests a fibrotic area of the lung parenchyma. However, it is the reticular extent of disease that is most associated with functional impairment [18].</p>
                                <p>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been used to assess the cellularity of the lower airways in SSc ILD finding that abnormal polymorphonuclear leukocyte percentages >3% and/or eosinophil percentages >2% are associated with more advanced disease [19]. Whether BAL cellularity predicts the subsequent ILD course remains much less clear. Although patients with excess BAL cellularity appeared more likely to respond to cyclophosphamide in some studies, a larger prospective randomized study failed to show that difference [20]. Because HRCT is easier to obtain than BAL, subsequent staging systems for the extent of ILD will not likely use BAL [16].</p>
                                <p>Treatment of SSc ILD remains controversial. The Scleroderma Lung Study was a large randomized controlled trial comparing cyclophosphamide to placebo in SSc ILD of onset <7 years from the first non-Raynaud's manifestation. The baseline adjusted FVC declined less in 1 year in the oral cyclophosphamide arm compared with placebo, although the absolute difference of FVC decline was within the minimal clinically significant change for FVC. Associated improvements in dyspnea, skin scores, and quality of life were also seen at the endpoint of 1 year [15]. Unfortunately, after stopping cyclophosphamide at 1 year, the benefits were not sustained at 24 months [21]. A study with similar design using intravenous cyclophosphamide produced similar results [22].</p>
                                <p>Other drugs have been tried without efficacy in SSc. The most promising drug for being a less toxic alternative to cyclophosphamide is mycophenolate mofetil. Numerous case series have been performed, with sometimes dramatic improvement found in HRCT and FVC results [23,24]. Prospective randomized studies are pending.</p>
                                <p>Although severe esophageal dysmotility is common in patients with SSc, the impact of aspiration on lung disease is confirmed in a minority of patients. The severity of lung disease does not correlate closely with the severity of esophageal disease, as measured by the propensity for reflux [25]. However, most patients should be treated with proton pump inhibitors for life to avoid the complications of chronic acid reflux, including Barrett's esophagus and malignancy.</p>
                                <p>Lung cancer occurs with increased frequency in patients with SSc, and any nodules should be aggressively managed because there is not a nodular form of SSc in the thorax. Organizing pneumonia is occasionally observed; this will often respond to corticosteroid therapy. However, corticosteroids are associated with increased incidence of SSc renal crisis. Whether the corticosteroid risk still holds with concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment has not been assessed. Finally, a rare obstructive lung disease has been noted.</p>
                                <p>Pulmonary vascular abnormalities in the absence of ILD may occur in up to $30\%$ of patients with limited cutaneous scleroderma (CREST variant). The pulmonary vascular disease is characterised by medial and intimal proliferation with vascular dropout when the vascular lumen is small [26]. Plexiform lesions can be seen. This form of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) accounts for up to $50\%$ of the cases of PAH seen in some referral centers.</p>
                                <p>A more complicated disease occurs when pulmonary hypertension is associated with ILD or smoking-related emphysema. In these conditions, some of the loss of vasculature is caused by the absence of functional vessels, whereas other patients may have some element of hypoxemia associated vasoconstriction. Therapy in these cases requires careful treatment to assure that worsened ventilation perfusion matching does not occur if pulmonary vasodilators are given [27]. Prostacyclins, endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been successful in improving functional capacity and mortality in SSc PAH.</p>
                                <p>One of the consequences of treatment for pulmonary hypertension is the possibility of pulmonary oedema. Veno-occlusive disease and capillary hemangiomatosis have both been reported in patients with scleroderma [28]. However, fibrosis of the heart is also a common finding in patients presenting with this disease [29]. Unrecognized diastolic dysfunction may produce dyspnea, pulmonary hypertension, and right heart failure. Cardiac catheterization is necessary to define proper therapy in the majority of patients.</p>
                                <p>Pleural disease is uncommon in SSc occurring in $<10\%$ of patients over the lifetime of disease [30]. Overlap syndromes with other features suggestive of SLE are seen in some individuals. Pleural and pericardial effusions are occasionally large enough that drainage will improve outcome. Pneumothorax is seen rarely in ILD.</p>
                                <p>Bronchogenic carcinoma and other cancers are increased in frequency in SSc and frequently occur in nonsmokers. Because SSc does not have a nodular clinical presentation, diagnostic work for opportunistic infections or cancer should occur for most lung nodules.</p>
                                <p>Gastrointestinal involvement in patients with SSc is nearly universal. Esophageal dysmotility can lead to aspiration, although most studies suggest that aspiration does not influence the incidence or severity of ILD. Nevertheless, pulmonary infections are increased in studies in which the authors use BAL and failure to thrive may occasionally be improved by the administration of antibiotics for occult pulmonary infection. Abdominal distention can impact lung function and is sometimes improved with promotility agents because the small bowel is also affected with a dysmotility syndrome. Bacterial overgrowth, alternating diarrhea and constipation, and bloating are sometimes improved by courses of nonabsorbable antibiotics that limit bacterial overgrowth. Another treatable condition that can contribute to dyspnea is an inflammatory myositis that can occur in overlap from polymyositis/ dermatomyositis (PM/DM) or independently. Muscle weakness is improved with small doses of corticosteroids.</p>

                            <div class="content-card">
                                <p>The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are a group of diseases that are characterized by muscle injury on biopsy and variable degrees of autoantibody production. Some of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies such as inclusion body myositis do not have associated lung disease. However, the most common of these diseases, polymyositis, is an autoimmune disease that often involves the lung. When associated with skin disease, this disease is called dermatomyositis. A rare form of amyopathic dermatomyositis may exist in which the classic skin presentation does not have clinical or laboratory evidence of muscle injury present. Therefore, for purposes of this review, polymyositis and dermatomyositis (i.e., PM/DM) in all of its forms will be discussed as a single disease.</p>
                                <p>PM/DM is still diagnosed by the classic criteria of Peters and Bohm (Table 8.4), although other diagnostic criteria are being evaluated that involve improved use of the many new autoantibodies found in this idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (Table 8.5). Unfortunately, many of the acute clinical pulmonary presentations reviewed below will not meet classic diagnostic criteria. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed when clinical weakness is part of a pulmonary presentation with an undiagnosed diffuse lung disease.</p>
                                <p>In characterising the autoantibodies involved with muscle injury, a group of antibodies against transfer RNA synthetases were found. The first of these with clinical importance was named Jo-1. The Jo-1 antibody-associated antisynthetase syndrome was described as a subgroup of PM/DM with a high incidence of associated lung injury. Subsequently, other antibodies have been described that can be obtained from many laboratories in the form of myositis antibody panels.</p>
                                <p>The clinical presentation of patients with PM/DM is heterogeneous. Muscle weakness is a consistent feature of disease, but often it is discounted with a more prominent pulmonary presentation. Muscle weakness occurs in all striated muscle and therefore may occur in pharyngeal and upper esophageal musculature, which may complicate the risk of aspiration-associated lung disease. Diaphragmatic dysfunction may also occur from muscle weakness.</p>
                                <p>A common DM/PM presentation occurs when a patient is in the intensive care unit. Some case series suggest that up to $50\%$ of patients may present with an acute to subacute presentation that clinically is similar to ARDS. The pathology of that presentation is diffuse alveolar damage, and no comparative treatment trials have been performed. Patients usually have a history of arthralgias and weakness that can be easily overlooked given the severity of pulmonary disease. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids is associated with improvement that is sufficient enough to recover from acute respiratory failure in half of affected individuals. Most survivors have severe residual impairment of lung function.</p>

                                <p>SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease with the capacity to affect every organ system in the body. The etiology is unknown, although hormonal, racial, genetic, and environmental factors have been implicated. SLE is primarily a disease of young women, with a female-to-male ratio of 9:1. Black and Hispanic subjects are affected more commonly than are white subjects; the prevalence varies worldwide and is approximately 1 case per 2,000 people in the USA. Antinuclear antibodies are present in the serum of virtually every patient with SLE, whereas antibodies to the Smith antigen and double-stranded DNA are more specific for the diagnosis. Classification criteria have been established by the American College of Radiology (Table 8.6); the presence of 4 of the 11 criteria is sufficient to establish the diagnosis.</p>

                                <p>Pleuritis is the most common pulmonary manifestation in SLE, and occurs at some point in the disease course in approximately $50\%$ of patients. Autopsy studies have shown the presence of pleural effusions in about two-thirds of patients [31]. The pathogenesis of pleural effusions in SLE is likely immune complex deposition, as low concentrations of complement and evidence of complement fixation are present in the pleural fluid [32]. Pleural fluid analysis shows an exudative effusion. The presence of LE cells is diagnostic of SLE, but this test is now largely obsolete. ANAs are commonly found in pleural fluid, but are not specific for SLE and need not be routinely obtained [33]. The treatment of pleuritis in SLE includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids (usually no more than 10 to 20 mg of prednisone equivalent daily); hydroxychloroquine is effective for long-term treatment.</p>
                                <p>Acute lupus pneumonitis is an uncommon pulmonary manifestation of SLE, with a prevalence of $<10\%$ [34]. The typical presentation is an acute onset of fever, cough, and dyspnea; diffuse alveolar infiltrates are seen on chest radiographs. An infectious process must be excluded. Acute lupus pneumonitis is often observed in the setting of other manifestations of active lupus and hence concomitant immunosuppression is common. BAL may be useful in this regard and may also help differentiate acute lupus pneumonitis from alveolar hemorrhage. The lavage fluid in pneumonitis shows increased numbers of red blood cells but not frankly hemorrhagic fluid [35]. The prognosis in patients is poor, with mortality rates approaching $50\%$ [36]. Treatment includes high doses of corticosteroids; in addition, concomitant therapy with azathioprine or cyclophosphamide should be considered [37].</p>
                                <p>The shrinking lung syndrome is a rare complication of SLE characterised by progressive dyspnea, decreased lung volumes, and often a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing. The prevalence of this condition is uncertain, and has been reported to be rare ( 49 reported cases) [38] to fairly common ($23\%$ in one series.) [39]. The underlying pathogenesis is likewise not well defined; diaphragmatic myopathy, myositis, and muscle fibrosis as well as phrenic nerve lesions have all been implicated. Treatment of this condition includes moderate to high (30-60 mg of prednisone daily) doses of corticosteroids, theophylline, $\beta$-agonists, or immunosuppressive agents [40].</p>
                                <p>Alveolar hemorrhage is an abrupt and potentially devastating consequence of SLE. In one large case series, the prevalence was $3.7\%$ for all hospital admissions related to SLE, with a mortality rate of $53\%$ [41]. An acute presentation with cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis is most common, although the absence of hemoptysis does not exclude the diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show anemia, and diffuse alveolar infiltrates are seen on chest radiography. BAL with return of bloody lavage fluid is diagnostic; cultures should be obtained to rule out infection as an inciting event. The pathogenesis is uncertain but likely involves pulmonary capillaritis. No randomized trials are available to guide therapy. Clinical experience suggests the most effective therapy is plasmapheresis combined with pulse-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide [42].</p>
                                <p>Chronic interstitial lung disease is uncommon in SLE as compared with that encountered in RA, SSc, and PM/DM, although the clinical presentation is similar. The prevalence of chronic ILD has been reported to be from $3\%$ to $8\%$ in various studies [34], and its management is similar to that of ILD in other CTDs.</p>
                                <p>Pulmonary hypertension occurs in up to $14\%$ of patients with SLE, and the clinical characteristics are similar to those in idiopathic PAH. However, the prognosis is significantly worse in SLE-associated pulmonary hypertension, with 5-year survival rates as low as $16.8\%$ [43]. Its management is similar to that of idiopathic PAH.</p>

                                <p>SS is an autoimmune disorder characterised by a lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands. The hallmark of this disorder is the sicca complex, characterised by dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca or xerophthalmia) and dry mouth (xerostomia.) However, extraglandular organs are also involved, and the disease has the capacity to affect multiple organ systems. SS may occur as a primary autoimmune disorder (primary SS or Sjögren disease) or as a constellation of symptoms associated with another autoimmune disorder such as RA, SLE, PM/DM, or SSc (secondary SS).</p>
                                <p>A wide variation in the frequency of respiratory tract involvement in SS has been reported; ranging from $9\%$ to $75\%$ [44]. The clinical spectrum of pulmonary tract involvement in SS ranges from xerotrachea (often resulting in a chronic cough) to bronchiolar disease, interstitial pneumonitis, ILD, and lymphoma.</p>
                                <p>Lymphocytic bronchiolitis is frequently present and may progress to a lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) [45]. The association of LIP and SS is well established with SS associated with $25\%$ of the reported cases of LIP [46]. Lung cysts are a common finding in patients with LIP [47]; other pulmonary findings include ground glass opacities, centrilobular nodules, interstitial thickening, and lymphadenopathy [48].</p>
                                <p>In addition to LIP, a wide variety of histologic findings has been described in SS-associated ILD. NSIP has been reported to be the most common histologic subtype [49]. NSIP, organizing pneumonia, UIP, primary pulmonary lymphoma, and amyloidosis were each reported in one case series [44]. Lymphoma may be of the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue type [50]. Corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy is commonly used in the treatment of SS-associated ILD, but optimal treatment has yet to be defined.</p>

                                <p>WG is a systemic vasculitis with the capacity to affect virtually every organ system in the body; the respiratory tract and kidneys are most commonly involved. WG may occur at any age, and occurs with equal frequency in men and women. The pathologic hallmark is a granulomatous vasculitis of small and medium arteries, although venules and large arteries may also be involved. Extravascular granulomatous inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tract is also frequently seen [51]. The pathogenesis of the disease is unknown, although a strong association with the presence of ANCAs is recognized. The finding of ANCA in other forms of systemic vasculitis, including microscopic polyangiitis [52] and Churg-Strauss syndrome, suggests the possibility of a pathologic role for these antibodies. As a result of this finding, these disease entities are often considered part of a clinical spectrum of ANCA-associated vasculitides [53].</p>
                                <p>The presenting manifestations of WG are protean and commonly include constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Ocular, skin, and musculoskeletal manifestations are frequently encountered [54]. Up to $80\%$ of patients will develop renal disease at some point in the disease course [51] A somewhat-artificial differentiation between "limited" WG (i.e., involving only the upper respiratory tract) and "diffuse" WG is often described. However, whether there are actual phenotypic differences in the limited and diffuse forms of WG is not well understood [55]. A predominance of pulmonary findings is a common presentation of WG [56]. Clinical manifestations of WG involving the respiratory tract include tracheal stenosis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary nodules (solitary or multiple), cavitary lesions, and interstitial lung disease [57].</p>
                                <p>In the clinical setting of a pulmonary vasculitis, the diagnosis of WG is suggested by the presence of circulating ANCA. Virtually all patients with active WG have ANCA [58], but it remains unclear as to whether the presence of ANCA is a marker for disease activity [59]. In WG, ANCA are most commonly of the cytoplasmic staining pattern (c-ANCA); this is usually due to antibodies directed against proteinase-3 (anti PR-3) [53].</p>
                                <p>Aggressive therapy is indicated in the treatment of WG; a $90\%$ mortality rate at 2 years is found in patients with untreated diffuse WG, most often the result of pulmonary disease or renal failure. The combination of oral cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids to induce remission is the best-studied regimen [51]. A regimen of induction of remission with cyclophosphamide and maintenance of remission with azathioprine has been described and may have less toxic side effects [60]. Treatment with the tumour necrosis factor inhibitor etanercept was not effective in one trial and may have been associated with increased morbidity [61]. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against CD-20, has been reported to be effective in the management of refractory WG [62]. In general, limited WG carries a more favorable prognosis, and therapy might be include the use of less toxic immunosuppressants such as methotrexate, azathioprine, and/or corticosteroids [63].</p>

                                <p>MPA [52] is an ANCA-associated vasculitis affecting small vessels (capillaries, venules, arterioles). Histopathologically, a necrotizing vasculitis without immune complex deposition is seen. Similar to WG, the pathogenesis of MPA is unknown, although a strong association with ANCA is also found. Unlike WG, granuloma formation or granulomatous vasculitis are not features of MPA.</p>
                                <p>The presenting manifestations of MPA are not as varied as those seen in WG. Constitutional symptoms are quite common, and a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is seen in the vast majority of patients. Pulmonary manifestations, most commonly diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, are seen in approximately $25\%$ of patients. Skin, joint, and neurologic findings are frequently seen [64].</p>
                                <p>Like WG, ANCA are a central feature of the diagnosis of MPA. In the latter, ANCA usually present with a perinuclear staining pattern (p-ANCA) indicating the presence of antibodies to myeloperoxidase (anti-MPO.) The presence of p-ANCA and anti-MPO in MPA are not as sensitive or specific as are c-ANCA and antiPR-3 [65]. ANCA have been reported to have a direct pathologic role in the pathogenesis of MPA [66]. In general, the therapy of MPA mirrors that of WG. A "limited" form such as has been described in WG is not usually seen in MPA. Aggressive corticosteroid therapy, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and plasma exchange therapy have all been used in the treatment of MPA [67].</p>
