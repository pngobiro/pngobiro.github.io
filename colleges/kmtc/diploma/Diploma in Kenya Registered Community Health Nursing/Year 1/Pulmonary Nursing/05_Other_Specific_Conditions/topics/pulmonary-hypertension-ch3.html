                        <p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) accounts for the majority of cases of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) and carries a poor prognosis for the patient. Although the term, IPF, was once used for a number of forms of IIP, IPF is now defined as a specific disease entity. IPF is characterized by radiological and/or histopathological patterns of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) on surgical lung biopsy or a constellation of clinical criteria that predict a confident diagnosis of IPF in the absence of a surgical lung biopsy [1,2]. When the diagnosis of IPF is made, it infers that patients lack other explanations for the presence of a UIP lesion, such as an associated connective tissue disorder or an iatrogenic/environmental exposure that can cause pulmonary fibrosis with a histopathological pattern suggestive of UIP.</p>
                        <p>The diagnosis of IPF is often made relatively late in the course of the disease, when patients have fairly impaired lung function. IPF has proven to be generally refractory to immunosuppressive therapies [3], and the authors of less-recent studies who suggested that a beneficial response to immunosuppressive therapy may occur were likely to have included some patients with non-IPF forms of IIP. Other forms of IIP, such as nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), can respond to immunosuppressive pharmacologic agents (e.g., corticosteroids, cytotoxic drugs). Pulmonary hypertension (PH) has been increasingly recognized as a complication of IPF and portends a much poorer prognosis for survival.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A relative lack of studies based on population screening combined with a lack of uniform diagnostic criteria have made it difficult to establish a reasonably accurate estimate of the incidence and prevalence of IPF because most of the available studies were performed before the current definition of IPF was adopted. Despite these problems, IPF has not been shown to have a biased expression on the basis of race or ethnic background, although men more frequently are affected than are women. Coultas et al. [4] reported the incidence and prevalence of IPF in the desert southwestern region of the USA as 11 and 20 per 100,000 per year, respectively, for men and 7 and 13 per 100,000 per year for women. A study from the UK in which the authors examined data from a longitudinal computerized general practice database estimated the incidence of IPF at 4.6 per 100,000 person-years and observed a progressive increase in the incidence for the periods of 1991-1995 to 2000-2003 [5].</p>
                        <p>A more recent study by Raghu et al. [6], using relatively narrow criteria (diagnostic code for IPF plus procedure code for lung biopsy, transbronchial biopsy, or thoracic computed tomography [CT] scan), found the incidence and prevalence of IPF in the USA as 6.8 and 14 per 100,000/year. If broader diagnostic criteria were used (diagnostic code only), the incidence and prevalence were 16.3 and 42.7 per 100,000/year. Both Coultas et al. [4] and Raghu et al. [6] found a dramatic increase in the incidence and prevalence of IPF with advancing age. Coultas et al. reported that the incidence and prevalence of IPF in persons ages 75 and older were 102 and 175 for men and 57 and 73 per 100,000 for women. Similarly, Raghu et al. estimated an incidence and prevalence of 71 and 271 per 100,000/year for elderly men and 67 and 266 per 100,000/yr for elderly women. In comparison, the incidence of IPF approaches that of primary lung cancer in the elderly [7], and the incidence of colorectal cancer is estimated at 15-18 per 100,000/year [8]. Increased death rates also have been reported recently throughout the USA [9].</p>
                        <p>A number of epidemiological studies have established risk factors for IPF. Individuals at increased risk include workers who are exposed to metal or wood dust, fumes, or livestock; men are more likely to have these types of exposures [10,11]. Cigarette smoking appears to be an independent risk factor in both sporadic and familial IPF [12], and viral infections, particularly Epstein-Barr virus infection, also have been linked to IPF pathogenesis [13]. Additionally gastroesophageal reflux disease has been strongly linked to IPF, with a prevalence of approximately $90\%$ in patients with IPF [14,15].</p>

                        <p>Pulmonary fibrosis is a manifestation of the disease state in various genetic disorders (Table 3.1), and numerous specific gene mutations and polymorphisms have been associated with IPF [16,17]. These associations indicate that genetic factors undoubtedly play a role in disease susceptibility, although gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interactions, and epigenetic factors undoubtedly influence susceptibility to pulmonary fibrosis, and multiple genetic polymorphisms may simultaneously play a role in the pathogenesis of IPF. Other observations that support a genetic predisposition to IPF include the differential responses that inbred mouse strains display to fibrogenic agents and the considerable variation in susceptibility to developing pneumoconioses that has been observed in humans exposed to fibrogenic dusts, such as asbestosis or silica, in the workplace. Additionally, factors that are inherent to advancing age may come into play and explain the greatly increased susceptibility of older individuals to pulmonary fibrosis. These factors include age-associated reduction in telomerase activity in human somatic cells [18], which can decrease the inhibitory effect of telomerase on the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts [19], or altered expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, which has been associated with fibrosis, by senescent fibroblasts [20].</p>

                        <p>Because the vast majority of patients develop pulmonary fibrosis in their sixth decade of life or beyond, telomerase mutations that are associated with adult-onset pulmonary fibrosis may be of particular interest. Telomerase antagonizes or reverses telomere shortening, and cultured cells exhibit replicative senescence as telomeres shorten. Additionally, telomeres are shorter in older versus younger individuals, and telomere shortening has been linked to human aging. Mutations in the reverse transcriptase protein component (hTERT) of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex have been linked to dyskeratosis congenita and sporadic bone marrow failure [21], and hTERT mutations have recently been linked to familial pulmonary fibrosis [22,23]. Cultured fibroblasts and other cell types from patients with IPF associated with telomerase complex gene mutations display reduced telomere lengths. However, hTERT mutations and telomere shortening occur in family members without pulmonary fibrosis, indicating that other factors (e.g., environmental effects, other genes) modulate clinical expression of disease.</p>
                        <p>Lung histopathology in UIP demonstrates areas of seemingly normal lung interspersed with fibrotic lesions that are characterised by temporal heterogeneity. Architectural distortion of the lung parenchyma typically is present, and other histopathologic findings that are characteristic of UIP include the presence of fibroblast foci (discrete collections of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and newly formed collagen), smooth muscle hyperplasia, and honeycomb cysts (dilated airspaces lined with bronchiolar epithelium and usually filled with inspissated mucus and inflammatory cells). Interestingly, when native lung explants were examined from patients with a pretransplant diagnosis of IPF, areas consistent with changes of NSIP as well as desquamative interstitial pneumonia were identified in nearly all explants [24]. Flaherty et al. [25] found that surgical lung biopsies from different lung regions in a given patient often show discordant histopathology, with one biopsy showing UIP but another showing NSIP. Survival was much better for patients with concordant NSIP/NSIP and worst for those with concordant UIP/UIP, while that for patients with UIP/NSIP was similar to that for UIP/UIP.</p>

                        <p>The pathogenesis of IPF involves features of wound healing and tissue remodeling, and abnormal wound healing may account for the progressive nature of the lung lesions and the inability to restore the lung to normal structure and function (Fig. 3.1). Increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that promote inflammation and fibroproliferation [26] support a role for inflammation and polarization of the immune response, even though conventional anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive therapies appear to have little effect on disease progression. Key cytokines implicated in promoting fibrosis include tumour necrosis factor (TGF)-$\beta$, interleukin-13, and CC chemokines [26]. Other abnormalities that have been identified include epithelial injury associated with apoptosis and loss of type I alveolar cells accompanied by a proliferation of type II cells and basement membrane disruption, and reactive oxygen intermediates are released as inflammatory cells are recruited to the lungs.</p>
                        <p>Another aspect of damage and remodeling of the lung parenchyma consists of microvascular changes that include evidence of endothelial cell death accompanied by recruitment of endothelial cells and fibroblasts, activation of the coagulation cascade, and deposition of excessive extracellular matrix. Turner-Warwick [27] described extensive microvascular remodeling that was characterised by neovascular changes in areas of fibrosis and in areas where anastomoses between systemic and pulmonary microvasculature were identified. Aberrant vascular remodeling has also been described in animal models of pulmonary fibrosis [28], and communications between the systemic and pulmonary microvasculature may promote right-to-left shunting and hypoxaemia in patients, especially during physical exertion. Additionally, more extensive microvascular changes may predispose patients to develop secondary PH and further exacerbate gas exchange in patients who develop this complication. Vascular remodeling in IPF has been associated with an imbalance of angiogenic and angiostatic CXC chemokines with net augmentation of angiogenic activity [29], but a relative lack of the potent angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor [30], as well as enhanced expression of angiostatic factors such as pigment epithelial-derived factor have also been described in IPF [31]. One interesting distinction between granulation tissue seen in organizing pneumonia and the fibroblast foci of UIP is a relative paucity of proangiogenic cytokines in the fibroblast foci of UIP [32].</p>

                        <p>Most patients present with progressive dyspnea, and many have cough. Most patients are in their sixth to eighth decade of life and tend to have relatively advanced disease and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings that are typical for IPF. Because UIP can be associated with certain exposures or various rheumatologic disorders, a detailed clinical history should be taken to help exclude environmental exposures associated with pulmonary fibrosis, to identify medications that can induce a pneumotaxic reaction, and to detect the presence of a collagen-vascular disorder. Physical examination usually reveals bilateral rales at the lung bases on chest auscultation, and many patients have digital clubbing. Patients typically have evidence of a restrictive ventilatory defect on pulmonary function testing and a reduction in the diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DL${}_{\text{CO}}$). Arterial hypoxaemia is usually present with advanced disease, and oxyhemoglobin desaturation can often be brought out by exertion when milder disease is present by performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing or a 6-minute walk test (6MWT).</p>
                        <p>Chest radiographs typically reveal bilateral interstitial opacities that are most prominent at the lung bases and in peripheral subpleural locations, but such changes can be seen with other forms of ILD, such as other forms of IIP, asbes-tosis, or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Occasionally, the routine chest radiograph may not reveal any significant abnormalities, and the disease is detected only when HRCT is performed. HRCT is a key tool for evaluating patients with diffuse parenchymal lung disease, and typical HRCT changes in UIP include a predilection for basilar and peripheral lung zones with patchy involvement and relative sparing of more central areas [33]. Linear opacities, which represent thickened intralobular and interlobular septae, are observed, and more advanced disease is characterised by honeycomb cysts (representing bronchiolectasis) and traction bronchiectasis. Ground-glass opacities should be minimal or absent, and the finding of prominent ground-glass opacities on HRCT would suggest an alternative diagnosis such as NSIP or COP.</p>

                        <p>Although bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial lung biopsy can provide useful information that establishes a diagnosis of a specific form of ILD or at least substantially narrows the differential diagnosis (Fig. 3.2), adequate sampling from two or more segments/lobes via a surgical lung biopsy (SLB) is required to characterise the histological pattern as UIP and thus make a definitive diagnosis of IPF in patients who have other features suggesting an alternative diagnosis for the ILD/IIP. BAL typically reveals a differential cell count that shows a modest increase in neutrophils and/or eosinophils in IPF [34]. The presence of a BAL cell lymphocytosis pattern or the finding of a marked increase in eosinophils would suggest an alternative diagnosis. Although transbronchial lung biopsies may occasionally show changes consistent with IPF [35], the likelihood of retrieving adequate alveolar tissue and the ability to characterise the histological pattern of UIP in transbronchial lung biopsy specimens seems very low.</p>
                        <p>However, bronchoscopy was incorporated into the 2000 expert consensus statement on making a clinical diagnosis of IPF (Table 3.2) in the absence of a surgical lung biopsy [2]. With increasing awareness of typical clinical features and of a classic HRCT pattern of UIP, the trend in accepting a diagnosis of IPF without the need for subjecting patients to bronchoscopy and/or confirmation of the UIP pattern via the SLB has become evident. However, in the presence of atypical clinical and/or HRCT features, especially in new-onset ILD, the diagnosis of IPF can only be ascertained by recognition of UIP pattern in the SLB [1]. When lung biopsies are performed, the likelihood of the accuracy of the diagnosis of IPF is greater when the clinician interacts with an experienced pathologist and radiologist familiar with ILD/IIP [36].</p>

                        <p>Median survival in IPF has been shown by various investigators to range between 2 and 5 years [37], and the survival of patients with IPF is clearly worse than that for patients with other forms of IIP such as cellular NSIP. However, survival varies according to various factors, such as age, extent of fibrosis, the presence of secondary hypertension, or other specific features of the clinical presentation. Flaherty et al. [38] found that patients who had an indeterminate HRCT combined with a surgical lung biopsy that showed UIP had a median survival of 5.8 years, whereas those with typical HRCT findings had a median survival of 2.1 years. One explanation for this considerable difference in survival may be that individuals with indeterminate HRCT findings were diagnosed earlier in the course of their disease. Interestingly, survival with collagen-vascular disease-associated UIP has been observed to be better than that for patients with idiopathic UIP/ IPF [39].</p>
                        <p>Various clinical findings and measures of lung function have been linked to disease progression and survival (Table 3.3), but the clinical course of IPF can be quite variable. Some patients can have sustained and relatively rapid decline in lung function that leads to respiratory failure, whereas others can have fairly stable and relatively gradual decline in lung function over long periods of time. The triggers for acute and/or rapid decline in respiratory status are unknown, and acute exacerbations can occur in patients who are otherwise stable and result in a precipitous decline and death [40,41]. Although the exact incidence and prevalence of acute exacerbation in IPF is unknown, it is apparent that such rapid decline may manifest in approximately $5-15\%$ of patients with IPF. A recent perspective by experts implicates occult infection, gastroesophageal reflux and microvascular coagulation as potential risks and/or causative factors [42].</p>
                        <p>Some of the most useful measures that correlate with disease severity/progression are subjective dyspnea, change in forced vital capacity over time, baseline DL${}_{\text{CO}}$ and change over time, and degree of oxyhemoglobin desaturation or change in walk distance during a 6MWT [43-47] or a modified 6MWT [48]. Individuals who have severe reduction in resting DL${}_{\text{CO}}$ are more likely to have secondary PH as a complication of their disease [49].</p>
                        <p>Although most patients succumb to respiratory complications of their disease, some die of causes other than respiratory failure, such as cardiac events or malignancy [50]. Pulmonary malignancy can occur, and patients with IPF are at increased risk of developing primary lung cancer, even when smoking is not a factor [51]. Patients with IPF are also at risk for pulmonary infection, venous thromboembolism, and adverse drug reactions.</p>

                        <p>It is clear that PH has an adverse effect on outcomes in chronic lung disease, and PH occurring as a complication of sarcoidosis has been identified as a marker for early death [52]. PH has also been identified as a frequent complication of IPF. Lettieri et al. [49] identified PH (defined as mean pulmonary artery pressure >25 mmHg) in $31.6\%$ of patients undergoing pretransplant evaluation with cardiac catheterization. Greater pressures correlated with increased risk of death, and patients with PH had a lower DL${}_{\text{CO}}$, lower walk distance, and greater oxyhemoglobin desaturation on a 6MWT, and were more likely to require supplemental oxygen therapy.</p>
                        <p>Nadrous et al. [53] found that echocardiographically estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure [sPAP] correlated inversely with DL${}_{\text{CO}}$, and patients with sPAP greater than 50 mmHg had a significantly worse survival than patients with milder PH. When a cohort of lung transplant candidates with IPF were re-evaluated with right heart catheterization just before undergoing lung transplant, the prevalence of PH increased from 33% to 85% of patients [54], suggesting that the risk of developing secondary PH gradually increases as lung function becomes progressively impaired. Additionally, examination of the United Network for Organ Sharing database identified PH in 46.1% of patients with IPF who had undergone right heart catheterization [55], and 6MWT distance was significantly lower in recently listed patients with IPF who had PH versus those who did not have PH [56]. Whelan et al. [57] identified increasing PAP as a risk factor for increased mortality after single lung transplant for IPF. Although it is conceivable that some patients may have occult PH at the time of onset/diagnosis, the incidence of this presentation is unknown.</p>
                        <p>Pathologic changes that affect the arteries, arterioles, capillary beds, and venules have been observed in IPF [27,58,59], and in situ thrombosis has been reported in small muscular pulmonary arteries [60]. Fibroblast and myofibroblast proliferation combined with deposition of extracellular matrix causes adventitial perivascular thickening, and pulmonary arterioles become muscularised and smooth muscle cell hypertrophy and proliferation combined with elastin and collagen accumulation occur in the media of small muscular arteries and distal pulmonary arterioles. Intimal hyperplasia combined with fibrosis and reduplication of the inner elastic laminae also occurs in small muscular arteries. Vascular regression appears to occur in areas of dense fibrosis and within fibroblast foci while increased capillary density combined with angiogenesis appears to occur in areas of seemingly normal lung flanking regions of dense fibrosis.</p>
                        <p>Altered expression of various pro- and anti-angiogenic cytokines and chemokines has been detected in lung tissue from patients with IPF [26], but it is unclear how these contribute to vascular remodeling and the development of PH. Vascular endothelial growth factor, which is highly expressed in the normal lung and likely plays an important role in maintenance of normal microvasculature by preventing endothelial cell apoptosis, is greatly reduced in the lung affected by UIP [30,31] and may contribute to depressed endothelial cell proliferation in response to injury (wound repair responses) and play a role in the destruction of capillary beds. Overall vessel density appears to be reduced in association with net vascular ablation [61], although an overall proangiogenic environment seems to exist with increased expression of angiogenic chemokines, such as CXCL5 and CXCL8, as opposed to angiostatic chemokines, such as CXCL10 [29,62,63]. Other mediators, such as endothelin-1 (ET-1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor (TGF-$\beta$), fibroblast growth factor, and serotonin display increased expression and may modulate changes in the media of pulmonary arteries. ET-1, a potent pulmonary vasoconstrictor and mitogen for smooth muscle cells, and other cytokines such as PDGF have been implicated in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, and mechanistic pathways that cause PH may be similar in patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (IPAH) and those with IPF who develop PH.</p>
                        <p>Symptoms of PH, such as dyspnea and palpitations, may be difficult to differentiate from symptoms of progressive parenchymal fibrosis. Patients may have a loud pulmonic valve closure sound (P${}_{2}$) on cardiac auscultation, or they may have a fixed, split S${}_{2}$, or a holosystolic murmur attributable to tricuspid regurgitation. An early diastolic murmur may occur when pulmonic valve insufficiency is present, and a right ventricular heave or jugular venous distension may be present. An electrocardiogram may show a pattern of right ventricular strain, and chest radiography may show right ventricular enlargement, pulmonary artery dilation, and cardiomegaly. A very low DL${}_{\text{CO}}$ and requirement for supplemental oxygen should increase suspicion that PH may be present. However, further diagnostic testing is generally needed.</p>
                        <p>Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can be useful as a screening modality to detect PH, but its reliability is somewhat problematic, and PAPs can be underestimated or overestimated with TTE. Furthermore, Arcasoy et al. [64] found that technical difficulties often limit the ability to estimate right heart pressures. Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) measurements were within 10 mmHg of sPAP from right heart catheterization (RHC) in only $37\%$ of subjects, $40\%$ of patients identified as having increased RVSP by TTE did not have PH by RHC (sPAP >45 mmHg), and $56\%$ of patients identified as having normal RVSP were found to have PH by RHC. Finally, more than $25\%$ of patients with normal RV morphology on TTE had PH when RHC was performed. Because of the limitations of TTE in accurately detecting and quantitating PH, a circulating biomarker that is predictive of PH would be clinically useful. Leuchte et al. [65] found plasma brain natriuretic peptide levels to be greater in patients with pulmonary fibrosis with mean PAP (mPAP) values >35 mmHg as compared with those with mPAP <35 mmHg.</p>
                        <p>Because of the shortcomings of clinical findings on physical examination and various measurements that reflect physiology and gas exchange (DL${}_{\text{CO}}$, resting oxyhemoglobin saturation, supplemental oxygen requirements, 6MWT desaturation or distance), direct measurement of right heart and pulmonary artery pressures are required for accurate diagnosis and quantitation of severity of PH. Unfortunately, TTE lacks the accuracy of RHC, and the role of brain natriuretic peptide measurement as a screening tool remains unclear, leaving RHC as the best diagnostic procedure currently available for detecting and quantitating PH in patients with IPF.</p>
                        <p>Pulmonary vascular remodeling and the resultant PH as a complication of IPF clearly have a negative impact on the clinical status and survival of patients with IPF. A lower quality of life and a greater degree of exercise limitation characterise patients with IPF-associated PH, and circulatory impairment associated with PH appears to be independent of ventilatory compromise and have a greater impact on gas exchange and exercise limitation than ventilatory impairment [56,66]. Numerous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of death in patients with PH , and patients with PH who were listed for lung transplantation and had a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ($\leq 15 \text{mmHg}$) were found to have a 3-fold increased risk of death that was independent of age, race, percent predicted forced vital capacity, or 6MWT distance [56].</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>It has become clear that anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive pharmacologic therapies have had relatively little efficacy in the treatment of the majority of patients with IPF, as acknowledged by a National Institutes of Health expert panel [3] as well as the international consensus statement on IPF [1]. Various targets have been identified for the pharmacologic treatment of IPF (Table 3.4), and recent clinical trials have focused on antifibrotic therapies (e.g. interferon-$\gamma$, pirfenidone, bosentan, and etanercept) as potential treatments for IPF. A recent prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, 2-year multicenter trial in which researchers examined recombinant human interferon-$\gamma$, which has been shown experimentally to down-regulate TGF-$\beta$ production, was prematurely terminated because of a lack of efficacy. A post-hoc, subgroup analysis of a previous Phase III trial of 1-year duration had suggested that patients with less severe derangement in lung function may benefit from treatment with interferon-$\gamma$ [67], but this observation was not supported by the subsequent 2-year trial. Phase II trials with etanercept, bosentan, and pirfenidone have been completed, and Phase III trials with pirfenidone and bosentan are currently in progress. Although immunomodulatory therapies have shown little benefit for clinically stable patients with IPF, corticosteroids may have a role in the treatment and stabilization of patients who develop an acute exacerbation of IPF.</p>
                        <p>Various mediators that appear to play a significant role in IPAH or experimental PH have been implicated or may play an important role in IPF-associated PH as well as in IPF lung fibrogenesis. These mediators include inflammatory cell-derived profibrotic leukotrienes generated by 5-lipoxygenase, which is up-regulated in pulmonary arteries of patients with IPAH [68,69], and ET-1, which promotes growth of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle as well as pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction [70]. Other mediators that can promote fibrogenesis and/or pulmonary vascular remodeling include TNF-$\alpha$, PDGF, and fibroblast growth factor. Decreased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production can promote increased levels of TNF-$\alpha$ and TGF-$\beta$, and PGE2 levels are decreased in BAL fluids as well as alveolar macrophage-conditioned media from patients with IPF [68], and PGE2 and prostacyclin synthases have been shown to be depressed in vascular tissue of patients with IPAH [71].</p>
                        <p>There are relatively few studies that have examined the treatment of PH associated with IPF. However, a number of different pharmacologic agents have been approved for the treatment of IPAH. Agents used to treat IPAH target calciumchannels, ET-1 receptors, prostaglandin-mediated vasodilatation and phosphodieste-rase-5 (PDE5) inhibition, although calcium-channel blockade has been useful for treating only a very small subset of patients with IPAH. Prostacyclin (PGI2), which is endogenously produced, induces vasodilation and also inhibits platelet aggregation and smooth muscle proliferation, and PGI2 analogs such as epoprostenol have been shown to improve exercise capacity and hemodynamic indices as well as outcomes in IPAH [72]. ET-1 receptor antagonists [73,74] and the PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil [75], have also been shown to benefit patients with IPAH.</p>

                        <p>Although epoprostenol may have benefit for IPF-associated PH and can decrease mPAP and increase cardiac index when given intravenously, it can significantly increase shunt [76]. However, in contrast to intravenous epoprostenol, inhaled epoprostenol can decrease mPAP without increasing shunt fraction [76]. A randomised clinical trial of inhaled epoprostenol has been completed, but results are not yet available.</p>
                        <p>Lung tissue from patients with IPF has increased expression of ET-1 [77,78], and ET-1 levels have been shown to correlate with PAP but correlate inversely with arterial oxygen levels [79]. ET-1 antagonism could potentially benefit patients with IPF-associated PH, and blockade of the profibrotic properties of ET-1 make ET-1 receptor antagonists an especially attractive treatment modality. Although the ET-1 antagonist, bosentan, has been examined for the treatment of IPF [80], only patients who lacked echocardiographic and clinical evidence of significant PH were enrolled in this trial, and no clinical trials of ET-1 antagonists have specifically targeted patients with IPF-associated PH.</p>
                        <p>The use of sildenafil has been shown to decrease vascular remodeling in animal models of hypoxic PH [81,82], and PDE5 inhibitors can block smooth muscle proliferation and promote vasodilatation by increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels in the lung [75,83]. Ghofrani et al. [84] demonstrated decreased mPAP and shunt flow and increased arterial oxygen tension with a single dose of sildenafil. Collard et al. [85] subsequently performed a pilot study in 14 patients with IPFassociated PH and demonstrated improvement in 6-MWT distance. However, no randomised clinical trial has been performed to date to evaluate the efficacy of PDE5 inhibition for this patient population.</p>
                        <p>In situ thrombosis has been identified as playing a role in IPAH pathogenesis, and a nonrandomised epidemiologic study associated anticoagulation with improved outcome [86]. In situ thrombosis has also been suggested to contribute to PH in patients with pulmonary fibrosis [87], and a randomised clinical trial in patients with IPF suggested that anticoagulation may improve outcome [88]. However, this study had many problems, including the lack of a placebo arm that substantially limit any conclusions that can be drawn from this study, and a significant impact of anticoagulation therapies on IPF or IPF-associated PH remains to be identified.</p>
                        <p>Interventions other than immunomodulatory or antifibrotic pharmacologic therapies may benefit patients with IPF. Lung transplantation is an option for those who meet criteria for listing at a transplant center, and survival after listing for lung transplantation is decreased for waitlisted patients who do not undergo lung transplantation in comparison to those who receive transplants. In addition to survival, quality of life can improve considerably for those who undergo successful lung transplantation. Because the diagnosis of IPF confers a relatively poor prognosis, an expert panel convened under the auspices of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation recommended referral of eligible patients to a transplant center at the time that a radiographic or histologic diagnosis of IPF is made [89]. Patients who undergo lung transplantation must comply with a complex medical treatment plan and have frequent monitoring to detect graft rejection or infection, and 5-year survival for single lung transplant (Kaplan-Meier) is only $43\%$. Other interventions, including those that target co-morbidities, may improve quality of life and relieve symptoms of the disease. Supplemental oxygen is generally given when evidence of resting hypoxaemia or significant exercise-induced or nocturnal hypoxaemia is detected.</p>

                        <p>IPF is a distinct form of IIP that is characterised by radiological and /or histopathologic changes of UIP in the lungs of adults in whom there is no clinical condition (e.g., rheumatologic disorder) or exposure associated with pulmonary fibrosis. IPF appears to be increasingly diagnosed today in comparison to past decades and portends a poor prognosis, especially if complicated by the development of PA hypertension. Extensive vascular remodeling occurs in IPF in association with progressive parenchymal scar formation, and many patients develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication of pulmonary fibrosis. No therapies have been able to make an impact on survival in IPF, and clinical studies/trials to determine effective pharmacologic therapies for PA hypertension complicating IPF are needed. Lung transplantation is currently considered the most effective therapy for IPF, and pharmacologic agents that prevent or modulate progressive lung fibrosis in IPF are currently underway.</p>
