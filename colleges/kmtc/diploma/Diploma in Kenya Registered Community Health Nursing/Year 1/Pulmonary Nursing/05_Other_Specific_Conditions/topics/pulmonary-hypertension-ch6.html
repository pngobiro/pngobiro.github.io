                        <p>Bronchioles are small airways (diameter of $\leq 2 \text{ mm}$) lacking cartilage [1-3]. Bronchioles have a lining epithelium that includes ciliated cells, non-ciliated surfactant-secreting (clara) cells, mucin-secreting goblet cells, basal cells, and occasional neuroendocrine (Kulchitsky) cells [2]. The proximal bronchioles (membranous and terminal) are purely air-conducting, whereas the distal respiratory bronchioles contain alveolar tissue within their walls [4]. Respiratory bronchioles communicate directly with alveolar ducts and are in the range of 0.5 mm in diameter [5]. The gas-exchanging unit of the lung, termed the acinus or primary pulmonary lobule, comprises one terminal bronchiole, two to five generations of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli [5]. Connective tissue anchors the bronchiole to the surrounding alveolar and perivascular interstitium [2]. Each bronchiole travels with an arteriole, forming a bronchovascular bundle; small lymphatics also course along the bronchovascular bundles [2].</p>

                        <p>Bronchiolar inflammation and/or fibrosis can occur as a result of myriad disorders or injuries to the small airways [1,3,5]. Some causes of bronchiolar disorders include infections, connective tissue disease (CTD) [6]; inhalational injuries [7]; drug reactions [6]; lung transplant recipients (LTRs) with chronic allograft rejection [8]; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [9]; diverse immunologic disorders [10]; large airway disorders [11]; and unknown causes [4,5]. Clinical classification is based on proven or presumptive etiology [4,12]. A clinical classification schema has been proposed (Table 6.1) [1], but it has not been universally adopted. In 2003, Rhu et al. [5] proposed classifying bronchiolar disorders into three major categories (see Table 6.2) [5]. In this schema, seven primary bronchiolar disorders are recognised (i.e., the process was limited to bronchioles anatomically): four bronchiolar disorders associated with interstitial lung disease and three disorders associated with large airways disease.</p>

                        <p>Given the exhaustive differential diagnosis and spectrum of bronchiolar disorders, in this chapter we focus our discussion on two major histopathologic patterns of bronchiolar disorders, each of which may be observed in diverse clinical settings: (1) organizing pneumonia (OP) and (2) obliterative bronchiolitis (OB). These entities, OP and OB, differ dramatically clinically, radiographically, and prognostically. OP (whether idiopathic or associated with a specific disease) is characterized by a restrictive defect on pulmonary function tests (PFTs), consolidation on chest radiographs (mimicking pneumonia), and excellent prognosis and responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy [13-15]. In contrast, OB (formerly termed bronchiolitis obliterans) is characterised by severe airflow obstruction, the absence of parenchymal infiltrates on chest radiographs, poor responsiveness to therapy, and high mortality rates [4,5,16].</p>

Infectious bronchiolitis is characterized by acute bronchiolar injury, epithelial necrosis, inflammation and oedema of the bronchial wall, and intramural exduates (Fig. 6.1A) [18]. Infectious bronchiolitis is most often observed in infants and children (particularly as the result of RSV infections), but may affect adults. Symptoms include cough, wheezing, and dypsnea [5].

At low-power magnification, pale-shaped round or oval plugs of granulation tissue fill the bronchiolar lumens; these plugs contain proliferating fibroblasts, edema, fibrin, mucopolysaccharides, and immature connective tissue [2]. Ancillary features include chronic inflammation of alveolar walls and foamy alveolar macrophages [2]. The alveolar architecture is preserved, and fibrosis is not a prominent feature [17].

Diverse conditions have been associated with OB (discussed later) [3-5]. The respiratory bronchioles in OB are concentrically narrowed and "obliterated" by collagen (Fig. 6.2). The fibrosing inflammatory process surrounds the bronchiolar lumens, resulting in extrinsic compression and obliteration of airways (Fig. 6.2B) [5]. Additional findings include distortion of the lumens; mucostasis; bronchiolar smooth muscle hypertrophy; and patchy, chronic inflammation [2]. These changes may be patchy and subtle, even in seriously affected patients [5]. Thus, transbronchial lung biopsies (TBBs) rarely substantiate the diagnosis. Surgical lung biopsy can be used to confirm the diagnosis when histological confirmation is necessary [5]. Elastic stains and serial sections may be necessary to appreciate the fibrotic component [5].</p>

                                <p>RB is a specific form of bronchiolitis in cigarette smokers characterized by pigmented macrophages within the lumens of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and sacs (Fig. 6.1C) [20]. Macrophages in RB are characterized by eosinophilic cytoplasm with superimposed light brown and finely granular pigments that represent constituents of cigarette smoke [2]. Respiratory bronchiolitis is a relatively specific morphological marker of cigarette smoking [21]. Typically, RB is an incidental finding that is not associated with specific symptoms [20]. Progression of the lesion into distal airways spaces (termed RB-ILD) may be associated with cough, dyspnea, and restrictive defects on PFTs [22]. Chest computed tomographic (CT) scans reveal centrilobular micronodules [20]. The prognosis of RB or RB-ILD is generally good. Improvement occurs in most patients after cessation of smoking, but the disease progresses in a minority of patients [20]. Corticosteroids have been used, with anecdotal successes, in patients exhibiting worsening disease [20].</p>

                        <p>HRCT scans are critically important to discern patterns of bronchiolar disorders (Table 6.5) [1,25,30-32]. Normal bronchioles are not visible on HRCT, but diseased bronchioles with dilated lumens (>2 mm in diameter) or thickened walls can be visualised [25]. Muller and Miller [33] first classified bronchiolar disorders based on three CT patterns: (1) nodules and branching lines; (2) ground-glass attenuation and consolidation; and (3) low attenuation and mosaic perfusion [33]. V- or Y-shaped branching linear opacities (the so-called "tree-in-bud" pattern) [32] reflect inflammatory cells, mucus, or debris within bonchiolar lumens (Fig. 6.3A and 6.3B) [18]. Poorly defined centrilobular nodules or ground glass opacities (GGOs) reflect inflammatory cells within the peribronchiolar alveoli (Fig. 6.4A and 6.4B) [18]. Consolidation reflects extension of the inflammatory process into the lung parenchyma (Fig. 6.5). These CT findings (i.e., linear opacities, tree-in-bud pattern, centrilobular nodules, GGOs, consolidation) may be found in diverse infectious [12] or noninfectious [5,25] causes of bronchiolitis but may also be seen in lymphangitic spread of cancer, bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma, sarcoidosis, pulmonary edema, hypersensitivity pneumonia [34], vasculitis, etc. [25].</p>

                        <p>Characteristic CT features of constrictive bronchiolitis or OB include bronchial dilation or bronchial wall thickening; patchy areas of decreased lung attenuation (hyperlucency); mosaic pattern of perfusion (low and high areas of attenuation); and air-trapping (best appreciated on expiratory images) (Fig. 6.6A and 6.6B) [18]. The use of dynamic CT is more sensitive in detecting regional abnormalities and air-trapping [5]. The mosaic pattern is caused by hypoventilation of alveoli distal to the bronchiolar obstruction and resultant secondary vasoconstriction (i.e., reduced perfusion and low attenuation on CT) in the affected lung [5]. Uninvolved segments of lung show normal or increased perfusion with resultant normal or increased attenuation [5]. Mosaic perfusion is not specific for bronchiolar disorders but may be caused by pulmonary vascular obstruction [5,25,35].</p>

                        <p>OP is a histological pattern that may be observed in the context of specific medical disorders (e.g., radiation or chemotherapy-induced injury; HSCT or lung transplant recipients; inhalation injury; CTD; idiopathic) [4,13-15]. The term cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) was introduced by Davison et al. in 1983 [36]. The term bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), cited in a classic article in 1985 [37], is synonymous with OP. In 2002, a consensus statement published by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society advocated using the term COP to refer to the idiopathic variant [38]. Comprehensive reviews of diverse bronchiolar disorders have been published elsewhere [4,15].</p>

Extrapulmonary involvement does not occur. The course is subacute or chronic, developing over the course of 2 to 12 weeks [13,14,37,39]. An antecedent respiratory tract infection precedes the onset of symptoms in one-third of patients [13,14,37,39]. Physical examination reveals rhonchi and "mid-inspiratory squeaks" or rales; however, wheezing is not a feature [14,37]. The constellation of these features mimics an infectious etiology. The diagnosis is usually not suspected until patients fail to respond to antibiotic therapy.</p>

Any lobe may be involved, but a basilar predominance is more common [13,14]. A more diffuse pattern, with a reticulonodular pattern, may be observed in $10-30\%$ of patients with COP [13,14]. Pleural effusions, cavitation, or intrathoracic lymphadenopathy are not features of COP. Chest CT scans in COP demonstrate peripheral consolidations ($80-95\%$) and GGOs (>80%), with subpleural and/or peribronchial predominance [40-42].

                                <p>Corticosteroids (CS) are the cornerstone of therapy for COP and are highly efficacious. Complete resolution is achieved in more than three-quarters of patients [5, 13, 39]. The optimal dose and duration of therapy have not been studied in randomized trials. An initial dose of prednisone $40-60 \text{ mg/day}$ or equivalent is adequate; lower doses may be used in patients at increased risk for side effects [13, 14, 39]. Responses are usually dramatic (within 24-72h). Relapses occur in $50-80\%$ of patients as CS are tapered or discontinued [13,14,39]. Some patients require long-term (sometimes indefinite) therapy with low-dose prednisone (e.g., $10-20 \text{ mg}$ every other day) to maintain remissions. A minority of patients [$10-15\%$] have progressive disease that is recalcitrant to CS therapy [14,39,44]. Immunosuppressive or cytotoxic agents (e.g., azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, etc.) are reserved for patients who are unresponsive to or who are experiencing adverse effects from CS. Data evaluating these agents are limited to anecdotal cases. Fatalities attributed to COP were noted in $2-8\%$ of patients [13,14,39].</p>

                                <p>OP occurs in approximately $2.5\%$ of women treated with radiation therapy for breast cancer [47-51]. The incidence of OP appears to be lower in patients treated with thoracic radiation for lung cancer or other malignancies [15,52]. Fever, cough, dyspnea, and peripheral alveolar opacities on chest radiographs develop 1-12 months after completion of radiation therapy [51,53]. Migratory infiltrates, initially observed in the irradiated area, spread to nonirradiated areas in the ipsilateral lung and to the contralateral lung [51,53]. This migratory pattern distinguishes OP from radiation pneumonitis. Chest CT scans reveal peripheral air-space opacities with air-bronchograms [53]. Lymphocytosis on BAL is typical; BAL neutrophilia or eosinophilia is present in a minority of patients [51,53]. Lymphocytic alveolitis on BAL (predominantly CD4+ T cells) may also be observed in radiation-induced pneumonitis [50,51,54].</p>
                                <p>CS are the cornerstone of therapy. CSs usually affect clinical and radiographic improvement within 1-2 weeks, but relapses may occur while tapering or stopping CS [51,53]. Immunosuppressive agents are not required. Macrolides were effective in three cases for OP complicating radiation therapy [49]. The salutorious effect of macrolides likely reflects immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory properties [55,56].</p>

OP has also been described among LTRs, and is believed to represent a form of acute allograft rejection [58-60]. Early reports of OP in LTRs often were associated with infection [58-60]. Subsequent series found that OP was often associated with acute allograft rejection and may progress to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) or OB [61]. In one review, histological features of OP were found in 17 of 163 (10%) LTRs; acute rejection was present concurrently in 11 (65%) [61]. Ten of the 17 patients (59%) with OP eventually developed OB. Other investigators detected OP in $34\%$ of biopsies from LTRs; OP was associated with an increased risk of BOS [hazards ratio of 1.75] [62]. Gastroesophageal reflux has been suggested as a cause of both OP and OB in LTRs [63-66], but this link is controversial [67].</p>

                        <p>Constrictive (obliterative) bronchiolitis is the prototype of an obstructive bronchiolar disorder resulting in airflow obstruction [78]. The term bronchiolitis obliterans (no longer used) is synonynous with OB. Clinical features include cough, dyspnea, irreversible airflow obstruction (reduced expiratory flow rates) and, in some cases, fatal respiratory insufficiency [78]. The most common causes of OB are chronic lung allograft rejection [8,57] or graft versus host disease among HSCT recipients [9,79,80]. Myriad other etiologies of OB include CTD [6]; drugs [6]; chronic hypersensitivity pneumonia [34]; inhalation injury [7,77]; inhalation of mineral dust, particulate matter or pollutants [2,23']; IgA nephropathy [81]; ataxia telangiectasia [82]; lysinuric protein intolerance [83]; consumption of uncooked leaves of Sauropus androgynus [84]; idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease [10,85]; HIV infection [78]; gastroesophageal reflux [86]; diffuse neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia [87,88]; exposure to a volatile agent (diacetyl) in workers in microwave-popcorn plants [74,75]; and exposure to massive amount of ambient dust by firefighters and workers in New York City on September 11, 2001 [77]. When no cause is identified, the term cryptogenic obliterative (constrictive) bronchiolitis is used [89]. Given the rarity of OB, we limit our discussion to OB complicating organ transplantation (lung or HSCT).</p>

                                <p>BOS, a manifestation of chronic allograft rejection, is the leading cause of death among LTRs after the first year [57,90]. The terms OB, bronchiolitis obliterans, and constrictive bronchiolitis are synonymous [8]. Elicitation of inflammatory mediators, immune cells, and cytokines may give rise to an exuberant fibroproliferative process, leading to granulation tissue within the lumen of the allograft airways and ultimately collagenous obliteration of the airways [8]. Recipient bone marrowderived fibroblasts and myofibroblasts contribute to the fibrotic process [91]. Lymphocytic bronchitis or bronchiolitis is often a precursor to BOS [92]. Clinically, BOS is characterized by progressive decline in lung function and ultimately, fatal respiratory failure [8,57]. Although BOS is rare within the first year after lung transplantation (LT), the cumulative incidence of OB post-LT ranges from $43\%$ to $80\%$ [8,67]. In early studies among LTRs, $58\%$ of adults developed BOS [93] and $63\%$ of children [94] by 3 years. At 5 years, $75\%$ of adults had developed BOS [93]. In more-recent studies, the incidence of BOS decreased modestly.</p>
                                <p>The International Society of Heart Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Registry in 2005 analyzed 7,775 LTRs followed between 1994 and 2005 [95]. In that cohort, freedom from BOS was $91\%$ at 1 year, $71\%$ at 3 years, and $57\%$ at 5 years after LT [95]. The lower incidence of BOS in recent surveys may reflect more aggressive prophylaxis against cytomegalovirus (CMV), and earlier detection and treatment of episodes of acute rejection (AR). Even a single episode of mild AR increases the risk of BOS [96-98]. Further, treating AR decreases the risk of OB. These data support the role of surveillance bronchoscopy among LTRs [96], aiming to identify and treat even asymptomatic episodes of minimal or mild rejection [98-100]. However, the value of surveillance bronchoscopy remains controversial [57].</p>

                                <p>The dominant risk factor for BOS or BO is acute allograft rejection [90,97]. Multiple or severe episodes of AR or late-onset AR increase the risk of BOS [62,97,101,102]. However, additional co-factors play contributory roles, including CMV and non-CMV community-acquired respiratory infections) [90,103-105]; injury to the allograft or airways [106-108]; human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatching [57]; organizing pneumonia [8,62,102]. Marked HLA mismatches was associated with greater rates of late graft failure and OB in some studies [62,109111], but analysis of >3,500 LTRs from the ISHLT database found no significant association between HLA mismatching and development of BOS [112]. This lack of association likely reflects the fact >95% of LTRs have more than 2 HLA mismatches [112]. This high degree of HLA mismatching reflects the need to harvest donor organs within a few hours, precluding HLA matching between donors and recipients prior to transplantation [57]. Plausible, but unproven, risk factors for BOS include nonimmune injury to the lung allograft or airway [106-108]. The pathogenesis of BOS among LTRs is complex and involves myriad cell types and release of diverse cytokines and chemokines [8,113].</p>

                            <div class="content-card">
                                <p>Confirming the diagnosis of OB histologically is difficult. Because of the patchy nature of OB , and small sample size, the yield of TBBs in detecting OB is low (<15-48%) [114-116]. Surgical lung biopsy has a greater yield but is infrequently performed. A diagnosis of BOS is presumed when LTRs develop progressive airflow obstruction not explained by other etiologies.</p>
                                <p>Pulmonary function tests in patients with OB demonstrate a decrease in expiratory flow rates (e.g., forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV${}_{1}$] or maximum midexpiratory flow rates [MMEF${}_{25-75}$]) [117]. Typically, there is no improvement followed inhaled bronchodilators. Spirometry is useful to diagnose and follow the course of BOS. In 1993, a consensus committee sponsored by the ISHLT proposed a clinical definition of BOS among LTRs; identification of BOS and severity was based on spirometric values [118]. In a later publication, BOS was divided into five stages, based on severity of pulmonary dysfunction [119]. Further, subtypes were identified as follows: "a": no pathological material available; "b": pathological evidence for OB.</p>
                                <p>Spirometry remains the key surrogate parameter to identify patient with BOS, and follow-the course of the disease. In two recent studies, serial FEV, values were as sensitive and specific as MMEF${}_{25-75}$ criteria [120,121]. Exhaled nitric oxide [122], exhaled breath condensate [122], single breath washout tests [123], and serum or urine biomarkers [57] have been applied to detect acute or chronic lung allograft rejection, but these sophisticated studies have not been shown to be superior to spirometry.</p>
                                <p>The use HRCT scans demonstrates dilation of proximal bronchi, bronchial wall thickening, patchy areas of low attenuation (hyperlucency), and a mosaic pattern of attenuation in $62-80\%$ of LTRs with OB [8,124-126]. End-expiratory images are more senstitive than inspiratory CT scans [124-126]. The extent of air-trapping on expiratory CT correlated with BOS severity, but spirometry is superior to CT in this regard [124]. However, CT has an adjunctive role to exclude other causes of airflow obstruction from BOS (e.g., anastomotic complications or stenosis, infection, hyperinflation of the contralateral lung, to name a few). The use of BAL demonstrates the presence of increased neutrophils [127-130] and up-regulation of certain cytokines [8,129-133] in patients with BOS or at risk for BOS. However, the clinical value of BAL is controversial.</p>

                                <p>The onset of BOS is variable, ranging from 3 months to >9 years after LT [8,57,134]. Progressive airflow obstruction, recurrent lower respiratory tract infections and, ultimately, fatal respiratory insufficiency, is typical [57,62,92,135]. Physical examination is often unrevealing. Rales, wheezing, rhonchi, and inspiratory "squeaks" are late findings. Late in the course of BOS, superinfection and/or colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Aspergillus spp is common.</p>
                                <p>Five-year mortality post-onset of BOS ranges from $57\%$ to $74\%$ [57,62,92,134136]. However, the course is variable [134,136]. BOS may present insidiously or suddenly [57,134,136]. In some LTRs, a gradual and inexorable downhill course ensues. In others, the disease is quiescent after an initial abrupt decrease in lung function, with prolonged periods of stability (months or even years). Respiratory viral infections may be associated with an abrupt onset of BOS and precipitous decline in lung function [62,103,104]. Early-onset" BOS (defined as within the first 3 years of LT) has a more rapid decline in FEV${}_{1}$, greater need for oxygen dependency, and mortality compared with late-onset BOS (i.e., >3 years) [134,136]. It is possible that differences in clinical course and prognosis reflect differences in cellular profiles and pathogenic mechanisms in accelerated versus chronic OB .</p>

                                <p>Unforunately, no therapy for BOS has been shown to improve survival [57]. Intensification (augmentation) of immunosuppression is the cornerstone of therapy for AR, but it has not been shown to alter the outcome of BOS or BO [57,137]. Pulse methylprednisolone, adding or altering immunosuppressive regimens, the addition of methotrexate [138], cyclophosphamide [139], rapamycin [140,141], cytolytic agents (e.g., OKT3 antibody, antilymphocyte globulin, antithymocyte globulin) [142], interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (e.g., daclizumab, basiliximab) [142,143], total lymphoid irradiation [144], extracorporeal phototherapy [145], and aerosolized cyclosporin A [146] have been used [57], but none of these regimens has been proven to influence pulmonary function or survival. Data regarding treatment for OB or BOS are limited to small nonrandomized studies and anecdotal reports.</p>
                                <p>Recently, azithromycin has been used, with anecdotal successes, in LTRs with BOS [147-150]. In the sentinel study, five of six LTRs with BOS improved their FEV${}_{1}$ (by a mean of $17\%$) [147]. In a subsequent prospective study, 14 LTRs with BOS were treated with azithromycin (in addition to conventional immunosuppression) for 3 months [149]. Overall, mean FEV${}_{1}$ increased by $13\%$ and BAL neutrophils and interleukin- 8 levels decreased. Importantly, FEV${}_{1}$ increased more than $10\%$ above baseline in six patients ($43\%$). By contrast, Shirit et al [150] cited stable FEV${}_{1}$ (mean duration follow-up 10 months) among 11 LTRs with BOS treated with azithromycin in an open-label trial (nine were colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Although no patient improved, azithromycin may have slowed the rate of disease progression. Given the limited number of patients in these various studies, and the lack of placebo-controlled trials, the value of azithromycin remains unproven.</p>
                                <p>A link between gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and BOS has been suggested [67,151]. The incidence of GER increases after LT [65,66,152]. The mechanisms by which LT increases the incidence of GER is likely multifactorial, reflecting dysfunction of the vagus nerve and effects of immunosuppressive medications on gastric emptying and lower esophageal sphincter function [67]. Aggressive treatment of GER among LTRs may improve lung function [67,153]. In one study of LTRs with GER, fundoplication was shown to improve lung function and survival [153]. For patients with BOS who are unresponsive to medical therapy, retransplantation is an option. However, given the limited number of donor organs, the ethics and role of retransplantation is this context is controversial.</p>

                                <p>OB is a late complication of allogeneic HSCT , occurring >3 months to years after HSCT [79,154-156]. The incidence of OB ranges from $4\%$ to $26\%$ among allogeneic HSCT recipients but is exceptionally rare after autologous HSCT [9,79,80,154,155]. Most cases are associated with chronic graft versus host disease [9,79,80]. The pathogenesis of OB may reflect bronchial epithelial injury induced by donor cytotoxic T cells [9]. However, recipient bone marrow-derived fibroblasts and myofibroblasts likely contribute to the fibrotic process [91]. Additional risk factors for OB include older donor and recipient age, myeloablative conditioning, methotrexate use, antecedent respiratory infection, and immunoglobulin deficiency [9,79]. Recurrent viral infections has also been implicated as a risk factor for OB among HSCT recipients [155].</p>
                                <p>Clinical features are consistent with OB in other disorders: irreversible airflow obstruction; dry cough; dyspnea; and wheezing [79,80]. Chest radiographs may be normal or show hyperinflation; HRCT may reveal bronchial dilation, centrilobular nodules, decreased lung attenuation, and expiratory air trapping [79]. BAL may show increases in neutrophils or lymphocytes or both [80,157]. Twenty percent of HSCT recipients with OB and abnormal PFTs are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis [80]. Transbronchial lung biopsies are usually nondiagnostic. Surgical lung biopsies may show fibrous obliteration of bronchiolar lumens [79] but are rarely indicated because the diagnosis can be presumed without histological confirmation, provided the clinical features are characteristic and other causes have been excluded) [9,79,80,158,159].</p>
                                <p>The clinical course is variable. Disease progression may be rapid, whereas others exhibit a more protracted course [9,155]. CS or intensification of immunosuppression have been the mainstay of therapy, with favorable responses in $8-20\%$ of treated patients $[9,79,80,155,156,158,160]$. One recent study cited improvement or stabilization with high-dose pulse methylprednisolone therapy in seven of nine children with OB complicating HSCT [161]. However, given the lack of randomized, controlled trials, the benefit of this approach is unproven. A favourable response to infliximab (a monoclonal antibody directed against tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$) was cited in a child with OB after HSCT [162]. Macrolide antibiotics have been used, but data are limited to small, uncontrolled trials. One study of eight HSCT recipients with OB cited benefit with azithromycin [156].</p>
                                <p>Irrespective of therapy, fatality rates among HSCT recipients with OB typically exceed $50\%$ [79,80]. In one study of 47 HSCT recipients with OB, only $10\%$ survived 5 years (compared with $40\%$ without OB) [158]. LT may be an option for a patient with life-threatening OB recalcitrant to medical therapy [163].</p>
