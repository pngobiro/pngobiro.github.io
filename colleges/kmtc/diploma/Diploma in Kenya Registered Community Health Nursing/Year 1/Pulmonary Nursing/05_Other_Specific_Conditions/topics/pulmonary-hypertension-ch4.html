                        <p>Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a term that can be applied to many different pathological entities, both idiopathic or of a known cause. In a simplistic way, the term represents diffuse parenchymal lung disease in which there is expansion of the pulmonary interstitium by inflammation with or without fibrosis.</p>
                        <p>The role of the pathologist in the workup of interstitial lung disease is to try to categorize the histopathological changes present in the biopsy specimen into groups of entities that have implications for the clinical management of the patient, prognosis, and response to therapy.</p>
                        <p>The histologic patterns found in interstitial pneumonias are distinctive but, unfortunately, they are not specific and can be observed in a variety of other conditions. For example, the histologic pattern noted in usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) can be detected in collagen vascular diseases as well as in asbestosis or drug reactions. Therefore, the recognition of UIP-like histologic pattern on a lung biopsy raises a differential diagnosis that includes idiopathic UIP, respectively, as well as several other conditions.</p>
                        <p>Surgical biopsies for the diagnosis and classification of ILD are uncommon, which prevents most general pathologists from developing critical knowledge of the histopathological criteria to be able to discriminate the subtle changes among the considerable overlap of histological appearance in ILD. To achieve an accurate pathological diagnosis, it is essential to correlate the findings in the lung biopsy specimen with clinical, high-resolution computed tomography scans, laboratory, and pulmonary function abnormalities. This correlation requires communication between the pathologist and clinical and radiologist colleagues. In this chapter, we discuss the histopathological findings of the most common interstitial pneumonias and the evolving concepts leading to their histopathological classification.</p>

                        <p>The IIPs represent the most common and important group of ILDs. In approximately $30\%$ of the cases, the cause of the interstitial pneumonia is found. In this small group, however, the etiological factors are also heterogeneous and vary from collagenous vascular disease, infection, or injury by toxic agents and drugs. The concept of the histological classification of interstitial pneumonia is still evolving. Many of the histological patterns described are very helpful for the clinical management of the patients independent of whether this is an idiopathic process or not.</p>
                        <p>The American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society have sponsored a panel of experts in the field of thoracic pathology, radiology, and pulmonologists who proposed a multidisciplinary approach in an attempt to correlate specific histological subsets with prognosis and response to therapy [1]. In this classification of ILD, there are paired lists of pathologic terms matched to clinical terms (Table 4.1). The major entities include UIP/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)/cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), organizing pneumonia/cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), diffuse alveolar damage/acute interstitial pneumonia (DAD/ AIP), respiratory bronchiolitis/respiratory bronchiolitis-interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP).</p>
                        <p>There is a subset of patients with interstitial pneumonia that remain unclassifiable even after extensive clinical, radiologic, and/or pathological examination. This problem often exists in cases where some critical piece of data is unavailable; examples include inadequate clinical information or inadequate chest radiologic images; an inadequate or nondiagnostic lung biopsy as the result of its small size (a bronchoscopic or needle biopsy), poor sampling; or the presence of only a nondiagnostic pattern of end-stage fibrosis with honeycombing on the specimen. In some cases, the data are completely conflicting.</p>

                        <p>UIP is the most important of all the ILDs because it carries a poor prognosis and no effective therapy is recognized. Therefore, when evaluating a pulmonary biopsy for ILD, the pathologist must determine whether it shows histological features of a UIP or a non-UIP pattern. However, the UIP histologic pattern occurs in a variety of clinical settings, particularly in patients with collagen vascular diseases.</p>
                        <p>The diagnosis of UIP can be rendered on the clinical and radiographic basis without the need for open lung biopsy. Biopsies are recommended, when there are atypical clinical and/or radiographic features that are suspicious for another interstitial pneumonia other than UIP or when the clinical diagnosis of UIP is uncertain [2,3].</p>

                                <p>The histologic hallmark of the UIP is patchy interstitial fibrosis often in a subpleural and/or paraseptal distribution alternating with areas of normal lung (Fig. 4.1) [4-9]. The fibrosis is heterogeneous, with old, established fibrosis and areas of recent fibrosis. The old fibrosis is characterized by dense fibrous bands of scar tissue that causes remodeling of the lung architecture resulting in collapse of alveolar walls and formation of cystic spaces. This pattern is called honeycombing.</p>

                                <p>The recent fibrosis consists of fibroblastic foci, a loose type of connective tissue that contains myofibroblasts within a myxoid stroma and few collagen fibers (Fig. 4.2). Smooth muscle proliferation may be found in areas of dense fibrotic scarring.</p>

                                <p>The temporal heterogeneity that characterizes UIP is favored to be the histological correlate of lesions in different healing stages as a result of multiple or continuous injury [10].</p>
                                <p>The fibrotically thickened alveolar septa tend to be lined by hyperplastic cuboidal epithelial cells, bronchiolar epithelium, or squamous metaplastic epithelium. Sometimes the epithelial cells overlying the fibroblastic foci show reactive cellular atypia with abundant cytoplasm, large hyperchromatic nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. Acute exacerbation of UIP can occur [11,12]. In these cases, the lung biopsy often shows a pattern of diffuse alveolar damage with formation of hyaline membranes, superimposed in a UIP pattern [12]. Patients with acute exacerbation of UIP usually are associated with rapidly progressive respiratory failure and worse prognosis.</p>
                                <p>Because one of the most important criteria for the histologic diagnosis of UIP is patchy process with temporal variegation, one of the most limiting factors for the diagnosis of this entity is sampling. It is important that the surgeon is made aware to include in the biopsy areas of relatively normal lung; otherwise, if only areas of honeycomb fibrosis are biopsied, one may only be able to identify a pattern of endstage fibrosis without a more specific diagnosis.</p>
                                <p>The histological heterogeneity of UIP also accounts for overlapping patterns with other interstitial lung diseases. A NSIP pattern could be observed in $25\%$ of cases [13] when multiple biopsies from different lobes are obtained and up to $80\%$ of explanted specimens from UIP patients undergoing transplantation where there is more extensive sampling [14]. Therefore, the pathologist may report the diagnosis of UIP using different levels of certainty. The following approach can be useful: (1) definite UIP, (2) probable UIP, (3) possible UIP, and (4) definitely not UIP [13].</p>

                        <p>The concept of NSIP resulted from the recognition that a group of interstitial pneumonia did not share histological characteristics recognized for the major interstitial lung diseases. In 1994, Katzenstein and Fiorelli [15] reported a series of 64 patients with similar lung biopsy findings and proposed these cases be called "nonspecific interstitial pneumonia." There was a wide range of histologic pattern of NSIP, which occurred in different clinical settings, such as collagen-vascular diseases, slowly resolving DAD, and a variety of environmental exposures [15]. The importance of the histological diagnosis of NSIP is that it has a more favorable prognosis than UIP [6,7,15-18].</p>

                                <p>The NSIP pattern is characterized by uniform interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. NSIP is separated into two groups: cellular NSIP and fibrosing NSIP. Cellular NSIP has a predominance of interstitial inflammatory infiltration over fibrosis, and fibrosing NSIP is predominantly fibrotic. Separation of cellular from fibrosing patterns of NSIP is important due to the significantly better prognosis associated with the former pattern [19]. The NSIP pattern also overlaps with a broad spectrum of different histologic patterns.</p>
                                <p>NSIP is distinguished from UIP by its uniform involvement of the pulmonary parenchyma, in contrast to the patchy infiltrate and temporal heterogeneity of UIP. It generally lacks honeycomb fibrosis. NSIP is thought to represent a reaction to a one-time injury to the lungs.</p>

                                <p>The NSIP, cellular pattern consists primarily of mild-to-moderate interstitial chronic inflammation, usually with lymphocytes and a few plasma cells. The lung, contrary to UIP, is usually uniformly involved, but the distribution of the lesions may be patchy. The infiltrate typically involves the alveolar interstitium but is less severe than the extensive diffuse alveolar septal infiltration observed in lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia. Intraalveolar organizing fibrosis may be present giving a pattern of cellular NSIP and organizing pneumonia.</p>

                                <p>The hallmark of the NSIP, fibrosing pattern is the presence of dense or loose interstitial fibrosis and the lack of temporal heterogeneity characteristic of UIP. Honeycombing is not typical of fibrosing NSIP. Fibroblastic foci, the key lesion that gives the UIP pattern the appearance of temporal heterogeneity, should be inconspicuous or absent. In some cases, the pattern of fibrosis is patchy in distribution, causing remodeling of the lung architecture, sometimes with a subpleural distribution. In such cases, the lack of fibroblastic foci is especially important in distinguishing from the UIP pattern. Foci of proliferation of interstitial smooth muscle may be seen. Lymphoid aggregates are common.</p>

There is typically diffuse histologic involvement of the lung, but the severity may vary in different areas. Edema, hyaline membranes and interstitial acute inflammation characterize the acute phase (Fig. 4.6). Loose organizing fibrosis mostly within alveolar septa and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia characterize the organizing phase [30]. Small to medium-sized pulmonary arterioles commonly show organized thrombi [27-29].

                                <p>The major histologic differential diagnostic considerations include other patterns of diffuse parenchymal lung disorders such as organizing pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonia and UIP as well as potential etiologic considerations such as infection. When hyaline membranes are prominent, the DAD pattern is usually readily recognizable. However, because patients with AIP often undergo surgical lung biopsy during the organizing phase, hyaline membranes may be difficult to identify. The findings of granulomas, viral inclusions, foci of necrosis or neutrophilic abscesses suggest infection. Special stains for microorganisms should routinely be performed to investigate infection. The diagnosis of AIP requires considerable clinical information. Much of the clinical evaluation to exclude specific causes of the DAD is likely to be completed after the lung biopsy has been finalized. In fact, studies on AIP have been based on cases that have been excluded on the basis of information that was probably not available at the time the biopsy diagnosis [31]. Therefore, the best diagnosis many pathologists may be able to make in cases of AIP is "DAD, etiology undetermined." The final diagnosis of AIP cannot be made unless a detailed history is provided. Even after making a careful diagnosis of AIP, an underlying condition such as a collagen vascular disease may declare itself after the initial pulmonary presentation and the original diagnosis of AIP revised.</p>

                        <p>Pulmonary manifestation of collagen vascular diseases are common and may be the major cause of morbidity and mortality in these diseases. There are no specific histologic patterns in the lung for collagen vascular diseases, which makes it almost impossible for the pathologist to make a specific diagnosis. The presence of lymphoid follicles within the pulmonary parenchyma, although not a specific finding, is commonly seen in cases of collagen vascular disease (Fig. 4.7). In most cases, the histologic patterns are similar to those found in idiopathic interstitial lung disease, such as UIP, NSIP, COP, LIP, and DAD [8]. In addition, pulmonary hemorrhagic syndromes, and vasculitis can also be present in collagen vascular diseases. Therefore, clinical, radiographic, and pathological correlations are essential for the accurate diagnosis of the pulmonary alterations.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Among the idiopathic ILD patterns that can be seen in collagen vascular disease, NSIP and organizing pneumonia are the most common, especially in patients with scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, and polymyositis/dermatomyositis. Fortunately, these two manifestations, like their idiopathic counterpart, have a tendency to respond well to steroids and are associated with better survival than patients that present with a pattern of UIP, which can also be seen in the same disease group. In contrast, LIP is a pattern most commonly found in patients with Sjorgren's syndrome.</p>
                        <p>Pulmonary manifestation of drug toxicity is also an important factor in the histological evaluation of lung biopsies from patients with collagen vascular disease. Many of these patients receive immunosuppressive drugs which will prone them to bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial infections. Although most of these infections can be diagnosed without a lung biopsy, granulomatous diseases with an atypical clinicoradiographical presentation may require a biopsy for diagnosis. Viral infections and fungal infections such as Pneumocystis carinii can present as acute respiratory distress syndrome, and a biopsy will show a pattern of DAD. Methotrexate, penicillamine, and gold are the most common drugs used in the treatment of collagen vascular disease that can cause toxicity in the lung. The pulmonary manifestation of these drug reactions are multiple and range from eosinophilic pneumonia to interstitial fibrosis mimicking UIP. Therefore, a strong suspicion for drug toxicity in the setting of collagen vascular disease must be given to the pathologist for correct evaluation of the biopsy material. ILD is relatively uncommon in patients with systemic lupus erythematous compared with other collagen vascular diseases, but all the histological patterns of interstitial lung disease have been described to occur in systemic lupus erythematous.</p>
                        <p>Rheumatoid nodules frequently are found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. They consist of granulomas with a central area of necrosis surrounded by palisading histiocytes. Vasculitis can be seen in adjacent tissue. The combination of granulomatous inflammation and vasculitis brings infectious granulomas as well as Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and bronchocentric granulomas into the histological differential diagnosis.</p>

                        <p>WG is an idiopathic vasculitis syndrome that affects the upper and lower respiratory tract and the kidney, although it can involve any part of the body. Like any idiopathic disease, the histologic diagnosis of WG requires clinicoradiographical correlation. The use of the serum antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) test [33,34] has revolutionized the diagnoses of vasculitis. Two patterns of staining can occur: the cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) and perinuclear (P-ANCA) [35]. The C-ANCA pattern is most common in WG. The P-ANCA pattern can be seen in WG, but it is more characteristic of other idiopathic vasculitis syndromes such as ChurgStrauss syndrome and microscopic polyangiitis. Therefore, a positive C-ANCA test associated with the characteristic clinical picture and histologic findings in a lung biopsy is diagnostic of WG. The ANCA test is also helpful in the differential diagnosis of WG when the histological features are not typical such as in cases of lung biopsies taken early in the course of the disease or after some course of therapy.</p>

                                <p>The major histologic features of WG consist of a triad of necrosis, vasculitis, and inflammation [36]. Most often, the inflammatory infiltrate forms nodules of consolidation consisting of a mixture of neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, giant cells, and eosinophils often with the formation of ill-defined granulomas. In WG, the inflammatory infiltrate extends beyond the area of granuloma with almost no normal intervening lung parenchyma. Parenchymal necrosis is manifested as neutrophilic microabscesses or large zones of geographic necrosis. Multinucleated giant cells scattered randomly or in loose clusters are typical. The vasculitis of WG may affect arteries, veins, or capillaries (neutrophilic capillaritis). The inflammation in the blood vessels is often focal and eccentrically involves the vessel wall. Destruction of the vascular elastic laminae frequently is found.</p>

                                <p>The differential diagnosis of WG in lung biopsies includes granulomatous infection [37], rheumatoid nodules [38], bronchocentric granulomatosis [38-40], and diffuse pulmonary hemorrhagic syndromes [41,42], such as seen in collagen vascular diseases.</p>
                                <p>One of the most important considerations in the diagnosis of WG is the exclusion of infection. Both tuberculosis and fungal infection can cause necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with secondary vasculitis resembling that seen in WG. Therefore, special stains for acid fast bacilli and fungi must be performed in biopsies with granulomatous inflammation where the diagnosis of WG is being considered.</p>
                                <p>Because WG can have a bronchocentric pattern of lung involvement, it must be considered in the differential diagnosis of bronchocentric granulomatosis (BCG). BCG is more of a histological pattern than a separate entity, because the histological changes found in BCG can be present in allergic bronchopulmonary fungal disease, other bacterial and parasitic infections, rheumatoid arthritis, and WG [37,38]. BCG is characterized by granulomatous inflammation involving the walls of bronchi or bronchioles. Contrary to WG, BCG is not associated with a positive ANCA test and it does not have involvement of the upper respiratory tract and the kidney. For the diagnosis of idiopathic BCG, the clinical features of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, rheumatoid arthritis and WG should be excluded and a careful search for microorganisms must be performed.</p>
