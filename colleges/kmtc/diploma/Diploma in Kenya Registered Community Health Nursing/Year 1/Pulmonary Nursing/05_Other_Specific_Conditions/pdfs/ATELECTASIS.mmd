\section*{ATELECTASIS}

Atelectasis refers to closure or collapse of alveoli and often is described in relation to x-ray findings and clinical signs and symptoms.
Atelectasis may be acute or chronic and may cover a broad range of pathophysiologic changes, from microatelectasis (which is not detectable on chest x-ray) to macroatelectasis with loss of segmental, lobar, or overall lung volume.
- The most commonly described atelectasis is acute atelectasis, which occurs frequently in the postoperative setting or in people who are immobilized and have a shallow, monotonous breathing pattern.

Excess secretions or mucus plugs may also cause obstruction of airflow and result in atelectasis in an area of the lung.
- Atelectasis also is observed in patients with a chronic airway obstruction that impedes or blocks air flow to an area of the lung (eg, obstructive atelectasis in the patient with lung cancer that is invading or compressing the airways).
- This type of atelectasis is more insidious and slower in onset.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}
- Atelectasis may occur as a result of reduced alveolar ventilation or any type of blockage that impedes the passage of air to and from the alveoli that normally receive air through the bronchi and network of airways. The trapped alveolar air becomes absorbed into the bloodstream, but outside air cannot replace the absorbed air because of the blockage. As a result, the isolated portion of the lung becomes airless and the alveoli collapse.

This may occur with altered breathing patterns, retained secretions, pain, alterations in small airway function, prolonged supine positioning, increased abdominal pressure, reduced lung volumes due to musculoskeletal or neurologic disorders, restrictive defects, and specific surgical procedures (e.g., upper abdominal, thoracic, or open heart surgery).
- Persistent low lung volumes, secretions or a mass obstructing or impeding airflow, and compression
of lung tissue may all cause collapse or obstruction of the airways, which leads to atelectasis.
- Atelectasis may also result from excessive pressure on the lung tissue, which restricts normal lung expansion on inspiration. Such pressure may be produced by fluid accumulating within the pleural space (pleural effusion), air in the pleural space (pneumothorax), or blood in the pleural space (hemothorax). The pleural space is the area between the parietal and the visceral pleurae.

\section*{Clinical manifestations}

Signs and symptoms include: -cough,
-sputum production,
- -low-grade fever. Fever is universally cited as a clinical sign of atelectasis, but there are few data to support this. Most likely the fever that accompanies atelectasis is due to infection or inflammation distal to the obstructed airway.
- dyspnea,
- tachycardia,
- tachypnea, pleural pain, and central
cyanosis (a bluish skin due that is a late
- In acute atelectasis involving a large amount of lung tissue (lobar atelectasis), marked respiratory distress may be observed.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

Decreased breath sounds and crackles are heard over the affected area.
Chest x-ray findings may reveal patchy infiltrates or consolidated areas.
Depending on the degree of hypoxemia, pulse oximetry (SpO2) may demonstrate a low saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen (less than 90\%)

\section*{Prevention of atelectasis}
${ }^{-}$frequent turning, especially from supine to upright position, to promote ventilation and prevent secretions from accumulating.
${ }^{-}$early mobilization, and strategies to expand the lungs and to manage secretions e.g directed cough, suctioning, aerosol nebulizer treatments followed by chest physical therapy (postural drainage and chest percussion), or bronchoscopy.
- Deep-breathing maneuvers (at least every 2 hours) assist in preventing and treating atelectasis.
- Teach/reinforce appropriate technique for incentive spirometry.
- Administer prescribed opioids and sedatives judiciously to prevent respiratory depression.

\section*{Management of atelectasis}

Goal :to improve ventilation and remove secretions.
${ }^{-}$The strategies to prevent atelectasis, which include frequent turning, early ambulation, lung volume expansion maneuvers (eg, deepbreathing exercises, incentive spirometry), and coughing also serve as the first-line measures to minimize or treat atelectasis by improving ventilation.
- If the cause of atelectasis is bronchial obstruction from secretions, the secretions must be removed by coughing or suctioning to permit air to re-enter that portion of the lung.

Chest physical therapy (chest percussion and postural drainage) may also be used to mobilize secretions.
- Nebulizer treatments with a bronchodilator medication or sodium bicarbonate may be used to assist the patient in the expectoration of secretions.
- If respiratory care measures fail to remove the obstruction, a bronchoscopy is performed.
- Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Prompt treatment reduces the risk for acute respiratory failure or pneumonia.
- With a large pleural effusion that is compressing lung tissue and causing alveolar collapse, treatment may include thoracentesis, removal of the fluid by needle aspiration, or insertion of a chest tube.
- In chronic atelectasis, bronchoscopy may be used to open an airway obstructed by lung cancer or a nonmalignant lesion, and the procedure may involve cryotherapy or laser therapy. The goal is to reopen the airways and provide ventilation to the collapsed area.
- In some cases, suraical management mav
