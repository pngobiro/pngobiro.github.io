\section*{Acute bronchitis}

Bronchitis generally refers to an acute inflammation of the air passages within the lungs. It occurs when trachea and the large and small bronchi become inflamed because of infection or other causes.
- The thin mucous lining of these airways can become irritated and swollen.
- The cells that make up this lining may leak fluids in response to the inflammation
- Coughing is a reflex that works to clear secretions from the lungs. Often the discomfort of a severe cough leads one to seek medical treatment.
- Both adults and children can get bronchitis. Symptoms are similar for both.

\section*{What causes acute bronchitis?}
- Acute bronchitis is almost always caused by viruses that attack the lining of the bronchial tree and cause infection. As the body fights back against these viruses, more swelling occurs and more mucus is made. It takes time for the body to kill the viruses and heal the damage to the bronchial tubes.
- In most cases, the same viruses that cause colds cause acute bronchitis. Research has shown that bacterial infection is a much less common cause of bronchitis. Very rarely, an infection caused by a fungus can cause acute bronchitis
- Bronchitis occurs most often during the cold season, usua coupled with an upper respiratory infection.
- Several viruses cause bronchitis, including influenza A and B, which we commonly call "the flu."
- A number of bacteria are known to cause bronchitis, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae
- Bronchitis also can occur when inhale irritating fumes or dusts Chemical solvents and smoke,,3including tobacco smoke, have been linked to acute bronchitis.
- People at increased risk both of getting bronchitis and of having more severe symptoms include the elderly, those with weakened immune systems, smokers, and anyone with repeated exposure to lung irritants.

\section*{How do people get acute bronchitis?}
- The viruses that cause acute bronchitis are sprayed into the air or onto people's hands when they cough.
- You can get acute bronchitis if you breathe in these viruses. You can also get it if you touch a hand that is coated with the viruses.
- If you smoke or are around damagle fumes (such as those in certain 霊nds factories), you are more likely to gét acute bronchitis and to have it longer. This is because your bronchial tree is already damaged.
- Smoking damages the bronchial tree and makes it easier for viruses to cause infection. Smoking also slows down the healing, so it takes longer for one to get well.

\section*{Bronchitis symptoms}
- Acute bronchitis most commonly occurs after an upper respiratory infection such as the common cold. Therefore, you may see symptoms such as fever with chills, nasal congestion, and sore throat.
- Cough is a common symptom of bronchitis. The cough may be dry or may produce phlegm.
Significant phlegm production suggests that the lower respiratory tract and the lung itself may be infected.
- The cough may last for more that ha to weeks. Continued forceful cother may make the chest and abdominal muscles sore.
- Wheezing may occur because of the inflammation of the airways. This may leave one short of breath.

\section*{treatment}
- Most cases of acute bronchitis on their own after a few days or a week.
- It's a good idea to get plenty of rest in order to give the body time to heal,
- drink lots of non caffeinated fluids (for example, water and fruit juices) (2-3 liters/day) in order to liquefy the secretions.
- increase humidity in the environment.
- Cough suppressants can be prescribed for only the dry cough.
Cough expectorants for productive cough.
Aspirin or paracetamol can be prescribed to reduce fever \& alleviate symptoms of inflammation.
- Because acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses, antibiotics usually do not help much but they are prescribed if there is an evidence of bacterial infection (symptoms lasting more than 2 weeks) or in patients at high risk of getting pneumonia.

For severe productive cough that is not responding to antibiotics sputum for culture and sensitivity should be obtained.
- If you smoke, you should put down on the number of cigarettes you
smoke, or stop smoking altogether. This will help your bronchial tree heal faster.
- For some people with acute bronchitis, medicines that are usually used to treat asthma such as bronchodilators and corticosteroids can be prescribed.
These medicines help to open the bronchial tubes and clear out mucus. They are usually given with an inhaler.

\section*{Preventive measures of acute bronchitis}
- One of the best ways to keep from getting acute bronchitis is to wash hands often to get rid of any viruses.
- If you smoke, the best defense against acute bronchitis is to quit. Smoking damages the bronchial tree and makes it easier for viruses to cause infection. Smoking also slows down the healing, so it takes longer for one to get well.
