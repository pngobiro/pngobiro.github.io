\section*{Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases(COPD)}
1. Asthma
- Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory lung disease involving recurrent breathing problems. The characteristics of asthma are three airway problems:
- Obstruction, Inflammation, Hyper-responsiveness

Before an Asthma Episode

\section*{2. Chronic Bronchitis}

Chronic bronchitis is a long-term inflammation of the bronchi, which results in increased production of mucous, as well as other other changes.
3. Pulmonary Embolism

Pulmonary embolism, a severe and life-threatening condition, is the blocking of the pulmonary artery by foreign matter such as: a blood clot (thrombus) or pieces of it, Fat, Air, Tumor tissue

\section*{Cystic Fibrosis}

Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease characterized by an abnormality in the glands that produce sweat and mucus. It is chronic, progressive, and may be fatal.
- Symptoms
- Thick mucus that accumulates in lungs and intestines, which can cause:
- Malnutrition, Poor growth, Frequent respiratory infections, Breathing difficulties, Lung disease.
- Diagnosis
- Chemical tests, Chest x-rays, Lung function tests, Sputum cultures, Stool evaluations.

\section*{- Treatment}
- Physical therapy, Exercise to loosen mucus, stimulate coughing and improve overall physical condition, Medications to reduce mucus and help breathing

\section*{$\square$ Pneumonia}
- Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs caused by bacteria, viruses or chemical irritants. It is a serious infection or inflammation in which the air sacs fill with pus and other liquid.
- Lobar pneumonia affects one or more sections (lobes) of the lungs.
- Bronchial pneumonia (or bronchopneumonia) affects patches throughout both lungs.
- Types
- Bacterial
- Viral
- Pneumonic

- Symptoms
- Shaking chills, High temperature
- Chattering teeth,
- Severe chest pain, Cough that produces rust-colored or greenish mucus, Heavy perspiring
- Rapid pulse, Rapid breathing, Bluish color to lips and nail beds, Confused mental state or delirium
- Treatment
- Treatment may include antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia. Antibiotics may also speed recovery from mycoplasma pneumonia and some special cases. There is no clearly effective treatment for viral pneumonia, which usually heals on its own.
- Other treatment may include appropriate diet, oxygen therapy, and pain and cough medication.

\section*{$\square$ Pulmonary Emphysema}
- Emphysema is a chronic lung condition in which alveoli, or air sacs, may be:
- Destroyed, Narrowed, Collapsed
- Stretched, Over-inflated

- Cough \& Shortness of breath

Other symptoms may include:
- Fatigue, Sleep problems
- Anxiety, Depression
- Heart problems, Weight loss
- Treatment
