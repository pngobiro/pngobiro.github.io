\section*{ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY}
- Composed of upper and lower respiratory system
- Together the two are responsible for ventilation
- External respiration is responsible for exchange of gases between blood and the lungs
- Internal respiration involves exchange of gases between cells and blood

\section*{- UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT}

\section*{- FUNCTIONS}
- Protect respiratory system from infection and from foreign body inhalation through sneezing, coughing and spasm
- Warms and filters inspired air so that lower respiratory tract accomplishes gas exchange
- Humidification of air
- Passage way of air into the lower respiratory system

\section*{STRUCTURES OF THE UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT}
- Nose
${ }^{\text {- }}$ Sinuses- four bony cavities of the face and cranium containing air. They drain into the nose
- They serve as resonating chamber for speech and lighten the skull.
- They include; maxillary, ethmoid, frontal and sphenoid
- pharynx; Tube like structure that connect oral and nasal cavities to the larynx. functions as a passage way for respiratory and digestive system.
${ }^{-}$It is divided into ;
- Nasopharnyx which consist of adenoids on posterior wall and lymphoid tissue.
- Oropharynx; lie behind the mouth, consist of palatine tonsil between each pair of folds
- Laryngopharynx- extends from oropharynx and continues as oesophagus

\section*{LARYNX}

Links laryngopharynx and the trachea

\section*{functions}

Voice production
Protection of lower respiratory tract
Passage and humidification of air
- TRACHEA(Windpipe)

Passage between larynx and bronchi.
Contain c shaped of rings of cartilage at intervals which keep the tube open throughout. lined with ciliated mucosa

\section*{Functions}

Support and patency- arrangement of cartilages prevents obstruction and kinking of airway as head and neck moves.
Mucociliary escalator
Cough reflex
Warming, humidfying and filtering

\section*{LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT}
- LUNGS-
- Elastic structures found on each side of midthoracic cavity.
${ }^{-}$They are lined with pleura which consists of serous membrane with small amount of fluid that aid in lubrication.
- Visceral pleura is adherent/covers the lung and parietal pleura is adherent /lines the thorax.
${ }^{-}$Pleural cavity is the only potential space and contains no air and is separated by serous fluid that prevent friction during breathing
- INTERIOR OF THE LUNGSThe
${ }^{-}$lungs are composed of the bronchi and smaller air passages, alveoli, connective tissue, blood vessels, lymph vessels and nerves.

\section*{ALVEOLI}
- These distal respiratory passages are supported by a loose network of elastic connective tissue in which macrophages, fibroblasts, nerves and blood and lymph vessels are embedded. The alveoli are surrounded by a network of capillaries. The exchange of gases during respiration takes place across two membranes, the alveolar and capillary membranes.consist of three types of cells, epithelial, macrophage, and surfactant.

\section*{BRONCHI AND BRONCHIOLES}
${ }^{-}$The two primary bronchi are formed when the trachea divides. The bronchi progressively subdivide into bronchioles, terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and finally, alveoli.
- functions
- Gaseous exchange
- Propel mucus and foreign substances away from the lung
- Allow passage of air in and out of the alveoli
- Support and patency

\section*{FUNCTIONS OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM}
- Oxygen Transport
- Oxygen is supplied to, and carbon dioxide is removed from, cells by way of the circulating blood. Oxygen diffuses from the capillary through the capillary wall to the interstitial fluid. The movement of carbon dioxide occurs by diffusion from cell to blood.
${ }^{-}$Respiration
- This whole process of gas exchange between the atmospheric air and the blood and between the blood and cells of the body
${ }^{-}$ventilation
- Movement of air in and out of the airways

\section*{Muscles of respiration}
- The expansion of the chest during inspiration occurs as a result of muscular activity, partly voluntary and partly involuntary. The main muscles of respiration in normal quiet breathing are the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm. During difficult or deep breathing they are assisted by the muscles of the neck, shoulders and abdomen

\section*{PHYSIOLOGY OF RESPIRATION}
- INSPIRATION
- capacity of the thoracic cavity is increased by simultaneous contraction of the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm. This reduces the pressure in the pleural cavity to a level considerably lower than atmospheric pressure. This stretches the lungs and the pressure within the alveoli and in the air passages falls, drawing air into the lungs in an attempt to equalize the atmospheric and alveolar air pressures. The process of inspiration is active, as it requires expenditure of energy for muscle contraction.

\section*{Expiration}

Relaxation of the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm results in downward and inward movement of the rib cage and elastic recoil of the lungs. As this occurs, pressure inside the lungs exceeds that in the atmophere and therefore air is expelled from the respiratory tract.. This process is passive as it does not require the expenditure of energy. After expiration, there is a pause before the next cycle begins.

\section*{MECHANISM OF GASEOUS EXCHANGE}
- Exchange of gases takes place between alveolar air and capillary blood by the process of diffussion.each gas moves in both direction through the alveolar capillary membrane by diffusion. pressure gradient of each gas causes outward diffusion of co2 from lung capillary blood to the alveoli and inward diffusion of o2 from alveolar air to capillary blood. this exchange lowers pco2 and raises po2.

\section*{Physiological variables affecting respiration}

Elasticity. Elasticity is the term used to describe the ability of the lung to return to its normal shape after each breath. Loss of elasticity of the connective tissue in the lungs necessitates forced expiration and increased effort on inspiration.
Compliance. This is a measure of the distensibility of the lungs, i.e. the effort required to inflate the alveoli. When compliance is low the effort needed to inflate the lungs is greater than normal, e.g. in some diseases where elasticity is reduced or when insufficient surfactant is present. It should be noted that compliance and elasticity are opposing forces.

\section*{CONTROL OF RESPIRATION}
- Normal is involuntary.
- Voluntary is excerted by activities such as speaking and singing
- RESPIRATORY CENTRE
- Situated in brain stem in medulla oblangata and pons
- CHEMORECEPTORS-
- _These are receptors that respond to changes in the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. They are located centrally and peripherally.

\section*{DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES}
- Assignment review notes on history and physical exam of the respiratory system
${ }^{\bullet}$ Lung volumes and capacities
- PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS
- are routinely used in patients with chronic respiratory disorders. They are performed to assess respiratory function and to determine the extent of dysfunction. Such tests include measurements of lung volumes, ventilatory
- function, and the mechanics of breathing, diffusion, and gas exchange PFTs are useful in a patient with an established respiratory disease and assessing the response to therapy.
${ }^{\text {- }}$ They are useful as screening tests in potentially hazardous industries, such as coal mining .
- They are useful for screening patients scheduled for thoracic and upper abdominal surgery

\section*{ARTERIAL BLOOD GASES}
- Measurements of blood pH and of arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions. The arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) indicates the degree of oxygenation of the blood, and the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) indicates the adequacy of alveolar ventilation. Arterial blood gas studies aid in assessing the ability of the lungs to provide adequate oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.
- the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb or excrete bicarbonate ions to maintain normal body pH . Serial blood gas analysis also is a sensitive indicator of whether the lung has been damaged after chest trauma. Arterial blood gas levels are obtained through an arterial puncture at the radial, brachial, or femoral artery or through an indwelling arterial catheter.

\section*{PULSE OXIMETRY}
- Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive method of continuously monitoring the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin A probe or sensor is attached to the fingertip, forehead, earlobe, or bridge of the nose.. Normal SpO2 values are $95 \%$ to $100 \%$. Values less than $85 \%$ indicate that the tissues are not receiving enough oxygen, and the patient needs further evaluation.

\section*{SPUTUM STUDIES}
- Sputum is obtained for analysis to identify pathogenic organisms and to determine whether malignant cells are present. It also may be used to assess for hypersensitivity states
- In general, sputum cultures are used in diagnosis, for drug sensitivity testing, and to guide treatment
- CULTURES Throat cultures may be performed to identify organisms responsible for pharyngitis. Throat culture may also assist in identifying organisms responsible for infection of the lower respiratory tract

\section*{IMAGING STUDIES}
- This include x-rays,CT, MRI, Contrast studies, pulmonary angiography and fluoroscopic
- ENDOSCOPY PROCEDURES
- Bronchoscopy is the direct inspection and examination of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi
- Thoracoscopy
- Thoracoscopy is a diagnostic procedure in which the pleural
- cavity is examined with an endoscope. is primarily indicated in the diagnostic evaluation of pleural effusions, pleural disease, and tumor staging.
- THORACENTESIS -aspiration of pleural fluid for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes).
- BIOPSY - the excision of a small amount of tissue, may be per- formed to permit examination of cells from the pharynx, larynx, and nasal passages.

MAJOR SYMPTOMS OF THE RESPIRATORY DISEASE
- DYSPNEA
- difficult or labored breathing, shortness of breath.
- is a symptom common to many pulmonary and cardiac disorders, particularly when there is decreased lung compliance or increased airway resistance.
- It may also be associated with neurologic or neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis, Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, or muscular dystrophysignifies, asthma .

\section*{. Clinical Significance}
- In acute diseases of the lungs produce a more severe grade of dyspnea than do chronic diseases.
- Sudden dyspnea in a healthy person may indicate pneumothorax, acute respiratory obstruction, or ARDS. In immobilized patients, sudden dyspnea may denote pulmonary embolism.
- Orthopnea may be found in patients with heart disease and occasionally in patients with (COPD);
- dyspnea with an expiratory wheeze occurs with COPD.
- Noisy breathing may result from a narrowing of the air.

\section*{COUGH}
- Results from irritation of the mucous membranes anywhere in the respiratory tract. by smoke, smog, dust, or a gas. The cough is the patient's chief protection against the accumulation of secretions in the bronchi and bronchioles.

\section*{Â©linical Significance.}
${ }^{\circ}$ Cough may indicate serious pulmonary disease.
- It may be described as dry, hacking, wheezing or severe.
- A dry, irritative cough is characteristic of an upper respiratory tract infection of viral origin . Laryngotracheitis causes an irritative, highpitched cough. A severe or changing cough may indicate bronchogenic carcinoma
- Pleuritic chest pain accompanying coughing may indicate pleural or chest involvement.
${ }^{\circ}$ Cough in the morning with sputum indicate bronchitis
${ }^{\text {e }}$ Cough after food may indicate aspiration in the tracheal bronchial tree

\section*{SPUTUM PRODUCTION}
- Sputum production is the reaction of the lungs to any constantly recurring irritant. It also may be associated with a nasal discharge.

\section*{${ }^{-}$Clinical Significance}
- A profuse amount of purulent sputum or a change in color of the sputum probably indicates a bacterial infection.
${ }^{-}$Thin, mucoid sputum frequently results from viral bronchitis. A gradual increase of sputum over time may indicate the presence of chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis.
- Pink-tinged mucoid sputum suggest lung tumor
${ }^{\bullet}$ Foul smelling sputum indicate indicate lung abcess, bronchiectasis

\section*{CHEST PAIN}
${ }^{\text {emay be associated with pulmonary or cardiac disease. }}$
Chest pain associated with pulmonary conditions may be sharp, stabbing, and intermittent, or it may be dull, aching, and persistent. The pain usually is felt on the side where the pathologic process is located, but it may be referred elsewhere-for example, to the neck, back, or abdomen.

\section*{Clinical Significance.}
${ }^{\text {e }}$ Chest pain may occur with pneumonia, pulmonary embolism with lung infarction, and pleurisy.
${ }^{\text {-It }}$ also may be a late symptom of bronchogenic carcinoma.
${ }^{-}$Pleuritic pain is sharp and intensify on inspiration.
- WHEEZING - is often the major finding in a patient with bronchoconstriction or airway narrowing. It is a high- pitched, musical sound heard mainly on expiration.
${ }^{-}$Relief Measures. Oral or inhalant bronchodilator medications reverse wheezing in most instances.
${ }^{\bullet}$ CLUBBING OF THE FINGERS -is a sign of lung disease found in patients with chronic hypoxic conditions, chronic lung infections, and malignancies of the lung. manifested initially as loss of the nailbed angle

\section*{HEMOPTYSIS}
- expectoration of blood from the respiratory tract
- is a symptom of both pulmonary and cardiac disorders
The most common causes are:
Pulmonary infection
- Carcinoma of the lung
- Abnormalities of the heart or blood vessels
- Pulmonary artery or vein abnormalities
- Pulmonary emboli and infarction
- Chest trauma

\section*{CYANOSIS}
${ }^{\ominus}$,
- is a very late indicator of hypoxia.
- The presence or absence of cyanosis is determined by the amount of unoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood. appears when there is $5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ of unoxygenated hemoglobin.
- Anaemic patient rarely manifests cyanosis and a polycythemic patient may appear cyanotic even if adequately oxygenated. Therefore, cyanosis is not a reliable sign of hypoxia.
- central cyanosis is assessed by observing the color of the tongue and lips.
- Peripheral cyanosis results from decreased blood flow to a certain area of the body,.

\section*{INFEECTIONS OF THE LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT}
- BRONCHITIS
- It is the inflamation of the mucous membrane of the bronchi.
- Acute bronchitis-, an acute inflammation of the mucous membranes of the trachea and the bronchial tree, often follows infection of the upper respiratory tract.
- It is characterized by development of a cough without sputum production.
- Chronic bronchitis is defined clinically when an individual has had a cough with sputum(productive cough) for 3 months in 2 successive years. It is a progressive inflammatory disease resulting from prolonged irritation of the bronchial epithelium:

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}
- In acute tracheobronchitis, the inflamed mucosa of the bronchi produces mucopurulent sputum, often in response to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
- In chronic bronchitis results from repeated irritation of the airway leading to hyperscretion of the mucus and inflammation .There is hypertrophy of the mucus producing gland. mucocilliary clearance is delayed due to decrease in number of ciliated cells, hence productive cough. bronchial lumen is narrowed and fibrosis of

\section*{Predisposing factors}

\section*{${ }^{-}$Acute bronchitis}
- inhalation of physical and chemical irritants, gases, and other air contaminants.
- Smoking, gastric reflux
- Viral and bacterial infections
- Chronic bronchitis
- Long term cigarrete Smoking
- Viral and bacterial infections
- Immunodeficiency
- Long term illness and immobilization

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
- ACUTE BRONCHITIS
${ }^{-}$Initially, the patient has a dry, irritating cough and expectorates a scanty amount of mucoid sputum.
${ }^{\bullet}$ sternal soreness from coughing
${ }^{-}$fever or chills and night sweats,
- headache, and general malaise.
- As the infection progresses, the patient may be short of breath, have noisy inspiration and expiration
- CHRONIC BRONCHITIS
- Productive cough, purulent sputum,
- dyspnea

\section*{Medical management}
- Antibiotic treatment may be indicated depending on the symp- toms, sputum purulence, and results of the sputum culture. Anti- histamines are usually not prescribed because they may cause excessive drying and make secretions more difficult to expectorate.
- Expectorant, mucolytics and bronchodilators may be prescribed.
- Fluid intake is increased to thin the viscous and tenacious secretions.
- Suctioning and bronchoscopy may be needed to remove secretions in chronic conditions
Â© Immunization against viral agentsi.e H.influenza
- Administer mild analgesics and antipyretics

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT}
- In most cases, treatment of acute bronchitis is largely symptomatic. The patient is advised to rest.
- Increasing the vapor pressure (moisture content) in the air will reduce irritation.
- steam inhalations may help relieve laryngeal and tracheal irritation.
- Advise the to stop smoking and avoid irritants
- Give plenty of fluids to liquefy the secretions

\section*{PNEUMONIA}
- This is the inflammation of the lung parenchyma caused by various microorganisms i.e bacteria, viruses, fungi.
- LOBAR PNEUMONIA-occurs if one or more lobes are involved
- BRONCHOPNEUMONIA-It is distributed in patchy fashion within one of localized area in the bronchi.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}

- Pneumonia arises from normally present flora in a patient whose resistance has been altered, or it results from aspiration of flora present in the oropharynx. It may also result from bloodborne organisms that enter the pulmonary circulation and are trapped in the pulmonary capillary bed. An inflammatory reaction can occur in the alveoli, producing an exudate that interferes with the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Areas of the lung are not adequately ventilated because of secretions and mucosal edema that cause partial occlusion of the bronchi or alveoli, with a resultant decrease in alveolar oxygen tension.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF PNEUMONIA}
- Community-acquired pneumonia -occurs either in the community setting or within the first 48 hours of hospitalization
- Hospital-acquired pneumonia ( nosocomial pneumonia) -is the onset of pneumonia symptoms more than 48 hours after admission to the hospital..
- pneumonia in the immunocompromised host are Pneumocystis carinii , fungal pneumonias, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. Immunocompromised states occur with the use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents, chemotherapy, nutritional depletion, use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, AIDS, , and long-term advanced life-support technology (mechanical ventilation).

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}
- Shock and respiratory failure
- Atelectasis and pleural effusion
- Super infection
- meningitis

\section*{LUNG ABCESS}
- is a localized necrotic lesion of the lung parenchyma containing purulent material that collapses and forms a cavity.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Most lung abscesses are a complication of bacterial pneumonia or are caused by aspiration of oral anaerobes into the lung. Abscesses also may occur secondary to mechanical or functional obstruction of the bronchi by a tumor, foreign body, or bronchial stenosis, or from necrotizing pneumonias, TB, pulmonary embolism, or chest trauma.
Most abscesses are found in areas of the lung that may be affected by aspiration.. If the bronchus is involved, the purulent contents are expectorated continuously in the form of sputum. If the pleura is involved, an empyema results The organisms frequently associated with lung abscesses are S . aureus, Klebsiella, and other gram-negative species

\section*{RISK FACTORS}
${ }^{-}$It is generally caused by aspiration of anaerobic bacteria.
${ }^{-}$Patients who have impaired cough reflexes and cannot close the glottis, or those with swallowing difficulties, are at risk for aspirating foreign material and developing a lung abscess.
- patient with central nervous system disorders (seizure, stroke), drug addiction, alcoholism, esophageal disease, or compromised immune function, those without teeth, patients receiving nasogastric tube feedings
- those with an altered state of consciousness from anesthesia.

\section*{THE CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}
- may vary from a mild productive cough to acute illness
- fever and a productive cough with moderate to copious amounts of foul smelling, often bloody, sputum.
- Leukocytosis may be present.
- dull chest pain,
- Dyspnea, weakness, anorexia, and weight loss are common. Fever and cough may develop insidiously and may have been present for several weeks before diagnosis

\section*{Prevention}
- The following measures will reduce the risk of lung abscess:
- Appropriate antibiotic therapy before any dental procedures in patients who must have teeth extracted while their gums and teeth are infected
- Adequate dental and oral hygiene, because anaerobic bacteria play a role in the pathogenesis of lung abscess
- Appropriate antimicrobial therapy for patients with pneumonia

\section*{MEDICAL MANAGEMENT}

Intravenous antimicrobial therapy depends on the results of he sputum culture and sensitivity and is administered for an extended period i.e. Penicillin G or clindamycin, followed by penicillin with metronidazole. Large intravenous doses are generally required because the antibiotic must penetrate the necrotic tissue and the fluid in the abscess. The intravenous dose is continued until there is evidence of symptom improvement.
Long-term therapy with oral antibiotics replaces intravenous therapy after the patient shows signs of improvement (usually 3 to 5 days) and should be continued for an additional 4 to 8 weeks.
${ }^{-}$Adequate drainage of the lung abscess may be achieved through postural drainage and chest physiotherapy.
${ }^{\bullet}$ The patient should be assessed for an adequate cough. A few patients need a percutaneous chest catheter placed for long-term drainage of the abscess.
- Surgical intervention is rare, but pulmonary resection (lobectomy) is performed when there is massive hemoptysis or little or no response to medical management.
- Pleural Condition
${ }^{-}$Pleural conditions are disorders that involve the membranes covering the lungs (visceral pleura) and the surface of the chest wall (parietal pleura) or disorders affecting the pleural space.

\section*{PLEURISY (pleuritis)}
- refers to inflammation of both layers of the pleurae (parietal and visceral).
-When the inflamed pleural membranes rub together during respiration (intensified on inspiration), the result is severe, sharp, knifelike pain.
${ }^{-}$may develop in conjunction with pneumonia or an upper respiratory tract infection, TB, or collagen disease; after trauma to the chest, pulmonary infarction, or pulmonary embolism; in patients with primary and metastatic cancer; and after thoracotomy, rheumatoid arthritis, pneumothorax, pancreatitis

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}
- The key characteristic of pleuritic pain is its relationship to respiratory movement. Taking a deep breath, coughing, or sneezing worsens the pain.
- Sharp knife like pain (stabbing)
- Pleuritic pain is restricted in distribution rather than diffuse; it usually occurs only on one side. The pain may become minimal or absent when the breath is held, or it may be localized or radiate to the shoulder or abdomen.
- Sometimes chest pain may extend to the shoulder
- Decreased movement on the involved wall
${ }^{-}$Rapid or shallow breathing related to pain

\section*{Medical Management}
${ }^{-}$The objectives of treatment are to discover the underlying condition causing the pleurisy and to relieve the pain.
- monitor for signs and symptoms of pleural effusion, such as shortness of breath, pain,

- Administer Prescribed analgesics i.e. Indocid, (NSAID), and topical applications of heat or cold provide symptomatic relief
- If the pain is severe, an intercostal nerve block may be required.

\section*{Nursing Management}
- Because the patient has considerable pain on inspiration, the nurse can offer suggestions to enhance comfort, such as turning frequently onto the affected side to splint the chest wall and reduce the stretching of the pleurae.
- teach the patient to use the hands or a pillow to splint the rib cage while coughing.
- assumption of a position that decreases pain, and decreased chest wall excursion

\section*{PLEURAL EFFUSION}
- It is a collection of fluid in the pleural space.
- Is rarely a primary disease process but is usually secondary to other diseases.

\section*{CAUSES}
${ }^{-}$may be a complication of heart failure, TB, pneumonia, pulmonary infections (particularly viral infections), nephrotic syndrome, connective tissue disease, pulmonary embolism, and neoplastic tumors, autoimmune disease
- Bronchogenic carcinoma is the most common malignancy associated with a pleural effusion.
${ }^{\text {- }}$ Drugs i.e hydralazine

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}
- The effusion can be clear fluid or bloody. Clear fluid can be transudate which occurs when factors influencing formation and reabsorption of fluid is altered usually by imbalances in hydrostatic pressure.exudate results from inflammation of bacterial products or tumours involving pleural surfaces. The abnormal accumulation in the pleural space cause pain and shortness of breath.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}
${ }^{-}$Usually the clinical manifestations are those caused by the underlying disease.
- Pneumonia causes fever, chills, and pleuritic chest pain, whereas a malignant effusion may result in dyspnea and coughing. The size of the effusion and the patient's underlying lung disease determine the severity of symptoms. A large pleural effusion causes shortness of breath.
- small to moderate pleural effusion is present, dyspnea may be absent or only minimal
${ }^{-}$Pleuritic chest pain
- Decreased or absent breath sound
${ }^{-}$Trachea deviation away from the affected side
${ }^{-}$Dull flat sound on percussion

\section*{Medical Management}

The objectives of treatment are to discover the underlying cause, to prevent reaccumulation of fluid, and to relieve discomfort, dyspnea, and respiratory compromise.
-Specific treatment is directed at the underlying cause .
If the pleural fluid is an exudate, more extensive diagnostic procedures are performed to determine the cause.
Thoracentesis is performed to remove fluid, to obtain a specimen for analysis, and to relieve dyspnea and respiratory compromise . insertion of a chest tube connected to a water-seal drainage system or suction to evacuate the pleural space and re-expand the lung.
surgical pleurectomy,

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT}
- Position patient in higher fowlers position for maximum gaseous and exchange Manage ABC
Assist patient in pain relief by assuming position that is least painful
- Auscultate for lung sounds and monitor for vital signs especially respirations
- If the patient is on chestube make sure it is not kinked and record amount of drainage

- Assist the patient in frequent turning and 06/14ããeracentesis procedure

\section*{EMPYEMA}
- is an accumulation of thick, purulent fluid within the pleural space, often with fibrin development and walled-off area where infection is located.

\section*{CAUSES}
- Most occur as complications of bacterial pneumonia or lung abscess.

Medical Management

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}
- Two general classes of asthma medications are
- quick-relief medications for immediate treatment of asthma symptoms and exacerbations i.e
Short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists, salbutamol Anticholinergics (eg, ipratropium bromide [Atrovent])
Direct muscle relaxant- aminophyline , oral/IV corticosteroids (hydrocortisone,predinisolo
ct

${ }^{-}$Reassure the patient to allay anxiety and to promote quick recovery
${ }^{-}$Ensure adequate fluid intake and nutrition
- On discharge teach the patient on common triggers of asthma and avoiding them, drug compliance, use of inhalor

\section*{STATUS ASTHMATICUS}
- is severe and persistent asthma that does not respond to conventional therapy. The attacks can last longer than 24 hours.
- Infection, anxiety, nebulizer abuse, dehydration, increased adrenergic blockage, and nonspecific irritants may contribute to these episodes.
- An acute episode may be precipitated by hypersensitivity to aspirin

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

${ }^{\text {- }}$ The patient's energy needs to be conserved by bed rest
${ }^{\bullet}$, the room should be quiet and free of respiratory irritants, including flowers, tobacco smoke, perfumes, or odors of cleaning agents.

\section*{Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease}
- (COPD) is a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible.
${ }^{-}$Pathophysiology
- airflow limitation is both progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious(harmful) particles or gases. The inflammatory response occurs throughout the airways, parenchyma, and pulmonary vasculature. Because of the chronic inflammation and the body's attempts to repair it, narrowing occurs in the small peripheral airways. Over time, this injury and repair process causes scar tissue formation and narrowing of the airway lumen.

CAUSES
- Exposure to cigarette smoke
- Chronic respiratory infections
- Process related to proteinases and antiproteinases in the lung
- Release of anti-inflamatory mediators
- Allergic reactions

\section*{Emphysema}
${ }^{-}$is a pathological term that describes an abnormal distention of the air spaces beyond the terminal bronchioles, with destruction of the walls of the alveoli and results in impaired gas exchange
- It is the end stage of a process that has progressed slowly for many years.
- As the walls of the alveoli are destroyed ,the alveolar surface area in direct contact with the pulmonary capillaries continually decreases, causing an increase in dead space and impaired oxygen diffusion, which leads to hypoxemia
- In the later stages of the disease, carbon dioxide elimination is impaired, resulting in hypercapnia and causing respiratory acidosis
- Aetiology
- It is as a result of smoking cigarette, inhalation of coal dust or alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency.

\section*{TYPES}
- panlobular (panacinar)
- there is destruction of the respiratory bronchiole, alveolar duct, and alveoli.. The patient with this type of emphysema typically has a hyperinflated(barrel )chest on physical examination, marked dyspnea on exertion, and weight loss.

CT
- centrilobular (centroacinar)
- pathologic changes take place mainly in the center of the secondary lobule, producing chronic hypoxemia, hypercapnia, polycythemia, and episodes of right-sided heart failure.
- This leads to central cyanosis, peripheral edema, and respiratory failure.

\section*{Risk Factors}
${ }^{-}$cigarette smoking. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoking.
- passive smoking
- a deficiency of alpha1 anti- trypsin, an enzyme inhibitor that protects the lung parenchyma from injury
${ }^{\bullet}$ prolonged exposure to occupational dust and chemical

- Chronic cough
- Sputum production
- Fatigue
- Wheezing

${ }^{-}$is a chronic, irreversible dilation of the bronchi and bronchioles

\section*{CAUSES}
- chronic Airway obstruction
- Diffuse airway injury
- Pulmonary infections and obstruction of the bronchus or complications of long-term pulmonary infections
- Genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis
- Abnormal host defense (eg, ciliary dyskinesia or humoral immunodeficiency)
- Idiopathic causes

\section*{CAUSES CNT}
- Inflammatory-Infective process like measles, whooping cough, klebsiella pneumonia, may damage and weaken the bronchial wall resulting in dilatation and cilia damage.
- Obstruction -Proximal obstruction due to foreign body or enlarged lymph nodes results in distal accumulation of secretions which can be infected and cause localized bronchioectasis.
- Congenital factors.
- -Kertageners syndrome (i.e. immotile cilia, transposition of viscera and sinusitis)
- -Immunoglobulin insufficiency. (Secretory Ig G)
- Permanent dilatation of the bronchi and destruction of bronchial elastic and muscular structures.
- It may be localized or generalized throughout the bronchial tree.
- There is impaired clearance of bronchial secretion with secondary bacterial infection

\section*{Predisposing factors}
- recurrent respiratory infections in early childhood, measles, influenza, tuberculosis immunodeficiency disorders.
- TYPES
- Cylindrical
- Cystic
- varicose

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- The inflammatory process associated with pulmonary infections damages the bronchial wall, causing a loss of its supporting structure and resulting in thick sputum that ultimately obstructs the bronchi.
- The walls become permanently distended and distorted, impairing mucociliary clearance.
This results in retained secretions and subsequent obstruction that cause the alveoli distal to the obstruction to collapse. . Inflammatory scarring or fibrosis replaces functioning lung tissue.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}
- chronic cough and the production of purulent sputum in copious amounts.
- hemoptysis.
- Clubbing of the fingers also is common because of respiratory insufficiency.
- repeated episodes of pulmonary infection.
- Abnormal chest sounds-Coarse crackles over affected
- Weight loss and fatigue

\section*{Investigations}
- -Radiology- chest x-ray, CT scan, bronchography
- -Sputum culture- common organisms found are staphylococcal aureas, Pseudomonas Aeriginosa and haemophilus influenza.
- -Other tests like serum Ig or sweat test.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment objectives are to promote bronchial drainage to clear excessive secretions from the affected portion of the lungs and to prevent or control infection.
${ }^{\text {e Postural drainage draining reduces the amount of }}$ secretions and the degree of infection.
Chest physiotherapy.
Â©Smoking cessation is important because smoking impairs bronchial drainage by paralyzing ciliary action, increasing bronchial secretions, and causing inflammation of the mucous membrane

\section*{ct}
- A year-round regimen of antibiotic agents may be prescribed, with different types of antibiotics at intervals.
${ }^{\bullet}$ Patients should be vaccinated against influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia.
${ }^{\bullet}$ Bronchodilators, which may be prescribed for patients who also have reactive airway disease, may also assist with secretion management.
- Surgical intervention, may be indicated for the patient who continues to expectorate large amounts of sputum and has repeated bouts of pneumonia and hemoptysis despite adhering to the treatment regimen.

\section*{Mngt summary}
${ }^{\bullet}$ Physiotherapy-chest percussion, forced expiratory maneuvers and postural drainage.
- Antibiotics -
${ }^{\bullet}$ Mild - cefactor 500 mg tds, augmentin, Amoxil, ampiclox e.t.c.

${ }^{\bullet}$ Right-ventricular failure.

\section*{CYSTIC FIBROSIS}
${ }^{-}$It is an inherited chronic disease that affect lung and digestive system
- A defective gene and its protein product cause the body to produce unusually thick mucus that clogs the lung.
- Usually diagnosed in early infancy or early childhood

\section*{Pathophysiology}
${ }^{-}$is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein, which is a chloride channel found in all exocrine tissues.
- Chloride transport problems lead to thick, viscous secretions in the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and reproductive tract as well as increased salt content in sweat gland secretions.
- Airflow obstruction is a key feature in the presentation of CF.
${ }^{\bullet}$ This obstruction is due to bronchial plugging by purulent secretions, bronchial wall thickening due to inflammation, and, over time, airway destruction.
${ }^{-}$These chronic retained secretions in the airways set up an excellent reservoir for continued bronchial infections.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}
- a productive cough
- wheezing
- hyperinflation of the lung fields on chest xray,
- pulmonary function test results consistent with obstructive airways.
- Upper respiratory manifestations of the disease include sinusitis and nasal polyps.

\section*{Medical Management}
control of infections is key in the treatment. Antibiotic medications are routinely prescribed and require multiple courses agents over long periods of time.
Bronchodilators are frequently administered to decrease airway obstruction.
- manual postural drainage and chest physical therapy, are used to enhance secretion clearance

\section*{ct}
- Inhaled mucolytic agents such as dornase alfa (Pulmozyme) or - (Mucomyst) may also be used to decrease the viscosity of the sputum and promote expectoration of secretions.
${ }^{-}$To decrease the inflammation and ongoing destruction of the airways, antiinflammatory agents may also be used. i.e inhaled corticosteroids or systemic therapy.
- Supplemental oxygen is used to treat the progressive hypoxemia

\section*{Nursing management}

\section*{LUNG CANCER (BRONCHOGENIC CARCINOMA}
${ }^{-}$affects primarily those in the sixth or seventh decade of life.
- In approximately 70\% of lung cancer patients, the disease has spread to regional lymphatic and other sites by the time of diagnosis.
- Evidence indicates that carcinoma tends to arise at sites of previous scarring (TB, fibrosis) in the lung.
- More than 85\% of lung cancers are caused by the inhalation of carcinogenic chemicals, most commonly cigarette smoke

\section*{CLASSIFICATION AND STAGING}
${ }^{\bullet}$ Most are classified as small cell lung cancer and non-small cell cancer.
- Non-small cell is further classified with cell types
- Squamous cell cancer usually centrally located and arises more in segmental and sub segmental bronchi
- Adenocarcinoma - most prevalent. occurs peripherally and often metastizes(undifferentiated)
- Large cell carcinoma- is a fast growing tumour that tend to arise peripherally(undifferentiated)
${ }^{\bullet}$ Bronchoalveolar found in terminal bronchi and alveoli and usually slow growing
- Small cell carcinoma arise in the major bronchi and spread by infiltration along the bronchial wall

\section*{staging}
- Staged according to tumour size, lymphoid involvement, location, and if metastized
- Non -small cell carcinoma is staged as
- Stage 1- cancer small and only in one area of the lung
- Stage 2\&3-tumour is larger and may have grown into the surrounding tissue and lymphnodes
- Stage IV-cancer has spread into the other body parts

Risk factors
- Tobacco smoke
- Passive smoking
- Environmental and occupational exposure i.e motor vehicle emissions and pollutant from manufacturing plants
- Chronic exposure to industrial carcinogens
- Family history
${ }^{\text {- }}$ Dietary factors i.e smokers who eat diet low in fruits and vegetables
- Underlying respiratory disease

\section*{Clinical manifestations}
${ }^{-}$It develops insidiously and asymptomatic until late in the course. they include
${ }^{-}$Chronic cough that starts as dry persistent to productive cough
- Dyspnea
- Haemoptysis
- Chest or shoulder pain indicate pleural involvement
${ }^{-}$Repeated unresolved URTI
- Wheezing due to bronchial obstruction
- Chest pain, tightness, hoarseness, dysphagia,neck edema and symptoms of pleural effusion if tumour has spread to adjacent structures
- Non specific symptoms- weakness, anorexia and weight loss

\section*{MEDICAL MANAGEMENT}
${ }^{-}$Treatment depend on the cell type, stage of the disease and physiologic status
- Surgical resection is the preferred method of treating patients with localized non-small cell tumors, no evidence of metastatic spread, and adequate cardiopulmonary function
- Radiation therapy may cure a small percentage of patients. It is useful in controlling neoplasms that cannot be surgically resected but are responsive to radiation. also may be used to reduce the size of a tumor, to make an inoperable tumor operable, or to relieve the pressure of the tumor on vital structures. It can control symptoms of spinal cord metastasis and superior vena caval compression
- Chemotherapy is used to alter tumor growth patterns, to treat patients with distant metastases or small cell cancer of the lung, and as an adjunct to surgery or radiation therapy
- Palliative therapy may include radiation therapy to shrink the tumor to provide pain relief, a variety of bronchoscopic interventions to open a narrowed bronchus or airway, and pain management and other comfort measures.
- Evaluation and referral to hospice is essential

\section*{Nursing management}
- RELIEVING BREATHING PROBLEMS
- Maintain airway patency through the removal of excess secretions. This may be accomplished through deepbreathing exercises, chest physiotherapy, directed cough, suctioning, and in some instances bronchoscopy.
- Bronchodilator medications prescribed to promote bronchial dilation.
supplemental oxygen to treat impaired gaseous exchange .
- Nursing measures focus on decreasing Dyspnea by encouraging the patient to assume positions that promote lung expansion, breathing exercises for lung expansion and relaxation, educate the patient on energy conservation and airway clearance techniques
ct
- Managing symptoms
- Administer strong analgesics i.e tramadol im, diclofenac,pethidine to relieve pain
- Position in a comfortable position to relieve pain i.e semi fowlers
${ }^{-}$Instruct patient and assess on the side effects of specific treatment and manage them promptly

\section*{Reducing fatique}
- Assess patient level of fatigue and identify treatable causes and validate with the patient that fatigue is a real symptom
- Educate the patient about energy conservation
technique and guided exercise as possible
- Refer to physical and occupational therapy as possible

\section*{Providing psychological support}
- Help patient and family deal with progress of disease and poor prognosis
- Assess psychological aspects and assist patient to cope with the disease process
- Assist patient and family with informed decision making regarding treatment options
- Support patient and family in end of life decision and treatment

\section*{CHEST TRAUMA}
- Two types-
- blunt and penetrating chest trauma
- BLUNT TRAUMA
- Results from sudden compression or pressure inflicted on the chest.

\section*{CAUSES}
- Motor vehicle crashes (trauma due to steering wheel, seat belt),
${ }^{-}$falls,
- bicycle crashes (trauma due to handlebars)

\section*{MECHANOSM OF BLUNT CHEST TRAUMA}
- Acceleration(moving object hitting the patient or patient being thrown into an object)
- Deceleration- sudden decrease in the rate of speed
- Shearing-stretching forces to the areas of the chest causing tears and raptures
- Compression-direct blow to the chest

\section*{PATHOLOGIC EFFECTS}
- Hypoxemia from disruption of the airway; injury to the lung parenchyma, rib cage, and respiratory musculature; massive hemorrhage; collapsed lung; and pneumothorax
- Hypovolemia from massive fluid loss from the great vessels, cardiac rupture, or hemothorax
- Cardiac failure from cardiac tamponade, cardiac contusion, or increased intrathoracic pressure

\section*{FLAIL CHEST}
- It usually occurs when three or more adjacent ribs (multiple contiguous ribs) are fractured at two or more sites, resulting in free floating rib segments.
${ }^{-}$It may also result as a combination fracture of ribs and costal cartilages or sternum .

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}
- During inspiration, as the chest expands, the detached part of the rib segment (flail segment) moves in a paradoxical manner movement, in that it is pulled inward during inspiration, reducing the amount of air that can be drawn into the lungs. On expiration, because the intrathoracic pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure, the flail segment bulges outward, impairing the patient's ability to exhale. The mediastinum then shifts back to the affected side. This paradoxical action results in increased dead space, a reduction in alveolar ventilation, and decreased compliance

Clinical manifestations
- hypoxemia, if gas exchange is greatly compromised,
- respiratory acidosis develops as a result of CO2 retention
- Hypotension, due to inadequate tissue perfusion,
- metabolic acidosis due paradoxical motion of the mediastinum decreases cardiac output.

\section*{Medical management}
- treatment of flail chest is usually supportive. Management includes providing ventilatory support, clearing secretions from the lungs, and controlling pain.
The specific management depends on the degree of respiratory dysfunction. If only a small segment of the chest is involved, the objectives are to clear the airway through positioning, coughing, deep breathing, and suctioning to aid in the expansion of the lung, and to relieve pain by intercostal nerve blocks.
${ }^{\text {F }}$ For mild to moderate flail chest injuries, the underlying pulmonary contusion is treated by monitoring fluid intake and appropriate fluid replacement, while at the same time relieving chest pain.
${ }^{-}$Pulmonary physiotherapy focusing on lung volume expansion and secretion management techniques are performed. The patient is closely monitored for further respiratory compromise.
When a severe flail chest injury is encountered, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation

\section*{ct}
-surgery may be required to more quickly stabilize the flail segment. This may be used in the patient who is difficult to ventilate or the high-risk patient with underlying lung disease who may be difficult to wean from mechanical
ventilation the patient is carefully monitored by serial chest x-rays, arterial blood gas analysis, pulse oximetry, and bedside pulmonary function monitoring.

\section*{Pulmonary Contusion}
- It is damage to the lung tissues resulting in hemorrhage and localized edema. It is associated with chest trauma when there is rapid compression and decompression to the chest wall

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}
- injury to the lung parenchyma and its capillary network results in a leakage of serum protein and plasma. The leaking serum protein exerts an osmotic pressure that enhances loss of fluid from the capillaries. Blood, edema, and cellular debris enter the lung and accumulate in the bronchioles and alveolar surface, where they interfere with gas exchange. An increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure occurs. The patient has hypoxemia and carbon dioxide retention.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}
- tachypnea, tachycardia, pleurisy chest pain, hypoxemia, and blood-tinged secretions,, crackles, frank bleeding, severe hypoxemia, and respiratory acidosis.
- patient with moderate pulmonary contusion has a large amount of mucus, serum, and frank blood in the tracheobronchial tree.
- A patient with severe pulmonary contusion has the signs and symptoms of ARDS; these may include central cyanosis, agitation, and productive cough with frothy, bloody secretions.

\section*{MEDICAL MANAGEMENT}
${ }^{\bullet}$ Treatment priorities include maintaining the airway, providing adequate oxygenation, and controlling pain.
- Supplemental oxygen is usually given by mask or cannula for 24 to 36 h .
- In mild pulmonary contusion, adequate hydration via intravenous fluids and oral intake is important to mobilize secretions. However, must be closely monitored to avoid hypervolemia.
- Volume expansion techniques, postural drainage, physiotherapy including coughing, and endotracheal suctioning are used to remove the secretions.
- Pain is managed by intercostal nerve blocks or by opioids.
${ }^{\bullet}$ antimicrobial therapy is administered because the damaged lung is susceptible to infection.
- moderate pulmonary contusion may require bronchoscopy to remove secretions; intubation and mechanical ventilation with PEEP may also be necessary to maintain the pressure and keep the lungs inflated.
- Diuretics may be given to reduce edema.
- A nasogastric tube is inserted to relieve gastrointestinal distention.
- severe contusion require aggressive treatment with endotracheal intubation and ventilatory support, diuretics, and fluid restriction. Colloids and crystalloid solutions may be used to treat ${ }^{42} \mathrm{H}^{25} \mathrm{v}$ povolemia.

\section*{PENETRATING TRAUMA}
- Occurs when a foreign object penetrates into the chest wall
- Causes
- Gun shot and stab wound
- Stab wounds are of low velocity and thus destroy small area
- Gunshot may be of low, medium or high velocity depending with distance
${ }^{\ominus}$, caliber of gun and bullet

\section*{Management}
- Objective management is to restore and maintain cardiopulmonary function
- Adequate airway and ventilation is established and maintained
- Assess for shock and treated simultaneously with colloid, crystacolloid solution or blood as indicated by patient condition
- Diagnostic investigations are done i.e chest x-ray, arterial blood gases, pulse oximetry and ECG, blood grouping and cross matching
- Chest tube inserted for pleural drainage
- Surgical intervention in penetrating wound of the heart, great vessels.

\section*{PNEUMOTHORAX}
- occurs when the parietal or visceral pleura is breached and the pleural space is exposed to positive atmospheric pressure.
- negative pressure is required to maintain lung inflation.
- When either pleura is breached, air enters the pleural space, and the lung or a portion of it collapses.
- Types of pneumothorax include simple, traumatic, and tension pneumothorax.

\section*{Simple(spontaneous) Pneumothorax}
- Most commonly this occurs as air enters the pleural space through the rupture of a bleb or a bronchopleural fistula.
- A spontaneous pneumothorax may occur in an apparently healthy person in the absence of trauma due to rupture of an airfilled bleb, or blister, on the surface of the lung,.
${ }^{-}$It may be associated with diffuse interstitial lung disease and severe emphysema.

\section*{Traumatic Pneumothorax}
${ }^{-}$occurs when air escapes from a laceration in the lung itself and enters the pleural space or enters the pleural space through a wound in the chest wall.

\section*{causes}
- blunt trauma (eg, rib fractures) or penetrating chest trauma.
${ }^{\text {- }}$ abdominal trauma (eg, stab wounds or gun- shot wounds to the abdomen) and from diaphragmatic tears.
- invasive thoracic procedures (ie, thoracentesis, transbronchial lung biopsy, insertion of subclavian line

\section*{ct}

Traumatic pneumothorax is often accompanied by
${ }^{\text {Ohemothorax }}$ (collection of blood in the pleural space resulting from torn intercostal vessels, lacerations of the great vessels, and lacerations of the lungs). hemopneumothorax Often both blood and air are found in the chest cavity.

\section*{ct}

Open pneumothorax. It occurs when a wound in the chest wall is large enough to allow air to pass freely in and out of the thoracic cavity with each attempted respiration.
Because the rush of air through the hole in the chest wall produces a sucking sound, such injuries are termed sucking chest wounds.
In such patients, not only does the lung collapse, but the structures of the mediastinum (heart and great vessels) also shift toward the uninjured side with each inspiration and in the opposite direction with expiration.
This is termed mediastinal flutter or swing, and it produces serious circulatory problems.

\section*{ct}
- Tension Pneumothorax
${ }^{\bullet}$ occurs when air is drawn into the pleural space from a lacerated lung or through a small hole in the chest wall.
- It may be a complication of other types of pneumothorax. air that enters the chest cavity with each inspiration is trapped; it cannot be expelled during expiration through the air passages or the hole in the chest wall.
- With each breath, tension (positive pressure) is increased within the affected pleural space.
${ }^{-}$This causes the lung to collapse and the heart, the great vessels, and the trachea to shift toward the unaffected side of the chest (mediastinal shift).
- Relief considered a medical emergency

Clinical Manifestations
- Simple pneumothorax
- Pain is usually sudden and may be pleuritic
- minimal respiratory distress with slight chest discomfort and tachypnea with a small simple or uncomplicated pneumothorax.
- largepneumothorax,
- acute respiratory distress.
- The patient is anxious,
- dyspnea and air hunger,

\section*{ct}
increased use of the accessory muscles, and may develop central cyanosis from severe hypoxemia
- tachypnea,
- decreased movement of the affected side of the thorax, a tympanic sound on percussion of the chest wall
- decreased or absent breath sounds and tactile fremitus on the affected side

Tension pneumothorax- air hunger, agitation, increasing hypoxemia, central cyanosis, hypotension, tachycardia, and profuse diaphoresis.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Sudden sharp chest pain
${ }^{-}$Cough
- Sudden shortness of breath with violent but futile respiratory effort
${ }^{-}$Fall in Bp
- Weak and rapid pulse
${ }^{\bullet}$ Hyper resonance on the affected side
- Apprehension
- Anxiety and restlessness
${ }^{\bullet}$ Diaphoresis (sweating profusely)
${ }^{-}$pallor or cyanosis
- faintness, feeling of tightness in chest
${ }^{-}$decreased or absent breath sounds over collapsed lung
${ }^{-}$cessation of normal chest movement of the affected side
- Open sucking wounds for open pneumothorax

\section*{Medical management}
- Management depends on its cause and severity.
- The goal of treatment is to evacuate the air or blood from the pleural space.
${ }^{-}$If a tension pneumothorax is suspected, the patient should
${ }^{-}$immediately be given a high concentration of supplemental oxygen to treat the hypoxemia, and pulse oximetry should be used to monitor oxygen saturation.
- In an emergency situation, a tension pneumothorax can be de- compressed or quickly converted to a simple pneumothorax by inserting a large-bore needle (14-gauge) at the second intercostal
${ }^{-}$space,

\section*{ct}
- chest tube is inserted to drain the fluid and air.
- Opiod analgesics administered to relieve chest pain
- Antibiotics usually are prescribed to combat infection from contamination.
- An emergency thoracotomy may also be performed in the emergency department if there is suggested cardiovascular injury

\section*{Nursing consideration}
- -If patient develops symptoms of pneumothorax
${ }^{-}$Remain with him and keep him as calm and quiet a possible
- Place him in a sitting position and encourage him to control the coughing
${ }^{\text {- }}$ Have another nurse notify the physician without causing alarm to patient.
- Prepare thoracocentesis equipment at the bedside
- Obtain arterial blood gases
- Administer $0_{2}$ to relieve dyspnoea if necessary
${ }^{\bullet}$ Evaluate pulse and resp. rates for indications of shock and respiratory distress.

- Chest drainage systems have a suction source, a collection chamber for pleural drainage, and a mechanism to prevent air from reentering the chest with inhalation.

\section*{types}
- Water Seal Chest Drainage Systems( wet suction)
- has three chambers: a collection chamber, a water seal chamber, and a wet suction control chamber.
- The collection chamber acts as a reservoir for fluid draining from the chest tube.
- It is graduated to permit easy measurement of drainage..
- The suction control chamber regulates the amount of negative pressure applied to the chest.
- The amount of suction is determined by the water level.
- It is generally set at $20-\mathrm{cm}$ water; adding more fluid results in more suction. After the suction is turned on, bubbling appears in the suction chamber..
- The water seal chamber has a one-way valve or water seal that prevents air from moving back into the chest.

\section*{ct}
- Dry Suction Water Seal Systems
- Water is not needed for suction as it is in the wet system
- the regulator dial allows the desired level of suction to be dialed
${ }^{\bullet}$ Dry Suction with a One-Way Valve System. This system has a collection chamber, a one-way mechanical valve, and a dry suction control chamber.
${ }^{-}$The valve acts in the same way as a water seal and permits air to leave the chest but prevents it from moving back into the pleural space.
${ }^{\text {- }}$ This model lacks a water seal chamber and therefore has the advantage of a system that operates without water.
${ }^{\bullet}$ useful for the patient who is ambulating or being transported.

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR MANAGING CHEST DRAINAGE SYSTEMS}

1- Verify that all connection tubes are patent and connected securely.
2 - Assess that the water seal is intact when using a wet suction system and assess the regulator dial in dry suction systems.
3 - Monitor characteristics of drainage including color, amount, and consistency. Assess for significant increases or decreases in drainage output.
4- Note fluctuations in the water seal chamber for wet suction systems.
5- Keep system below the patient's chest level.
6 - Keep suction at level ordered.
7 - Maintain appropriate fluid in water seal for wet suction systems.

\section*{ct}
${ }^{\text {- }}$ 8. Ensure that the drainage tubing does not kink, loop, or interfere with the patient's movements.
- 9. Encourage the patient to assume a comfortable position with good body alignment.
- 10Assist patient with ROM exercises on the affected arm 11.Observe for air leaks in the drainage system; they are indicated by constant bubbling in the water seal chamber
- 12. Observe and immediately report rapid and shallow breathing, cyanosis,, symptoms of hemorrhage, or significant changes in vital signs.
13.Encourage and assist the patient to turn, cough, and take deep breaths.

\section*{ATELECTASIS}

Refers to closure or collapse of the alveoli may be acute or chronic in its onset PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The trapped alveolar air becomes absorbed into the bloodstream, but outside air cannot replace the absorbed air because of the blockage thus the isolated portion of the lung becomes airless and the alveoli collapse.
CAUSES:
$\checkmark$ retained secretions
$\checkmark$ pain
$\checkmark$ alterations in small airway function
$\checkmark$ prolonged supine positioning
increased abdominal pressure
$\checkmark$ reduced lung volumes due to musculoskeletal or neurologic disorders
$\checkmark$ specific surgical procedures (eg, upper abdominal,
thoracic, or open heart surgery)
$\checkmark$ Persistent low lung volumes, secretions or a mass obstructing or impeding airflow
$\checkmark$ Compression of lung tissue may all cause collapse or obstruction of the airways

The causes of atelectasis in postoperative patients
$\checkmark$ low tidal breathing- results from the effects of anesthesia or analgesic agents
$\checkmark$ supine positioning
$\checkmark$ retention of secretions,
$\checkmark$ airway obstruction
$\checkmark$ impaired cough reflex / reluctant to cough because ofpain.
$\checkmark$ Restriction of normal lung expansion on inspiration as a result of:
$\checkmark$ Pressure from-pleural effusion, pneumothorax or hemothorax.
$\checkmark$ Excassive sedation
- Cough
- sputum production
- low-grade fever
- Respiratory distress
- Dyspnea
- Tachycardia
- Tachypnea
- pleural pain
- central cyanosis

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
- Decreased breath sounds and crackles are heard over the affected area
- X-ray findings-Patchy infiltrates, consolidated areas
- Hypoxemia- by pulse oximetry(SpO2) may demonstrate a low saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen (less than $90 \%$ ) OR a lower-than-normal partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2).

\section*{PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT}

GOAL- to improve ventilation and remove secretions
- Frequent turning
- Frequent suctioning /nebulization
- Physiotherapy(postural drainage and chest percussion)
- Deep-breathing maneuvers (at least every 2 hours)- increases lung expansion minimizing airway closure
- Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation with e.g exniratory pressure or

\section*{TUBERCULOSIS}
- Infectious bacterial disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis an acid fast rod shaped bacillus.
- Most commonly develops as a:
$\checkmark$ pulmonary disease
$\checkmark$ Extra-pulmonary disease
MODES OF TRANSMISSION: Through aerosolized infected droplet nuclei by mainly coughing although laughing, talking, sneezing, singing and spitting can lead to contamination of droplets.
- The infectious patient is that person with a positive sputum smear.
- The leading cause of adult deaths worldwide
- Every year 1.6 million people die from TB

OTHER MYCOBACTERIA NOT ASSOCIATED WITH TB
MYCOBACTERIUM LEPRAE
- Lepromatous leprosy
- Tuberculoid leprosy

MYCOBACTERIUM AVIUM- INTERCELLULARE COMPLEX
- Asymptomatic colonization
- Pulmonary disease
- Disseminated disease in HIV Patients

OTHER MYCOBACTERIA
- Mycbacterium kansasi-pulmonary disease
- Mycobacterium ulcerans-cutaneous disease
- Anyone can develop disease
- Shortly after infection with the bacteria
- Many months to years after infection
- Reactivation of previous disease
- In the majority of persons infected with the tubercle bacilli the immune system is able to contain the infection and the bacilli remain dormant for the rest of a person's life and do not lead to disease

\section*{RISK FOR EXPOSURE}
- Duration of exposure/contact with infected cases important for healthcare workers or household contacts
- Concentration of infectious TB in the airinfluenced by:
$\checkmark$ Poor Ventilation
$\checkmark$ Poor Lighting
$\checkmark$ High number of infected patients normally in contact with the person -important in family/urban slums

\section*{RISK OF DEVELOPING DISEASE FOLLOWING INFECTION}
- Extremes of age
- Gender (less in females?)
- HIV infection
- Diabetes Mellitus
- Alcoholism
- Tobacco smoking
- Treatment with immunosuppressive agents.

\section*{CLASSIFICATIONS OF CLINICAL TB}
1. New Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) - patients who have never been treated before-(Smear positive PTB or category 1 patients)
2. Extra-Pulmonary Tuberculosis (category 2)- also placed in category 3 often smear negative
3. Previously treated smear positive PTB relapses or treatment failures or return after default (also called smear positive re-treatment cases) (category 3). These patients may have drug resistant TB.
- All smear positive re-treatment cases should have sputum TB culture and drug susceptibility testing to exclude drug resistance and especially multi-drug resistant TB.
4. Other re-treatment cases - smear negative PTB cases that have previously been treated or EPTB in a patient previously treated for TB.

\section*{PROGRESION OF PULMONARY TB}
i. Pneumonia like symptoms
ii. Granuloma formation with fibrosis
iii. Caseous necrosis
- Tissue becomes dry \& amorphous
- Mixture of protein \& fat (assimilated very slowly)
iv. Calcification-Ca++ salts deposited
v. Cavity formation-Center liquefies \& empties into bronchi
- The bacilli of TB infect the lung, forming a tubercle (lesion).
- The tubercle:
$\checkmark$ May heal, leaving scar tissue.
$\checkmark$ May continue as a granuloma, then heal, or be reactivated.
$\checkmark$ May eventually proceed to necrosis, liquefaction, sloughing, and cavitation.
- The initial lesion may disseminate tubercle bacilli to adjacent tissues through:
$\checkmark$ hematogenous spread
$\checkmark$ via the lymphatic system
$\checkmark$ through the bronchi.
- Extrapulmonary TB occurs more commonly in children and immunocompromised individuals often involving the lymph nodes, bones, joints, pleural space, pericardium, CNS, GU tissue, the peritoneum.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}
- Persistent cough(> 3 wks)
- Blood stained sputum
- Night sweats
- weight loss> $10 \%$
- chest pain
- shortness of breath
1.sputum test -The only means of establishing diagnois
- sputum TB culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST)-reserved for: the evaluation of all smear positive and negative PTB patients, who have failed initial treatment, relapsed or defaulters
2.The radiographic features suggestive of PTB - upper zone patchy shadows with evidence of cavitation and scarring (fibrosis).
- The chest x-ray- may aid the diagnosis of PTB but it should never be used as the sole means of establishing a TB diagnosis.

\section*{Ct diagnosis}
3.Raised ESR
4. Nucleic acid detection tests E.G Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) very sensitive and specific for TB
5. In HIV infected persons the radiological features include:
$\checkmark$ the lower or mid-zone shadows
$\checkmark$ the presence of hilar or mediastinal lymph node enlargement
$\checkmark$ Miliary mottling
$\checkmark$ pleural and/ or pericardial effusion
- Smear negative PTB should be diagnosed in patients with:
$\checkmark$ a cough of longer than two weeks
$\checkmark$ chest radiographic findings consistent with TB
$\checkmark$ at least three sputum smears negative for AFBs
$\checkmark$ lack of response to a trial of broad spectrum antimicrobials excluding fluoroquionolnes.

Differential diagnosis of PTB esp In a person presenting with a chronic cough and negative sputum smears
- include pneumonia especially Pneumocytis jirovecii
- lung abscess
- lung cancer
- sarcoidosis
- bronchiectasis.
- When the diagnosis of TB is in doubt the patient should be referred to the next level for appropriate evaluation.
- The presentation and diagnostic approach to extra-pulmonary TB will depend on site of disease.
- patients often present with Signs of severe disease
1.Tuberculous Pleural effusion and empyema with consequent pyopneumothorax.
CLINICAL FEATURES
$\checkmark$ chest pain
$\checkmark$ breathlessness
$\checkmark$ fever and night sweats.
$\checkmark$ Shifted cardiac apex

\section*{3. Tuberculous lymphadenopathy}
- Often unilateral commonly involving the cervical (neck) nodes
- painless and initially firm and discrete but eventually become fluctuant and matted together with eventual sinus formation and pus discharge.
4.Intracranial TB-tuberculous meningitis(TBM)

Onset is gradual with:
$\checkmark$ headache
$\checkmark$ vomiting
$\checkmark$ neck stiffness
$\checkmark$ cranial nerve palsies
$\checkmark$ Convulsions
$\checkmark$ loss of speech
$\checkmark$ loss of power in one or more limbs.
- If untreated TB meningitis leads to a gradual change in level of consciousness with eventual coma and death
diagnosis:
- clinical suspicion
- examination of cerebrospinal fluid-Usually the CSF has a high cell count (mainly lymphocytes), low sugar and high protein. The ZN stain is rarely positive (less than $10 \%)$ while TB culture yields poorly.
- brain CT- show basal enhancement

\section*{5.Intestinal TB and Tuberculous ascites}

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}
$\checkmark$ progressive vague abdominal pain
$\checkmark$ abdominal distension
$\checkmark$ vague abdominal mass with doughy feeling
$\checkmark$ Fever wasting
$\checkmark$ diarrhea -may alternate with constipation.

\section*{6.Miliary TB}
usually presents with gradual onset of fever
$\checkmark$ malaise
$\checkmark$ night sweats
$\checkmark$ Wasting
$\checkmark$ Patient has very little respiratory symptoms
$\checkmark$ The chest x-ray shows multiple small millet-sized nodular shadows.
- The diagnosis is often missed but can be confirmed through culture of blood, CSF, which may be positive for tubercle bacilli

GENERAL APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT OF TB
$1^{\text {st }}$ Priority: Administrative Controls
1. Early diagnosis and assessment of cases
- High index of suspicion if
-Persistent cough (eg. >3 weeks)
-Bloody sputum, night sweats, fever, weight loss
-HIV or immunocompromised patients
-Close or household contact of someone with TB
- Acid-fast bacilli smear positive (ideally, 3 samples)
- Diagnosis should be made quickly in an OPD
- Communicate results immediately
$2^{\text {nd }}$ Priority: Environmental Controls
- Maximize natural ventilation
- Control for direction of airflow
- Provide separate waiting area for TB patients

3rd Priority: Personal Protective Equipment
- Use of masks to cover nose and mouth
- health workers to use respirator masks or N-95 msks

\section*{PREVENTING TRANSMISSION}
- Screen suspected and confirmed TB cases promptly
- Educate on cough hygiene
- Separate patients suspected to have TB
- Investigate for TB and refer immediately
- Provide HIV Management Services
1. To cure patients and therefore prevent suffering and death from TB
2. To prevent long term complications of TB
3. To prevent relapse of the disease
4. To prevent transmission of the infection
5. To prevent the development of resistant tubercle bacilli
- currently most anti-TB drugs are available as tablets containing multiple drugs in Fixed Dose Combinations (FDC). There are five primary drugs used to treat TB: isoniazid (H), Rifampicin (R), Pyrazinamide (Z), Ethambutol (E) and Streptomycin (S)

\section*{DIRECT OBSERVED TREATMENT}
- Current strategy is through the Direct Observation of Treatment (DOT) where:
- treatment is promoted using a treatment supporter who is acceptable and accountable to the patient and to the health system.
- This treatment supporter could be health care worker, a family member or a community volunteer
- The DOT may take place at home, workplace, health facility or other convenient place agreeable to the patient, the treatment supporter and the health care system.

\section*{NOTE}
- All patients started on treatment in the health facility should be entered in the treatment register and patient's TB treatment card (and the patient appointment card)
- Patients on TB treatment should be monitored for clinical and bacteriologic response.
- For smear positive PTB patients a follow up sputum smear should be carried out at the completion of the intensive phase of treatment and at the end of treatment.
- Patients who have a positive smear at the end of the intensive phase should have the intensive phase extended for not more than one month and weekly sputum smears until these become negative at which point they should be switched to the continuation phase
- Patients who still have a positive smear at month 4 should be considered to have failed initial treatment and switched to the re-treatment regimen (2SRHZE/1HRZE/5RHE).

\section*{Currently TB treatment is standardized}
1. TB treatment in nomadic populations-TB manyattas.
- The re-treatment regimen for nomadic patients with relapse (R), treatment failure (F), or treatment resumed (TR), with active tuberculosis disease and who have a positive sputum smear or culture result however remains the same and is:
2SRHZE/4RHZE
- In general pregnancy should be avoided during antiTB treatment. However when it occurs all pregnant women with active TB should be treated with a full complement of anti-TB drugs.
BUT -1. If patient Is on Isoniazid, MUST be given Pyridoxine to avoid risk of infant's damage-nervous system.
2. Streptomycin should not used in pregnancy -may cause deafness in the infant-ototoxic
3.When treating drug resistant TB the aminoglycosides (kanamycin, amikacin and capreomycin) should not be used-ototoxic, nephrotoxic
4. the thioamides (ethionamide and prothionamide) should not be used in pregnancy-GI disturbance, hepatptoxic

\section*{TUBERCULOSIS IN CHILDREN}

The ultimate prevention of TB in children is through immunization with BCG
- Children usually have low organism numbers, rare cavitation thus often develop extra pulmonary TB(EPTB), and severe and disseminated TB compared to adults (e.g. miliary TB and TB meningitis)
- Treatment outcomes in children are generally good
- The management of all children with TB should be in line with the DOTS strategy
- As in adults anti-tuberculosis treatment is divided into two phases
- The intensive phase uses at least three

Drug

Isoniazid

Rifampicin

Pyrazinamide

Ethambutol*

Streptomycin

Daily dosage in mg/kg (maximum)
$5-10(300 \mathrm{mg})$
$10-20(600 \mathrm{mg})$
$25-40(2000 \mathrm{mg})$
$15-25(1200 \mathrm{mg})$
$15-20 \mathrm{mg}(1000 \mathrm{mg})$

The assessment should include:
$\checkmark$ symptom assessment
$\checkmark$ assessment of adherence
$\checkmark$ inquiry about any adverse events
$\checkmark$ weight measurement-adjust dose in case of weight gain
- A child who is not responding to TB treatment should be referred for further assessment and management.
- On commencing anti TB treatment, children usually demonstrate immune reconstitution syndrome
- Failure of treatment in confirmed TB

\section*{OTHER IMPORTANT CARE}
- Health education
- Nutritional Support for TB Patients
- Avoid / reduce amount of Alcohol and Tobacco during Treatment for TB Alcohol is injurious to the liver

MAJOR CAUSE-non-adherence to treatment-:
- by governments-failure to provide political support and stewardship in the fight against TB
- by health care providers through failure to prescribe efficacious regimens for the treatment of TB
- by patients through failure to adhere to the prescribed treatment until it is completed.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF RESISTANCE}
1. Primary if there is definitely no previous treatment
2. Initial when previous treatment cannot definitely be excluded
3. Acquired if there is a definite history of previous treatment
- MONO DRUG RESISTANCE-Mycobacterium resistant to one first line antituberculous drug
- POLY DRUG RESISTANT TB(PDR TB)Mycobacterium resistant to more than one first line other than rifampicin and isoniazid
- MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT TB-(MDR TB)Mycobacterium resistant to atleast Isoniazid and Rifampicin
- EXTENSILY DRUG RESISTANT TB (XDR-TB)- Due to MDR TB resistant toany fluoroquinolones and atleast one injectable agent(Amikacin, kanamyci, capreomycin)
- NB-Both pulmonary and extra pulmonary and PTB may be drug resistant

KENYA DRUG REGIMEN FOR TREATING MDRTB
An intensive phase-lasting 6 months in which an injectable will be used under strict DOT and preferably in hospital.
Atleat five drugs must be used
i. Pyrazinamide: This drug is chosen because it is thought that the M.tb bacilli retain some susceptibility to it
ii. Ethionamide.
iii. Capreomycin is chosen because the aminoglycosides (Kanamycin and Amikacin) have been available for a long time in Kenya and have been extensively used for treating non-tuberculous infertions
iv) Cycloserine.
v) Ofloxacin.

NB Ethambutol will be used only in those patients where susceptibility to the drug is confirmed by DST. If resistance to this drug is present, PAS will be used instead

Continuation phase - for 18 months after culture conversion and should be administered as DOT on an ambulatory basis consisting of:
i. Ofloxacin.
ii. Cycloserine.
iii. Ethionamide.
iv. Pyrazinamide or PAS

\section*{TREATMENT MONITORING}
- During the intensive phase patients should be seen daily
NOTE
$\checkmark$ Take daily temperature, pulse and respiratory rate
$\checkmark$ weight monitoring be done weekly.
$\checkmark$ Appearance of adverse events should be recorded and the event categorized whether mild, moderate or severe

\section*{IMPORTANT ADVERSE EFFECTS}
-Anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions
-Electrolyte abnormalities especially hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia
- Gastrointestinal disturbances
- Headaches,seizures, depression

-Peripheral neuropathy

MANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE EFFECTSdepends on severity of symptoms
- Treatment withdrawal
- Counteracting the adverse event with another drug e.g. an anti-emetic for vomiting
- Drug dose reduction.

NB: All adverse events irrespective of the severity must be recorded in the patient record card.

\section*{TB TREATMENT OUTCOMES}
1. Cured (C): This is a tuberculosis patient who was initially sputum-smear positive and has a negative sputum smear at the end of treatment.
2. Treatment completed (TC): This is a tuberculosis patient who has completed his treatment as required but has not had a sputum smear-examination done at the end of treatment.
3. Out of control (OOC): A tuberculosis patient who has not attended two consecutive clinics and all efforts to find him/her and bring him/her back to treatment have failed.
4. Transferred out (TO): A patient who is transferred to continue treatment in another district and whose treatment outcome is therefore unknown at the initial treatment facility.
5. Failure (F): A tuberculosis patient who is still sputum smear-positive after $4 / 5$ or 6/8 months of treatment.

\section*{RESPIRATORY FAILURE}

Is an alteration in the function of the respiratory system that causes
- the partial pressure of arterial oxygen ( $\mathrm{Pao}_{2}$ ) to fall below 50 mm Hg (hypoxemia)
- the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide ( $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ ) to rise above 50 mm Hg (hypercapnia
May be acute, chronic, or combined

\section*{ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE}
- Characterized by hypoxemia ( $\mathrm{Pao}_{2}$ less than 50 mm Hg ) and/or hypercapnia ( $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ greater than 50 mm Hg ) and acidemia (pH less than 7.35).
- Occurs rapidly, usually in minutes to hours or days.

\section*{CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE}
- Characterized by hypoxemia (decreased $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ ) and/or hypercapnia (increased $\mathrm{PaCo}_{2}$ ) with a normal pH (7.35 to 7.45).
- Occurs over a period of months to year-
1.There is oxygenation Failure i.e. inability to adequately oxygenate the blood often associated with damage to the alveolarcapillary membrane which slows /prevents movement of oxygen from the alveoli to the pulmonary capillary blood
There is severe ventilation-perfusion imbalance
CAUSES
- Cardiogenic pulmonary edema (left ventricular failure; mitral stenosis)
- shock of any etiology
- Trauma e.g fat emboli, head injury, lung contusion
2. Ventilatory Failure with Normal LungsCharacterized by a decrease in $\mathrm{Pao}_{2}$, increase in $\mathrm{Paco}_{2}$, and a decrease in pH
-Primary problem is not the lungs.
CAUSE
-Insufficient respiratory center activity -due to drug intoxication, such as opioid overdose, general anesthesia
- vascular disorders, such as cerebral vascular insufficiency
-brain tumor
-Trauma- head injury
-Insufficient chest wall function (neuromuscular disease, such as Guillain-Barre, myasthenia gravis, trauma to the chest wall resulting in multiple fractures; spinal cord trauma; kyphoscoliosis).
3. Ventilatory Failure with Intrinsic Lung Disease (abnormal lungs)
- Characterized by a decrease in $\mathrm{Pao}_{2}$ and decreased pH due to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ retention as a result of damage to the lung parenchyma and/or airway obstruction

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
- BGA-show changes in $\mathrm{Pao}_{2}, \mathrm{Paco}_{2}$, and pH
- Pulse oximetry -decreasing $\mathrm{Sao}_{2}$.
- End tidal $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ monitoring-elevated.

MANAGEMENT
- Oxygen therapy to correct the hypoxemia.
- Chest physical therapy and hydration to mobilize secretions.
- Bronchodilators - reduce bronchospasm
- Steroids to reduce inflammation.
- Diuretics for pulmonary congestion.
- Mechanical ventilation
