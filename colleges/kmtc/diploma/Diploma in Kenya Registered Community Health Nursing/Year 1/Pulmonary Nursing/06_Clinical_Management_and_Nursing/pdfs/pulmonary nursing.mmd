\section*{MAJOR SYMPTOMS OF RESPIRATORY DISEASES}

\section*{DYSPNEA}
- Difficulty in breathing or labored breathing or shortness of Breath.
- Is a symptom common to many pulmonary and cardiac disorders, particularly when there is decreased lung compoliance or increased airueay resistance. E.g in asthma
- It may also be associated weith neurologic or neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis and Guillain-Barré syndrome

\section*{Clinical Significance}
- Acute diseases of the lungs produce a more severe grade of dyspnea than chronic diseases.
- Sudden dyspnea in a healthy person may indicate pneumothorax, acute respiratory obstruction, or Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).
- In immobilized patients, sudden dyspnea may denote pulmonary embolism.
- Orthopnea may be found in patients weith heart disease and occasionally in patients with COPD;
- dyspnea with an expiratory wheeze occurs with COPD.

\section*{COUGH}
- Results from irritation of the mucous membranes anywhere in the respiratory tract. by smoke, dust, or a gas.
- Cough is the chief protection mechanism against the accumulation of secretions in the bronchi and Bronchioles.

Clinical Significance.
- Cough may indicate serious pulmonary disease.
- Described as dry, hacking, productive or severe.
- A dry, irritative cough is characteristic of an upper respiratory tract infection

\section*{Cont..}
- Infection of viral origin causes an irritative, highpitched cough.
- Pleuritic chest pain accompanying coughing may indicate pleural incolvement.
- Cough in the morning weith sputum indicate Bronchitis
- Cough after food may indicate aspoiration in the tracheal bronchial tree

\section*{SPUJUM PRODUCTION}
- Sputum production is the reaction of the lungs to any constantly recurring irritant.

\section*{Clinical Significance}
- A profuse amount of purulent sputum or a change in color of the sputum probably indicates a bacterial infection.
- Thin, mucoid sputum Prequently results Prom wiral Bronchitis.
- Foul smelling sputum indicate indicate lung abcess or bronchiectasis

\section*{CHEST PAIN}
- May be associated with pulmonary or cardiac disease.
- Chest pain associated with pulmonary conditions may be sharr, stabbing, and intermittent, or it may be dull, aching, and persistent.
- The pain usually is pelt on the side where the pathologic process is located, but it may be referred elsewhere-for example, to the neck, back, or abdomen.

\section*{Clinical Significance.}
- Chest pain may occur with pneumonia, pulmonary embolism with lung infarction, and pleurisy.
- Pleuritic pain is sharp and intensily on inspiration.

\section*{WHEEWING -}
- is often the major finding in a patient weith bronchoconstriction or airway narrowing.
- It is a high-pitched, musical sound heard mainly on exporation. Common in asthma
- Relief Measures: Oral or inhalant Bronchodilator medications reverse wheezing in most instances.

\section*{CLUBBING OF THE FINGERS -}
- Is a sign of lung disease found in patients weith chronic hypoxic conditions, chronic lung infections, and malignancies of the lung.
- Manifested initially as loss of the nail bed angle

\section*{HEMOPTYSIS}
- Is the expectoration of blood from the respiratory tract
- is a common symptom of pulmonary and cardiac disorders

The most common causes are:
- Pulmonary infection
- Carcinoma of the lung
- Abnormalities of the heart or blood wessels
- Pulmonary emboli and infarction
- Chest trauma

\section*{CyANOSIS}
- Is a wery late indicator of hypoxia (oxygen deficiency in body tissues).
- The presence or absence of cyanosis is determined by the amount of unoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood.
Tues types:
- Central cyanosis is assessed by observing the color of the tongue and lips.
- Peripheral cyanosis results from decreased blood floue to a certain area of the body (e.g extremities)

\section*{DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES}
1. History and physical exam
2. Pulmonary Function Jests (PFJS)
- Are routinely used in patients with chronic respiratory disorders.
- Performed to assess respiratory function and to determine the extent of dysfunction. Such tests include measurements of lung wolumes, wentilatory function, and the mechanics of breathing, diffusion, and gas exchange.
- DFTs are useful in a patient with an established respiratory disease and assessing the response to therapy.

\section*{3. Arterial Blood Gases (ABSS)}
- Involves measurements of blood pH and of arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions.
- Arterial blood gas studies aid in assessing the ability of the lungs to provide adequate oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.
- Also involves the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb or excrete bicarbonate ions to maintain normal body pH.

\section*{4. Pulse Oximetry (SPO2)}
- Pulse oximetry is a method of continuously monitoring the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin
- A probe or sensor is attached to the fingertip, earlobe, or bridge of the nose.
- Normal Sp02 walues are 95\% to 100\%. Values less than 85\% indicate that the tissues are not receiving enough oxygen, and the patient needs further evaluation.

\section*{5. Sputum Studies}
- Sputum is obtained for analysis to identify pathogenic organisms and to determine whether malignant cells are present.
- It also may be used to assess for hypersensitivity states
- In general, sputum cultures are used in diagnosis, for drug sensitivity testing, and to guide treatment

\section*{6. Imaging Studies}
- This include x-rays, CT, MRI, Contrast studies, pulmonary angiography etc

\section*{7. Endoscopic Procedures}
- Bronchoscopy is the direct inspection and examination of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi using a bronchoscope
- Thoracoscopy is a diagnostic procedure in which the pleural cauity is examined wiith an endoscope. It is primarily indicated in the diagnostic evaluation of pleural effusions and pleural disease

\section*{8. Thoracentesis -}
- Aspiration of Pluid Prom the chest by centesis for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes
- (centesis is the act of puncturing a body cauity or organ with a hollow needle in order to draw out Pluid)

\section*{9. Biopsy}
- The excision of a small amount of tissue, may be performed to permit examination of cells Prom the pharynx, larynx, and nasal passages.

PNEUMONIA

Definition: Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lung parenchyma (the cells and tissues concerned with lung Punctions), caused by various microorganisms, including bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and eiruses.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF PNEUMONIA}

Pneumonia is classilied according to:
i) The predisposing eneironment.
ii) The pattern of damage executed in the lungs.

\section*{Classification of preumonia according to the predisposing endironment:}
i) Community acquired pneumonia
ii) Hospital acquired pneumonia
iii) Pneumonia in the immunocompromised patient
iue) Aspiration pneumonia

\section*{1. COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA (CAP)}
- Is pneumonia occurring in the community setting or weithin the first 48 hours after hospitalization
- The causative agents for CAP that requires hospitalization include Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Legionella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Mycoptasma pneumonia .
- This pneumonia may occur as lobar or as Bronchopneumonia in patients of any age and may Polloue a recent respiratory illness.
- S. pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the most common cause of CAP in people younger than 60 years of age weithout co-morbidity, and in those 60 years and older with co-morbidity.
- Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in infants and children but are relatively uncommon causes of CAP in adults.

\section*{2. HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA (HAP)}
- HAP, also known as nosocomial pneumonia, is defined as the onset of preumonia symptoms more than 48 hours after hospital admission in patients with no evidence of infection at the time of admission.
- It is the most lethal nosocomial infection and is the leading cause of death in patients with such infections.

\section*{Predisposing factors to hospital-acquired preumonia:}
i) Impaired host delenses (malnutrition, immunocompromised patients are at particular risk).
ii) Co-morbid conditions (e.g. metabolic disorders e.g Diabetes, sewere acute or chronic illnesses).
iii) Prolonged hospitalization (transmission of pathogens by the hands of health care personnel).
vi) Intervention-related factors also may play a role in the development of HAP:
- Prolonged or inappropriate use of antibiotics.
- Use of nasogastric tubes.
- Endotracheal intubation.

Common causative organisms for HAP include $\mathcal{E}$. coli, H. influenzae, Klebsiella species, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-sensitive or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) , and S. preumoniae.

\section*{3. PJEUNOJLA IN THE IJINUUNOCOJTPROJTISED HOST}

Occurs due to:
i) Prolonged use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents.
ii) Chemotherapy.
iii) Nutritional depletion.
iie) Prolonged use of broad spectrum antibiotics.
e) Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
vi) Genetic immune disorders.
wii) Long-term advanced life-support technology (mechanical wentilation).
- Pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts includes Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), Pungal pneumonias etc
- The organisms responsible for CAP and HAP can also cause pneumonia in the immunocompromised hosts.
- PCP is rarely observed in immunocompetent hosts and is often an initial AIDS-defining complication.
4. ASPIRATION PREUMONIA
- Aspiration pneumonia refers to the pulmonary consequences resulting from entry of endogenous or exogenous substances into the lower airway.
- Aspiration pneumonia can occur in the community or in the hospital setting.

\section*{Forms of aspiration pneumonia include:}
i) Aspiration of bacteria that reside in the upper airways, leading to infection. Common pathogens are S. preumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. aureus.
ii) Substances other than bacteria aspirated into the lungs, such as gastric contents
- These substances impair lung defenses, cause inflammatory changes, and lead to bacterial grouth resulting in preumonia.

\section*{Classification of pneumonia according to the pattern of damage executed in the lungs:}
i) Lobar pneumonia: Refers to the pneumonia in which a substantial portion of one or more lobes of the lungs is incolled.
ii) Bronchopneumonia: The disease is distributed in a patchy Pashion, originating Prom one or more localized areas within the bronchi and extending to the adjacent surrounding lung parenchyma. (lung tissue)

\section*{LOBAR PNEUMONIA ws BRONCHOPNEUMONIA}

\section*{Lobar pneumonia}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_14_ffa9e6a5e4c0b732d9b5g-046.jpg?height=1138&width=1987&top_left_y=352&top_left_x=621)

In lobar pneumonia, an entire lobe is consolidated, while in bronchopneumonia, patchy areas of consolidation occur.

\section*{RISK FACTORS TO PNEUMONIA}
1. Conditions that produce mucus or Bronchial obstruction and interfere with normal lung drainage (eg, cancer, cigarette smoking and COPD).
2. Immunosuppression
3. Cigarette smoking; cigarette smoke disrupts both mucociliary and macrophage activity.
4. Prolonged immobility
5. Subsequent placement of nasogastric or endotracheal tubes.
6. Depressed cough rellex (eg, in weak respiratory muscles);
7. Aspiration of foreign material into the lungs during periods of unconsciousness (head injury, anesthesia, altered level of consciousness), or abnormal suealloueing mechanism.
8. Alcohol intoxication: Alcohol suppresses the body's rellexes leading to aspiration. It also decreases tracheobronchial ciliary motion.
9. Advanced age, because of possible depressed cough and glottic rellexes and nutritional depletion.

\section*{10. Respiratory therapy with improperly sterilized equipment. \\ 11. Transmission of organisms from health care providers.}

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF PNEUMONIA}
- Preumonia is an inflammation of the lung parenchyma caused by earious microorganisms (bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and wiruses), most common being $S$. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, $S$. aureus, and Dneumocystis jirollecii.
- It arises from normal Plora present in patients with altered immunity or from aspiration of flora present in the oropharynx due to acute or chronic underlying disease that impairs host defenses.
- Preumonia may also result from bloodborne organisms that enter the pulmonary circulation and are trapped in the pulmonary capillary bed.
- The inveasion of lung tissues with bacteria and eiruses alfects gaseous exchange, through an inflammatory reaction that occur in the bronchi and in the alleeoli causing formation of inflammatory exudate.
- White blood cells, mostly neutrophils, migrate into the alweoli and pill the normally air-pilled spaces. The mucosal edema and the exudate (secretions) causes partial occlusion of the bronchi and the alweoli. The exudate also interferes with the diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.
- All these results in poor wentilation of the lung parenchyma
- Bronchial exudate production leads to mucoid or mucopurulent sputum production while the airway irritation causes reflex coughing.
- As a compensatory mechanism to tissue hypoperfusion, breath rates increases to between 25 and $45 \mathrm{~b} / \mathrm{min}$, causing shortness of breath
- With improper or delayed treatment, pneumonia can complicate to pleural elfusion, hypotension, shock and respiratory Pailure.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF PNEUMONIA}
- Shaking chills
- Fever
- Dry cough
- Muscle aches
- Nausea/leomiting
- Rapid breathing
- Rapid heartbeat
- Difficulty Breathing
- Chest pain

\section*{ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES}
i) Patient history: positive history of a recent respiratory tract infection.
ii) Physical examination: reveals percussion dullness; crackles on auscultation reveals Pluid in narroue airueays.
iii) Chest x-rays: reveals areas of opacity which represent lung tissue consolidation.
iv) Blood culture to reveal bacteremia.
v) Pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas analysis is used to determine the patient's oxygenation and acid-base status.
oi) Sputum examination (for microscopy or culture). wii) Bronchoscopy may reveal narrow inflamed and exudate-filled bronchials.

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF PMEUMONIA PHARTNACOTHERAPY}

\section*{Antibiotic therapy}
i) Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin)
ii) Beta-lactam agent (cefpodoxime or cefuroxime)
iii) Fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, or levolloxacin)
ie) Aminoglycosides
u) In HAP or nosocomial preumonia with no known multidrug resistance, monotherapy with ceftriaxone, or with lewolloxacin is used.

\section*{Other management}
i) Hydration (with oral Pluids or intravenously if patient is NPO)
ii) Antipyretics (paracetamol) are used to treat headache and Pewer.
iii) Antitussive medications (codeine or dextromethorphan) are used for the associated cough.
ine) Bed rest is prescribed until the infection shouls signs of clearing.
w) Oxygen is administered if hypoxemia develops.

\section*{vi) Improving Airueay Patency:}
$\checkmark$ The nurse encourages hydration (2 to $3 \mathcal{L} /$ day), because adequate hydration thins and loosens pulmonary secretions.
$\checkmark$ Coughing can be initiated either coluntarily or by reflex. The nurse encourages the patient to perform an effective, directed cough
$\checkmark$ Chest physiotherapy (percussion) is important in loosening and mobilizing secretions.

\section*{oii) Oxygen administration}

Administer oxygen therapy as prescribed.
oilii) Promote rest and conserve patient energy
Place the patient in a comportable position to promote rest and breathing (eg, semi-Pouler's position)
ix) Maintaining adequate nutrition
x) Promoting patients' and Pamily knouledge on preumonia.
xi) Monitoring and managing potential compotications, such as shock, pleural epfusion, confusion and respiratory Pailure.

\section*{prevention OF pneumonia}
-Don't smoke.
$>$ Practice good hygiene.
- Stay rested and Pit.
- Appropriately treating underlying illnesses (such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition) can decrease the risk of pneumonia.
-Pneumonia Vaccination. (pneumococcal vaccine)

\section*{complicasiONs}
- Bacteria in the bloodstream (bacteremia)
$>$ Lung abscess.
- Build up of Pluid in the space between the lung and chest wall (rleural effusion).
$>$ Difficulty breathing.
-Shock and respiratory Pailure
-Septic arthritis
$>$ Endocarditis

P\&EURIS y

\section*{InTRODUCTION}
- Definition: Pleurisy is the Inflammation of the pleura of the lungs (especially the parietal layer)
- It is most often caused by a oiral infection.
- Various other lung disorders can also cause a 'pleuritic pain' similar to pleurisy.
- A pleuritic pain is a chest pain which is typically sharp and 'stabbing' in a part of the chest. The pain is usually made worse when breathing in or coughing.

\section*{A}
- Pleura are thin serous membrane around the lungs and inner walls of the chest. There are two layers.
- One layer lines the inside of the chest wall. The other layer covers the lungs.
- Between the two layers of pleura (the pleural cadity) , is a serous Pluid called pleural Pluid.
- This helps the lungs and chest wall to move smoothly when breathing.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_14_ffa9e6a5e4c0b732d9b5g-065.jpg?height=1932&width=2653&top_left_y=89&top_left_x=10)

\section*{SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS}
- Pain on one side of the chest (unilateral)
- Pain in the shoulders and back (referred pain)
- Shallour breathing to acooid Peeling pain
- Headaches
- Joint pain
- Muscle aches
- Shortness of breath
- Intercostal tenderness on palpation.
- Evidence of infection; Pever, malaise, increased white cell count

\section*{CAUSES}
- Bacterial infections such as pneumonia and tuberculosis
- A chest wound that punctures the pleural cavity
- A pleural tumor
- Lung cancer
- Autoimmune disorders, like rheumatoid arthritis
- Pulmonary embolism
- A heart surgery complication
- A fungal or parasitic infection of pleura
- Complication of thoracotomy procedure
(thoracotomy - is a surgical incision into the chest wealls opening up the pleural causity)

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
- Chest x-ray
- Blood test
- Thoracentesis - Removal of fluid from the chest by centesis for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Centesis is the act of puncturing a body cauity or organ with a hollow needle in order to drawe out Pluid
- Ct-scan
- Ultrasound
- Biopsy
- Thoracoscopy

\section*{Management}
- The objectives of treatment are to discover the underlying cause and to relieve the pain.
- Treatment for the underlying primary disease (e.g pneumonia)
- Inflammation of pleura usually resolves when the primary disease subsides
- Antibiotics Por bacterial infection
- Antiinflammatory drugs including aspirin, ibuprofen etc
- Prescription of pain and cough medication to promote comport.
- Medications to clear any blood clots e.g herarin
- Large collections of pus is then drained out via a tube (chest tube)
- Bronchodilators wia metered dose inhaler (MDI) devices, such as those used to treat asthma. E.g salbutamol
- Elealuate patient for signs of hypoxia

\section*{Easing Painful Respiration}
- Assist patient to find comportable position that will promote respiration; lying on affected side decreases stretching of the pleura and, therefore, the pain decreases.
- Instruct patient on sptinting the chest while taking a deep breath or coughing
- Administer pair medications as prescribed.
- Assist weith intercostal nerve block iP indicated.

\section*{compliCaTIONS}
- Severe pleural elfusion.
- Atelectasis (Collarse of an expanded lung)

- Cyanosis: Hypoxia
- Unequal chest inflation: Pneumothorax or Flail chest?
- Bruising or contusion: Seat-Belt' sign.
- Penetrating chest injury
- Distended neck weins: wenous return or cardiac tamponade **(cantiac ctamponade: Mechanical compression of the heart resulting from large amounts of fluid collecting in the previcardial space and limiting the heart's normal range of motion)

\section*{LISTEN}
- Absent breath sounds: Apnoea or tension pneumothorax
- Noisy breathing/Crepitations/Stridor/Wheeze: Partially obstructed airueay
- Reduced air entry: Pneumothorax, Haemothorax, Heamopnemothorax, Plail chest

\section*{FEES}
- Tracheal deneitation
- Tenderness: Chest wall contusion and/rib Practure

\section*{1. Rib Practure}
- $1^{\text {st }}$ and 2 nd ribs are protected by claivicle: when Practured it could be life threatening as trauma to the thoracic aorta, brachial plexus or subclaeian wein is likely.
- $11^{\text {th }}$ and $12^{\text {th }}$ ribs are floating ribs, usually not Practured
- Ribs in children are more elastic thus great Porce is needed to cause Practures

\section*{Types of trauma \\ a) CLOSED INJURY TO THE CHEST}
$\checkmark$ Direct trauma - Single or multiple ribs Practured at the point of contact
$\checkmark$ Crush injury - Usually causes Plail chest due to multiple sites of Practure of ribs (Flail chest: Loss of stability of chest weall as a result of multipote rib Practures)
$\checkmark$ Steering wheel injury - Common in head-on-collision accidents where fracture of sternum and bilateral Practures of ribs occur at costochondral junction
$\checkmark$ Minor trauma - In osteoporotic ribs, sometimes even a cough can cause a rib Practure

\section*{Clinical Peatures}
- In rib Practure without compotication: Pain while taking a deep breath and exaggerated pain during coughing
- Inspection: Bruising on skin
- Palpation: Bony irregularity, Tenderness and Crepitus
- X-ray usually shous a Practure rib but may miss a hairline Practure (tiny Practures)

\section*{Manangement of uncompticated rib Practure}
- Reduction of pain with 2 week polloue up
- Analgesics:
-Opiods
-NSAID's
- Strapping of chest: relieves pain by immobilizing the ribs
- Breathing exercises

\section*{2. Flail Chest}
- Definition: Loss of stability of chest weall as a result of multiple rib Practures
- "A flail chest segment is formed when turo or more consecutive ribs, with each rib being Practured at tue or more sites ${ }^{32}$
- Stowe-in-chest: "Depression of a portion of the chest wall due to severe chest injury, which contributes to forming a Plail segment."

\section*{Complications}
- The early mortality attributable to the Plail chest syndrome is due to:
- Massive haemothorax and Pulmonary contusion
- Whereas late mortality is largely due to:
- Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and associated infections.

\section*{Investigations}
1. Utital signs
2.Chest X-Ray
3. ECG
4.Pulse oximetry
5. Arterial Blood Gas
6. Fluid monitoring: urinary catheterization

- Minimise Purther lung injury (immobility)
- Secure and support the airueay as indicated
- Analgesia
- Mechanical ventilation
- Administration of humidified oxygen
- Monitor SP02
- Secure one or more I.V. lines for Pluid replacement (cautious Pluid resuscitation)

\section*{PNEUMOTHORAX}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_14_ffa9e6a5e4c0b732d9b5g-094.jpg?height=1127&width=1696&top_left_y=917&top_left_x=369)
- Definition1:Abnormal presence of air in the pleural caleity resulting in the collapse of the lung.
- Definition 1: A pneumothorax is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall

\section*{Mechanism:}
- In normal people, the pressure in pleural space is negative during the entire respiratory cycle.
- Tue opposite Porces result in negative pressure in pleural space.
(outward pull of the chest wall and elastic recoil of the lung)
- The negative pressure will disappear if any communication (space) develops.
- When a space develops between an ablueolus and pleural space, air weill flow into the pleural space until there is no longer a pressure difference or until the space is sealed.

\section*{Types of pneumothoraces}

\section*{i) Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (PSP)}
- A primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) tends to occur in young adults without underlying lung problems, and usually causes limited symptoms.
- Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting Peatures

\section*{ii) Secondary Spontaneous Pneumothoraces (SSPS)}
- Occur in individuals wiith significant underlying lung disease.
- Symptoms tend to be more severe than in PSP, as the unalpected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs.
- Hyroxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is manifested as cyanosis (blue discoloration of the lips and skin).

\section*{iii) Traumatic Pneumothorax}
- Traumatic pneumothorax most commonly occurs when the chest wall is pierced, such as when a stab wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the pleural space, or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises the integrity of the incolleed structures.

\section*{Tension Pneumothorax}
- Generally presents when a pneumothorax (primary spontaneous, secondary spontaneous, or traumatic) leads to significant impairment of respiration and/ or blood circulation.
- The most common findings: chest pain and respiratory distress, tachycardia, tachyrnea
Other findings may include:
- Quieter breath sounds on one side of the chest,
- Low oxygen levels and Love blood pressure,
- cyanosis
- Altered level of consciousness

\section*{Clinical types of Pneumothorax}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_14_ffa9e6a5e4c0b732d9b5g-102.jpg?height=1538&width=2215&top_left_y=328&top_left_x=397)

\section*{General Signs and symptoms}
- Breath sounds (with a stethoscope) may be diminished on the affected side.
- Percussion of the chest may be perceived as hyperresonant (like a booming drum).
- Dyspnea
- Chest pain (pleuritic pain)
- Rare signs and symptoms include: Cough, Hemoptysis, Cyanosis, Iachycardia

Physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small

\section*{Physical examination:}
- Depend on size of pneumothorax
- The vital signs usually normal
- Unilateral Chest movements
- The percussion note is hyper-resonant
- The breath sounds are reduced or absent on the affected side
- The lower edge of the liver may be shifted inferiorly with a right-side pneumothorax

Diagnostic procedures
- Xray, Ct scan, Ultrasound

\section*{Management}
- In TRAUMATIC PNEUMOJHORAX, chest tubes are usually inserted.
- If mechanical ventilation is required, the risk of tension pneumothorax is greatly increased and the insertion of a chest tube is mandatory.
- Any open chest wound should be covered wiith an airtight seal, as it carries a high risk of leading to tension pneumothorax.
- JENSION PNEUMOTHORAX is usually treated with urgent needle decompression.
- The needle or cannula is left in place until a chest tube can be inserted.

\section*{OTHER JREAJMENTS}

\section*{Aspiration}
- Reducing the size of pneumothorax by aspiration is equally effective as the insertion of a chest tube.
- This ineolves the administration of local anesthetic and inserting a needle connected to a three-way tap; up to 2.5 liters of air (in adults) are removed.

\section*{Chest tube}
- A chest tube (or intercostal drain) is the most definitive initial treatment of a pneumothorax.
- These are typically inserted in an area under the axilla (armpit) called the "safe triangle", where damage to internal organs can be awoided
- Local anesthetic is applied.

\section*{In Intercostal tube drainage}
- INDICATIONS
- Unstable pneumothorax
- Severe dyspnea
- fung collapse
- Open or tension pneumothorax
- Recurrent pneumothorax
- If Simple aspiration drainage is unsuccessful in controlling symptoms

\section*{Pleurodesis and surgery}
- Pleurodesis is a procedure that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall.
- Thoracotomy with identification of any source of air leakage is done followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining)

During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space.

\section*{Comptications of Pneumothorax}
- Hydropneumothorax.
- Hemopneumotorax

\section*{Assignment:}
1. Describe the nursing management of a patient with a chest tube drainage.
2. Read and write short notes on:
- Hemothorax

\section*{LUING CARCINOMA}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_14_ffa9e6a5e4c0b732d9b5g-113.jpg?height=1274&width=964&top_left_y=334&top_left_x=1663)

\section*{DEFINITION}
- Lung cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled cell grouth in tissues of the lung.
- If left untreated, this groueth can spread beyond the lung in a process called metastasis into nearby tissue and, eventually, into other parts of the body.

\section*{Signs and symptoms:}
- Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
- Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)
- Chronic coughing or change in regular coughing pattern
- Wheezing
- Chest pain
- Cachexia (weight loss),
- Fatigue
- Loss of appetite
- Clubbing of the fingernails (uncommon)
- Dysphagia (difficulty suealloueing)

\section*{Causes and risk Pactors:}

\section*{a) Smoking}
- Smoking, particularly of cigarettes, is by far the main contributor to lung cancer. Cigarette smoke contains over 60 known carcinogens.
- Additionally, nicotine appears to depress the immune response to malignant grouths in exposed tissue.
- Passive smoking - the inhalation of smoke from another's smoking-may be a cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers.
- 10-15\% of lung cancer patients have never smoked.

\section*{Smoker's lungs}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_14_ffa9e6a5e4c0b732d9b5g-117.jpg?height=1341&width=2248&top_left_y=335&top_left_x=184)

Non-smoker's lungs

\section*{b) Asbestos}
- Asbestos can cause a variety of lung diseases, including lung cancer.
c) Viruses
- Recent studies suggest wiral carcinogenic potential in humans.
- These wiruses may affect the cell cycle and inhibit apoptosis (programmed cell death), allouing uncontrolled cell division.
- Implicated viruses include:
- human papillomaairus.
- cytomegalouirus.

\section*{d) Air pollution}
- Indoor air pollution - by radon
- Radon is A radioactive gaseous element formed by the disintegration of radium; the heaviest of the inert gasses.
- Inhalation - causes bronchial deposition of radioactive decay products posing carcinogenic possibilities

\section*{Diagnosis:}
- Chest Radiograph: Look Por- An obleious mass and areas shouling atelectasis (collapse)
- If Blood stained sputum is present, but radiograph normal, then:
-Bronchoscopy
- CT Scan
- CT Scan guided biopsy(to find the tumor type)
-Sputum Cytologic examination

Squamous cell carcinoma

\section*{Classification:}
- Lung carcinomas classified according to histological types:
i. Small cell carcinoma
ii. Non-small-cell carcinoma:
- Squamous cell lung carcinoma
- Adenocarcinoma, and
- Large-cell lung carcinoma.

\section*{Metastasis:}
- The lung is a common place for metastasis of tumors from other parts of the body.
- Secondary cancers are classified by the site of origin; e.g., breast cancer that has spread to the lung is called breast cancer.

\section*{Management:}
- Surgical
- Non-surgical
- Radiotherapy
- Chemotherapy

\section*{Radiotherapy:}

Radiation the rapy works by damaging the DNA of cancerous cells.

\section*{Chemotherapy:}
- The chemotherapy regimen depends on the tumor type:
i) Small-cell lung carcinoma
- Cisplatin and Etoposide are most commonly used.
ii) Non-small-cell lung carcinoma
- Advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma is often treated with Cisplatin or Carboplatin, in combination with Gemcitabine.

\section*{Surgical Management}
* Lobectomy: In patients with adequate respiratory reserve this is preferred, as this minimizes the chance of local recurrence.
* Preumonectomy - Surgical removal of a lung (usually to treat lung cancer)

\section*{OBSTRUCTIVE RESPIRAJORY CONDITIONS}

BRONCHITIS

\section*{BRONCHITIS}
- Definition: Bronchitis is an inflammation or suelling of the Bronchial tubes (Bronchi)
- Individuals with bronchitis breathe less air and oxygen into their lungs; they also have heave mucus or phlegm (expectorated matter) Porming in their airways.
Causes
- Virus (more common)
- In most cases bronchitis is caused by the same beirus that cause the common cold or flu (influenza birus)

\section*{Pre desposing factors of Bronchitis}
- Smoking
- People who are exposed to a lot of second-hand smoke
- People with weakened immune systems
- The elderly and infants
- People with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - aspiration risks
- People who are exposed to air pollution
***Bronchitis may be ACUJE or CHRONIC

\section*{Acute Bronchitis.}
- Is characterized by the development of cough
- Acute bronchitis often occurs after a cold or Plu, as the result of bacterial infection, or from constant irritation of the bronchi by polluted air or chemical fumes in the eneironment.

\section*{Cont..}
- Also characterized by a slight peoer that may last Por a Pene days to weeks
- Acute bronchitis, symptoms usually resolve weithin 7 to 10 days, however, a dry, hacking cough can occur for several weeks.
- Acute bronchitis is more common and often serious in small children because their bronchi are smaller and more easily obstructed and also in the elderly.

\section*{Chronic Bronchitis.}
- Is a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) caused by chronic respiratory infections and chronic exposure to eneironmental pollutants and irritants
- As the condition gets ueorse, the person becomes increasingly affected by shortness of breath and may require supplemental oxygen.
- It may also include fever, presence of productive cough that last for 3 months or more per year.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY.}
- Short term irritation of respiratory tract leads to inflammation resulting in hyper secretion of mucus and initial dry irritating cough which later becomes productive.
- Continued bronchial irritation leads to chronic Bronchitis.
- Resulting in hypertrophy and hyperplasia of bronchial mucous glands and mucous producing goblet cells thus causing increased secretion by the Bronchial mucosa.
- Chronic infiltration of the bronchial wealls by leucocytes and lymphocytes occur making the Bronchial wall to become thickened and the Bronchial lumen to become narrowed thus interfering with the Plous of air to and Prom the lungs.
- The narrowed lumen often becomes plugged with the mucus. Because of the inflammatory process, the patient has pever with accompanying chills, headache, chest pain and loss of appetite

\section*{Signs And Symptoms Of Bronchitis}
- Cough.
- Wheezing.
- Throat pain.
- Difficulty in breathing .
- Chest discomport and soreness.
- Fatigue and headache.
- Fever
- Sueeating
- Nausea.

\section*{DIAGNOSTIC tests}
- History taking.
- Clinical manifestation.
- Physical examination.
- Chest x-ray (Reveal bronchoconstriction, hyperinllation and rounded diagram).
- Sputum culture reveals microorganisms
- Arterial blood gas analysis reveals Respiratory alkalosis.

\section*{General Management \& Treatment}
- Bed rest,
- drink copious Pluids,
- Breathe warm and moist air
- cough surpressants
- pair relievers
- Many cases of acute bronchitis may go aveay without any specific treatment, but there is no cure for chronic bronchitis.
- Antibiotics may be prescribed so as to prevent secondary infections
- Cough medications may be administered but we should not suppress the cough completely because its usually important to bring up mucus and remove irritants from the lungs.
- Bronchodilator and Mucolytics help open bronchial tubes, thin and clear out mucus.

BRONCHIOLITIS

\section*{Bronchiolitis}
- Is inflammation of the fine bronchioles and small bronchi.

\section*{Causes}
- Viruses, such as
- Adenoilirus,
- ParainPluenza uirus
- Respiratory syncytial oirus(RSV)

\section*{Clinical Peatures}
- Increased respiratory rate
- Mild Pever
- Leukocytosis
- Atelectasis
- Tachycardia
- Exhaustion

\section*{Management}
- Antipyretics
- Adequate hydration
- Hospitalization in severe distress
- Humidified oxygen
- Nebulized bronchodilators, epinephrine, and anti-inPlammatory medications
- Assisted ventilation
- Nutritional support

\section*{Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD)}

\section*{Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases}
-Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) repers to chronic bronchitis and emphysema, a pair of two commonly co- existing diseases of the lungs in which the airways become narrowed.
- This leads to a limitation of the Plouv of air to and from the lungs causing shortness of breath.

\section*{In COPD, less air flows in and out of the airveays because of one or more of the following:}
- The airways and air sacs lose their elastic quality.
- The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed.
- The wealls of the airways become thick and inflamed.
- The airways make more mucus than usual, which tends to clog them.
COPD Refers to both:
1. Chronic bronchitis (discussed earlier)
2. Emphysema

\section*{EMPHYSEMA}

Definition:-
- Emphysema is defined as enlargement with destruction of the walls of the alleeoli.
- As the alweoli are destroyed the alweolar surface area in contact with the capillaries decreases reducing gaseous exchange leading to hypoxia.

\section*{In later stages: C02 elimination is disturbed and increase in CO2 tension in arterial blood causing respiratory acidosis}

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
- Blood Test - Blood tests can help determine if symptoms are being caused by an infection.
- An arterial blood gas test weill measure the amount of oxygen in blood.
- Chest X-ray or CT scan
- Sputum Examination - especially if the client has a productive cough. Analyzing sputum can help identify the cause of breathing difficulties
- ECG - to determine if your shortness of breath is being caused by a heart condition.
- Pulmonary Function Test - measure houe well the lungs are moving air in and out. They also measure hour well the lungs are moving oxygen to the blood.

\section*{MEDICAL MANAGEMENT}

The treatment goal for the client with COPD are:
- To improve wentilation
$>$ To facilitate the removal of bronchial secretions
$>$ To promote health maintenance
$>$ To reduce compotications, and
- To sloue progression of the disease
- Smoking cessation - Cessation of cigarette smoking is single most effective and cost effective intervention to reduce the risk of developing COPD and stop the progression of the disease.
- Bronchodilator drug therapy dilate the air passages by relaxing the bronchial smooth muscle and improve the wentilation of lungs. They are usually administered wia inhalation route but in rare occasions may be given orally or administered intracenously.
- Oxygen therapy

\section*{Surgical management}
- Bullectomy - Bullae are enlarged airspaces that do not contribute to ventillation but occupy space in the thorax, these areas may be surgically excised
- Lung wolume reduction surgery - It incolves the removal of a portion of the diseased lung parenchyma.this allous the functional tissue to expand.
- Lung transptantation

\section*{Nursing management}

Nursing diagnosis - Impaired gas exchange related to decreased ventilation
Objectives - Improve ventilation

\section*{Intervention}
a. Monitor lung sounds every 4 to 8 hours.
b. Perform chest physiotherapy
c. Advice the client to drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of fluid per day unless contraindicated
d. Teach the client about coughing technique
e. Asses the condition of oral mucus membrane and perform oral care

Nursing diagnosis
Disturbed sleep pattern related to dyspnea Objectives
Getting adequate rest

\section*{Intervention}
- Promote relaxation by providing a darkened, quiet encironment, ensure adequate room wentilation.
- Schedule care activities to allow periods of uninterrupted sleep.

\section*{Nursing diagnosis - Anxiety related to acute breathing difficultives and fear of suppocation Objectives - Relieve Pear of dying}

Intervention
- Provide a quiet, calm environment.
- During acute episodes, open doors and curtains and limit the number of people in the room.
- Encourage the use of breathing relaxation technique
- Nonpharmacological methods of anxiety reduction are more useful

Nursing diagnosis - Ineffective airway clearance related to excessive secretions and ineffective
coughing
Objective - EPPective airuacy clearance
Intervention
- Monitor lung sounds every 4 to 8 hours.
- Perform chest physiotherapy
- Adrice the client to drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of Pluid per day unless contraindicated
- Jeach the client in coughing technique
- Asses the condition of oral mucus membrane and perform oral care

\section*{Complications}
- More Prequent lung infections, such as pneumonia.
- Heart Pailure affecting the right side of the heart
- A collapsed lung (pneumothorax).
- Sleep problems.

BRONCHIECTASIS

Derbucton: Bronchlectasis is a cnronc, urreversbote dilation of the bronchi and bronchioles.
Involves Irrewersible bronchial dilatation
auses
dirueay obstruction
Diffuse airueay injury
Pulmonary infections and obstruction of the ronchus
Genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis
Abnormal host delense (eg immunodeficiency)
Idiopathic causes

\section*{Clinical Peatures}
- Chronic cough with mucopurulent sputum
- Wheezing or stridor.
- Cyanosis
- Easy Patigability
- Retarded physical grouth
- Chest enlargement from over-inflation of alveoli caused by the air trapped behind inflamed bronchi.
- Clubbing of the fingers also is common because of respiratory insulficiency

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- The inflammatory process associated with pulmonary infections damages the bronchial wall, causing a loss of its supporting structure and resulting in thick sputum that ultimately obstructs the bronchi. The walls become permanently distended and distorted, impairing mucociliary clearance.
- The inflammation and infection may extend to the peribronchial tissues; each dilated tube oirtually amounting to a lung abscess. The exudate of which drains Preely through the bronchus.
- Bronchiectasis is usually localized, affecting a segment or lobe of a lung, most frequently the lower lobes.
- The retention of secretions and subsequent obstruction ultimately cause the alweoli distal to the obstruction to collapse (atelectasis).
- Inflammatory scarring or fibrosis replaces functioning lung tissue. In time the patient develops respiratory insulficiency with reduced wital capacity and decreased wentilation leading to hypoxemia.

\section*{Investigations}
- Full blood count
- Sputum exam
- Ct scan

\section*{General Management}
- Early and effective management reduces shortand long-term morbidity
- Airueay clearance - Example: By chest physio.
- Nutrition
- Avoid eneironmental pollutants e.g Jobacco
- Assessment for co-morbidities (other respiratory disorders)
- Intensive antibiotic treatments to Reduce microbial load
- Inhaled mucolytic agents or bronchodilators
- Chest physiotherapy-to raise the tenacious sputum.
- Treat the cause
- Smoking cessation is important because smoking impairs bronchial drainage by paralyzing ciliary action, increasing bronchial secretions, and causing inflammation of the mucous membranes

\section*{Nursing Management}
- Nursing management of the patient weith bronchiectasis focuses on alleneiating symptoms and assisting the patient to clear pulmonary secretions.
- Smoking and other factors that increase the production of mucus and hamper its remoeal are targeted in patient teaching.
- The patient and Pamily are taught to perform postural drainage and to acoid exposure to others weith upper respiratory and other infections.
- If the patient experiences Patigue and dyspnea, strategies to conserve energy while maintaining a lifestyle as active as possible are discussed.
- The patient needs to become knouledgeable about early signs of respiratory infection and the progression of the disorder so that appropriate treatment can be implemented promptly.
- The patient's nutritional status is assessed and strategies are implemented to ensure an adequate diet.

\section*{BRONCHIAL ASTHMA}

\section*{Introduction}

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airveays that is characterized:
- clinically by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and cough, particularly at night/early morning.
- physiologically by widespread, reversible narrowing of the bronchial airways and a marked increase in bronchial responsiveness.

\section*{Classilication}

Atopic /extrinsic /allergic asthma(~70\%)
- IgE mediated immune responses to environmental antigens.

\section*{Non-atopic/intrinsic/non-allergic asthma(~30\%)}
- Triggered by non immune stimuli.
- Patients have negative skin test to common inhalant allergens and normal serum concentrations of Ig $\varepsilon$.
- Asthma may be triggered by aspirin, pulmonary infections, cold, exercise, psychological stress or inhaled irritants.

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- Mast cells in response to allergens release histamine and leukotrienes that result in diffuse obstructive and restrictive airway due to:
$\checkmark$ Chronic inflammation,
$\checkmark$ Airueay hyperresponsiveness
- Bronchoconstriction
- Increased mucus production.

\section*{1. Inflammation}

\section*{Chronic inflammatory state}
- Involves respiratory mucosa from trachea to terminal bronchioles, predominantly in the bronchi.
- Activation of mast cell, infiltration of eosingphils \& T-helper lymphocytes occur.
- Many different inflammatory mediators are incolved.

\section*{Inflammation...}
- Exact cause of airueay inflammation is thought to be an interplay between endogenous and environmental factors.

\section*{Endogenous factors -}
- Genetics
- Atopy (allergy)-
- The major risk factor for asthma
- Asthma is commonly associated with other atopic diseases - allergic rhinitis(80\%), atopic dermatitis, urticaria, etc.

\section*{Inflammation...}

\section*{Environmental factors}

Viral infections - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Mycoplasma, Chlamydia
$\square$ Air pollution
Allergens - house dust

\section*{2. Airueay Hyperresponsiveness (AHR)}
