University of Nairobi

\section*{Objectives}
- State childhood illnesses that present with respiratory distress
- Describe management of a child with pneumonia
- Describe management of a child with asthma

\section*{Respiratory Distress- Causes}

\section*{Lung / Airway Disease}
- Acute Pneumonia
- Asthma
- PTB
- HIV-PCP
- Croup (LTB)
- Bronchiolitis

Systemic Disease
- Malaria
- Severe Anaemia
- Severe dehydration
- Heart Disease
- Renal Disease

\section*{Pneumonia}
- Pneumonia can be classified per the causes (Viral, bacterial, fungal) or as per severity.
- Most acute respiratory infections including pneumonia are viral

\section*{Pneumonia}
- In this session we will concentrate on the severity of the respiratory distress.
- A few signs in a child with cough and difficulty breathing can classify severity.
- We will introduce the new pneumonia guidelines - all protocol books before 2016 are out of date!

\section*{Target patient}
- Cough or difficulty breathing in a patient aged 259months
- The pneumonia guideline should be applied cautiously in the following patients:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Assessment & Action /cause \\
\hline Cough or fever more than 14 days & Consider TB \\
\hline Exposure to TB or chronic cough & Consider TB \\
\hline Severe acute malnutrition & Use guidelines for severe acute malnutrition \\
\hline HIV infection & Use guidelines for HIV infected children \\
\hline Readmission & Consider hospital acquired infection/TB/missed diagnosis \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Admission or discharge for pneumonia with in - drawing?}
- A child with cough or difficulty breathing with lower chest wall indrawing BUT no danger signs can safely be managed as an outpatient
- If review at 48 hours can be conducted at a clinic
- If the family can bring the child sooner for any deterioration - careful counseling on danger signs that should prompt early return must be given
- Is there another illness that makes admission necessary?
-What is the HIV status?
- Is there severe acute malnutrition?
-What are the benefits of oral OPD therapy?

How severe is respiratory distress - Cough or Difficult Breathing 1

Cyanosed/oxygen sat <90\%?
Unable to drink?
Reduced level of consciousness?
Grunting?
Y Severe
Pneumonia

High Risk of Death
High Risk of Hypoxaemia =Give oxygen if saturations <90\% or based on clinical S+S

May need fluid / feeding support
Require Broad Spectrum Antibiotics

How severe is respiratory distress - Cough or Difficult Breathing (2)
Lower chest wall indrawing?
OR Fast breathing?
( $R R \geq 50$ aged $2-11$ months
$R R \geq 40$ aged 12 - 59months)

Not severely ill = Outpatient care if 48hr review possible Can feed orally, is alert \& supplemental oxygen not needed Require high dose Amoxicillin $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ dose BD for 5 days Review in 2 days for improvement /deterioration/unable to feed

\section*{How severe is respiratory distress - Cough or Difficult Breathing}

\section*{History of cough / difficult breathing ONLY}

Outpatient care
Antibiotics not indicated
Counsel on signs of deterioration

Cough syrups SHOULD NOT be prescribed.

\section*{$4^{\text {th }}$ Edition (Jan 2016) Pneumonia Guidelines}

\section*{Cyanosed or oxy}

Inpatient penicillin + Gentamicin Injectab

\section*{Severe}

\section*{Pneumonia}

\section*{Grunting?}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_14_0534f997c8df49e7e661g-12.jpg?height=1035&width=2083&top_left_y=825&top_left_x=320)

\section*{HIV infected/exposed}
- HIV infected or exposed with either :
- Severe pneumonia or
- Pneumonia with in-drawing
- Admit
- Treat with crystalline Penicillin \& Gentamicin
- Oxygen if required
< 12months of age give empiric treatment for PCP high dose cotrimoxazole

Empiric treatment for PCP is NOT recommended in children older than 12 months with severe pneumonia or pneumonia with lower chest wall in-drawing

\section*{Asthma}
- Most children with asthma will have a wheeze in addition to the cough or difficulties in breathing
- Severity of asthma is graded using just a few signs as for pneumonia
- Degree of severity can change after the initial dose of bronchodilators - reassess frequently.
- Consider other causes of wheeze for atypical presentation.

\section*{Wheeze - how severe is the asthma?}

Cyanosed or oxygen Saturation<90\%?
Unable to drink?
Reduced level of consciousness?
Grunting?

Asthma - treat and reassess and decide about antibiotics

\section*{Providing Salbutamol}

Nebulisers

- 2.5 mg for ages up to 5 yrs

Note this child has altered consciousness
- meningitis is possible so LP, do BS for malaria

\section*{Cause of Respiratory Distress 3?}

QUESTIONS?

\section*{Summary}
- Key clinical signs define the severity of respiratory distress
- Define severity of asthma/pneumonia and treat appropriately.
- Danger signs - inpatient care
- No danger signs - outpatient care
- Success of treatment of pneumonia with high dose oral amoxicillin is comparable to that of crystalline penicillin
