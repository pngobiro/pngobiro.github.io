                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">DYSPNEA</h3>
                        <p>Difficulty in breathing or labored breathing or shortness of Breath. Is a symptom common to many pulmonary and cardiac disorders, particularly when there is decreased lung compliance or increased airway resistance. E.g in asthma. It may also be associated with neurologic or neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Significance</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acute diseases of the lungs produce a more severe grade of dyspnea than chronic diseases.</li>
                            <li>Sudden dyspnea in a healthy person may indicate pneumothorax, acute respiratory obstruction, or Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).</li>
                            <li>In immobilized patients, sudden dyspnea may denote pulmonary embolism.</li>
                            <li>Orthopnea may be found in patients with heart disease and occasionally in patients with COPD;</li>
                            <li>dyspnea with an expiratory wheeze occurs with COPD.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">COUGH</h3>
                        <p>Results from irritation of the mucous membranes anywhere in the respiratory tract by smoke, dust, or a gas. Cough is the chief protection mechanism against the accumulation of secretions in the bronchi and Bronchioles.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Significance</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cough may indicate serious pulmonary disease.</li>
                            <li>Described as dry, hacking, productive or severe.</li>
                            <li>A dry, irritative cough is characteristic of an upper respiratory tract infection.</li>
                            <li>Infection of viral origin causes an irritative, high-pitched cough.</li>
                            <li>Pleuritic chest pain accompanying coughing may indicate pleural involvement.</li>
                            <li>Cough in the morning with sputum indicate Bronchitis.</li>
                            <li>Cough after food may indicate aspiration in the tracheal bronchial tree.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">SPUTUM PRODUCTION</h3>
                        <p>Sputum production is the reaction of the lungs to any constantly recurring irritant.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Significance</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A profuse amount of purulent sputum or a change in color of the sputum probably indicates a bacterial infection.</li>
                            <li>Thin, mucoid sputum frequently results from viral Bronchitis.</li>
                            <li>Foul smelling sputum indicate lung abcess or bronchiectasis.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CHEST PAIN</h3>
                        <p>May be associated with pulmonary or cardiac disease. Chest pain associated with pulmonary conditions may be sharp, stabbing, and intermittent, or it may be dull, aching, and persistent. The pain usually is felt on the side where the pathologic process is located, but it may be referred elsewhere-for example, to the neck, back, or abdomen.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Significance</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chest pain may occur with pneumonia, pulmonary embolism with lung infarction, and pleurisy.</li>
                            <li>Pleuritic pain is sharp and intensifies on inspiration.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">WHEEZING</h3>
                        <p>Is often the major finding in a patient with bronchoconstriction or airway narrowing. It is a high-pitched, musical sound heard mainly on expiration. Common in asthma. Relief Measures: Oral or inhalant Bronchodilator medications reverse wheezing in most instances.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CLUBBING OF THE FINGERS</h3>
                        <p>Is a sign of lung disease found in patients with chronic hypoxic conditions, chronic lung infections, and malignancies of the lung. Manifested initially as loss of the nail bed angle.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">HEMOPTYSIS</h3>
                        <p>Is the expectoration of blood from the respiratory tract. Is a common symptom of pulmonary and cardiac disorders. The most common causes are: Pulmonary infection, Carcinoma of the lung, Abnormalities of the heart or blood vessels, Pulmonary emboli and infarction, Chest trauma.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CYANOSIS</h3>
                        <p>Is a very late indicator of hypoxia (oxygen deficiency in body tissues). The presence or absence of cyanosis is determined by the amount of unoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood. Two types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Central cyanosis</strong> is assessed by observing the color of the tongue and lips.</li>
                            <li><strong>Peripheral cyanosis</strong> results from decreased blood flow to a certain area of the body (e.g extremities).</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)</h3>
                        <p>Are routinely used in patients with chronic respiratory disorders. Performed to assess respiratory function and to determine the extent of dysfunction. Such tests include measurements of lung volumes, ventilatory function, and the mechanics of breathing, diffusion, and gas exchange. PFTs are useful in a patient with an established respiratory disease and assessing the response to therapy.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Arterial Blood Gases (ABGs)</h3>
                        <p>Involves measurements of blood pH and of arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions. Arterial blood gas studies aid in assessing the ability of the lungs to provide adequate oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. Also involves the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb or excrete bicarbonate ions to maintain normal body pH.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4. Pulse Oximetry (SPO2)</h3>
                        <p>Pulse oximetry is a method of continuously monitoring the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin. A probe or sensor is attached to the fingertip, earlobe, or bridge of the nose. Normal SpO2 values are 95% to 100%. Values less than 85% indicate that the tissues are not receiving enough oxygen, and the patient needs further evaluation.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5. Sputum Studies</h3>
                        <p>Sputum is obtained for analysis to identify pathogenic organisms and to determine whether malignant cells are present. It also may be used to assess for hypersensitivity states. In general, sputum cultures are used in diagnosis, for drug sensitivity testing, and to guide treatment.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">6. Imaging Studies</h3>
                        <p>This include x-rays, CT, MRI, Contrast studies, pulmonary angiography etc.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7. Endoscopic Procedures</h3>
                        <p><strong>Bronchoscopy</strong> is the direct inspection and examination of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi using a bronchoscope. <strong>Thoracoscopy</strong> is a diagnostic procedure in which the pleural cavity is examined with an endoscope. It is primarily indicated in the diagnostic evaluation of pleural effusions and pleural disease.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">8. Thoracentesis</h3>
                        <p>Aspiration of fluid from the chest by centesis for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes (centesis is the act of puncturing a body cavity or organ with a hollow needle in order to draw out fluid).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">9. Biopsy</h3>
                        <p>The excision of a small amount of tissue, may be performed to permit examination of cells from the pharynx, larynx, and nasal passages.</p>
