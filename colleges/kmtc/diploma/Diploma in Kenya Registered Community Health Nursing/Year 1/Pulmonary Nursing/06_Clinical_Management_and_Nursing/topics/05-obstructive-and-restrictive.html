                        <p>Pneumonia is an acute respiratory illness and a condition that involves inflammation of lower lung structures such as the alveoli or interstitial spaces. It can be community acquired, hospital acquired or occurring due to immunosuppression.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Classification of Pneumonia</h4>
                        <p>Pneumonia is classified according to the predisposing environment and the pattern of damage executed in the lungs.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP):</strong> Occurring in the community setting or within the first 48 hours after hospitalization.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP):</strong> Onset of symptoms more than 48 hours after hospital admission.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pneumonia in the Immunocompromised Host:</strong> Occurs due to factors like prolonged corticosteroid use, chemotherapy, or AIDS.</li>
                            <li><strong>Aspiration Pneumonia:</strong> Results from entry of endogenous or exogenous substances into the lower airway.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pattern of Damage</h4>
                        <p><strong>Lobar pneumonia:</strong> Refers to the pneumonia in which a substantial portion of one or more lobes of the lungs is involved.</p>
                        <p><strong>Bronchopneumonia:</strong> The disease is distributed in a patchy fashion, originating from one or more localized areas within the bronchi and extending to the adjacent surrounding lung parenchyma.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h4>
                        <p>An infectious organism reaches the alveoli, overwhelming macrophages and resulting in a fibrin-rich exudate that fills alveolar spaces. The inflammatory response also results in a proliferation of neutrophils which can damage lung tissue, leading to fibrosis and pulmonary oedema. These changes result in reduced gaseous exchange and increased respiratory effort.</p>

                        <p>The goals of care are to ensure clear breath sounds, normal breathing patterns, and no complications.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Pharmacotherapy:</strong> Antibiotic therapy (e.g., Macrolides, Beta-lactams, Fluoroquinolones), antipyretics, and antitussives.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nursing Interventions:</strong> Improving airway patency through hydration and chest physiotherapy, promoting rest, maintaining nutrition, monitoring for complications, and patient education.</li>
                            <li><strong>Complications:</strong> Bacteremia, lung abscess, pleural effusion, respiratory failure.</li>

                        <p>Pleurisy is the inflammation of the pleura of the lungs (especially the parietal layer). It is most often caused by a viral infection but can result from other conditions like pneumonia, TB, or chest trauma.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                        <p>Objectives are to discover the underlying cause and relieve pain. This includes treating the primary disease (e.g., pneumonia), administering anti-inflammatory drugs and pain relievers, and using bronchodilators. Nurses can help ease painful respiration by positioning the patient on the affected side and teaching them to splint the chest when coughing.</p>

                        <p>Bronchitis is an inflammation or swelling of the Bronchial tubes (Bronchi). Individuals with bronchitis breathe less air and oxygen into their lungs; they also have heavy mucus or phlegm forming in their airways. It can be acute or chronic.</p>

                            <li><strong>Acute Bronchitis:</strong> Often follows a cold or flu, typically viral. Symptoms resolve within weeks.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chronic Bronchitis:</strong> A form of COPD, defined by a productive cough for at least 3 months in each of two consecutive years.</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h4>
                        <p>Irritation of the respiratory tract leads to inflammation, resulting in hypersecretion of mucus. In chronic bronchitis, mucous glands hypertrophy and hyperplasia occur, thickening the bronchial walls and narrowing the lumen. This interferes with airflow and increases susceptibility to infection.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                        <p>Treatment includes bed rest, fluids, cough suppressants (with caution), pain relievers, and antibiotics if a secondary bacterial infection is present. Bronchodilators and mucolytics help open airways and clear mucus.</p>

                        <p>COPD refers to chronic bronchitis and emphysema, a pair of two commonly co-existing diseases of the lungs in which the airways become narrowed. This leads to a limitation of the flow of air to and from the lungs causing shortness of breath.</p>

                        <p>Emphysema is defined as enlargement with destruction of the walls of the alveoli. As the alveoli are destroyed the alveolar surface area in contact with the capillaries decreases, reducing gaseous exchange and leading to hypoxia.</p>

                        <p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and cough. It involves reversible bronchospasm and airway "hyperactivity".</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h4>
                        <p>Exposure to a trigger causes mast cells to release inflammatory mediators (histamine, prostaglandins), leading to bronchospasm, edema, and excess mucus production. This obstructs the airways, making expiration more difficult than inspiration, which causes a wheeze.</p>

                            <li><strong>Long-acting control medications:</strong> Corticosteroids (inhaled/oral), leukotriene modifiers, and cromolyn sodium to manage chronic inflammation.</li>

                        <p>A prolonged and severe asthma attack that does not respond to standard treatment and can last for more than 24 hours. It is a life-threatening emergency.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                        <p>Requires aggressive management including high-concentration oxygen, nebulized bronchodilators (salbutamol), IV corticosteroids (hydrocortisone), and IV fluids. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary if the patient fails to respond.</p>

                        <p>A chronic, irreversible dilation of the bronchi and bronchioles, often resulting from prolonged injury or inflammation. Damaged air passages allow bacteria and mucus to build up, leading to frequent infections.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                        <p>Most children are managed at home with supportive care. Since it's viral, antibiotics are not effective unless there is a secondary bacterial infection. A very small percentage of children require hospitalization for oxygen and hydration support.</p>
