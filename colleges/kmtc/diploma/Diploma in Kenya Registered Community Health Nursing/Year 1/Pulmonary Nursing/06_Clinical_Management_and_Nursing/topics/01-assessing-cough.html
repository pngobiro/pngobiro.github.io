                    </h2>

                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_14_a4b2552ec3a799217ee0g-1-1.jpg" alt="A healthcare worker listening to a child's breathing with a stethoscope while the mother holds the child." class="content-image">
                        
                        <p>Respiratory infections can occur in any part of the respiratory tract such as the nose, throat, larynx, trachea, air passages or lungs. A child with cough or difficult breathing may have pneumonia or another severe respiratory infection. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs. Both bacteria and viruses can cause pneumonia. In developing countries, pneumonia is often due to bacteria. The most common are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae. Children with bacterial pneumonia may die from hypoxia (too little oxygen) or sepsis (generalized infection).</p>
                        
                        <p>Many children are brought to the clinic with less serious respiratory infections. Most children with cough or difficult breathing have only a mild infection. For example, a child who has a cold may cough because nasal discharge drips down the back of the throat. Or the child may have a viral infection of the bronchi called bronchitis. These children are not seriously ill. They do not need treatment with antibiotics. Their families can manage them at home.</p>

                        <p>You need to identify the few, very sick children with cough or difficult breathing who need treatment with antibiotics. Fortunately, you can identify almost all cases of pneumonia by checking for these two clinical signs: fast breathing and chest indrawing.</p>

                        <p>When children develop pneumonia, their lungs become stiff. One of the body's responses to stiff lungs and hypoxia (too little oxygen) is fast breathing. When the pneumonia becomes more severe, the lungs become even stiffer. Chest indrawing may develop. Chest indrawing is a sign of severe pneumonia.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Moving down the left side of the ASSESS AND CLASSIFY chart, you find the first main symptom box. Each main symptom box contains two parts: an assessment section on the left side and a colour-coded classification table on the right. The assessment section lists questions and clinical signs under the headings ask, look, listen, check and feel.</p>
                        <p>Before entering a main symptom box, ask if the child has the main symptom. For example, ask, "Does the child have cough or difficult breathing?" If the answer is NO, leave the box and move down the chart to the next main symptom box. If the answer is YES, ask the questions and check the clinical signs in the assessment section of the box. Then follow the classify arrow across the page to the classification table.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>For ALL sick children:</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>ASK: Does the child have cough or difficult breathing?</strong></p>
                        <p>Difficult breathing is any unusual pattern of breathing. Mothers describe this in different ways. They may say that their child's breathing is "fast" or "noisy" or "interrupted."</p>
                        
                        <p>If the mother answers NO, look to see if you think the child has cough or difficult breathing. If the child does not have cough or difficult breathing, ask about the next main symptom, diarrhoea. Do not assess the child further for signs related to cough or difficult breathing.</p>
                        
                        <p>If the mother answers YES, ask the next question.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>ASK: For how long?</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A child who has had cough or difficult breathing for more than 30 days has a chronic cough. This may be a sign of tuberculosis, asthma, whooping cough or another problem.</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>COUNT the breaths in one minute</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You must count the breaths the child takes in one minute to decide if the child has fast breathing. The child must be quiet and calm when you look and listen to his breathing. If the child is frightened, crying or angry, you will not be able to obtain an accurate count of the child's breaths.</p>
                        <p>Tell the mother you are going to count her child's breathing. Remind her to keep her child calm. If the child is sleeping, do not wake the child. To count the number of breaths in one minute. Use a watch with a second hand or a digital watch. Look for breathing movement anywhere on the child's chest or abdomen.</p>
                        <p>Usually you can see breathing movements even on a child who is dressed. If you cannot see this movement easily, ask the mother to lift the child's shirt. If the child starts to cry, ask the mother to calm the child before you start counting. If you are not sure about the number of breaths you counted (for example, if the child was actively moving and it was difficult to watch the chest, or if the child was upset or crying), repeat the count.</p>
                        <p>The cut-off for fast breathing depends on the child's age. Normal breathing rates are higher in children age 2 months up to 12 months than in children age 12 months up to 5 years. For this reason, the cut-off for identifying fast breathing is higher in children 2 months up to 12 months than in children age 12 months up to 5 years.</p>

                        <p>Note: The child who is exactly 12 months old has fast breathing if you count 40 breaths per minute or more.</p>

                        <p>Before you look for the next two signs -- chest indrawing and stridor -- watch the child to determine when the child is breathing IN and when the child is breathing OUT.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">LOOK for chest indrawing</h3>
                        <p>If you did not lift the child's shirt when you counted the child's breaths, ask the mother to lift it now.</p>
                        <p>Look for chest indrawing when the child breathes IN. Look at the lower chest wall (lower ribs). The child has chest indrawing if the lower chest wall goes IN when the child breathes IN. Chest indrawing occurs when the effort the child needs to breathe in is much greater than normal. In normal breathing, the whole chest wall (upper and lower) and the abdomen move OUT when the child breathes IN. When chest indrawing is present, the lower chest wall goes IN when the child breathes IN.</p>
                        <p>If you are not sure that chest indrawing is present, look again. If the child's body is bent at the waist, it is hard to see the lower chest wall move. Ask the mother to change the child's position so he is lying flat in her lap. If you still do not see the lower chest wall go IN when the child breathes IN, the child does not have chest indrawing. For chest indrawing to be present, it must be clearly visible and present all the time. If you only see chest indrawing when the child is crying or feeding, the child does not have chest indrawing.</p>
                        <p>If only the soft tissue between the ribs goes in when the child breathes in (also called intercostal indrawing or intercostal retractions), the child does not have chest indrawing. In this assessment, chest indrawing is lower chest wall indrawing. This is the same as "subcostal indrawing" or "subcostal retractions." It does not include "intercostal indrawing."</p>

                        </aside>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">LOOK and LISTEN for stridor</h3>
                        <p>Stridor is a harsh noise made when the child breathes IN. Stridor happens when there is a swelling of the larynx, trachea or epiglottis. These conditions are often called croup. This swelling interferes with air entering the lungs. It can be life-threatening when the swelling causes the child's airway to be blocked. A child who has stridor when calm has a dangerous condition.</p>
                        <p>To look and listen for stridor, look to see when the child breathes IN. Then listen for stridor. Put your ear near the child's mouth because stridor can be difficult to hear. Sometimes you will hear a wet noise if the child's nose is blocked. Clear the nose, and listen again. A child who is not very ill may have stridor only when he is crying or upset. Be sure to look and listen for stridor when the child is calm.</p>
                        <p>You may hear a wheezing noise when the child breathes OUT. This is not stridor.</p>

                        <p>CLASSIFY means to make a decision about the severity of the illness. For each of the child's main symptoms, you will select a category, or "classification," that corresponds to the severity of the disease. Classifications are not exact disease diagnoses. Instead, they are categories that are used to determine appropriate action or treatment.</p>
                        <p>Each classification table on the ASSESS AND CLASSIFY chart lists clinical signs of illness and their classifications. The tables are divided into three columns titled signs, classify as, and treatment. Most classification tables also have three rows. If the chart is printed in colour, each row is coloured pink, yellow or green. The coloured rows signify the severity of the illness.</p>
                        <p>To use a classification table, start at the top of the SIGNS column on the left side of the table. Read down the column and decide if the child has the sign or not. When you reach a sign that the child has, stop. The child will be classified in that row. In this way, you will always assign the child to the more serious classification.</p>

                        <p>There are three possible classifications for a child with cough or difficult breathing: SEVERE PNEUMONIA OR VERY SEVERE DISEASE, PNEUMONIA, and NO PNEUMONIA: COUGH OR COLD (see Example 4). To classify cough or difficult breathing:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Look at the signs in the pink (or top) row. Does the child have a general danger sign? Does the child have chest indrawing or stridor in a calm child? If the child has a general danger sign or any of the other signs listed in the pink row, select the severe classification, SEVERE PNEUMONIA OR VERY SEVERE DISEASE.</li>
                            <li>If the child does not have the severe classification, look at the yellow (or second) row. Does the child have fast breathing? If the child has fast breathing, a sign in the yellow row, and the child does not have the severe classification, select the classification in the yellow row, PNEUMONIA.</li>
                            <li>If the child does not have any of the signs in the pink or yellow row, look at the green (or bottom) row, and select the classification NO PNEUMONIA: COUGH OR COLD.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">SEVERE PNEUMONIA OR VERY SEVERE DISEASE</h3>
                        <p>A child with cough or difficult breathing and with any of the following signs -- any general danger sign, chest indrawing or stridor in a calm child -- is classified as having SEVERE PNEUMONIA OR VERY SEVERE DISEASE.</p>
                        <p>A child with chest indrawing usually has severe pneumonia. Or the child may have another serious acute lower respiratory infection such as bronchiolitis, pertussis, or a wheezing problem. Chest indrawing develops when the lungs become stiff. The effort the child needs to breathe in is much greater than normal.</p>
                        <p>A child with chest indrawing has a higher risk of death from pneumonia than the child who has fast breathing and no chest indrawing. If the child is tired, and if the effort the child needs to expand the stiff lungs is too great, the child's breathing slows down. Therefore, a child with chest indrawing may not have fast breathing. Chest indrawing may be the child's only sign of severe pneumonia.</p>
                        <p>A child classified as having SEVERE PNEUMONIA OR VERY SEVERE DISEASE is seriously ill. He or she needs urgent referral to a hospital for treatments such as oxygen, a bronchodilator, or injectable antibiotics. Before the child leaves, give the first dose of an appropriate antibiotic. The antibiotic helps prevent severe pneumonia from becoming worse. It also helps treat other serious bacterial infections such as sepsis or meningitis. In Parts IV and V you will read about how to identify and give urgent pre-referral treatments.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">PNEUMONIA</h3>
                        <p>A child with cough or difficult breathing who has fast breathing and no general danger signs, no chest indrawing and no stridor when calm is classified as having PNEUMONIA.</p>
                        <p>A child with PNEUMONIA needs treatment with an appropriate antibiotic. In Parts IV, V and VI you will read about how to identify and give an appropriate antibiotic, and how to teach caretakers to give treatments at home.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">NO PNEUMONIA: COUGH OR COLD</h3>
                        <p>A child with cough or difficult breathing who has no general danger signs, no chest indrawing, no stridor when calm and no fast breathing is classified as having NO PNEUMONIA: COUGH OR COLD.</p>
                        <p>A child with NO PNEUMONIA: COUGH OR COLD does not need an antibiotic. The antibiotic will not relieve the child's symptoms. It will not prevent the cold from developing into pneumonia. Instead, give the mother advice about good home care.</p>
                        <p>A child with a cold normally improves in one to two weeks. However, a child who has a chronic cough (a cough lasting more than 30 days) may have tuberculosis, asthma, whooping cough or another problem. A child with a chronic cough needs to be referred to hospital for further assessment.</p>

                        <p>As you assess and classify cough or difficult breathing, circle the signs found and write the classification on the case recording form (see Example 5).</p>

                        <p>The health worker checked Fatima for general danger signs. The mother said that Fatima is able to drink. She has not been vomiting. She has not had convulsions during this illness. The health worker asked, "Does Fatima seem unusually sleepy?" The mother said, "Yes." The health worker clapped his hands. He asked the mother to shake the child. Fatima opened her eyes, but did not look around. The health worker talked to Fatima, but she did not watch his face. She stared blankly and appeared not to notice what was going on around her.</p>
                        <p>The health worker asked the mother to lift Fatima's shirt. He then counted the number of breaths the child took in a minute. He counted 41 breaths per minute. The health worker did not see any chest indrawing. He did not hear stridor.</p>
