                        <p>The cells of the human body require a constant stream of oxygen to stay alive. The respiratory system provides oxygen to the body's cells while removing carbon dioxide, a waste product that can be lethal if allowed to accumulate.</p>
                        <p>There are 3 major parts of the respiratory system: the airway, the lungs, and the muscles of respiration. The airway, which includes the nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, carries air between the lungs and the body's exterior.</p>
                        <p>The lungs act as the functional units of the respiratory system by passing oxygen into the body and carbon dioxide out of the body. Finally, the muscles of respiration, including the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, work together to act as a pump, pushing air into and out of the lungs during breathing.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lung parenchyma caused by various microorganisms, including bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses. Pneumonias are classified as community acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired (nosocomial) pneumonia (HAP), pneumonia in the immunocompromised host, and aspiration pneumonia.</p>
                        <p>Those at risk for pneumonia often have chronic underlying disorders, severe acute illness, a suppressed immune system from disease or medications, immobility, and other factors that interfere with normal lung protective mechanisms. The elderly are also at high risk.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>An inflammatory reaction can occur in the alveoli, producing an exudate that interferes with the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide; bronchospasm may also occur if the patient has reactive airway disease.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Bronchopneumonia</strong>, the most common form, is distributed in a patchy fashion extending from the bronchi to surrounding lung parenchyma.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lobar pneumonia</strong> is the term used if a substantial part of one or more lobes is involved.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Pneumonias are caused by a variety of microbial agents in the various settings. Common organisms include Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella species; Staphylococcus aureus; Haemophilus influenzae; Staphylococcus pneumoniae; and enteric Gram-negative bacilli, fungi, and viruses (most common in children).</p>

                            <li>Sudden chills and rapidly rising fever (38.5¬∞C to 40.5¬∞C [101¬∞F to 105¬∞F]).</li>

                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_14_51a5847845a1f9c667c7g-028-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing a pneumothorax, where air has entered the pleural space causing the lung to collapse." class="content-image">
                        <p>Pneumothorax occurs when the parietal or visceral pleura is breached and the pleural space is exposed to positive atmospheric pressure. Normally the pressure in the pleural space is negative or subatmospheric; this negative pressure is required to maintain lung inflation.</p>
                        <p>When either pleura is breached, air enters the pleural space, and the lung or a portion of it collapses. Hemothorax is the collection of blood in the chest cavity because of torn intercostal vessels or laceration of the lungs injured through trauma. Often both blood and air are found in the chest cavity (hemopneumothorax).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Types of Pneumothorax</h3>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Simple Pneumothorax</h4>
                        <p>A simple, or spontaneous, pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space through a breach of either the parietal or visceral pleura. Most commonly this occurs as air enters the pleural space through the rupture of a bleb or a bronchopleural fistula. A spontaneous pneumothorax may occur in an apparently healthy person in the absence of trauma due to rupture of an air-filled bleb, or blister, on the surface of the lung, allowing air from the airways to enter the pleural cavity. It may be associated with diffuse interstitial lung disease and severe emphysema.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Traumatic Pneumothorax</h4>
                        <p>A traumatic pneumothorax occurs when air escapes from a laceration in the lung itself and enters the pleural space or from a wound in the chest wall. It may result from blunt trauma (eg, rib fractures), penetrating chest or abdominal trauma (eg, stab wounds or gunshot wounds), or diaphragmatic tears. It may also occur during invasive thoracic procedures. Open pneumothorax is one form of traumatic pneumothorax. It occurs when a wound in the chest wall is large enough to allow air to pass freely in and out of the thoracic cavity with each attempted respiration.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Tension Pneumothorax</h4>
                        <p>A tension pneumothorax occurs when air is drawn into the pleural space and is trapped with each breath. Tension builds up in the pleural space, causing lung collapse. Mediastinal shift (shift of the heart and great vessels and trachea toward the unaffected side of the chest) is a life-threatening medical emergency. Both respiratory and circulatory functions are compromised.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pleuritic pain of sudden onset.</li>
                            <li>Minimal respiratory distress with small pneumothorax; acute respiratory distress if large.</li>
                            <li>Anxiety, dyspnea, air hunger, use of accessory muscles, and central cyanosis (with severe hypoxemia).</li>
                            <li>In a simple pneumothorax, the trachea is midline, expansion of the chest is decreased, breath sounds may be diminished.</li>
                            <li>In a tension pneumothorax, the trachea is shifted away from the affected side, breath sounds are diminished or absent, and percussion to the affected side is hyperresonant. The clinical picture is one of air hunger, agitation, increasing hypoxemia, central cyanosis, hypotension, tachycardia, and profuse diaphoresis.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>A chest injury, also known as chest trauma, is any form of physical injury to the chest including the ribs, heart and lungs. Chest injuries account for 25% of all deaths from traumatic injury. Typically chest injuries are caused by blunt mechanisms such as motor vehicle collisions or penetrating mechanisms such as stabbings.</p>
                        <p>Chest injuries can be classified as blunt or penetrating. Blunt and penetrating injuries have different pathophysiologies and clinical courses.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                        <p>The injured area is usually tender or painful. Pain is worse when people inhale. The chest may be bruised. Sometimes people are short of breath. If the injury is severe, they may feel very short of breath, drowsy, or confused, and the skin may be cold, sweaty, or blue. Such symptoms may develop when the lungs malfunction severely (respiratory failure) or people are in shock.</p>
                        <p>Other symptoms depend on the specific chest injury. For example, sometimes air accumulates under the skin in people with pneumothorax. Affected skin feels crackly and makes a crackling sound when touched. The veins in the neck are sometimes enlarged if cardiac tamponade or tension pneumothorax develops.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
                        <p>Most blunt injuries are managed with relatively simple interventions like tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation and chest tube insertion. Diagnosis of blunt injuries may be more difficult and require additional investigations such as CT scanning. Penetrating injuries often require surgery.</p>
                        <p>The treatment goal is to support breathing and circulation and treat the specific injury. People may be given oxygen, intravenous fluids, or blood transfusions. For some injuries, a chest tube must be inserted to drain blood (hemothorax) or air (pneumothorax).</p>
