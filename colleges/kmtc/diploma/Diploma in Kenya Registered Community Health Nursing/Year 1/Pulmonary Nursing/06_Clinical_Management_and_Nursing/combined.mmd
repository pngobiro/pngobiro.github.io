Respiratory infections can occur in any part of the respiratory tract such as the nose, throat, larynx, trachea, air passages or lungs. A child with cough or difficult breathing may have pneumonia or another severe respiratory infection. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs. Both bacteria and viruses can cause pneumonia. In developing countries, pneumonia is often due to bacteria. The most common are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae. Children with bacterial pneumonia may die from hypoxia (too little oxygen) or sepsis (generalized infection).

Many children are brought to the clinic with less serious respiratory infections. Most children with cough or difficult breathing have only a mild infection. For example, a child who has a cold may cough because nasal discharge drips down the back of the throat. Or the child may have a viral infection of the bronchi called bronchitis. These children are not seriously ill. They do not need treatment with antibiotics. Their families can manage them at home.

You need to identify the few, very sick children with cough or difficult breathing who need treatment with antibiotics. Fortunately, you can identify almost all cases of pneumonia by checking for these two clinical signs: fast breathing and chest indrawing.

When children develop pneumonia, their lungs become stiff. One of the body's responses to stiff lungs and hypoxia (too little oxygen) is fast breathing. When the pneumonia becomes more severe, the lungs become even stiffer. Chest indrawing may develop. Chest indrawing is a sign of severe pneumonia.

\subsection*{7.1. HOW TO ASSESS A CHILD WITH COUGH OR DIFFICULT BREATHING}

Moving down the left side of the ASSESS AND CLASSIFY chart, you find the first main symptom box. Each main symptom box contains two parts: an assessment section on the left side and a colour-coded classification table on the right. The assessment section lists questions and clinical signs under the headings ask, look, listen, check and feel.

Before entering a main symptom box, ask if the child has the main symptom. For example, ask, "Does the child have cough or difficult breathing?" If the answer is NO, leave the box and move down the chart to the next main symptom box. If the answer is YES, ask the questions and check the clinical signs in the assessment section of the box. Then follow the classify arrow across the page to the classification table.

For ALL sick children:
ASK: Does the child have cough or difficult breathing?
Difficult breathing is any unusual pattern of breathing. Mothers describe this in different ways. They may say that their child's breathing is "fast" or "noisy" or "interrupted."

If the mother answers NO, look to see if you think the child has cough or difficult breathing. If the child does not have cough or difficult breathing, ask about the next main symptom, diarrhoea. Do not assess the child further for signs related to cough or difficult breathing.

If the mother answers YES, ask the next question.
- ASK: For how long?

A child who has had cough or difficult breathing for more than 30 days has a chronic cough. This may be a sign of tuberculosis, asthma, whooping cough or another problem.
- COUNT the breaths in one minute

You must count the breaths the child takes in one minute to decide if the child has fast breathing. The child must be quiet and calm when you look and listen to his breathing. If the child is frightened, crying or angry, you will not be able to obtain an accurate count of the child's breaths.

Tell the mother you are going to count her child's breathing. Remind her to keep her child calm. If the child is sleeping, do not wake the child. To count the number of breaths in one minute. Use a watch with a second hand or a digital watch. Look for breathing movement anywhere on the child's chest or abdomen.

Usually you can see breathing movements even on a child who is dressed. If you cannot see this movement easily, ask the mother to lift the child's shirt. If the child starts to cry, ask the mother to calm the child before you start counting. If you are not sure about the number of breaths you counted (for example, if the child was actively moving and it was difficult to watch the chest, or if the child was upset or crying), repeat the count.

The cut-off for fast breathing depends on the child's age. Normal breathing rates are higher in children age 2 months up to 12 months than in children age 12 months up to 5 years. For this reason, the cut-off for identifying fast breathing is higher in children 2 months up to 12 months than in children age 12 months up to 5 years.
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline If the child is: & The child has fast breathing if you count: \\
\hline 2 months up to 12 months: & $\mathbf{5 0}$ breaths per minute or more \\
12 months up to 5 years: & $\mathbf{4 0}$ breaths per minute or more. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Note: The child who is exactly 12 months old has fast breathing if you count 40 breaths per minute or more.

Before you look for the next two signs -- chest indrawing and stridor -- watch the child to determine when the child is breathing IN and when the child is breathing OUT.

\section*{- LOOK for chest indrawing}

If you did not lift the child's shirt when you counted the child's breaths, ask the mother to lift it now.

Look for chest indrawing when the child breathes IN. Look at the lower chest wall (lower ribs). The child has chest indrawing if the lower chest wall goes IN when the child breathes IN. Chest indrawing occurs when the effort the child needs to breathe in is much greater than normal. In normal breathing, the whole chest wall (upper and lower) and the abdomen move OUT when the child breathes IN. When chest indrawing is present, the lower chest wall goes IN when the child breathes IN.

If you are not sure that chest indrawing is present, look again. If the child's body is bent at the waist, it is hard to see the lower chest wall move. Ask the mother to change the child's position so he is lying flat in her lap. If you still do not see the lower chest wall go IN when the child breathes IN, the child does not have chest indrawing. For chest indrawing to be present, it must be clearly visible and present all the time. If you only see chest indrawing when the child is crying or feeding, the child does not have chest indrawing.

If only the soft tissue between the ribs goes in when the child breathes in (also
called intercostal indrawing or intercostal retractions), the child does not have chest indrawing. In this assessment, chest indrawing is lower chest wall indrawing. This is the same as "subcostal indrawing" or "subcostal retractions." It does not include "intercostal indrawing."

\section*{[Insert Illustration of Chest Indrawing]}

\section*{- LOOK and LISTEN for stridor}

Stridor is a harsh noise made when the child breathes IN. Stridor happens when there is a swelling of the larynx, trachea or epiglottis. These conditions are often called croup. This swelling interferes with air entering the lungs. It can be lifethreatening when the swelling causes the child's airway to be blocked. A child who has stridor when calm has a dangerous condition.

To look and listen for stridor, look to see when the child breathes IN. Then listen for stridor. Put your ear near the child's mouth because stridor can be difficult to hear. Sometimes you will hear a wet noise if the child's nose is blocked. Clear the nose, and listen again. A child who is not very ill may have stridor only when he is crying or upset. Be sure to look and listen for stridor when the child is calm.

You may hear a wheezing noise when the child breathes OUT. This is not stridor.

\subsection*{7.2 HOW TO CLASSIFY COUGH OR DIFFICULT BREATHING}

CLASSIFY means to make a decision about the severity of the illness. For each of the child's main symptoms, you will select a category, or "classification," that corresponds to the severity of the disease. Classifications are not exact disease diagnoses. Instead, they are categories that are used to determine appropriate action or treatment.

Each classification table on the ASSESS AND CLASSIFY chart lists clinical signs of illness and their classifications. The tables are divided into three columns titled signs, classify as, and treatment. Most classification tables also have three rows. If the chart is printed in colour, each row is coloured pink, yellow or green. The coloured rows signify the severity of the illness.

To use a classification table, start at the top of the SIGNS column on the left side of the table. Read down the column and decide if the child has the sign or not. When you reach a sign that the child has, stop. The child will be classified in that row. In this way, you will always assign the child to the more serious classification.

Example 4: Classification table for cough or difficult breathing.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline SIGNS & CLASSIFY AS & \begin{tabular}{l}
IDENTIFY TREATMENT \\
(Urgent pre-referral treatments are in bold print.)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}

- Stridor in calm child.
\end{tabular} & SEVERE PNEUMONIA OR VERY SEVERE DISEASE & \begin{tabular}{l}

$\square$ Refer URGENTLY to hospital.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline - Fast breathing & PNEUMONIA & \begin{tabular}{l}
$\square$ Give an appropriate oral antibiotic for 5 days. \\
$\square$ Soothe the throat and relieve the cough with a safe remedy. \\
$\square$ Advise mother when to return immediately. \\
$\square$ Follow-up in 2 days.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline No signs of pneumonia or very severe disease. & NO PNEUMONIA: COUGH OR COLD & \begin{tabular}{l}
$\square$ If coughing more than 30 days, refer for assessment. \\
$\square$ Soothe the throat and relieve the cough with a safe remedy. \\
$\square$ Advise mother when to return immediately. \\
$\square$ Follow-up in 5 days if not improving.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

There are three possible classifications for a child with cough or difficult breathing: SEVERE PNEUMONIA OR VERY SEVERE DISEASE, PNEUMONIA, and NO PNEUMONIA: COUGH OR COLD (see Example 4). To classify cough or difficult breathing:
1. Look at the signs in the pink (or top) row. Does the child have a general danger sign? Does the child have chest indrawing or stridor in a calm child? If the child has a general danger sign or any of the other signs listed in the pink row, select the severe classification, SEVERE PNEUMONIA OR VERY SEVERE DISEASE.
2. If the child does not have the severe classification, look at the yellow (or second) row. Does the child have fast breathing? If the child has fast breathing, a sign in the yellow row, and the child does not have the severe classification, select the classification in the yellow row, PNEUMONIA.
3. If the child does not have any of the signs in the pink or yellow row, look at the green (or bottom) row, and select the classification NO PNEUMONIA: COUGH OR COLD.

The classifications for cough or difficult breathing can be described as follows:

\section*{SEVERE PNEUMONIA OR VERY SEVERE DISEASE}

A child with cough or difficult breathing and with any of the following signs -- any general danger sign, chest indrawing or stridor in a calm child -- is classified as having SEVERE PNEUMONIA OR VERY SEVERE DISEASE.

A child with chest indrawing usually has severe pneumonia. Or the child may have another serious acute lower respiratory infection such as bronchiolitis, pertussis, or a wheezing problem. Chest indrawing develops when the lungs become stiff. The effort the child needs to breathe in is much greater than normal.

A child with chest indrawing has a higher risk of death from pneumonia than the child who has fast breathing and no chest indrawing. If the child is tired, and if the effort the child needs to expand the stiff lungs is too great, the child's breathing slows down. Therefore, a child with chest indrawing may not have fast breathing. Chest indrawing may be the child's only sign of severe pneumonia.

A child classified as having SEVERE PNEUMONIA OR VERY SEVERE DISEASE is seriously ill. He or she needs urgent referral to a hospital for treatments such as oxygen, a bronchodilator, or injectable antibiotics. Before the child leaves, give the first dose of an appropriate antibiotic. The antibiotic helps prevent severe pneumonia from becoming worse. It also helps treat other serious bacterial infections such as sepsis or meningitis. In Parts IV and V you will read about how to identify and give urgent pre-referral treatments.

\section*{PNEUMONIA}

A child with cough or difficult breathing who has fast breathing and no general danger signs, no chest indrawing and no stridor when calm is classified as having PNEUMONIA.

A child with PNEUMONIA needs treatment with an appropriate antibiotic. In Parts IV, V and VI you will read about how to identify and give an appropriate antibiotic, and how to teach caretakers to give treatments at home.

\section*{NO PNEUMONIA: COUGH OR COLD}

A child with cough or difficult breathing who has no general danger signs, no chest indrawing, no stridor when calm and no fast breathing is classified as having NO PNEUMONIA: COUGH OR COLD.

A child with NO PNEUMONIA: COUGH OR COLD does not need an antibiotic. The antibiotic will not relieve the child's symptoms. It will not prevent the cold from developing into pneumonia. Instead, give the mother advice about good home care.

A child with a cold normally improves in one to two weeks. However, a child who has a chronic cough (a cough lasting more than 30 days) may have tuberculosis, asthma, whooping cough or another problem. A child with a chronic cough needs to be referred to hospital for further assessment.

As you assess and classify cough or difficult breathing, circle the signs found and write the classification on the case recording form (see Example 5).

CASE 1: Fatima is 18 months old. She weighs 11.5 kg . Her temperature is $37.5{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The health worker asked, "What are the child's problems?" The mother said "Fatima has been coughing for 6 days, and she is having trouble breathing." This is the initial visit for this illness.

The health worker checked Fatima for general danger signs. The mother said that Fatima is able to drink. She has not been vomiting. She has not had convulsions during this illness. The health worker asked, "Does Fatima seem unusually sleepy?" The mother said, "Yes." The health worker clapped his hands. He asked the mother to shake the child. Fatima opened her eyes, but did not look around. The health worker talked to Fatima, but she did not watch his face. She stared blankly and appeared not to notice what was going on around her.

The health worker asked the mother to lift Fatima's shirt. He then counted the number of breaths the child took in a minute. He counted 41 breaths per minute. The health worker did not see any chest indrawing. He did not hear stridor.

- We will introduce the new pneumonia guidelines - all protocol books before 2016 are out of date!

\section*{Target patient}
- Cough or difficulty breathing in a patient aged 259months
- The pneumonia guideline should be applied cautiously in the following patients:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Assessment & Action /cause \\
\hline Cough or fever more than 14 days & Consider TB \\
\hline Exposure to TB or chronic cough & Consider TB \\

\section*{Admission or discharge for pneumonia with in - drawing?}
- A child with cough or difficulty breathing with lower chest wall indrawing BUT no danger signs can safely be managed as an outpatient
- If review at 48 hours can be conducted at a clinic
- If the family can bring the child sooner for any deterioration - careful counseling on danger signs that should prompt early return must be given
- Is there another illness that makes admission necessary?
-What is the HIV status?
- Is there severe acute malnutrition?
-What are the benefits of oral OPD therapy?

\section*{MODULE OUTCOMES.}
- BY THE END OF THE MODULE THE LEARNER SHOULD:
1. MANAGE PATIENTS WITH RESTRICTIVE RESPIRATORY DISORDERS USING THE NURSING PROCESS.
2. MANAGE PATIENTS WITH OBTRUCTIVE RESPIRATORY DISORDERS USING THE NURSING PROCESS.

\section*{Intro.}
1. The cells of the human body require a constant stream of oxygen to stay alive. The respiratory system provides oxygen to the body's cells while removing carbon dioxide, a waste product that can be lethal if allowed to accumulate.

\section*{Intro.}
- There are 3 major parts of the respiratory system: the airway, the lungs, and the muscles of respiration. The airway, which includes the nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, carries air between the lungs and the body's exterior.

1. The lungs act as the functional units of the respiratory system by passing oxygen into the body and carbon dioxide out of the body. Finally, the muscles of respiration, including the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, work together to act as a pump, pushing air into and out of the lungs during breathing.

\section*{PNEUMONIA.}
- Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lung parenchyma caused by various microorganisms, including bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses. Pneumonias are classified as community acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired (nosocomial) pneumonia (HAP), pneumonia in the immunocompromised host, and aspiration pneumonia.

\section*{Cont.}
- Those at risk for pneumonia often have chronic underlying disorders, severe acute illness, a suppressed immune system from disease or medications, immobility, and other factors that interfere with normal lung protective mechanisms. The elderly are also at high risk.

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- An inflammatory reaction can occur in the alveoli, producing an exudate that interferes with the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide; bronchospasm may also occur if the patient has reactive airway disease.

\section*{Cont.}
1. Bronchopneumonia, the most common form, is distributed in a patchy fashion extending from the bronchi to surrounding lung parenchyma. Lobar pneumonia is the term used if a substantial part of one or more lobes is involved.

\section*{Cont.}
1. Pneumonias are caused by a variety of microbial agents in the various settings. Common organisms include Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella species; Staphylococcus aureus; Haemophilus influenzae; Staphylococcus pneumoniae; and enteric Gram-negative bacilli, fungi, and viruses (most common in children).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

Clinical features vary depending on the causative organism and the patient's disease.
- Sudden chills and rapidly rising fever (38.5C to 40.5C [101F to 105F]).
- Pleuritic chest pain aggravated by respiration and coughing.
- Severely ill patient has marked tachypnea (25 to 45 breaths/min) and dyspnea; orthopnea when not propped up.
- Pulse rapid and bounding; may increase 10 beats/ min per degree of temperature elevation (Celsius).
- A relative bradycardia for the amount of fever suggests viral infection, mycoplasma infection, or infection with a Legionella organism.

\section*{Cont.}

0 Other signs: upper respiratory tract infection, headache, low-grade fever, pleuritic pain, myalgia, rash, and pharyngitis; after a few days, mucoid or mucopurulent sputum is expectorated.
- Sputum purulent, rusty, blood-tinged, viscous, or green depending on etiologic agent.
(1) Appetite is poor, and the patient is diaphoretic and tires easily.

\section*{Diagnostic Methods}
- Primarily history, physical examination
- Chest x-rays, blood and sputum cultures, Gram stain

\section*{Medical Management.}
- Antibiotics are prescribed on the basis of Gram stain results and antibiotic guidelines.
- Supportive treatment includes hydration, antipyretics, antitussive medications, antihistamines, or nasal decongestants.
- Bed rest is recommended until infection shows signs of clearing.
- Oxygen therapy is given for hypoxemia.

\section*{Cont.}
- Respiratory support includes high inspiratory oxygen concentrations, endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation.
- Treatment of atelectasis, pleural effusion, shock, respiratory failure, or superinfection is instituted, if needed.
- For groups at high risk for CAP, pneumococcal vaccination is advised.

\section*{Possible nursing diagnoses.}
- Ineffective airway clearance related to copious tracheobronchial secretions
- Activity intolerance related to impaired respiratory function
- Risk for deficient fluid volume related to fever and a rapid respiratory rate
- Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements
- Deficient knowledge about treatment regimen and preventive health measures

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{1. IMPROVING AIRWAY PATENCY}
- Encourage hydration: fluid intake (2 to $3 \mathrm{~L} /$ day) to loosen secretions.
- Provide humidified air using high-humidity face mask.
- Encourage patient to cough effectively, and provide correct positioning, chest physiotherapy, and incentive spirometry.

\section*{Cont.}
- Provide nasotracheal suctioning if necessary.
- Provide appropriate method of oxygen therapy.
- Monitor effectiveness of oxygen therapy.

\section*{2. PROMOTING REST AND CONSERVING ENERGY}
- Encourage the debilitated patient to rest and avoid overexertion and possible exacerbation of symptoms.
- Patient should assume a comfortable position to promote rest and breathing (eg, semi-Fowler's position).

\section*{Cont.}
- Instruct outpatients not to overexert themselves and to engage in only moderate activity during the initial phases of treatment.

\section*{3. PROMOTING FLUID INTAKE AND MAINTAINING NUTRITION}
- Encourage fluids ( 2 L /day minimum with electrolytes and calories).
- Administer IV fluids and nutrients, if necessary.

\section*{Cont.}

\section*{4. PROMOTING PATIENTS' KNOWLEDGE}
- Instruct on cause of pneumonia, management of symptoms, signs and symptoms that should be reported to the physician or nurse, and the need for follow-up.
- Explain treatments in simple manner and using appropriate language
- Repeat instructions and explanations as needed.

\section*{Cont.}
- Pneumothorax occurs when the parietal or visceral pleura is breached and the pleural space is exposed to positive atmospheric pressure. Normally the pressure in the pleural space is negative or subatmospheric; this negative pressure is required to maintain lung inflation.

\section*{Cont.}
- When either pleura is breached, air enters the pleural space, and the lung or a portion of it collapses. Hemothorax is the collection of blood in the chest cavity because of torn intercostal vessels or laceration of the lungs injured through trauma. Often both blood and air are found in the chest cavity (hemopneumothorax).

\section*{Types of Pneumothorax}

\section*{Simple Pneumothorax}
- A simple, or spontaneous, pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space through a breach of either the parietal or visceral pleura. Most commonly this occurs as air enters the pleural space through the rupture of a bleb or a bronchopleural fistula.

\section*{Cont.}
1. A spontaneous pneumothorax may occur in an apparently healthy person in the absence of trauma due to rupture of an air-filled bleb, or blister, on the surface of the lung, allowing air from the airways to enter the pleural cavity. It may be associated with diffuse interstitial lung disease and severe emphysema.

\section*{Traumatic Pneumothorax}
1. A traumatic pneumothorax occurs when air escapes from a laceration in the lung itself and enters the pleural space or from a wound in the chest wall. It may result from blunt trauma (eg, rib fractures), penetrating chest or abdominal trauma (eg, stab wounds or gunshot wounds), or diaphragmatic tears.

\section*{Cont.}
- Traumatic pneumothorax may occur during invasive thoracic procedures (ie, thoracentesis, transbronchial lung biopsy, insertion of a subclavian line) in which the pleura is inadvertently punctured, or with barotrauma from mechanical ventilation. A traumatic pneumothorax resulting from major injury to the chest is often accompanied by hemothorax.

\section*{Cont.}

1 Open pneumothorax is one form of traumatic pneumothorax. It occurs when a wound in the chest wall is large enough to allow air to pass freely in and out of the thoracic cavity with each attempted respiration.

\section*{Tension Pneumothorax}
- A tension pneumothorax occurs when air is drawn into the pleural space and is trapped with each breath. Tension builds up in the pleural space, causing lung collapse. Mediastinal shift (shift of the heart and great vessels and trachea toward the unaffected side of the chest) is a life-threatening medical emergency. Both respiratory and circulatory functions are compromised.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}
- Signs and symptoms associated with pneumothorax depend on its size and cause:
- Pleuritic pain of sudden onset.
- Minimal respiratory distress with small pneumothorax; acute respiratory distress if large.
- Anxiety, dyspnea, air hunger, use of accessory muscles, and central cyanosis (with severe hypoxemia).

\section*{Cont.}
- In a simple pneumothorax, the trachea is midline, expansion of the chest is decreased, breath sounds may be diminished, and percussion of the chest may reveal normal sounds or hyperresonance depending on the size of the pneumothorax.

\section*{Cont.}
- In a tension pneumothorax, the trachea is shifted away from the affected side, chest expansion may be decreased or fixed in a hyperexpansion state, breath sounds are diminished or absent, and percussion to the affected side is hyperresonant. The clinical picture is one of air hunger, agitation, increasing hypoxemia, central cyanosis, hypotension, tachycardia, and profuse diaphoresis.

\section*{Medical Management}
- The goal is evacuation of air or blood from the pleural space.
- A small chest tube is inserted near the second intercostal space for a pneumothorax.
- A large-diameter chest tube is inserted, usually in the fourth or fifth intercostal space, for hemothorax.
- Autotransfusion is begun if excessive bleeding from chest tube occurs.

\section*{Cont.}
- Traumatic open pneumothorax is plugged (petroleum gauze); patient is asked to inhale and strain against a closed glottis to eject air from the thorax until the chest tube is inserted, with water-seal drainage.

\section*{Cont.}
- Antibiotics are usually prescribed to combat infection from contamination.
- The chest wall is opened surgically (thoracotomy) if more than $1,500 \mathrm{~mL}$ of blood is aspirated initially by thoracentesis (or is the initial chest tube output) or if chest tube output continues at greater than $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$. Urgency is determined by the degree of respiratory compromise.

\section*{Cont.}
- An emergency thoracotomy may also be performed in the emergency department if a cardiovascular injury secondary to chest or penetrating trauma is suspected.
- The patient with a possible tension pneumothorax should immediately be given a high concentration of supplemental oxygen to treat the hypoxemia, and pulse oximetry should be used to monitor oxygen saturation.

\section*{Cont.}
- In an emergency situation, a tension pneumothorax can be decompressed or quickly converted to a simple pneumothorax by inserting a large-bore needle ( 14 -gauge) at the second intercostal space, midclavicular line on the affected side. A chest tube is then inserted and connected to suction to remove the remaining air and fluid, reestablish the negative pressure, and reexpand the lung.

\section*{Nursing Management}
- Promote early detection through assessment and identification of high-risk population; report symptoms.
- Assist in chest tube insertion; maintain chest drainage or water-seal.

\section*{Cont.}
- Monitor respiratory status and re-expansion of lung, with interventions (pulmonary support) performed in collaboration with other health care professionals (e. g, physician, respiratory therapist, physical therapist).
- Provide information and emotional support to patient and family.

\section*{CHEST INJURY}
- A chest injury, also known as chest trauma, is any form of physical iniury to the chest including the ribs, heart and lungs. Chest injuries account for $25 \%$ of all deaths from traumatic injury. Typically chest injuries are caused by blunt mechanisms such as motor vehicle collisions or penetrating mechanisms such as stabbings

\section*{Cont.}
- Chest injuries can be classified as blunt or penetrating. Blunt and penetrating injuries have different pathophysiologies and clinical courses.
- Specific types of injuries include:

\section*{Cont.}
- Specific types of injuries include:
1. Injuries to the chest wall

Chest wall contusions or hematomas.
- Rib fractures
$\square$ Flail chest
0 Sternal fractures
(Fractures of the shoulder girdle

Cont.
2.Pulmonary injury (injury to the lung) and injuries involving the pleural space
- Pulmonary contusion
1. Pulmonary laceration
- Pneumothorax
- Hemothorax
- Hemopneumothorax

\section*{Cont.}
3. Injury to the airways
- Tracheobronchial tear
4.Cardiac injury
- Pericardial tamponade
- Myocardial contusion
- Traumatic arrest
- Hemopericardium

Cont.
5.Blood vessel injuries
- Traumatic aortic rupture
- Thoracic aorta injury
- Aortic dissection
6. And injuries to other structures within the torso
- Esophageal iniury (Boerhaave syndrome)
- Diaphragm iniury

\section*{Clinical manifestations.}
- The injured area is usually tender or painful. Pain is worse when people inhale. The chest may be bruised. Sometimes people are short of breath. If the injury is severe, they may feel very short of breath, drowsy, or confused, and the skin may be cold, sweaty, or blue. Such symptoms may develop when the lungs malfunction severely (respiratory failure) or people are in shock.

\section*{Cont.}
- People in shock typically have dangerously low blood pressure and feel as if their heart is racing.
- Other symptoms depend on the specific chest injury. For example, sometimes air accumulates under the skin in people with pneumothorax. Affected skin feels crackly and makes a crackling sound when touched.

\section*{Cont.}
- The veins in the neck are sometimes enlarged if blood or fluid accumulates in the sac around the heart and interferes with the heart's ability to pump blood (called cardiac tamponade) or if tension pneumothorax develops.

\section*{Diagnosis.}
- Most blunt injuries are managed with relatively simple interventions like tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation and chest tube insertion.
Diagnosis of blunt injuries may be more difficult and require additional investigations such as CT scanning.

\section*{Cont.}
1. Penetrating injuries often require surgery, and complex investigations are usually not needed to come to a diagnosis. Patients with penetrating trauma may deteriorate rapidly, but may also recover much faster than patients with blunt injury.

\section*{Treatment.}

The goal is to:
- Support of breathing and circulation
- Treatment of the specific injury

Injuries that are immediately life threatening are treated as quickly as possible. The specific treatment depends on the injury.

\section*{Cont.}
- For all injuries, doctors take measures to support breathing and circulation if necessary. People may be given oxygen (for example, by nasal prongs, by face mask, or through a breathing tube) and intravenous fluids or sometimes blood transfusions. People with severe chest injuries are admitted to the hospital.

\section*{Cont.}
(1) People may be given pain relievers (analgesics) to lessen pain.
- For some injuries, a tube must be inserted into the chest (thoracostomy, or chest tube insertion) to drain blood (in hemothorax) or air (in pneumothorax) from the chest. This procedure helps collapsed lungs reinflate. Insertion can usually be done using only local anesthesia.

\section*{CARCINOMA OF THE IUNGS.}
- Lung cancers arise from a single transformed epithelial cell in the tracheobronchial airways. A carcinogen (cigarette smoke, radon gas, other occupational and environmental agents) damages the cell, causing abnormal growth and development into a malignant tumor.

\section*{Cont.}
1. Most lung cancers are classified into one of two major categories: small cell lung cancer ( $15 \%$ to 20\% of tumors) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; approximately 80\% of tumors).

\section*{Cont.}
- Risk factors include tobacco smoke, second-hand (passive) smoke, environmental and occupational exposures, gender, genetics, and dietary deficits. Other factors that have been associated with lung cancer include genetic predisposition and underlying respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and tuberculosis (TB).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}
- Lung cancer often develops insidiously and is asymptomatic until late in its course.
- Signs and symptoms depend on location, tumor size, degree of obstruction, and existence of metastases to regional or distant sites.
- Most common symptom is cough or change in a chronic cough.

\section*{Cont.}
- Dyspnea may occur early in the disease.
- Hemoptysis or blood-tinged sputum may be expectorated.
- Chest pain or shoulder pain may indicate chest wall or pleural involvement. Pain is a late symptom and may be related to bone metastasis.
- Recurring fever may be an early symptom.

\section*{Cont.}
- Chest pain, tightness, hoarseness, dysphagia, head and neck edema, and symptoms of pleural or pericardial infusion exist if the tumor spreads to adjacent structures and lymph nodes.
- Common sites of metastases are lymph nodes, bone, brain, contralateral lung, adrenal glands, and liver.
- Weakness, anorexia, and weight loss may appear.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Methods}
- Chest x-ray, CT scans, bone scans, abdominal scans, PET scans, liver ultrasound, and MRI.
- Sputum examinations, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, transthoracic fine-needle aspiration, endoscopy with esophageal ultrasound, mediastinoscopy or mediastinotomy, and biopsy.
- Pulmonary function tests, ABG analysis scans, and exercise testing.

\section*{Medical Management}
- The objective of management is to provide a cure if possible. Treatment depends on cell type, stage of the disease, and physiologic status.
- Treatment may involve surgery (preferred), radiation therapy, or chemotherapy-or a combination of these. Newer and more specific therapies to modulate the immune system (gene therapy, therapy with defined tumor antigens) are under study and show promise.

\section*{Assignment.}
- Review nursing management of a cancer patient.

\section*{PLEURISY}
- Pleurisy refers to inflammation of both the visceral and parietal pleurae. When inflamed, pleural membranes rub together, the result is severe, sharp, knifelike pain with breathing that is intensified on inspiration.

\section*{Cont.}
- Pleurisy may develop in conjunction with pneumonia or an upper respiratory tract infection, TB, or collagen disease; after trauma to the chest, pulmonary infarction, or pulmonary embolism (PE); in patients with primary or metastatic cancer; and after thoracotomy.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations.}
- Pain usually occurs on one side and worsens with deep breaths, coughing, or sneezing.
- Pain is decreased when the breath is held. Pain is localized or radiates to the shoulder or abdomen.
- As pleural fluid develops, pain lessens. A friction rub can be auscultated but disappears as fluid accumulates.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Methods}
- Auscultation for pleural friction rub
- Chest x-rays
- Sputum culture
- Thoracentesis for pleural fluid examination, pleural biopsy (less common)

\section*{Medical Management}

Objectives of management are to discover the underlying condition causing the pleurisy and to relieve the pain.
1. Patient is monitored for signs and symptoms of pleural effusion: shortness of breath, pain, assumption of a position that decreases pain, and decreased chest wall excursion.

\section*{Cont.}
- Prescribed analgesics, such as NSAIDs, are given to relieve pain and allow effective coughing.
- Applications of heat or cold are provided for symptomatic relief.
- An intercostal nerve block is done for severe pain.

\section*{Nursing Management}
- Enhance comfort by turning patient frequently on affected side to splint chest wall.
- Teach patient to use hands or pillow to splint rib cage while coughing.
- See "Nursing Management" under "Pneumonia" for additional information.

\section*{CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE(COPD)}

COPD is a disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles or gases, resulting in narrowing of airways, hypersecretion of mucus, and changes in the pulmonary vasculature.

\section*{Cont.}

Other diseases such as cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and asthma that were previously classified as types of COPD are now classified as chronic pulmonary disorders, although symptoms may overlap with those of COPD. Cigarette smoking, air pollution, and occupational exposure (coal, cotton, grain) are important risk factors that contribute to COPD development, which may occur over a 20- to 30year span.

\section*{Cont.}

Complications of COPD vary but include respiratory insufficiency and failure (major complications) as well as pneumonia, atelectasis, and pneumothorax.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}
- COPD is characterized by chronic cough, sputum production, and dyspnea on exertion; often worsen over time.
- Weight loss is common.
- Symptoms are specific to the disease. See "Clinical Manifestations" under "Asthma," "Bronchiectasis," "Bronchitis," and "Emphysema."

\section*{Medical Management}
- Smoking cessation, if appropriate.
- Bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and other drugs leg, alpha 1 -antitrypsin augmentation therapy, antibiotic agents, mucolytic agents, antitussive agents, vasodilators, narcotics). Vaccines may also be effective.
- Oxygen therapy, including nighttime oxygen.

\section*{Cont.}
- Varied treatments specific to disease. See "Medical Management" under "Asthma," "Bronchiectasis," "Bronchitis," and "Emphysema."
- Surgery: bullectomy to reduce dyspnea; lung volume reduction to improve lobar elasticity and function; lung transplantation.

\section*{Nursing management.}

\section*{1. Achieving Airway Clearance}
- Monitor the patient for dyspnea and hypoxemia.
- If bronchodilators or corticosteroids are prescribed, administer the medications properly and be alert for potential side effects.

\section*{Cont.}
- Encourage patient to eliminate or reduce all pulmonary irritants, particularly cigarette smoking.
- Instruct the patient in directed or controlled coughing.
- Chest physiotherapy with postural drainage, intermittent positive-pressure breathing, increased fluid intake, and bland aerosol mists (with normal saline solution or water) may be useful for some patients with COPD.

\section*{2.Improving Breathing Patterns}
- Inspiratory muscle training and breathing retraining may help improve breathing patterns.
- Training in diaphragmatic breathing reduces the respiratory rate, increases alveolar ventilation, and sometimes helps expel as much air as possible during expiration.

\section*{Cont.}
- Pursed-lip breathing helps slow expiration, prevent collapse of small airways, and control the rate and depth of respiration; it also promotes relaxation.

\section*{3.Improving Activity Tolerance}
- Evaluate the patient's activity tolerance and limitations and use teaching strategies to promote independent activities of daily living.
- Determine if patient is a candidate for exercise training to strengthen the muscles of the upper and lower extremities and to improve exercise tolerance and endurance.

\section*{Cont.}
- Recommend use of walking aids, if appropriate, to improve activity levels and ambulation.
- Consult with other health care professionals (rehabilitation therapist, occupational therapist, physical therapist) as needed.

\section*{4.Monitoring and Managing Complications}
- Assess patient for complications (respiratory insufficiency and failure, respiratory infection, and atelectasis).
- Monitor for cognitive changes, increasing dyspnea, tachypnea, and tachycardia.
- Monitor pulse oximetry values and administer oxygen as prescribed.

\section*{Cont.}
- Instruct patient and family about signs and symptoms of infection or other complications and to report changes in physical or cognitive status.
- Encourage patient to be immunized against influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia.

\section*{Cont.}
- Caution patient to avoid going outdoors if the pollen count is high or if there is significant air pollution and to avoid exposure to high outdoor temperatures with high humidity.

\section*{Cont.}
- If a rapid onset of shortness of breath occurs, quickly evaluate the patient for potential pneumothorax by assessing the symmetry of chest movement, differences in breath sounds, and pulse oximetry.

\section*{BRONCHITIS, CHRONIC}
- Chronic bronchitis, a disease of the airways, is defined as the presence of cough and sputum production for at least 3 months in each of two consecutive years. Although, chronic bronchitis is a clinically and epidemiologically useful term, it does not reflect the major impact of airflow limitation on morbidity and mortality in COPD.

\section*{Cont.}
- In many cases, smoke or other environmental pollutants irritate the airways, resulting in inflammation and hypersecretion of mucus. Constant irritation causes the mucus-secreting glands and goblet cells to increase in number, leading to increased mucus production.

\section*{Cont.}
- Mucus plugging of the airway reduces ciliary function. Bronchial walls also become thickened, further narrowing the bronchial lumen. Alveoli adjacent to the bronchioles may become damaged and fibrosed, resulting in altered function of the alveolar macrophages.

\section*{Cont.}
- This is significant because the macrophages play an important role in destroying foreign particles, including bacteria. As a result, the patient becomes more susceptible to respiratory infection.

\section*{Cont.}
- A wide range of viral, bacterial, and mycoplasmal infections can produce acute episodes of bronchitis. Exacerbations of chronic bronchitis are most likely to occur during the winter when viral and bacterial infections are more prevalent.

\section*{Nursing Management}
- Management, see under management of COPD

\section*{EMPHYSEMA, PULMONARY}
- In emphysema, impaired oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange results from destruction of the walls of over distended alveoli. "Emphysema" is a pathologic term that describes an abnormal distention of the air spaces beyond the terminal bronchioles and destruction of the walls of the alveoli.

\section*{Cont.}
- This is the end stage of a process that progresses slowly for many years. As the walls of the alveoli are destroyed (a process accelerated by recurrent infections), the alveolar surface area in direct contact with the pulmonary capillaries continually decreases. This causes an increase in dead space (lung area where no gas exchange can occur) and impaired oxygen diffusion, which leads to hypoxemia.

\section*{Cont.}
- In the later stages of disease, carbon dioxide elimination is impaired, resulting in increased carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood (hypercapnia) leading to respiratory acidosis. As the alveolar walls continue to break down, the pulmonary capillary bed is reduced in size. Consequently, resistance to pulmonary blood flow is increased, forcing the right ventricle to maintain a higher blood pressure in the pulmonary artery.

\section*{Cont.}
1. Hypoxemia may further increase pulmonary artery pressures. For this reason, right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale) is one of the complications of emphysema. Congestion, dependent edema, distended neck veins, or pain in the region of the liver suggests the development of cardiac failure.

\section*{Cont.}
- There are two main types of emphysema, based on the changes taking place in the lung. Both types may occur in the same patient. In the panlobular (panacinar) type of emphysema, there is destruction of the respiratory bronchiole, alveolar duct, and alveolus.

\section*{Cont.}
- All air spaces within the lobule are essentially enlarged, but there is little inflammatory disease. A hyperinflated (hyperexpanded) chest, marked dyspnea on exertion, and weight loss typically occur. To move air into and out of the lungs, negative pressure is required during inspiration, and an adequate level of positive pressure must be attained and maintained during expiration.

\section*{Cont.}
- Instead of being an involuntary passive act, expiration becomes active and requires muscular effort. In the centrilobular (centroacinar) form, pathologic changes take place mainly in the center of the secondary lobule, preserving the peripheral portions of the acinus.

\section*{Cont.}
- Frequently, there is a derangement of ventilationperfusion ratios, producing chronic hypoxemia, hypercapnia, polycythemia, and episodes of rightsided heart failure. This leads to central cyanosis and respiratory failure. The patient also develops peripheral edema, which is treated with diuretic therapy.

\section*{Nursing Management}
- See "Nursing Management" under "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease" for additional information.

\section*{ASTHMA}
1. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by hyperresponsiveness, mucosal edema, and mucus production. This inflammation ultimately leads to recurrent episodes of asthma symptoms: cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and dyspnea.

\section*{Cont.}
1. Patients with asthma may experience symptom-free periods alternating with acute exacerbations that last from minutes to hours or days. Asthma, the most common chronic disease of childhood, can begin at any age.
- Risk factors for asthma include family history, allergy (strongest factor), and chronic exposure to airway irritants or allergens (eg, grass, weed pollens, mold, dust, or animals). Common triggers for asthma symptoms and exacerbations include airway irritants leg, pollutants, cold, heat, strong odors, smoke, perfumes),

\section*{Cont.}
- exercise, stress or emotional upset, rhinosinusitis with postnasal drip, medications, viral respiratory tract infections, and gastroesophageal reflux.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}
- Most common symptoms of asthma are cough (with or without mucus production), dyspnea, and wheezing (first on expiration, then possibly during inspiration as well).
- Asthma attacks frequently occur at night or in the early morning.
- An asthma exacerbation is frequently preceded by increasing symptoms over days, but it may begin abruptly.

\section*{Cont.}
- Chest tightness and dyspnea occur.
- Expiration requires effort and becomes prolonged.
- As exacerbation progresses, central cyanosis secondary to severe hypoxia may occur.
- Additional symptoms, such as diaphoresis, tachycardia, and a widened pulse pressure, may occur.

\section*{Cont.}
- Exercise-induced asthma: maximal symptoms during exercise, absence of nocturnal symptoms, and sometimes only a description of a "choking" sensation during exercise.
- A severe, continuous reaction, status asthmaticus, may occur. It is life-threatening.
- Eczema, rashes, and temporary edema are allergic reactions that may be noted with asthma.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Methods}
- Family, environment, and occupational history is essential.
- During acute episodes, sputum and blood test, pulse oximetry, ABGs, hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis, and pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume [FEV] and forced vital capacity [FVC] decreased) tests are performed.

\section*{Medical Management}

\section*{Pharmacologic Therapy}
- There are two classes of medications-long-acting control and quick-relief medications-as well as combination products.

\section*{Cont.}
- Short-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists-e.g salbutamol
- Anticholinergics-e.g ipratropium (Atrovent), and atropine
- Corticosteroids: metered-dose inhaler (MDI) e.g Prednisone and hydrocortisone

\section*{Cont.}
- Leukotriene modifiers inhibitors/antileukotrienes
- Methylxanthines

\section*{Nursing Management}
1. The immediate nursing care of patients with asthma depends on the severity of symptoms. The patient and family are often frightened and anxious because of the patient's dyspnea. Therefore, a calm approach is an important aspect of care.

\section*{Cont.}
- Assess the patient's respiratory status by monitoring the severity of symptoms, breath sounds, peak flow, pulse oximetry, and vital signs.
- Obtain a history of allergic reactions to medications before administering medications.

\section*{Cont.}
- Identify medications the patient is currently taking.
- Administer medications as prescribed and monitor the patient's responses to those medications; medications may include an antibiotic if the patient has an underlying respiratory infection.

\section*{Cont.}
- Administer fluids if the patient is dehydrated.
- Assist with intubation procedure, if required.

\section*{Cont.}
- Teach patient and family about asthma (chronic inflammatory), purpose and action of medications, triggers to avoid and how to do so, and proper inhalation technique.
- Instruct patient and family about peak-flow monitoring.

\section*{Cont.}
- Refer patient to community support groups.
- Remind patients and families about the importance of health promotion strategies and recommended health screening.

\section*{ASTHMA: STATUS ASTHMATICUS}
- Status asthmaticus is severe and persistent asthma that does not respond to conventional therapy; attacks can occur with little or no warning and can progress rapidly to asphyxiation. Infection, anxiety, nebulizer abuse, dehydration, increased adrenergic blockage, and nonspecific irritants may contribute to these episodes.

\section*{Cont.}
- An acute episode may be precipitated by hypersensitivity to aspirin. Two predominant pathologic problems occur: a decrease in bronchial diameter and a ventilation-perfusion abnormality.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}
- Same as those in severe asthma.
- No correlation between severity of attack and number of wheezes; with greater obstruction, wheezing may disappear, possibly signaling impending respiratory failure.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}
- Primarily pulmonary function studies and ABG analysis
- Respiratory alkalosis most common finding

\section*{Medical Management}
- Initial treatment: beta2-adrenergic agonists, corticosteroids, supplemental oxygen and IV fluids to hydrate patient. Sedatives are contraindicated.
- High-flow supplemental oxygen is best delivered using a partial or complete non-rebreather mask ( PaO 2 at a minimum of 92 mm Hg or O 2 saturation greater than 95\%).

\section*{Cont.}
- Magnesium sulfate, a calcium antagonist, may be administered to induce smooth muscle relaxation.
- Hospitalization if no response to repeated treatments or if blood gas levels deteriorate or pulmonary function scores are low.
- Mechanical ventilation if patient is tiring or in respiratory failure or if condition does not respond to treatment.

\section*{Nursing Management}
1. The main focus of nursing management is to actively assess the airway and the patient's response to treatment. The nurse should be prepared for the next intervention if the patient does not respond to treatment.

\section*{Cont.}
- Constantly monitor the patient for the first 12 to 24 hours, or until status asthmaticus is under control. Blood pressure and cardiac rhythm should be monitored continuously during the acute phase and until the patient stabilizes and responds to therapy.

\section*{Cont.}
- Assess the patient's skin turgor for signs of dehydration; fluid intake is essential to combat dehydration, to loosen secretions, and to facilitate expectoration.
- Administer IV fluids as prescribed, up to 3 to 4 L/ day, unless contraindicated.

\section*{Cont.}
- Encourage the patient to conserve energy.
- Ensure patient's room is quiet and free of respiratory irritants (eg, flowers, tobacco smoke, perfumes, or odors of cleaning agents); nonallergenic pillows should be used.

\section*{BRONCHIECTASIS}
- Bronchiectasis is a condition where the bronchial tubes of your lungs are permanently damaged, widened, and thickened. These damaged air passages allow bacteria and mucus to build up and pool in your lungs. This results in frequent infections and blockages of the airways.

\section*{Cont.}
- Bronchiectasis may be caused by a variety of conditions, including airway obstruction, diffuse airway injury, pulmonary infections and obstruction of the bronchus or complications of long-term pulmonary infections, genetic disorders (eg, cystic fibrosis), abnormal host defense (eg, ciliary dyskinesia or humoral immunodeficiency), and idiopathic causes.

\section*{Cont.}
0. Bronchiectasis is usually localized, affecting a segment or lobe of a lung, most frequently the lower lobes. People may be predisposed to bronchiectasis as a result of recurrent respiratory infections in early childhood, measles, influenza, tuberculosis, or immunodeficiency disorders.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}
- Chronic cough and production of copious purulent sputum
- Hemoptysis, clubbing of the fingers, and repeated episodes of pulmonary infection

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}
- Definite diagnostic clue is prolonged history of productive cough, with sputum consistently negative for tubercle bacilli.
- Diagnosis is established on the basis of CT scan.

\section*{Medical Management}
- Treatment objectives are to promote bronchial drainage to clear excessive secretions from the affected portion of the lungs and to prevent or control infection.
- Chest physiotherapy with percussion; postural drainage, expectorants, or bronchoscopy to remove bronchial secretions.

\section*{Cont.}
- Antimicrobial therapy guided by sputum sensitivity studies.
- Year-round regimen of antibiotics, alternating types of drugs at intervals.
- Vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia
- Bronchodilators.
- Smoking cessation.

\section*{Cont.}
- Surgical intervention (segmental resection of lobe or lung removal), used infrequently.
- In preparation for surgery: vigorous postural drainage, suction through bronchoscope, and antibacterial therapy.

\section*{Nursing Management}
- See "Nursing Management and Patient Education" under "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease" in Chapter C and "Preoperative and Postoperative Nursing Management" in Chapter P for additional information.

\section*{BRONCHIOLITIS}
- Bronchiolitis is a common lung infection in young children and infants. It causes inflammation and congestion in the small airways (bronchioles) of the lung. Bronchiolitis is almost always caused by a virus. Typically, the peak time for bronchiolitis is during the winter months.

\section*{Cont.}
- Bronchiolitis starts out with symptoms similar to those of a common cold but then progresses to coughing, wheezing and sometimes difficulty breathing. Symptoms of bronchiolitis can last for several days to weeks, even a month.
- Most children get better with care at home. A very small percentage of children require hospitalization.

\section*{Clinical manifestation}

For the first few days, the signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to those of a cold:
- Runny nose

1 Stuffy nose
- Cough
- Slight fever (not always present)

\section*{Cont.}
* After this, there may be a week or more of difficulty breathing or a whistling noise when the child breathes out (wheezing).
- Many infants will also have an ear infection (otitis media).

\section*{Causes}
- Bronchiolitis occurs when a virus infects the bronchioles, which are the smallest airways in your lungs. The infection makes the bronchioles swell and become inflamed. Mucus collects in these airways, which makes it difficult for air to flow freely in and out of the lungs.

\section*{Cont.}
- Most cases of bronchiolitis are caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV is a common virus that infects just about every child by the age of 2. Outbreaks of the RSV infection occur every winter. Bronchiolitis can also be caused by other viruses, including those that cause the flu or the common cold. Infants can be reinfected with RSV because at least two strains exist.

\section*{Diagnosis}
1. Tests and X-rays are not usually needed to diagnose bronchiolitis. The doctor can usually identify the problem by observing your child and listening to his or her lungs with a stethoscope. However, it may take more than one or two visits to distinguish the condition from a cold or the flu.

\section*{Cont.}

If your child is at risk of severe bronchiolitis, if symptoms are worsening or if another problem is suspected, your doctor may order tests, including:
- Chest X-ray. Your doctor may request a chest X-ray to look for signs of pneumonia

Cont.
- Viral testing. Your doctor may collect a sample of mucus from your child to test for the virus causing bronchiolitis. This is done using a swab that's gently inserted into the nose.

\section*{Cont.}

Blood tests. Occasionally, blood tests might be used to check your child's white blood cell count. An increase in white blood cells is usually a sign that the body is fighting an infection. A blood test can also determine whether the level of oxygen has decreased in your child's bloodstream.

\section*{Treatment.}
- Bronchiolitis typically lasts for two to three weeks. The majority of children with bronchiolitis can be cared for at home with supportive care. It's important to be alert for changes in breathing difficulty, such as struggling for each breath, being unable to speak or cry because of difficulty breathing, or making grunting noises with each breath.

\section*{Cont.}
- Because viruses cause bronchiolitis, antibiotics which are used to treat infections caused by bacteria - aren't effective against it. If your child has an associated bacterial infection, such as pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic for that.

\section*{Cont.}
1. Oral corticosteroid medications and pounding on the chest to loosen mucus (chest physiotherapy) have not been shown to be effective treatments for bronchiolitis and are not recommended.

\section*{Cont.}
1. A tiny percentage of children need hospital care to manage their condition. At the hospital, your child may receive humidified oxygen to maintain sufficient oxygen in the blood, and perhaps fluids through a vein (intravenously) to prevent dehydration.

\section*{Cont.}
1. Maintain a smoke-free environment. Smoke can aggravate symptoms of respiratory infections. If a family member smokes, ask him or her to smoke outside of the house and outside of the car.

\section*{MAJOR SYMPTOMS OF RESPIRATORY DISEASES}

\section*{DYSPNEA}
- Difficulty in breathing or labored breathing or shortness of Breath.
- Is a symptom common to many pulmonary and cardiac disorders, particularly when there is decreased lung compoliance or increased airueay resistance. E.g in asthma
- It may also be associated weith neurologic or neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis and Guillain-Barré syndrome

\section*{Clinical Significance}
- Acute diseases of the lungs produce a more severe grade of dyspnea than chronic diseases.
- Sudden dyspnea in a healthy person may indicate pneumothorax, acute respiratory obstruction, or Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).
- In immobilized patients, sudden dyspnea may denote pulmonary embolism.
- Orthopnea may be found in patients weith heart disease and occasionally in patients with COPD;
- dyspnea with an expiratory wheeze occurs with COPD.

\section*{COUGH}
- Results from irritation of the mucous membranes anywhere in the respiratory tract. by smoke, dust, or a gas.
- Cough is the chief protection mechanism against the accumulation of secretions in the bronchi and Bronchioles.

Clinical Significance.
- Cough may indicate serious pulmonary disease.
- Described as dry, hacking, productive or severe.
- A dry, irritative cough is characteristic of an upper respiratory tract infection

\section*{Cont..}
- Infection of viral origin causes an irritative, highpitched cough.
- Pleuritic chest pain accompanying coughing may indicate pleural incolvement.
- Cough in the morning weith sputum indicate Bronchitis
- Cough after food may indicate aspoiration in the tracheal bronchial tree

\section*{SPUJUM PRODUCTION}
- Sputum production is the reaction of the lungs to any constantly recurring irritant.

\section*{Clinical Significance}
- A profuse amount of purulent sputum or a change in color of the sputum probably indicates a bacterial infection.
- Thin, mucoid sputum Prequently results Prom wiral Bronchitis.
- Foul smelling sputum indicate indicate lung abcess or bronchiectasis

\section*{CHEST PAIN}
- May be associated with pulmonary or cardiac disease.
- Chest pain associated with pulmonary conditions may be sharr, stabbing, and intermittent, or it may be dull, aching, and persistent.
- The pain usually is pelt on the side where the pathologic process is located, but it may be referred elsewhere-for example, to the neck, back, or abdomen.

\section*{Clinical Significance.}
- Chest pain may occur with pneumonia, pulmonary embolism with lung infarction, and pleurisy.
- Pleuritic pain is sharp and intensily on inspiration.

\section*{WHEEWING -}
- is often the major finding in a patient weith bronchoconstriction or airway narrowing.
- It is a high-pitched, musical sound heard mainly on exporation. Common in asthma
- Relief Measures: Oral or inhalant Bronchodilator medications reverse wheezing in most instances.

\section*{CLUBBING OF THE FINGERS -}
- Is a sign of lung disease found in patients weith chronic hypoxic conditions, chronic lung infections, and malignancies of the lung.
- Manifested initially as loss of the nail bed angle

\section*{HEMOPTYSIS}
- Is the expectoration of blood from the respiratory tract
- is a common symptom of pulmonary and cardiac disorders

The most common causes are:
- Pulmonary infection
- Carcinoma of the lung
- Abnormalities of the heart or blood wessels
- Pulmonary emboli and infarction
- Chest trauma

\section*{CyANOSIS}
- Is a wery late indicator of hypoxia (oxygen deficiency in body tissues).
- The presence or absence of cyanosis is determined by the amount of unoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood.
Tues types:
- Central cyanosis is assessed by observing the color of the tongue and lips.
- Peripheral cyanosis results from decreased blood floue to a certain area of the body (e.g extremities)

\section*{DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES}
1. History and physical exam
2. Pulmonary Function Jests (PFJS)
- Are routinely used in patients with chronic respiratory disorders.
- Performed to assess respiratory function and to determine the extent of dysfunction. Such tests include measurements of lung wolumes, wentilatory function, and the mechanics of breathing, diffusion, and gas exchange.
- DFTs are useful in a patient with an established respiratory disease and assessing the response to therapy.

\section*{3. Arterial Blood Gases (ABSS)}
- Involves measurements of blood pH and of arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions.
- Arterial blood gas studies aid in assessing the ability of the lungs to provide adequate oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.
- Also involves the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb or excrete bicarbonate ions to maintain normal body pH.

\section*{4. Pulse Oximetry (SPO2)}
- Pulse oximetry is a method of continuously monitoring the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin
- A probe or sensor is attached to the fingertip, earlobe, or bridge of the nose.
- Normal Sp02 walues are 95\% to 100\%. Values less than 85\% indicate that the tissues are not receiving enough oxygen, and the patient needs further evaluation.

\section*{5. Sputum Studies}
- Sputum is obtained for analysis to identify pathogenic organisms and to determine whether malignant cells are present.
- It also may be used to assess for hypersensitivity states
- In general, sputum cultures are used in diagnosis, for drug sensitivity testing, and to guide treatment

\section*{6. Imaging Studies}
- This include x-rays, CT, MRI, Contrast studies, pulmonary angiography etc

\section*{7. Endoscopic Procedures}
- Bronchoscopy is the direct inspection and examination of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi using a bronchoscope
- Thoracoscopy is a diagnostic procedure in which the pleural cauity is examined wiith an endoscope. It is primarily indicated in the diagnostic evaluation of pleural effusions and pleural disease

\section*{8. Thoracentesis -}
- Aspiration of Pluid Prom the chest by centesis for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes
- (centesis is the act of puncturing a body cauity or organ with a hollow needle in order to draw out Pluid)

\section*{9. Biopsy}
- The excision of a small amount of tissue, may be performed to permit examination of cells Prom the pharynx, larynx, and nasal passages.

PNEUMONIA

Definition: Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lung parenchyma (the cells and tissues concerned with lung Punctions), caused by various microorganisms, including bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and eiruses.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF PNEUMONIA}

Pneumonia is classilied according to:
i) The predisposing eneironment.
ii) The pattern of damage executed in the lungs.

\section*{Classification of preumonia according to the predisposing endironment:}
i) Community acquired pneumonia
ii) Hospital acquired pneumonia
iii) Pneumonia in the immunocompromised patient
iue) Aspiration pneumonia

\section*{1. COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA (CAP)}
- Is pneumonia occurring in the community setting or weithin the first 48 hours after hospitalization
- The causative agents for CAP that requires hospitalization include Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Legionella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Mycoptasma pneumonia .
- This pneumonia may occur as lobar or as Bronchopneumonia in patients of any age and may Polloue a recent respiratory illness.
- S. pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the most common cause of CAP in people younger than 60 years of age weithout co-morbidity, and in those 60 years and older with co-morbidity.
- Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in infants and children but are relatively uncommon causes of CAP in adults.

\section*{2. HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA (HAP)}
- HAP, also known as nosocomial pneumonia, is defined as the onset of preumonia symptoms more than 48 hours after hospital admission in patients with no evidence of infection at the time of admission.
- It is the most lethal nosocomial infection and is the leading cause of death in patients with such infections.

\section*{Predisposing factors to hospital-acquired preumonia:}
i) Impaired host delenses (malnutrition, immunocompromised patients are at particular risk).
ii) Co-morbid conditions (e.g. metabolic disorders e.g Diabetes, sewere acute or chronic illnesses).
iii) Prolonged hospitalization (transmission of pathogens by the hands of health care personnel).
vi) Intervention-related factors also may play a role in the development of HAP:
- Prolonged or inappropriate use of antibiotics.
- Use of nasogastric tubes.
- Endotracheal intubation.

Common causative organisms for HAP include $\mathcal{E}$. coli, H. influenzae, Klebsiella species, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-sensitive or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) , and S. preumoniae.

\section*{3. PJEUNOJLA IN THE IJINUUNOCOJTPROJTISED HOST}

Occurs due to:
i) Prolonged use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents.
ii) Chemotherapy.
iii) Nutritional depletion.
iie) Prolonged use of broad spectrum antibiotics.
e) Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
vi) Genetic immune disorders.
wii) Long-term advanced life-support technology (mechanical wentilation).
- Pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts includes Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), Pungal pneumonias etc
- The organisms responsible for CAP and HAP can also cause pneumonia in the immunocompromised hosts.
- PCP is rarely observed in immunocompetent hosts and is often an initial AIDS-defining complication.
4. ASPIRATION PREUMONIA
- Aspiration pneumonia refers to the pulmonary consequences resulting from entry of endogenous or exogenous substances into the lower airway.
- Aspiration pneumonia can occur in the community or in the hospital setting.

\section*{Forms of aspiration pneumonia include:}
i) Aspiration of bacteria that reside in the upper airways, leading to infection. Common pathogens are S. preumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. aureus.
ii) Substances other than bacteria aspirated into the lungs, such as gastric contents
- These substances impair lung defenses, cause inflammatory changes, and lead to bacterial grouth resulting in preumonia.

\section*{Classification of pneumonia according to the pattern of damage executed in the lungs:}
i) Lobar pneumonia: Refers to the pneumonia in which a substantial portion of one or more lobes of the lungs is incolled.
ii) Bronchopneumonia: The disease is distributed in a patchy Pashion, originating Prom one or more localized areas within the bronchi and extending to the adjacent surrounding lung parenchyma. (lung tissue)

\section*{LOBAR PNEUMONIA ws BRONCHOPNEUMONIA}

\section*{Lobar pneumonia}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_14_ffa9e6a5e4c0b732d9b5g-046.jpg?height=1138&width=1987&top_left_y=352&top_left_x=621)

In lobar pneumonia, an entire lobe is consolidated, while in bronchopneumonia, patchy areas of consolidation occur.

\section*{RISK FACTORS TO PNEUMONIA}
1. Conditions that produce mucus or Bronchial obstruction and interfere with normal lung drainage (eg, cancer, cigarette smoking and COPD).
2. Immunosuppression
3. Cigarette smoking; cigarette smoke disrupts both mucociliary and macrophage activity.
4. Prolonged immobility
5. Subsequent placement of nasogastric or endotracheal tubes.
6. Depressed cough rellex (eg, in weak respiratory muscles);
7. Aspiration of foreign material into the lungs during periods of unconsciousness (head injury, anesthesia, altered level of consciousness), or abnormal suealloueing mechanism.
8. Alcohol intoxication: Alcohol suppresses the body's rellexes leading to aspiration. It also decreases tracheobronchial ciliary motion.
9. Advanced age, because of possible depressed cough and glottic rellexes and nutritional depletion.

\section*{10. Respiratory therapy with improperly sterilized equipment. \\ 11. Transmission of organisms from health care providers.}

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF PNEUMONIA}
- Preumonia is an inflammation of the lung parenchyma caused by earious microorganisms (bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and wiruses), most common being $S$. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, $S$. aureus, and Dneumocystis jirollecii.
- It arises from normal Plora present in patients with altered immunity or from aspiration of flora present in the oropharynx due to acute or chronic underlying disease that impairs host defenses.
- Preumonia may also result from bloodborne organisms that enter the pulmonary circulation and are trapped in the pulmonary capillary bed.
- The inveasion of lung tissues with bacteria and eiruses alfects gaseous exchange, through an inflammatory reaction that occur in the bronchi and in the alleeoli causing formation of inflammatory exudate.
- White blood cells, mostly neutrophils, migrate into the alweoli and pill the normally air-pilled spaces. The mucosal edema and the exudate (secretions) causes partial occlusion of the bronchi and the alweoli. The exudate also interferes with the diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.
- All these results in poor wentilation of the lung parenchyma
- Bronchial exudate production leads to mucoid or mucopurulent sputum production while the airway irritation causes reflex coughing.
- As a compensatory mechanism to tissue hypoperfusion, breath rates increases to between 25 and $45 \mathrm{~b} / \mathrm{min}$, causing shortness of breath
- With improper or delayed treatment, pneumonia can complicate to pleural elfusion, hypotension, shock and respiratory Pailure.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF PNEUMONIA}
- Shaking chills
- Fever
- Dry cough
- Muscle aches
- Nausea/leomiting
- Rapid breathing
- Rapid heartbeat
- Difficulty Breathing
- Chest pain

\section*{ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES}
i) Patient history: positive history of a recent respiratory tract infection.
ii) Physical examination: reveals percussion dullness; crackles on auscultation reveals Pluid in narroue airueays.
iii) Chest x-rays: reveals areas of opacity which represent lung tissue consolidation.
iv) Blood culture to reveal bacteremia.
v) Pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas analysis is used to determine the patient's oxygenation and acid-base status.
oi) Sputum examination (for microscopy or culture). wii) Bronchoscopy may reveal narrow inflamed and exudate-filled bronchials.

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF PMEUMONIA PHARTNACOTHERAPY}

\section*{Antibiotic therapy}
i) Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin)
ii) Beta-lactam agent (cefpodoxime or cefuroxime)
iii) Fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, or levolloxacin)
ie) Aminoglycosides
u) In HAP or nosocomial preumonia with no known multidrug resistance, monotherapy with ceftriaxone, or with lewolloxacin is used.

\section*{Other management}
i) Hydration (with oral Pluids or intravenously if patient is NPO)
ii) Antipyretics (paracetamol) are used to treat headache and Pewer.
iii) Antitussive medications (codeine or dextromethorphan) are used for the associated cough.
ine) Bed rest is prescribed until the infection shouls signs of clearing.
w) Oxygen is administered if hypoxemia develops.

\section*{vi) Improving Airueay Patency:}
$\checkmark$ The nurse encourages hydration (2 to $3 \mathcal{L} /$ day), because adequate hydration thins and loosens pulmonary secretions.
$\checkmark$ Coughing can be initiated either coluntarily or by reflex. The nurse encourages the patient to perform an effective, directed cough
$\checkmark$ Chest physiotherapy (percussion) is important in loosening and mobilizing secretions.

\section*{oii) Oxygen administration}

Administer oxygen therapy as prescribed.
oilii) Promote rest and conserve patient energy
Place the patient in a comportable position to promote rest and breathing (eg, semi-Pouler's position)
ix) Maintaining adequate nutrition
x) Promoting patients' and Pamily knouledge on preumonia.
xi) Monitoring and managing potential compotications, such as shock, pleural epfusion, confusion and respiratory Pailure.

\section*{prevention OF pneumonia}
-Don't smoke.
$>$ Practice good hygiene.
- Stay rested and Pit.
- Appropriately treating underlying illnesses (such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition) can decrease the risk of pneumonia.
-Pneumonia Vaccination. (pneumococcal vaccine)

\section*{complicasiONs}
- Bacteria in the bloodstream (bacteremia)
$>$ Lung abscess.
- Build up of Pluid in the space between the lung and chest wall (rleural effusion).
$>$ Difficulty breathing.
-Shock and respiratory Pailure
-Septic arthritis
$>$ Endocarditis

P\&EURIS y

\section*{InTRODUCTION}
- Definition: Pleurisy is the Inflammation of the pleura of the lungs (especially the parietal layer)
- It is most often caused by a oiral infection.
- Various other lung disorders can also cause a 'pleuritic pain' similar to pleurisy.
- A pleuritic pain is a chest pain which is typically sharp and 'stabbing' in a part of the chest. The pain is usually made worse when breathing in or coughing.

\section*{A}
- Pleura are thin serous membrane around the lungs and inner walls of the chest. There are two layers.
- One layer lines the inside of the chest wall. The other layer covers the lungs.
- Between the two layers of pleura (the pleural cadity) , is a serous Pluid called pleural Pluid.
- This helps the lungs and chest wall to move smoothly when breathing.

- Inflammation of pleura usually resolves when the primary disease subsides
- Antibiotics Por bacterial infection
- Antiinflammatory drugs including aspirin, ibuprofen etc
- Prescription of pain and cough medication to promote comport.
- Medications to clear any blood clots e.g herarin
- Large collections of pus is then drained out via a tube (chest tube)

- Elealuate patient for signs of hypoxia

\section*{Easing Painful Respiration}
- Assist patient to find comportable position that will promote respiration; lying on affected side decreases stretching of the pleura and, therefore, the pain decreases.
- Instruct patient on sptinting the chest while taking a deep breath or coughing
- Administer pair medications as prescribed.
- Assist weith intercostal nerve block iP indicated.

\section*{compliCaTIONS}
- Severe pleural elfusion.
- Atelectasis (Collarse of an expanded lung)

CHEST INJURIES

\section*{Initial Assessment}
A. Airway with cervical spine protection
B. Breathing
C. Circulation with haemorrhage control
D. Disability or neurological status
E. Exposure and Environment - remove clothing, but keep warm

Recognition of (Clinical Features)
\& LOOK LISJEN FEEL

\section*{LOOK}
- Respiratory rate
- Shallou, gasping or laboured breathing: Respiratory Pailure?
- Cyanosis: Hypoxia
- Unequal chest inflation: Pneumothorax or Flail chest?
- Bruising or contusion: Seat-Belt' sign.
- Penetrating chest injury
- Distended neck weins: wenous return or cardiac tamponade **(cantiac ctamponade: Mechanical compression of the heart resulting from large amounts of fluid collecting in the previcardial space and limiting the heart's normal range of motion)

\section*{LISTEN}
- Absent breath sounds: Apnoea or tension pneumothorax
- Noisy breathing/Crepitations/Stridor/Wheeze: Partially obstructed airueay
- Reduced air entry: Pneumothorax, Haemothorax, Heamopnemothorax, Plail chest

\section*{FEES}
- Tracheal deneitation
- Tenderness: Chest wall contusion and/rib Practure

\section*{1. Rib Practure}
- $1^{\text {st }}$ and 2 nd ribs are protected by claivicle: when Practured it could be life threatening as trauma to the thoracic aorta, brachial plexus or subclaeian wein is likely.
- $11^{\text {th }}$ and $12^{\text {th }}$ ribs are floating ribs, usually not Practured
- Ribs in children are more elastic thus great Porce is needed to cause Practures

\section*{Types of trauma \\ a) CLOSED INJURY TO THE CHEST}
$\checkmark$ Direct trauma - Single or multiple ribs Practured at the point of contact
$\checkmark$ Crush injury - Usually causes Plail chest due to multiple sites of Practure of ribs (Flail chest: Loss of stability of chest weall as a result of multipote rib Practures)
$\checkmark$ Steering wheel injury - Common in head-on-collision accidents where fracture of sternum and bilateral Practures of ribs occur at costochondral junction
$\checkmark$ Minor trauma - In osteoporotic ribs, sometimes even a cough can cause a rib Practure

\section*{Clinical Peatures}
- In rib Practure without compotication: Pain while taking a deep breath and exaggerated pain during coughing
- Inspection: Bruising on skin
- Palpation: Bony irregularity, Tenderness and Crepitus
- X-ray usually shous a Practure rib but may miss a hairline Practure (tiny Practures)

\section*{Manangement of uncompticated rib Practure}
- Reduction of pain with 2 week polloue up
- Analgesics:
-Opiods
-NSAID's
- Strapping of chest: relieves pain by immobilizing the ribs
- Breathing exercises

\section*{2. Flail Chest}
- Definition: Loss of stability of chest weall as a result of multiple rib Practures
- "A flail chest segment is formed when turo or more consecutive ribs, with each rib being Practured at tue or more sites ${ }^{32}$
- Stowe-in-chest: "Depression of a portion of the chest wall due to severe chest injury, which contributes to forming a Plail segment."

\section*{Complications}
- The early mortality attributable to the Plail chest syndrome is due to:
- Massive haemothorax and Pulmonary contusion
- Whereas late mortality is largely due to:
- Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and associated infections.

\section*{Investigations}
1. Utital signs
2.Chest X-Ray
3. ECG
4.Pulse oximetry
5. Arterial Blood Gas
6. Fluid monitoring: urinary catheterization

\section*{Management}

- Minimise Purther lung injury (immobility)
- Secure and support the airueay as indicated
- Analgesia
- Mechanical ventilation
- Administration of humidified oxygen

- Definition1:Abnormal presence of air in the pleural caleity resulting in the collapse of the lung.
- Definition 1: A pneumothorax is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall

\section*{Mechanism:}
- In normal people, the pressure in pleural space is negative during the entire respiratory cycle.
- Tue opposite Porces result in negative pressure in pleural space.
(outward pull of the chest wall and elastic recoil of the lung)
- The negative pressure will disappear if any communication (space) develops.
- When a space develops between an ablueolus and pleural space, air weill flow into the pleural space until there is no longer a pressure difference or until the space is sealed.

\section*{Types of pneumothoraces}

\section*{i) Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (PSP)}
- A primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) tends to occur in young adults without underlying lung problems, and usually causes limited symptoms.
- Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting Peatures

\section*{ii) Secondary Spontaneous Pneumothoraces (SSPS)}
- Occur in individuals wiith significant underlying lung disease.
- Symptoms tend to be more severe than in PSP, as the unalpected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs.
- Hyroxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is manifested as cyanosis (blue discoloration of the lips and skin).

\section*{iii) Traumatic Pneumothorax}
- Traumatic pneumothorax most commonly occurs when the chest wall is pierced, such as when a stab wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the pleural space, or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises the integrity of the incolleed structures.

\section*{Tension Pneumothorax}
- Generally presents when a pneumothorax (primary spontaneous, secondary spontaneous, or traumatic) leads to significant impairment of respiration and/ or blood circulation.
- The most common findings: chest pain and respiratory distress, tachycardia, tachyrnea
Other findings may include:
- Quieter breath sounds on one side of the chest,
- Low oxygen levels and Love blood pressure,
- cyanosis
- Altered level of consciousness

\section*{Clinical types of Pneumothorax}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_14_ffa9e6a5e4c0b732d9b5g-102.jpg?height=1538&width=2215&top_left_y=328&top_left_x=397)

\section*{General Signs and symptoms}
- Breath sounds (with a stethoscope) may be diminished on the affected side.
- Percussion of the chest may be perceived as hyperresonant (like a booming drum).
- Dyspnea
- Chest pain (pleuritic pain)
- Rare signs and symptoms include: Cough, Hemoptysis, Cyanosis, Iachycardia

Physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small

\section*{Physical examination:}
- Depend on size of pneumothorax
- The vital signs usually normal
- Unilateral Chest movements
- The percussion note is hyper-resonant
- The breath sounds are reduced or absent on the affected side
- The lower edge of the liver may be shifted inferiorly with a right-side pneumothorax

Diagnostic procedures
- Xray, Ct scan, Ultrasound

\section*{Management}
- In TRAUMATIC PNEUMOJHORAX, chest tubes are usually inserted.
- If mechanical ventilation is required, the risk of tension pneumothorax is greatly increased and the insertion of a chest tube is mandatory.
- Any open chest wound should be covered wiith an airtight seal, as it carries a high risk of leading to tension pneumothorax.
- JENSION PNEUMOTHORAX is usually treated with urgent needle decompression.
- The needle or cannula is left in place until a chest tube can be inserted.

\section*{OTHER JREAJMENTS}

\section*{Aspiration}
- Reducing the size of pneumothorax by aspiration is equally effective as the insertion of a chest tube.
- This ineolves the administration of local anesthetic and inserting a needle connected to a three-way tap; up to 2.5 liters of air (in adults) are removed.

\section*{Chest tube}
- A chest tube (or intercostal drain) is the most definitive initial treatment of a pneumothorax.
- These are typically inserted in an area under the axilla (armpit) called the "safe triangle", where damage to internal organs can be awoided
- Local anesthetic is applied.

\section*{In Intercostal tube drainage}
- INDICATIONS
- Unstable pneumothorax
- Severe dyspnea
- fung collapse
- Open or tension pneumothorax
- Recurrent pneumothorax
- If Simple aspiration drainage is unsuccessful in controlling symptoms

\section*{Pleurodesis and surgery}
- Pleurodesis is a procedure that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall.
- Thoracotomy with identification of any source of air leakage is done followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining)

During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space.

\section*{Comptications of Pneumothorax}
- Hydropneumothorax.
- Hemopneumotorax

\section*{Assignment:}
1. Describe the nursing management of a patient with a chest tube drainage.
2. Read and write short notes on:
- Hemothorax

\section*{LUING CARCINOMA}

\section*{DEFINITION}
- Lung cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled cell grouth in tissues of the lung.
- If left untreated, this groueth can spread beyond the lung in a process called metastasis into nearby tissue and, eventually, into other parts of the body.

\section*{Signs and symptoms:}
- Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
- Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)
- Chronic coughing or change in regular coughing pattern
- Wheezing
- Chest pain
- Cachexia (weight loss),
- Fatigue
- Loss of appetite
- Clubbing of the fingernails (uncommon)
- Dysphagia (difficulty suealloueing)

\section*{Causes and risk Pactors:}

\section*{a) Smoking}
- Smoking, particularly of cigarettes, is by far the main contributor to lung cancer. Cigarette smoke contains over 60 known carcinogens.
- Additionally, nicotine appears to depress the immune response to malignant grouths in exposed tissue.
- Passive smoking - the inhalation of smoke from another's smoking-may be a cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers.
- 10-15\% of lung cancer patients have never smoked.

\section*{Smoker's lungs}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_14_ffa9e6a5e4c0b732d9b5g-117.jpg?height=1341&width=2248&top_left_y=335&top_left_x=184)

Non-smoker's lungs

\section*{b) Asbestos}
- Asbestos can cause a variety of lung diseases, including lung cancer.
c) Viruses
- Recent studies suggest wiral carcinogenic potential in humans.
- These wiruses may affect the cell cycle and inhibit apoptosis (programmed cell death), allouing uncontrolled cell division.
- Implicated viruses include:
- human papillomaairus.
- cytomegalouirus.

\section*{d) Air pollution}
- Indoor air pollution - by radon
- Radon is A radioactive gaseous element formed by the disintegration of radium; the heaviest of the inert gasses.
- Inhalation - causes bronchial deposition of radioactive decay products posing carcinogenic possibilities

\section*{Diagnosis:}
- Chest Radiograph: Look Por- An obleious mass and areas shouling atelectasis (collapse)
- If Blood stained sputum is present, but radiograph normal, then:
-Bronchoscopy
- CT Scan
- CT Scan guided biopsy(to find the tumor type)
-Sputum Cytologic examination

Squamous cell carcinoma

\section*{Classification:}
- Lung carcinomas classified according to histological types:
i. Small cell carcinoma
ii. Non-small-cell carcinoma:
- Squamous cell lung carcinoma
- Adenocarcinoma, and
- Large-cell lung carcinoma.

\section*{Metastasis:}
- The lung is a common place for metastasis of tumors from other parts of the body.
- Secondary cancers are classified by the site of origin; e.g., breast cancer that has spread to the lung is called breast cancer.

\section*{Management:}
- Surgical
- Non-surgical
- Radiotherapy
- Chemotherapy

\section*{Radiotherapy:}

Radiation the rapy works by damaging the DNA of cancerous cells.

\section*{Chemotherapy:}
- The chemotherapy regimen depends on the tumor type:
i) Small-cell lung carcinoma
- Cisplatin and Etoposide are most commonly used.
ii) Non-small-cell lung carcinoma
- Advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma is often treated with Cisplatin or Carboplatin, in combination with Gemcitabine.

\section*{Surgical Management}
* Lobectomy: In patients with adequate respiratory reserve this is preferred, as this minimizes the chance of local recurrence.
* Preumonectomy - Surgical removal of a lung (usually to treat lung cancer)

\section*{OBSTRUCTIVE RESPIRAJORY CONDITIONS}

BRONCHITIS

\section*{BRONCHITIS}
- Definition: Bronchitis is an inflammation or suelling of the Bronchial tubes (Bronchi)
- Individuals with bronchitis breathe less air and oxygen into their lungs; they also have heave mucus or phlegm (expectorated matter) Porming in their airways.
Causes
- Virus (more common)
- In most cases bronchitis is caused by the same beirus that cause the common cold or flu (influenza birus)

\section*{Pre desposing factors of Bronchitis}
- Smoking
- People who are exposed to a lot of second-hand smoke
- People with weakened immune systems
- The elderly and infants
- People with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - aspiration risks
- People who are exposed to air pollution
***Bronchitis may be ACUJE or CHRONIC

\section*{Acute Bronchitis.}
- Is characterized by the development of cough
- Acute bronchitis often occurs after a cold or Plu, as the result of bacterial infection, or from constant irritation of the bronchi by polluted air or chemical fumes in the eneironment.

\section*{Cont..}
- Also characterized by a slight peoer that may last Por a Pene days to weeks
- Acute bronchitis, symptoms usually resolve weithin 7 to 10 days, however, a dry, hacking cough can occur for several weeks.
- Acute bronchitis is more common and often serious in small children because their bronchi are smaller and more easily obstructed and also in the elderly.

\section*{Chronic Bronchitis.}
- Is a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) caused by chronic respiratory infections and chronic exposure to eneironmental pollutants and irritants
- As the condition gets ueorse, the person becomes increasingly affected by shortness of breath and may require supplemental oxygen.
- It may also include fever, presence of productive cough that last for 3 months or more per year.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY.}
- Short term irritation of respiratory tract leads to inflammation resulting in hyper secretion of mucus and initial dry irritating cough which later becomes productive.
- Continued bronchial irritation leads to chronic Bronchitis.
- Resulting in hypertrophy and hyperplasia of bronchial mucous glands and mucous producing goblet cells thus causing increased secretion by the Bronchial mucosa.
- Chronic infiltration of the bronchial wealls by leucocytes and lymphocytes occur making the Bronchial wall to become thickened and the Bronchial lumen to become narrowed thus interfering with the Plous of air to and Prom the lungs.
- The narrowed lumen often becomes plugged with the mucus. Because of the inflammatory process, the patient has pever with accompanying chills, headache, chest pain and loss of appetite

\section*{Signs And Symptoms Of Bronchitis}
- Cough.
- Wheezing.
- Throat pain.
- Difficulty in breathing .
- Chest discomport and soreness.
- Fatigue and headache.
- Fever
- Sueeating
- Nausea.

\section*{DIAGNOSTIC tests}
- History taking.
- Clinical manifestation.
- Physical examination.
- Chest x-ray (Reveal bronchoconstriction, hyperinllation and rounded diagram).
- Sputum culture reveals microorganisms
- Arterial blood gas analysis reveals Respiratory alkalosis.

\section*{General Management \& Treatment}
- Bed rest,
- drink copious Pluids,
- Breathe warm and moist air
- cough surpressants
- pair relievers
- Many cases of acute bronchitis may go aveay without any specific treatment, but there is no cure for chronic bronchitis.
- Antibiotics may be prescribed so as to prevent secondary infections
- Cough medications may be administered but we should not suppress the cough completely because its usually important to bring up mucus and remove irritants from the lungs.
- Bronchodilator and Mucolytics help open bronchial tubes, thin and clear out mucus.

BRONCHIOLITIS

\section*{Bronchiolitis}
- Is inflammation of the fine bronchioles and small bronchi.

\section*{Causes}
- Viruses, such as
- Adenoilirus,
- ParainPluenza uirus
- Respiratory syncytial oirus(RSV)

\section*{Clinical Peatures}
- Increased respiratory rate
- Mild Pever
- Leukocytosis
- Atelectasis
- Tachycardia
- Exhaustion

\section*{Management}
- Antipyretics
- Adequate hydration
- Hospitalization in severe distress
- Humidified oxygen
- Nebulized bronchodilators, epinephrine, and anti-inPlammatory medications
- Assisted ventilation
- Nutritional support

\section*{Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD)}

\section*{Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases}
-Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) repers to chronic bronchitis and emphysema, a pair of two commonly co- existing diseases of the lungs in which the airways become narrowed.
- This leads to a limitation of the Plouv of air to and from the lungs causing shortness of breath.

\section*{In COPD, less air flows in and out of the airveays because of one or more of the following:}
- The airways and air sacs lose their elastic quality.
- The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed.
- The wealls of the airways become thick and inflamed.
- The airways make more mucus than usual, which tends to clog them.
COPD Refers to both:
1. Chronic bronchitis (discussed earlier)
2. Emphysema

\section*{EMPHYSEMA}

Definition:-
- Emphysema is defined as enlargement with destruction of the walls of the alleeoli.
- As the alweoli are destroyed the alweolar surface area in contact with the capillaries decreases reducing gaseous exchange leading to hypoxia.

\section*{In later stages: C02 elimination is disturbed and increase in CO2 tension in arterial blood causing respiratory acidosis}

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
- Blood Test - Blood tests can help determine if symptoms are being caused by an infection.
- An arterial blood gas test weill measure the amount of oxygen in blood.
- Chest X-ray or CT scan
- Sputum Examination - especially if the client has a productive cough. Analyzing sputum can help identify the cause of breathing difficulties
- ECG - to determine if your shortness of breath is being caused by a heart condition.
- Pulmonary Function Test - measure houe well the lungs are moving air in and out. They also measure hour well the lungs are moving oxygen to the blood.

\section*{MEDICAL MANAGEMENT}

The treatment goal for the client with COPD are:
- To improve wentilation
$>$ To facilitate the removal of bronchial secretions
$>$ To promote health maintenance
$>$ To reduce compotications, and
- To sloue progression of the disease
- Smoking cessation - Cessation of cigarette smoking is single most effective and cost effective intervention to reduce the risk of developing COPD and stop the progression of the disease.
- Bronchodilator drug therapy dilate the air passages by relaxing the bronchial smooth muscle and improve the wentilation of lungs. They are usually administered wia inhalation route but in rare occasions may be given orally or administered intracenously.
- Oxygen therapy

\section*{Surgical management}
- Bullectomy - Bullae are enlarged airspaces that do not contribute to ventillation but occupy space in the thorax, these areas may be surgically excised
- Lung wolume reduction surgery - It incolves the removal of a portion of the diseased lung parenchyma.this allous the functional tissue to expand.
- Lung transptantation

\section*{Nursing management}

Nursing diagnosis - Impaired gas exchange related to decreased ventilation
Objectives - Improve ventilation

\section*{Intervention}
a. Monitor lung sounds every 4 to 8 hours.
b. Perform chest physiotherapy
c. Advice the client to drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of fluid per day unless contraindicated
d. Teach the client about coughing technique
e. Asses the condition of oral mucus membrane and perform oral care

Nursing diagnosis
Disturbed sleep pattern related to dyspnea Objectives
Getting adequate rest

\section*{Intervention}
- Promote relaxation by providing a darkened, quiet encironment, ensure adequate room wentilation.
- Schedule care activities to allow periods of uninterrupted sleep.

\section*{Nursing diagnosis - Anxiety related to acute breathing difficultives and fear of suppocation Objectives - Relieve Pear of dying}

Intervention
- Provide a quiet, calm environment.
- During acute episodes, open doors and curtains and limit the number of people in the room.
- Encourage the use of breathing relaxation technique
- Nonpharmacological methods of anxiety reduction are more useful

Nursing diagnosis - Ineffective airway clearance related to excessive secretions and ineffective
coughing
Objective - EPPective airuacy clearance
Intervention
- Monitor lung sounds every 4 to 8 hours.
- Perform chest physiotherapy
- Adrice the client to drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of Pluid per day unless contraindicated
- Jeach the client in coughing technique
- Asses the condition of oral mucus membrane and perform oral care

\section*{Complications}
- More Prequent lung infections, such as pneumonia.
- Heart Pailure affecting the right side of the heart
- A collapsed lung (pneumothorax).
- Sleep problems.

BRONCHIECTASIS

Derbucton: Bronchlectasis is a cnronc, urreversbote dilation of the bronchi and bronchioles.
Involves Irrewersible bronchial dilatation
auses
dirueay obstruction
Diffuse airueay injury
Pulmonary infections and obstruction of the ronchus
Genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis
Abnormal host delense (eg immunodeficiency)
Idiopathic causes

\section*{Clinical Peatures}
- Chronic cough with mucopurulent sputum
- Wheezing or stridor.
- Cyanosis
- Easy Patigability
- Retarded physical grouth
- Chest enlargement from over-inflation of alveoli caused by the air trapped behind inflamed bronchi.
- Clubbing of the fingers also is common because of respiratory insulficiency

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- The inflammatory process associated with pulmonary infections damages the bronchial wall, causing a loss of its supporting structure and resulting in thick sputum that ultimately obstructs the bronchi. The walls become permanently distended and distorted, impairing mucociliary clearance.
- The inflammation and infection may extend to the peribronchial tissues; each dilated tube oirtually amounting to a lung abscess. The exudate of which drains Preely through the bronchus.
- Bronchiectasis is usually localized, affecting a segment or lobe of a lung, most frequently the lower lobes.
- The retention of secretions and subsequent obstruction ultimately cause the alweoli distal to the obstruction to collapse (atelectasis).
- Inflammatory scarring or fibrosis replaces functioning lung tissue. In time the patient develops respiratory insulficiency with reduced wital capacity and decreased wentilation leading to hypoxemia.

\section*{Investigations}
- Full blood count
- Sputum exam
- Ct scan

\section*{General Management}
- Early and effective management reduces shortand long-term morbidity
- Airueay clearance - Example: By chest physio.
- Nutrition
- Avoid eneironmental pollutants e.g Jobacco
- Assessment for co-morbidities (other respiratory disorders)
- Intensive antibiotic treatments to Reduce microbial load
- Inhaled mucolytic agents or bronchodilators
- Chest physiotherapy-to raise the tenacious sputum.
- Treat the cause
- Smoking cessation is important because smoking impairs bronchial drainage by paralyzing ciliary action, increasing bronchial secretions, and causing inflammation of the mucous membranes

\section*{Nursing Management}
- Nursing management of the patient weith bronchiectasis focuses on alleneiating symptoms and assisting the patient to clear pulmonary secretions.
- Smoking and other factors that increase the production of mucus and hamper its remoeal are targeted in patient teaching.
- The patient and Pamily are taught to perform postural drainage and to acoid exposure to others weith upper respiratory and other infections.
- If the patient experiences Patigue and dyspnea, strategies to conserve energy while maintaining a lifestyle as active as possible are discussed.
- The patient needs to become knouledgeable about early signs of respiratory infection and the progression of the disorder so that appropriate treatment can be implemented promptly.
- The patient's nutritional status is assessed and strategies are implemented to ensure an adequate diet.

\section*{BRONCHIAL ASTHMA}

\section*{Introduction}

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airveays that is characterized:
- clinically by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and cough, particularly at night/early morning.
- physiologically by widespread, reversible narrowing of the bronchial airways and a marked increase in bronchial responsiveness.

\section*{Classilication}

Atopic /extrinsic /allergic asthma(~70\%)
- IgE mediated immune responses to environmental antigens.

\section*{Non-atopic/intrinsic/non-allergic asthma(~30\%)}
- Triggered by non immune stimuli.
- Patients have negative skin test to common inhalant allergens and normal serum concentrations of Ig $\varepsilon$.
- Asthma may be triggered by aspirin, pulmonary infections, cold, exercise, psychological stress or inhaled irritants.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

OBSTRUCTIVE AIRWAY DISEASES

\section*{ACUTE AND CHRONIC BRONCHITIS}
- Bronchitis is the inflammation of the bronchi. It is an obstructive respiratory disease that may occur in both acute and chronic forms.
- Acute bronchitis is commonly a bacterial infection, which responds well to broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- Chronic heavy smoking and air pollution contribute to chronic bronchitis.
- The inflammation of the bronchi brings about thickening and an increase in mucous secretions, oedema, decrease in ciliated cells and narrowing of the bronchi.

\section*{Acute bronchitis}
- Inflammation of the bronchial passages most commonly caused by infection with bacteria or viruses. It may follow a common cold.
- Streptococcus, staphylococcus aureus and H. influenza are commonly associated with acute bronchitis.
- Acute bronchitis is generally a self-limiting condition in healthy individuals but can have much more severe consequences in individuals who are weakened with other illness or who are immunocompromised.

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- During an episode of acute bronchitis, the cells of the bronchial-lining tissue are irritated and the mucous membrane becomes hyperemic and edematous, diminishing bronchial mucociliary function.
- Consequently, the air passages become clogged by debris and irritation increases.
- In response, copious secretion of mucus develops, which causes the characteristic cough of bronchitis.
- Acute bronchitis usually lasts approximately 10 days. If the inflammation extends downward to the ends of the bronchial tree, into the small bronchi (bronchioles), and then into the air sacs, bronchopneumonia results.

\section*{Symptoms of acute bronchitis}
- Productive cough,
- Dyspnoea
- Possible fever.

\section*{Chronic bronchitis}
- Is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that is most frequently associated with cigarette smoking.
- Chronic bronchitis may also be caused by prolonged exposure to inhaled particulates such as coal dust or other pollutants.'

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- Chronic bronchitis is associated with excessive tracheobronchial mucus production sufficient to cause cough with expectoration for 3 or more months a year for at least 2 consecutive years.
- This mucus accumulation can impair function of the ciliated epithelium and lining of the respiratory tract and prevent the clearing of debris and organisms.
- The alveolar epithelium is both the target and the initiator inflammation in chronic bronchitis.
- A predominance of neutrophils and the peribronchial distribution of fibrotic changes result from the action of interleukin 8, colony-stimulating factors, and other chemotactic and proinflammatory cytokines.
- Airway epithelial cells release these inflammatory mediators in response to toxic, infectious, and inflammatory stimuli, in addition to decreased release of regulatory products such as angiotensinconverting enzyme or neutral endopeptidase.
- As a result, patients with chronic bronchitis often suffer repeated bouts of acute respiratory infection.

\section*{Manifestations of chronic bronchitis:}
- Productive, chronic cough
- Production of purulent sputum
- Frequent acute respiratory infections
- Dyspnea
- Hypoxia, cyanosis
- Symptoms of cor pulmonale
- Fluid accumulation (edema) in later stages

\section*{Treatment of chronic bronchitis:}
- Cessation of smoking or exposure to irritants
- Bronchodilators to open airway passages
- Expectorants to loosen mucus
- Anti - inflammatory to relieve airway inflammation and reduce mucus secretion
- Prophylactic antibiotics for respiratory infections
- Oxygen therapy
- Patient education goes hand in hand with the antibiotics, especially on the importance of completing the dose and recognition of symptoms of complications such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

BRONCHIAL ASTHMA

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
- It is an intermittent, reversible, obstructive airway disease that is characterized by increased responsiveness of the trachea and bronchi to stimuli resulting in the narrowing of the airway.
- Asthma is a condition characterized by reversible bronchospasm and chronic inflammation of airway passages.
- A key component of asthma appears to be airway "hyperactivity" in affected individuals. Exposure to certain "triggers" can induce marked bronchospasm and airway inflammation in susceptible patients

\section*{Clinical \\ \section*{Classification} \\ \section*{of}}

\section*{Asthma}
- Mild intermittent : Attacks occur 2 times per week or less
- Mild persistent : Attacks occur more than 2 times per week
- Moderate persistent : Attacks occur daily or almost daily and are severe enough to affect activity
- Severe persistent : Attacks are very frequent and persist for a long period of time; attacks severely limit activity

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- Exposure of the person to a stimulant causes the initiation of an immunological response which leads to production of antibodies against the allergen and antigen.
- Individuals with asthma appear to produce large amounts of the antibody IgE that attach to the mast cells present in many tissues.
- Re-exposure to a trigger e.g. pollen results into the antigen binding into the antibodies resulting into the production of cell mediators which include histamine, and prostaglandins.
- These mediators cause the muscles of the airway to go into spasms, mucus membrane swelling and hyper production of mucus secretion.
- This leads to bronchoconstriction with increased secretion causing further obstruction of the airway.
- Breathing in becomes easier with more effort required in expiration due to narrowing of the bronchus and increased secretion.
- The secretion produces a sound as air squeezes out of the constricted bronchus. This sound is called a wheeze.

\section*{Early phase of asthma:}

The early phase of asthma is characterized by:
a. marked constriction of bronchial airways (bronchospasm)
b. edema of the airways
c. production of excess mucus.
- The bronchospasm that occurs may be the result of the increased release of certain inflammatory mediators such as histamine, prostaglandins and bradykinin that, in the early stages of asthmatic response, promote bronchoconstriction rather than inflammation.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_14_a821d5d271140bc71f69g-018.jpg?height=1515&width=1162&top_left_y=272&top_left_x=2047)

\section*{Late phase of asthma:}
* The late phase of asthma can occur several hours after the initial onset of symptoms and manifests mainly as an inflammatory response.
* The primary mediators of inflammation during the asthmatic response are the white blood cells Eosinophils that stimulate mast cell degranulation and release substances that attract other white cells to the area.
× Subsequent infiltration of the airway tissues with white blood cells such as Neutrophils and lymphocytes also contributes to the overall inflammatory response of the late phase of asthma.

\section*{Types}
- Extrinsic asthma
- Patients usually have a history of earlier allergic conditions like eczema or allergic rhinitis.
- They usually have known allergies like pollens, animals and food. Children with this type of asthma recover with age especially in adolescence.
- Intrinsic
- This is not related to any allergen.
- The attacks become more severe and frequent with time and can progress into chronic bronchitis or emphysema.
- Factors associated with intrinsic asthma include environmental pollutants, cold weather, exercise, respiratory tract infection or drugs especially the non steroidal like aspirin.
- Mixed
- This is the most common and has both the characteristics of the intrinsic and extrinsic type.

\section*{Some Potential Asthma Triggers}
- Allergens - Pollen, pet dander, fungi, dust mites
- Cold air
- Pollutants
- Cigarette smoke
- Strong emotions
- Exercise
- Respiratory tract infections

\section*{Why asthma makes it hard to breathe}

Air enters the respiratory system from the nose and mouth and travels through the bronchial tubes.

In an asthmatic person, the muscles of the bronchial tubes tighten and thicken, and the air passages become inflamed and mucusfilled, making it difficult for air to move.

Inflamed bronchial tube of an asthmatic

In a non-asthmatic person, the muscles around the bronchial tubes are relaxed and the tissue thin, allowing for easy airflow.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_14_a821d5d271140bc71f69g-023.jpg?height=907&width=1345&top_left_y=480&top_left_x=663)

Normal bronchial tube
- Clinical Features
- Cough is present due to production of excessive mucus secretion
- Slow laboured breathing with excessive use of accessory muscles
- Obstructed airway creates dyspnoea
- Profuse sweating, weak pulse and cold extremities is experienced due to fluid loss and dehydration
- Occasionally nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea
- Air hunger and chest tightness
- Wheezing
- Increased respiratory rate (tachypnoea)
- Significant anxiety

\section*{Diagnosis}
- History of hypersensitivity to known allergen or stimulant
- Clinical manifestation
- Pulmonary function test, BGAs
- Chest x-ray

\section*{Management of Asthma}
- When the patient has ineffective breathing due to bronchospasms, mucosal oedema and increased secretions:
- Provide a comfortable sitting up position to facilitate breathing and use of accessory muscles.
- Give low humidified oxygen to increase oxygen saturation and correct hypoxia.
- Monitor the vital signs and respiratory activity of the patient to identify any change of condition and acute dyspnoea.
- Monitor blood gases with pulse oximetry or blood gases analysis to monitor oxygen saturation.
- Auscultate patient's chest, premedicate with bronchodilator, advise deep breathing, coughing and chest physiotherapy to open airway and to allow good sputum removal.
- Teach patient deep breathing to increase PaO2 and reduce the respiratory rate.
- Administer bronchodilator Beta 2 agonist to reduce bronchospasms.
- Inhaled, nebulized and/or subcutaneous
- Albuterol, terbutaline

\section*{Cont'}
- When the patient has ineffective airway clearance related to bronchospasms, ineffective cough and increased mucus production:
- Ensure absence of possible allergen to reduce the severity of attack.
- Assess patient's ability to expectorate secretions noting the character, quantity and odour of the secretions to rule out any infection.
- Carry out culture and sensitivity tests and treat with appropriate antibiotics.
- When the patient becomes anxious due to difficulty in breathing:
- Give simple, concise explanations to situations and procedures to alleviate anxiety.
- Provide reassurance by staying with the patient and allowing full participation.
- When there is risk of infection due to impaired airway clearance:
- Assess for infection, do culture and sensitivity tests and give the appropriate antibiotics
- When the patient has a knowledge deficit on the management of asthma:
- Teach patient and relatives about the important aspects of management.
- Enlighten patient on what asthma is, good asthma control, management and medication and their safe use.
- Xanthine drugs (example: theophylline) :
- Cause bronchodilation and also inhibit the late phase of asthma.
- Cromolyn sodium
- Anti-inflammatory agent that blocks both the early and late phase of asthma. The mechanism of action is unclear but may involve mast cell function or responsiveness to allergens.
- Anti-inflammatory drugs (corticosteroids) :
- Used orally or by inhalation to blunt the inflammatory response of asthma.
- Leukotrienes modifiers (example: Zafirlukast) :
- New class of agents that blocks the synthesis of the key inflammatory mediators, leukotrienes.

\section*{Complications of asthma}
- Severe acute Asthma (status asthmatics), which is a lifethreatening condition of prolonged bronchospasm that is often not responsive to drug therapy.
- Pneumothorax : is also a possible consequence as a result of lung pressure increases that can result from the extreme difficulty involved in expiration during a prolonged asthma attack.
- Respiratory failure: marked hypoxemia and acidosis might occur.

STATUS ASTHMATICUS

\section*{Introduction}
- Status asthmaticus is severe bronchial asthma that is unresponsive to conventional therapy and lasts for more than 24 hours.

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- There is narrowing of bronchus, with bronchospasms and swelling.
- Increased mucus production limits air movement and patient ends up with hypoxaemia.
- Patient presents with respiratory alkalosis initially and as condition persists progresses to acidosis.

\section*{Causes include}
- Infection that is not resolved
- Anxiety
- Dehydration
- Increased beta block
- Non specific irritant
- Use of aspirin

\section*{Clinical Features}
- Marked respiratory distress
- Cyanosis
- Marked wheezing
- Absence of breath sounds

\section*{Management}
- Patient is admitted, preferably in a pulmonary ICU.
- Intravenous fluids are given to replace lost fluids.
- Nebulisation can be attempted if not initially used to cause bronchodilation.
- Low humidified oxygen is used where dyspnoea is marked. With poor ventilation, treat with endotrachial intubation and mechanical ventilation.
- Intravenous drip of aminophylline is commenced with corticosteroid to restore bronchial reactivity.
- Mucolytic may also be used to help in the removal of secretions.
- Antibiotics are used for treatment of underlying respiratory infection or prophylactically.
- Carry out constant monitoring of the vital signs to identify deviations from normal and also to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy.

\section*{EMPHYSEMA}
- Pulmonary emphysema is an irreversible distention of the bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveoli.
- This results in increased capacity of the lungs.
- In this condition, the alveoli may merge, hence decreasing the surface area.

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- Emphysema is a pathologic diagnosis defined by permanent enlargement of airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles.
- This leads to a dramatic decline in the alveolar surface area available for gas exchange.
- Furthermore, loss of alveoli leads to airflow limitation by 2 mechanisms.
- First, loss of the alveolar walls results in a decrease in elastic recoil, which leads to airflow limitation.
- Second, loss of the alveolar supporting structure leads to airway narrowing, which further limits airflow.

\section*{Morphological patterns of Emphysema}
- Emphysema has 3 morphologic patterns:
- Centriacinar
- Panacinar
- Distal acinar, or paraseptal
- Centriacinar emphysema is characterized by focal destruction limited to the respiratory bronchioles and the central portions of the acini. This form of emphysema is associated with cigarette smoking and is typically most severe in the upper lobes.
- Panacinar emphysema involves the entire alveolus distal to the terminal bronchiole.
- The panacinar type is typically most severe in the lower lung zones and generally develops in patients with homozygous alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency.
- Distal acinar emphysema, or paraseptal emphysema, is the least common form and involves distal airway structures, alveolar ducts, and sacs.
- Predisposing factors: Smoking, acute inflammation, chronic cough and congenital defects that result in deficiency of proteolytic enzyme in the lungs.
- Emphysema may also result from rupture of the lung through stab wounds and accidents.
- Emphysema can be divided into alveolar or interstitial emphysema.

\section*{Management}
- Treatment of respiratory tract infection if present
- Bronchodilators such as anticholinergics, beta-2-adrenergic blockers and corticosteroids
- Chest physiotherapy to improve the removal of secretions
- Positive end expiratory respiration if the patient is on assisted ventilation, this prevents alveolar collapse
- Breathing exercises and retraining
- Hydration with at least three litres of fluid per day
- Advice on cessation of smoking
- Rest as appropriate
- Progressive plan of exercises and pulmonary rehabilitation

\section*{Complications}
- Pneumonia - this is an infection of the alveoli and bronchioles.
- Collapsed lung - some lungs develop large air pockets (bullae), which may burst, resulting in lung deflation (also called pneumothorax)
- Holes in lungs (giant bullae): these large holes make it difficult for your lung to expand. They can also get infected and may lead to a collapsed lung.
- Collapsed lung: this is a life-threatening condition for people with emphysema because their lungs are already damaged.
- Heart problems: emphysema often increases pressure in the arteries connecting your lungs to your heart.

\section*{BRONCHIECTASIS}
- It is a condition that results from prolonged injury or inflammation of respiratory airways and bronchioles.
- It is characterized by abnormal dilation of the bronchus or bronchi. It is most frequently associated with chronic respiratory disease, infections, cystic fibrosis, tumor growth or exposure to respiratory toxins.

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- Its pathophysiology is commonly described as distinct phases of infection and chronic inflammation.
- The first stage in the development of bronchiectasis is an initial infective insult to the airways, which triggers a mucociliary response.
- Micro-organisms trigger the release of toxins and an inflammatory response within the airways.
- This inflammatory response includes the release of neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages within the bronchial lumen.
- Neutrophils also alter the function of the cilial epithelium, leading to changes in cilial beat frequency and mucous gland hypersecretion.
- Both processes compromise mucociliary clearance.
- This loss of mucociliary transport renders the airways susceptible to microbial colonization. This encourages further release of inflammatory mediators, which facilitate neutrophil migration to the bronchial lumen and mucosa.
- These changes in airway structure further contribute to pooling of mucus, and the self-perpetuating cycle of infection and inflammation, which promotes progressive airway damage and recurrent infections

\section*{Signs and symptoms}
- There is persistent cough to remove mucous retained in the dilated areas, which increases the pressure, worsening the dilation.
- Pus may form or bleeding may occur.
- Impaired ventilation of the alveoli,
- Chronic inflammation and possible fibrosis of the areas.

\section*{Management}
- Pharmacotherapy: bronchodilators, mucolytic agents, expectorants and antibiotics.
- Good hydration, to liquefy secretions, must be maintained.
- Postural drainage and avoidance of air irritants are also important.

\section*{Complications}
- Pneomonia
- Hypoxia
- Right sided heart failure.
- Lung abscess
- Empyema
- Emphysema
- Cor pulmonale
- Septicaemia
- Recurrent pleurisy

\section*{Atelectasis}
- Atelectasis refers to the collapse of an alveoli, lobule or lung unit. This could be due to defective expansion of the lungs at birth as a result of obstruction, poorly developed lungs and poor stimulation in the respiratory centre. It may also be acquired as a result of severe lung infection, particularly where there is poor clearance of secretions.
- Bronchial carcinoma and bronchiectasis are also common causes. The patient may present with dyspnoea, cyanosis, prostration and chest pain. There is cyanosis and anxiety with dyspnoea.
- The affected side or part of chest has little movement with the opposite side experiencing excessive chest movement.

\section*{Management}
- Endoscopic procedures may be performed.
- Carry out a radiograph e.g chest x-ray.
- Angiograph - study of pulmonary vessels. The goal of management is to increase ventilation and remove the obstruction.
- Encourage the patient to cough and do suction where indicated. Chest physiotherapy will also assist in facilitating secretion drainage.
- Oxygen therapy will be done to increase oxygen concentration during inhalation.

\section*{Restrictive Pulmonary Disorders}

PNEUMONIA

\section*{Introduction}
- Pneumonia is an acute respiratory illness, which is either segmental or affecting more than one lobe.
- Pneumonia is a condition that involves inflammation of lower lung structures such as the alveoli or interstitial spaces.
- It can be community acquired, hospital acquired or occurring due to immunosuppression.
- It can also occur as a result of aspiration of contents.
- The factors that contribute to this process include damage to the epithelia lining by chronic disease, chronic bronchitis and aspiration of contents from the stomach when drunk or unconscious.
- In our setup, the common infectious agents include: streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus.
- In patients with an impaired immune system, the agent pneumocystis carinii commonly causes pneumonia in the immunocompromised.
- Most pneumonia occurs when a breakdown in your body's natural defenses allows germs to invade and multiply within your lungs.
- It occurs when viruses, bacteria, or fungi cause inflammation and infection in the alveoli (tiny air sacs) in the lungs
- To destroy the attacking organisms, white blood cells rapidly accumulate.
- Along with bacteria and fungi, they fill the air sacs within your lungs (alveoli).
- Bronchopneumonia is a type of pneumonia that causes inflammation in the alveoli hence trouble breathing because their airways are constricted.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_14_a821d5d271140bc71f69g-060.jpg?height=970&width=2229&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=408)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_14_a821d5d271140bc71f69g-060.jpg?height=843&width=2461&top_left_y=990&top_left_x=421)

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- Any infectious organisms that reach the alveoli are likely to be highly virulent, as they have already evaded the host's physical defense mechanisms.
- Consequently, they may overwhelm the macrophages, resulting in production of a fibrin-rich exudate that fills the infected and neighbouring alveolar spaces, causing them to stick together, rendering them airless.
- The inflammatory response also results in a proliferation of neutrophils.
- This can damage lung tissue, leading to fibrosis and pulmonary oedema, which also impairs lung expansion.
- The inflammatory response can also lead to the development of a pleural effusion which is thought to complicate up to $40 \%$ of cases of pneumonia.
- These changes result in reduced gaseous exchange. As a result, vital organs become oxygen deprived and the respiratory effort required with each breath will be increased as a result of the disturbance in normal physiology.

\section*{Individuals Most at Risk for Pneumonia}
- Elderly
- Those with viral infection
- Chronically ill
- AIDS or immunosuppressed patients
- Smokers
- Patients with chronic respiratory disease e.g. bronchial asthma.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Breathlessness
- Cough
- Fever
- Chest pain,
- Tachypnoea and reduced chest movements.
- Dyspnoea and fatigue
- On x-ray the film may show pulmonary infiltration
- Cough could be purulent, or yellow and blood stained, or red and gelatinous.

\section*{Diagnosis}
- Vital signs and breathing patterns are assessed.
- Sputum is collected for culture and sensitivity testing.
- Determine the colour, consistency and amount of sputum the patient is producing.

\section*{Classification of Pneumonia}
- Community vs hospital setting
- Typical vs atypical pathogens

\section*{Community vs Hospital setting}
- Community acquired pneumonia (CAP)
- Aspiration pneumonia
- Hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP)
- Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP)
- Healthcare associated pneumonia (HCAP)
- A second classification scheme for pneumonia is based on the specific structures of the lung that the organisms infect and includes typical and atypical pneumonia.
- Typical
- Streptococcus pneumoniae
- Hemophilus influenzae
- Mycobacterium catarrhalis
- Klebsiella pneumoniae
- Atypical
- Chlamydia pneumoniae
- Legionella pneumophila
- Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
- Viruses
- Fungi
- Less Common pathogens
- N. meningitidis
- Chlamydia psittaci
- B. anthracis
- Y. pestis

\section*{Typical pneumonia}
- Usually bacterial in origin.
- Organisms replicate in the spaces of the alveoli.

\section*{Manifestations:}
- Inflammation and fluid accumulation are seen in the alveoli.
- White cell infiltration and exudation can been seen on chest radiographs.
- High fever, chest pain, chills, and malaise are present.
- Purulent sputum is present.
- Some degree of hypoxemia is present.

\section*{Atypical pneumonia}
- Usually viral in origin.
- Organisms replicate in the spaces around the alveoli.

\section*{Manifestations:}
- Milder symptoms than typical pneumonia.
- Lack of white cell infiltration in alveoli.
- Lack of fluid accumulation in the alveoli.
- Not usually evident on radiographs.
- May make the patient susceptible to bacterial pneumonia.

\section*{Opportunistic organisms}
- A number of organisms not commonly associated with respiratory illness in otherwise healthy individuals can cause severe respiratory infections and pneumonia in patients with HIV or those who are immunocompromised as a result of immune suppressive therapy.
- These organisms include mycobacteria, fungus (Histoplasma) and protozoa (Pneumocystis carinii).
- Treatment of these organisms requires specific drug therapy, and, in the case of protozoa and fungi, the organisms are very difficult to kill.

\section*{Management}
- The goals of nursing care for a patient with pneumonia are:
- The patient to have clear breath sounds.
- Normal breathing pattern.
- Normal chest x-ray.
- No complications related to pneumonia.
- Interventions:
- To ensure comfort by proper positioning
- Good nutrition
- Fluids and electrolytes
- Patient education on infection prevention and control.
- When the patient has ineffective breathing pattern due to pneumonia and pain:
- Monitor respiratory function of a new patient's respiratory response to treatment, this should include blood gas analysis, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate and rhythm.
- Position patient in an upright position to ease breathing and facilitate use of accessory respiratory muscles.
- Give oxygen by mask or nasal cannular depending on the patients need
- When the patient has splenic pain:
- Administer analgesia and provide information that can relieve pain
- Observe the pharmacological effects of the drugs
- If the patient is at risk of infection, complications, administer antibiotics and observe their effects to therapy
- Monitor for any signs of hypoxemia
- Where there is an ineffective airway clearance due to thick secretions:
- Administer bronchodilators, mucolytics and exercises to facilitate secretions removal
- Maintain input of IV fluids to replace lost fluids and dilute the secretions (reduce the viscosity)
- When the patient is at the risk of altered health maintenance:
- Educate the patient on health, self care, and safe use of drugs to prevent recurrent infection
- Educate the patient on safe health practices and discourage unsafe practices like smoking
- Teach the patient about food and nutrition that will help maintain a healthy body
- To maintain body temperature:
- To relieve fever to promote comfort you can use antipyretics
- Provide fluid replacement for fever and dehydration
- If an activity intolerance exists due to dyspnoea on exertion:
- Administer oxygen and increase oxygen intake dependent on patients needs
- Plan for patient to prevent any unnecessary interruptions in order to decrease lung activity and promote ventilation
- Note signs to evaluate the condition and identify deviation from the normal
- Rehabilitation

\section*{Complications of pneumonia}
- Bacteremia and septic shock.
- Lung abscesses.
- Pleural effusions, empyema, and pleurisy.
- Renal failure.
- Respiratory failure.
- Lung Collapse
- Emphysema
- Empyema
- Hypoxemia

\section*{Pneumothorax}
- Pneumothorax is the entry of air into the pleural cavity in which the lungs reside.
- In order for normal lung expansion to occur, there must be a negative pressure within the pleural cavity with respect to atmospheric pressure outside the pleural cavity. The inside of the pleural cavity is essentially a vacuum and when air enters the pleural cavity the negative pressure is lost and the lungs collapse.
- Because each lung sits in a separate pleural cavity, pneumothorax of one plural cavity will not cause collapse of the other lung.

\section*{Types of pneumothorax:}
1.Open or communicating pneumothorax
- Usually involves a traumatic chest wound.
- Air enters the pleural cavity from the atmosphere.

- The lung collapses due to equilibration of pressure within the pleural cavity with atmospheric pressure.
2. Closed or spontaneous pneumothorax
- Occurs when air "leaks" from the lungs into the pleural cavity.
- May be caused by lung cancer, rupture, pulmonary disease.
- The increased plural pressure prevents lung expansion during inspiration and the lung remains collapsed.
3. Tension pneumothorax
- A condition in which there is a oneway movement of air into but not out of the pleural cavity.
- May involve a hole or wound to the pleural cavity that allows air to enter and the lung to collapse.
- Upon expiration, the hole or opening closes, which prevents the movement of air back out of the pleural cavity.

- A life-threatening condition because pressure in the pleural cavity continues to increase and may result in further lung compression or compression of large blood vessels in the thorax or the heart.
- Manifestations of pneumothorax:
- Tachypnea,
- Dyspnea
- Chest pain
- Possible compression of thoracic blood vessels and heart, especially with tension pneumothorax

\section*{Treatment of pneumothorax:}
- Removal of air from the pleural cavity with a needle or chest tube
- Repair of trauma and closure of opening into pleural cavity

TUBERCULOSIS

\section*{Introduction}
- Tuberculosis is caused by the bacteria mycobacterium tuberculosis, also referred to as acid-fast bacilli.
- These bacteria are spread either by droplet infection or dust contaminated by sputum.
- Tuberculosis is divided into primary TB and secondary TB.
- Primary TB is infection to the lungs as a result of mycobacterium tuberculosis.
- When microbes colonise the lung, macrophages surround the microbes, triggering the body's defense mechanisms.
- These macrophages spread to other areas and primary complexes are formed at the Hillary lymph nodes.
- Caseous material forms in several areas including the lungs.
- Caseous material is basically necrotic (dead) tissue. The disease may then be referred to as pulmonary tuberculosis.
- It is called extra pulmonary tuberculosis if it affects areas outside the respiratory system.

\section*{Clinical features of pulmonary TB}
- Persistent cough for more than four weeks,
- Unexplained weight loss,
- Chest pain,
- Night sweats,
- Poor appetite
- Haemoptysis.

\section*{SYMPTOMS OF TUBERCULOSIS}

Headache
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_14_a821d5d271140bc71f69g-090.jpg?height=1396&width=2973&top_left_y=352&top_left_x=155)
- When the disease is extra pulmonary, the manifestations may include:
- Enlarged lymph nodes,
- Pain and swelling in the joints,
- Meningitis
- Paralysis if the spine is involved.
- Secondary TB is infection that is due to the caseous material in other organs such as the spinal cord, bone and brain.

\section*{Management of Tuberculosis}
- TB is treated with standard pharmacologic agents. While nursing a patient with tuberculosis, the overall nursing goals are that the patient will:
- Comply with the therapeutic regimen
- Have no recurrence of the disease
- Have normal pulmonary function
- Take appropriate measures to prevent the spread of the disease

\section*{Complications of Pulmonary Tuberculosis}
1. Hemoptysis
2. Pleurisy
3. Pleural effusion
4. Empyema
5. Pneumothorax
6. Aspergilloma
7. Endobronchitis
8. Brochiectasis
9. Laryngitis
10. Cor pulmonale
11. Ca bronchus
12. Enteritus
13. Miliary Tuberculosis
14. HIV related opportunistic infections

PLEURAL DISEASE

\section*{Introduction}
- The pleura can be inflamed after injury or as a result of introduction of microbes from other processes. Accumulation of air within the pleural cavity results in pneumothorax. Tension pneumothorax is due to stab injury that allows air to enter, but not leave, the pleural space.

\section*{Manifestations}
- Pleural pain,
- Dyspnoea,
- Chest asymmetry and
- hypoxia are common

\section*{Pleural Effusion}
- Pleural effusion refers to accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity. The fluid may be blood, serous exudates or pus. It can be a complication of diseases such as pulmonary tuberculosis or lung cancer. It can also follow increased pressure due to heart failure, and increased permeability due to inflammation and impaired drainage. The manifestations are almost the same as pneumothorax. However, the percussion note on examination is different (dull).
- The note elicited when percussing air filled cavities sounds like a drum.
- Generally, a detailed history and physical assessment must be undertaken to come up with nursing diagnoses.
- Other than the medication, teaching on how to avoid spreading the disease, continued follow-up and compliance with the drug regimen and good nutrition must be given.
- The involvement of the chest and pleura can be very distressing. It is important to institute measures to ensure that respiratory function is not compromised.
- For pleural fluid to accumulate in disease, there must be increased production from increased hydrostatic pressure, decreased oncotic or pleural pressure, increased microvascular permeability, or peritoneal-pleural movement.

\section*{Management of Pleural Disease and Chest Trauma}
- The emergency management of chest injuries involves:
- Establishing and maintaining an airway
- Administering high flow oxygen
- Establishing IV access
- Monitoring vital signs, level of consciousness and urinary output
- Assessing for tension pneumothorax
- Dressing a sucking chest wound with nonporous material
- Putting the patient in semi-Fowler's position or laying them on the injured side if breathing is easier
- A pneumothorax can be aspirated if there is minimal air or fluid in the pleural space
- Chest tubes and under water seal drainage are the most definitive treatment modalities
- The nursing care for a patient on underwater seal drainage includes the following actions:
- Avoid kinks in the tubing
- Keep all connections tight
- Keep the water seal and suction chambers at appropriate levels by adding sterile water as needed
- Mark the drainage levels appropriately
- Follow principles of asepsis when emptying the fluid and when changing the bottle
- Observe for air bubbles in the water seal chamber and fluctuations in the chest tubes
- Air should be bubbling from the chest tube. Check for intermittent bubbling in the water seal
- Monitor the patient's status and avoid elevating the drainage system to the level of the patient's chest or above
- Encourage the patient to cough
- lung scarring,
- pneumothorax (collapse of the lung) as a complication of thoracentesis,
- empyema (a collection of pus within the pleural space), and.
- sepsis (blood infection) sometimes leading to death.

\section*{Introduction}
- The major function of the lungs is respiratory exchange. Inhaled air and potentially dangerous substances are conducted to the alveoli through a network of bronchi and bronchioles.
- The putative stem cells of the bronchus are basal cells, which are believed to give rise to the differentiation of ciliated, mucous and neuroendocrine cells.
- Lung cancer may arise from all these differentiated and undifferentiated cells, from either the central (small cell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinoma) or the peripheral (adenocarcinoma) airway compartment.
- The interaction between inhaled carcinogens and the epithelium of upper and lower airways leads to the formation of DNA adducts: pieces of DNA covalently bound to a cancercausing chemical.
- If DNA adducts persist or are misrepaired, they result in a mutation and can cause genomic alterations.
- These are key events in lung cancer pathogenesis, especially if they occur in critical oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes.
- Lung cancer pathogenesis is also affected by a genetic component: it relates to the host susceptibility to lung cancer, with or without exposure to carcinogens.

\section*{Risk factors for lung cancer:}
- Smoking
- Exposure to secondhand smoke
- Exposure to radon gas
- Exposure to asbestos and other carcinogens
- Family history of lung cancer

\section*{Signs and Symptoms}
- A new cough that doesn't go away
- Coughing up blood, even a small amount
- Shortness of breath
- Chest pain
- Hoarseness
- Losing weight without trying
- Bone pain
- Headache

\section*{Management}
- Lung cancer is mainly treated by surgery and radiation therapy.
- Make sure that the patient has effective breathing patterns, adequate airway clearance, adequate oxygenation, minimal pain (or none at all), and adherence to treatment regimen.
- If one has undergone surgery, postural drainage, airway clearance and an effective breathing pattern are the goals of care.

\section*{Prevention}
- Don't smoke
- Stop smoking
- Avoid secondhand smoke
- Test your home for radon.
- Avoid carcinogens at work.
- Eat a diet full of fruits and vegetables.
- Exercise most days of the week

\section*{Complications}
- Shortness of breath
- Coughing up blood.
- Pain
- Fluid in the chest (pleural effusion).
- Cancer that spreads to other parts of the body (metastasis).
- Neuropathy
- Pain
- Pleural effusion
- Heart complications: pericardiocentesis and creating a pericardial window
- Blocked airways

\section*{ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY}
- Composed of upper and lower respiratory system
- Together the two are responsible for ventilation
- External respiration is responsible for exchange of gases between blood and the lungs
- Internal respiration involves exchange of gases between cells and blood

\section*{- UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT}

\section*{- FUNCTIONS}
- Protect respiratory system from infection and from foreign body inhalation through sneezing, coughing and spasm
- Warms and filters inspired air so that lower respiratory tract accomplishes gas exchange
- Humidification of air
- Passage way of air into the lower respiratory system

\section*{STRUCTURES OF THE UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT}
- Nose
${ }^{\text {- }}$ Sinuses- four bony cavities of the face and cranium containing air. They drain into the nose
- They serve as resonating chamber for speech and lighten the skull.
- They include; maxillary, ethmoid, frontal and sphenoid
- pharynx; Tube like structure that connect oral and nasal cavities to the larynx. functions as a passage way for respiratory and digestive system.
${ }^{-}$It is divided into ;
- Nasopharnyx which consist of adenoids on posterior wall and lymphoid tissue.
- Oropharynx; lie behind the mouth, consist of palatine tonsil between each pair of folds
- Laryngopharynx- extends from oropharynx and continues as oesophagus

\section*{LARYNX}

Links laryngopharynx and the trachea

\section*{functions}

Voice production
Protection of lower respiratory tract
Passage and humidification of air
- TRACHEA(Windpipe)

Passage between larynx and bronchi.
Contain c shaped of rings of cartilage at intervals which keep the tube open throughout. lined with ciliated mucosa

\section*{Functions}

Support and patency- arrangement of cartilages prevents obstruction and kinking of airway as head and neck moves.
Mucociliary escalator
Cough reflex
Warming, humidfying and filtering

\section*{LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT}
- LUNGS-
- Elastic structures found on each side of midthoracic cavity.
${ }^{-}$They are lined with pleura which consists of serous membrane with small amount of fluid that aid in lubrication.
- Visceral pleura is adherent/covers the lung and parietal pleura is adherent /lines the thorax.
${ }^{-}$Pleural cavity is the only potential space and contains no air and is separated by serous fluid that prevent friction during breathing
- INTERIOR OF THE LUNGSThe
${ }^{-}$lungs are composed of the bronchi and smaller air passages, alveoli, connective tissue, blood vessels, lymph vessels and nerves.

\section*{ALVEOLI}
- These distal respiratory passages are supported by a loose network of elastic connective tissue in which macrophages, fibroblasts, nerves and blood and lymph vessels are embedded. The alveoli are surrounded by a network of capillaries. The exchange of gases during respiration takes place across two membranes, the alveolar and capillary membranes.consist of three types of cells, epithelial, macrophage, and surfactant.

\section*{BRONCHI AND BRONCHIOLES}
${ }^{-}$The two primary bronchi are formed when the trachea divides. The bronchi progressively subdivide into bronchioles, terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and finally, alveoli.
- functions
- Gaseous exchange
- Propel mucus and foreign substances away from the lung
- Allow passage of air in and out of the alveoli
- Support and patency

\section*{FUNCTIONS OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM}
- Oxygen Transport
- Oxygen is supplied to, and carbon dioxide is removed from, cells by way of the circulating blood. Oxygen diffuses from the capillary through the capillary wall to the interstitial fluid. The movement of carbon dioxide occurs by diffusion from cell to blood.
${ }^{-}$Respiration
- This whole process of gas exchange between the atmospheric air and the blood and between the blood and cells of the body
${ }^{-}$ventilation
- Movement of air in and out of the airways

\section*{Muscles of respiration}
- The expansion of the chest during inspiration occurs as a result of muscular activity, partly voluntary and partly involuntary. The main muscles of respiration in normal quiet breathing are the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm. During difficult or deep breathing they are assisted by the muscles of the neck, shoulders and abdomen

\section*{PHYSIOLOGY OF RESPIRATION}
- INSPIRATION
- capacity of the thoracic cavity is increased by simultaneous contraction of the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm. This reduces the pressure in the pleural cavity to a level considerably lower than atmospheric pressure. This stretches the lungs and the pressure within the alveoli and in the air passages falls, drawing air into the lungs in an attempt to equalize the atmospheric and alveolar air pressures. The process of inspiration is active, as it requires expenditure of energy for muscle contraction.

\section*{Expiration}

Relaxation of the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm results in downward and inward movement of the rib cage and elastic recoil of the lungs. As this occurs, pressure inside the lungs exceeds that in the atmophere and therefore air is expelled from the respiratory tract.. This process is passive as it does not require the expenditure of energy. After expiration, there is a pause before the next cycle begins.

\section*{MECHANISM OF GASEOUS EXCHANGE}
- Exchange of gases takes place between alveolar air and capillary blood by the process of diffussion.each gas moves in both direction through the alveolar capillary membrane by diffusion. pressure gradient of each gas causes outward diffusion of co2 from lung capillary blood to the alveoli and inward diffusion of o2 from alveolar air to capillary blood. this exchange lowers pco2 and raises po2.

\section*{Physiological variables affecting respiration}

Elasticity. Elasticity is the term used to describe the ability of the lung to return to its normal shape after each breath. Loss of elasticity of the connective tissue in the lungs necessitates forced expiration and increased effort on inspiration.
Compliance. This is a measure of the distensibility of the lungs, i.e. the effort required to inflate the alveoli. When compliance is low the effort needed to inflate the lungs is greater than normal, e.g. in some diseases where elasticity is reduced or when insufficient surfactant is present. It should be noted that compliance and elasticity are opposing forces.

\section*{CONTROL OF RESPIRATION}
- Normal is involuntary.
- Voluntary is excerted by activities such as speaking and singing
- RESPIRATORY CENTRE
- Situated in brain stem in medulla oblangata and pons
- CHEMORECEPTORS-
- _These are receptors that respond to changes in the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. They are located centrally and peripherally.

\section*{DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES}
- Assignment review notes on history and physical exam of the respiratory system
${ }^{\bullet}$ Lung volumes and capacities
- PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS
- are routinely used in patients with chronic respiratory disorders. They are performed to assess respiratory function and to determine the extent of dysfunction. Such tests include measurements of lung volumes, ventilatory
- function, and the mechanics of breathing, diffusion, and gas exchange PFTs are useful in a patient with an established respiratory disease and assessing the response to therapy.
${ }^{\text {- }}$ They are useful as screening tests in potentially hazardous industries, such as coal mining .
- They are useful for screening patients scheduled for thoracic and upper abdominal surgery

\section*{ARTERIAL BLOOD GASES}
- Measurements of blood pH and of arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions. The arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) indicates the degree of oxygenation of the blood, and the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) indicates the adequacy of alveolar ventilation. Arterial blood gas studies aid in assessing the ability of the lungs to provide adequate oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.
- the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb or excrete bicarbonate ions to maintain normal body pH . Serial blood gas analysis also is a sensitive indicator of whether the lung has been damaged after chest trauma. Arterial blood gas levels are obtained through an arterial puncture at the radial, brachial, or femoral artery or through an indwelling arterial catheter.

\section*{PULSE OXIMETRY}
- Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive method of continuously monitoring the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin A probe or sensor is attached to the fingertip, forehead, earlobe, or bridge of the nose.. Normal SpO2 values are $95 \%$ to $100 \%$. Values less than $85 \%$ indicate that the tissues are not receiving enough oxygen, and the patient needs further evaluation.

\section*{SPUTUM STUDIES}
- Sputum is obtained for analysis to identify pathogenic organisms and to determine whether malignant cells are present. It also may be used to assess for hypersensitivity states
- In general, sputum cultures are used in diagnosis, for drug sensitivity testing, and to guide treatment
- CULTURES Throat cultures may be performed to identify organisms responsible for pharyngitis. Throat culture may also assist in identifying organisms responsible for infection of the lower respiratory tract

\section*{IMAGING STUDIES}
- This include x-rays,CT, MRI, Contrast studies, pulmonary angiography and fluoroscopic
- ENDOSCOPY PROCEDURES
- Bronchoscopy is the direct inspection and examination of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi
- Thoracoscopy
- Thoracoscopy is a diagnostic procedure in which the pleural
- cavity is examined with an endoscope. is primarily indicated in the diagnostic evaluation of pleural effusions, pleural disease, and tumor staging.
- THORACENTESIS -aspiration of pleural fluid for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes).
- BIOPSY - the excision of a small amount of tissue, may be per- formed to permit examination of cells from the pharynx, larynx, and nasal passages.

MAJOR SYMPTOMS OF THE RESPIRATORY DISEASE
- DYSPNEA
- difficult or labored breathing, shortness of breath.
- is a symptom common to many pulmonary and cardiac disorders, particularly when there is decreased lung compliance or increased airway resistance.
- It may also be associated with neurologic or neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, or muscular dystrophysignifies, asthma .

\section*{. Clinical Significance}
- In acute diseases of the lungs produce a more severe grade of dyspnea than do chronic diseases.
- Sudden dyspnea in a healthy person may indicate pneumothorax, acute respiratory obstruction, or ARDS. In immobilized patients, sudden dyspnea may denote pulmonary embolism.
- Orthopnea may be found in patients with heart disease and occasionally in patients with (COPD);
- dyspnea with an expiratory wheeze occurs with COPD.
- Noisy breathing may result from a narrowing of the air.

\section*{COUGH}
- Results from irritation of the mucous membranes anywhere in the respiratory tract. by smoke, smog, dust, or a gas. The cough is the patient's chief protection against the accumulation of secretions in the bronchi and bronchioles.

\section*{©linical Significance.}
${ }^{\circ}$ Cough may indicate serious pulmonary disease.
- It may be described as dry, hacking, wheezing or severe.
- A dry, irritative cough is characteristic of an upper respiratory tract infection of viral origin . Laryngotracheitis causes an irritative, highpitched cough. A severe or changing cough may indicate bronchogenic carcinoma
- Pleuritic chest pain accompanying coughing may indicate pleural or chest involvement.
${ }^{\circ}$ Cough in the morning with sputum indicate bronchitis
${ }^{\text {e }}$ Cough after food may indicate aspiration in the tracheal bronchial tree

\section*{SPUTUM PRODUCTION}
- Sputum production is the reaction of the lungs to any constantly recurring irritant. It also may be associated with a nasal discharge.

\section*{${ }^{-}$Clinical Significance}
- A profuse amount of purulent sputum or a change in color of the sputum probably indicates a bacterial infection.
${ }^{-}$Thin, mucoid sputum frequently results from viral bronchitis. A gradual increase of sputum over time may indicate the presence of chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis.
- Pink-tinged mucoid sputum suggest lung tumor
${ }^{\bullet}$ Foul smelling sputum indicate indicate lung abcess, bronchiectasis

\section*{CHEST PAIN}
${ }^{\text {emay be associated with pulmonary or cardiac disease. }}$
Chest pain associated with pulmonary conditions may be sharp, stabbing, and intermittent, or it may be dull, aching, and persistent. The pain usually is felt on the side where the pathologic process is located, but it may be referred elsewhere-for example, to the neck, back, or abdomen.

\section*{Clinical Significance.}
${ }^{\text {e }}$ Chest pain may occur with pneumonia, pulmonary embolism with lung infarction, and pleurisy.
${ }^{\text {-It }}$ also may be a late symptom of bronchogenic carcinoma.
${ }^{-}$Pleuritic pain is sharp and intensify on inspiration.
- WHEEZING - is often the major finding in a patient with bronchoconstriction or airway narrowing. It is a high- pitched, musical sound heard mainly on expiration.
${ }^{-}$Relief Measures. Oral or inhalant bronchodilator medications reverse wheezing in most instances.
${ }^{\bullet}$ CLUBBING OF THE FINGERS -is a sign of lung disease found in patients with chronic hypoxic conditions, chronic lung infections, and malignancies of the lung. manifested initially as loss of the nailbed angle

\section*{HEMOPTYSIS}
- expectoration of blood from the respiratory tract
- is a symptom of both pulmonary and cardiac disorders
The most common causes are:
Pulmonary infection
- Carcinoma of the lung
- Abnormalities of the heart or blood vessels
- Pulmonary artery or vein abnormalities
- Pulmonary emboli and infarction
- Chest trauma

\section*{CYANOSIS}
${ }^{\ominus}$,
- is a very late indicator of hypoxia.
- The presence or absence of cyanosis is determined by the amount of unoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood. appears when there is $5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ of unoxygenated hemoglobin.
- Anaemic patient rarely manifests cyanosis and a polycythemic patient may appear cyanotic even if adequately oxygenated. Therefore, cyanosis is not a reliable sign of hypoxia.
- central cyanosis is assessed by observing the color of the tongue and lips.
- Peripheral cyanosis results from decreased blood flow to a certain area of the body,.

\section*{INFEECTIONS OF THE LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT}
- BRONCHITIS
- It is the inflamation of the mucous membrane of the bronchi.
- Acute bronchitis-, an acute inflammation of the mucous membranes of the trachea and the bronchial tree, often follows infection of the upper respiratory tract.
- It is characterized by development of a cough without sputum production.
- Chronic bronchitis is defined clinically when an individual has had a cough with sputum(productive cough) for 3 months in 2 successive years. It is a progressive inflammatory disease resulting from prolonged irritation of the bronchial epithelium:

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}
- In acute tracheobronchitis, the inflamed mucosa of the bronchi produces mucopurulent sputum, often in response to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
- In chronic bronchitis results from repeated irritation of the airway leading to hyperscretion of the mucus and inflammation .There is hypertrophy of the mucus producing gland. mucocilliary clearance is delayed due to decrease in number of ciliated cells, hence productive cough. bronchial lumen is narrowed and fibrosis of

\section*{Predisposing factors}

\section*{${ }^{-}$Acute bronchitis}
- inhalation of physical and chemical irritants, gases, and other air contaminants.
- Smoking, gastric reflux
- Viral and bacterial infections
- Chronic bronchitis
- Long term cigarrete Smoking
- Viral and bacterial infections
- Immunodeficiency
- Long term illness and immobilization

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
- ACUTE BRONCHITIS
${ }^{-}$Initially, the patient has a dry, irritating cough and expectorates a scanty amount of mucoid sputum.
${ }^{\bullet}$ sternal soreness from coughing
${ }^{-}$fever or chills and night sweats,
- headache, and general malaise.
- As the infection progresses, the patient may be short of breath, have noisy inspiration and expiration
- CHRONIC BRONCHITIS
- Productive cough, purulent sputum,
- dyspnea

\section*{Medical management}
- Antibiotic treatment may be indicated depending on the symp- toms, sputum purulence, and results of the sputum culture. Anti- histamines are usually not prescribed because they may cause excessive drying and make secretions more difficult to expectorate.
- Expectorant, mucolytics and bronchodilators may be prescribed.
- Fluid intake is increased to thin the viscous and tenacious secretions.
- Suctioning and bronchoscopy may be needed to remove secretions in chronic conditions
© Immunization against viral agentsi.e H.influenza
- Administer mild analgesics and antipyretics

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT}
- In most cases, treatment of acute bronchitis is largely symptomatic. The patient is advised to rest.
- Increasing the vapor pressure (moisture content) in the air will reduce irritation.
- steam inhalations may help relieve laryngeal and tracheal irritation.
- Advise the to stop smoking and avoid irritants
- Give plenty of fluids to liquefy the secretions

\section*{PNEUMONIA}
- This is the inflammation of the lung parenchyma caused by various microorganisms i.e bacteria, viruses, fungi.
- LOBAR PNEUMONIA-occurs if one or more lobes are involved
- BRONCHOPNEUMONIA-It is distributed in patchy fashion within one of localized area in the bronchi.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}

- Pneumonia arises from normally present flora in a patient whose resistance has been altered, or it results from aspiration of flora present in the oropharynx. It may also result from bloodborne organisms that enter the pulmonary circulation and are trapped in the pulmonary capillary bed. An inflammatory reaction can occur in the alveoli, producing an exudate that interferes with the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Areas of the lung are not adequately ventilated because of secretions and mucosal edema that cause partial occlusion of the bronchi or alveoli, with a resultant decrease in alveolar oxygen tension.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF PNEUMONIA}
- Community-acquired pneumonia -occurs either in the community setting or within the first 48 hours of hospitalization
- Hospital-acquired pneumonia ( nosocomial pneumonia) -is the onset of pneumonia symptoms more than 48 hours after admission to the hospital..
- pneumonia in the immunocompromised host are Pneumocystis carinii , fungal pneumonias, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. Immunocompromised states occur with the use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents, chemotherapy, nutritional depletion, use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, AIDS, , and long-term advanced life-support technology (mechanical ventilation).

\section*{LUNG ABCESS}
- is a localized necrotic lesion of the lung parenchyma containing purulent material that collapses and forms a cavity.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Most lung abscesses are a complication of bacterial pneumonia or are caused by aspiration of oral anaerobes into the lung. Abscesses also may occur secondary to mechanical or functional obstruction of the bronchi by a tumor, foreign body, or bronchial stenosis, or from necrotizing pneumonias, TB, pulmonary embolism, or chest trauma.
Most abscesses are found in areas of the lung that may be affected by aspiration.. If the bronchus is involved, the purulent contents are expectorated continuously in the form of sputum. If the pleura is involved, an empyema results The organisms frequently associated with lung abscesses are S . aureus, Klebsiella, and other gram-negative species

\section*{RISK FACTORS}
${ }^{-}$It is generally caused by aspiration of anaerobic bacteria.
${ }^{-}$Patients who have impaired cough reflexes and cannot close the glottis, or those with swallowing difficulties, are at risk for aspirating foreign material and developing a lung abscess.
- patient with central nervous system disorders (seizure, stroke), drug addiction, alcoholism, esophageal disease, or compromised immune function, those without teeth, patients receiving nasogastric tube feedings
- those with an altered state of consciousness from anesthesia.

\section*{THE CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}
- may vary from a mild productive cough to acute illness
- fever and a productive cough with moderate to copious amounts of foul smelling, often bloody, sputum.
- Leukocytosis may be present.
- dull chest pain,
- Dyspnea, weakness, anorexia, and weight loss are common. Fever and cough may develop insidiously and may have been present for several weeks before diagnosis

\section*{Prevention}
- The following measures will reduce the risk of lung abscess:
- Appropriate antibiotic therapy before any dental procedures in patients who must have teeth extracted while their gums and teeth are infected
- Adequate dental and oral hygiene, because anaerobic bacteria play a role in the pathogenesis of lung abscess
- Appropriate antimicrobial therapy for patients with pneumonia

\section*{MEDICAL MANAGEMENT}

Intravenous antimicrobial therapy depends on the results of he sputum culture and sensitivity and is administered for an extended period i.e. Penicillin G or clindamycin, followed by penicillin with metronidazole. Large intravenous doses are generally required because the antibiotic must penetrate the necrotic tissue and the fluid in the abscess. The intravenous dose is continued until there is evidence of symptom improvement.
Long-term therapy with oral antibiotics replaces intravenous therapy after the patient shows signs of improvement (usually 3 to 5 days) and should be continued for an additional 4 to 8 weeks.
${ }^{-}$Adequate drainage of the lung abscess may be achieved through postural drainage and chest physiotherapy.
${ }^{\bullet}$ The patient should be assessed for an adequate cough. A few patients need a percutaneous chest catheter placed for long-term drainage of the abscess.
- Surgical intervention is rare, but pulmonary resection (lobectomy) is performed when there is massive hemoptysis or little or no response to medical management.
- Pleural Condition
${ }^{-}$Pleural conditions are disorders that involve the membranes covering the lungs (visceral pleura) and the surface of the chest wall (parietal pleura) or disorders affecting the pleural space.

\section*{PLEURISY (pleuritis)}
- refers to inflammation of both layers of the pleurae (parietal and visceral).
-When the inflamed pleural membranes rub together during respiration (intensified on inspiration), the result is severe, sharp, knifelike pain.
${ }^{-}$may develop in conjunction with pneumonia or an upper respiratory tract infection, TB, or collagen disease; after trauma to the chest, pulmonary infarction, or pulmonary embolism; in patients with primary and metastatic cancer; and after thoracotomy, rheumatoid arthritis, pneumothorax, pancreatitis

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}
- The key characteristic of pleuritic pain is its relationship to respiratory movement. Taking a deep breath, coughing, or sneezing worsens the pain.
- Sharp knife like pain (stabbing)
- Pleuritic pain is restricted in distribution rather than diffuse; it usually occurs only on one side. The pain may become minimal or absent when the breath is held, or it may be localized or radiate to the shoulder or abdomen.
- Sometimes chest pain may extend to the shoulder
- Decreased movement on the involved wall
${ }^{-}$Rapid or shallow breathing related to pain

\section*{Medical Management}
${ }^{-}$The objectives of treatment are to discover the underlying condition causing the pleurisy and to relieve the pain.
- monitor for signs and symptoms of pleural effusion, such as shortness of breath, pain,

- Administer Prescribed analgesics i.e. Indocid, (NSAID), and topical applications of heat or cold provide symptomatic relief
- If the pain is severe, an intercostal nerve block may be required.

\section*{Nursing Management}
- Because the patient has considerable pain on inspiration, the nurse can offer suggestions to enhance comfort, such as turning frequently onto the affected side to splint the chest wall and reduce the stretching of the pleurae.
- teach the patient to use the hands or a pillow to splint the rib cage while coughing.
- assumption of a position that decreases pain, and decreased chest wall excursion

\section*{PLEURAL EFFUSION}
- It is a collection of fluid in the pleural space.
- Is rarely a primary disease process but is usually secondary to other diseases.

\section*{CAUSES}
${ }^{-}$may be a complication of heart failure, TB, pneumonia, pulmonary infections (particularly viral infections), nephrotic syndrome, connective tissue disease, pulmonary embolism, and neoplastic tumors, autoimmune disease
- Bronchogenic carcinoma is the most common malignancy associated with a pleural effusion.
${ }^{\text {- }}$ Drugs i.e hydralazine

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}
- The effusion can be clear fluid or bloody. Clear fluid can be transudate which occurs when factors influencing formation and reabsorption of fluid is altered usually by imbalances in hydrostatic pressure.exudate results from inflammation of bacterial products or tumours involving pleural surfaces. The abnormal accumulation in the pleural space cause pain and shortness of breath.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}
${ }^{-}$Usually the clinical manifestations are those caused by the underlying disease.
- Pneumonia causes fever, chills, and pleuritic chest pain, whereas a malignant effusion may result in dyspnea and coughing. The size of the effusion and the patient's underlying lung disease determine the severity of symptoms. A large pleural effusion causes shortness of breath.
- small to moderate pleural effusion is present, dyspnea may be absent or only minimal
${ }^{-}$Pleuritic chest pain
- Decreased or absent breath sound
${ }^{-}$Trachea deviation away from the affected side
${ }^{-}$Dull flat sound on percussion

\section*{Medical Management}

The objectives of treatment are to discover the underlying cause, to prevent reaccumulation of fluid, and to relieve discomfort, dyspnea, and respiratory compromise.
-Specific treatment is directed at the underlying cause .
If the pleural fluid is an exudate, more extensive diagnostic procedures are performed to determine the cause.
Thoracentesis is performed to remove fluid, to obtain a specimen for analysis, and to relieve dyspnea and respiratory compromise . insertion of a chest tube connected to a water-seal drainage system or suction to evacuate the pleural space and re-expand the lung.
surgical pleurectomy,

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT}
- Position patient in higher fowlers position for maximum gaseous and exchange Manage ABC

- Assist the patient in frequent turning and 06/14あるeracentesis procedure

\section*{EMPYEMA}
- is an accumulation of thick, purulent fluid within the pleural space, often with fibrin development and walled-off area where infection is located.

\section*{CAUSES}
- Most occur as complications of bacterial pneumonia or lung abscess.
- Other causes include penetrating chest trauma, hematogenous infection of the pleural space, nonbacterial infections,
- iatrogenic causes (after thoracic surgery or thoracentesis).

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}

- The fluid is drained and appropriate antibiotics, in large doses, are prescribed based on the causative organism for 4 to 6 weeks.
- Drainage of the pleural fluid depends on the stage of the disease and is accomplished by one of the following 06/19method

\section*{ct}
- Tube thoracostomy (chest drainage using a large-diameter intercostal tube attached to water-seal drainage tube in patients with complicated pleural effusions
- Open chest drainage via thoracotomy, including potential rib resection, to remove the thickened pleura, pus, and debris and to remove the underlying diseased pulmonary tissue
- With long-standing inflammation, an exudate must be removed surgically.

\section*{Nursing Management}
- Resolution of empyema is a prolonged process. help the patient cope with the condition and instructs the patient in lung-expanding breathing exercises to restore normal respiratory function.
- Administer prescribed antibiotic
- provide care specific to the method of drainage of the pleural fluid.
- Monitor vital signs especially temperature and respirations
- When a patient is discharged to home with a drainage tube or system in place, instructs the patient and family on care of the drainage system

Medical Management

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY}
- Two general classes of asthma medications are
- quick-relief medications for immediate treatment of asthma symptoms and exacerbations i.e
Short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists, salbutamol Anticholinergics (eg, ipratropium bromide [Atrovent])
Direct muscle relaxant- aminophyline , oral/IV corticosteroids (hydrocortisone,predinisolo
ct
- long-acting medications to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma
- Corticosteroids,i.e prednisone, beclomethasone, budesonide,
- Mast cell stabilizers i.e sodium chromogylcate
- Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agents i.e albuterol, salbutamol

- Combination of inhalers

\section*{Nursing Management}
${ }^{\bullet}$ Obtain history to identify medication patient is currently on and assess the severity of the respiratory symptoms
- Manage for CAB by administering oxygen due circulatory compromise and hypoxemia
- Ensure patent airway by neubilising with salbutamol, combyvent, if no improvement suction to remove secretions but not always indicated
- Maintain good breathing pattern by positioning patient in a semifowlers position
- Continue with neubilisation after every 15 minutes and oxygen therapy until there is improvement breathing and respiration
${ }^{\bullet}$ Ensure bed rest to prevent fatigue and overexertion

${ }^{-}$Reassure the patient to allay anxiety and to promote quick recovery
${ }^{-}$Ensure adequate fluid intake and nutrition
- On discharge teach the patient on common triggers of asthma and avoiding them, drug compliance, use of inhalor

\section*{STATUS ASTHMATICUS}
- is severe and persistent asthma that does not respond to conventional therapy. The attacks can last longer than 24 hours.
- Infection, anxiety, nebulizer abuse, dehydration, increased adrenergic blockage, and nonspecific irritants may contribute to these episodes.
- An acute episode may be precipitated by hypersensitivity to aspirin

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}
- They are the same as those seen in severe asthma:
- labored breathing,
- prolonged exhalation,
engorged neck veins, and wheezing
- Chest tightness
- cyanosis

\section*{Medical Management}
- In the emergency setting, the patient is treated initially with a short acting beta-adrenergic agonist and corticosteroids. (neubilise with salbutamol,IM/IV hydrocotisone)
- Give IV aminophyline in normal saline
- Adminster supplemental oxygen 3-4litres/min to treat dyspnea, central cyanosis, and hypoxemia

\section*{Nursing managent}
- constantly monitor the patient for the first 12 to 24 hours, or until status asthmaticus is under control.
- assesses the patient's skin turgor to identify signs of dehydration.
- Fluid intake is essential to combat dehydration, to loosen secretions, and to facilitate expectoration. The nurse administers intravenous fluids as prescribed, up to 3 to 4 L/day.
${ }^{\text {- }}$ The patient's energy needs to be conserved by bed rest
${ }^{\bullet}$, the room should be quiet and free of respiratory irritants, including flowers, tobacco smoke, perfumes, or odors of cleaning agents.

\section*{Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease}
- (COPD) is a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible.
${ }^{-}$Pathophysiology
- airflow limitation is both progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious(harmful) particles or gases. The inflammatory response occurs throughout the airways, parenchyma, and pulmonary vasculature. Because of the chronic inflammation and the body's attempts to repair it, narrowing occurs in the small peripheral airways. Over time, this injury and repair process causes scar tissue formation and narrowing of the airway lumen.

CAUSES
- Exposure to cigarette smoke
- Chronic respiratory infections
- Process related to proteinases and antiproteinases in the lung
- Release of anti-inflamatory mediators
- Allergic reactions

\section*{Emphysema}
${ }^{-}$is a pathological term that describes an abnormal distention of the air spaces beyond the terminal bronchioles, with destruction of the walls of the alveoli and results in impaired gas exchange
- It is the end stage of a process that has progressed slowly for many years.
- As the walls of the alveoli are destroyed ,the alveolar surface area in direct contact with the pulmonary capillaries continually decreases, causing an increase in dead space and impaired oxygen diffusion, which leads to hypoxemia
- In the later stages of the disease, carbon dioxide elimination is impaired, resulting in hypercapnia and causing respiratory acidosis
- Aetiology
- It is as a result of smoking cigarette, inhalation of coal dust or alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency.

\section*{TYPES}
- panlobular (panacinar)
- there is destruction of the respiratory bronchiole, alveolar duct, and alveoli.. The patient with this type of emphysema typically has a hyperinflated(barrel )chest on physical examination, marked dyspnea on exertion, and weight loss.

CT
- centrilobular (centroacinar)
- pathologic changes take place mainly in the center of the secondary lobule, producing chronic hypoxemia, hypercapnia, polycythemia, and episodes of right-sided heart failure.
- This leads to central cyanosis, peripheral edema, and respiratory failure.

\section*{Risk Factors}
${ }^{-}$cigarette smoking. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoking.
- passive smoking
- a deficiency of alpha1 anti- trypsin, an enzyme inhibitor that protects the lung parenchyma from injury
${ }^{\bullet}$ prolonged exposure to occupational dust and chemical
- Air pollution

- Diffuse airway injury
- Pulmonary infections and obstruction of the bronchus or complications of long-term pulmonary infections
- Genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis
- Abnormal host defense (eg, ciliary dyskinesia or humoral immunodeficiency)
- Idiopathic causes

\section*{CAUSES CNT}
- Inflammatory-Infective process like measles, whooping cough, klebsiella pneumonia, may damage and weaken the bronchial wall resulting in dilatation and cilia damage.
- Obstruction -Proximal obstruction due to foreign body or enlarged lymph nodes results in distal accumulation of secretions which can be infected and cause localized bronchioectasis.
- Congenital factors.
- -Kertageners syndrome (i.e. immotile cilia, transposition of viscera and sinusitis)
- -Immunoglobulin insufficiency. (Secretory Ig G)
- Permanent dilatation of the bronchi and destruction of bronchial elastic and muscular structures.
- It may be localized or generalized throughout the bronchial tree.
- There is impaired clearance of bronchial secretion with secondary bacterial infection

\section*{Predisposing factors}
- recurrent respiratory infections in early childhood, measles, influenza, tuberculosis immunodeficiency disorders.
- TYPES
- Cylindrical
- Cystic
- varicose

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- The inflammatory process associated with pulmonary infections damages the bronchial wall, causing a loss of its supporting structure and resulting in thick sputum that ultimately obstructs the bronchi.
- The walls become permanently distended and distorted, impairing mucociliary clearance.
This results in retained secretions and subsequent obstruction that cause the alveoli distal to the obstruction to collapse. . Inflammatory scarring or fibrosis replaces functioning lung tissue.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}
- chronic cough and the production of purulent sputum in copious amounts.
- hemoptysis.
- Clubbing of the fingers also is common because of respiratory insufficiency.
- repeated episodes of pulmonary infection.
- Abnormal chest sounds-Coarse crackles over affected
- Weight loss and fatigue

\section*{Investigations}
- -Radiology- chest x-ray, CT scan, bronchography
- -Sputum culture- common organisms found are staphylococcal aureas, Pseudomonas Aeriginosa and haemophilus influenza.
- -Other tests like serum Ig or sweat test.

\section*{Medical Management}

Treatment objectives are to promote bronchial drainage to clear excessive secretions from the affected portion of the lungs and to prevent or control infection.
${ }^{\text {e Postural drainage draining reduces the amount of }}$ secretions and the degree of infection.
Chest physiotherapy.
©Smoking cessation is important because smoking impairs bronchial drainage by paralyzing ciliary action, increasing bronchial secretions, and causing inflammation of the mucous membrane

\section*{ct}
- A year-round regimen of antibiotic agents may be prescribed, with different types of antibiotics at intervals.
${ }^{\bullet}$ Patients should be vaccinated against influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia.
${ }^{\bullet}$ Bronchodilators, which may be prescribed for patients who also have reactive airway disease, may also assist with secretion management.
- Surgical intervention, may be indicated for the patient who continues to expectorate large amounts of sputum and has repeated bouts of pneumonia and hemoptysis despite adhering to the treatment regimen.

\section*{Mngt summary}

\section*{CYSTIC FIBROSIS}
${ }^{-}$It is an inherited chronic disease that affect lung and digestive system
- A defective gene and its protein product cause the body to produce unusually thick mucus that clogs the lung.
- Usually diagnosed in early infancy or early childhood

\section*{Pathophysiology}
${ }^{-}$is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein, which is a chloride channel found in all exocrine tissues.
- Chloride transport problems lead to thick, viscous secretions in the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and reproductive tract as well as increased salt content in sweat gland secretions.
- Airflow obstruction is a key feature in the presentation of CF.
${ }^{\bullet}$ This obstruction is due to bronchial plugging by purulent secretions, bronchial wall thickening due to inflammation, and, over time, airway destruction.
${ }^{-}$These chronic retained secretions in the airways set up an excellent reservoir for continued bronchial infections.

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}
- a productive cough
- wheezing
- hyperinflation of the lung fields on chest xray,
- pulmonary function test results consistent with obstructive airways.
- Upper respiratory manifestations of the disease include sinusitis and nasal polyps.

Bronchodilators are frequently administered to decrease airway obstruction.
- manual postural drainage and chest physical therapy, are used to enhance secretion clearance

\section*{ct}
- Inhaled mucolytic agents such as dornase alfa (Pulmozyme) or - (Mucomyst) may also be used to decrease the viscosity of the sputum and promote expectoration of secretions.
${ }^{-}$To decrease the inflammation and ongoing destruction of the airways, antiinflammatory agents may also be used. i.e inhaled corticosteroids or systemic therapy.
- Supplemental oxygen is used to treat the progressive hypoxemia

\section*{Nursing management}

- Evidence indicates that carcinoma tends to arise at sites of previous scarring (TB, fibrosis) in the lung.
- More than 85\% of lung cancers are caused by the inhalation of carcinogenic chemicals, most commonly cigarette smoke

\section*{CLASSIFICATION AND STAGING}
${ }^{\bullet}$ Most are classified as small cell lung cancer and non-small cell cancer.
- Non-small cell is further classified with cell types
- Squamous cell cancer usually centrally located and arises more in segmental and sub segmental bronchi
- Adenocarcinoma - most prevalent. occurs peripherally and often metastizes(undifferentiated)
- Large cell carcinoma- is a fast growing tumour that tend to arise peripherally(undifferentiated)
${ }^{\bullet}$ Bronchoalveolar found in terminal bronchi and alveoli and usually slow growing
- Small cell carcinoma arise in the major bronchi and spread by infiltration along the bronchial wall

\section*{staging}
- Staged according to tumour size, lymphoid involvement, location, and if metastized
- Non -small cell carcinoma is staged as
- Stage 1- cancer small and only in one area of the lung
- Stage 2\&3-tumour is larger and may have grown into the surrounding tissue and lymphnodes
- Stage IV-cancer has spread into the other body parts

Risk factors

- Non specific symptoms- weakness, anorexia and weight loss

\section*{MEDICAL MANAGEMENT}
${ }^{-}$Treatment depend on the cell type, stage of the disease and physiologic status
- Surgical resection is the preferred method of treating patients with localized non-small cell tumors, no evidence of metastatic spread, and adequate cardiopulmonary function
- Radiation therapy may cure a small percentage of patients. It is useful in controlling neoplasms that cannot be surgically resected but are responsive to radiation. also may be used to reduce the size of a tumor, to make an inoperable tumor operable, or to relieve the pressure of the tumor on vital structures. It can control symptoms of spinal cord metastasis and superior vena caval compression
- Chemotherapy is used to alter tumor growth patterns, to treat patients with distant metastases or small cell cancer of the lung, and as an adjunct to surgery or radiation therapy
- Palliative therapy may include radiation therapy to shrink the tumor to provide pain relief, a variety of bronchoscopic interventions to open a narrowed bronchus or airway, and pain management and other comfort measures.
- Evaluation and referral to hospice is essential

\section*{Nursing management}

- Hypoxemia from disruption of the airway; injury to the lung parenchyma, rib cage, and respiratory musculature; massive hemorrhage; collapsed lung; and pneumothorax
- Hypovolemia from massive fluid loss from the great vessels, cardiac rupture, or hemothorax
- Cardiac failure from cardiac tamponade, cardiac contusion, or increased intrathoracic pressure

\section*{FLAIL CHEST}
- It usually occurs when three or more adjacent ribs (multiple contiguous ribs) are fractured at two or more sites, resulting in free floating rib segments.
${ }^{-}$It may also result as a combination fracture of ribs and costal cartilages or sternum .

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}
- During inspiration, as the chest expands, the detached part of the rib segment (flail segment) moves in a paradoxical manner movement, in that it is pulled inward during inspiration, reducing the amount of air that can be drawn into the lungs. On expiration, because the intrathoracic pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure, the flail segment bulges outward, impairing the patient's ability to exhale. The mediastinum then shifts back to the affected side. This paradoxical action results in increased dead space, a reduction in alveolar ventilation, and decreased compliance

Clinical manifestations
- hypoxemia, if gas exchange is greatly compromised,
- respiratory acidosis develops as a result of CO2 retention
- Hypotension, due to inadequate tissue perfusion,
- metabolic acidosis due paradoxical motion of the mediastinum decreases cardiac output.

\section*{Medical management}
- treatment of flail chest is usually supportive. Management includes providing ventilatory support, clearing secretions from the lungs, and controlling pain.
The specific management depends on the degree of respiratory dysfunction. If only a small segment of the chest is involved, the objectives are to clear the airway through positioning, coughing, deep breathing, and suctioning to aid in the expansion of the lung, and to relieve pain by intercostal nerve blocks.
${ }^{\text {F }}$ For mild to moderate flail chest injuries, the underlying pulmonary contusion is treated by monitoring fluid intake and appropriate fluid replacement, while at the same time relieving chest pain.
${ }^{-}$Pulmonary physiotherapy focusing on lung volume expansion and secretion management techniques are performed. The patient is closely monitored for further respiratory compromise.
When a severe flail chest injury is encountered, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation

\section*{ct}
-surgery may be required to more quickly stabilize the flail segment. This may be used in the patient who is difficult to ventilate or the high-risk patient with underlying lung disease who may be difficult to wean from mechanical
ventilation the patient is carefully monitored by serial chest x-rays, arterial blood gas analysis, pulse oximetry, and bedside pulmonary function monitoring.

\section*{Pulmonary Contusion}
- It is damage to the lung tissues resulting in hemorrhage and localized edema. It is associated with chest trauma when there is rapid compression and decompression to the chest wall

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}
- injury to the lung parenchyma and its capillary network results in a leakage of serum protein and plasma. The leaking serum protein exerts an osmotic pressure that enhances loss of fluid from the capillaries. Blood, edema, and cellular debris enter the lung and accumulate in the bronchioles and alveolar surface, where they interfere with gas exchange. An increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure occurs. The patient has hypoxemia and carbon dioxide retention.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}
- tachypnea, tachycardia, pleurisy chest pain, hypoxemia, and blood-tinged secretions,, crackles, frank bleeding, severe hypoxemia, and respiratory acidosis.
- patient with moderate pulmonary contusion has a large amount of mucus, serum, and frank blood in the tracheobronchial tree.
- A patient with severe pulmonary contusion has the signs and symptoms of ARDS; these may include central cyanosis, agitation, and productive cough with frothy, bloody secretions.

\section*{MEDICAL MANAGEMENT}
${ }^{\bullet}$ Treatment priorities include maintaining the airway, providing adequate oxygenation, and controlling pain.
- Supplemental oxygen is usually given by mask or cannula for 24 to 36 h .
- In mild pulmonary contusion, adequate hydration via intravenous fluids and oral intake is important to mobilize secretions. However, must be closely monitored to avoid hypervolemia.
- Volume expansion techniques, postural drainage, physiotherapy including coughing, and endotracheal suctioning are used to remove the secretions.
- Pain is managed by intercostal nerve blocks or by opioids.
${ }^{\bullet}$ antimicrobial therapy is administered because the damaged lung is susceptible to infection.
- moderate pulmonary contusion may require bronchoscopy to remove secretions; intubation and mechanical ventilation with PEEP may also be necessary to maintain the pressure and keep the lungs inflated.
- Diuretics may be given to reduce edema.
- A nasogastric tube is inserted to relieve gastrointestinal distention.
- severe contusion require aggressive treatment with endotracheal intubation and ventilatory support, diuretics, and fluid restriction. Colloids and crystalloid solutions may be used to treat ${ }^{42} \mathrm{H}^{25} \mathrm{v}$ povolemia.

\section*{PENETRATING TRAUMA}
- Occurs when a foreign object penetrates into the chest wall
- Causes
- Gun shot and stab wound
- Stab wounds are of low velocity and thus destroy small area
- Gunshot may be of low, medium or high velocity depending with distance
${ }^{\ominus}$, caliber of gun and bullet

\section*{Management}
- Objective management is to restore and maintain cardiopulmonary function
- Adequate airway and ventilation is established and maintained
- Assess for shock and treated simultaneously with colloid, crystacolloid solution or blood as indicated by patient condition
- Diagnostic investigations are done i.e chest x-ray, arterial blood gases, pulse oximetry and ECG, blood grouping and cross matching
- Chest tube inserted for pleural drainage
- Surgical intervention in penetrating wound of the heart, great vessels.

\section*{PNEUMOTHORAX}
- occurs when the parietal or visceral pleura is breached and the pleural space is exposed to positive atmospheric pressure.
- negative pressure is required to maintain lung inflation.
- When either pleura is breached, air enters the pleural space, and the lung or a portion of it collapses.
- Types of pneumothorax include simple, traumatic, and tension pneumothorax.

\section*{Simple(spontaneous) Pneumothorax}
- Most commonly this occurs as air enters the pleural space through the rupture of a bleb or a bronchopleural fistula.
- A spontaneous pneumothorax may occur in an apparently healthy person in the absence of trauma due to rupture of an airfilled bleb, or blister, on the surface of the lung,.
${ }^{-}$It may be associated with diffuse interstitial lung disease and severe emphysema.

\section*{Traumatic Pneumothorax}
${ }^{-}$occurs when air escapes from a laceration in the lung itself and enters the pleural space or enters the pleural space through a wound in the chest wall.

\section*{causes}
- blunt trauma (eg, rib fractures) or penetrating chest trauma.
${ }^{\text {- }}$ abdominal trauma (eg, stab wounds or gun- shot wounds to the abdomen) and from diaphragmatic tears.
- invasive thoracic procedures (ie, thoracentesis, transbronchial lung biopsy, insertion of subclavian line

\section*{ct}

Traumatic pneumothorax is often accompanied by
${ }^{\text {Ohemothorax }}$ (collection of blood in the pleural space resulting from torn intercostal vessels, lacerations of the great vessels, and lacerations of the lungs). hemopneumothorax Often both blood and air are found in the chest cavity.

\section*{ct}

Open pneumothorax. It occurs when a wound in the chest wall is large enough to allow air to pass freely in and out of the thoracic cavity with each attempted respiration.
Because the rush of air through the hole in the chest wall produces a sucking sound, such injuries are termed sucking chest wounds.
In such patients, not only does the lung collapse, but the structures of the mediastinum (heart and great vessels) also shift toward the uninjured side with each inspiration and in the opposite direction with expiration.
This is termed mediastinal flutter or swing, and it produces serious circulatory problems.

\section*{ct}
- Tension Pneumothorax
${ }^{\bullet}$ occurs when air is drawn into the pleural space from a lacerated lung or through a small hole in the chest wall.
- It may be a complication of other types of pneumothorax. air that enters the chest cavity with each inspiration is trapped; it cannot be expelled during expiration through the air passages or the hole in the chest wall.
- With each breath, tension (positive pressure) is increased within the affected pleural space.
${ }^{-}$This causes the lung to collapse and the heart, the great vessels, and the trachea to shift toward the unaffected side of the chest (mediastinal shift).
- Relief considered a medical emergency

Clinical Manifestations
- Simple pneumothorax
- Pain is usually sudden and may be pleuritic
- minimal respiratory distress with slight chest discomfort and tachypnea with a small simple or uncomplicated pneumothorax.
- largepneumothorax,
- acute respiratory distress.
- The patient is anxious,
- dyspnea and air hunger,

\section*{ct}
increased use of the accessory muscles, and may develop central cyanosis from severe hypoxemia
- tachypnea,
- decreased movement of the affected side of the thorax, a tympanic sound on percussion of the chest wall
- decreased or absent breath sounds and tactile fremitus on the affected side

Tension pneumothorax- air hunger, agitation, increasing hypoxemia, central cyanosis, hypotension, tachycardia, and profuse diaphoresis.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Sudden sharp chest pain
${ }^{-}$Cough
- Sudden shortness of breath with violent but futile respiratory effort
${ }^{-}$Fall in Bp
- Weak and rapid pulse
${ }^{\bullet}$ Hyper resonance on the affected side
- Apprehension
- Anxiety and restlessness
${ }^{\bullet}$ Diaphoresis (sweating profusely)
${ }^{-}$pallor or cyanosis
- faintness, feeling of tightness in chest
${ }^{-}$decreased or absent breath sounds over collapsed lung
${ }^{-}$cessation of normal chest movement of the affected side
- Open sucking wounds for open pneumothorax

\section*{Medical management}
- Management depends on its cause and severity.
- The goal of treatment is to evacuate the air or blood from the pleural space.
${ }^{-}$If a tension pneumothorax is suspected, the patient should
${ }^{-}$immediately be given a high concentration of supplemental oxygen to treat the hypoxemia, and pulse oximetry should be used to monitor oxygen saturation.
- In an emergency situation, a tension pneumothorax can be de- compressed or quickly converted to a simple pneumothorax by inserting a large-bore needle (14-gauge) at the second intercostal
${ }^{-}$space,

\section*{ct}
- chest tube is inserted to drain the fluid and air.
- Opiod analgesics administered to relieve chest pain
- Antibiotics usually are prescribed to combat infection from contamination.
- An emergency thoracotomy may also be performed in the emergency department if there is suggested cardiovascular injury

\section*{Nursing consideration}
- -If patient develops symptoms of pneumothorax
${ }^{-}$Remain with him and keep him as calm and quiet a possible
- Place him in a sitting position and encourage him to control the coughing
${ }^{\text {- }}$ Have another nurse notify the physician without causing alarm to patient.
- Prepare thoracocentesis equipment at the bedside
- Obtain arterial blood gases
- Administer $0_{2}$ to relieve dyspnoea if necessary
${ }^{\bullet}$ Evaluate pulse and resp. rates for indications of shock and respiratory distress.

Chest tube drainage

\section*{Indications}
${ }^{-}$Re-expand the lung
${ }^{-}$Remove excess air fluid and blood from the pleural space
- Treatment of pneumothorax, pleural effusion,
- Emphysema
- Chest drainage systems have a suction source, a collection chamber for pleural drainage, and a mechanism to prevent air from reentering the chest with inhalation.

\section*{types}
- Water Seal Chest Drainage Systems( wet suction)
- has three chambers: a collection chamber, a water seal chamber, and a wet suction control chamber.
- The collection chamber acts as a reservoir for fluid draining from the chest tube.
- It is graduated to permit easy measurement of drainage..
- The suction control chamber regulates the amount of negative pressure applied to the chest.
- The amount of suction is determined by the water level.
- It is generally set at $20-\mathrm{cm}$ water; adding more fluid results in more suction. After the suction is turned on, bubbling appears in the suction chamber..
- The water seal chamber has a one-way valve or water seal that prevents air from moving back into the chest.

\section*{ct}
- Dry Suction Water Seal Systems
- Water is not needed for suction as it is in the wet system
- the regulator dial allows the desired level of suction to be dialed
${ }^{\bullet}$ Dry Suction with a One-Way Valve System. This system has a collection chamber, a one-way mechanical valve, and a dry suction control chamber.
${ }^{-}$The valve acts in the same way as a water seal and permits air to leave the chest but prevents it from moving back into the pleural space.
${ }^{\text {- }}$ This model lacks a water seal chamber and therefore has the advantage of a system that operates without water.
${ }^{\bullet}$ useful for the patient who is ambulating or being transported.

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR MANAGING CHEST DRAINAGE SYSTEMS}

1- Verify that all connection tubes are patent and connected securely.
2 - Assess that the water seal is intact when using a wet suction system and assess the regulator dial in dry suction systems.
3 - Monitor characteristics of drainage including color, amount, and consistency. Assess for significant increases or decreases in drainage output.
4- Note fluctuations in the water seal chamber for wet suction systems.
5- Keep system below the patient's chest level.
6 - Keep suction at level ordered.
7 - Maintain appropriate fluid in water seal for wet suction systems.

\section*{ct}
${ }^{\text {- }}$ 8. Ensure that the drainage tubing does not kink, loop, or interfere with the patient's movements.
- 9. Encourage the patient to assume a comfortable position with good body alignment.
- 10Assist patient with ROM exercises on the affected arm 11.Observe for air leaks in the drainage system; they are indicated by constant bubbling in the water seal chamber
- 12. Observe and immediately report rapid and shallow breathing, cyanosis,, symptoms of hemorrhage, or significant changes in vital signs.
13.Encourage and assist the patient to turn, cough, and take deep breaths.

\section*{ATELECTASIS}

Refers to closure or collapse of the alveoli may be acute or chronic in its onset PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The trapped alveolar air becomes absorbed into the bloodstream, but outside air cannot replace the absorbed air because of the blockage thus the isolated portion of the lung becomes airless and the alveoli collapse.
CAUSES:
$\checkmark$ retained secretions
$\checkmark$ pain
$\checkmark$ alterations in small airway function
$\checkmark$ prolonged supine positioning
increased abdominal pressure
$\checkmark$ reduced lung volumes due to musculoskeletal or neurologic disorders
$\checkmark$ specific surgical procedures (eg, upper abdominal,
thoracic, or open heart surgery)
$\checkmark$ Persistent low lung volumes, secretions or a mass obstructing or impeding airflow
$\checkmark$ Compression of lung tissue may all cause collapse or obstruction of the airways

The causes of atelectasis in postoperative patients
$\checkmark$ low tidal breathing- results from the effects of anesthesia or analgesic agents
$\checkmark$ supine positioning
$\checkmark$ retention of secretions,
$\checkmark$ airway obstruction
$\checkmark$ impaired cough reflex / reluctant to cough because ofpain.
$\checkmark$ Restriction of normal lung expansion on inspiration as a result of:
$\checkmark$ Pressure from-pleural effusion, pneumothorax or hemothorax.
$\checkmark$ Excassive sedation
- Cough
- sputum production
- low-grade fever
- Respiratory distress
- Dyspnea
- Tachycardia
- Tachypnea
- pleural pain
- central cyanosis

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
- Decreased breath sounds and crackles are heard over the affected area
- X-ray findings-Patchy infiltrates, consolidated areas
- Hypoxemia- by pulse oximetry(SpO2) may demonstrate a low saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen (less than $90 \%$ ) OR a lower-than-normal partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2).

\section*{PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT}

GOAL- to improve ventilation and remove secretions
- Frequent turning
- Frequent suctioning /nebulization
- Physiotherapy(postural drainage and chest percussion)
- Deep-breathing maneuvers (at least every 2 hours)- increases lung expansion minimizing airway closure
- Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation with e.g exniratory pressure or

\section*{TUBERCULOSIS}
- Infectious bacterial disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis an acid fast rod shaped bacillus.
- Most commonly develops as a:
$\checkmark$ pulmonary disease
$\checkmark$ Extra-pulmonary disease
MODES OF TRANSMISSION: Through aerosolized infected droplet nuclei by mainly coughing although laughing, talking, sneezing, singing and spitting can lead to contamination of droplets.
- The infectious patient is that person with a positive sputum smear.
- The leading cause of adult deaths worldwide
- Every year 1.6 million people die from TB

OTHER MYCOBACTERIA NOT ASSOCIATED WITH TB
MYCOBACTERIUM LEPRAE
- Lepromatous leprosy
- Tuberculoid leprosy

MYCOBACTERIUM AVIUM- INTERCELLULARE COMPLEX
- Asymptomatic colonization
- Pulmonary disease
- Disseminated disease in HIV Patients

OTHER MYCOBACTERIA
- Mycbacterium kansasi-pulmonary disease
- Mycobacterium ulcerans-cutaneous disease
- Anyone can develop disease
- Shortly after infection with the bacteria
- Many months to years after infection
- Reactivation of previous disease
- In the majority of persons infected with the tubercle bacilli the immune system is able to contain the infection and the bacilli remain dormant for the rest of a person's life and do not lead to disease

\section*{RISK FOR EXPOSURE}
- Duration of exposure/contact with infected cases important for healthcare workers or household contacts
- Concentration of infectious TB in the airinfluenced by:
$\checkmark$ Poor Ventilation
$\checkmark$ Poor Lighting
$\checkmark$ High number of infected patients normally in contact with the person -important in family/urban slums

\section*{RISK OF DEVELOPING DISEASE FOLLOWING INFECTION}
- Extremes of age
- Gender (less in females?)
- HIV infection
- Diabetes Mellitus
- Alcoholism
- Tobacco smoking
- Treatment with immunosuppressive agents.

\section*{CLASSIFICATIONS OF CLINICAL TB}
1. New Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) - patients who have never been treated before-(Smear positive PTB or category 1 patients)
2. Extra-Pulmonary Tuberculosis (category 2)- also placed in category 3 often smear negative
3. Previously treated smear positive PTB relapses or treatment failures or return after default (also called smear positive re-treatment cases) (category 3). These patients may have drug resistant TB.
- All smear positive re-treatment cases should have sputum TB culture and drug susceptibility testing to exclude drug resistance and especially multi-drug resistant TB.
4. Other re-treatment cases - smear negative PTB cases that have previously been treated or EPTB in a patient previously treated for TB.

\section*{PROGRESION OF PULMONARY TB}
i. Pneumonia like symptoms
ii. Granuloma formation with fibrosis
iii. Caseous necrosis
- Tissue becomes dry \& amorphous
- Mixture of protein \& fat (assimilated very slowly)
iv. Calcification-Ca++ salts deposited
v. Cavity formation-Center liquefies \& empties into bronchi
- The bacilli of TB infect the lung, forming a tubercle (lesion).
- The tubercle:
$\checkmark$ May heal, leaving scar tissue.
$\checkmark$ May continue as a granuloma, then heal, or be reactivated.
$\checkmark$ May eventually proceed to necrosis, liquefaction, sloughing, and cavitation.
- The initial lesion may disseminate tubercle bacilli to adjacent tissues through:
$\checkmark$ hematogenous spread
$\checkmark$ via the lymphatic system
$\checkmark$ through the bronchi.
- Extrapulmonary TB occurs more commonly in children and immunocompromised individuals often involving the lymph nodes, bones, joints, pleural space, pericardium, CNS, GU tissue, the peritoneum.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}
- Persistent cough(> 3 wks)
- Blood stained sputum
- Night sweats
- weight loss> $10 \%$
- chest pain
- shortness of breath
1.sputum test -The only means of establishing diagnois
- sputum TB culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST)-reserved for: the evaluation of all smear positive and negative PTB patients, who have failed initial treatment, relapsed or defaulters
2.The radiographic features suggestive of PTB - upper zone patchy shadows with evidence of cavitation and scarring (fibrosis).
- The chest x-ray- may aid the diagnosis of PTB but it should never be used as the sole means of establishing a TB diagnosis.

\section*{Ct diagnosis}
3.Raised ESR
4. Nucleic acid detection tests E.G Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) very sensitive and specific for TB
5. In HIV infected persons the radiological features include:
$\checkmark$ the lower or mid-zone shadows
$\checkmark$ the presence of hilar or mediastinal lymph node enlargement
$\checkmark$ Miliary mottling
$\checkmark$ pleural and/ or pericardial effusion
- Smear negative PTB should be diagnosed in patients with:
$\checkmark$ a cough of longer than two weeks
$\checkmark$ chest radiographic findings consistent with TB
$\checkmark$ at least three sputum smears negative for AFBs
$\checkmark$ lack of response to a trial of broad spectrum antimicrobials excluding fluoroquionolnes.

Differential diagnosis of PTB esp In a person presenting with a chronic cough and negative sputum smears
- include pneumonia especially Pneumocytis jirovecii
- lung abscess
- lung cancer
- sarcoidosis
- bronchiectasis.
- When the diagnosis of TB is in doubt the patient should be referred to the next level for appropriate evaluation.
- The presentation and diagnostic approach to extra-pulmonary TB will depend on site of disease.
- patients often present with Signs of severe disease
1.Tuberculous Pleural effusion and empyema with consequent pyopneumothorax.
CLINICAL FEATURES
$\checkmark$ chest pain
$\checkmark$ breathlessness
$\checkmark$ fever and night sweats.

- painless and initially firm and discrete but eventually become fluctuant and matted together with eventual sinus formation and pus discharge.
4.Intracranial TB-tuberculous meningitis(TBM)

Onset is gradual with:
$\checkmark$ headache
$\checkmark$ vomiting
$\checkmark$ neck stiffness
$\checkmark$ cranial nerve palsies
$\checkmark$ Convulsions
$\checkmark$ loss of speech
$\checkmark$ loss of power in one or more limbs.
- If untreated TB meningitis leads to a gradual change in level of consciousness with eventual coma and death
diagnosis:
- clinical suspicion
- examination of cerebrospinal fluid-Usually the CSF has a high cell count (mainly lymphocytes), low sugar and high protein. The ZN stain is rarely positive (less than $10 \%)$ while TB culture yields poorly.
- brain CT- show basal enhancement

\section*{5.Intestinal TB and Tuberculous ascites}

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}
$\checkmark$ progressive vague abdominal pain
$\checkmark$ abdominal distension
$\checkmark$ vague abdominal mass with doughy feeling
$\checkmark$ Fever wasting
$\checkmark$ diarrhea -may alternate with constipation.

\section*{6.Miliary TB}
usually presents with gradual onset of fever
$\checkmark$ malaise
$\checkmark$ night sweats
$\checkmark$ Wasting
$\checkmark$ Patient has very little respiratory symptoms
$\checkmark$ The chest x-ray shows multiple small millet-sized nodular shadows.
- The diagnosis is often missed but can be confirmed through culture of blood, CSF, which may be positive for tubercle bacilli

GENERAL APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT OF TB
$1^{\text {st }}$ Priority: Administrative Controls
1. Early diagnosis and assessment of cases
- High index of suspicion if
-Persistent cough (eg. >3 weeks)
-Bloody sputum, night sweats, fever, weight loss
-HIV or immunocompromised patients
-Close or household contact of someone with TB
- Acid-fast bacilli smear positive (ideally, 3 samples)
- Diagnosis should be made quickly in an OPD
- Communicate results immediately
$2^{\text {nd }}$ Priority: Environmental Controls
- Maximize natural ventilation
- Control for direction of airflow
- Provide separate waiting area for TB patients

3rd Priority: Personal Protective Equipment
- Use of masks to cover nose and mouth
- health workers to use respirator masks or N-95 msks

\section*{PREVENTING TRANSMISSION}
- Screen suspected and confirmed TB cases promptly
- Educate on cough hygiene
- Separate patients suspected to have TB
- Investigate for TB and refer immediately
- Provide HIV Management Services
1. To cure patients and therefore prevent suffering and death from TB
2. To prevent long term complications of TB
3. To prevent relapse of the disease
4. To prevent transmission of the infection
5. To prevent the development of resistant tubercle bacilli
- currently most anti-TB drugs are available as tablets containing multiple drugs in Fixed Dose Combinations (FDC). There are five primary drugs used to treat TB: isoniazid (H), Rifampicin (R), Pyrazinamide (Z), Ethambutol (E) and Streptomycin (S)

\section*{DIRECT OBSERVED TREATMENT}
- Current strategy is through the Direct Observation of Treatment (DOT) where:
- treatment is promoted using a treatment supporter who is acceptable and accountable to the patient and to the health system.
- This treatment supporter could be health care worker, a family member or a community volunteer
- The DOT may take place at home, workplace, health facility or other convenient place agreeable to the patient, the treatment supporter and the health care system.

\section*{NOTE}
- All patients started on treatment in the health facility should be entered in the treatment register and patient's TB treatment card (and the patient appointment card)
- Patients on TB treatment should be monitored for clinical and bacteriologic response.
- For smear positive PTB patients a follow up sputum smear should be carried out at the completion of the intensive phase of treatment and at the end of treatment.
- Patients who have a positive smear at the end of the intensive phase should have the intensive phase extended for not more than one month and weekly sputum smears until these become negative at which point they should be switched to the continuation phase
- Patients who still have a positive smear at month 4 should be considered to have failed initial treatment and switched to the re-treatment regimen (2SRHZE/1HRZE/5RHE).

\section*{Currently TB treatment is standardized}
1. TB treatment in nomadic populations-TB manyattas.
- The re-treatment regimen for nomadic patients with relapse (R), treatment failure (F), or treatment resumed (TR), with active tuberculosis disease and who have a positive sputum smear or culture result however remains the same and is:
2SRHZE/4RHZE
- In general pregnancy should be avoided during antiTB treatment. However when it occurs all pregnant women with active TB should be treated with a full complement of anti-TB drugs.
BUT -1. If patient Is on Isoniazid, MUST be given Pyridoxine to avoid risk of infant's damage-nervous system.
2. Streptomycin should not used in pregnancy -may cause deafness in the infant-ototoxic
3.When treating drug resistant TB the aminoglycosides (kanamycin, amikacin and capreomycin) should not be used-ototoxic, nephrotoxic
4. the thioamides (ethionamide and prothionamide) should not be used in pregnancy-GI disturbance, hepatptoxic

\section*{TUBERCULOSIS IN CHILDREN}

The ultimate prevention of TB in children is through immunization with BCG
- Children usually have low organism numbers, rare cavitation thus often develop extra pulmonary TB(EPTB), and severe and disseminated TB compared to adults (e.g. miliary TB and TB meningitis)
- Treatment outcomes in children are generally good
- The management of all children with TB should be in line with the DOTS strategy
- As in adults anti-tuberculosis treatment is divided into two phases
- The intensive phase uses at least three

\section*{Anti-tuberculosis drug dosages for children}

Drug

Isoniazid

Rifampicin

Pyrazinamide

Ethambutol*

Streptomycin

Daily dosage in mg/kg (maximum)
$5-10(300 \mathrm{mg})$
$10-20(600 \mathrm{mg})$
$25-40(2000 \mathrm{mg})$

- A child who is not responding to TB treatment should be referred for further assessment and management.
- On commencing anti TB treatment, children usually demonstrate immune reconstitution syndrome
- Failure of treatment in confirmed TB

\section*{OTHER IMPORTANT CARE}
- Health education
- Nutritional Support for TB Patients
- Avoid / reduce amount of Alcohol and Tobacco during Treatment for TB Alcohol is injurious to the liver

MAJOR CAUSE-non-adherence to treatment-:
- by governments-failure to provide political support and stewardship in the fight against TB
- by health care providers through failure to prescribe efficacious regimens for the treatment of TB
- by patients through failure to adhere to the prescribed treatment until it is completed.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF RESISTANCE}
1. Primary if there is definitely no previous treatment
2. Initial when previous treatment cannot definitely be excluded
3. Acquired if there is a definite history of previous treatment
- MONO DRUG RESISTANCE-Mycobacterium resistant to one first line antituberculous drug
- POLY DRUG RESISTANT TB(PDR TB)Mycobacterium resistant to more than one first line other than rifampicin and isoniazid
- MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT TB-(MDR TB)Mycobacterium resistant to atleast Isoniazid and Rifampicin
- EXTENSILY DRUG RESISTANT TB (XDR-TB)- Due to MDR TB resistant toany fluoroquinolones and atleast one injectable agent(Amikacin, kanamyci, capreomycin)
- NB-Both pulmonary and extra pulmonary and PTB may be drug resistant

KENYA DRUG REGIMEN FOR TREATING MDRTB
An intensive phase-lasting 6 months in which an injectable will be used under strict DOT and preferably in hospital.
Atleat five drugs must be used
i. Pyrazinamide: This drug is chosen because it is thought that the M.tb bacilli retain some susceptibility to it
ii. Ethionamide.
iii. Capreomycin is chosen because the aminoglycosides (Kanamycin and Amikacin) have been available for a long time in Kenya and have been extensively used for treating non-tuberculous infertions
iv) Cycloserine.
v) Ofloxacin.

NB Ethambutol will be used only in those patients where susceptibility to the drug is confirmed by DST. If resistance to this drug is present, PAS will be used instead

Continuation phase - for 18 months after culture conversion and should be administered as DOT on an ambulatory basis consisting of:
i. Ofloxacin.
ii. Cycloserine.
iii. Ethionamide.
iv. Pyrazinamide or PAS

\end{tabular}

\section*{TREATMENT MONITORING}
- During the intensive phase patients should be seen daily
NOTE
$\checkmark$ Take daily temperature, pulse and respiratory rate
$\checkmark$ weight monitoring be done weekly.
$\checkmark$ Appearance of adverse events should be recorded and the event categorized whether mild, moderate or severe

\section*{IMPORTANT ADVERSE EFFECTS}
-Anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions
-Electrolyte abnormalities especially hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia
- Gastrointestinal disturbances
- Headaches,seizures, depression
- Hepatitis-hepatotoxicity
-Hypothyroidism with use of PAS or thiamides
-Musculoskeletal effects
-Nephrotoxicity
-Ototoxicity
-Peripheral neuropathy

MANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE EFFECTSdepends on severity of symptoms
- Treatment withdrawal
- Counteracting the adverse event with another drug e.g. an anti-emetic for vomiting
- Drug dose reduction.

NB: All adverse events irrespective of the severity must be recorded in the patient record card.

\section*{TB TREATMENT OUTCOMES}
1. Cured (C): This is a tuberculosis patient who was initially sputum-smear positive and has a negative sputum smear at the end of treatment.
2. Treatment completed (TC): This is a tuberculosis patient who has completed his treatment as required but has not had a sputum smear-examination done at the end of treatment.
3. Out of control (OOC): A tuberculosis patient who has not attended two consecutive clinics and all efforts to find him/her and bring him/her back to treatment have failed.
4. Transferred out (TO): A patient who is transferred to continue treatment in another district and whose treatment outcome is therefore unknown at the initial treatment facility.
5. Failure (F): A tuberculosis patient who is still sputum smear-positive after $4 / 5$ or 6/8 months of treatment.
6. Died (D): A tuberculosis patient who died during treatment of any cause whatsoever.

\section*{TREATMENT FOR XDR-TB}

Regime is individualized to include the following group of drugs
1. One injectable agent
2. Higher generation fluoroquinolone
3. A first line drug
4. Oral bacteriostatic second line
5. One drug from the third line

CURRENT REGIME consists of:
INTENSIV E PHSE-12 MONTHS:
1. Capreomycin
2. Moxifloxacin
3. Pyrazinamide
4. PAS
5. Clofazimine/AMX/CLAV CONTINUATION PHASE-18 MONTHS
6. Moxifloxacin-PAS-Cfx-AMX/CLAV+1 ${ }^{\text {st }}$ line injectable/3 ${ }^{\text {rd }}$ line
- HIV+ patients diagnosed of MD TB should receive TB treatment first and defer ARV BUT be put on cortrimoxazole and fluconazole
TREATMENT FAILURE- OBSERVED WHEN
- Persistent positive cultures and positive smears past 6 months of treatment
- Progressive extensive bilateral lung damage confirmed on X-Ray
- Worsening of patients condition-weight loss/ respiratory insufficiency

EFFECT OF HIV ON TB
- Reactivation of dormant infection
- Rapid progression of new infection to disease
- Recurrence of disease after successful treatment
- Increased risk of other acute infectious illnesses
- Increased risk of death
- Increased risk of adverse reactions to antiTB drugs
EFFECT OF TB ON HIV
- Rapid progression of HIV disease.

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
- BGA-show changes in $\mathrm{Pao}_{2}, \mathrm{Paco}_{2}$, and pH
- Pulse oximetry -decreasing $\mathrm{Sao}_{2}$.
- End tidal $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ monitoring-elevated.

MANAGEMENT
- Oxygen therapy to correct the hypoxemia.
- Chest physical therapy and hydration to mobilize secretions.
- Bronchodilators - reduce bronchospasm
- Steroids to reduce inflammation.
- Diuretics for pulmonary congestion.
- Mechanical ventilation

\section*{RESPIRATORY FAILURE}

Is an alteration in the function of the respiratory system that causes
- the partial pressure of arterial oxygen ( $\mathrm{Pao}_{2}$ ) to fall below 50 mm Hg (hypoxemia)
- the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide ( $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ ) to rise above 50 mm Hg (hypercapnia
May be acute, chronic, or combined

\section*{ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE}
- Characterized by hypoxemia ( $\mathrm{Pao}_{2}$ less than 50 mm Hg ) and/or hypercapnia ( $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ greater than 50 mm Hg ) and acidemia (pH less than 7.35).
- Occurs rapidly, usually in minutes to hours or days.

\section*{CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE}
- Characterized by hypoxemia (decreased $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ ) and/or hypercapnia (increased $\mathrm{PaCo}_{2}$ ) with a normal pH (7.35 to 7.45).
- Occurs over a period of months to year-
1.There is oxygenation Failure i.e. inability to adequately oxygenate the blood often associated with damage to the alveolarcapillary membrane which slows /prevents movement of oxygen from the alveoli to the pulmonary capillary blood
There is severe ventilation-perfusion imbalance
CAUSES
- Cardiogenic pulmonary edema (left ventricular failure; mitral stenosis)
- shock of any etiology
- Trauma e.g fat emboli, head injury, lung contusion
2. Ventilatory Failure with Normal LungsCharacterized by a decrease in $\mathrm{Pao}_{2}$, increase in $\mathrm{Paco}_{2}$, and a decrease in pH
-Primary problem is not the lungs.
CAUSE
-Insufficient respiratory center activity -due to drug intoxication, such as opioid overdose, general anesthesia
- vascular disorders, such as cerebral vascular insufficiency
-brain tumor
-Trauma- head injury
-Insufficient chest wall function (neuromuscular disease, such as Guillain-Barre, myasthenia gravis, trauma to the chest wall resulting in multiple fractures; spinal cord trauma; kyphoscoliosis).
3. Ventilatory Failure with Intrinsic Lung Disease (abnormal lungs)
- Characterized by a decrease in $\mathrm{Pao}_{2}$ and decreased pH due to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ retention as a result of damage to the lung parenchyma and/or airway obstruction

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
- BGA-show changes in $\mathrm{Pao}_{2}, \mathrm{Paco}_{2}$, and pH
- Pulse oximetry -decreasing $\mathrm{Sao}_{2}$.
- End tidal $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ monitoring-elevated.

MANAGEMENT
- Oxygen therapy to correct the hypoxemia.
- Chest physical therapy and hydration to mobilize secretions.
- Bronchodilators - reduce bronchospasm
- Steroids to reduce inflammation.
- Diuretics for pulmonary congestion.
- Mechanical ventilation
