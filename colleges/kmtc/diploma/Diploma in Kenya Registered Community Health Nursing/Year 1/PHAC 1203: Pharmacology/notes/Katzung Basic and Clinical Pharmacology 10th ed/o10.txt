Topical sulfacetamide is available alone as a $10 \%$ lotion (Klaron) and as a $10 \%$ wash (Ovace), and in several preparations in combination with sulfur for the treatment of acne vulgaris and acne rosacea. The mechanism of action is thought to be inhibition of $P$ acnes by competitive inhibition of paminobenzoic acid utilization. Approximately 4\% of topically applied sulfacetamide is absorbed percutaneously, and its use is therefore contraindicated in patients having a known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides.

\section*{ANTI FUNGAL AGENTS}

The treatment of superficial fungal infections caused by dermatophytic fungi may be accomplished (1) with topical antifungal agents, eg, clotrimazole, miconazole, econazole, ketoconazole, oxiconazole, sulconazole, ciclopirox olamine, naftifine, terbinafine, butenafine, and tolnaftate; or (2) with orally administered agents, ie, griseofulvin, terbinafine, ketoconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole. Superficial infections caused by candida species may be treated with topical applications of clotrimazole, miconazole, econazole, ketoconazole, oxiconazole, ciclopirox olamine, nystatin, or amphotericin B. Chronic generalized mucocutaneous candidiasis is responsive to long-term therapy with oral ketoconazole.

\section*{TOPI CAL ANTI FUNGAL PREPARATI ONS}

\section*{Topical Azole Derivatives}

The topical imidazoles, which currently include clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, oxiconazole, and sulconazole, have a wide range of activity against dermatophytes (epidermophyton, microsporum, and trichophyton) and yeasts, including Candida albicans and Pityrosporum orbiculare.

Miconazole (Monistat, Micatin) is available for topical application as a cream or lotion and as vaginal cream or suppositories for use in vulvovaginal candidiasis. Clotrimazole (Lotrimin, Mycelex) is available for topical application to the skin as a cream or lotion and as vaginal cream and tablets for use in vulvovaginal candidiasis. Econazole (Spectazole) is available as a cream for topical application. Oxiconazole (Oxistat) is available as a cream and lotion for topical use. Ketoconazole (Nizoral) is available as a cream for topical treatment of dermatophytosis and candidiasis and as a shampoo for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. Sulconazole (Exelderm) is available as a cream or solution. Topical antifungal-corticosteroid fixed combinations have recently been introduced on the basis of providing more rapid symptomatic improvement than an antifungal agent alone. Clotrimazolebetamethasone dipropionate cream (Lotrisone) is one such combination.

Once- or twice-daily application to the affected area will generally result in clearing of superficial dermatophyte infections in 2-3 weeks, although the medication should be continued until eradication of the organism is confirmed. Paronychial and intertriginous candidiasis can be treated effectively by
any of these agents when applied three or four times daily. Seborrheic dermatitis should be treated with twice-daily applications of ketoconazole until clinical clearing is obtained.

Adverse local reactions to the imidazoles may include stinging, pruritus, erythema, and local irritation. Allergic contact dermatitis appears to be uncommon.

\section*{Ciclopirox Olamine}

Ciclopirox olamine is a synthetic broad-spectrum antimycotic agent with inhibitory activity against dermatophytes, candida species, and P orbiculare. This agent appears to inhibit the uptake of precursors of macromolecular synthesis; the site of action is probably the fungal cell membrane.

Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that $1-2 \%$ of the dose is absorbed when applied as a solution on the back under an occlusive dressing. Ciclopirox olamine is available as a $1 \%$ cream and lotion (Loprox) for the topical treatment of dermatomycosis, candidiasis, and tinea versicolor. The incidence of adverse reactions has been low. Pruritus and worsening of clinical disease have been reported. The potential for delayed allergic contact hypersensitivity appears small.

Topical 8\% ciclopirox olamine (Penlac nail lacquer) has been approved for the treatment of mild to moderate onychomycosis of fingernails and toenails. Although well tolerated with minimal side effects, the overall cure rates in clinical trials are less than $12 \%$.

\section*{Allylamines: Naftifine \& Terbinafine}

Naftifine hydrochloride and terbinafine (Lamisil) are allylamines that are highly active against dermatophytes but less active against yeasts. The antifungal activity derives from selective inhibition of squalene epoxidase, a key enzyme for the synthesis of ergosterol.

They are available as 1\% creams and other forms for the topical treatment of dermatophytosis, to be applied on a twice-daily dosing schedule. Adverse reactions include local irritation, burning sensation, and erythema. Contact with mucous membranes should be avoided.

\section*{Butenafine}

Butenafine hydrochloride (Mentax) is a benzylamine that is structurally related to the allylamines. As with the allylamines, butenafine inhibits the epoxidation of squalene, thus blocking the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membranes. Butenafine is available as a $1 \%$ cream to be applied once daily for the treatment of superficial dermatophytosis.

\section*{Tolnaftate}

Tolnaftate is a synthetic antifungal compound that is effective topically against dermatophyte infections caused by epidermophyton, microsporum, and trichophyton. It is also active against P orbiculare but not against candida.

Tolnaftate (Aftate, Tinactin) is available as a cream, solution, powder, or powder aerosol for application twice daily to infected areas. Recurrences following cessation of therapy are common, and infections of the palms, soles, and nails are usually unresponsive to tolnaftate alone. The powder or powder aerosol may be used chronically following initial treatment in patients susceptible to tinea infections. Tolnaftate is generally well tolerated and rarely causes irritation or allergic contact sensitization.

\section*{Nystatin \& Amphotericin B}

Nystatin and amphotericin B are useful in the topical therapy of C albicans infections but ineffective against dermatophytes. Nystatin is limited to topical treatment of cutaneous and mucosal candida infections because of its narrow spectrum and negligible absorption from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration. Amphotericin B has a broader antifungal spectrum and is used intravenously in the treatment of many systemic mycoses (see Chapter 48) and to a lesser extent in the treatment of cutaneous candida infections.

The recommended dosage for topical preparations of nystatin in treating paronychial and intertriginous candidiasis is application two or three times a day. Oral candidiasis (thrush) is treated by holding 5 mL (infants, 2 mL ) of nystatin oral suspension in the mouth for several minutes four times daily before swallowing. An alternative therapy for thrush is to retain a vaginal tablet in the mouth until dissolved four times daily. Recurrent or recalcitrant perianal, vaginal, vulvar, and diaper area candidiasis may respond to oral nystatin, $0.5-1$ million units in adults ( 100,000 units in children) four times daily in addition to local therapy. Vulvovaginal candidiasis may be treated by insertion of 1 vaginal tablet twice daily for 14 days, then nightly for an additional 14-21 days.

Amphotericin B (Fungizone) is available for topical use in cream and lotion form. The recommended dosage in the treatment of paronychial and intertriginous candidiasis is application two to four times daily to the affected area.

Adverse effects associated with oral administration of nystatin include mild nausea, diarrhea, and occasional vomiting. Topical application is nonirritating, and allergic contact hypersensitivity is exceedingly uncommon. Topical amphotericin B is well tolerated and only occasionally locally irritating. Hypersensitivity is very rare. The drug may cause a temporary yellow staining of the skin, especially when the cream vehicle is used.

\section*{ORAL ANTI FUNGAL AGENTS}

\section*{Oral Azole Derivatives}

Azole derivatives currently available for oral treatment of systemic mycosis include fluconazole (Diflucan), itraconazole (Sporonax), ketoconazole (Nizoral), and others. As discussed in Chapter 48, imidazole derivatives act by affecting the permeability of the cell membrane of sensitive cells through alterations of the biosynthesis of lipids, especially sterols, in the fungal cell.

Ketoconazole was the first imidazole derivative used for oral treatment of systemic mycoses. Patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis respond well to a once-daily dose of 200 mg of ketoconazole, with a median clearing time of 16 weeks. Most patients require long-term maintenance therapy. Variable results have been reported in treatment of chromomycosis.

Ketoconazole has been shown to be quite effective in the therapy of cutaneous infections caused by epidermophyton, microsporum, and trichophyton species. Infections of the glabrous skin often respond within 2-3 weeks to a once-daily oral dose of 200 mg . Palmar-plantar skin is slower to respond, often taking 4-6 weeks at a dosage of 200 mg twice daily. Infections of the hair and nails may take even longer before resolving with low cure rates noted for tinea capitis. Tinea versicolor is very responsive to short courses of a once-daily dose of 200 mg .

Nausea or pruritus has been noted in approximately 3\% of patients taking ketoconazole. More significant side effects include gynecomastia, elevations of hepatic enzyme levels, and hepatitis.

Caution is advised when using ketoconazole in patients with a history of hepatitis. Routine evaluation of hepatic function is advisable for patients on prolonged therapy.

The newer azole derivatives for oral therapy include fluconazole and itraconazole. Fluconazole is well absorbed following oral administration, with a plasma half-life of 30 hours. In view of this long half-life, daily doses of 100 mg are sufficient to treat mucocutaneous candidiasis; alternate-day doses are sufficient for dermatophyte infections. The plasma half-life of itraconazole is similar to fluconazole, with detectable therapeutic concentrations remaining in the stratum corneum for up to 28 days following termination of therapy. Itraconazole has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of onychomycosis in a dosage of 200 mg daily taken with food to ensure maximum absorption for 3 consecutive months. Recent reports of heart failure in patients receiving itraconazole for onychomycosis have resulted in recommendations that it not be given for treatment of onychomycosis in patients with ventricular dysfunction. Additionally, routine evaluation of hepatic function is recommended for patients receiving itraconazole for onychomycosis.

Administration of oral azoles with midazolam or triazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations and may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects of these agents. Administration with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors has been shown to cause a significant risk of rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, administration of the oral azoles with midazolam, triazolam, or HMG-CoA inhibitors is contraindicated.

\section*{Griseofulvin}

Griseofulvin is effective orally against dermatophyte infections caused by epidermophyton, microsporum, and trichophyton. It is ineffective against candida and P orbiculare. Griseofulvin's mechanism of antifungal action is not fully understood, but it is active only against growing cells.

Following the oral administration of 1 g of micronized griseofulvin, drug can be detected in the stratum corneum 4-8 hours later. Reducing the particle size of the medication greatly increases absorption of the drug. Formulations that contain the smallest particle size are labeled "ultramicronized." Ultramicronized griseofulvin achieves bioequivalent plasma levels with half the dose of micronized drug. In addition, solubilizing griseofulvin in polyethylene glycol enhances absorption even further. Micronized griseofulvin is available as 250 mg and 500 mg tablets, and ultramicronized drug is available as 125 mg , 165 mg , 250 mg , and 330 mg tablets and as 250 mg capsules.

The usual adult dosage of the micronized ("microsize") form of the drug is 500 mg daily in single or divided doses with meals; occasionally, $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ is indicated in the treatment of recalcitrant infections. The pediatric dosage is $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight daily in single or divided doses with meals. An oral suspension is available for use in children.

Griseofulvin is most effective in treating tinea infections of the scalp and glabrous (nonhairy) skin. In general, infections of the scalp respond to treatment in 4-6 weeks, and infections of glabrous skin will respond in 3-4 weeks. Dermatophyte infections of the nails respond only to prolonged administration of griseofulvin. Fingernails may respond to 6 months of therapy, whereas toenails are quite recalcitrant to treatment and may require 8-18 months of therapy; relapse almost invariably occurs.

Adverse effects seen with griseofulvin therapy include headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, photosensitivity, peripheral neuritis, and occasionally mental confusion. Griseofulvin is derived from a
penicillium mold, and cross-sensitivity with penicillin may occur. It is contraindicated in patients with porphyria or hepatic failure or those who have had hypersensitivity reactions to it in the past. Its safety in pregnant patients has not been established. Leukopenia and proteinuria have occasionally been reported. Therefore, in patients undergoing prolonged therapy, routine evaluation of the hepatic, renal, and hematopoietic systems is advisable. Coumarin anticoagulant activity may be altered by griseofulvin, and anticoagulant dosage may require adjustment.

\section*{Terbinafine}

Terbinafine (described above) has been shown to be quite effective given orally for the treatment of onychomycosis. Recommended oral dosage is 250 mg daily for 6 weeks for fingernail infections and 12 weeks for toenail infections. Patients receiving terbinafine for onychomycosis should be monitored closely with periodic laboratory evaluations for possible hepatic dysfunction.

\section*{TOPI CAL ANTI VI RAL AGENTS ACYCLOVI R, VALACYCLOVI R, PENCI CLOVI R, \& FAMCI CLOVI R}

Acyclovir, valacyclovir, penciclovir, and famciclovir are synthetic guanine analogs with inhibitory activity against members of the herpesvirus family, including herpes simplex types 1 and 2. Their mechanism of action, indications, and usage in the treatment of cutaneous infections are discussed in Chapter 49.

Topical acyclovir (Zovirax) is available as a $5 \%$ ointment; topical penciclovir (Denavir), as a $1 \%$ cream for the treatment of recurrent orolabial herpes simplex virus infection in immunocompetent adults. Adverse local reactions to acyclovir and penciclovir may include pruritus and mild pain with transient stinging or burning.

\section*{I MMUNOMODULATORS}

\section*{I MI QUI MOD}

Imiquimod (Aldara) is an immunomodulator approved for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts in adults, actinic keratoses on the face and scalp, and biopsy-proven primary basal cell carcinomas on the trunk, neck, and extremities. The mechanism of its action is thought to be related to imiquimod's ability to stimulate peripheral mononuclear cells to release interferon-and to stimulate macrophages to produce interleukins-1, -6, and -8, and tumor necrosis factor-a. (TNF-a).

Imiquimod should be applied to the wart tissue three times per week and left on the skin for 6-10 hours prior to washing off with mild soap and water. Treatment should be continued until eradication of the warts is accomplished, but not for more than a total of 16 weeks. Recommended treatment of actinic keratoses consists of twice-weekly applications on the contiguous area of involvement. The cream is removed after approximately 8 hours with mild soap and water. Treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma consists of five times per week application to the tumor, including a 1 cm margin of surrounding skin, for a 6-week course of therapy.

Percutaneous absorption is minimal, with less than $0.9 \%$ absorbed following a single-dose application. Adverse side effects consist of local inflammatory reactions, including pruritus, erythema, and superficial erosion.

\section*{TACROLI MUS \& PI MECROLI MUS}

Tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) are macrolide immunosuppressants that have been shown to be of significant benefit in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Both agents inhibit Tlymphocyte activation and prevent the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from mast cells in vitro after stimulation by antigen-IgE complexes. Tacrolimus is available as $0.03 \%$ and $0.1 \%$ ointments, and pimecrolimus is available as a 1\% cream. Both are indicated for short-term and intermittent long-term therapy for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. Tacrolimus 0.03\% ointment and pimecrolimus 1\% cream are approved for use in children older than 2 years of age, while all strengths are approved for adult use. Recommended dosing of both agents is twice-daily application to affected skin until clearing is noted. Neither medication should be used with occlusive dressings. The most common side effect of both drugs is a burning sensation in the applied area that improves with continued use. The Food and Drug Administration has added a black box warning to topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus because of animal tumorgenicity data.

\section*{ECTOPARASI TI CI DES PERMETHRI N}

Permethrin is toxic to Pediculus humanus, Pthirus pubis, and Sarcoptes scabiei. Less than $2 \%$ of an applied dose is absorbed percutaneously. Residual drug persists up to 10 days following application.

It is recommended that permethrin 1\% cream rinse (Nix) be applied undiluted to affected areas of pediculosis for 10 minutes and then rinsed off with warm water. For the treatment of scabies, a single application of $5 \%$ cream (Elimite) is applied to the body from the neck down, left on for 8-14 hours, and then washed off. Adverse reactions to permethrin include transient burning, stinging, and pruritus. Cross-sensitization to pyrethrins or chrysanthemums may occur.

\section*{LI NDANE (HEXACHLOROCYCLOHEXANE)}

The gamma isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane was commonly called gamma benzene hexachloride, a misnomer, since no benzene ring is present in this compound. Percutaneous absorption studies using a solution of lindane in acetone have shown that almost 10\% of a dose applied to the forearm is absorbed, to be subsequently excreted in the urine over a 5-day period. After absorption, lindane is concentrated in fatty tissues, including the brain.

Lindane (Kwell, etc) is available as a shampoo or lotion. For pediculosis capitis or pubis, 30 mL of shampoo is applied to dry hair on the scalp or genital area for 4 minutes and then rinsed off. No additional application is indicated unless living lice are present 1 week after treatment. Then reapplication may be required.

Recent concerns about the toxicity of lindane have altered treatment guidelines for its use in scabies; the current recommendation calls for a single application to the entire body from the neck down, left on for 8-12 hours, and then washed off. Patients should be retreated only if active mites can be demonstrated, and never within 1 week of initial treatment.

Concerns about neurotoxicity and hematotoxicity have resulted in warnings that lindane should be used with caution in infants, children, and pregnant women. The current USA package insert recommends that it not be used as a scabicide in premature infants and in patients with known seizure
disorders. California has prohibited the medical use of lindane following evaluation of its toxicologic profile. The risk of adverse systemic reactions to lindane appears to be minimal when it is used properly and according to directions in adult patients. However, local irritation may occur, and contact with the eyes and mucous membranes should be avoided.

\section*{CROTAMITON}

Crotamiton, N-ethyl-o-crotonotoluidide, is a scabicide with some antipruritic properties. Its mechanism of action is not known, and studies on percutaneous absorption have not been published.

Crotamiton (Eurax) is available as a cream or lotion. Suggested guidelines for scabies treatment call for two applications to the entire body from the chin down at 24 -hour intervals, with a cleansing bath 48 hours after the last application. Crotamiton is an effective agent that can be used as an alternative to lindane. Allergic contact hypersensitivity and primary irritation may occur, necessitating discontinuance of therapy. Application to acutely inflamed skin or to the eyes or mucous membranes should be avoided.

\section*{SULFUR}

Sulfur has a long history of use as a scabicide. Although it is nonirritating, it has an unpleasant odor, is staining, and is thus disagreeable to use. It has been replaced by more aesthetic and effective scabicides in recent years, but it remains a possible alternative drug for use in infants and pregnant women. The usual formulation is $5 \%$ precipitated sulfur in petrolatum.

\section*{MALATHI ON}

Malathion is an organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitor that is hydrolyzed by plasma carboxylesterases much faster in humans than in insects, thereby providing a therapeutic advantage in treating pediculosis (see Chapter 7). Malathion is available as a $0.5 \%$ lotion (Ovide) that should be applied to the hair when dry; 4-6 hours later, the hair is combed to remove nits and lice.

\section*{AGENTS AFFECTI NG PIGMENTATI ON HYDROQUI NONE, MONOBENZONE, \& MEQUI NOL}

Hydroquinone, monobenzone (Benoquin, the monobenzyl ether of hydroquinone), and mequinol (the monomethyl ether of hydroquinone) are used to reduce hyperpigmentation of the skin. Topical hydroquinone and mequinol usually result in temporary lightening, whereas monobenzone causes irreversible depigmentation.

The mechanism of action of these compounds appears to involve inhibition of the enzyme tyrosinase, thus interfering with the biosynthesis of melanin. In addition, monobenzone may be toxic to melanocytes, resulting in permanent depigmentation. Some percutaneous absorption of these compounds takes place, because monobenzone may cause hypopigmentation at sites distant from the area of application. Both hydroquinone and monobenzone may cause local irritation. Allergic sensitization to these compounds can occur. Prescription combinations of hydroquinone, fluocinolone acetonide, and retinoic acid (Tri-Luma) and mequinol and retinoic acid (Solagé) are more effective than their individual components.

\section*{TRIOXSALEN \& METHOXSALEN}

Trioxsalen and methoxsalen are psoralens used for the repigmentation of depigmented macules of vitiligo. With the recent development of high-intensity long-wave ultraviolet fluorescent lamps, photochemotherapy with oral methoxsalen for psoriasis and with oral trioxsalen for vitiligo has been under intensive investigation.

Psoralens must be photoactivated by long-wave-length ultraviolet light in the range of $320-400 \mathrm{~nm}$ (UVA) to produce a beneficial effect. Psoralens intercalate with DNA and, with subsequent UVA irradiation, cyclobutane adducts are formed with pyrimidine bases. Both monofunctional and bifunctional adducts may be formed, the latter causing interstrand cross-links. These DNA photoproducts may inhibit DNA synthesis. The major long-term risks of psoralen photochemotherapy are cataracts and skin cancer.

\section*{SUNSCREENS}

Topical medications useful in protecting against sunlight contain either chemical compounds that absorb ultraviolet light, called sunscreens, or opaque materials such as titanium dioxide that reflect light, called sunshades. The three classes of chemical compounds most commonly used in sunscreens are p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and its esters, the benzophenones, and the dibenzoylmethanes.

Most sunscreen preparations are designed to absorb ultraviolet light in the ultraviolet B (UVB) wavelength range from 280 to 320 nm , which is the range responsible for most of the erythema and tanning associated with sun exposure. Chronic exposure to light in this range induces aging of the skin and photocarcinogenesis. Para-aminobenzoic acid and its esters are the most effective available absorbers in the B region.

The benzophenones include oxybenzone, dioxybenzone, and sulisobenzone. These compounds provide a broader spectrum of absorption from 250 to 360 nm , but their effectiveness in the UVB erythema range is less than that of p-aminobenzoic acid. The dibenzoylmethanes include Parasol and Eusolex. These compounds absorb wavelengths throughout the longer ultraviolet A range, 320 nm to 400 nm , with maximum absorption at 360 nm . Patients particularly sensitive to UVA wavelengths include individuals with polymorphous light eruption, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and drug-induced photosensitivity. In these patients, dibenzoylmethane-containing sunscreen may provide improved photoprotection. Although not approved by the FDA at this time, terephthalylidene dicamphorsulfuric acid (Mexoryl) appears to provide greater UVA protection than the dibenzoylmethanes.

The sun protection factor (SPF) of a given sunscreen is a measure of its effectiveness in absorbing erythrogenic ultraviolet light. It is determined by measuring the minimal erythema dose with and without the sunscreen in a group of normal people. The ratio of the minimal erythema dose with sunscreen to the minimal erythema dose without sunscreen is the SPF. Fair-skinned individuals who sunburn easily are advised to use a product with an SPF of 15 or greater.

\section*{ACNE PREPARATIONS RETINOIC ACID \& DERI VATI VES}

Retinoic acid, also known as tretinoin or all-trans-retinoic acid, is the acid form of vitamin A. It is an effective topical treatment for acne vulgaris. Several analogs of vitamin A, eg, 13-cis-retinoic acid
(isotretinoin), have been shown to be effective in various dermatologic diseases when given orally. Vitamin A alcohol is the physiologic form of vitamin A. The topical therapeutic agent, retinoic acid, is formed by the oxidation of the alcohol group, with all four double bonds in the side chain in the trans configuration as shown.
<smiles>CC1=C(/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/[C@@H](C)CC(=O)O)C(C)(C)CCC1</smiles>

Retinoic acid

Retinoic acid is insoluble in water but soluble in many organic solvents. It is susceptible to oxidation, particularly when exposed to light, and ester formation. Topically applied retinoic acid remains chiefly in the epidermis, with less than $10 \%$ absorption into the circulation. The small quantities of retinoic acid absorbed following topical application are metabolized by the liver and excreted in bile and urine.

Retinoic acid has several effects on epithelial tissues. It stabilizes lysosomes, increases ribonucleic acid polymerase activity, increases prostaglandin $\mathrm{E}_{2}$, cAMP, and cGMP levels, and increases the incorporation of thymidine into DNA. Its action in acne has been attributed to decreased cohesion between epidermal cells and increased epidermal cell turnover. This is thought to result in the expulsion of open comedones and the transformation of closed comedones into open ones.

Topical retinoic acid is applied initially in a concentration sufficient to induce slight erythema with mild peeling. The concentration or frequency of application may be decreased if too much irritation occurs. Topical retinoic acid should be applied to dry skin only, and care should be taken to avoid contact with the corners of the nose, eyes, mouth, and mucous membranes. During the first 4-6 weeks of therapy, comedones not previously evident may appear and give the impression that the acne has been aggravated by the retinoic acid. However, with continued therapy, the lesions will clear, and in 8-12 weeks optimal clinical improvement should occur. A timed-release formulation of tretinoin containing microspheres (Retin-A Micro) delivers the medication over time and may be less irritating for sensitive patients.

The effects of tretinoin on keratinization and desquamation offer benefits for patients with photodamaged skin. Prolonged use of tretinoin promotes dermal collagen synthesis, new blood vessel formation, and thickening of the epidermis, which helps diminish fine lines and wrinkles. A specially formulated moisturizing 0.05\% cream (Renova) is marketed for this purpose.

The most common adverse effects of topical retinoic acid are erythema and dryness that occur in the first few weeks of use, but these can be expected to resolve with continued therapy. Animal studies suggest that this drug may increase the tumorigenic potential of ultraviolet radiation. In light of this, patients using retinoic acid should be advised to avoid or minimize sun exposure and use a protective sunscreen. Allergic contact dermatitis to topical retinoic acid is rare.

Adapalene (Differin) is a derivative of naphthoic acid that resembles retinoic acid in structure and effects. It is applied as a $0.1 \%$ gel once daily. Unlike tretinoin, adapalene is photochemically stable and shows little decrease in efficacy when used in combination with benzoyl peroxide. Adapalene is less
irritating than tretinoin and is most effective in patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris.
Tazarotene (Tazorac) is an acetylenic retinoid that is available as a $0.1 \% \mathrm{gel}$ and cream for the treatment of mild to moderately severe facial acne. Topical tazarotene should be used by women of childbearing age only after contraceptive counseling. It is recommended that tazarotene should not be used by pregnant women.

\section*{I SOTRETI NOI N}

Isotretinoin (Accutane) is a synthetic retinoid currently restricted to the treatment of severe cystic acne that is recalcitrant to standard therapies. The precise mechanism of action of isotretinoin in cystic acne is not known, although it appears to act by inhibiting sebaceous gland size and function. The drug is well absorbed, extensively bound to plasma albumin, and has an elimination half-life of 10-20 hours.

Most patients with cystic acne respond to $1-2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, given orally in two divided doses daily for 4-5 months. If severe cystic acne persists following this initial treatment, after a period of 2 months, a second course of therapy may be initiated. Common adverse effects resemble hypervitaminosis A and include dryness and itching of the skin and mucous membranes. Less common side effects are headache, corneal opacities, pseudotumor cerebri, inflammatory bowel disease, anorexia, alopecia, and muscle and joint pains. These effects are all reversible on discontinuance of therapy. Skeletal hyperostosis has been observed in patients receiving isotretinoin with premature closure of epiphyses noted in children treated with this medication. Lipid abnormalities (triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins) are frequent; their clinical relevance is unknown at present.

Teratogenicity is a significant risk in patients taking isotretinoin; therefore, women of childbearing potential must use an effective form of contraception for at least 1 month before, throughout isotretinoin therapy, and for one or more menstrual cycles following discontinuance of treatment. A serum pregnancy test must be obtained within 2 weeks before starting therapy in these patients, and therapy should be initiated only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period. In the USA health care professionals, pharmacists, and patients must utilize a mandatory registration and followup system.

\section*{BENZOYL PEROXI DE}

Benzoyl peroxide is an effective topical agent in the treatment of acne vulgaris. It penetrates the stratum corneum or follicular openings unchanged and is converted metabolically to benzoic acid within the epidermis and dermis. Less than $5 \%$ of an applied dose is absorbed from the skin in an 8 -hour period. It has been postulated that the mechanism of action of benzoyl peroxide in acne is related to its antimicrobial activity against $P$ acnes and to its peeling and comedolytic effects.

To decrease the likelihood of irritation, application should be limited to a low concentration ( $2.5 \%$ ) once daily for the first week of therapy and increased in frequency and strength if the preparation is well tolerated. Fixed-combination formulations of $5 \%$ benzoyl peroxide with $3 \%$ erythromycin base (Benzamycin) or 1\% clindamycin (BenzaClin) appear to be more effective than individual agents alone.

Benzoyl peroxide is a potent contact sensitizer in experimental studies, and this adverse effect may occur in up to $1 \%$ of acne patients. Care should be taken to avoid contact with the eyes and mucous membranes. Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidant and may rarely cause bleaching of the hair or colored fabrics.

\section*{AZELAIC ACID}

Azelaic acid is a straight-chain saturated dicarboxylic acid that has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of acne vulgaris (in the form of Azelex) and acne rosacea (Finacea). Its mechanism of action has not been fully determined, but preliminary studies demonstrate antimicrobial activity against $P$ acnes as well as in vitro inhibitory effects on the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. Initial therapy is begun with once-daily applications of the 20\% cream or 15\% gel to the affected areas for 1 week and twice-daily applications thereafter. Most patients experience mild irritation with redness and dryness of the skin during the first week of treatment. Clinical improvement is noted in 6-8 weeks of continuous therapy.

\section*{DRUGS FOR PSORIASIS}

\section*{ACITRETIN}

Acitretin (Soriatane), a metabolite of the aromatic retinoid etretinate, is quite effective in the treatment of psoriasis, especially pustular forms. It is given orally at a dosage of $25-50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. Adverse effects attributable to acitretin therapy are similar to those seen with isotretinoin and resemble hypervitaminosis A. Elevations in cholesterol and triglycerides may be noted with acitretin, and hepatotoxicity with liver enzyme elevations has been reported. Acitretin is more teratogenic than isotretinoin in the animal species studied to date, which is of special concern in view of the drug's prolonged elimination time (more than 3 months) after chronic administration. In cases where etretinate is formed by concomitant administration of acitretin and ethanol, etretinate may be found in plasma and subcutaneous fat for many years.

Acitretin must not be used by women who are pregnant or may become pregnant while undergoing treatment or at any time for at least 3 years after treatment is discontinued. Ethanol must be strictly avoided during treatment with acitretin and for 2 months after discontinuing therapy. Patients must not donate blood during treatment and for 3 years after acitretin is stopped.

\section*{TAZAROTENE}

Tazarotene (Tazorac) is a topical acetylenic retinoid prodrug that is hydrolyzed to its active form by an esterase. The active metabolite, tazarotenic acid, binds to retinoic acid receptors, resulting in modified gene expression. The precise mechanism of action in psoriasis is unknown but may relate to both antiinflammatory and antiproliferative actions. Tazarotene is absorbed percutaneously, and teratogenic systemic concentrations may be achieved if applied to more than $20 \%$ of total body surface area. Women of childbearing potential must therefore be advised of the risk prior to initiating therapy, and adequate birth control measures must be utilized while on therapy.

Treatment of psoriasis should be limited to once-daily application not to exceed 20\% of total body surface area. Adverse local effects include a burning or stinging sensation (sensory irritation) and peeling, erythema, and localized edema of the skin (irritant dermatitis). Potentiation of photosensitizing medication may occur, and patients should be cautioned to minimize sunlight exposure and to use sunscreens and protective clothing.

\section*{CALCI POTRI ENE}

Calcipotriene (Dovonex) is a synthetic vitamin $D_{3}$ derivative that has been shown to be effective in the
treatment of plaque-type psoriasis vulgaris of moderate severity. Approximately $6 \%$ of the topically applied $0.005 \%$ ointment is absorbed through psoriatic plaques, resulting in a transient elevation of serum calcium in fewer than $1 \%$ of subjects treated in clinical trials. Improvement of psoriasis was generally noted following 2 weeks of therapy, with continued improvement for up to 8 weeks of treatment. However, fewer than $10 \%$ of patients demonstrate total clearing while on calcipotriene as single-agent therapy. Adverse effects include burning, itching, and mild irritation, with dryness and erythema of the treatment area. Care should be taken to avoid facial contact, which may cause ocular irritation.

\section*{BIOLOGIC AGENTS}

Biologic agents useful in treating adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis include the T-cell modulators alefacept and efalizumab, and the TNF-a. inhibitor etanercept.

\section*{Alefacept}

Alefacept (Amevive) is an immunosuppressive dimeric fusion protein that consists of the extracellular CD2-binding portion of the human leukocyte function antigen-3 linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1. Alefacept interferes with lymphocyte activation, which plays a role in the pathophysiology of psoriasis, resulting in a reduction in subsets of CD2 T lymphocytes and circulating total CD4 and CD8 Tlymphocyte counts. The recommended dosage is 7.5 mg given once weekly as an intravenous bolus or 15 mg once weekly as an intramuscular injection for a 12-week course of treatment. Patients should have CD4 lymphocyte counts monitored weekly while taking alefacept, and dosing should be withheld if CD4 counts are below 250 cells/H.L. The drug should be discontinued if the counts remain below 250 cells/H. for 1 month. Alefacept is an immunosuppressive agent and should not be administered to patients with clinically significant infection. Because of the possibility of an increased risk of malignancy, it should not be administered to patients with a history of systemic malignancy.

\section*{Efalizumab}

Efalizumab (Raptiva) is an immunosuppressive recombinant humanized IgG $_{1}$ kappa isotype monoclonal antibody that binds to CD11a subunit of leukocyte function antigen-1. This binding affects the activation, adhesion, and migration of T lymphocytes. The recommended dosage is a single $0.7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ subcutaneous injection conditioning dose followed by weekly subcutaneous injections of $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ not to exceed a maximum single dose of 200 mg . Monitoring of monthly platelet counts is indicated to detect possible severe immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. Efalizumab is an immunosuppressive agent and should not be given concurrently with other immunosuppressive medication.

\section*{Etanercept}

Etanercept (Enbrel) is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand-binding portion of the human TNF receptor linked to the Fc portion of human IgG ${ }_{1}$. Etanercept binds specifically to TNF-a. and $-B$ and blocks interaction with cell surface TNF receptors that play a role in the inflammatory process of plaque psoriasis. The recommended dosage of etanercept is a 50 mg subcutaneous injection given twice weekly for 3 months followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg weekly. Serious life-threatening infections and sepsis have been reported with the use of etanercept, and concurrent use with other immunosuppressive therapy should be avoided.

\section*{ANTI-I NFLAMMATORY AGENTS TOPI CAL CORTI COSTEROI DS}

The remarkable efficacy of topical corticosteroids in the treatment of inflammatory dermatoses was noted soon after the introduction of hydrocortisone in 1952. Since that time, numerous analogs have been developed that offer extensive choices of potencies, concentrations, and vehicles. The therapeutic effectiveness of topical corticosteroids is based primarily on their anti-inflammatory activity. Definitive explanations of the effects of corticosteroids on endogenous mediators of inflammation await further experimental clarification. The antimitotic effects of corticosteroids on human epidermis may account for an additional mechanism of action in psoriasis and other dermatologic diseases associated with increased cell turnover. The general pharmacology of these endocrine agents is discussed in Chapter 39.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

The original topical glucocorticosteroid was hydrocortisone, the natural glucocorticosteroid of the adrenal cortex. The 9 . -fluoro derivative of hydrocortisone was active topically, but its salt-retaining properties made it undesirable even for topical use. Prednisolone and methylprednisolone are as active topically as hydrocortisone (Table 62-1). The 9a-fluorinated steroids dexamethasone and betamethasone did not have any advantage over hydrocortisone. However, triamcinolone and fluocinolone, the acetonide derivatives of the fluorinated steroids, do have a distinct efficacy advantage in topical therapy. Similarly, betamethasone is not very active topically, but attaching a 5-carbon valerate chain to the 17-hydroxyl position results in a compound over 300 times as active as hydrocortisone for topical use. Fluocinonide is the 21-acetate derivative of fluocinolone acetonide; the addition of the 21-acetate enhances the topical activity about fivefold. Fluorination of the steroid is not required for high potency.

\footnotetext{
1 Fluorinated steroids.
Corticosteroids are only minimally absorbed following application to normal skin; for example,
}
approximately $1 \%$ of a dose of hydrocortisone solution applied to the ventral forearm is absorbed. Long-term occlusion with an impermeable film such as plastic wrap is an effective method of enhancing penetration, yielding a tenfold increase in absorption. There is a marked regional anatomic variation in corticosteroid penetration. Compared with the absorption from the forearm, hydrocortisone is absorbed 0.14 times as well through the plantar foot arch, 0.83 times as well through the palm, 3.5 times as well through the scalp, 6 times as well through the forehead, 9 times as well through vulvar skin, and 42 times as well through scrotal skin. Penetration is increased severalfold in the inflamed skin of atopic dermatitis; and in severe exfoliative diseases, such as erythrodermic psoriasis, there appears to be little barrier to penetration.

Experimental studies on the percutaneous absorption of hydrocortisone fail to reveal a significant increase in absorption when applied on a repetitive basis and a single daily application may be effective in most conditions. Ointment bases tend to give better activity to the corticosteroid than do cream or lotion vehicles. Increasing the concentration of a corticosteroid increases the penetration but not to the same degree. For example, approximately $1 \%$ of a $0.25 \%$ hydrocortisone solution is absorbed from the forearm. A tenfold increase in concentration causes only a fourfold increase in absorption. Solubility of the corticosteroid in the vehicle is a significant determinant of the percutaneous absorption of a topical steroid. Marked increases in efficacy are noted when optimized vehicles are used, as demonstrated by newer formulations of betamethasone dipropionate and diflorasone diacetate.

Table 62-1 groups topical corticosteroid formulations according to approximate relative efficacy. Table 62-2 lists major dermatologic diseases in order of their responsiveness to these drugs. In the first group of diseases, low- to medium-efficacy corticosteroid preparations often produce clinical remission. In the second group, it is often necessary to use high-efficacy preparations, occlusion therapy, or both. Once a remission has been achieved, every effort should be made to maintain the improvement with a low-efficacy corticosteroid.

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline Very responsive \\

\end{tabular}

The limited penetration of topical corticosteroids can be overcome in certain clinical circumstances by the intralesional injection of relatively insoluble corticosteroids, eg, triamcinolone acetonide, triamcinolone diacetate, triamcinolone hexacetonide, and betamethasone acetate-phosphate. When these agents are injected into the lesion, measurable amounts remain in place and are gradually released for 3-4 weeks. This form of therapy is often effective for the lesions listed in Table 62-2 that are generally unresponsive to topical corticosteroids. The dosage of the triamcinolone salts should be limited to 1 mg per treatment site, ie, 0.1 mL of $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}$ suspension, to decrease the incidence of local atrophy (see below).

\section*{Adverse Effects}

All absorbable topical corticosteroids possess the potential to suppress the pituitary-adrenal axis (see Chapter 39). Although most patients with pituitary-adrenal axis suppression demonstrate only a laboratory test abnormality, cases of severely impaired stress response can occur. Iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome may occur as a result of protracted use of topical corticosteroids in large quantities. Applying potent corticosteroids to extensive areas of the body for prolonged periods, with or without occlusion, increases the likelihood of systemic effects. Fewer of these factors are required to produce adverse systemic effects in children, and growth retardation is of particular concern in the pediatric age group.

Adverse local effects of topical corticosteroids include the following: atrophy, which may present as depressed, shiny, often wrinkled "cigarette paper"-appearing skin with prominent telangiectases and a tendency to develop purpura and ecchymosis; steroid rosacea, with persistent erythema, telangiectatic vessels, pustules, and papules in central facial distribution; perioral dermatitis, steroid acne, alterations of cutaneous infections, hypopigmentation, hypertrichosis; increased intraocular pressure; and allergic contact dermatitis. The latter may be confirmed by patch testing with high concentrations of corticosteroids, ie, $1 \%$ in petrolatum, because topical corticosteroids are not irritating. Screening for allergic contact dermatitis potential is performed with tixocortol pivalate, budesonide, and hydrocortisone valerate or butyrate. Topical corticosteroids are contraindicated in individuals who demonstrate hypersensitivity to them. Some sensitized subjects develop a generalized flare when dosed with adrenocorticotropic hormone or oral prednisone.

\section*{TAR COMPOUNDS}

Tar preparations are used mainly in the treatment of psoriasis, dermatitis, and lichen simplex chronicus. The phenolic constituents endow these compounds with antipruritic properties, making them particularly valuable in the treatment of chronic lichenified dermatitis. Acute dermatitis with vesiculation and oozing may be irritated by even weak tar preparations, which should be avoided. However, in the subacute and chronic stages of dermatitis and psoriasis, these preparations are quite useful and offer an alternative to the use of topical corticosteroids.

The most common adverse reaction to coal tar compounds is an irritant folliculitis, necessitating discontinuance of therapy to the affected areas for a period of 3-5 days. Phototoxicity and allergic contact dermatitis may also occur. Tar preparations should be avoided in patients who have previously exhibited sensitivity to them.

\section*{KERATOLYTI C \& DESTRUCTI VE AGENTS}

\section*{SALI CYLIC ACID}

Salicylic acid has been extensively used in dermatologic therapy as a keratolytic agent. The mechanism by which it produces its keratolytic and other therapeutic effects is poorly understood. The drug may solubilize cell surface proteins that keep the stratum corneum intact, thereby resulting in desquamation of keratotic debris. Salicylic acid is keratolytic in concentrations of 3-6\%. In concentrations greater than $6 \%$, it can be destructive to tissues.
<smiles>O=C(O)c1ccccc1O</smiles>

Salicylic acid

Salicylism and death have occurred following topical application. In an adult, 1 g of a topically applied $6 \%$ salicylic acid preparation will raise the serum salicylate level not more than $0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ of plasma; the threshold for toxicity is $30-50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Higher serum levels are possible in children, who are therefore at a greater risk to develop salicylism. In cases of severe intoxication, hemodialysis is the treatment of choice (see Chapter 59). It is advisable to limit both the total amount of salicylic acid applied and the frequency of application. Urticarial, anaphylactic, and erythema multiforme reactions may occur in patients who are allergic to salicylates. Topical use may be associated with local irritation, acute inflammation, and even ulceration with the use of high concentrations of salicylic acid. Particular care must be exercised when using the drug on the extremities of diabetics or patients with peripheral vascular disease.

\section*{PROPYLENE GLYCOL}

Propylene glycol is used extensively in topical preparations because it is an excellent vehicle for organic compounds. It has recently been used alone as a keratolytic agent in 40-70\% concentrations, with plastic occlusion, or in gel with $6 \%$ salicylic acid.

Only minimal amounts of a topically applied dose are absorbed through normal stratum corneum. Percutaneously absorbed propylene glycol is oxidized by the liver to lactic acid and pyruvic acid, with subsequent utilization in general body metabolism. Approximately $12-45 \%$ of the absorbed agent is excreted unchanged in the urine.

Propylene glycol is an effective keratolytic agent for the removal of hyperkeratotic debris. It is also an effective humectant and increases the water content of the stratum corneum. The hygroscopic characteristics of propylene glycol may help it to develop an osmotic gradient through the stratum corneum, thereby increasing hydration of the outermost layers by drawing water out from the inner layers of the skin.

Propylene glycol is used under polyethylene occlusion or with $6 \%$ salicylic acid for the treatment of ichthyosis, palmar and plantar keratodermas, psoriasis, pityriasis rubra pilaris, keratosis pilaris, and hypertrophic lichen planus.

In concentrations greater than $10 \%$, propylene glycol may act as an irritant in some patients; those with eczematous dermatitis may be more sensitive. Allergic contact dermatitis occurs with propylene glycol, and a $4 \%$ aqueous propylene glycol solution is recommended for the purpose of patch testing.

\section*{UREA}

Urea in a compatible cream vehicle or ointment base has a softening and moisturizing effect on the stratum corneum. It has the ability to make creams and lotions feel less greasy, and this has been utilized in dermatologic preparations to decrease the oily feel of a preparation that otherwise might feel unpleasant. It is a white crystalline powder with a slight ammonia odor when moist.

Urea is absorbed percutaneously, although the precise amount absorbed is not well documented. It is distributed predominantly in the extracellular space and excreted in urine. Urea is a natural product of metabolism, and systemic toxicities with topical application do not occur.

Urea allegedly increases the water content of the stratum corneum, presumably as a result of the hygroscopic characteristics of this naturally occurring molecule. Urea is also keratolytic. The mechanism of action appears to involve alterations in prekeratin and keratin, leading to increased solubilization. In addition, urea may break hydrogen bonds that keep the stratum corneum intact.

As a humectant, urea is used in concentrations of 2-20\% in creams and lotions. As a keratolytic agent, it is used in 20\% concentration in diseases such as ichthyosis vulgaris, hyperkeratosis of palms and soles, xerosis, and keratosis pilaris. Concentrations of $30-50 \%$ applied to the nail plate have been useful in softening the nail prior to avulsion.

\section*{PODOPHYLLUM RESIN \& PODOFI LOX}

Podophyllum resin, an alcoholic extract of Podophyllum peltatum, commonly known as mandrake root or May apple, is used in the treatment of condyloma acuminatum and other verrucae. It is a mixture of podophyllotoxin, and Bpeltatin, desoxypodophyllotoxin, dehydropodophyllotoxin, and other compounds. It is soluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform, and compound tincture of benzoin.

Percutaneous absorption of podophyllum resin occurs, particularly in intertriginous areas and from applications to large moist condylomas. It is soluble in lipids and therefore is distributed widely throughout the body, including the central nervous system.

The major use of podophyllum resin is in the treatment of condyloma acuminatum. Podophyllotoxin and its derivatives are active cytotoxic agents with specific affinity for the microtubule protein of the mitotic spindle. Normal assembly of the spindle is prevented, and epidermal mitoses are arrested in metaphase. A $25 \%$ concentration of podophyllum resin in compound tincture of benzoin is recommended for the treatment of condyloma acuminatum. Application should be restricted to wart tissue only, to limit the total amount of medication used and to prevent severe erosive changes in adjacent tissue. In treating cases of large condylomas, it is advisable to limit application to sections of the affected area to minimize systemic absorption. The patient is instructed to wash off the preparation 2-3 hours after the initial application, because the irritant reaction is variable. Depending on the individual patient's reaction, this period can be extended to $6-8$ hours on subsequent applications. If three to five applications have not resulted in significant resolution, other methods of treatment should be considered.

Toxic symptoms associated with excessively large applications include nausea, vomiting, alterations in sensorium, muscle weakness, neuropathy with diminished tendon reflexes, coma, and even death. Local irritation is common, and inadvertent contact with the eye may cause severe conjunctivitis. Use during pregnancy is contraindicated in view of possible cytotoxic effects on the fetus.

Pure podophyllotoxin (podofilox) is approved for use as a $0.5 \%$ podophyllotoxin preparation (Condylox) for application by the patient in the treatment of genital condylomas. The low concentration of podofilox significantly reduces the potential for systemic toxicity. Most men with penile warts may be treated with less than $70 \mu \mathrm{~L}$ per application. At this dose, podofilox is not routinely detected in the serum. Treatment is self administered in treatment cycles of twice-daily application for 3 consecutive
days followed by a 4-day drug-free period. Local adverse effects include inflammation, erosions, burning pain, and itching.

\section*{FLUOROURACIL}

Fluorouracil is a fluorinated pyrimidine antimetabolite that resembles uracil, with a fluorine atom substituted for the 5-methyl group. Its systemic pharmacology is described in Chapter 55. Fluorouracil is used topically for the treatment of multiple actinic keratoses.

Approximately 6\% of a topically applied dose is absorbed-an amount insufficient to produce adverse systemic effects. Most of the absorbed drug is metabolized and excreted as carbon dioxide, urea, and a-fluoro- $B$-alanine. A small percentage is eliminated unchanged in the urine. Fluorouracil inhibits thymidylate synthetase activity, interfering with the synthesis of DNA and, to a lesser extent, RNA. These effects are most marked in atypical, rapidly proliferating cells.

Fluorouracil is available in multiple formulations containing $0.5 \%, 1 \%, 2 \%$, and $5 \%$ concentrations. The response to treatment begins with erythema and progresses through vesiculation, erosion, superficial ulceration, necrosis, and finally reepithelialization. Fluorouracil should be continued until the inflammatory reaction reaches the stage of ulceration and necrosis, usually in 3-4 weeks, at which time treatment should be terminated. The healing process may continue for 1-2 months after therapy is discontinued. Local adverse reactions may include pain, pruritus, a burning sensation, tenderness, and residual postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Excessive exposure to sunlight during treatment may increase the intensity of the reaction and should be avoided. Allergic contact dermatitis to fluorouracil has been reported, and its use is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity.

\section*{NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-I NFLAMMATORY DRUGS}

A topical 3\% gel formulation of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (Solaraze) has shown moderate effectiveness in the treatment of actinic keratoses. The mechanism of action is unknown. As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur with diclofenac, and it should be given with caution to patients with known aspirin hypersensitivity (see Chapter 36).

\section*{AMI NOLEVULI NIC ACID}

Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is an endogenous precursor of photosensitizing porphyrin metabolites. When exogenous ALA is provided to the cell through topical applications, protoporphyrin IX (PplX) accumulates in the cell. When exposed to light of appropriate wavelength and energy, the accumulated PplX produces a photodynamic reaction resulting in the formation of cytotoxic superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. Photosensitization of actinic keratoses using ALA (Levulan Kerastick) and illumination with a blue light photodynamic therapy illuminator (BLU-U) is the basis for ALA photodynamic therapy.

Treatment consists of applying ALA 20\% topical solution to individual actinic keratoses followed by blue light photodynamic illumination 14-18 hours later. Transient stinging or burning at the treatment site occurs during the period of light exposure. Patients must avoid exposure to sunlight or bright indoor lights for at least 40 hours after ALA application. Redness, swelling, and crusting of the actinic keratoses will occur and gradually resolve over a 3 - to 4 -week time course.

\section*{ANTI PRURITIC AGENTS DOXEPIN}

Topical doxepin hydrochloride 5\% cream (Zonalon) may provide significant antipruritic activity when utilized in the treatment of pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis or lichen simplex chronicus. The precise mechanism of action is unknown but may relate to the potent $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ - and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-receptor antagonist properties of dibenzoxepin tricyclic compounds. Percutaneous absorption is variable and may result in significant drowsiness in some patients. In view of the anticholinergic effect of doxepin, topical use is contraindicated in patients with untreated narrow-angle glaucoma or a tendency to urinary retention.

Plasma levels of doxepin similar to those achieved during oral therapy may be obtained with topical application; the usual drug interactions associated with tricyclic antidepressants may occur. Therefore, monoamine oxidase inhibitors must be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to the initiation of doxepin cream. Topical application of the cream should be performed four times daily for up to 8 days of therapy. The safety and efficacy of chronic dosing has not been established. Adverse local effects include marked burning and stinging of the treatment site which may necessitate discontinuation of the cream in some patients. Allergic contact dermatitis appears to be frequent, and patients should be monitored for symptoms of hypersensitivity.

\section*{PRAMOXI NE}

Pramoxine hydrochloride is a topical anesthetic that can provide temporary relief from pruritus associated with mild eczematous dermatoses. Pramoxine is available as a $1 \%$ cream, lotion, or gel and in combination with hydrocortisone acetate. Application to the affected area two to four times daily may provide short-term relief of pruritus. Local adverse effects include transient burning and stinging. Care should be exercised to avoid contact with the eyes.

\section*{TRI CHOGENI C \& ANTITRI CHOGENI C AGENTS MINOXI DIL}

Topical minoxidil (Rogaine) is effective in reversing the progressive miniaturization of terminal scalp hairs associated with androgenic alopecia. Vertex balding is more responsive to therapy than frontal balding. The mechanism of action of minoxidil on hair follicles is unknown. Chronic dosing studies have demonstrated that the effect of minoxidil is not permanent, and cessation of treatment will lead to hair loss in 4-6 months. Percutaneous absorption of minoxidil in normal scalp is minimal, but possible systemic effects on blood pressure (see Chapter 11) should be monitored in patients with cardiac disease.

\section*{FINASTERIDE}

Finasteride (Propecia) is a 5a-reductase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (see Chapter 40), the androgen responsible for androgenic alopecia in genetically predisposed men. Oral finasteride, $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, promotes hair growth and prevents further hair loss in a significant proportion of men with androgenic alopecia. Treatment for at least 3-6 months is necessary to see increased hair growth or prevent further hair loss. Continued treatment with finasteride is necessary to sustain benefit. Reported (and predictable) adverse effects include decreased libido, ejaculation disorders, and erectile dysfunction, which resolve in most men who remain on therapy and
in all men who discontinue finasteride.
There are no data to support the use of finasteride in women with androgenic alopecia. Pregnant women should not be exposed to finasteride either by use or by handling crushed tablets because of the risk of hypospadias developing in a male fetus.

\section*{EFLORNITHINE}

Eflornithine (Vaniqa) is an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase that catalyzes the ratelimiting step in the biosynthesis of polyamines. Polyamines are required for cell division and differentiation, and inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase affects the rate of hair growth. Eflornithine has been shown to be effective in reducing facial hair growth in approximately $30 \%$ of women when applied twice daily for 6 months of therapy. Hair growth was observed to return to pretreatment levels 8 weeks after discontinuation. Local adverse effects include stinging, burning, and folliculitis.

\section*{ANTI NEOPLASTI C AGENTS}

Alitretinoin (Panretin) is a topical formulation of 9-cis-retinoic acid which is approved for the treatment of cutaneous lesions in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Localized reactions may include intense erythema, edema, and vesiculation necessitating discontinuation of therapy. Patients who are applying alitretinoin should not concurrently use products containing deet, a common component of insect repellant products.

Bexarotene (Targretin) is a member of a subclass of retinoids that selectively binds and activates retinoid $X$ receptor subtypes. It is available both in an oral formulation and as a topical gel for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Teratogenicity is a significant risk for both systemic and topical treatment with bexarotene, and women of childbearing potential must avoid becoming pregnant throughout therapy and for at least 1 month following discontinuation of the drug.

\section*{ANTI SEBORRHEA AGENTS}

Table 62-3 lists topical formulations for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. These are of variable efficacy and may necessitate concomitant treatment with topical corticosteroids for severe cases.

\section*{DRUGS USED I N THE TREATMENT OF GASTROI NTESTI NAL DI SEASES: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Many of the drug groups discussed elsewhere in this book have important applications in the treatment of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and other organs. Other groups are used almost exclusively for their effect on the gut; these are discussed below according to their therapeutic uses.

\section*{DRUGS USED IN ACID-PEPTIC DISEASES}

Acid- peptic diseases include gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer (gastric and duodenal), and stress-related mucosal injury. In all these conditions, mucosal erosions or ulceration arise when the caustic effects of aggressive factors (acid, pepsin, bile) overwhelm the defensive factors of the gastrointestinal mucosa (mucus and bicarbonate secretion, prostaglandins, blood flow, and the processes of restitution and regeneration after cellular injury). Over $99 \%$ of peptic ulcers are caused by infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori or by use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Drugs used in the treatment of acid-peptic disorders ma be divided into two classes: agents that reduce intragastric acidity and agents that promote mucosal defense.

\section*{Agents that Reduce I ntragastric Acidity PHYSIOLOGY OF ACID SECRETION}

The parietal cell contains receptors for gastrin, histamine ( $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ ), and acetylcholine (muscarinic, $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ ) (Figure 63-1). When acetylcholine or gastrin bind to the parietal cell receptors, they cause an increase in cytosolic calcium, which in turn stimulates protein kinases that stimulate acid secretion from a $\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase (the protor pump) on the canalicular surface.

Schematic diagram of one model of the physiologic control of hydrogen ion secretion by the gastric parietal cell. ECL cell, enterochromaffin-like cell; G(CCK-B), gastrin-cholecystokinin-B receptor; H, histamine; $\mathrm{H}_{2}$, histamine $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor; $\mathrm{M}_{1}$, $\mathrm{M}_{3}$, muscarinic receptors; $\mathrm{ST}_{2}$, somatostatin-2 receptor; ATPase, $\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase proton pump. Some investigators place histamine receptors-and possibly cholinoceptors-on nearby tissue cells rather than on the parietal cell itself.
(Modified and redrawn from Sachs G, Prinz C: Gastric enterochromaffin-like cells and the regulation of acid secretion. News Physiol Sci 1996; 11:57, and other sources.)

In close proximity to the parietal cells are gut endocrine cells called enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. ECL cells have receptors for gastrin and acetylcholine and are the major source for histamine release. Histamine binds to the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor on the parietal cell, resulting in activation of adenylyl cyclase, which increases intracellular cycli adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP activates protein kinases that stimulate acid secretion by the $\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ ATPase. In humans, it is believed that the major effect of gastrin upon acid secretion is mediated indirectly through the release of histamine from ECL cells rather than through direct parietal cell stimulation.

\section*{ANTACIDS}

Antacids have been used for centuries in the treatment of patients with dyspepsia and acid-peptic disorders. They were the mainstay of treatment for acid-peptic disorders until the advent of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors. They continue to be used commonly by patients as nonprescription remedies for the treatment of intermittent heartburn and dyspepsia.

Antacids are weak bases that react with gastric hydrochloric acid to form a salt and water. Although their principal mechanism of action is reduction of intragastric acidity, they may also promote mucosal defense mechanisms through stimulation of mucosal prostaglandin production. After a meal, approximately $45 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{h}$ o.
hydrochloric acid is secreted. A single dose of 156 mEq of antacid given 1 hour after a meal effectively neutralizes gastric acid for up to 2 hours. However, the acid-neutralization capacity among different proprietary formulations of antacids is highly variable, depending on their rate of dissolution (tablet versus liquid), water solubility, rate of reaction with acid, and the rate of gastric emptying.

Sodium bicarbonate (eg, baking soda, Alka Seltzer) reacts rapidly with HCl to produce carbon dioxide and NaCl . Formation of carbon dioxide results in gastric distention and belching. Unreacted alkali is readily absorbec potentially causing metabolic alkalosis when given in high doses or to patients with renal insufficiency. Sodium chloride absorption may exacerbate fluid retention in patients with heart failure, hypertension, and renal insufficiency.

Calcium carbonate (eg, Tums, Os-Cal) is less soluble and reacts more slowly than sodium bicarbonate with Ht to form carbon dioxide and $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$. Like sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate may cause belching or metaboli alkalosis. Calcium carbonate is used for a number of other indications apart from its antacid properties (see Chapter 42). Excessive doses of either sodium bicarbonate or calcium carbonate with calcium-containing dairy products can lead to hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, and metabolic alkalosis (milk-alkali syndrome).

Formulations containing magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide react slowly with HCl to form magnesium chloride or aluminum chloride and water. Because no gas is generated, belching does not occur. Metabolic alkalosis is also uncommon because of the efficiency of the neutralization reaction. Because unabsorbed magnesium salts may cause an osmotic diarrhea and aluminum salts may cause constipation, thes agents are commonly administered together in proprietary formulations (eg, Gelusil, Maalox, Mylanta) to minimize the impact upon bowel function. Both magnesium and aluminum are absorbed and excreted by the kidneys. Hence, patients with renal insufficiency should not take these agents long-term.

All antacids may affect the absorption of other medications by binding the drug (reducing its absorption) or by increasing intragastric pH so that the drug's dissolution or solubility (especially weakly basic or acidic drugs) is altered. Therefore, antacids should not be given within 2 hours of doses of tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, itraconazole, and iron.

\section*{$\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{2}}$-RECEPTOR ANTAGONI STS}

From their introduction in the 1970s until the early 1990s, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-receptor antagonists (commonly referred to as H blockers) were the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world (see Clinical Uses). With the recognition of the role of H pylori in ulcer disease (which may be treated with appropriate antibacterial therapy) and the advent of proton pump inhibitors, the use of prescription $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ blockers has declined markedly.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Four $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists are in clinical use: cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine (Figure 63-2). All four agents are rapidly absorbed from the intestine. Cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine undergo first-pass hepatic metabolism resulting in a bioavailability of approximately $50 \%$. Nizatidine has little first-pass metabolisr and a bioavailability of almost $100 \%$. The serum half-lives of the four agents range from 1.1-4 hours; however, duration of action depends on the dose given (Table 63-1). $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists are cleared by a combination of hepatic metabolism, glomerular filtration, and renal tubular secretion. Dose reduction is required in patients wit moderate to severe renal (and possibly severe hepatic) insufficiency. In the elderly, there is a decline of up to $50 \%$ in drug clearance as well as a significant reduction in volume of distribution.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

The $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists exhibit competitive inhibition at the parietal cell $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor and suppress basal and mealstimulated acid secretion in a linear, dose-dependent manner (Figure 63-3). They are highly selective and do $n$ affect $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ or $\mathrm{H}_{3}$ receptors. The volume of gastric secretion and the concentration of pepsin are also reduced.
Figure 63-3.

Twenty-four hour median intragastric acidity pretreatment (black) and after 1 month of treatment with either ranitidine, 150 mg twice daily (light color, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ block), or omeprazole, 20 mg once daily (dark color, PPI). Note that $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-receptor antagonists have a marked effect upon nocturnal acid secretion but only a modest effect upon meal-stimulated secretion. Proton pump inhibitors markedly suppress meal-stimulated and nocturnal acid secretion.
(Redrawn from data in Lanzon-Miller S et al: Twenty-four-hour intragastric acidity and plasma gastrin concentration before and during treatment with either ranitidine or omeprazole. Aliment Pharmacol Ther 1987; 1:239.)
$\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists reduce acid secretion stimulated by histamine as well as by gastrin and cholinomimetic agents through two mechanisms. First, histamine released from ECL cells by gastrin or vagal stimulation is blocked frol binding to the parietal cell $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor. Second, direct stimulation of the parietal cell by gastrin or acetylcholine results in diminished acid secretion in the presence of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-receptor blockade. It appears that reduced parietal cell cAMP levels attenuate the intracellular activation of protein kinases by gastrin or acetylcholine.

The potencies of the four $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-receptor antagonists vary over a 50-fold range (Table 63-1). When given in usual prescription doses however, all of the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists inhibit 60-70\% of total 24-hour acid secretion. $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists are especially effective at inhibiting nocturnal acid secretion (which depends largely on histamine) but have a modest impact on meal-stimulated acid secretion (which is stimulated by gastrin and acetylcholine a well as histamine). Thus, they block more than $90 \%$ of nocturnal acid but only $60-80 \%$ of daytime acid secretion. Therefore, nocturnal and fasting intragastric pH is raised to $4-5$ but the impact upon the daytime, meal-stimulated pH profile is less. Recommended prescription doses maintain greater than $50 \%$ acid inhibition for 10 hours; hence, these drugs are commonly given twice daily. At doses available in over-the-counter
formulations, the duration of acid inhibition is less than 6 hours.

\section*{Clinical Uses}
$\mathrm{H}_{2}$-receptor antagonists continue to be prescribed commonly. However, due to their superior acid inhibition an safety profile, proton pump inhibitors (see below) are steadily replacing $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists for most clinical indications.

\section*{GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD)}

Patients with infrequent heartburn or dyspepsia (fewer than 3 times per week) may take either antacids or intermittent $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists. Because antacids provide rapid acid neutralization, they afford faster symptom reli than $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists. However, the effect of antacids is short-lived ( $1-2$ hours) compared with $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists (6-10 hours). $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists may be taken prophylactically before meals in an effort to reduce the likelihood of heartburn. Frequent heartburn is better treated with twice-daily $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists; this regimen provides effective symptom control in 50-75\% of people (Table 63-1). In patients with erosive esophagitis (approximately half of patients with GERD), $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists afford healing in less than $50 \%$ of patients. Although higher doses of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists increase healing rates, proton pump inhibitors are preferred.

\section*{PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE}

Proton pump inhibitors have largely replaced $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Nocturnal acid suppression by either drug group affords effective ulcer healing in the majority of patients with uncomplicated gastric and duodenal ulcers. Hence, all the agents may be administered once daily at bedtime fc acute, uncomplicated ulcers, resulting in ulcer healing rates greater than 80-90\% after 6-8 weeks of therapy. For patients with acute peptic ulcers caused by H pylori, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists no longer play a significant therapeutic role. For the minority of patients in whom H pylori cannot be successfully eradicated, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists may be given daily at bedtime in half of the usual ulcer therapeutic dose to prevent ulcer recurrence (eg, ranitidine, 151 mg ; famotidine, 20 mg ). For patients with ulcers caused by aspirin or other NSAIDs, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists provide rapid ulcer healing so long as the NSAID is discontinued. If the NSAID must be continued for clinical reasons despite active ulceration, a proton pump inhibitor should be given to promote ulcer healing.

\section*{NONULCER DYSPEPSIA}
$\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists are commonly used as over-the-counter agents and prescription agents for treatment of intermittent dyspepsia not caused by peptic ulcer. However, benefit compared with placebo has never been convincingly demonstrated.

\section*{PREVENTION OF BLEEDING FROM STRESS-RELATED GASTRITIS}
$\mathrm{H}_{2}$-receptor antagonists significantly reduce the incidence of bleeding from stress-related gastritis in seriously i patients in the intensive care unit. $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists are given intravenously, either as intermittent injections or continuous infusions. For maximal efficacy, the pH of gastric aspirates should be measured and the doses titrated to achieve a gastric pH higher than 4.

\section*{Adverse Effects}
$\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists are extremely safe drugs. Adverse effects occur in fewer than $3 \%$ of patients and include diarrhea, headache, fatigue, myalgias, and constipation.

\section*{CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM}

Mental status changes (confusion, hallucinations, agitation) may occur with administration of intravenous $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists, especially in patients in the intensive care unit who are elderly or who have renal or hepatic
dysfunction. These events may be more common with cimetidine. Mental status changes rarely occur in ambulatory patients.

\section*{ENDOCRINE EFFECTS}

Cimetidine inhibits binding of dihydrotestosterone to androgen receptors, inhibits metabolism of estradiol, and increases serum prolactin levels. When used long-term or in high doses, it may cause gynecomastia or impotence in men and galactorrhea in women. These effects are specific to cimetidine and do not occur with thr other $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists.

\section*{PREGNANCY AND NURSING MOTHERS}

Although there are no known harmful effects on the fetus, these agents cross the placenta. Therefore, they should not be administered to pregnant women unless absolutely necessary. The $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists are secreted into breast milk and may therefore affect nursing infants.

\section*{OTHER EFFECTS}
$\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists may rarely cause blood dyscrasias. Blockade of cardiac $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptors may cause bradycardia but this is rarely of clinical significance. Rapid intravenous infusion may cause bradycardia and hypotension through blockade of cardiac $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptors; therefore, intravenous injection should be given over 30 minutes. $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists rarely cause reversible abnormalities in liver chemistry.

\section*{Drug I nteractions}

Cimetidine interferes with several important hepatic cytochrome P450 drug metabolism pathways, including those catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 (see Chapter 4). Hence, the half-lives of drugs metabolized by these pathways may be prolonged. Ranitidine binds 4-10 times less avidly than cimetidine to cytochrome P450. Negligible interaction occurs with nizatidine and famotidine.
$\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists compete with certain drugs (eg, procainamide) for renal tubular secretion. All of these agents except famotidine inhibit gastric first-pass metabolism of ethanol, especially in women. Although the importanc of this is debated, increased bioavailability of ethanol could lead to increased blood ethanol levels.

\section*{PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (PPI)}

Since their introduction in the late 1980s, these efficacious acid inhibitory agents have rapidly assumed the major role for the treatment of acid-peptic disorders. They are now among the most widely selling drugs worldwide due to their outstanding efficacy and safety.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Five proton pump inhibitors are available for clinical use: omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole. All are substituted benzimidazoles that resemble $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists in structure (Figure 63-4) but have a completely different mechanism of action. Omeprazole is a racemic mixture R - and S -isomers. Esomeprazole is the S -isomer of omeprazole. All are available in oral formulations. Esomeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole are also available in intravenous formulations (Table 63-2).

Proton pump inhibitors are administered as inactive prodrugs. To protect the acid-labile prodrug from rapid destruction within the gastric lumen, oral products are formulated for delayed release as acid-resistant, entericcoated capsule or tablet formulations. After passing through the stomach into the alkaline intestinal lumen, the enteric coatings dissolve and the prodrug is absorbed. For children or patients with dysphagia or enteral feedin! tubes, capsules may be opened and the microgranules mixed with apple or orange juice or mixed with soft fooc (eg, applesauce). Lansoprazole is also available as a tablet formulation that disintegrates in the mouth or may 1 mixed with water and administered via oral syringe or enteral tube. Omeprazole is also available as a non-enteric-coated powder that contains sodium bicarbonate ( $1680 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{NaHCO}_{3} ; 460 \mathrm{mg}$ of sodium) to protect the naked (nonenteric coated) drug from acid degradation. When mixed with water and administered on an empty stomach by mouth or enteral tube, this "immediate-release" suspension results in rapid omeprazole absorption
( $T_{\max }<30$ minutes) and onset of acid inhibition.
The proton pump inhibitors are lipophilic weak bases ( $p K_{a} 4-5$ ) and after intestinal absorption diffuse readily across lipid membranes into acidified compartments (such as the parietal cell canaliculus). Within the acidified compartment the prodrug rapidly becomes protonated and is concentrated more than 1000-fold within the parietal cell canaliculus by Henderson-Hasselbalch trapping (see Chapter 1). There, it rapidly undergoes a molecular conversion to the active, reactive thiophilic sulfonamide cation. The sulfonamide reacts with the $\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{k}$ ATPase, forms a covalent disulfide linkage, and irreversibly inactivates the enzyme. The rate of conversion is inversely proportional to the $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}$ of the drug.

The pharmacokinetics of available proton pump inhibitors are shown in Table 63-2. Rabeprazole (due to its higher $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}$ ) or immediate-release omeprazole (due to its rapid release and absorption) may have a slightly faster onset of acid inhibition than other oral formulations. Although differences in pharmacokinetic profiles mas affect speed of onset and duration of acid inhibition in the first few days of therapy, they are of little clinical importance with continued daily administration. The bioavailability of all agents is decreased approximately $50 \%$ by food; hence, the drugs should be administered on an empty stomach. In a fasting state, only $10 \%$ of proton pumps are actively secreting acid and susceptible to inhibition. Proton pump inhibitors should be administered approximately 1 hour before a meal (usually breakfast or dinner), so that the peak serum concentration coincides with the maximal activity of proton pump secretion. The drugs have a short serum half-life of about 1 hours; however, the duration of acid inhibition lasts up to 24 hours due to the irreversible inactivation of the proton pump. At least 18 hours are required for synthesis of new $\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump molecules. Because not all proton pumps are inactivated with the first dose of medication, up to 3-4 days of daily medication are required before the full acid-inhibiting potential is reached. Similarly, after stopping the drug, it takes 3-4 days for full acid secretion to return.

Proton pump inhibitors undergo rapid first-pass and systemic hepatic metabolism and have negligible renal clearance. Dose reduction is not needed for patients with renal insufficiency or mild to moderate liver disease b should be considered in patients with severe liver impairment. Although other proton pumps exist in the body, the $\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase appears to exist only in the parietal cell and is distinct structurally and functionally from othe $\mathrm{H}^{+}$transporting enzymes.

The intravenous formulations of esomeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole have similar characteristics to th oral drugs. When given to a fasting patient, they inactivate acid pumps that are actively secreting but have no effect on pumps in quiescent, nonsecreting vesicles. Because the half-life of a single injection of the intravenou: formulation is short, acid secretion returns several hours later as pumps move from the tubulo-vesicles to the canalicular surface. Thus, in order to provide maximal inhibition during the first 24-48 hours of treatment, the intravenous formulations must be given as a continuous infusion or as repeated bolus injections. The optimal dosing of intravenous proton pump inhibitors to achieve maximal blockade in fasting patients is not yet established.

From a pharmacokinetic perspective, proton pump inhibitors are ideal drugs: they have a short serum half-life, they are concentrated and activated near their site of action, and they have a long duration of action.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

In contrast to $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists, proton pump inhibitors inhibit both fasting and meal-stimulated secretion becaus' they block the final common pathway of acid secretion, the proton pump. In standard doses, proton pump inhibitors inhibit 90-98\% of 24-hour acid secretion (Figure 63-3). Among commercially available formulations,

40 mg of esomeprazole achieves slightly greater 24-hour gastric acid suppression compared with standard dost of other delayed-release oral proton pump inhibitors (lansoprazole, 30 mg ; rabeprazole, 20 mg ; omeprazole, $20-40 \mathrm{mg}$; or pantoprazole 40 mg ); however, when administered at equivalent doses there is little difference ir clinical efficacy among the different agents. In a crossover study of patients receiving long-term therapy with al five proton pump inhibitors, the mean 24-hour intragastric pH varied from 3.3 (pantoprazole, 40 mg ) to 4.0 (esomeprazole, 40 mg ) and the mean number of hours the pH was higher than 4 varied from 10.1 (pantoprazole, 40 mg ) to 14.0 (esomeprazole, 40 mg ).

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD)}

Proton pump inhibitors are the most effective agents for the treatment of nonerosive and erosive reflux disease esophageal complications of reflux disease (peptic stricture or Barrett's esophagus), and extraesophageal manifestations of reflux disease. Once-daily dosing provides effective symptom relief and tissue healing in 85-90\% of patients; up to 15\% of patients require twice-daily dosing.

GERD symptoms recur in over 80\% of patients within 6 months after discontinuation of a proton pump inhibitor For patients with erosive esophagitis or esophageal complications, long-term daily maintenance therapy with a full-dose or half-dose proton pump inhibitor is usually needed. Many patients with nonerosive GERD may be treated successfully with intermittent courses of proton pump inhibitors or $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists taken as needed ("or demand") for recurrent symptoms.

In current clinical practice, many patients with symptomatic GERD are treated empirically with medications without prior endoscopy, ie, without knowledge of whether the patient has erosive or nonerosive reflux disease. Empiric treatment with proton pump inhibitors provides sustained symptomatic relief in $70-80 \%$ of patients, compared with $50-60 \%$ with $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists. Due to recent cost reductions, proton pump inhibitors are increasingly being used as first-line therapy for patients with symptomatic GERD.

Sustained acid suppression with twice-daily proton pump inhibitors for at least 3 months is used to treat extraesophageal complications of reflux disease (asthma, chronic cough, laryngitis, and noncardiac chest pain).

\section*{PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE}

Compared with $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists, proton pump inhibitors afford more rapid symptom relief and faster ulcer healin for duodenal ulcers and, to a lesser extent, gastric ulcers. All of the pump inhibitors heal more than $90 \%$ of duodenal ulcers within 4 weeks and a similar percentage of gastric ulcers within 6-8 weeks.

\section*{H Pylori- Associated Ulcers}

For H pylori - associated ulcers, there are two therapeutic goals: heal the ulcer and eradicate the organism. The most effective regimens for H pylori eradication are combinations of two antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor Proton pump inhibitors promote eradication of H pylori through several mechanisms: direct antimicrobial properties (minor) and-by raising intragastric pH -lowering the minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics against H pylori. The best treatment regimen consists of a 10-14 day regimen of "triple therapy": a proton pur inhibitor twice daily; clarithromycin, 500 mg twice daily; and amoxicillin, 1 g twice daily. For patients who are allergic to penicillin, metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily, should be substituted for amoxicillin. After completion c triple therapy, the proton pump inhibitor should be continued once daily for a total of 4-6 weeks to ensure complete ulcer healing.

\section*{NSAI D-Associated Ulcers}

For patients with ulcers caused by aspirin or other NSAIDs, either $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists or proton pump inhibitors
provide rapid ulcer healing so long as the NSAID is discontinued; continued use of the NSAID impairs ulcer healing. Treatment with a once-daily proton pump inhibitor promotes ulcer healing despite continued NSAID therapy.

Proton pump inhibitors are also given to prevent ulcer complications from NSAIDs. Asymptomatic peptic ulceration develops in 10-20\% of people taking frequent NSAIDs, and ulcer-related complications (bleeding, perforation) develop in 1-2\% of persons per year. Proton pump inhibitors taken once daily are effective in reducing the incidence of ulcers and ulcer complications in patients taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.

\section*{Prevention of Rebleeding from Peptic Ulcers}

In patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding due to peptic ulcers, the risk of rebleeding from ulcers that havt a visible vessel or adherent clot is increased. Rebleeding in this subset of high-risk ulcers is reduced significantl with use of proton pump inhibitors administered for 3-5 days either as high-dose oral therapy (eg, omeprazole, 40 mg orally twice daily) or as a continuous intravenous infusion. It is believed that an intragastric pH higher than 6 may enhance coagulation and platelet aggregation. The optimal dose of intravenous proton pump inhibitor needed to achieve and maintain this level of near-complete acid inhibition is unknown; however, initial bolus administration ( $60-80 \mathrm{mg}$ ) followed by constant infusion ( $8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{h}$ ) commonly is recommended.

\section*{NONULCER DYSPEPSIA}

Proton pump inhibitors have modest efficacy for treatment of nonulcer dyspepsia, benefiting 10-20\% more patients than placebo. Despite their increasing use for this indication, superiority to $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists (or even placebo) has not been conclusively demonstrated.

\section*{PREVENTION OF STRESS-RELATED MUCOSAL BLEEDING}

Clinically important bleeding from upper gastrointestinal erosions or ulcers occurs in 1-5\% of critically ill patient due to mucosal ischemia. Although most critically ill patients have normal or decreased acid secretion, numerol studies have shown that maintaining intragastric pH higher than 4 reduces the incidence of clinically significant bleeding. The only proton pump inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration for reduction of stressrelated mucosal bleeding is an oral immediate-release omeprazole formulation, which is administered by nasogastric tube twice daily on the first day, then once daily. In a large controlled trial, nasogastric immediaterelease omeprazole had similar efficacy to a continuous intravenous infusion of an $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonist (cimetidine) in the prevention of stress-related bleeding and superior inhibition of gastric acidity (median $\mathrm{pH}>6$ ).

At this time, the optimal agent for the reduction of stress-related mucosal bleeding is uncertain. For patients with nasoenteric tubes, immediate-release omeprazole may be preferred to intravenous $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists becaus of comparable efficacy, lower cost, and ease of administration. For patients without a nasoenteric tube or with significant ileus, intravenous $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists are the preferred agents because of their proven efficacy. Although proton pump inhibitors are increasingly used, there are no controlled trials demonstrating efficacy or optimal dosing.

\section*{GASTRI NOMA AND OTHER HYPERSECRETORY CONDITIONS}

Patients with isolated gastrinomas are best treated with surgical resection. In patients with metastatic or unresectable gastrinomas, massive acid hypersecretion results in peptic ulceration, erosive esophagitis, and malabsorption. Previously, these patients required vagotomy and extraordinarily high doses of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists, which resulted in suboptimal acid suppression. With proton pump inhibitors, excellent acid suppression can be achieved in all patients. Dosage is titrated to reduce basal acid output to less than $5-10 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{h}$. Typical doses c omeprazole are $60-120 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

\section*{GENERAL}

Proton pump inhibitors are extremely safe. Diarrhea, headache, and abdominal pain are reported in 1-5\% of patients, although the frequency of these events is only slightly increased compared with placebo. Proton pump inhibitors do not have teratogenicity in animal models; however, safety during pregnancy has not been established.

\section*{NUTRITION}

Acid is important in releasing vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ from food. A minor reduction in oral cyanocobalamin absorption occur during proton pump inhibition, potentially leading to subnormal $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ levels with prolonged therapy. Acid also promotes absorption of food-bound minerals (iron, calcium, zinc); however, no mineral deficiencies have been reported with proton pump inhibitor therapy.

\section*{RESPIRATORY AND ENTERIC INFECTIONS}

Gastric acid is an important barrier to colonization and infection of the stomach and intestine from ingested bacteria. Increases in gastric bacterial concentrations are detected in patients taking proton pump inhibitors, which is of unclear clinical significance. Some studies have reported an increased risk of both communityacquired respiratory infections and nosocomial pneumonia among patients taking proton pump inhibitors.

A small increased risk of enteric infections may exist in patients taking proton pump inhibitors, especially when traveling in underdeveloped countries. Hospitalized patients may have an increased risk for Clostridium difficile infection.

\section*{POTENTIAL PROBLEMS DUE TO INCREASED SERUM GASTRIN}

Gastrin levels are regulated by intragastric acidity. Acid suppression alters normal feedback inhibition so that median gastrin levels rise 1.5- to 2-fold in patients taking proton pump inhibitors. Although gastrin levels remai within normal limits in most patients, they exceed $500 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}$ (normal, < $100 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}$ ) in $3 \%$. Upon stopping the drug, the levels normalize within 4 weeks.

The rise in serum gastrin levels in patients receiving long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors has raised two theoretical concerns. First, gastrin is a trophic hormone that stimulates hyperplasia of ECL cells. In female rats given proton pump inhibitors for prolonged periods, gastric carcinoid tumors developed in areas of ECL hyperplasia. Although humans who take proton pump inhibitors for a long time may exhibit ECL hyperplasia in response to hypergastrinemia, carcinoid tumor formation has not been documented. Second, hypergastrinemia increases the proliferative rate of colonic mucosa, potentially promoting carcinogenesis. In humans, hypergastrinemia caused by vagotomy, atrophic gastritis, or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome has not been associater with increased colon cancer risk. At present, routine monitoring of serum gastrin levels is not recommended in patients receiving prolonged proton pump inhibitor therapy.

\section*{OTHER POTENTIAL PROBLEMS DUE TO DECREASED GASTRIC ACIDITY}

Among patients infected with H pylori, long-term acid suppression leads to increased chronic inflammation in tr gastric body and decreased inflammation in the antrum. Concerns have been raised that increased gastric inflammation may accelerate gastric gland atrophy (atrophic gastritis) and intestinal metaplasia-known risk factors for gastric adenocarcinoma. A special US FDA Gastrointestinal Advisory Committee concluded that there is no evidence that prolonged proton pump inhibitor therapy produces the kind of atrophic gastritis (multifocal atrophic gastritis) or intestinal metaplasia that is associated with increased risk of adenocarcinoma. Routine testing for H pylori is no longer recommended in patients who require long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy.

Long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy is associated with the development of small benign gastric fundic-glar polyps in a small number of patients, which may disappear after stopping the drug and are of uncertain clinical significance.

\section*{Drug I nteractions}

Decreased gastric acidity may alter absorption of drugs for which intragastric acidity affects drug bioavailability, eg, ketoconazole and digoxin. All proton pump inhibitors are metabolized by hepatic P450 cytochromes, includiı CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Due to their short-half lives, clinically significant drug interactions are rare. Omeprazole may inhibit the metabolism of coumadin, diazepam, and phenytoin. Esomeprazole also may decrease metabolism of diazepam. Lansoprazole may enhance clearance of theophylline. Rabeprazole and pantoprazole have no significant drug interactions.

\section*{Mucosal Protective Agents}

The gastroduodenal mucosa has evolved a number of defense mechanisms to protect itself against the noxious effects of acid and pepsin. Both mucus and epithelial cell-cell tight junctions restrict back diffusion of acid and pepsin. Epithelial bicarbonate secretion establishes a pH gradient within the mucous layer in which the pH rang from 7 at the mucosal surface to 1-2 in the gastric lumen. Blood flow carries bicarbonate and vital nutrients to surface cells. Areas of injured epithelium are quickly repaired by restitution, a process in which migration of cell from gland neck cells seals small erosions to reestablish intact epithelium. Mucosal prostaglandins appear to be important in stimulating mucus and bicarbonate secretion and mucosal blood flow. A number of agents that potentiate these mucosal defense mechanisms are available for the prevention and treatment of acid-peptic disorders.

\section*{SUCRALFATE}

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Sucralfate is a salt of sucrose complexed to sulfated aluminum hydroxide. In water or acidic solutions it forms a viscous, tenacious paste that binds selectively to ulcers or erosions for up to 6 hours. Sucralfate has limited solubility, breaking down into sucrose sulfate (strongly negatively charged) and an aluminum salt. Less than $3 \%$ of intact drug and aluminum is absorbed from the intestinal tract; the remainder is excreted in the feces.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

A variety of beneficial effects have been attributed to sucralfate, but the precise mechanism of action is unclear It is believed that the negatively charged sucrose sulfate binds to positively charged proteins in the base of ulcers or erosion, forming a physical barrier that restricts further caustic damage and stimulates mucosal prostaglandin and bicarbonate secretion.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Sucralfate is administered in a dosage of 1 g four times daily on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before meals). At present, its clinical uses are limited. Sucralfate (administered as a slurry through a nasogastric tube', reduces the incidence of clinically significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill patients hospitalized the intensive care unit, although it is slightly less effective than intravenous $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists. Sucralfate is still used by many clinicians for prevention of stress-related bleeding because of concerns that acid-inhibitory therapies (antacids, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists, or proton pump inhibitors) may increase the risk of nosocomial pneumonia

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Because it is not absorbed, sucralfate is virtually devoid of systemic adverse effects. Constipation occurs in $2 \%$ of patients due to the aluminum salt. Because a small amount of aluminum is absorbed, it should not be used $f$ prolonged periods in patients with renal insufficiency.

\section*{Drug I nteractions}

Sucralfate may bind to other medications, impairing their absorption.

\section*{PROSTAGLANDI N ANALOGS}

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

The human gastrointestinal mucosa synthesizes a number of prostaglandins (see Chapter 18); the primary one are prostaglandins E and F. Misoprostol, a methyl analog of $\mathrm{PGE}_{1}$, has been approved for gastrointestinal conditions. Following oral administration, it is rapidly absorbed and metabolized to a metabolically active free acid. The serum half-life is less than 30 minutes; hence, it must be administered 3-4 times daily. It is excreted in the urine; however, dose reduction is not needed in patients with renal insufficiency.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Misoprostol has both acid inhibitory and mucosal protective properties. It is believed to stimulate mucus and bicarbonate secretion and enhance mucosal blood flow. In addition, it binds to a prostaglandin receptor on parietal cells, reducing histamine-stimulated cAMP production and causing modest acid inhibition. Prostaglandin have a variety of other actions, including stimulation of intestinal electrolyte and fluid secretion, intestinal motility, and uterine contractions.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Peptic ulcers develop in approximately 10-20\% of patients who receive long-term NSAID therapy (see Proton Pump Inhibitors, above). Misoprostol reduces the incidence of NSAID-induced ulcers to less than $3 \%$ and the incidence of ulcer complications by $50 \%$. It is approved for prevention of NSAID-induced ulcers in high-risk patients; however, it has never achieved widespread use due to its high adverse effect profile and need for multiple daily dosing. As discussed, proton pump inhibitors may be as effective as and better tolerated than misoprostol for this indication. Cyclooxygenase-2-selective NSAIDs, which may have less gastrointestinal toxicit (see Chapter 36), offer another option for patients at high-risk for NSAID-induced complications.

\section*{Adverse Effects \& Drug Interactions}

Diarrhea and cramping abdominal pain occurs in 10-20\% of patients. Because misoprostol stimulates uterine contractions (see Chapter 18), it should not be used during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential unless they have a negative serum pregnancy test and are compliant with effective contraceptive measures. Nc significant drug interactions are reported.

\section*{COLLOI DAL BISMUTH COMPOUNDS}

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

The only bismuth compound available in the USA is bismuth subsalicylate, a nonprescription formulation containing bismuth and salicylate. In other countries, bismuth subcitrate and bismuth dinitrate are also available. Bismuth subsalicylate undergoes rapid dissociation within the stomach, allowing absorption of salicylate. Over $99 \%$ of the bismuth appears in the stool. Although minimal ( $<1 \%$ ) bismuth is absorbed, it is stored in many tissues and has slow renal excretion. Salicylate (like aspirin) is readily absorbed and excreted in the urine.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Like sucralfate, bismuth probably coats ulcers and erosions, creating a protective layer against acid and pepsin. It may also stimulate prostaglandin, mucus, and bicarbonate secretion. Bismuth subsalicylate reduces stool frequency and liquidity in acute infectious diarrhea, due to salicylate inhibition of intestinal prostaglandin and chloride secretion. Bismuth has direct antimicrobial effects and binds enterotoxins, accounting for its benefit in preventing and treating traveler's diarrhea. Bismuth compounds have direct antimicrobial activity against H pylori.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

In spite of the lack of comparative trials, nonprescription bismuth compounds are widely used by patients for tr nonspecific treatment of dyspepsia and acute diarrhea. Bismuth subsalicylate also is used for the prevention of traveler's diarrhea ( 30 mL or 2 tablets four times daily).

Bismuth compounds have been used in multidrug regimens for the eradication of H pylori infection. In the USA, "triple therapy" regimen has been used, consisting of bismuth subsalicylate ( 2 tablets; 262 mg each), tetracycline ( 500 mg ), and metronidazole ( 250 mg ), each taken four times daily for 14 days. Because of the need for four-times daily dosing and the high adverse effect profile, this regimen is no longer used as first-line therapy for H pylori eradication (see Proton Pump Inhibitors above). For patients with resistant infections, "quadruple therapy" consisting of a proton pump inhibitor twice daily in addition to the three-drug bismuth-bası regimen four times daily for 14 days is highly effective. In Europe, bismuth subcitrate is used instead of bismut subsalicylate, and treatment for 7-10 days may be sufficient.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

All bismuth formulations have an excellent safety profile. Bismuth causes blackening of the stool, which may be confused with gastrointestinal bleeding. Liquid formulations may cause harmless darkening of the tongue. Bismuth agents should be used for short periods only and should be avoided in patients with renal insufficiency. Prolonged usage of some bismuth compounds may rarely lead to bismuth toxicity, resulting in encephalopathy (ataxia, headaches, confusion, seizures). However, such toxicity is not reported with bismuth subsalicylate or bismuth citrate. High dosages of bismuth subsalicylate may lead to salicylate toxicity.

\section*{DRUGS STI MULATI NG GASTROI NTESTI NAL MOTI LI TY}

Drugs that can selectively stimulate gut motor function (prokinetic agents) have significant potential clinical usefulness. Agents that increase lower esophageal sphincter pressures may be useful for GERD. Drugs that improve gastric emptying may be helpful for gastroparesis and postsurgical gastric emptying delay. Agents thal stimulate the small intestine may be beneficial for postoperative ileus or chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Finally, agents that enhance colonic transit may be useful in the treatment of constipation. Unfortunately, only : limited number of agents in this group are available for clinical use at this time.

\section*{PHYSIOLOGY OF THE ENTERIC NERVOUS SYSTEM}

The enteric nervous system (see also Chapter 6) is composed of interconnected networks of ganglion cells and nerve fibers mainly located in the submucosa (submucosal plexus) and between the circular and longitudinal muscle layers (myenteric plexus). These networks give rise to nerve fibers that connect with the mucosa and deep muscle. Although extrinsic sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves project onto the submucosal and myenteric plexuses, the enteric nervous system can independently regulate gastrointestinal motility and
secretion. Extrinsic primary afferent neurons project via the dorsal root ganglia or vagus nerve to the central nervous system (Figure 63-5). Release of serotonin (5-HT) from intestinal mucosa enterochromaffin (EC) cells stimulates $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptors on the extrinsic afferent nerves, stimulating nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Serotonin also stimulates submucosal 5-HT ${ }_{1}$ p receptors of the intrinsic primary afferent nerves (IPANs), which contain calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and acetylcholine and project to myenteric plexus interneurons. 5- $\mathrm{HT}_{4}$ receptors on the presynaptic terminals of the IPANs appear to enhance release of CGRP or acetylcholine. The myenteric interneurons are important in controlling the peristaltic reflex, promoting release of excitatory mediators proximally and inhibitory mediators distally. Motilin may stimulate excitatory neurons or muscle cells directly. Dopamine acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the gastrointestinal tract, decreasing the intensity . esophageal and gastric contractions.

(Redrawn from Gershon MD: Serotonin and its implication for the management of irritable bowel syndrome. Rev Gastroentei

Although there are at least 14 serotonin receptor subtypes, 5-HT drug development for gastrointestinal applications to date has focused on 5-HT 3 -receptor antagonists and 5-HT 4 -receptor agonists. These agents—which have effects upon gastrointestinal motility and visceral afferent sensation-are discussed below under Drugs Used for the Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Antiemetic Agents. Other drugs acting on 5-HT receptors are discussed in Chapters 16, 29, and 30.

\section*{CHOLI NOMI METI C AGENTS}

Cholinomimetic agonists such as bethanechol stimulate muscarinic $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ receptors on muscle cells and at myenteric plexus synapses (see Chapter 7). Bethanechol was used in the past for the treatment of GERD and gastroparesis. Due to multiple cholinergic effects and the advent of less toxic agents, it is now seldom used. Th. acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine can enhance gastric, small intestine, and colonic emptying. Intravenous neostigmine has enjoyed a resurgence in clinical usage for the treatment of hospitalized patients with acute large bowel distention (known as acute colonic pseudo-obstruction or Ogilvie's syndrome). Administration of 2 mg results in prompt colonic evacuation of flatus and feces in the majority of patients. Cholinergic effects include excessive salivation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bradycardia.

\section*{METOCLOPRAMI DE \& DOMPERI DONE}

Metoclopramide and domperidone are dopamine $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ receptor antagonists. Within the gastrointestinal tract activation of dopamine receptors inhibits cholinergic smooth muscle stimulation; blockade of this effect is believed to be the primary prokinetic mechanism of action of these agents. These agents increase esophageal peristaltic amplitude, increase lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and enhance gastric emptying but have no effect upon small intestine or colonic motility. Metoclopramide and domperidone also block dopamine $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the medulla (area postrema), resulting in potent antinausea anc antiemetic action.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD)}

Metoclopramide is available for clinical use in the USA; domperidone is available in many other countries. These agents are sometimes used in the treatment of symptomatic GERD but are not effective in patients with erosive esophagitis. Due to the superior efficacy and safety of antisecretory agents in the treatment of heartburn, prokinetic agents are used mainly in combination with antisecretory agents in patients with regurgitation or refractory heartburn.

\section*{I MPAI RED GASTRI C EMPTYI NG}

These agents are widely used in the treatment of patients with delayed gastric emptying due to postsurgical disorders (vagotomy, antrectomy) and diabetic gastroparesis. Metoclopramide is sometimes administered in hospitalized patients to promote advancement of nasoenteric feeding tubes from the stomach into the duodenum.

\section*{NONULCER DYSPEPSIA}

These agents lead to symptomatic improvement in a small number of patients with chronic dyspepsia.

\section*{PREVENTION OF VOMITING}

Due to their potent antiemetic action, metoclopramide and domperidone are used for the prevention and
treatment of emesis (see Antiemetic Agents).

\section*{POSTPARTUM LACTATION STI MULATI ON}

Domperidone is sometimes recommended to promote postpartum lactation (see also Adverse Effects).

\section*{Adverse Effects}

The most common adverse effects of metoclopramide involve the central nervous system. Restlessness, drowsiness, insomnia, anxiety, and agitation occur in 10-20\% of patients, especially the elderly. Extrapyramide effects (dystonias, akathisia, parkinsonian features) due to central dopamine receptor blockade occur acutely ir 25\% of patients given high doses and in 5\% of patients receiving long-term therapy. Tardive dyskinesia, sometimes irreversible, has developed in patients treated for a prolonged period with metoclopramide. For this reason, long-term use should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, especially in the elderly. Elevated prolactin levels (caused by both metoclopramide and domperidone) can cause galactorrhea, gynecomastia, impotence, and menstrual disorders.

Domperidone is extremely well tolerated. Because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier to a significant degree, neuropsychiatric and extrapyramidal effects are rare.

\section*{MACROLI DES}

Macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin directly stimulate motilin receptors on gastrointestinal smooth muscle and promote the onset of a migrating motor complex. Intravenous erythromycin ( $3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) is beneficial in some patients with gastroparesis; however, tolerance rapidly develops. It may be used in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage to promote gastric emptying of blood prior to endoscopy.

\section*{CHLORIDE CHANNEL ACTIVATOR}

Lubiprostone is a recently approved prostanoic acid derivative labeled for use in chronic constipation. It is reported to act by stimulating chloride channel opening in the intestine. This increases liquid secretion into the intestine and shortens intestinal transit time. The drug also delays gastric emptying, which may cause nausea. No comparative studies with other drugs are available.

\section*{LAXATIVES}

The overwhelming majority of people do not need laxatives, yet they are self-prescribed by a large portion of tr population. For most people, intermittent constipation is best prevented with a high fiber diet, adequate fluid intake, regular exercise, and the heeding of nature's call. Patients not responding to dietary changes or fiber supplements should undergo medical evaluation prior to the initiation of long-term laxative treatment. Laxative may be classified by their major mechanism of action, but many work through more than one mechanism.

\section*{BULK-FORMI NG LAXATI VES}

Bulk-forming laxatives are indigestible, hydrophilic colloids that absorb water, forming a bulky, emollient gel the distends the colon and promotes peristalsis. Common preparations include natural plant products (psyllium, methylcellulose) and synthetic fibers (polycarbophil). Bacterial digestion of plant fibers within the colon ma lead to increased bloating and flatus.

\section*{STOOL SURFACTANT AGENTS (SOFTENERS)}

These agents soften stool material, permitting water and lipids to penetrate. They may be administered orally c
rectally. Common agents include docusate (oral or enema) or glycerin suppository. In hospitalized patients, docusate is commonly prescribed to prevent constipation and minimize straining. Mineral oil is a clear, viscous oil that lubricates fecal material, retarding water absorption from the stool. It is used to prevent and treat fecal impaction in young children and debilitated adults. It is not palatable but may be mixed with juices. Aspiration can result in a severe lipid pneumonitis. Long-term use can impair absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K

\section*{OSMOTI C LAXATI VES}

The colon can neither concentrate nor dilute fecal fluid: fecal water is isotonic throughout the colon. Osmotic laxatives are soluble but nonabsorbable compounds that result in increased stool liquidity due to an obligate increase in fecal fluid.

\section*{Nonabsorbable Sugars or Salts}

These agents may be used for the treatment of acute constipation or the prevention of chronic constipation.
Magnesium oxide (milk of magnesia) is a commonly used osmotic laxative. It should not be used for prolonged periods in patients with renal insufficiency due to risk of hypermagnesemia. Sorbitol and lactulose are nonabsorbable sugars that can be used to prevent or treat chronic constipation. These sugars are metabolized by colonic bacteria, producing severe flatus and cramps.

High doses of osmotically active agents produce prompt bowel evacuation (purgation) within 1-3 hours. The rapid movement of water into the distal small bowel and colon leads to a high volume of liquid stool followed by rapid relief of constipation. The most commonly used purgatives are magnesium citrate and sodium phosphate. These hyperosmolar agents may lead to intravascular volume depletion and electrolyte fluctuation: hence they should not be used in patients who are frail, elderly, have renal insufficiency, or have significant cardiac disease.

\section*{Balanced Polyethylene Glycol}

Lavage solutions containing polyethylene glycol (PEG) are used for complete colonic cleansing prior to gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures. These balanced, isotonic solutions contain an inert, nonabsorbable, osmotically active sugar (PEG) with sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and potassium chloride. The solution is designed so that no significant intravascular fluid or electrolyte shifts occur. Therefore, they are safe for all patients. The solution should be ingested rapidly ( 4 L over $2-4$ hours) to promote bowel cleansing. For treatment or prevention of chronic constipation, smaller doses of PEG powder may be mixed witr water or juices ( $17 \mathrm{~g} / 8 \mathrm{oz}$ ) and ingested daily. In contrast to sorbitol or lactulose, PEG does not produce significant cramps or flatus.

\section*{STI MULANT LAXATI VES}

Stimulant laxatives (cathartics) induce bowel movements through a number of poorly understood mechanisms. These include direct stimulation of the enteric nervous system and colonic electrolyte and fluid secretion. There has been concern that long-term use of cathartics could lead to dependence and destruction of the myenteric plexus, resulting in colonic atony and dilation. More recent research suggests that long-term use of these agent probably is safe in most patients. Cathartics may be required on a long-term basis, especially in patients who a neurologically impaired and in bed-bound patients in long-term care facilities.

\section*{Anthraquinone Derivatives}

Aloe, senna, and cascara occur naturally in plants. These laxatives are poorly absorbed and after hydrolysis is the colon, produce a bowel movement in 6-12 hours when given orally and within 2 hours when given rectally.

Chronic use leads to a characteristic brown pigmentation of the colon known as "melanosis coli." There has bee some concern that these agents may be carcinogenic, but epidemiologic studies do not suggest a relationship $t$ colorectal cancer.

\section*{Diphenylmethane Derivatives}

Due to concerns about possible cardiac toxicity, these agents (eg, phenolphthalein) were removed from the market.

\section*{Castor Oil}

This oil is a potent stimulant laxative. It is hydrolyzed in the upper small intestine to ricinoleic acid, a local irrita that stimulates intestinal motility. Formerly used as a purgative to clean the colon before procedures, it is now seldom used.

\section*{SEROTONI N 5-HT4 -RECEPTOR AGONISTS}

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Pharmacodynamics}

Tegaserod is a serotonin 5- $\mathrm{HT}_{4}$ partial agonist that resembles serotonin in structure. It has high affinity for 5$\mathrm{HT}_{4}$ receptors but no appreciable binding to $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ or dopamine receptors. As discussed earlier, stimulation of 5 $\mathrm{HT}_{4}$ receptors on the presynaptic terminal of submucosal intrinsic primary afferent nerves enhances the release of their neurotransmitters, including calcitonin gene-related peptide, that stimulate second-order enteric neurol to promote the peristaltic reflex (Figure 63-5). These enteric neurons stimulate proximal bowel contraction (via acetylcholine and substance P ) and distal bowel relaxation (via nitric oxide and vasoactive intestinal peptide). Tegaserod promotes gastric emptying and enhances small and large bowel transit but has no effect upon esophageal motility. Stimulation of $5-\mathrm{HT}_{4}$ receptors also activates cAMP-dependent chloride secretion from the colon, leading to increased stool liquidity.

Tegaserod has a bioavailability of only $10 \%$. It should be taken before meals because food further reduces bioavailability by $50 \%$. The drug is metabolized both by gastric acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and hepatic glucuronidation. Approximately $66 \%$ of drug is excreted unchanged in the feces and $33 \%$ as a metabolite in the urine. It should not be given to patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{CHRONIC CONSTIPATION}

Tegaserod is approved for the treatment of patients with chronic constipation. In controlled trials, $40 \%$ of patients treated with tegaserod, $2-6 \mathrm{mg}$ twice daily, had a significant increase in the number of spontaneous bowel movements compared with $25 \%$ receiving placebo. Responders also reported reduced bloating, straining and stool hardness, and enhanced satisfaction. The effect of tegaserod on bowel activity is usually noted within 48 hours. Given its high cost, tegaserod should be reserved for patients with chronic constipation who have failed or are intolerant of other less expensive therapies.

\section*{OTHER USES}

The role of tegaserod in the treatment of other gastrointestinal motility disorders, such as nonulcer dyspepsia, gastroparesis, and chronic constipation, is under investigation. The use of tegaserod in the treatment of irritablı bowel syndrome is discussed later in the chapter.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Tegaserod appears to be an extremely safe agent. Diarrhea occurs in 9\% of patients within the first few days ot
treatment but resolves in the majority of patients. Less than $2 \%$ of patients discontinue the drug because of diarrhea. Although it is stated that the drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier (and does not affect central serotonin receptors), headache may occur.

\section*{Drug Interactions}

Tegaserod has no known effects on cytochrome P450 enzymes and no reported drug interactions.

\section*{ANTI DI ARRHEAL AGENTS}

Antidiarrheal agents may be used safely in patients with mild to moderate acute diarrhea. However, they shoul, not be used in patients with bloody diarrhea, high fever, or systemic toxicity because of the risk of worsening tr underlying condition. They should be discontinued in patients whose diarrhea is worsening despite therapy. Antidiarrheals are also used to control chronic diarrhea caused by such conditions as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

\section*{OPIOID AGONISTS}

Opioids have significant constipating effects (see Chapter 31). They increase colonic phasic segmenting activity through inhibition of presynaptic cholinergic nerves in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses and lead to increased colonic transit time and fecal water absorption. They also decrease mass colonic movements and the gastrocolic reflex. Although all opioids have antidiarrheal effects, central nervous system effects and potential fi addiction limit the usefulness of most. Loperamide is a nonprescription opioid agonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier and has no analgesic properties or potential for addiction. Tolerance to long-term use has nc been reported. It is typically administered in doses of 2 mg taken one to four times daily. Diphenoxylate is another opioid agonist that has no analgesic properties in standard doses; however, higher doses have central nervous system effects and prolonged use can lead to opioid dependence. Commercial preparations commonly contain small amounts of atropine to discourage overdosage ( 2.5 mg diphenoxylate with 0.025 mg atropine). The anticholinergic properties of atropine may contribute to the antidiarrheal action.

\section*{COLLOI DAL BISMUTH COMPOUNDS}

See the section under Mucosal Protective Agents.

\section*{KAOLI N \& PECTI N}

Kaolin is a naturally occurring hydrated magnesium aluminum silicate (attapulgite), and pectin is an indigestible carbohydrate derived from apples. Both appear to act as absorbents of bacteria, toxins, and fluid, thereby decreasing stool liquidity and number. They may be useful in acute diarrhea but are seldom used on a chronic basis. A common commercial preparation is Kaopectate. The usual dose is $1.2-1.5 \mathrm{~g}$ after each loose bowel movement (maximum: $9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ ). Kaolin-pectin formulations are not absorbed and have no significant adverse effects except constipation. They should not be taken within 2 hours of other medications (which they may binc

\section*{BILE SALT- BI NDI NG RESI NS}

Conjugated bile salts are normally absorbed in the terminal ileum. Disease of the terminal ileum (eg, Crohn's disease) or surgical resection leads to malabsorption of bile salts, which may cause colonic secretory diarrhea. The bile salt-binding resins cholestyramine or colestipol may decrease diarrhea caused by excess fecal bile acids (see Chapter 35). The usual dose is $4-5 \mathrm{~g}$ one to three times daily before meals. Adverse effects include bloating, flatulence, constipation, and fecal impaction. In patients with diminished circulating bile acid pools,
further removal of bile acids may lead to an exacerbation of fat malabsorption. These agents bind a number of drugs and reduce their absorption; hence, they should not be given within 2 hours of other drugs.

\section*{OCTREOTI DE}

Somatostatin is a 14 amino acid peptide that is released in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas from paracrine cells, D-cells, and enteric nerves as well as from the hypothalamus (see Chapter 37). It is a key regulatory peptide that has many physiologic effects:
1. It inhibits the secretion of numerous hormones and transmitters, including gastrin, cholecystokinin, glucagon, growth hormone, insulin, secretin, pancreatic polypeptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and HT.
2. It reduces intestinal fluid secretion and pancreatic secretion.
3. It slows gastrointestinal motility and inhibits gallbladder contraction.
4. It induces direct contraction of vascular smooth muscle, leading to a reduction of portal and splanchr blood flow.
5. It inhibits secretion of some anterior pituitary hormones.

The clinical usefulness of somatostatin is limited by its short half-life in the circulation ( 3 minutes) when it is administered by intravenous injection. Octreotide is a synthetic octapeptide with actions similar to somatostatin. When administered intravenously, it has a serum half-life of 1.5 hours. It also may be administered by subcutaneous injection, resulting in a 6- to 12-hour duration of action. A longer-acting formulation is available for once-monthly depot intramuscular injection.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{INHIBITION OF ENDOCRINE TUMOR EFFECTS}

Two gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoid, VI Poma) cause secretory diarrhea and systemic symptoms such as flushing and wheezing. For patients with advanced symptomatic tumors that cannot be completely removed by surgery, octreotide decreases secretory diarrhea and systemic symptoms through inhibition of hormonal secretion and may slow tumor progression.

\section*{OTHER CAUSES OF DIARRHEA}

Octreotide inhibits intestinal secretion and has dose-related affects on bowel motility. In low doses ( 50 mcg subcutaneously) it stimulates motility, whereas at higher doses (eg, $100-250 \mathrm{mcg}$ subcutaneously), it inhibits motility. Octreotide is effective in higher doses for the treatment of diarrhea due to vagotomy or dumping syndrome as well as for diarrhea caused by short bowel syndrome or AIDS. Octreotide has been used in low doses ( 50 mcg subcutaneously) to stimulate small bowel motility in patients with small bowel bacterial overgrowth or intestinal pseudo-obstruction secondary to scleroderma.

\section*{OTHER USES}

Because it inhibits pancreatic secretion, octreotide may be of value in patients with pancreatic fistula. The role ( octreotide in the treatment of pituitary tumors (eg, acromegaly) is discussed in Chapter 37. Octreotide is sometimes used in gastrointestinal bleeding (see below).

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Impaired pancreatic secretion may cause steatorrhea, which can lead to fat-soluble vitamin deficiency. Alterations in gastrointestinal motility cause nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence, and diarrhea. Due to inhibition
of gallbladder contractility and alterations in fat absorption, long-term use can cause formation of sludge or gallstones in over half of patients, which rarely results in the development of acute cholecystitis. Because octreotide alters the balance between insulin, glucagon, and growth hormone, hyperglycemia or, less frequentl! hypoglycemia (usually mild) can occur. Prolonged treatment with octreotide may result in hypothyroidism. Octreotide also can cause bradycardia.

\section*{DRUGS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME}

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an idiopathic chronic, relapsing disorder characterized by abdominal discomfo (pain, bloating, distention, or cramps) in association with alterations in bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation, or both). With episodes of abdominal pain or discomfort, patients note a change in the frequency or consistency of their bowel movements.

Pharmacologic therapies for irritable bowel syndrome are directed at relieving abdominal pain and discomfort and improving bowel function. For patients with predominant diarrhea, antidiarrheal agents, especially loperamide, are helpful in reducing stool frequency and fecal urgency. For patients with predominant constipation, fiber supplements may lead to softening of stools and reduced straining; however, increased gas production may exacerbate bloating and abdominal discomfort. Consequently, osmotic laxatives, especially mill of magnesia, are commonly used to soften stools and promote increased stool frequency.

For the treatment of chronic abdominal pain, low doses of tricyclic antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline or desipramine, $10-50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) appear to be helpful (see Chapter 30). At these doses, these agents have no effect on mood but may alter central processing of visceral afferent information. The anticholinergic properties of thes agents also may have effects on gastrointestinal motility and secretion, reducing stool frequency and liquidity o. stools. Finally, tricyclic antidepressants may alter receptors for enteric neurotransmitters such as serotonin, affecting visceral afferent sensation.

Several other agents are available that are specifically intended for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.

\section*{ANTI SPASMODI CS (ANTI CHOLI NERGI CS)}

Some agents are promoted as providing relief of abdominal pain or discomfort through antispasmodic actions. However, small or large bowel spasm has not been found to be an important cause of symptoms in patients wit irritable bowel syndrome. These agents work primarily through anticholinergic activities. Commonly used medications in this class include dicyclomine and hyoscyamine. These drugs inhibit muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the enteric plexus and on smooth muscle. Efficacy of these agents for relief of abdominal symptom has never been convincingly demonstrated. At low doses, they have minimal autonomic effects. However, at higher doses they exhibit significant additional anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth, visual disturbances, urinary retention, and constipation. For these reasons, these drugs are infrequently used.

\section*{SEROTONI N 5-HT3 -RECEPTOR ANTAGONI STS}

As discussed earlier, $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptors in the gastrointestinal tract activate visceral afferent pain sensation via extrinsic sensory neurons from the gut to the spinal cord and central nervous system. Inhibition of afferent gastrointestinal $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptors may inhibit unpleasant visceral afferent sensation, including nausea, bloating, and pain. Blockade of central $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptors also reduces the central response to visceral afferent stimulation In addition, $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$-receptor blockade on the terminals of enteric cholinergic neurons inhibits colonic motility, especially in the left colon, increasing total colonic transit time.

Alosetron is a $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ antagonist that has been approved for the treatment of patients with severe irritable bow syndrome with diarrhea (Figure 63-6). Four other $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, an palonosetron) have been approved for the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting (see Antiemetics); however, their efficacy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome has not been determined. The differences between these $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ antagonists that determine their pharmacodynamic effects have not been well studied.

Chemical structure of serotonin; the $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ antagonists ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, and alosetron; and the $5-\mathrm{HT}_{4}$ partial agonist tegaserod.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Pharmacodynamics}

Alosetron is a highly potent and selective antagonist of the $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptor. It is rapidly absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract with a bioavailability of $50-60 \%$ and has a plasma half-life of 1.5 hours but a much longer duration of effect. It undergoes extensive hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolism with renal excretion of most metabolites. Alosetron binds with higher affinity and dissociates more slowly from $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptors than other 5 . $\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ antagonists, which may account for its long duration of action.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Alosetron currently is approved for the treatment of women with severe irritable bowel syndrome in whom diarrhea is the predominant symptom ("diarrhea-predominant IBS"). Efficacy in men has not been established. In a dosage of 1 mg once or twice daily, it reduces IBS-related lower abdominal pain, cramps, urgency, and diarrhea. Approximately 50-60\% of patients report adequate relief of pain and discomfort compared with 30-40\% of patients treated with placebo. It also leads to a reduction in the mean number of bowel movements per day and improvement in stool consistency. This agent has not been evaluated for the treatment of other causes of diarrhea.

\section*{Adverse Events}

In contrast to the excellent safety profile of other $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$-receptor antagonists, alosetron is associated with rare but serious gastrointestinal toxicity. Constipation occurs in up to $30 \%$ of patients with diarrhea-predominant IB! requiring discontinuation of the drug in $10 \%$. Serious complications of constipation requiring hospitalization or surgery have occurred in 1 of every 1000 patients. Episodes of ischemic colitis—some fatal—have been reporter in up to 3 per 1000 patients. Given the seriousness of these adverse events, alosetron is restricted to women with severe diarrhea-predominant IBS who have not responded to conventional therapies and who have been educated about the relative risks and benefits.

\section*{Drug I nteractions}

Despite being metabolized by a number of CYP enzymes, alosetron does not appear to have clinically significant interactions with other drugs.

\section*{SEROTONI N 5-HT4 -RECEPTOR AGONISTS}

The pharmacology of tegaserod is discussed under Laxatives, above. This agent is approved for the short-term treatment of women with irritable bowel syndrome who have predominant constipation. Controlled studies have demonstrated a modest improvement (approximately 15\%) in patient global satisfaction and a reduction in severity of pain and bloating in patients treated with tegaserod, 6 mg twice daily, compared with placebo. Tegaserod also increases the number of bowel movements per week and reduces the hardness of stools. Given the expense of this agent, it should be reserved for patients with moderate to severe symptoms who have faile to respond to standard therapies (ie, fiber supplementation, laxatives). Although its use is approved for up to 1 weeks, long-term therapy may be considered for patients who demonstrate a good response.

\section*{ANTI EMETI C AGENTS}

Nausea and vomiting may be manifestations of a wide variety of conditions, including adverse effects from medications; systemic disorders or infections; pregnancy; vestibular dysfunction; central nervous system infection or increased pressure; peritonitis; hepatobiliary disorders; radiation or chemotherapy; and gastrointestinal obstruction, dysmotility, or infections.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}

The brainstem vomiting center is located in the lateral medullary reticular formation and coordinates the complı act of vomiting through interactions with cranial nerves VIII and X and neural networks in the nucleus tractus solitarius that control respiratory, salivatory, and vasomotor centers. High concentrations of muscarinic $\mathrm{M}_{1}$, histamine $\mathrm{H}_{1}$, and serotonin $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptors have been identified in the vomiting center.

There are five sources of afferent input to the vomiting center:
1. The chemoreceptor trigger zone is located in the fourth ventricle in the area postrema. This is outside the blood-brain barrier and is accessible to emetogenic stimuli in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid. The chemoreceptor trigger zone is rich in dopamine $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ receptors, serotonin $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptors, neurokinin 1 ( $\mathrm{NK}_{1}$ ), and opioid receptors.
2. The vestibular system is important in motion sickness via cranial nerve VIII. It is rich in muscarinic ar histamine $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ receptors.
3. Irritation of the pharynx, innervated by the vagus nerve, provokes a prominent gag and retch response.
4. Vagal and spinal afferent nerves from the gastrointestinal tract are rich in $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptors. Irritation the gastrointestinal mucosa by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, distention, or acute infectious gastroenteritis leads to release of mucosal serotonin and activation of these receptors, which stimulate vagal afferent input to the vomiting center and chemoreceptor trigger zone.
5. The central nervous system plays a role in vomiting due to psychiatric disorders, stress, and anticipatory vomiting prior to cancer chemotherapy.

Identification of the different neurotransmitters involved with emesis has allowed development of a diverse grou of antiemetic agents that have affinity for various receptors. Combinations of antiemetic agents with different mechanisms of action are often used, especially in patients with vomiting due to chemotherapeutic agents.

\section*{SEROTONI N 5-HT3 ANTAGONISTS}

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Pharmacodynamics}

Selective $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$-receptor antagonists have potent antiemetic properties that are mediated mainly through central $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$-receptor blockade in the vomiting center and chemoreceptor trigger zone and blockade of peripheral $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptors on extrinsic intestinal vagal and spinal afferent nerves. The antiemetic action of thes agents is restricted to emesis attributable to vagal stimulation (eg, postoperative) and chemotherapy; other emetic stimuli such as motion sickness are poorly controlled.

Four agents are available: ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, and palonosetron. The first three agents (ondansetron, granisetron, and dolasetron, Figure 63-6) have a serum half-life of 4-9 hours and may be administered once daily by oral or intravenous routes. All three drugs have comparable efficacy and tolerability when administered at equipotent doses. Palonosetron is a newer intravenous agent that has greater affinity for the $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptor and a long serum half-life of 40 hours. All four drugs undergo extensive hepatic metabolism and are eliminated by renal and hepatic excretion. However, dose reduction is not required in geriatric patients or patients with renal insufficiency. For patients with hepatic insufficiency, dose reduction may be required with ondansetron.

These agents do not inhibit dopamine or muscarinic receptors. They do not have effects on esophageal or gastr motility but may slow colonic transit.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING}

5- $\mathrm{HT}_{3}$-receptor antagonists are the primary agents for the prevention of acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and emesis. When used alone, these drugs have little or no efficacy for the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting (ie, occurring > 24 hours after chemotherapy). The drugs are most effective when given as a single dose by intravenous injection 30 minutes prior to administration of chemotherapy in the following doses: ondansetron, 24-32 mg; granisetron, 1 mg ; dolasetron, 100 mg ; or palonosetron, 0.25 mg . A single oral dose given 1 hour before chemotherapy may be equally effective in the following regimens: granisetron, 2 mg ; dolasetron, 100 mg . Ondansetron may be given as a single oral dose ( $16-24 \mathrm{mg}$ ) or as 8 mg every $8-12$ hours for 1-2 days. Although $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$-receptor antagonists are effective as single agents for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, their efficacy is enhanced by combination therapy with a corticosteroid (dexamethasone) and $\mathrm{NK}_{1}$ receptor antagonist (see below).

\section*{POSTOPERATIVE AND POSTRADIATION NAUSEA AND VOMITI NG}

5- $\mathrm{HT}_{3}$-receptor antagonists are used to prevent or treat postoperative nausea and vomiting. Due to adverse effects and increased restrictions on use of other antiemetic agents, $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$-receptor antagonists are increasing used for this indication. They are also effective in the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing radiation therapy to the whole body or abdomen.

\section*{OTHER INDICATIONS}

The efficacy of 5-HT3 -receptor antagonists in the treatment of nausea and vomiting due to acute or chronic medical illness or acute gastroenteritis has not been evaluated.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

These $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$-receptor antagonists are well-tolerated agents with excellent safety profiles. The most commonly reported adverse effects are headache, dizziness, and constipation. All three agents cause a small but statistically significant prolongation of the QT interval, but this is most pronounced with dolasetron. Although cardiac arrhythmias have not been linked to use of dolasetron, it should not be administered to patients with prolonged QT or in conjunction with other medications that may prolong the QT interval.

\section*{Drug I nteractions}

No significant drug interactions have been reported. All four agents undergo some metabolism by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system but they do not appear to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by these enzyme systems. However, other drugs may reduce hepatic clearance of the $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$-receptor antagonists, altering their half-life.

\section*{CORTI COSTEROI DS}

Corticosteroids (dexamethasone, methylprednisolone) have antiemetic properties, but the basis for these effect is unknown. The pharmacology of this class of drugs is discussed in Chapter 39. These agents appear to enhan the efficacy of $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$-receptor antagonists for prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting in patients receiving moderately to highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimens. Although a number of corticosteroids have been used, dexamethasone, $8-20 \mathrm{mg}$ intravenously before chemotherapy, followed by $8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ orally for 2-4 days, is commonly administered.

\section*{NEUROKININ RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS}

Neurokinin $1\left(\mathrm{NK}_{1}\right)$ receptor antagonists have antiemetic properties that are mediated through central blockad in the area postrema. Aprepitant is a highly selective $\mathrm{NK}_{1}$ receptor antagonist that crosses the blood-brain
barrier and occupies brain $\mathrm{NK}_{1}$ receptors. It has no affinity for serotonin, dopamine, or corticosteroid receptors.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Pharmacodynamics}

The oral bioavailability is $65 \%$, and the serum half-life is 12 hours. Aprepitant is metabolized by the liver, primarily by the CYP3A4 pathway.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Aprepitant is used in combination with $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$-receptor antagonists and corticosteroids for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting from highly emetogenic chemotherapeutic regimens. Combined therap with aprepitant, a $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$-receptor antagonist, and dexamethasone prevents acute emesis in $80-90 \%$ of patient compared with less than $70 \%$ treated without aprepitant. Prevention of delayed emesis occurs in more than 70 of patients receiving combined therapy versus $30-50 \%$ treated without aprepitant. Aprepitant is administered orally for 3 days as follows: 125 mg given 1 hour prior to chemotherapy, followed by $80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ for 2 days after chemotherapy.

\section*{Adverse Effects \& Drug Interactions}

Aprepitant may be associated with fatigue, dizziness, and diarrhea.
The drug is metabolized by CYP3A4 and may inhibit the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A4 pathway, potentially increasing their levels, effects, and toxicity. Several chemotherapeutic agents are metabolized by CYP3A4, including docetaxel, paclitaxel, etoposide, irinotecan, imatinib, vinblastine, and vincristine. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 metabolism may significantly increase aprepitant plasma levels (eg, ketoconazole, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, nelfinavir, verapamil, and quinidine). Aprepitant decreases the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients taking warfarin.

\section*{PHENOTHI AZI NES \& BUTYROPHENONES}

Phenothiazines are antipsychotic agents that can be used for their potent antiemetic and sedative properties (see Chapter 29). The antiemetic properties of phenothiazines are mediated through inhibition of dopamine anc muscarinic receptors. Sedative properties are due to their antihistamine activity. The agents most commonly used as antiemetics are prochlorperazine, promethazine, and thiethylperazine.

Antipsychotic butyrophenones also possess antiemetic properties due to their central dopaminergic blockade (see Chapter 29). The main agent used is droperidol, which can be given by intramuscular or intravenous injection. In antiemetic doses, droperidol is extremely sedating. Until recently, it was used extensively for postoperative nausea and vomiting, in conjunction with opiates and benzodiazepines for sedation for surgical al endoscopic procedures, for neuroleptanalgesia, and for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Extrapyramidal effects and hypotension may occur. Droperidol may prolong the QT interval, rarely resulting in fatal episodes of ventricular tachycardia including torsade de pointes. Therefore, droperidol should not be used patients with QT prolongation and should only be used in patients who have not responded adequately to alternative agents.

\section*{SUBSTI TUTED BENZAMI DES}

Substituted benzamides include metoclopramide and trimethobenzamide. Their primary mechanism of antiemetic action is believed to be dopamine-receptor blockade. Trimethobenzamide also has weak antihistaminic activity. For prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting, metoclopramide may be given in the relatively high dosage of $10-20 \mathrm{mg}$ orally or intravenously every 6 hours. The usual dose of
trimethobenzamide is 250 mg orally, 200 mg rectally, or 200 mg by intramuscular injection. As discussed previously, the principal adverse effects of these central dopamine antagonists are extrapyramidal: restlessnes: dystonias, and parkinsonian symptoms.

\section*{$\mathrm{H}_{1}$ ANTI HI STAMI NES \& ANTI CHOLI NERGI CS}

The pharmacology of anticholinergic agents is discussed in Chapter 8 and that of $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antihistaminic agents in Chapter 16. As single agents, these drugs have weak antiemetic activity, although they are particularly useful $f_{1}$ the prevention or treatment of motion sickness. Their use may be limited by dizziness, sedation, confusion, dry mouth, cycloplegia, and urinary retention. Diphenhydramine and one of its salts, dimenhydrinate, are firstgeneration histamine $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists that have significant anticholinergic properties. Because of its sedating properties, diphenhydramine is commonly used in conjunction with other antiemetics for treatment of emesis due to chemotherapy. Meclizine is an $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antihistaminic agent with minimal anticholinergic properties that also causes less sedation. It is used for the prevention of motion sickness and treatment of vertigo due to labyrinth dysfunction.

Hyoscine (scopolamine), a prototypic muscarinic receptor antagonist, is one of the best agents for the prevention of motion sickness. However, it has a very high incidence of anticholinergic effects when given orally or parenterally. It is better tolerated as a transdermal patch. Superiority to dimenhydrinate has not been prove

\section*{BENZODI AZEPI NES}

Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam or diazepam are used prior to the initiation of chemotherapy to reduce anticipatory vomiting or vomiting caused by anxiety. The pharmacology of these agents is presented in Chapter 22.

\section*{CANNABI NOI DS}

Dronabinol is $\Delta^{9}$-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive chemical in marijuana (see Chapter 32 After oral ingestion, the drug is almost completely absorbed but undergoes significant first-pass hepatic metabolism. Its metabolites are excreted slowly over days to weeks in the feces and urine. Like crude marijuan dronabinol is a psychoactive agent that is used medically as an appetite stimulant and as an antiemetic, but the mechanisms for these effects are not understood. Because of the availability of more effective agents, this druc now is uncommonly used for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Combination therapy with phenothiazines provides synergistic antiemetic action and appears to attenuate the adverse effect: of both agents. Dronabinol is usually administered in a dosage of $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ prior to chemotherapy and every 2-. hours as needed. Adverse effects include euphoria, dysphoria, sedation, hallucinations, dry mouth, and increased appetite. It has some autonomic effects that may result in tachycardia, conjunctival injection, and orthostatic hypotension. Dronabinol has no significant drug-drug interactions but may potentiate the clinical effects of other psychoactive agents. Nabilone is a closely related THC analog that has been available in other countries and is approved for use in the USA.

\section*{DRUGS USED TO TREAT I NFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE}

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises two distinct disorders: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The etiology and pathogenesis of these disorders remains unknown. For this reason, pharmacologic treatment of inflammatory bowel disorders often involves drugs that belong to different therapeutic classes and have differer but nonspecific mechanisms of anti-inflammatory action.

\section*{AMI NOSALI CYLATES}

\section*{Chemistry \& Formulations}

Drugs that contain 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) have been used successfully for decades in the treatment inflammatory bowel diseases. 5-ASA differs from salicylic acid only by the addition of an amino group at the 5 (meta) position. Aminosalicylates are believed to work topically (not systemically) in areas of diseased gastrointestinal mucosa. Up to 80\% of unformulated, aqueous 5-ASA is absorbed from the small intestine and does not reach the distal small bowel or colon in appreciable quantities. To overcome the rapid absorption of 5ASA from the proximal small intestine, a number of formulations have been designed to deliver 5-ASA to variou distal segments of the small bowel or the colon. These include sulfasalazine, olsalazine, balsalazide, and various forms of mesalamine.

\section*{AZO COMPOUNDS}

Sulfasalazine, balsalazide, and olsalazine contain 5-ASA bound by an azo ( $\mathrm{N}=\mathrm{N}$ ) bond to an inert compound or another 5-ASA molecule (Figure 63-7). In sulfasalazine, 5-ASA is bound to sulfapyridine; in balsalazide, 5-ASA bound to 4-aminobenzoyl-B-alanine; and in olsalazine, two 5-ASA molecules are bound together. The azo structure markedly reduces absorption of the parent drug from the small intestine. In the terminal ileum and colon, resident bacteria cleave the azo bond by means of an azoreductase enzyme, releasing the active 5-ASA. Consequently, high concentrations of active drug are made available in the terminal ileum or colon.

Chemical structures of aminosalicylates. Azo compounds (balsalazide, olsalazine, sulfasalazine) are converted by bacterial azoreductase to 5-aminosalicylic acid (mesalamine), the active therapeutic moiety.

\section*{MESALAMINE COMPOUNDS}

Other proprietary formulations have been designed that package 5-ASA itself in various ways in order to delivel it to different segments of the small or large bowel. These 5-ASA formulations are known generically as mesalamine. Pentasa is a mesalamine formulation that contains time-release microgranules that release 5ASA throughout the small intestine. Asacol has 5-ASA coated in a pH-sensitive resin that dissolves at pH 7 (the pH of the distal ileum and proximal colon). 5-ASA also may be delivered in high concentrations to the rectum al
sigmoid colon by means of enema formulations (Rowasa) or suppositories (Canasa).

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Pharmacodynamics}

Although unformulated 5-ASA is readily absorbed from the small intestine, absorption of 5-ASA from the colon i extremely low. In contrast, approximately $20-30 \%$ of 5 -ASA from current oral mesalamine formulations is systemically absorbed in the small intestine. Absorbed 5-ASA undergoes N -acetylation in the gut epithelium ar liver to a metabolite that does not possess significant anti-inflammatory activity. The acetylated metabolite is excreted by the kidneys.

Of the azo compounds, $10 \%$ of sulfasalazine and less than $1 \%$ of balsalazide are absorbed as native compound After azoreductase breakdown of sulfasalazine, over 85\% of the carrier molecule sulfapyridine is systemically absorbed from the colon. Sulfapyridine undergoes hepatic metabolism (including acetylation) followed by renal excretion. By contrast, after azoreductase breakdown of balsalazide, over 70\% of the carrier peptide is recovered intact in the feces and only a small amount of systemic absorption occurs.

The mechanism of action of 5-ASA is not certain. The primary action of salicylate and other NSAIDs is due to blockade of prostaglandin synthesis by inhibition of cyclooxygenase. However, the aminosalicylates have variab effects on prostaglandin production. It is thought that 5-ASA modulates inflammatory mediators derived from both the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. Other potential mechanisms of action of the 5-ASA drugs relate to their ability to interfere with the production of inflammatory cytokines. 5-ASA inhibits the activity of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), an important transcription factor for proinflammatory cytokines. 5-ASA may also inhibit cellular functions of natural killer cells, mucosal lymphocytes, and macrophages, and it may scavenge reactive oxygen metabolites.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

5-ASA drugs induce and maintain remission in ulcerative colitis and are considered to be the first-line agents fo treatment of mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis. Their efficacy in Crohn's disease is not as well establishe although many clinicians use 5-ASA agents as first-line therapy for mild to moderate disease involving the color or distal ileum.

The effectiveness of 5-ASA therapy depends in part on achieving high drug concentration at the site of active disease. Thus, 5-ASA suppositories or enemas are useful in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease confined to the rectum (proctitis) or distal colon (proctosigmoiditis). In patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's colitis that extends to the proximal colon, both the azo compounds and mesalamine formulations are useful. Fo the treatment of Crohn's disease involving the small bowel, mesalamine compounds, which release 5-ASA in th small intestine, have a theoretic advantage over the azo compounds.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Sulfasalazine has a high incidence of adverse effects, most of which are attributable to systemic effects of the sulfapyridine molecule. Slow acetylators of sulfapyridine have more frequent and more severe adverse effects than fast acetylators. Up to $40 \%$ of patients cannot tolerate therapeutic doses of sulfasalazine. The most common problems are dose-related and include nausea, gastrointestinal upset, headaches, arthralgias, myalgias, bone marrow suppression, and malaise. Hypersensitivity to sulfapyridine (or, rarely, 5-ASA) can resu in fever, exfoliative dermatitis, pancreatitis, pneumonitis, hemolytic anemia, pericarditis, or hepatitis. Sulfasalazine has also been associated with oligospermia, which reverses upon discontinuation of the drug. Sulfasalazine impairs folate absorption and processing; hence, dietary supplementation with $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ folic acid is
recommended.
In contrast to sulfasalazine, other aminosalicylate formulations are well tolerated. In most clinical trials, the frequency of drug adverse events is similar to that in patients treated with placebo. For unclear reasons, olsalazine may stimulate a secretory diarrhea-which should not be confused with active inflammatory bowel disease-in 10\% of patients. Rare hypersensitivity reactions may occur with all aminosalicylates but are much less common than with sulfasalazine. Careful studies have documented subtle changes indicative of renal tubuli damage in patients receiving high doses of aminosalicylates. Rare cases of interstitial nephritis are reported, particularly in association with high doses of mesalamine formulations; this may be attributable to the higher serum 5-ASA levels attained with these drugs. Sulfasalazine and other aminosalicylates rarely cause worsening of colitis, which may be misinterpreted as refractory colitis.

\section*{GLUCOCORTI COI DS}

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Pharmacodynamics}

In gastrointestinal practice, prednisone and prednisolone are the most commonly used oral glucocorticoids. These drugs have an intermediate duration of biologic activity allowing once-daily dosing.

Hydrocortisone enemas, foam, or suppositories are used to maximize colonic tissue effects and minimize systemic absorption via topical treatment of active inflammatory bowel disease in the rectum and sigmoid color Absorption of hydrocortisone is reduced with rectal administration, although 15-30\% of the administered dosac is absorbed.

Budesonide is a potent synthetic analog of prednisolone that has high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor but is subject to rapid first-pass hepatic metabolism (in part by CYP3A4) resulting in low oral bioavailability. A controlled-release oral formulation of budesonide (Entocort) is available that releases the drug in the distal ileur and colon where it is absorbed. The bioavailability of controlled-release budesonide capsules is approximately $10 \%$.

As in other tissues, glucocorticoids inhibit production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a., IL-1) and chemokines (IL-8); reduce expression of inflammatory cell adhesion molecules; and inhibit gene transcription of nitric oxide synthase, phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}$, cyclooxygenase-2, and NF-kB.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Glucocorticoids are commonly used in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe active inflammatory bowel disease. Active disease is commonly treated with an initial oral dosage of $40-60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ of prednisone or prednisolone. Higher doses have not been shown to be more efficacious but have significantly greater adverse effects. Once a patient responds to initial therapy (usually within 1-2 weeks), the dosage is tapered to minimiz development of adverse effects. In severely ill patients, the drugs are usually administered intravenously.

For the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease involving the rectum or sigmoid colon, rectally administered glucocorticoids are preferred because of their lower systemic absorption.

Oral controlled-release budesonide ( $9 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) is commonly used in the treatment of mild to moderate Crohn's disease involving the ileum and proximal colon. It appears to be slightly less effective than prednisolone in achieving clinical remission, but has significantly less adverse systemic effects.

Corticosteroids are not useful to maintain disease remission. Other medications such as aminosalicylates or immunosuppressive agents should be used for this purpose.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Adverse effects of glucocorticoids are reviewed in Chapter 39.
PURI NE ANALOGS: AZATHI OPRI NE \& 6-MERCAPTOPURINE

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Pharmacodynamics}

Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are purine antimetabolites that have immunosuppressive properties (see Chapters 55 and 56).

The bioavailability of azathioprine ( $80 \%$ ) is superior to 6-MP ( $50 \%$ ). After absorption azathioprine is rapidly converted by a nonenzymatic process to 6-MP. 6-Mercaptopurine subsequently undergoes a complex biotransformation via competing catabolic enzymes (xanthine oxidase and thiopurine methyltransferase) that produce inactive metabolites and anabolic pathways that produce active thioguanine nucleotides. Azathioprine and 6-MP have a serum half-life of less than 2 hours; however, the active 6 -thioguanine nucleotides are concentrated in cells resulting in a prolonged half-life of days. The prolonged kinetics of 6-thioguanine nucleotid results in a median delay of 17 weeks before onset of therapeutic benefit from oral azathioprine or 6-MP is observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

The molecular basis for the therapeutic effects of the purine analogs is unknown. Intracellular 6-thioguanine causes inhibition of purine nucleotide metabolism and DNA synthesis and repair, resulting in inhibition of cell division and proliferation, and may promote T-lymphocyte apoptosis.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Azathioprine and 6-MP are important agents in the induction and maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Although the optimal dose is uncertain, most patients with normal thiopurine-S methyltransferase (TPMT) activity (see below) are treated with $6-\mathrm{MP}, 1-1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$, or azathioprine, $2-2.5$ $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. After 3-6 months of treatment, 50-60\% of patients with active disease achieve remission. These agents help maintain remission in up to 80\% of patients. Among patients who depend on long-term glucocorticoid therapy to control active disease, purine analogs allow dose reduction or elimination of steroids ir the majority.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Dose-related toxicities of azathioprine or 6-MP include nausea, vomiting, bone marrow depression (leading to leukopenia, macrocytosis, anemia, or thrombocytopenia), and hepatic toxicity. Routine laboratory monitoring with complete blood count and liver function tests is required in all patients. Leukopenia or elevations in liver chemistries usually respond to medication dose reduction. Severe leukopenia may predispose to opportunistic infections; leukopenia may respond to therapy with granulocyte stimulating factor. Catabolism of 6-MP by TPMT is low in $11 \%$ and absent in $0.3 \%$ of the population, leading to increased production of active 6 -thioguanine metabolites and increased risk of bone marrow depression. TPMT levels can be measured prior to initiating therapy. These drugs should not be administered to patients with absent TPMT activity and should be initiated a lower doses in patients with intermediate activity. Hypersensitivity reactions to azathioprine or 6-MP occur in 5c, of patients. These include fever, rash, pancreatitis, diarrhea, and hepatitis.

Although there appears to be an increased risk of lymphoma in transplant recipients receiving long-term 6-MP c azathioprine therapy, it is unclear whether the risk is increased among patients with inflammatory bowel diseas These drugs cross the placenta; however, there are many reports of successful pregnancies in women taking these agents, and the risk of teratogenicity appears to be small.

\section*{Drug I nteractions}

Allopurinol markedly reduces xanthine oxide catabolism of the purine analogs, potentially increasing active 6thioguanine nucleotides that may lead to severe leukopenia. The dose of 6-MP or azathioprine should be reduce by at least half in patients taking allopurinol.

\section*{METHOTREXATE}

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Pharmacodynamics}

Methotrexate is another antimetabolite that has beneficial effects in a number of chronic inflammatory diseases including Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis (see Chapter 36), and in cancer (see Chapter 55). Methotrexate may be given orally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly. Reported oral bioavailability is $50-90 \%$; doses used in chronic inflammatory diseases. Intramuscular and subcutaneous methotrexate exhibit nearly complete bioavailability.

The principal mechanism of action is inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme important in the productic of thymidine and purines. At the high doses used for chemotherapy, methotrexate inhibits cellular proliferation. However, at the low doses used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease ( $12-25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{wk}$ ), the antiproliferative effects may not be evident. Methotrexate may interfere with the inflammatory actions of interleukin-1. It may also stimulate increased release of adenosine, an endogenous anti-inflammatory autacoid Methotrexate may also stimulate apoptosis and death of activated T lymphocytes.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Methotrexate is used to induce and maintain remission in patients with Crohn's disease. Its efficacy in ulcerativi colitis is uncertain. To induce remission, patients are treated with $15-25 \mathrm{mg}$ of methotrexate once weekly by subcutaneous injection. If a satisfactory response is achieved within 8-12 weeks, the dose is reduced to 15 mg/wk.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

At higher dosage, methotrexate may cause bone marrow depression, megaloblastic anemia, alopecia, and mucositis. At the doses used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, these events are uncommon but warrant dose reduction if they do occur. Folate supplementation reduces the risk of these events without impairing the anti-inflammatory action.

In patients with psoriasis treated with methotrexate, hepatic damage is common; however, among patients wit inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, the risk is significantly lower. Renal insufficiency may increase risk of hepatic accumulation and toxicity.

\section*{ANTI-TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR THERAPY}

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Pharmacodynamics}

A dysregulation of the T helper cell type 1 (TH1) response is present in inflammatory bowel disease, especially Crohn's disease. One of the key proinflammatory cytokines in the The 1 response is tumor necrosis factor-a. (TN a.). Infliximab is a chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody to human TNF-a. that is described in more deti in Chapter 56.

Infliximab is administered as an intravenous infusion. The plasma concentration is linearly proportionate to dost and its elimination follows first-order kinetics. At therapeutic doses of $5-10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, the half-life of infliximab is
approximately 8-10 days, resulting in plasma disappearance of antibodies over 8-12 weeks.
The biologic activity of TNF-a is mediated by binding of soluble or membrane-bound TNF-a. trimers to cell-surfac TNF-a. receptors. Infliximab binds to soluble TNF-a. trimers with high affinity, preventing the cytokine from binding to its receptors. Total serum TNF-ancentrations may actually increase because binding to infliximab slows TNF-c. clearance. Infliximab also binds to membrane-bound TNF-a. and neutralizes its activity.
Furthermore, the Fc portion of human IgG $_{1}$ region of infliximab promotes complement activation and antibodymediated apoptosis and cellular cytotoxicity of activated T lymphocytes and macrophages.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Infliximab is used in the acute and chronic treatment of patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. It leads to symptomatic improvement in two thirds and disease remission in one third of patients with moderately severe or fistulizing Crohn's disease, including patients who have been dependent on glucocorticoids or who have not responded to 6-MP or methotrexate. The median time to clinical response is 2 weeks. Infliximab induction therapy is generally given in a dosage of $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ at 0,2 , and 6 weeks. Patients wr respond may be treated with repeat infusions every 8 weeks to maintain remission with or without other therapies. Clinical response is maintained in more than $60 \%$ of patients with regularly scheduled infusions; however, one third of patients eventually lose response despite higher doses ( $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) or more frequent infusions. Loss of response in many patients may be due to development of antibodies to infliximab.

Infliximab was recently approved for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who have had inadequate response to mesalamine or corticosteroids. After induction therapy of $5-10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{wk}$ at 0,2 and 6 weeks, $70 \%$ of patients had a clinical response and one third were in clinical remission. With continued maintenance infusions every 8 weeks, approximately one half of patients had continued clinical response.

Although infliximab currently is the only anti-TNF agent approved by the FDA for treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, other anti-TNF agents have demonstrated efficacy in large controlled trials. These include adalimumab (a fully humanized $\mathrm{IgG}_{1}$ antibody) and certolizumab (a polyethylene glycolated Fab fragment of humanized anti-TNF), both of which are administered by subcutaneous injection. It is unknown whether these agents will have similar efficacy to infliximab with reduced complications related to antibody formation.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Serious adverse events occur in $6 \%$ of patients with infliximab therapy. The most important adverse effect of infliximab therapy is infection due to suppression of the Th 1 inflammatory response. Reactivation of latent tuberculosis, with dissemination, has occurred. Before administering infliximab, all patients must undergo purified protein derivative (PPD) testing; prophylactic therapy for tuberculosis is warranted for patients with positive test results. Other infections include pneumonia, sepsis, pneumocystosis, histoplasmosis, listeriosis, ar reactivation of hepatitis $B$.

Antibodies directed at the murine epitope of infliximab develop in approximately one third of patients. These antibodies may attenuate or eliminate the clinical response and increase the likelihood of developing acute or delayed infusion reactions. Antibody development is less likely in patients who receive concomitant therapy witl immunomodulators (ie, 6-MP or methotrexate), regularly scheduled infliximab infusions, or preinfusion treatme with corticosteroids (eg, hydrocortisone, 200 mg ).

Infliximab infusions result in acute adverse infusion reactions in up to 10\% of patients, but discontinuation of the
infusion for severe reactions is required in less than $2 \%$. Infusion reactions are more common with the second I subsequent infusions than with the first. Early mild reactions include fever, headache, dizziness, urticaria, or mi cardiopulmonary symptoms that include chest pain, dyspnea, or hemodynamic instability. Reactions to subsequent infusions may be reduced with prophylactic administration of acetaminophen and diphenhydramine Severe acute reactions, including significant hypotension, shortness of breath, muscle spasms, and chest discomfort, may require treatment with oxygen, epinephrine, and corticosteroids.

A delayed serum sickness-like infusion reaction, which occurs 1-2 weeks after infusion, develops in 1-2\% patients who are retreated with infliximab, especially after a prolonged period. These reactions consist of myalgia, arthralgia, jaw tightness, fever, rash, urticaria, and edema. For patients with either acute severe or delayed infusion reactions, the risks and benefits of subsequent infusions must be weighed; pretreatment with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and corticosteroids is recommended. Positive antinuclear antibodies and ant double-stranded DNA develop in a small number of patients. Development of a lupus-like syndrome has been reported that resolved after discontinuation of the drug.

Infliximab may cause severe hepatic reactions leading to acute hepatic failure. Liver enzymes should be monitored routinely.

Lymphoma has developed in patients who were treated with infliximab. However, the observed rates may be similar to those expected in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Rare cases of multiple sclerosis have be reported. Infliximab may worsen congestive heart failure in patients with cardiac disease.

\section*{PANCREATI C ENZYME SUPPLEMENTS}

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is most commonly caused by cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis, or pancreatic resection. When secretion of pancreatic enzymes falls below 10\% of normal, fat and protein maldigestion occur that can lead to steatorrhea, azotorrhea, vitamin malabsorption, and weight loss. Pancreatic enzyme supplements, which contain a mixture of amylase, lipase, and proteases, are the mainstay of treatment for pancreatic enzyme insufficiency. Two major types of preparations in use are pancreatin and pancrelipase. Pancreatin is an alcohol-derived extract of hog pancreas with relatively low concentrations of lipase and proteolytic enzymes, whereas pancrelipase is an enriched preparation. On a per weight basis, pancrelipase has approximately 12 times the lipolytic activity and more than 4 times the proteolytic activity of pancreatin. Consequently, pancreatin is no longer in common clinical use. Only pancrelipase will be discussed here.

Pancrelipase is available in both nonenteric-coated and enteric-coated preparations. Pancrelipase enzymes are rapidly and permanently inactivated by gastric acids. Therefore, nonenteric-coated preparations (eg, Viokase) should be given concomitantly with acid suppression therapy (proton pump inhibitor or $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonist) in order t reduce acid-mediated destruction within the stomach. Encapsulated formulations contain acid-resistant microspheres (Creon) or microtablets (Pancrease, Ultrase). Enteric-coated formulations are more commonly used because they do not require concomitant acid suppression therapy.

Pancrelipase preparations are administered with each meal and snack. Formulations are available in sizes containing varying amounts of lipase, amylase, and protease. However, manufacturers' listings of enzyme content do not always reflect true enzymatic activity. Enzyme activity may be listed in international units (IU) o USP units. One IU is equal to 2-3 USP units. Dosing should be individualized according to the age and weight ot the patient, the degree of pancreatic insufficiency, and the amount of dietary fat intake. Therapy is initiated at i dose that provides 30,000 IUs (60,000-90,000 USP) of lipase activity in the prandial and postprandial period-i
level that is sufficient to reduce steatorrhea to a clinically insignificant level in most cases. Suboptimal response to enteric-coated formulations may be due to poor mixing of granules with food or slow dissolution and release enzymes. Gradual increase of dose, change to a different formulation, or addition of acid suppression therapy may improve response.

Pancreatic enzyme supplements are well tolerated. The capsules should be swallowed, not chewed, as pancreal enzymes may cause oropharyngeal mucositis. Excessive doses may cause diarrhea and abdominal pain. The hị purine content of pancreas extracts may lead to hyperuricosuria and renal stones. Several cases of colonic strictures were reported in patients with cystic fibrosis who received high doses of pancrelipase with high lipase activity. These high-dose formulations have since been removed from the market.

\section*{BILE ACID THERAPY FOR GALLSTONES}

Ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid) is a naturally occurring bile acid that makes up less than $5 \%$ of the circulating bile salt pool in humans and a much higher percentage in bears. After oral administration, it is absorbed, conjugated in the liver with glycine or taurine, and excreted in the bile. Conjugated ursodiol undergoes extensi enterohepatic recirculation. The serum half-life is approximately 100 hours. With long-term daily administration ursodiol constitutes 30-50\% of the circulating bile acid pool. A small amount of unabsorbed conjugated or unconjugated ursodiol passes into the colon where it is either excreted or undergoes dehydroxylation by colonic bacteria to lithocholic acid, a substance with potential hepatic toxicity.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

The solubility of cholesterol in bile is determined by the relative proportions of bile acids, lecithin, and cholesterol. Although prolonged ursodiol therapy expands the bile acid pool, this does not appear to be the principal mechanism of action for dissolution of gallstones. Ursodiol decreases the cholesterol content of bile by reducing hepatic cholesterol secretion. Ursodiol also appears to stabilize hepatocyte canalicular membranes, possibly through a reduction in the concentration of other endogenous bile acids or through inhibition of immun mediated hepatocyte destruction.

\section*{Clinical Use}

Ursodiol is used for dissolution of small cholesterol gallstones in patients with symptomatic gallbladder disease who refuse cholecystectomy or who are poor surgical candidates. At a dosage of $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ for $12-24$ months dissolution occurs in up to half of patients with small ( $<5-10 \mathrm{~mm}$ ) noncalcified gallstones. It is also effective fo the prevention of gallstones in obese patients undergoing rapid weight loss therapy. Several trials demonstrate that ursodiol $13-15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ is helpful for patients with early-stage primary biliary cirrhosis, reducing liver function abnormalities and improving liver histology.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Ursodiol is practically free of serious adverse effects. Bile salt-induced diarrhea is uncommon. Unlike its predecessor, chenodeoxycholate, ursodiol has not been associated with hepatotoxicity.

\section*{DRUGS USED TO TREAT VARI CEAL HEMORRHAGE}

Portal hypertension most commonly occurs as a consequence of chronic liver disease. Portal hypertension is caused by increased blood flow within the portal venous system and increased resistance to portal flow within the liver. Splanchnic blood flow is increased in patients with cirrhosis due to low arteriolar resistance that is
mediated by increased circulating vasodilators and decreased vascular sensitivity to vasoconstrictors. Intrahepatic resistance to blood flow is increased in cirrhosis due to fixed fibrosis within the spaces of Disse and hepatic veins as well as reversible vasoconstriction of hepatic sinusoids and venules. Among the consequences portal hypertension are ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and the development of portosystemic collaterals—especially gastric or esophageal varices. Varices can rupture, leading to massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Several drugs are available that reduce portal pressures. These may be used in the short term for the treatmer of active variceal hemorrhage or long term to reduce the risk of hemorrhage.

\section*{SOMATOSTATI N \& OCTREOTI DE}

The pharmacology of octreotide is discussed above under Antidiarrheal Agents. In patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, intravenous somatostatin ( $250 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{h}$ ) or octreotide ( $50 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{h}$ ) reduces portal blood flow and variceal pressures; however, the mechanism by which they do so is poorly understood. They do not appear to induce direct contraction of vascular smooth muscle. Their activity may be mediated through inhibition of release of glucagon and other gut peptides that alter mesenteric blood flow. Although data from clinical trials ar conflicting, these agents are probably effective in promoting initial hemostasis from bleeding esophageal varice They are generally administered for 3-5 days.

\section*{VASOPRESSI N \& TERLI PRESSI N}

Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) is a polypeptide hormone secreted by the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary. Its pharmacology is discussed in Chapters 17 and 37. Although its primary physiologic role is to maintain serum osmolality, it is also a potent arterial vasoconstrictor. When administered intravenously by continuous infusion, it causes splanchnic arterial vasoconstriction that leads to reduced splanchnic perfusion an lowered portal venous pressures. Prior to the advent of octreotide, vasopressin was commonly used to treat acute variceal hemorrhage. However, because of its high adverse effect profile, it is no longer used for this purpose. In contrast, for patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding from small bowel or large bowel vascular ectasias or diverticulosis, vasopressin may be infused-to promote vasospasm-into one of the branches of the superior or inferior mesenteric artery through an angiographically placed catheter. Adverse effects with systemi vasopressin are common. Systemic and peripheral vasoconstriction can lead to hypertension, myocardial ischemia or infarction, or mesenteric infarction. These effects may be reduced by coadministration of nitroglycerin, which may further reduce portal venous pressures (by reducing portohepatic vascular resistance) and may also reduce the coronary and peripheral vascular vasospasm caused by vasopressin. Other common adverse effects are nausea, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea (due to intestinal hyperactivity). Furthermore, the antidiuretic effects of vasopressin promote retention of free water, which can lead to hyponatremia, fluid retention, and pulmonary edema.

Terlipressin is a vasopressin analog that appears to have similar efficacy to vasopressin with fewer adverse effects. Although this agent is available in other countries, it is still undergoing clinical testing in the USA.

\section*{BETA-RECEPTOR- BLOCKI NG DRUGS}

The pharmacology of these agents is discussed in Chapter 10. Beta-receptor antagonists reduce portal venous pressures via a decrease in portal venous inflow. This decrease is due to a decrease in cardiac output ( $B_{1}$ blockade) and to splanchnic vasoconstriction ( $B_{2}$ blockade) caused by the unopposed effect of systemic catecholamines on areceptors. Thus, nonselective Bblockers such as propranolol and nadolol are more effective
than selective $B_{1}$ blockers in reducing portal pressures. Among patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices who have not previously had an episode of variceal hemorrhage, the incidence of bleeding among patient treat! with nonselective Bblockers is $15 \%$ compared with $25 \%$ in control groups. Among patients with a history of variceal hemorrhage, the likelihood of recurrent hemorrhage is $80 \%$ within 2 years. Nonselective Bblockers significantly reduce the rate of recurrent bleeding, although a reduction in mortality is unproved.

\section*{I NTRODUCTI ON: THERAPEUTIC \& TOXIC POTENTI AL OF OVER-THECOUNTER AGENTS}

In the USA, drugs are divided by law into two classes: those restricted to sale by prescription only and those for which directions for safe use by the public can be written. The latter category constitutes the nonprescription or over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. In 2004, the American public spent more than $\$ 15$ billion on over 100,000 OTC products to medicate themselves for ailments ranging from acne to warts. These products contain approximately 1000 active ingredients in various forms and combinations.

It is apparent that many OTC drugs are no more than "me too" products advertised to the public in ways that suggest significant differences between them. For example, there are over 100 different systemic analgesic products, almost all of which contain aspirin, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, or a combination of these agents as primary ingredients. They are made different from one another by the addition of questionable ingredients such as caffeine or antihistamines; by brand names chosen to suggest a specific use or strength ("women's," "migraine," "arthritis," "maximum"); or by special dosage formulations (enteric-coated tablets, geltabs, liquids, sustained-release products, powders, seltzers). There is a price attached to all of these features, and in most cases a less expensive generic product can be equally effective. It is probably safe to assume that the public is generally overwhelmed and confused by the wide array of products presented and will probably use those that are most heavily advertised.

Over the past 30 years, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been engaged in a methodical review of OTC ingredients for both safety and efficacy. There have been two major outcomes of this review: (1) Ingredients designated as ineffective or unsafe for their claimed therapeutic use are being eliminated from OTC product formulations (eg, antimuscarinic agents have been eliminated from OTC sleep aids, attapulgite and polycarbophil can no longer be marketed as OTC antidiarrheal products); and (2) agents previously available by prescription only have been made available for OTC use because they were judged by the review panel to be generally safe and effective for consumer use without medical supervision (Table 64-1). Since the appointment of the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee in 1993, the rate of switches from prescription to OTC status has accelerated. Indeed, more than 700 OTC products contain ingredients and dosages that were available only by prescription less than 30 years ago. Some agents such as docosanol and the nicotine polacrilex lozenge have bypassed the prescription route altogether and have been released directly to the OTC market. Other OTC ingredients previously available in low doses only are now available in higherstrength formulations. Examples of other prescription drugs currently under consideration for OTC reclassification are orlistat for weight loss, and second-generation nonsedating antihistamines (cetirizine, fexofenadine) for relief of allergy and cold symptoms. The prescription to OTC reclassification process is very rigorous, and many agents have not been approved for OTC use. For example, the cholesterol-lowering agents cholestyramine, lovastatin, and pravastatin were denied OTC status on the basis that these agents could not be used safely and effectively in an OTC setting. The advisory committee believed that diagnosis and ongoing management by a health care provider was necessary for the management of hyperlipidemia, a chronic, asymptomatic condition with potentially life-threatening consequences. In a similar recommendation, oral acyclovir for OTC use in
the treatment of recurrent genital herpes was not approved because of concerns about misdiagnosis and inappropriate use leading to increased viral resistance.

There are three reasons why it is essential for clinicians to be familiar with the OTC class of products. First, many OTC medications are effective in treating common ailments, and it is important to be able to help the patient select a safe, effective product. Because managed-care practices encourage clinicians to limit the cost of drugs they prescribe, many will begin to recommend effective OTC treatments to their patients, since these drugs are rarely paid for by the insurance plan (Table 64-2). Second, many of the active ingredients contained in OTC drugs may worsen existing medical conditions or interact with prescription medications. (See Appendix II, Drug Interactions.) Finally, the misuse or abuse of OTC products may actually produce significant medical complications.
Phenylpropanolamine, for example, a sympathomimetic previously found in many cold, allergy, and weight control products, was withdrawn from the United States market by the FDA several years ago
based on reports that the drug increased the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Pseudoephedrine, a decongestant contained in numerous OTC cold preparations has been used in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine. A general awareness of these products and their formulations will enable clinicians to more fully appreciate the potential for OTC drug-related problems in their patients.

Table 64-2 lists examples of OTC products that may be used effectively to treat common medical problems. The selection of one ingredient over another may be important in patients with certain medical conditions or in patients taking other medications. These are discussed in detail in other chapters. The recommendations listed in Table 64-2 are based on the efficacy of the ingredients and on the principles set forth in the following paragraphs.
(1) Select the product that is simplest in formulation with regard to ingredients and dosage form. In general, single-ingredient products are preferred. Although some combination products contain effective doses of all ingredients, others contain therapeutic doses of some ingredients and subtherapeutic doses of others. Furthermore, there may be differing durations of action among the ingredients, and there is always a possibility that the clinician or patient is unaware of the presence of certain active ingredients in the product. Acetaminophen, for example, is in many cough and cold preparations; a patient unaware of this may take separate doses of analgesic in addition to that contained in the cold preparation, potentially leading to toxicity.
(2) Select a product that contains a therapeutically effective dose.
(3) Carefully read the product labeling to determine which ingredients are appropriate based on the patient's symptoms and underlying health conditions and whatever is known about the medications the patient is already taking.
(4) Recommend a generic product if one is available.
(5) Be wary of "gimmicks" or advertising claims of specific superiority over similar products.
(6) For children, the dose, dosage form, and palatability of the product are prime considerations.

Certain ingredients in OTC products should be avoided or used with caution in selected patients because they may exacerbate existing medical problems or interact with other medications the patient is taking. Many of the more potent OTC ingredients are hidden in products where their presence would not ordinarily be expected (Table 64-3). Although OTC medications have standardized label formatting and content requirements that specify the indications for use, dosage, warnings, and active and inactive ingredients contained in the product, many consumers do not carefully read or comprehend this information. Lack of awareness of the ingredients in OTC products and the belief by many physicians that OTC products are ineffective and harmless may cause diagnostic confusion and perhaps interfere with therapy. For example, innumerable OTC products, including analgesics and allergy, cough, and cold preparations, contain sympathomimetics. These agents should be avoided or used cautiously by type 1 diabetics and patients with hypertension, angina, or hyperthyroidism. Aspirin should not be used in children and adolescents for viral infections (with or without fever) because of an increased risk of Reye's syndrome. Aspirin and other NSAIDs should be avoided by individuals with active peptic ulcer disease, certain platelet disorders, and patients taking oral anticoagulants. Cimetidine, an $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-receptor antagonist, is a well-known inhibitor of hepatic drug metabolism and can increase the blood levels and toxicity of drugs such as phenytoin, theophylline, and warfarin.

Overuse or misuse of OTC products may induce significant medical problems. A prime example is rebound congestion from the regular use of decongestant nasal sprays for more than 3 days. The improper and long-term use of some antacids (eg, aluminum hydroxide) may cause constipation and even impaction in elderly people, as well as hypophosphatemia. Laxative abuse can result in abdominal cramping and fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Insomnia, nervousness, and restlessness can result from the use of sympathomimetics or caffeine hidden in many OTC products (Table 64-3). The long-term use of some analgesics containing large amounts of caffeine may produce rebound headaches, and long-term use of analgesics has been associated with interstitial nephritis. OTC products containing aspirin, other salicylates, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, or ketoprofen may increase the risk of hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal hemorrhage in individuals who consume three or more alcoholic drinks daily. Recent evidence suggests the long-term use of NSAIDs may increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. Furthermore, acute ingestion of large amounts of acetaminophen by adults or children can cause serious, and often fatal, hepatotoxicity. Antihistamines may cause sedation or drowsiness, especially when taken concurrently with sedativehypnotics, tranquilizers, alcohol, or other central nervous system depressants. Finally, antihistamines, local anesthetics, antimicrobial agents, counterirritants, p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and preservatives contained in a myriad of OTC topical and vaginal products may induce allergic reactions.

There are three major drug information sources for OTC products. Handbook of Nonprescription Drugs is the most comprehensive resource for OTC medications; it evaluates ingredients contained in major OTC drug classes and lists the ingredients included in many OTC products. Nonprescription Drug Therapy is an annually updated reference that provides detailed OTC product information and patient counseling instructions. Physicians' Desk Reference for Nonprescription Drugs, Dietary Supplements and Herbs, a compendium of manufacturers' information regarding OTC products, is published annually but is somewhat incomplete with regard to the number of products included. Any health care provider who seeks more specific information regarding OTC products may find useful the references listed below.

\section*{BOTANI CALS ("HERBAL MEDI CATI ONS") \& NUTRITI ONAL SUPPLEMENTS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

The medical use of botanicals in their natural and unprocessed form undoubtedly began when the first intelligent animals noticed that certain food plants altered particular body functions. Much information exists about the historical use and effectiveness of botanical products. Unfortunately, the quality of this information is extremely variable and much is useless or false. An unbiased and regularly updated compendium of basic and clinical reports regarding botanicals is Pharmacists Letter/Prescribers Letter Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database (see references). A useful evidence-based website, www.naturalstandard.com, is available to institutions. Another compendium is the Report of the German Commission E (a committee that sets standards for herbal medications in that country). Interest in the endocrine effects and possible nutritional benefits of certain purified chemicals such as glucosamine, melatonin, high-dose vitamins, and minerals has led to a parallel development of consumer demand for such substances.

The alternative medicinal substances are distinguished from similar botanical substances used in traditional medicine (morphine, digitalis, atropine, etc) by virtue of being available without a prescription and, unlike over-the-counter medications, being legally considered dietary supplements rather than drugs (thus avoiding conventional Food and Drug Administration oversight). Among the purified chemicals, glucosamine and melatonin are of significant pharmacologic interest.

This chapter provides an evidence-based approach to the pharmacology and clinical efficacy of several of the commonly used and commercially available botanicals and dietary supplements. Ephedrine, the active principle in Ma-huang, is discussed in Chapter 9.

\section*{REGULATORY FACTORS}

Dietary supplements (which include vitamins, minerals, cofactors, herbal medications, and amino acids) are not considered over-the-counter drugs in the USA but rather food supplements. In 1994, the United States Congress, influenced by growing "consumerism" as well as strong manufacturer lobbying efforts, passed the Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act (DSHEA). This misguided act prevented adequate FDA oversight of these substances. Thus, DSHEA has allowed a variety of substances with pharmacologic activity-if classified as dietary supplements-to be sold without a prescription or any FDA review of efficacy or safety prior to product marketing. Dietary supplements are governed under Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packaging or Holding Human Food (CGMP) regulations. Although administered by the FDA, CGMP regulations are often inadequate to ensure product purity, potency, and other variables such as accurate product identification and appropriate botanical harvesting. Therefore, much of the criticism regarding the dietary supplement industry involves a lack of product purity and variations in potency.

\section*{CLI NI CAL ASPECTS OF THE USE OF BOTANI CALS}

Many United States consumers have embraced the use of botanicals and other supplements as a "natural" approach to their health care. Unfortunately, misconceptions regarding safety and efficacy
of the agents are common, and the fact that a substance can be called "natural" of course does not guarantee its safety. In fact, these products can be adulterated, misbranded, or contaminated either intentionally or unintentionally in a variety of ways. Furthermore, the doses recommended for active botanical substances may be much higher than those considered clinically safe. For example, the doses recommended for several Ma-huang preparations contain three to five times the medically recommended daily dose of the active ingredient, ephedrine-doses that impose significant risks for patients with cardiovascular disease.

Adverse effects have been documented for a variety of botanical medications. Unfortunately, chemical analysis is rarely performed on the products involved. This leads to uncertainty about whether the primary herb or an adulterant caused the adverse effect. In some cases, the chemical constituents of the herb can clearly lead to toxicity. Some of the herbs that should be used cautiously or not at all are listed in Table 65-1.

\section*{ECHI NACEA (ECHI NACEA PURPUREA)}

\section*{Chemistry}

The three most widely used species of Echinacea are Echinacea purpurea, E pallida, and E angustifolia. The chemical constituents include flavonoids, lipophilic constituents (eg, alkamides, polyacetylenes), water-soluble polysaccharides, and water-soluble caffeoyl conjugates (eg,
echinacoside, chicoric acid, caffeic acid). Within any marketed echinacea formulation, the relative amounts of these components are dependent upon the species used, the method of manufacture, and the plant parts used. The German Commission E has approved two formulations for clinical use: the fresh pressed juice of aerial parts of E purpurea and the alcoholic root extract of E pallida. E purpurea has been the most widely studied in clinical trials. Although the active constituents of echinacea are not completely known, chicoric acid from E purpurea and echinacoside from E pallida and E angustifolia, as well as alkamides and polysaccharides, are most often noted as having immune-modulating properties. Most commercial formulations, however, are not standardized for any particular constituent.

\section*{Pharmacologic Effects}

\section*{IMMUNE MODULATION}

The effect of echinacea on the immune system is controversial. Human studies using commercially marketed formulations of echinacea have shown increased phagocytosis but not immunostimulation. In vitro, however, E purpurea juice increased production of interleukin-1, -6, -10, and tumor necrosis factor-a. by human macrophages. Enhanced natural killer cell activity and antibody-dependent cellular toxicity was also observed with E purpurea extract in cell lines from both healthy and immunocompromised patients. Studies using the isolated purified polysaccharides from E purpurea have also shown cytokine activation. Polysaccharides by themselves, however, are unlikely to accurately reproduce the activity of the entire extract.

\section*{ANTI-I NFLAMMATORY EFFECTS}

Certain echinacea constituents have demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in vitro. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase, and hyaluronidase may be involved. In animals, application of E purpurea prior to application of a topical irritant reduced both paw and ear edema. There are too few clinical trials in humans to warrant the use of echinacea in wound healing.

\section*{ANTI BACTERI AL, ANTI FUNGAL, ANTI VI RAL, AND ANTI OXI DANT EFFECTS}

Some in vitro studies have reported weak antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antioxidant activity with echinacea constituents. The applicability of these findings to clinical trials is discussed below.

\section*{Clinical Trials}

Echinacea is most often used to enhance immune function in individuals who have colds and other respiratory tract infections. Older reviews and cold treatment trials reported favorable results for the aerial parts of E purpurea in reducing symptoms or time to recovery if the agent was administered within the first 24 hours of a cold. To date, however, most of these trials have contained multiple variables (eg, formulation, dose, duration) that make it difficult to make a clear therapeutic recommendation or ensure reproducible outcomes. At best, symptoms and duration may be reduced by about $25-30 \%$. Recent trials investigating preparations of E angustifolia and combinations of echinacea containing E angustifolia for cold treatment, however, have failed to find a benefit. Echinacea has also been evaluated as a prophylactic agent in the prevention of upper respiratory tract infection in adults and as a treatment and prophylactic agent for colds in children. These trials have generally reported no effect.

Echinacea has been used investigationally to enhance hematologic recovery following chemotherapy. It has also been used as an adjunct in the treatment of urinary tract and vaginal fungal infections.

These indications require further research before they can be accepted in clinical practice. E purpurea is ineffective in treating recurrent genital herpes.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Flu-like symptoms (eg, fever, shivering, headache, vomiting) have been reported following the intravenous use of echinacea extracts. Adverse effects with oral commercial formulations are minimal and most often include unpleasant taste, gastrointestinal upset, or central nervous system effects (eg, headache, dizziness). Allergic reactions such as rash, acute asthma, and anaphylaxis have been infrequently reported.

\section*{Drug I nteractions \& Precautions}

Until the role of echinacea in immune modulation is better defined, this agent should be avoided in patients with immune deficiency disorders (eg, AIDS, cancer), autoimmune disorders (eg, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis), and patients with tuberculosis. The German Commission E recommends limiting the chronic use of echinacea to no more than 8 weeks. While there are no reported drug interactions for echinacea, some preparations have a high alcohol content and should not be used with medications known to cause a disulfiram-like reaction. Theoretically echinacea should also be avoided in persons taking immunosuppressant medications (eg, organ transplant recipients).

\section*{Dosage}

Because of recent negative trials using E angustifolia for colds and a lack of clinical trials examining E pallida, only the dosing for E purpurea is provided here. E purpurea freshly pressed juice is given at a dosage of $6-9 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{d}$ in divided doses two to five times daily. Echinacea is generally taken at the first sign of a cold.

The pharmacologic activity of garlic involves a variety of organosulfur compounds. The most notable of these is allicin, which is responsible for the characteristic garlic odor.

\section*{Pharmacologic Effects}

\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS}

In vitro, allicin and related compounds inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, which is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (see Chapter 35). Several clinical trials have investigated the lipid-lowering potential of garlic. Some have shown significant reductions in cholesterol and others no effect. The most recent meta-analysis suggested a minor ( $5 \%$ ) reduction of total cholesterol that was insignificant when dietary controls were in place. Results of a study by the National Center of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) evaluating three different sources of garlic (fresh, powdered, and aged garlic extract) in adults with moderately elevated cholesterol are likely to be published in 2006 and may provide further insight into the efficacy of this botanical for this indication.

Clinical trials report antiplatelet effects (possibly through inhibition of thromboxane synthesis) following garlic ingestion and mixed effects on fibrinolytic activity. These effects in combination with antioxidant effects (eg, increased resistance to low-density lipoprotein oxidation) and reductions in
total cholesterol may be beneficial in patients with atherosclerosis. In preliminary trials involving atherosclerotic patients, significant reductions in plaque volume were observed for patients taking garlic versus placebo.

Garlic constituents may affect blood vessel elasticity and blood pressure. Proposed mechanisms include opening of potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle, stimulation of nitric oxide synthesis, and inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme. Epidemiologic studies suggest that individuals chronically consuming low doses of garlic (averaging $460 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) may have reductions in aortic stiffness. A meta-analysis of garlic's antihypertensive properties revealed a mild effect with a 7.7 mm Hg decrease in systolic pressure and a 5 mm Hg decrease in diastolic pressure.

\section*{ENDOCRINE EFFECTS}

The effect of garlic on glucose homeostasis does not appear to be significant in persons with diabetes. Certain organosulfur constituents in garlic, however, have demonstrated hypoglycemic effects in nondiabetic animal models.

\section*{ANTI MI CROBI AL EFFECTS}

In vitro, allicin has demonstrated activity against some gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi (Candida albicans), protozoa (Entamoeba histolytica), and certain viruses. The primary mechanism involves the inhibition of thiol-containing enzymes needed by these microbes. The antimicrobial effect of garlic has not been extensively studied in clinical trials. Given the availability of effective prescription antimicrobials, the usefulness of garlic in this area appears limited.

\section*{ANTI NEOPLASTIC EFFECTS}

In rodent studies, garlic inhibits procarcinogens for colon, esophageal, lung, breast, and stomach cancer, probably by detoxification of carcinogens and reduced carcinogen activation. The evidence for anticarcinogenic properties in vivo is largely epidemiologic. For example, certain populations with high dietary garlic consumption appear to have a reduced incidence of stomach cancer.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Following oral ingestion, adverse effects may include nausea (6\%), hypotension (1.3\%), allergy ( $1.1 \%$ ), and bleeding (rare). Breath odor has been reported with an incidence of $20-40 \%$ at recommended doses using enteric-coated formulations. Contact dermatitis may occur with the handling of raw garlic.

\section*{Drug I nteractions \& Precautions}

Because of reported antiplatelet effects, patients using anticlotting medications (eg, warfarin, aspirin, ibuprofen) should use garlic cautiously. Additional monitoring of blood pressure and signs and symptoms of bleeding is warranted. Garlic may reduce the bioavailability of saquinavir, an antiviral protease inhibitor, but it does not appear to affect the bioavailability of ritonavir.

\section*{Dosage}

Products should be standardized to contain 1.3\% alliin (the allicin precursor) or have an allicingenerating potential of $0.6 \%$. Enteric-coated formulations are recommended to minimize degradation of the active substances. A daily dose of $600-900 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ of powdered garlic is most common. This is equivalent to one clove of raw garlic ( $2-4 \mathrm{~g}$ ) per day.

\section*{GI NKGO (GI NKGO BI LOBA)}

\section*{Chemistry}

Ginkgo biloba extract is prepared from the leaves of the ginkgo tree. The most common formulation is prepared by concentrating 50 parts of the crude leaf to prepare one part of extract. The active constituents in ginkgo are flavone glycosides and terpenoids (ie, ginkgolides A, B, C, J, and bilobalide).

\section*{Pharmacologic Effects}

\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS}

In animal models and some human studies, ginkgo has been shown to increase blood flow and reduce blood viscosity, thus enhancing tissue perfusion. Enhancement of endogenous nitric oxide (see Chapter 19) and antagonism of platelet-activating factor may be involved.

Ginkgo biloba has been studied for its effects on mild to moderate occlusive peripheral arterial disease. Randomized studies involving $120-160 \mathrm{mg}$ of standardized ginkgo leaf extract (EGb761) for up to 6 months have generally reported significant improvements in pain-free walking distance as compared with placebo. Efficacy may be comparable to pentoxyfylline (see Chapter 20) for this indication. (It should be noted that physical conditioning is as effective as pentoxyfylline in improving walking distance.)

\section*{METABOLIC EFFECTS}

Antioxidant and radical-scavenging properties have been observed for the flavonoid fraction of ginkgo as well as some of the terpene constituents. In vitro, ginkgo has demonstrated superoxide dismutase-like activity and superoxide anion- and hydroxyl radical-scavenging properties. It has also demonstrated a protective effect in limiting free radical formation in animal models of ischemic injury and in reducing markers of oxidative stress in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery.

\section*{CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM EFFECTS}

In aged animal models, chronic administration of ginkgo for 3-4 weeks led to modifications in central nervous system receptors and neurotransmitters. Receptor densities increased for muscarinic, $a_{2}$, and $5-\mathrm{HT}_{1 \mathrm{a}}$ receptors and decreased for Badrenoceptors. Increased serum levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine and enhanced synaptosomal reuptake of serotonin have also been reported. Additional mechanisms that may be involved include reversible inhibition of monoamine (MAO) A and B, reduced corticosterone synthesis, inhibition of amyloid-beta fibril formation, and enhanced GABA levels.

Ginkgo is frequently used to treat cerebral insufficiency and dementia of the Alzheimer type. The term cerebral insufficiency, however, includes a variety of manifestations ranging from poor concentration and confusion to anxiety and depression as well as physical complaints such as hearing loss and headache. For this reason, studies evaluating cerebral insufficiency tend to be more inclusive and difficult to assess than trials evaluating dementia. A meta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration found that ginkgo showed promising evidence for improvement of cognitive function in patients with cognitive impairment and dementia. The duration of the largest of these studies was 1 year. Recent studies on the effects of ginkgo for memory enhancement in healthy nondemented elderly adults did not show a benefit with 6 weeks of use. Ginkgo is currently under investigation as a prophylactic agent for dementia of the Alzheimer type.

\section*{MISCELLANEOUS EFFECTS}

Ginkgo has been studied for its effects in allergic and asthmatic bronchoconstriction, erectile dysfunction, tinnitus and hearing loss, short-term memory loss in healthy nonelderly adults, and macular degeneration. In all of these conditions, the evidence is insufficient to warrant clinical use at this time.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Adverse effects have been reported with a frequency comparable to that of placebo. These include nausea, headache, stomach upset, diarrhea, allergy, anxiety, and insomnia. A few case reports noted bleeding complications in patients using ginkgo. In a few of these cases, the patients were also using either aspirin or warfarin.

\section*{Drug I nteractions \& Precautions}

Ginkgo may have antiplatelet properties and should not be used in combination with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications. A case of an enhanced sedative effect was reported when ginkgo was combined with trazodone. Seizures have been reported as a toxic effect of ginkgo, most likely related to seed contamination in the leaf formulations. Ginkgo seeds are epileptogenic. Ginkgo formulations should be avoided in individuals with preexisting seizure disorders.

\section*{Dosage}

Ginkgo biloba dried leaf extract should be standardized to contain $24 \%$ flavone glycosides and $6 \%$ terpene lactones. Products should be concentrated to a $50: 1$ ratio. The daily dose ranges from $120-240 \mathrm{mg}$ of the dried extract in two or three divided doses. Onset of effect may require 2-4 weeks.

\section*{GINSENG}

\section*{Chemistry}

Ginseng botanical preparations may be derived from any of several species of the genus Panax. Of these, crude preparations or extracts of Panax ginseng, the Chinese or Korean variety, and P quinquefolium, the American variety, are most often available to consumers in the United States. The active principles appear to be a dozen or more triterpenoid saponin glycosides called ginsenosides or panaxosides. It is recommended that commercial P ginseng formulations be standardized to contain 4-7\% ginsenosides.

Other plant materials are commonly sold under the name ginseng but are not from Panax species. These include Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus) and Brazilian ginseng (Pfaffia paniculata). Of these, Siberian ginseng is more widely available in the USA. Siberian ginseng contains eleutherosides but no ginsenosides. Currently, there is no recommended standardization for eleutheroside content in Siberian ginseng products.

\section*{Pharmacology}

An extensive literature exists on the potential pharmacologic effects of ginsenosides. Unfortunately, the studies differ widely in the species of Panax used, the ginsenosides studied, the degree of purification applied to the extracts, the animal species studied, and the measurements used to
evaluate the responses. Some of the more commonly reported beneficial pharmacologic effects include modulation of immune function, ergogenic ("energizing") activity, nootropic ("mindenhancing") activity, antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory effects, antistress activity (ie, stimulation of pituitary-adrenocortical system), analgesia, vasoregulatory effects, antiplatelet activity, improved glucose homeostasis, and anticancer properties.

\section*{Clinical Trials}

Ginseng is most often used to help improve physical and mental performance. Unfortunately, the clinical trials are of small sample size and report either an improvement in mental function and physical performance or no effect. Some randomized controlled trials evaluating "quality of life" have claimed significant benefits in some subscale measures of quality of life but rarely in overall composite scores using P ginseng. Better results have been observed with P quinquefolium in lowering postprandial glucose indices in subjects with and without diabetes. Newer trials have shown some immunomodulating benefits of P quinquefolium and P ginseng in preventing upper respiratory tract infections. Epidemiologic studies have suggested a reduction in several types of cancer with P ginseng. Systematic reviews, however, have generally failed to find conclusive evidence for the use of P ginseng for any particular condition. Until better clinical studies are published, no recommendation can be made regarding the use of P ginseng or P quinquefolium for any specific indication.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

A variety of adverse effects have been reported. Weak estrogenic properties may cause the vaginal bleeding and mastalgia reported by some patients. Central nervous system stimulation (eg, insomnia, nervousness) and hypertension have been reported in patients using high doses (more than $3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ ) of P ginseng. Methylxanthines found in the ginseng plant may contribute to this effect. The German Commission E lists high blood pressure as a contraindication to the use of Siberian ginseng but not P ginseng.

\section*{Drug I nteractions \& Precautions}

Irritability, sleeplessness, and manic behavior have been reported in psychiatric patients using ginseng in combination with other medications (phenelzine, lithium, neuroleptics). Ginseng should be used cautiously in patients taking any psychiatric, estrogenic, or hypoglycemic medications. Ginseng has antiplatelet properties and should not be used in combination with warfarin. Similar to echinacea, cytokine stimulation has been observed for both P ginseng and P quinquefolium, necessitating cautious use in individuals who are immunocompromised, are taking immune stimulants or suppressants, or have autoimmune disorders.

\section*{Dosing}

The German Commission E recommends $1-2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ of crude $P$ ginseng root or its equivalent. Two hundred milligrams of ginseng extract is equivalent to 1 g of the crude root. Ginsana has been used as a standardized extract in some clinical trials and is available in the USA. Dosing for Siberian ginseng is $2-3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ of the crude root.

\section*{MI LK THI STLE (SI LYBUM MARI ANUM)}

\section*{Chemistry}

The fruit and seeds of the milk thistle plant contain a lipophilic mixture of flavonolignans known as silymarin. Silymarin comprises 2-3\% of the dried herb and is composed of three primary isomers, silybin (also known as silybinin or silibinin), silychristin (silichristin), and silydianin (silidianin). Silybin is the most prevalent and potent of the three isomers and accounts for about $50 \%$ of the silymarin complex. Products should be standardized to contain 70-80\% silymarin.

\section*{Pharmacologic Effects}

\section*{LIVER DISEASE}

In animal models, milk thistle limits hepatic injury associated with a variety of toxins, including Amanita mushrooms, galactosamine, carbon tetrachloride, acetaminophen, radiation, cold ischemia, and ethanol. In vitro studies and some in vivo studies demonstrate that silymarin reduces lipid peroxidation, scavenges free radicals, and enhances glutathione and superoxide dismutase levels. This may contribute to membrane stabilization and reduce toxin entry.

Milk thistle appears to have anti-inflammatory properties. In vitro, silybin strongly and noncompetitively inhibits lipoxygenase and leukotriene formation. Inhibition of leukocyte migration has been observed in vivo and may be a factor when acute inflammation is present. Silymarin also inhibits tumor necrosis factor-ar-mediated activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), which promotes inflammatory responses. One of the most unusual mechanisms claimed for milk thistle involves an increase in RNA polymerase I activity in nonmalignant hepatocytes but not in hepatoma or other malignant cell lines. By increasing this enzyme's activity, enhanced protein synthesis and cellular regeneration may occur in diseased but not malignant cells. Milk thistle may have a role in hepatic fibrosis. In an animal model of cirrhosis, it reduced collagen accumulation, and in an in vitro model it reduced expression of the profibrogenic cytokine transforming growth factor- $B$.

It has been suggested that milk thistle may be beneficial in the management of hypercholesterolemia and gallstones. A small trial in humans showed a reduction in bile saturation index and biliary cholesterol concentration. The latter may reflect a reduction in liver cholesterol synthesis. To date, however, there is insufficient evidence to warrant the use of milk thistle for these indications.

\section*{CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC EFFECTS}

Preliminary in vitro and animal studies have been carried out with skin, lung, bladder, colon, tongue, breast, and prostate cancer cell lines. In murine models of skin cancer, silybinin and milk thistle reduced tumor initiation and promotion. It also inhibited cell growth and proliferation by inducing a $\mathrm{G}_{1}$ cell cycle arrest in cultured human breast and prostate cancer cell lines. However, the use of milk thistle in the treatment of cancer has not yet been adequately studied and should not be recommended to patients.

\section*{Clinical Trials}

Milk thistle has been used to treat acute and chronic viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and toxininduced liver injury in human patients. A recent systematic review of 13 randomized trials involving 915 patients with alcoholic liver disease or hepatitis B or C found no significant reductions in all-cause mortality, liver histology, or complications of liver disease. A significant reduction in liver-related mortality among all trials was documented, but not among trials of better design and controls. It was concluded that the effects of milk thistle in improving liver function or mortality from liver disease are currently poorly substantiated. Until additional well-designed clinical trials (possibly exploring higher
doses) can be performed, a clinical effect can be neither supported nor ruled out.
Milk thistle has not been well studied in humans as an antidote following acute exposure to liver toxins. Parenteral silybin, however, is marketed and used in Europe as an antidote in Amanita phalloides mushroom poisoning, based on favorable outcomes reported in case-control studies.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Milk thistle has rarely been reported to cause adverse effects when used at recommended dosage. In clinical trials, the incidence of adverse effects (eg, gastrointestinal upset, dermatologic, headaches) was comparable to that of placebo.

\section*{Drug Interactions, Precautions, \& Dosing}

There are no reported drug-drug interactions or precautions for milk thistle. Recommended dosage is $280-420 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, calculated as silybin, in three divided doses.

\section*{ST. JOHN'S WORT (HYPERI CUM PERFORATUM)}

\section*{Chemistry}

St. John's wort, also known as hypericum, contains a variety of constituents that may contribute to its pharmacologic activity. Hypericin, a marker of standardization for currently marketed products, was thought to be the primary antidepressant constituent. Recent attention has focused on hyperforin, but a combination of several compounds is probably involved. Commercial formulations are usually prepared by soaking the dried chopped flowers in methanol to create a hydroalcoholic extract that is then dried.

\section*{Pharmacologic Effects}

\section*{ANTI-DEPRESSANT ACTION}

The hypericin fraction was initially reported to have MAO-A and -B inhibitor properties. Later studies found that the concentration required for this inhibition was higher than that which could be achieved with recommended dosages. In vitro studies using the commercially formulated hydroalcoholic extract have shown inhibition of nerve terminal reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. While the hypericin constituent did not show reuptake inhibition for any of these systems, a concentrated hyperforin extract did. Chronic administration of the commercial extract has also been shown to significantly down-regulate the expression of cortical Badrenoceptors and up-regulate the expression of serotonin receptors ( $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ ) in a rodent model.

Other effects observed in vitro include opioid sigma receptor binding using the hypericin fraction and GABA receptor binding using the commercial extract. Interleukin-6 production is also reduced in the presence of the extract.

The most systematic review and meta-analysis, which involved 37 randomized controlled trials, demonstrated that St. John's wort is more efficacious than placebo and as efficacious as some prescription antidepressants for mild to moderate depression. Efficacy for more severe depression, however, is still in question. Most trials used doses of St. John's wort ranging from $900 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ (for mild to moderate depression) to $1800 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ (for severe depression) and lasted $4-8$ weeks.

\section*{ANTIVIRAL AND ANTICARCINOGENIC EFFECTS}

The hypericin constituent of St. John's wort is photolabile and can be activated by exposure to certain wavelengths of visible or ultraviolet A light. Parenteral formulations of hypericin (photoactivated just before administration) have been used investigationally to treat HIV infection (given intravenously) and basal and squamous cell carcinoma (given by intralesional injection). In vitro, photoactivated hypericin inhibits a variety of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses as well as the growth of cells in some neoplastic tissues. Inhibition of protein kinase C and of singlet oxygen radical generation have been proposed as possible mechanisms. The latter could inhibit cell growth or cause cell apoptosis. These studies were carried out using the isolated hypericin constituent of St. John's wort; the usual hydroalcoholic extract of St. John's wort has not been studied for these indications and should not be recommended for patients with viral illness or cancer.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Photosensitization has been reported, and patients should be instructed to wear sunscreen while using this product. Hypomania, mania, and autonomic arousal have also been reported in patients using St. John's wort.

\section*{Drug I nteractions \& Precautions}

Inhibition of reuptake of various amine transmitters has been highlighted as a potential mechanism of action for St. John's wort. Drugs with similar mechanisms (ie, antidepressants, stimulants) should be used cautiously or avoided in patients using St. John's wort due to the risk of serotonin syndrome or MAO crisis (see Chapters 16 and 30). This herb may induce hepatic CYP enzymes (3A4, 2C9, 1A2) and the P-glycoprotein drug transporter. This has led to case reports of subtherapeutic levels of numerous drugs, including digoxin, birth control drugs (and subsequent pregnancy), cyclosporine, HIV protease and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, warfarin, irinotecan, theophylline, and anticonvulsants.

\section*{Dosage}

The most common commercial formulation of St. John's wort is the dried hydroalcoholic extract. Products should be standardized to 2-5\% hyperforin, although most still bear the older standardized marker of $0.3 \%$ hypericin. The recommended dosing for mild to moderate depression is 900 mg of the dried extract per day in three divided doses. Onset of effect may take 2-4 weeks. Long-term benefits beyond 12 weeks have not been sufficiently studied.

\section*{SAW PALMETTO (SERENOA REPENS OR SABAL SERRULATA)}

\section*{Chemistry}

The active constituents in saw palmetto berries are not well defined. Phytosterols (eg, B-sitosterol), aliphatic alcohols, polyprenic compounds, and flavonoids are all present. Marketed preparations are lipophilic extracts that contain 85-95\% fatty acids and sterols.

\section*{Pharmacologic Effects}

Saw palmetto is most often used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Enzymatic conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5x-reductase is inhibited by saw palmetto in vitro. Specifically, saw palmetto shows a noncompetitive inhibition of both isotypes (I and II) of this enzyme, thereby reducing DHT production. In vitro, saw palmetto also inhibits the binding of DHT to androgen receptors. Additional effects that have been observed in vitro include inhibition of prostatic growth factors, blockade of $\alpha_{1}$ adrenoceptors, and inhibition of inflammatory mediators produced by the 5 -lipoxygenase pathway.

The clinical pharmacology of saw palmetto in humans is not well defined. One week of treatment in healthy volunteers failed to influence 5.-reductase activity, DHT concentration, or testosterone concentration. Six months of treatment in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia also failed to affect prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, a marker that is typically reduced by enzymatic inhibition of 5x-reductase. In contrast, other researchers have reported a reduction in epidermal growth factor, DHT levels, and estrogen expression after 3 months of treatment in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Results of recent meta-analyses and reviews suggested that saw palmetto is significantly more effective than placebo in alleviating urologic symptoms (eg, peak flow, nocturia, international prostate symptom scores) associated with mild to moderate BPH. Saw palmetto, $320 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, was also shown to have comparable efficacy to $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ of finasteride (a prescription 5a-reductase inhibitor) and $0.4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ of tamsulosin (a prescription a.-blocker) in clinical trials lasting 6 months and 1 year, respectively. In marked contrast, a recent well-controlled, double-blind 1-year study showed no significant effect of saw palmetto on symptoms or objective measures in moderate to severe BPH. The efficacy of saw palmetto in BPH beyond 5 years has not been studied.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Adverse effects are rare and reported with an incidence of $1-3 \%$. The most common include gastrointestinal upset, hypertension, decreased libido, abdominal pain, impotence, back pain, urinary retention, and headache. In comparison to tamsulosin and finasteride, saw palmetto is less likely to affect sexual function (eg, ejaculation) in men.

\section*{Drug Interactions, Precautions, \& Dosing}

No drug-drug interactions have been reported for saw palmetto. Because saw palmetto has no effect on the PSA marker, it will not interfere with prostate cancer screening using this test. Recommended dosing of a standardized dried extract (containing 85-95\% fatty acids and sterols) is 160 mg orally twice daily. Patients should be instructed that it may take 4-6 weeks for onset of clinical effects.

\section*{COENZYME Q10}

Coenzyme Q10, also known as CoQ, CoQ10, and ubiquinone, is found in the mitochondria of many
organs, including the heart, kidney, and liver, and in skeletal muscle. After ingestion, the reduced form of coenzyme Q10, ubiquinol, predominates in the systemic circulation. Coenzyme Q10 is a potent antioxidant and may have a role in maintaining healthy muscle function, although the clinical significance of this effect is unknown. Reduced serum levels have been reported in Parkinson's disease.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{HYPERTENSION}

Various open label and controlled studies have identified small reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of approximately 10 mm Hg following 10 weeks of therapy. Although this observation appears to be consistent, better designed studies are required.

\section*{HEART FAILURE}

Older studies suggested that coenzyme Q10 was effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of heart failure. Current research suggests that the supplement does not alter cardiac function (as determined with Swan-Ganz catheter measurements and echocardiography) in cardiomyopathy patients with class I, II, or III NY Heart Association status. Furthermore, patients with lower than normal endogenous coenzyme Q10 levels do not display subjective or objective improvements in heart failure assessments when given coenzyme Q10 supplements.

\section*{ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE}

The effects of coenzyme Q10 on coronary artery disease and chronic stable angina are modest but appear promising. Double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that coenzyme Q10 supplementation improved a number of clinical measures in patients with a history of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Improvements have been observed in lipoprotein a, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, exercise tolerance, and time to development of ischemic changes on the electrocardiogram during stress tests. In addition, very small reductions in cardiac deaths and rate of reinfarction in patients with previous AMI were reported (absolute risk reduction 1.5\%).

\section*{NEUROLOGIC DISEASES}

Coenzyme Q has been reported to slow the progression of early Parkinson's disease when given at high dosage ( $300-1200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ), although the time to requirement for levodopa treatment was not shortened. Another study indicated that migraine attacks were reduced in frequency at a dosage of $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. No benefit was found in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Huntington's disease.

\section*{ADVERSE EFFECTS}

Coenzyme Q10 is well tolerated, rarely leading to any adverse effects at doses as high as $3000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. In clinical trials gastrointestinal upset, anorexia, and nausea have been reported. Cases of maculopapular rash and thrombocytopenia have very rarely been observed. Other rare adverse effects include irritability, dizziness, and headache.

\section*{DRUG INTERACTIONS}

Coenzyme Q10 shares a structural similarity with vitamin K, and an interaction has been observed between coenzyme Q10 and warfarin. Coenzyme Q10 supplements may decrease the effects of warfarin therapy. This combination should be avoided or very carefully monitored.

A reduction in endogenous coenzyme Q10 levels has been observed in patients beginning HMG-CoA
reductase inhibitors. The clinical significance of this reduction is currently unknown, and the long-term effects of coenzyme Q10 supplementation in patients taking HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors has not been studied clinically. Anecdotal evidence has suggested that adding coenzyme Q10 to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy may help to prevent the rare adverse effect of myopathy, which can ultimately progress to rhabdomyolysis. Clinical trials are needed to confirm this effect.

\section*{Dosage}

As a dietary supplement, 30 mg of coenzyme Q10 is adequate to replace low endogenous levels. For neural or cardiac effects, typical doses are $100-600 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ given in two or three divided doses. These therapeutic doses increase endogenous levels to $2-3 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ (normal for healthy adults, 0.7-1 $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ ).

\section*{GLUCOSAMI NE}

Glucosamine is found in human tissue, is a substrate for the production of articular cartilage, and also serves as a cartilage nutrient. Glucosamine is commercially derived from crabs and other crustaceans. As a dietary supplement, glucosamine is primarily used for pain associated with knee osteoarthritis.

\section*{Pharmacologic Effects \& Clinical Uses}

Endogenous glucosamine is used for the production of glycosaminoglycans and other proteoglycans in articular cartilage. In osteoarthritis, the rate of production of new cartilage is exceeded by the rate of degradation of existing cartilage. Supplementation with glucosamine is thought to increase the supply of the necessary glycosaminoglycan building blocks, leading to better maintenance and strengthening of existing cartilage.

Many clinical trials have been conducted on the effects of both oral and intra-articular administration of glucosamine. Early studies demonstrated significant improvements in overall mobility, range of motion, and strength in patients with osteoarthritis. Some recent evidence has shown mixed results, with both positive and negative trials. One meta-analysis found an overall moderate effect in knee osteoarthritis improvement, although study limitations may have overestimated treatment benefits. However, the most recent large double-blind trial, which compared glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, the combination, and placebo, found no benefit for this therapy. It is possible that specific subgroups may benefit from glucosamine. More research is needed to better define the specific patient populations that stand to benefit from glucosamine.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Glucosamine is very well tolerated. In clinical trials, mild diarrhea and nausea were occasionally reported. Cross allergenicity in people with shellfish allergies is a potential concern; however, this is unlikely if the formulation has been adequately manufactured and purified.

\section*{Drug I nteractions \& Precautions}

There are no known drug interactions with glucosamine.

\section*{Dosage}

The dosage used most often in clinical trials is 500 mg three times daily or 1500 mg once daily.

Glucosamine does not have direct analgesic effects, and improvements, if any, may not be observed for 1-2 months. Although all salt forms of glucosamine (sulfate and hydrochloride) should dissolve and be available for absorption, there is some evidence that the sulfate formulation may be superior clinically.

\section*{MELATONI N}

Melatonin, a serotonin derivative produced by the pineal gland and some other tissues (see also Chapter 16), is believed to be responsible for regulating sleep-wake cycles. Release coincides with darkness; it typically begins around 9 PM and lasts until about 4 AM . Melatonin release is suppressed by daylight. Melatonin has also been studied for a number of other functions, including contraception, protection against endogenous oxidants, prevention of aging, and treatment of depression, HIV infection, and a variety of cancers. Currently, melatonin is most often administered to prevent jet lag and to induce sleep.

\section*{Pharmacologic Effects \& Clinical Uses}

\section*{JET LAG}

Jet lag, a disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle, occurs when there is a disparity between the external time and the traveler's endogenous circadian clock (internal time). The internal time regulates not only daily sleep rhythms but also body temperature and many metabolic systems. The synchronization of the circadian clock relies on light as the most potent "zeitgeber" (time giver).

Jet lag is especially common among frequent travelers and airplane cabin crews. Typical symptoms of jet lag may include daytime drowsiness, insomnia, frequent awakenings, and gastrointestinal upset. Clinical studies with administration of melatonin have reported subjective reduction in daytime fatigue, improved mood, and a quicker recovery time (return to normal sleep patterns, energy, and alertness). Unfortunately, many of these studies were characterized by inconsistencies in dosing, duration of therapy, and time of drug administration. In addition to melatonin, maximizing exposure to daylight on arrival at the new destination can aid in resetting the internal clock.

\section*{INSOMNIA}

Melatonin has been studied in the treatment of various sleep disorders, including insomnia and delayed sleep-phase syndrome. It has been shown to improve sleep onset, duration, and quality when administered to healthy volunteers, suggesting a pharmacologic hypnotic effect. Melatonin has also been shown to increase rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep.

Clinical studies in patients with sleep disorders have shown that oral melatonin supplementation may alter sleep architecture. Subjective improvements in sleep quality and improvements in sleep onset and sleep duration have been reported. However, the significance of these findings is impaired by many study limitations.

Patients older than 65 years of age tend to suffer from sleep maintenance insomnia; melatonin serum levels have been reported to be low in these patients. Elderly patients with sleep maintenance insomnia who received immediate-release and sustained-release melatonin had improved sleep onset time. They did not, however, experience an improvement in sleep maintenance or total sleep time.

\section*{FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION}

Melatonin receptors have been identified in granulosa cell membranes, and significant amounts of melatonin have been detected in ovarian follicular fluid. Melatonin has been associated with midcycle suppression of luteinizing hormone surge and secretion. This may result in partial inhibition of ovulation. Nightly doses of melatonin ( $75-300 \mathrm{mg}$ ) given with a progestin through days 1-21 of the menstrual cycle resulted in lower mean luteinizing hormone levels. Therefore, melatonin should not be used by women who are pregnant or attempting to conceive. Furthermore, melatonin supplementation may decrease prolactin release in women and therefore should be used cautiously or not at all while nursing.

\section*{MALE REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION}

In healthy men, chronic melatonin administration ( $\approx 6$ months) decreased sperm quality, possibly by aromatase inhibition in the testes. Until more is known, melatonin should not be used by couples who are actively trying to conceive.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Melatonin appears to be well tolerated and is often used in preference to over-the-counter "sleep-aid" drugs. Although melatonin is associated with few adverse effects, some next-day drowsiness has been reported as well as tachycardia, depression, vivid dreams, and headache. Sporadic case reports of movement disorders and psychoses have also appeared.

\section*{Drug I nteractions}

Melatonin drug interactions have not been formally studied. Various studies, however, suggest that melatonin concentrations are altered by a variety of drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants, B-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists, scopolamine, and sodium valproate. The relevance of these effects is unknown. Melatonin is metabolized by CYP450 1A2 and may interact with other drugs that either inhibit or induce the 1A2 isoenzyme.

\section*{Dosage}

\section*{JET LAG}

The optimal timing and dose of melatonin have not been established. Current information suggests $5-8 \mathrm{mg}$ of the immediate-release formulation given on the evening of departure and for 1-3 nights after arrival at the new destination. Exposure to daylight at the new time zone is also important to regulate the sleep-wake cycle.

\section*{INSOMNIA}

Doses of $0.3-10 \mathrm{mg}$ of the immediate-release formulation orally given once nightly have been tried. The lowest effective dose should be used first and may be repeated in 30 minutes up to a maximum of $10-20 \mathrm{mg}$. Sustained-release formulations may be used but currently do not appear to offer any advantages over the immediate-release formulations. Sustained-release formulations are also more costly.

\section*{RATI ONAL PRESCRI BING \& PRESCRI PTI ON WRI TI NG: I NTRODUCTION}

Once a patient with a clinical problem has been evaluated and a diagnosis has been reached, the practitioner can often select from a variety of therapeutic approaches. Medication, surgery, psychiatric treatment, radiation, physical therapy, health education, counseling, further consultation, and no therapy are some of the options available. Of these options, drug therapy is by far the one most frequently chosen. In most cases, this requires the writing of a prescription. A written prescription is the prescriber's order to prepare or dispense a specific treatment-usually medication-for a specific patient. When a patient comes for an office visit, the physician or other authorized health professional prescribes medications $67 \%$ of the time, and an average of one prescription per office visit is written because more than one prescription may be written at a single visit.

In this chapter, a plan for prescribing is presented. The physical form of the prescription, common prescribing errors, and legal requirements that govern various features of the prescribing process are then discussed. Finally, some of the social and economic factors involved in prescribing and drug use are described.

\section*{RATI ONAL PRESCRIBING}

Like any other process in health care, writing a prescription should be based on a series of rational steps.
(1) Make a specific diagnosis: Prescriptions based merely on a desire to satisfy the patient's psychological need for some type of therapy are often unsatisfactory and may result in adverse effects. A specific diagnosis, even if it is tentative, is required to move to the next step. For example, in a 35-year-old woman with symmetric joint stiffness, pain, and inflammation that are worse in the morning and not associated with a history of infection, a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis would be considered. This diagnosis and the reasoning underlying it should be shared with the patient.
(2) Consider the pathophysiologic implications of the diagnosis: If the disorder is well understood, the prescriber is in a much better position to offer effective therapy. For example, increasing knowledge about the mediators of inflammation makes possible more effective use of NSAIDs and other agents used in rheumatoid arthritis. The patient should be provided with the appropriate level and amount of information about the pathophysiology. Many pharmacies and disease-oriented public and private agencies (eg, American Heart Association, American Cancer Society, Arthritis Foundation) provide information sheets suitable for patients.
(3) Select a specific therapeutic objective: A therapeutic objective should be chosen for each of the pathophysiologic processes defined in the preceding step. In a patient with rheumatoid arthritis, relief of pain by reduction of the inflammatory process is one of the major therapeutic goals that identifies the drug groups which will be considered. Arresting the course of the disease process in rheumatoid arthritis is a different therapeutic goal that might lead to consideration of other drug groups and prescriptions.
(4) Select a drug of choice: One or more drug groups will be suggested by each of the therapeutic goals specified in the preceding step. Selection of a drug of choice from among these groups follows from a consideration of the specific characteristics of the patient and the clinical presentation. For certain drugs, characteristics such as age, other diseases, and other drugs being taken are extremely important in determining the most suitable drug for management of the present complaint. In the example of the patient with probable rheumatoid arthritis, it would be important to know whether the patient has a history of aspirin intolerance or ulcer disease, whether the cost of medication is an especially important factor and the nature of the patient's insurance coverage, and whether there is a need for once-daily dosing. Based on this information, a drug would probably be selected from the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory group. If the patient is intolerant of aspirin and does not have ulcer disease but does have a need for low-cost treatment, ibuprofen or naproxen would be a rational choice.
(5) Determine the appropriate dosing regimen: The dosing regimen is determined primarily by the pharmacokinetics of the drug in that patient. If the patient is known to have disease of the organs required for elimination of the drug selected, adjustment of the average regimen is needed. For a drug such as ibuprofen, which is eliminated mainly by the kidneys, renal function should be assessed. If renal function is normal, the half-life of ibuprofen (about 2 hours) requires administration three or four times daily. The dose suggested in this book, drug handbooks, and the manufacturer's literature is $400-800 \mathrm{mg}$ four times daily.
(6) Devise a plan for monitoring the drug's action and determine an end point for therapy: The prescriber should be able to describe to the patient the kinds of drug effects that will be monitored and in what way, including laboratory tests (if necessary) and signs and symptoms that the patient should report. For conditions that call for a limited course of therapy (eg, most infections), the duration of therapy should be made clear so that the patient does not stop taking the drug prematurely and understands why the prescription probably need not be renewed. For the patient with rheumatoid arthritis, the need for prolonged-perhaps indefinite-therapy should be explained. The prescriber should also specify any changes in the patient's condition that would call for changes in therapy. For example, in the patient with rheumatoid arthritis, development of gastrointestinal bleeding would require an immediate change in drug therapy and a prompt workup of the bleeding. Major toxicities that require immediate attention should be explained clearly to the patient.
(7) Plan a program of patient education: The prescriber and other members of the health team should be prepared to repeat, extend, and reinforce the information transmitted to the patient as often as necessary. The more toxic the drug prescribed, the greater the importance of this educational program. The importance of informing and involving the patient in each of the above steps must be recognized, as shown by experience with teratogenic drugs (see Chapter 60). Many pharmacies routinely provide this type of information with each prescription filled, but the prescriber must not assume that this will occur.

\section*{THE PRESCRI PTION}

Although a prescription can be written on any piece of paper (as long as all of the legal elements are present), it usually takes a specific form. A typical printed prescription form for outpatients is shown in

Figure 66-1.
Figure 66-1.

Common form of outpatient prescription. Circled numbers are explained in the text.

In the hospital setting, drugs are prescribed on a particular page of the patient's hospital chart called the physician's order sheet (POS) or chart order. The contents of that prescription are specified in the medical staff rules by the hospital's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. The patient's name is typed or written on the form; therefore, the orders consist of the name and strength of the medication, the dose, the route and frequency of administration, the date, other pertinent information, and the signature of the prescriber. If the duration of therapy or the number of doses is not specified (which is often the case), the medication is continued until the prescriber discontinues the order or until it is terminated as a matter of policy routine, eg, a stop-order policy.

A typical chart order might be as follows:
11/13/06
10:30 a.m.
(1) Ampicillin 500 mg IV q $6 \mathrm{~h} \times 5$ days

\section*{(2) Aspirin 0.6 g per rectum q 6 h prn temp over 101}

\section*{[Signed] Janet B. Doe, MD}

Thus, the elements of the hospital chart order are equivalent to the central elements (5, 8-11, 15) of the outpatient prescription.

\section*{Elements of the Prescription}

The first four elements (see circled numerals in Figure 66-1) of the outpatient prescription establish the identity of the prescriber: name, license classification (ie, professional degree), address, and office telephone number. Before dispensing a prescription, the pharmacist must establish the prescriber's bona fides and should be able to contact the prescriber by telephone if any questions arise. Element [5] is the date the prescription was written. It should be near the top of the prescription form or at the beginning (left margin) of the chart order. Since the order has legal significance and usually has some temporal relationship to the date of the patient-prescriber interview, a pharmacist should refuse to fill a prescription without verification by telephone if too much time has elapsed since its writing.

Elements [6] and [7] identify the patient by name and address. The patient's name and full address should be clearly spelled out.

The body of the prescription contains the elements [8] to [11] that specify the medication, the strength and quantity to be dispensed, the dosage, and complete directions for use. When writing the drug name (element [8]), either the brand name (proprietary name) or the generic name (nonproprietary name) may be used. Reasons for using one or the other are discussed below. The strength of the medication [9] should be written in metric units. However, the prescriber should be familiar with both systems now in use: metric and apothecary. For practical purposes, the following approximate conversions are useful:
```
1 grain (gr) = 0.065 grams (g), often rounded to 60 milligrams (mg)
15 gr = 1 g
1 ounce (oz) by volume = 30 milliliters (mL)
1 teaspoonful (tsp) = 5 mL
1 tablespoonful(tbsp) = 15 mL
1 quart (qt) = 1000 mL
1 minim = 1 drop (gtt)
20 drops = 1 mL
2.2 pounds (lb) = 1 kilogram (kg)
```

The strength of a solution is usually expressed as the quantity of solute in sufficient solvent to make 100 mL ; for instance, 20\% potassium chloride solution is 20 grams of KCl per deciliter (g/dL) of final solution. Both the concentration and the volume should be explicitly written out.

The quantity of medication prescribed should reflect the anticipated duration of therapy, the cost, the need for continued contact with the clinic or physician, the potential for abuse, and the potential for toxicity or overdose. Consideration should be given also to the standard sizes in which the product is
available and whether this is the initial prescription of the drug or a repeat prescription or refill. If 10 days of therapy are required to effectively cure a streptococcal infection, an appropriate quantity for the full course should be prescribed. Birth control pills are often prescribed for 1 year or until the next examination is due; however, some patients may not be able to afford a year's supply at one time; therefore, a 3-month supply might be ordered, with refill instructions to renew three times or for 1 year (element [12]). Some third-party (insurance) plans limit the amount of medicine that can be dispensed-often to only a month's supply. Finally, when first prescribing medications that are to be used for the treatment of a chronic disease, the initial quantity should be small, with refills for larger quantities. The purpose of beginning treatment with a small quantity of drug is to reduce the cost if the patient cannot tolerate it. Once it is determined that intolerance is not a problem, a larger quantity purchased less frequently is sometimes less expensive.

The directions for use (element [11]) must be both drug-specific and patient-specific. The simpler the directions, the better; and the fewer the number of doses (and drugs) per day, the better. Patient noncompliance (also known as nonadherence, failure to adhere to the drug regimen) is a major cause of treatment failure. To help patients remember to take their medications, prescribers often give an instruction that medications be taken at or around mealtimes and at bedtime. However, it is important to inquire about the patient's eating habits and other lifestyle patterns, because many patients do not eat three regularly spaced meals a day.

The instructions on how and when to take medications, the duration of therapy, and the purpose of the medication must be explained to each patient both by the prescriber and by the pharmacist. (Neither should assume that the other will do it.) Furthermore, the drug name, the purpose for which it is given, and the duration of therapy should be written on each label so that the drug may be identified easily in case of overdose. An instruction to "take as directed" may save the time it takes to write the orders out but often leads to noncompliance, patient confusion, and medication error. The directions for use must be clear and concise to avoid toxicity and to obtain the greatest benefits from therapy.

Although directions for use are no longer written in Latin, many Latin apothecary abbreviations (and some others included below) are still in use. Knowledge of these abbreviations is essential for the dispensing pharmacist and often useful for the prescriber. Some of the abbreviations still used are listed in Table 66-1.

Note: It is always safer to write out the direction without abbreviating.
Elements [12] to [14] of the prescription include refill information, waiver of the requirement for childproof containers, and additional labeling instructions (eg, warnings such as "may cause drowsiness," "do not drink alcohol"). Pharmacists put the name of the medication on the label unless directed otherwise by the prescriber, and some medications have the name of the drug stamped or imprinted on the tablet or capsule. Pharmacists must place the expiration date for the drug on the label. If the patient or prescriber does not request waiver of childproof containers, the pharmacist or dispenser must place the medication in such a container. Pharmacists may not refill a prescription medication without authorization from the prescriber. Prescribers may grant authorization to renew prescriptions at the time of writing the prescription or over the telephone. Elements [15] to [17] are the prescriber's signature and other identification data.

\section*{PRESCRIBINGERRORS}

All prescription orders should be legible, unambiguous, dated (and timed in the case of a chart order), and signed clearly for optimal communication between prescriber, pharmacist, and nurse. Furthermore, a good prescription or chart order should contain sufficient information to permit the pharmacist or nurse to discover possible errors before the drug is dispensed or administered.

Several types of prescribing errors are particularly common. These include errors involving omission of needed information; poor writing perhaps leading to errors of drug dose or timing; and prescription of drugs that are inappropriate for the specific situation.

\section*{Omission of Information}

Errors of omission are common in hospital orders and may include instructions to "resume pre-op meds," which assumes that a full and accurate record of the "pre-op meds" is available; "continue present IV fluids," which fails to state exactly what fluids are to be given, in what volume, and over what time period; or "continue eye drops," which omits mention of which eye is to be treated as well as the drug, concentration, and frequency of administration. Chart orders may also fail to discontinue a prior medication when a new one is begun; may fail to state whether a regular or long-acting form is to be used; may fail to specify a strength or notation for long-acting forms; or may authorize "as needed" (prn) use that fails to state what conditions will justify the need.

\section*{Poor Prescription Writing}

Poor prescription writing is traditionally exemplified by illegible handwriting. However, other types of poor writing are common and often more dangerous. One of the most important is the misplaced or ambiguous decimal point. Thus ". 1 " is easily misread as " 1 ," a tenfold overdose, if the decimal point is not unmistakably clear. This danger is easily avoided by always preceding the decimal point with a zero. On the other hand, appending an unnecessary zero after a decimal point increases the risk of a tenfold overdose, because " 1.0 mg " is easily misread as " 10 mg ," whereas " 1 mg " is not. The slash or virgule ("/") was traditionally used as a substitute for a decimal point. This should be abandoned because it is too easily misread as the numeral "1." Similarly, the abbreviation "U" for units should never be used because "10U" is easily misread as "100"; the word "units" should always be written out. Doses in micrograms should always have this unit written out because the abbreviated form (" $\mu \cdot \mathrm{g}$ ") is very easily misread as "mg," a 1000-fold overdose! Orders for drugs specifying only the number of dosage units and not the total dose required should not be filled if more than one size dosage unit exists for that drug. For example, ordering "one ampule of furosemide" is unacceptable because furosemide is available in ampules that contain 20, 40, or 100 mg of the drug. The abbreviation "OD" should be used (if at all) only to mean "the right eye"; it has been used for "every day" and has caused inappropriate administration of drugs into the eye. Similarly, "Q.D." or "QD" should not be used because it is often read as "QID," resulting in four daily doses instead of one. Acronyms such as "ASA" (aspirin), "5-ASA" (5-aminosalicylic acid), "6MP" (6-mercaptopurine), etc, should not be used; drug names should be written out. Unclear handwriting can be lethal when drugs with similar names but very different effects are available, eg, acetazolamide and acetohexamide, methotrexate and metolazone. In this situation, errors are best avoided by noting the indication for the drug in the body of the prescription, eg, "acetazolamide, for glaucoma."

\section*{Inappropriate Drug Prescriptions}

Prescribing an inappropriate drug for a particular patient results from failure to recognize contraindications imposed by other diseases the patient may have, failure to obtain information about other drugs the patient is taking (including over-the-counter drugs), or failure to recognize possible physicochemical incompatibilities between drugs that may react with each other. Contraindications to drugs in the presence of other diseases or pharmacokinetic characteristics are listed in the discussions of the drugs described in this book. The manufacturer's package insert usually contains similar information. Some of the important drug interactions are listed in Appendix II of this book as well as in package inserts.

Physicochemical incompatibilities are of particular concern when parenteral administration is planned.

For example, certain insulin preparations should not be mixed. Similarly, the simultaneous administration of antacids or products high in metal content may compromise the absorption of many drugs in the intestine, eg, tetracyclines. The package insert and the Handbook on Injectable Drugs (see References) are good sources for this information.

\section*{COMPLI ANCE}

Compliance (sometimes called adherence) is the extent to which patients follow treatment instructions. There are four types of noncompliance leading to medication errors.
(1) The patient fails to obtain the medication. Some studies suggest that one third of patients never have their prescriptions filled. Some patients leave the hospital without obtaining their discharge medications, whereas others leave the hospital without having their prehospitalization medications resumed. Some patients cannot afford the medications prescribed.
(2) The patient fails to take the medication as prescribed. Examples include wrong dosage, wrong frequency of administration, improper timing or sequencing of administration, wrong route or technique of administration, or taking medication for the wrong purpose. This usually results from inadequate communication between the patient and the prescriber and the pharmacist.
(3) The patient prematurely discontinues the medication. This can occur, for instance, if the patient incorrectly assumes that the medication is no longer needed because the bottle is empty or symptomatic improvement has occurred.
(4) The patient (or another person) takes medication inappropriately. For example, the patient may share a medication with others for any of several reasons.

Several factors encourage noncompliance. Some diseases cause no symptoms (eg, hypertension); patients with these diseases therefore have no symptoms to remind them to take their medications. Patients with painful conditions, such as arthritis, may continually change medications in the hope of finding a better one. Characteristics of the therapy itself can limit the degree of compliance; patients taking a drug once a day are much more likely to be compliant than those taking a drug four times a day. Various patient factors also play a role in compliance. Patients living alone are much less likely to be compliant than married patients of the same age. Packaging may also be a deterrent to compliance-elderly arthritic patients often have difficulty opening their medication containers. Lack of transportation as well as various social or personal beliefs about medications are likewise barriers to compliance.

Strategies for improving compliance include enhanced communication between the patient and health care team members; assessment of personal, social, and economic conditions (often reflected in the patient's lifestyle); development of a routine for taking medications (eg, at mealtimes if the patient has regular meals); provision of systems to assist taking medications (ie, containers that separate drug doses by day of the week, or medication alarm clocks that remind patients to take their medications); and mailing of refill reminders by the pharmacist to patients taking drugs chronically. The patient who is likely to discontinue a medication because of a perceived drug-related problem should receive instruction about how to monitor and understand the effects of the medication. Compliance can often be improved by enlisting the patient's active participation in the treatment.

\section*{LEGAL FACTORS (USA)}

The United States government recognizes two classes of drugs: (1) over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and (2) those that require a prescription from a licensed prescriber (Rx Only). OTC drugs are those that can be safely self-administered by the layman for self-limiting conditions and for which appropriate labels can be written for lay comprehension. Half of all drug doses consumed by the American public are OTC drugs.

Physicians, dentists, podiatrists, and veterinarians—and, in some states, specialized pharmacists, nurses, physician's assistants, and optometrists-are granted authority to prescribe dangerous drugs (those bearing the federal legend statement, "Rx Only") on the basis of their training in diagnosis and treatment (see Who May Prescribe?). Pharmacists are authorized to dispense prescriptions pursuant to a prescriber's order provided that the medication order is appropriate and rational for the patient. Nurses are authorized to administer medications to patients subject to a prescriber's order (Table 66-2).

Prescription drugs are controlled by the United States Food and Drug Administration as described in Chapter 5. The federal legend statement as well as the package insert is part of the packaging requirements for all prescription drugs. The package insert is the official brochure setting forth the indications, contraindications, warnings, and dosing for the drug.

The prescriber, by writing and signing a prescription order, controls who may obtain prescription drugs. The pharmacist may purchase these drugs, but they may be dispensed only on the order of a legally qualified prescriber. Thus, a prescription is actually three things: the physician's order in the patient's chart, the written order to which the pharmacist refers when dispensing, and the patient's medication container with a label affixed.

Whereas the federal government controls the drugs and their labeling and distribution, the state legislatures control who may prescribe drugs through their licensing boards, eg, the Board of Medical Examiners. Prescribers must pass examinations, pay fees, and-in the case of some states and some professions-meet other requirements for relicensure such as continuing education. If these requirements are met, the prescriber is licensed to order dispensing of drugs.

The federal government and the states further impose special restrictions on drugs according to their perceived potential for abuse (Table 66-3). Such drugs include opioids, hallucinogens, stimulants, depressants, and anabolic steroids. Special requirements must be met when these drugs are to be prescribed. The Controlled Drug Act requires prescribers and dispensers to register with the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), pay a fee, receive a personal registration number, and keep records of all controlled drugs prescribed or dispensed. Every time a controlled drug is prescribed, a valid DEA number must appear on the prescription blank.

Table 66-3. Classification of Controlled Substances.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Schedule & Potential for Abuse & Other Comments \\
\hline I & High & No accepted medical use; lack of accepted safety as drug. \\
\hline II & High & Current accepted medical use. Abuse may lead to psychologic or physical dependence. \\
\hline III & Less than I or II & Current accepted medical use. Moderate or low potential for physical dependence and high potential for psychologic dependence. \\
\hline IV & Less than III & Current accepted medical use. Limited potential for dependence. \\
\hline V & Less than IV & Current accepted medical use. Limited dependence possible. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

See Schedule of Controlled Drugs for examples.
Prescriptions for substances with a high potential for abuse (schedule II) cannot be refilled. Prescriptions for schedule III, IV, and V drugs can be refilled, but there is a five-refill maximum, and in no case may the prescription be refilled after 6 months from the date of writing. Schedule II drug prescriptions may not be transmitted over the telephone, and some states require a special stateissued prescription blank. These restrictive prescribing laws are intended to limit the amount of drugs of abuse that are made available to the public.

Unfortunately, the inconvenience occasioned by these laws-and an unwarranted fear by medical professionals themselves regarding the risk of patient tolerance and addiction-continues to hamper adequate treatment of patients with terminal conditions. This has been shown to be particularly true in children and elderly patients with cancer. There is no excuse for inadequate treatment of pain in a terminal patient; not only is addiction irrelevant in such a patient, it is actually uncommon in patients who are being treated for pain (see Chapter 31). Some states have recognized the underutilization of pain medications in the treatment of pain associated with chronic and terminal conditions. California, for example, has enacted an "intractable pain treatment" act that reduces the difficulty of renewing prescriptions for opioids. Under the provisions of this act, upon receipt of a copy of the order from the prescriber, eg, by fax, a pharmacist may write a prescription for a Schedule II substance for a patient under hospice care or living in a skilled nursing facility or in cases in which the patient is expected to live less than 6 months, provided that the prescriber countersigns the order (by fax); the word "exemption" with regulatory code number is written on a typical prescription, thus providing easier access for the terminally ill.

\section*{Who May Prescribe?}

The right to prescribe drugs has traditionally been the responsibility of the physician, dentist, podiatrist, or veterinarian. Prescribing now includes-in a number of states and in varying degrees-pharmacists, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, physician's assistants, and optometrists (see Table 66-2). The development of large health maintenance organizations has greatly strengthened this movement because it offers these extremely powerful economic bodies a way to reduce their expenses.

The primary organizations controlling the privilege of prescribing in the USA are the state boards, under the powers delegated to them by the state legislatures. As indicated in Table 66-2, many state boards have attempted to reserve some measure of the primary responsibility for prescribing to physicians by requiring that the ancillary professional work with or under a physician according to a specific protocol. In the state of California, this protocol must include a statement of the training, supervision, and documentation requirements of the arrangement and must specify referral requirements, limitations to the list of drugs that may be prescribed (ie, a formulary), and a method of evaluation by the supervising physician. The protocol must be in writing and must be periodically updated (See reference: An Explanation of the Scope of RN Practice, 1994).

\section*{Labeled \& Unlabeled Uses of Drugs}

In the USA, the FDA approves a drug only for the specific uses proposed and documented by the manufacturer in its New Drug Application (see Chapter 5). These approved (labeled) uses or indications are set forth in the package insert that accompanies the drug. For a variety of reasons, these labeled indications may not include all the conditions in which the drug might be useful. Therefore, a clinician may wish to prescribe the agent for some other, unapproved (unlabeled) clinical condition, often on the basis of adequate or even compelling scientific evidence. Federal laws governing FDA regulations and drug use place no restrictions on such unapproved use.*

Even if the patient suffers injury from the drug, its use for an unlabeled purpose does not in itself constitute "malpractice." However, the courts may consider the package insert labeling as a complete listing of the indications for which the drug is considered safe unless the clinician can show that other use is considered safe by competent expert testimony.
*"Once a product has been approved for marketing, a physician may prescribe it for uses or in treatment regimens or patient populations that are not included in the approved labeling. Such 'unapproved' or, more precisely, 'unlabeled' uses may be appropriate and rational in certain circumstances, and may, in fact, reflect approaches to drug therapy that have been extensively reported in medical literature."-FDA Drug Bull 1982; 12: 4.

\section*{SOCI OECONOMI C FACTORS}

\section*{Generic Prescribing}

Prescribing by generic name offers the pharmacist flexibility in selecting the particular drug product to fill the order and the patient a potential savings if there is price competition. The brand name of a popular sedative is, for example, Valium, manufactured by Roche. The generic (public nonproprietary)
name of the same chemical substance adopted by United States Adopted Names (USAN) and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is diazepam. All diazepam drug products in the USA meet the pharmaceutical standards expressed in United States Pharmacopeia (USP). However, there are several manufacturers, and prices vary greatly. For some drugs in common use, the difference in cost between the trade-named product and generic products varies from less than twofold to more than 100-fold.

In most states and in most hospitals, pharmacists have the option of supplying a generically equivalent drug product even if a proprietary name has been specified in the order. If the prescriber wants a particular brand of drug product dispensed, handwritten instruction to "dispense as written" or words of similar meaning are required. Some government-subsidized health care programs and many thirdparty insurance payers require that pharmacists dispense the cheapest generically equivalent product in the inventory (generic substitution). However, the principles of drug product selection by private pharmacists do not permit substituting one therapeutic agent for another (therapeutic substitution)-ie, dispensing trichlormethiazide for hydrochlorothiazide would not be permitted without the prescriber's permission even though these two diuretics may be considered pharmacodynamically equivalent. Pharmacists within managed care organizations may follow different policies; see below.

It should not be assumed that every generic drug product is as satisfactory as the trade-named product, although most generics are satisfactory. Bioavailability-the effective absorption of the drug product-varies between manufacturers and sometimes between different lots of a drug produced by the same manufacturer. In the case of a very small number of drugs, which usually have a low therapeutic index, poor solubility, or a high ratio of inert ingredients to active drug content, a specific manufacturer's product may give more consistent results. In the case of life-threatening diseases, the advantages of generic substitution may be outweighed by the clinical urgency so that the prescription should be filled as written.

In an effort to codify bioequivalence information, the FDA publishes Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, with monthly supplements, commonly called "the Orange Book." The book contains listings of multisource products in one of two categories: Products given a code beginning with the letter "A" are considered bioequivalent to a reference standard formulation of the same drug and to all other versions of that product with a similar "A" coding. Products not considered bioequivalent are coded "B." Of the approximately 8000 products listed, $90 \%$ are coded "A." Additional code letters and numerals are appended to the initial "A" or "B" and indicate the approved route of administration and other variables.

Mandatory drug product selection on the basis of price is common practice in the USA because thirdparty payers (insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, etc) enforce money-saving regulations. If outside a managed care organization, the prescriber can sometimes override these controls by writing "dispense as written" on a prescription that calls for a brand-named product. However, in such cases, the patient may have to pay the difference between the dispensed product and the cheaper one.

Within most managed care organizations, formulary controls have been put in place that force the selection of less expensive medications whenever they are available. In a managed care environment, the prescriber often selects the drug group rather than a specific agent, and the pharmacist dispenses
the formulary drug from that group. For example, if a prescriber in such an organization decides that a patient needs a thiazide diuretic, the pharmacist automatically dispenses the single thiazide diuretic carried on the organization's formulary. As noted below, the choice of drugs for the organization's formulary may change from time to time, depending on negotiation of prices and rebates with different manufacturers.

\section*{Other Cost Factors}

The private pharmacy bases its charges on the cost of the drug plus a fee for providing a professional service. Each time a prescription is dispensed, there is a fee. The prescriber controls the frequency of filling prescriptions by authorizing refills and specifying the quantity to be dispensed. Thus, the prescriber can save the patient money by prescribing standard sizes (so that drugs do not have to be repackaged) and, when chronic treatment is involved, by ordering the largest quantity consistent with safety, expense, and third-party plan. Optimal prescribing for cost savings often involves consultation between the prescriber and the pharmacist. Because of continuing increases in the wholesale prices of drugs in the USA, prescription costs have risen dramatically over the past 3 decades (see The Cost of Prescriptions).

\section*{The Cost of Prescriptions}

The cost of prescriptions has risen dramatically in the last several decades. The average price for a single prescription in the USA in 2004 was $\$ 55$. In the California Medicaid Sector, the average charge was over \$80, with generic products being under \$40 per prescription and brand-name products over \$140. This rise is occasioned by new technology, marketing costs, and stockholder expectations. The pharmaceutical industry typically posts double-digit profits annually whereas the retail business sector shows a $3 \%$ profit. The cost to the patient for many new drugs such as statins exceeds $\$ 1000$ per year. The cost of some therapeutic antibody products (MABs) is more than \$10,000 per year. Pharmaceuticals tend to be the highest out-of-pocket health-related cost because other health care services are covered by health insurance, whereas prescriptions often are not.

Because of public and political pressure resulting from this problem, the US Congress enacted the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003 establishing the Medicare Part D plan. This voluntary prescription plan provides for partial payment by private medical insurance companies for some prescriptions for patients who are MediCare-eligible. Unfortunately, the complexity of the legislation and the resulting confusing insurance plans with gaps in coverage, formulary and quantity limits, and the favored economic treatment given the pharmaceutical industry, prevent this plan from solving the high drug cost problem.

High drug costs have caused payers and consumers alike to do without or seek alternative sources. Because the Canadian government has done a better job in controlling drug prices, their prices for the same drug are less than those in the United States. This fact has caused a number of United States citizens to purchase their drugs "off-shore" for "personal use" in quantities up to a 3-month supply-at substantial savings, often as much as 50\%. However, there is no assurance that these drugs are what they are purported to be or that they will be delivered in a timely manner-or that there is a traditional doctor-pharmacist-patient relationship and the safeguards that such a relationship offers.

Without a true universal health care program, the cost of drugs in the USA will continue to be subject to the negotiating power (or lack thereof) of the purchasing group-insurance company, hospital consortium, HMO, small retail pharmacy, etc. Thus far, only the US Veterans Administration system and the larger HMOs have proved strong enough to control costs through bulk purchases of drugs and serious negotiation of prices with manufacturers. Until new legislation gives other organizations the same power to negotiate, or pricing policies are made more equitable, no real solution to the drug cost problem can be expected.

\section*{ACTI VE I MMUNI ZATI ON}

Active immunization consists of the administration of antigen to the host to induce formation of antibodies and cell-mediated immunity. Immunization is practiced to induce protection against many infectious agents and may utilize either inactivated (killed) materials or live attenuated agents (Table I-1). Desirable features of the ideal immunogen include complete prevention of disease, prevention of the carrier state, production of prolonged immunity with a minimum of immunizations, absence of toxicity, and suitability for mass immunization (eg, cheap and easy to administer). Active immunization is generally preferable to passive immunization-in most cases because higher antibody levels are sustained for longer periods of time, requiring less frequent immunization, and in some cases because of the development of concurrent cellmediated immunity. However, active immunization requires time to develop and is therefore generally inactive at the time of a specific exposure (eg, for parenteral exposure to hepatitis $B$, concurrent hepatitis $B$ IgG [passive antibodies] and active immunization are given to prevent illness).

\section*{PASSIVE IMMUNIZATION}

Passive immunization consists of transfer of immunity to a host using preformed immunologic products. From a practical standpoint, only immunoglobulins have been utilized for passive immunization, since passive administration of cellular components of the immune system has been technically difficult and associated with graft-versus-host reactions. Products of the cellular immune system (eg, interferons) have also been used in the therapy of a wide variety of hematologic and infectious diseases (see Chapter 56).

Passive immunization with antibodies may be accomplished with either animal or human immunoglobulins in varying degrees of purity. These may contain relatively high titers of antibodies directed against a specific antigen or, as is true for pooled immune globulin, may simply contain antibodies found in most of
the population. Passive immunization is useful for (1) individuals unable to form antibodies (eg, congenital agammaglobulinemia); (2) prevention of disease when time does not permit active immunization (eg, postexposure); (3) for treatment of certain diseases normally prevented by immunization (eg, tetanus); and (4) for treatment of conditions for which active immunization is unavailable or impractical (eg, snakebite).

Complications from administration of human immunoglobulins are rare. The injections may be moderately painful and rarely a sterile abscess may occur at the injection site. Transient hypotension and pruritus occasionally occur with the administration of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) products, but generally are mild. Individuals with certain immunoglobulin deficiency states (IgA deficiency, etc) may occasionally develop hypersensitivity reactions to immune globulin that may limit therapy. Conventional immune globulin contains aggregates of IgG; it will cause severe reactions if given intravenously. However, if the passively administered antibodies are derived from animal sera, hypersensitivity reactions ranging from anaphylaxis to serum sickness may occur. Highly purified immunoglobulins, especially from rodents or lagomorphs, are the least likely to cause reactions. To avoid anaphylactic reactions, tests for hypersensitivity to the animal serum must be performed. If an alternative preparation is not available and administration of the specific antibody is deemed essential, desensitization can be carried out.

Antibodies derived from human serum not only avoid the risk of hypersensitivity reactions but also have a much longer half-life in humans (about 23 days for IgG antibodies) than those from animal sources (5-7 days or less). Consequently, much smaller doses of human antibody can be administered to provide therapeutic concentrations for several weeks. These advantages point to the desirability of using human antibodies for passive protection whenever possible. Materials available for passive immunization are summarized in Table I-3.

\section*{LEGAL LIABI LITY FOR UNTOWARD REACTIONS}

It is the physician's responsibility to inform the patient of the risk of immunization and to employ vaccines and antisera in an appropriate manner. This may require skin testing to assess the risk of an untoward reaction. Some of the risks described above are, however, currently unavoidable; on the balance, the patient and society are clearly better off accepting the risks for routinely administered immunogens (eg, influenza and tetanus vaccines).

Manufacturers should be held legally accountable for failure to adhere to existing standards for production of biologicals. However, in the present litigious atmosphere of the USA, the filing of large liability claims by the statistically inevitable victims of good public health practice has caused many manufacturers to abandon efforts to develop and produce low-profit but medically valuable therapeutic agents such as vaccines. Since the use and sale of these products are subject to careful review and approval by government bodies such as the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the Food and Drug Administration, "strict product liability" (liability without fault) may be an inappropriate legal standard to apply when rare reactions to biologicals, produced and administered according to government guidelines, are involved.

\section*{RECOMMENDED IMMUNIZATION OF ADULTS FOR TRAVEL}

Every adult, whether traveling or not, should be immunized with tetanus toxoid and should also be fully immunized against poliomyelitis, measles (for those born after 1956), and diphtheria. In addition, every traveler must fulfill the immunization requirements of the health authorities of the countries to be visited. These are listed in Health Information for International Travel, available from the Superintendent of Documents, United States Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. A useful website is www.cdc.gov/travel/vaccinat.htm. The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics also offers periodically updated recommendations for international travelers (see Treatment Guidelines from The Medical Letter , 2006;4:25). Immunizations received in preparation for travel should be recorded on the International Certificate of Immunization. Note: Smallpox vaccination is not recommended or required for travel in any country.

\section*{I MPORTANT DRUG I NTERACTI ONS \& THEI R MECHANI SMS: I NTRODUCTION}

One of the factors that can alter the response to drugs is the concurrent administration of other drugs. There are several mechanisms by which drugs may interact, but most can be categorized as pharmacokinetic (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion), pharmacodynamic, or combined interactions. Knowledge of the mechanism by which a given drug interaction occurs is often clinically useful, since the mechanism may influence both the time course and the methods of circumventing the interaction. Some important drug interactions occur as a result of two or more mechanisms.

\section*{Pharmacokinetic Mechanisms}

The gastrointestinal absorption of drugs may be affected by concurrent use of other agents that (1) have a large surface area upon which the drug can be adsorbed, (2) bind or chelate, (3) alter gastric pH, (4) alter gastrointestinal motility, or (5) affect transport proteins such as P-glycoprotein. One must distinguish between effects on absorption rate and effects on extent of absorption. A reduction in only the absorption rate of a drug is seldom clinically important, whereas a reduction in the extent of absorption will be clinically important if it results in subtherapeutic serum levels.

The mechanisms by which drug interactions alter drug distribution include (1) competition for plasma protein binding, (2) displacement from tissue binding sites, and (3) alterations in local tissue barriers, eg, P -glycoprotein inhibition in the blood-brain barrier. Although competition for plasma protein binding can increase the free concentration (and thus the effect) of the displaced drug in plasma, the increase will be transient owing to a compensatory increase in drug disposition. The clinical importance of protein binding displacement has been overemphasized; current evidence suggests that such interactions are unlikely to result in adverse effects. Displacement from tissue binding sites would tend to transiently increase the blood concentration of the displaced drug.

The metabolism of drugs can be stimulated or inhibited by concurrent therapy. Induction (stimulation) of cytochrome P450 isozymes in the liver and small intestine can be caused by drugs such as barbiturates, bosentan, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, primidone, rifampin, rifabutin, and St. John's wort. Enzyme inducers can also increase the activity of phase II metabolism such as glucuronidation. Enzyme induction does not take place quickly; maximal effects usually occur after 7-10 days and require an equal or longer time to dissipate after the enzyme inducer is stopped. Rifampin, however, may produce enzyme induction after only a few doses. Inhibition of metabolism generally takes place more quickly than enzyme induction and may begin as soon as sufficient tissue concentration of the inhibitor is achieved. However, if the half-life of the affected drug is long, it may take a week or more to reach a new steady-state serum concentration. Drugs that may inhibit cytochrome P450 metabolism of other drugs include amiodarone, androgens, atazanavir, chloramphenicol, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, delavirdine, diltiazem, diphenhydramine, disulfiram, enoxacin, erythromycin, fluconazole, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, substances in grapefruit juice, indinavir, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, metronidazole, mexiletine, miconazole, nefazodone, omeprazole, paroxetine, propoxyphene, quinidine, ritonavir, sulfamethizole, verapamil, voriconazole, zafirlukast, and zileuton.

The renal excretion of active drug can also be affected by concurrent drug therapy. The renal excretion of certain drugs that are weak acids or weak bases may be influenced by other drugs that affect urinary pH . This is due to changes in ionization of the drug, as described in Chapter 1 under Ionization of Weak Acids and Weak Bases; The Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation. For some drugs, active secretion into the renal tubules is an important elimination pathway. The ABC transporter Pglycoprotein is involved in active tubular secretion of some drugs, and inhibition of this transporter can inhibit renal elimination with attendant increase in serum drug concentrations.

\section*{Pharmacodynamic Mechanisms}

When drugs with similar pharmacologic effects are administered concurrently, an additive or synergistic response is usually seen. The two drugs may or may not act on the same receptor to produce such effects. Conversely, drugs with opposing pharmacologic effects may reduce the response to one or both drugs. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions are relatively common in clinical practice, but adverse effects can usually be minimized if one understands the pharmacology of the drugs involved. In this way, the interactions can be anticipated and appropriate countermeasures taken.

\section*{Combined Toxicity}

The combined use of two or more drugs, each of which has toxic effects on the same organ, can greatly increase the likelihood of organ damage. For example, concurrent administration of two nephrotoxic drugs can produce kidney damage even though the dose of either drug alone may have been insufficient to produce toxicity. Furthermore, some drugs can enhance the organ toxicity of another drug even though the enhancing drug has no intrinsic toxic effect on that organ.

\section*{PREDI CTABI LI TY OF DRUG INTERACTI ONS}

The designations listed in Table II-1 will be used here to estimate the predictability of the drug interactions. These estimates are intended to indicate simply whether or not the interaction will occur and do not always mean that the interaction is likely to produce an adverse effect. Whether the interaction occurs and produces an adverse effect or not depends upon (1) the presence or absence of factors that predispose to the adverse effects of the drug interaction (diseases, organ function, dose of drugs, etc) and (2) awareness on the part of the prescriber, so that appropriate monitoring can be ordered or preventive measures taken.
