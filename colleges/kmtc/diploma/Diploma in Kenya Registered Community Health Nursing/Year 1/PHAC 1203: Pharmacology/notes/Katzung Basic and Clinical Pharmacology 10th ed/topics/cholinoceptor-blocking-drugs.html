                    <p>Cholinoceptor antagonists, like agonists, are divided into muscarinic and nicotinic subgroups on the basis of their specific receptor affinities. Ganglion-blockers and neuromuscular junction blockers comprise the antinicotinic drugs. The ganglion-blocking drugs have little clinical use and are discussed at the end of this chapter. The neuromuscular blockers are discussed in Chapter 27. This chapter emphasizes drugs that block muscarinic cholinoceptors.</p>
                    <p>Five subtypes of muscarinic receptors have been identified, primarily on the basis of data from ligandbinding and cDNA-cloning experiments (see Chapters 6 and 7). A standard terminology ( $M_{1}$ through $M_{5}$ ) for these subtypes is now in common use, and evidence, based mostly on selective agonists and antagonists, indicates that functional differences exist between several of these subtypes.</p>
                    <p>As suggested in Chapter 6, the $M_{1}$ receptor subtype is located on central nervous system neurons, sympathetic postganglionic cell bodies, and many presynaptic sites. $M_{2}$ receptors are located in the myocardium, smooth muscle organs, and some neuronal sites. $M_{3}$ receptors are most common on effector cell membranes, especially glandular and smooth muscle cells.</p>

                             <p>Muscarinic antagonists are sometimes called parasympatholytic because they block the effects of parasympathetic autonomic discharge. However, they do not "lyse" parasympathetic nerves, and they have some effects that are not predictable from block of the parasympathetic nervous system. For these reasons, the term "antimuscarinic" is preferable.</p>

                                    <p>Atropine and its naturally occurring congeners are tertiary amine alkaloid esters of tropic acid (Figure 8-1). Atropine (hyoscyamine) is found in the plant Atropa belladonna, or deadly nightshade, and in Datura stramonium, also known as jimsonweed (Jamestown weed), sacred Datura, or thorn apple. Scopolamine (hyoscine) occurs in Hyoscyamus niger, or henbane, as the I (-) stereoisomer. Naturally occurring atropine is I (-)-hyoscyamine, but the compound readily racemizes, so the commercial material is racemic d, Ihyoscyamine. The I (-) isomers of both alkaloids are at least 100 times more potent than the d(+) isomers.</p>

                                     <p>Atropine causes reversible (surmountable) blockade (see Chapter 2) of cholinomimetic actions at muscarinic receptors‚Äîie, blockade by a small dose of atropine can be overcome by a larger concentration of acetylcholine or equivalent muscarinic agonist. Mutation experiments suggest that aspartate in the receptor forms the characteristic bond with the nitrogen atom of acetylcholine; this amino acid is also required for binding of antimuscarinic drugs. When atropine binds to the muscarinic receptor, it prevents actions such as the release of inositol trisphosphate ( $\mathrm{I} \mathrm{P}_{3}$ ) and the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase that are caused by muscarinic agonists (see Chapter 7).</p>
                                    <p>The effectiveness of antimuscarinic drugs varies with the tissue and with the source of agonist. Tissues most sensitive to atropine are the salivary, bronchial, and sweat glands. Secretion of acid by the gastric parietal cells is the least sensitive. In most tissues, antimuscarinic agents block exogenously administered cholinoceptor agonists more effectively than endogenously released acetylcholine. This is because neurally released ACh is released close to the receptors in high concentration, effectively competing with the antagonist (ie, the mechanism is surmountable), whereas the receptor is not normally exposed to high concentrations of bloodborne muscarinic agonists. In addition, removal of autoinhibition, a negative feedback mechanism by which neural acetylcholine suppresses its own release, may also help explain the greater efficacy of antimuscarinic drugs against exogenous muscarinic stimulants.</p>
                                    <p>Atropine is highly selective for muscarinic receptors. Its potency at nicotinic receptors is much lower, and actions at nonmuscarinic receptors are generally undetectable clinically.</p>
                                    <p>Atropine does not distinguish between the $\mathrm{M}_{1}$, $\mathrm{M}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ subgroups of muscarinic receptors. In contrast, other antimuscarinic drugs are moderately selective for one or another of these subgroups (Table 8-1). Most synthetic antimuscarinic drugs are considerably less selective than atropine in interactions with nonmuscarinic receptors. For example, some quaternary amine antimuscarinic agents have significant ganglion-blocking actions, and others are potent histamine receptor blockers. The antimuscarinic effects of other agents, eg, antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs, have been mentioned. Their relative selectivity for muscarinic receptor subtypes has not been defined.</p>

                                             <p>In the doses usually used, atropine has minimal stimulant effects on the central nervous system, especially the parasympathetic medullary centers, and a slower, longer-lasting sedative effect on the brain.
                                                Scopolamine has more marked central effects, producing drowsiness when given in recommended dosages and amnesia in sensitive individuals.

                                            <p>The tremor of Parkinson's disease is reduced by centrally acting antimuscarinic drugs, and atropine‚Äîin the form of belladonna extract‚Äîwas one of the first drugs used in the therapy of this disease. As discussed in Chapter 28, parkinsonian tremor and rigidity seem to result from a relative excess of cholinergic activity because of a deficiency of dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia-striatum system. The combination of an antimuscarinic agent with a dopamine precursor drug (levodopa) can sometimes provide more effective therapy than either drug alone.</p>

This activation is blocked by topical atropine and other tertiary antimuscarinic drugs and results in unopposed sympathetic dilator activity and mydriasis (Figure 8-3). Dilated pupils were considered cosmetically desirable during the Renaissance and account for the name belladonna (Italian, "beautiful lady") applied to the plant and its active extract because of the use of the extract as eye drops during that time.</p>

                                            <p>The second important ocular effect of antimuscarinic drugs is to weaken contraction of the ciliary muscle, or cycloplegia.

                                             <p>The sinoatrial node is very sensitive to muscarinic receptor blockade. Moderate to high therapeutic doses of atropine cause tachycardia in the innervated and spontaneously beating heart by blockade of vagal slowing. However, lower doses often result in initial bradycardia before the effects of peripheral vagal block become manifest (Figure 8-4). This slowing may be due to block of prejunctional $M_{1}$ receptors (autoreceptors, see Chapter 6) on vagal postganglionic fibers that normally limit acetylcholine release in the sinus node and other tissues. The same mechanisms operate in the atrioventricular node; in the presence of high vagal tone, atropine can significantly reduce the PR interval of the electrocardiogram by blocking muscarinic receptors in the atrioventricular node. Muscarinic effects on atrial muscle are similarly blocked, but these effects are of no clinical significance except in atrial flutter and fibrillation. The ventricles are less affected by antimuscarinic drugs at therapeutic levels because of a lesser degree of muscarinic control. In toxic
                                                concentrations, the drugs can cause intraventricular conduction block that has been attributed to a local anesthetic action.</p>

                                            <p>Most blood vessels receive no direct innervation from the parasympathetic system. However, parasympathetic nerve stimulation dilates coronary arteries, and sympathetic cholinergic nerves cause vasodilation in the skeletal muscle vascular bed (see Chapter 6). Atropine can block this vasodilation. Furthermore, almost all vessels contain endothelial muscarinic receptors that mediate vasodilation (see Chapter 7). These receptors are readily blocked by antimuscarinic drugs. At toxic doses, and in some individuals at normal doses, antimuscarinic agents cause cutaneous vasodilation, especially in the upper portion of the body. The mechanism is unknown.</p>
                                            <p>The net cardiovascular effects of atropine in patients with normal hemodynamics are not dramatic: tachycardia may occur, but there is little effect on blood pressure. However, the cardiovascular effects of administered direct-acting muscarinic agonists are easily prevented.</p>

                                             <p>Both smooth muscle and secretory glands of the airway receive vagal innervation and contain muscarinic receptors. Even in normal individuals, administration of atropine can cause some bronchodilation and reduce secretion. The effect is more significant in patients with airway disease, although the antimuscarinic drugs are not as useful as the B-adrenoceptor stimulants in the treatment of asthma (see Chapter 20). The effectiveness of unselective antimuscarinic drugs in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is limited because block of autoinhibitory $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ receptors on postganglionic parasympathetic nerves can
                                                 oppose the bronchodilation caused by block of $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ receptors on airway smooth muscle. Nevertheless, antimuscarinic agents are valuable in some patients with asthma or COPD.</p>

                                             <p>Blockade of muscarinic receptors has dramatic effects on motility and some of the secretory functions of the gut. However, even complete muscarinic block cannot totally abolish activity in this organ system since local hormones and noncholinergic neurons in the enteric nervous system (see Chapters 6 and 63) also modulate gastrointestinal function. As in other tissues, exogenously administered muscarinic stimulants are more effectively blocked than the effects of parasympathetic (vagal) nerve activity. The removal of autoinhibition, a negative feedback mechanism by which neural acetylcholine suppresses its own release, might explain the greater efficacy of antimuscarinic drugs against exogenous muscarinic stimulants.</p>
                                            <p>Antimuscarinic drugs have marked effects on salivary secretion; dry mouth occurs frequently in patients taking antimuscarinic drugs for Parkinson's disease or urinary conditions (Figure 8-5). Gastric secretion is blocked less effectively: the volume and amount of acid, pepsin, and mucin are all reduced, but large doses of atropine may be required. Basal secretion is blocked more effectively than that stimulated by food, nicotine, or alcohol. Pirenzepine and a more potent analog, telenzepine, reduce gastric acid secretion with fewer adverse effects than atropine and other less selective agents. This results from a selective blockade of presynaptic excitatory muscarinic receptors on vagal nerve endings as suggested by their high ratio of $M_{1}$ to $M_{3}$ affinity (Table 8-1). Pirenzepine and telenzepine are investigational in the USA. Pancreatic and intestinal secretion are little affected by atropine; these processes are primarily under hormonal rather than vagal control.</p>

                                            <p>Gastrointestinal smooth muscle motility is affected from the stomach to the colon. In general, the walls of the viscera are relaxed, and both tone and propulsive movements are diminished. Therefore, gastric emptying time is prolonged, and intestinal transit time is lengthened. Diarrhea due to overdosage with parasympathomimetic agents is readily stopped, and even that caused by nonautonomic agents can usually be temporarily controlled. However, intestinal "paralysis" induced by antimuscarinic drugs is temporary; local mechanisms within the enteric nervous system will usually reestablish at least some peristalsis after 1-3 days of antimuscarinic drug therapy.</p>

                                            <p>Formerly, ophthalmic antimuscarinic drugs were selected from the tertiary amine subgroup to ensure good penetration after conjunctival application. Recent experiments in animals, however, suggest that glycopyrrolate, a quaternary agent, is as rapid in onset and as long-lasting as atropine.</p>
                                            <p>Antimuscarinic drugs should never be used for mydriasis unless cycloplegia or prolonged action is required. Alpha-adrenoceptor stimulant drugs, eg, phenylephrine, produce a short-lasting mydriasis that is usually sufficient for funduscopic examination (see Chapter 9).</p>

                                             <p>As described in Chapter 20, the hyperactive neural bronchoconstrictor reflex present in most individuals with asthma is mediated by the vagus, acting on muscarinic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells.
                                                I pratropium (Figure 8-2), a synthetic analog of atropine, is used as an inhalational drug in asthma. The aerosol route of administration has the advantages of maximal concentration at the bronchial target tissue with reduced systemic effects. This application is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 20. I pratropium has also proved useful in COPD, a condition that occurs with higher frequency in older patients, particularly chronic smokers. Patients with COPD benefit from bronchodilators, especially antimuscarinic agents such as ipratropium and the recently approved tiotropium. In contrast to ipratropium, tiotropium has a longer bronchodilator action and can be given once daily. Tiotropium reduces the incidence of COPD exacerbations and is a useful adjunct to pulmonary rehabilitation in increasing exercise tolerance.</p>
                                            <p>Antimuscarinic drugs are frequently used prior to administration of inhalant anesthetics to reduce the accumulation of secretions in the trachea and the possibility of laryngospasm.</p>

                                             <p>Marked reflex vagal discharge sometimes accompanies the pain of myocardial infarction (eg, vasovagal attack) and may depress sinoatrial or atrioventricular node function sufficiently to impair cardiac output. Parenteral atropine or a similar antimuscarinic drug is appropriate therapy in this situation. Rare individuals without other detectable cardiac disease have hyperactive carotid sinus reflexes and may experience faintness or even syncope as a result of vagal discharge in response to pressure on the neck, eg, from a tight collar. Such individuals may benefit from the judicious use of atropine or a related antimuscarinic agent.</p>
                                            <p>Pathophysiology can influence muscarinic activity in other ways as well. Circulating autoantibodies against the second extracellular loop of cardiac muscarinic receptors have been detected in some patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. These antibodies exert parasympathomimetic actions on the heart that are prevented by atropine. Although their role in the pathology of heart failure is unknown, they should provide clues to the molecular basis of receptor activation.</p>

Antimuscarinic agents can provide some relief in the treatment of common traveler's diarrhea and other mild or self-limited conditions of hypermotility. They are often combined with an opioid antidiarrheal drug, an extremely effective therapy. In this combination, however, the very low dosage of the antimuscarinic drug functions primarily to discourage abuse of the opioid agent. The classic combination of atropine with diphenoxylate, a nonanalgesic congener of meperidine, is available under many names (eg, Lomotil) in both tablet and liquid form (see Chapter 63).</p>

In the human urinary bladder, $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ receptors are expressed predominantly with the $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ subtype mediating direct activation of contraction. As in intestinal smooth muscle, the $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ subtype appears to act indirectly by inhibiting relaxation by norepinephrine and

                                             <p>Oxybutynin, which is somewhat selective for $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ receptors, is used to relieve bladder spasm after urologic surgery, eg, prostatectomy. It is also valuable in reducing involuntary voiding in patients with neurologic disease, eg, children with meningomyelocele. Oral oxybutynin or instillation of the drug by catheter into the bladder in such patients appears to improve bladder capacity and continence and to reduce infection and renal damage. Trospium, an unselective antagonist, has recently been approved and is comparable in efficacy and side effects with oxybutynin. Darifenacin and solifenacin are recently approved antagonists that have greater selectivity for $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ receptors than oxybutynin or trospium. Their advantages include once daily dosing because of their long half-lives and a reduced incidence of xerostomia and constipation.</p>
                                            <p>Tolterodine, another $\mathrm{M}_{3}$-selective antimuscarinic, is available for use in adults with urinary incontinence. It has many of the qualities of darifenacin and solifenacin. The reason for the reduced incidence of dry mouth with these drugs as compared with oxybutynin is not known.</p>
                                            <p>Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant drug with strong antimuscarinic actions, has long been used to reduce incontinence in institutionalized elderly patients. It is moderately effective but causes significant central nervous system toxicity. Propiverine, a newer antimuscarinic agent, has been approved for this purpose.</p>
                                            <p>Antimuscarinic agents have also been used in urolithiasis to relieve the painful ureteral smooth muscle spasm caused by passage of the stone. However, their usefulness in this condition is debatable.</p>

Unfortunately, there is no effective method for directly blocking the nicotinic effects of cholinesterase inhibition, because nicotinic agonists and antagonists cause blockade of transmission (see Chapter 27). To reverse the muscarinic effects, a tertiary (not quaternary) amine drug must be used (preferably atropine) to treat the central nervous system effects as well as the peripheral effects of the organophosphate inhibitors. Large doses of atropine may be needed to oppose the muscarinic effects of extremely potent agents like parathion and chemical warfare nerve gases: 1-2 mg of atropine sulfate may be given intravenously every 5-15 minutes until signs of effect (dry mouth, reversal of miosis) appear. The drug may have to be repeated many times, since the acute effects of the anticholinesterase agent may last for 24-48 hours or longer. In this life-threatening situation, as much as 1 g of atropine per day may be required for as long as 1 month for full control of muscarinic excess.</p>

                                                    <p>The oxime group ( =NOH ) has a very high affinity for the phosphorus atom, and these drugs can hydrolyze the phosphorylated enzyme if the complex has not "aged" (see Chapter 7). Pralidoxime is the most extensively studied‚Äîin humans‚Äîof the agents shown and the only one available for clinical use in the USA. It is most effective in regenerating the cholinesterase associated with skeletal muscle neuromuscular junctions. Pralidoxime is ineffective in reversing the central effects of organophosphate poisoning because its positive charge prevents entry into the central nervous system. Diacetylmonoxime, on the other hand, crosses the blood-brain barrier and, in experimental animals, can regenerate some of the central nervous system cholinesterase.</p>
                                                     <p>Pralidoxime is administered by intravenous infusion, 1-2 g given over 15-30 minutes. In spite of the likelihood of aging of the phosphate-enzyme complex, recent reports suggest that administration of multiple doses of pralidoxime over several days may be useful in severe poisoning. In excessive doses, pralidoxime can induce neuromuscular weakness and other adverse effects. Pralidoxime is not recommended for the reversal of inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by carbamate inhibitors. Further details of treatment of anticholinesterase toxicity are given in Chapter 59.</p>
                                                    <p>A third approach to protection against excessive AChE inhibition is pretreatment with reversible enzyme
                                                        inhibitors to prevent binding of the irreversible organophosphate inhibitor. This prophylaxis can be achieved with pyridostigmine or physostigmine but is reserved for situations in which possibly lethal poisoning is anticipated, eg, chemical warfare. Simultaneous use of atropine is required to control muscarinic excess.</p>
                                                    <p>Mushroom poisoning has traditionally been divided into rapid-onset and delayed-onset types. The rapidonset type is usually apparent within 15-30 minutes following ingestion of the mushrooms. It is often characterized entirely by signs of muscarinic excess: miosis, salivation, sweating, bronchial constriction, vomiting, and diarrhea. Although Amanita muscaria contains muscarine (the alkaloid was named after the mushroom), numerous other alkaloids, including antimuscarinic agents, are found in this fungus. In fact, ingestion of A muscaria may produce signs of atropine poisoning, not muscarine excess. Other mushrooms, especially those of the Inocybe genus, cause rapid-onset poisoning of the muscarinic excess type. Parenteral atropine, 1-2 mg, is effective treatment in such intoxications.</p>
                                                    <p>Delayed-onset mushroom poisoning, usually caused by Amanita phalloides, A virosa, Galerina autumnalis, or G marginata, manifests its first symptoms 6-12 hours after ingestion. Although the initial symptoms usually include nausea and vomiting, the major toxicity involves hepatic and renal cellular injury by amatoxins that inhibit RNA polymerase. Atropine is of no value in this form of mushroom poisoning (see Chapter 59).</p>

                                                     <p>The fatal dose of nicotine is approximately 40 mg , or 1 drop of the pure liquid. This is the amount of nicotine in two regular cigarettes. Fortunately, most of the nicotine in cigarettes is destroyed by burning or escapes via the "sidestream" smoke. Ingestion of nicotine insecticides or of tobacco by infants and children is usually followed by vomiting, limiting the amount of the alkaloid absorbed.</p>
                                                    <p>The toxic effects of a large dose of nicotine are simple extensions of the effects described previously. The most dangerous are (1) central stimulant actions, which cause convulsions and may progress to coma and respiratory arrest; (2) skeletal muscle end plate depolarization, which may lead to depolarization blockade and respiratory paralysis; and (3) hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias.</p>
                                                    <p>Treatment of acute nicotine poisoning is largely symptom-directed. Muscarinic excess resulting from parasympathetic ganglion stimulation can be controlled with atropine. Central stimulation is usually treated with parenteral anticonvulsants such as diazepam. Neuromuscular blockade is not responsive to pharmacologic treatment and may require mechanical respiration.</p>

However, the 1979 Surgeon General's Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention stated that "cigarette smoking is clearly the largest single preventable cause of illness and premature death in the United States." This statement has been supported by numerous subsequent studies. Unfortunately, the fact that the most important of the tobacco-associated diseases are delayed in onset reduces the health incentive to stop smoking.</p>
                                                    <p>Clearly, the addictive power of cigarettes is directly related to their nicotine content. It is not known to what extent nicotine per se contributes to the other well-documented adverse effects of chronic tobacco use. It appears highly probable that nicotine contributes to the increased risk of vascular disease and sudden coronary death associated with smoking. Also, nicotine probably contributes to the high incidence of ulcer recurrences in smokers with peptic ulcer.</p>

The major source of such intoxications is pesticide use in agriculture and in the home. Approximately 100 organophosphate and 20 carbamate cholinesterase inhibitors are available in pesticides and veterinary vermifuges used in the USA.</p>
                                            <p>Acute intoxication must be recognized and treated promptly in patients with heavy exposure. The dominant initial signs are those of muscarinic excess: miosis, salivation, sweating, bronchial constriction, vomiting, and diarrhea. Central nervous system involvement usually follows rapidly, accompanied by peripheral nicotinic effects, especially depolarizing neuromuscular blockade. Therapy always includes (1) maintenance of vital signs‚Äîrespiration in particular may be impaired; (2) decontamination to prevent further absorption‚Äîthis may require removal of all clothing and washing of the skin in cases of exposure to dusts and sprays; and (3) atropine parenterally in large doses, given as often as required to control signs of muscarinic excess. Therapy often also includes treatment with pralidoxime as described in Chapter 8.</p>
                                            <p>Chronic exposure to certain organophosphate compounds, including some organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitors, causes neuropathy associated with demyelination of axons.
