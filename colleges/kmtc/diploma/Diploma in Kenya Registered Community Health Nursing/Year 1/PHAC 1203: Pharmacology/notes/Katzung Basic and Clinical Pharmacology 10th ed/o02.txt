Atropine and other antimuscarinic drugs have been used to provide symptomatic relief in the treatment of urinary urgency caused by minor inflammatory bladder disorders (Table 8-3). However, specific antimicrobial therapy is essential in bacterial cystitis. In the human urinary bladder, $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ receptors are expressed predominantly with the $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ subtype mediating direct activation of contraction. As in intestinal smooth muscle, the $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ subtype appears to act indirectly by inhibiting relaxation by norepinephrine and
epinephrine.

Oxybutynin, which is somewhat selective for $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ receptors, is used to relieve bladder spasm after urologic surgery, eg, prostatectomy. It is also valuable in reducing involuntary voiding in patients with neurologic disease, eg, children with meningomyelocele. Oral oxybutynin or instillation of the drug by catheter into the bladder in such patients appears to improve bladder capacity and continence and to reduce infection and renal damage. Trospium, an unselective antagonist, has recently been approved and is comparable in efficacy and side effects with oxybutynin. Darifenacin and solifenacin are recently approved antagonists that have greater selectivity for $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ receptors than oxybutynin or trospium. Their advantages include once daily dosing because of their long half-lives and a reduced incidence of xerostomia and constipation.
Tolterodine, another $\mathrm{M}_{3}$-selective antimuscarinic, is available for use in adults with urinary incontinence. It has many of the qualities of darifenacin and solifenacin. The reason for the reduced incidence of dry mouth with these drugs as compared with oxybutynin is not known.

Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant drug with strong antimuscarinic actions, has long been used to reduce incontinence in institutionalized elderly patients. It is moderately effective but causes significant central nervous system toxicity. Propiverine, a newer antimuscarinic agent, has been approved for this purpose.

Antimuscarinic agents have also been used in urolithiasis to relieve the painful ureteral smooth muscle spasm caused by passage of the stone. However, their usefulness in this condition is debatable.

\section*{CHOLINERGIC POISONING}

Severe cholinergic excess is a medical emergency, especially in rural communities where cholinesterase
inhibitor insecticides are commonly used and in cultures where wild mushrooms are commonly eaten. The potential use of cholinesterase inhibitors as chemical warfare "nerve gases" also requires an awareness of the methods for treating acute poisoning (see Chapter 59).

\section*{Antimuscarinic Therapy}

As noted in Chapter 7, both the nicotinic and the muscarinic effects of the cholinesterase inhibitors can be life-threatening. Unfortunately, there is no effective method for directly blocking the nicotinic effects of cholinesterase inhibition, because nicotinic agonists and antagonists cause blockade of transmission (see Chapter 27). To reverse the muscarinic effects, a tertiary (not quaternary) amine drug must be used (preferably atropine) to treat the central nervous system effects as well as the peripheral effects of the organophosphate inhibitors. Large doses of atropine may be needed to oppose the muscarinic effects of extremely potent agents like parathion and chemical warfare nerve gases: $1-2 \mathrm{mg}$ of atropine sulfate may be given intravenously every 5-15 minutes until signs of effect (dry mouth, reversal of miosis) appear. The drug may have to be repeated many times, since the acute effects of the anticholinesterase agent may last for 24-48 hours or longer. In this life-threatening situation, as much as 1 g of atropine per day may be required for as long as 1 month for full control of muscarinic excess.

\section*{Cholinesterase Regenerator Compounds}

A second class of compounds, capable of regenerating active enzyme from the organophosphoruscholinesterase complex, is also available to treat organophosphorus poisoning. These oxime agents include pralidoxime (PAM), diacetylmonoxime (DAM), and others.
<smiles>C[n+]1ccccc1C=N</smiles>

Pralidoxime
<smiles>CC(=N)C(C)=O</smiles>

Diacetylmonoxime

The oxime group ( $=\mathrm{NOH}$ ) has a very high affinity for the phosphorus atom, and these drugs can hydrolyze the phosphorylated enzyme if the complex has not "aged" (see Chapter 7). Pralidoxime is the most extensively studied-in humans-of the agents shown and the only one available for clinical use in the USA. It is most effective in regenerating the cholinesterase associated with skeletal muscle neuromuscular junctions. Pralidoxime is ineffective in reversing the central effects of organophosphate poisoning because its positive charge prevents entry into the central nervous system. Diacetylmonoxime, on the other hand, crosses the blood-brain barrier and, in experimental animals, can regenerate some of the central nervous system cholinesterase.

Pralidoxime is administered by intravenous infusion, 1-2 g given over 15-30 minutes. In spite of the likelihood of aging of the phosphate-enzyme complex, recent reports suggest that administration of multiple doses of pralidoxime over several days may be useful in severe poisoning. In excessive doses, pralidoxime can induce neuromuscular weakness and other adverse effects. Pralidoxime is not recommended for the reversal of inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by carbamate inhibitors. Further details of treatment of anticholinesterase toxicity are given in Chapter 59.

A third approach to protection against excessive AChE inhibition is pretreatment with reversible enzyme
inhibitors to prevent binding of the irreversible organophosphate inhibitor. This prophylaxis can be achieved with pyridostigmine or physostigmine but is reserved for situations in which possibly lethal poisoning is anticipated, eg, chemical warfare. Simultaneous use of atropine is required to control muscarinic excess.

Mushroom poisoning has traditionally been divided into rapid-onset and delayed-onset types. The rapidonset type is usually apparent within 15-30 minutes following ingestion of the mushrooms. It is often characterized entirely by signs of muscarinic excess: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, urinary urgency, vasodilation, reflex tachycardia (occasionally bradycardia), sweating, salivation, and sometimes bronchoconstriction. Although Amanita muscaria contains muscarine (the alkaloid was named after the mushroom), numerous other alkaloids, including antimuscarinic agents, are found in this fungus. In fact, ingestion of A muscaria may produce signs of atropine poisoning, not muscarine excess. Other mushrooms, especially those of the Inocybe genus, cause rapid-onset poisoning of the muscarinic excess type. Parenteral atropine, $1-2 \mathrm{mg}$, is effective treatment in such intoxications.

Delayed-onset mushroom poisoning, usually caused by Amanita phalloides, A virosa, Galerina autumnalis, or G marginata, manifests its first symptoms 6-12 hours after ingestion. Although the initial symptoms usually include nausea and vomiting, the major toxicity involves hepatic and renal cellular injury by amatoxins that inhibit RNA polymerase. Atropine is of no value in this form of mushroom poisoning (see Chapter 59).

\section*{OTHER APPLICATIONS}

Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) is sometimes reduced by antimuscarinic agents. However, relief is incomplete at best, probably because apocrine rather than eccrine glands are usually involved.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Treatment with atropine or its congeners directed at one organ system almost always induces undesirable effects in other organ systems. Thus, mydriasis and cycloplegia are adverse effects when an antimuscarinic agent is used to reduce gastrointestinal secretion or motility, even though they are therapeutic effects when the drug is used in ophthalmology.

At higher concentrations, atropine causes block of all parasympathetic functions. However, atropine is a remarkably safe drug in adults. Atropine poisoning has occurred as a result of attempted suicide, but most cases are due to attempts to induce hallucinations. Poisoned individuals manifest dry mouth, mydriasis, tachycardia, hot and flushed skin, agitation, and delirium for as long as a week. Body temperature is frequently elevated. These effects are memorialized in the adage, "dry as a bone, blind as a bat, red as a beet, mad as a hatter."

Unfortunately, children, especially infants, are very sensitive to the hyperthermic effects of atropine. Although accidental administration of over 400 mg has been followed by recovery, deaths have followed doses as small as 2 mg . Therefore, atropine should be considered a highly dangerous drug when overdose occurs in infants or children.

Overdoses of atropine or its congeners are generally treated symptomatically (see Chapter 59). In the past, physostigmine or another cholinesterase inhibitor was recommended, but most poison control experts now consider physostigmine more dangerous and no more effective in most patients than symptomatic management. When physostigmine is deemed necessary, small doses are given slowly intravenously (1-4 mg in adults, $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg}$ in children). Symptomatic treatment may require temperature control with cooling blankets and seizure control with diazepam.

Poisoning caused by high doses of quaternary antimuscarinic drugs is associated with all of the peripheral signs of parasympathetic blockade but few or none of the central nervous system effects of atropine. These more polar drugs may cause significant ganglionic blockade, however, with marked orthostatic hypotension (see below). Treatment of the antimuscarinic effects, if required, can be carried out with a quaternary cholinesterase inhibitor such as neostigmine. Control of hypotension may require the administration of a sympathomimetic drug such as phenylephrine.

\section*{Contraindications}

Contraindications to the use of antimuscarinic drugs are relative, not absolute. Obvious muscarinic excess, especially that caused by cholinesterase inhibitors, can always be treated with atropine.

Antimuscarinic drugs are contraindicated in patients with glaucoma, especially angle-closure glaucoma. Even systemic use of moderate doses may precipitate angle closure (and acute glaucoma) in patients with shallow anterior chambers.

In elderly men, antimuscarinic drugs should always be used with caution and should be avoided in those with a history of prostatic hyperplasia.

Because the antimuscarinic drugs slow gastric emptying, they may increase symptoms in patients with gastric ulcer. Nonselective antimuscarinic agents should never be used to treat acid-peptic disease (see Chapter 63).

\section*{BASIC \& CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF THE GANGLI ON-BLOCKI NG DRUGS}

These agents competitively block the action of acetylcholine and similar agonists at nicotinic receptors of both parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic ganglia. Some members of the group also block the ion channel that is gated by the nicotinic cholinoceptor. The ganglion-blocking drugs are important and used in pharmacologic and physiologic research because they can block all autonomic outflow. However, their lack of selectivity confers such a broad range of undesirable effects that they have limited clinical use.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

All ganglion-blocking drugs of interest are synthetic amines. Tetraethylammonium (TEA), the first to be recognized as having this action, has a very short duration of action. Hexamethonium ("C6") was developed and was introduced clinically as the first drug effective for management of hypertension. As shown in Figure 8-6, there is an obvious relationship between the structures of the agonist acetylcholine and the nicotinic antagonists tetraethylammonium and hexamethonium. Decamethonium, the "C10" analog of hexamethonium, is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent.

Acetylcholine

Some ganglion-blocking drugs. Acetylcholine is shown for reference.

Mecamylamine, a secondary amine, was developed to improve the degree and extent of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract because the quaternary amine ganglion-blocking compounds were poorly and erratically absorbed after oral administration. Trimethaphan, a short-acting ganglion blocker, is inactive orally and is given by intravenous infusion.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

\section*{MECHANI SM OF ACTI ON}

Ganglionic nicotinic receptors, like those of the skeletal muscle neuromuscular junction, are subject to both depolarizing and nondepolarizing blockade (see Chapters 7 and 27). Nicotine itself, carbamoylcholine, and even acetylcholine (if amplified with a cholinesterase inhibitor) can produce depolarizing ganglion block.

Drugs now used as ganglion blockers are classified as nondepolarizing competitive antagonists. However, hexamethonium actually produces most of its blockade by occupying sites in or on the nicotinic ion channel, not by occupying the cholinoceptor itself. In contrast, trimethaphan appears to block the nicotinic receptor, not the channel. Blockade can be surmounted by increasing the concentration of an agonist, eg, acetylcholine.

\section*{ORGAN SYSTEM EFFECTS}

\section*{Central Nervous System}

Mecamylamine, unlike the quaternary amine agents and trimethaphan, crosses the blood-brain barrier and readily enters the central nervous system. Sedation, tremor, choreiform movements, and mental aberrations have been reported as effects of mecamylamine.

\section*{Eye}

The ganglion-blocking drugs cause a predictable cycloplegia with loss of accommodation because the ciliary muscle receives innervation primarily from the parasympathetic nervous system. The effect on the pupil is not so easily predicted, since the iris receives both sympathetic innervation (mediating pupillary dilation) and parasympathetic innervation (mediating pupillary constriction). Ganglionic blockade often causes moderate dilation of the pupil because parasympathetic tone usually dominates this tissue.

\section*{Cardiovascular System}

Blood vessels receive chiefly vasoconstrictor fibers from the sympathetic nervous system; therefore, ganglionic blockade causes a marked decrease in arteriolar and venomotor tone. The blood pressure may fall precipitously, because both peripheral vascular resistance and venous return are decreased (see Figure 6-7). Hypotension is especially marked in the upright position (orthostatic or postural hypotension), because postural reflexes that normally prevent venous pooling are blocked.

Cardiac effects include diminished contractility and, because the sinoatrial node is usually dominated by the parasympathetic nervous system, a moderate tachycardia.

\section*{Gastrointestinal Tract}

Secretion is reduced, although not enough to effectively treat peptic disease. Motility is profoundly inhibited, and constipation can be marked.

\section*{Other Systems}

Genitourinary smooth muscle is partially dependent on autonomic innervation for normal function. Therefore, ganglionic blockade causes hesitancy in urination and may precipitate urinary retention in men with prostatic hyperplasia. Sexual function is impaired in that both erection and ejaculation may be prevented by moderate doses.

Thermoregulatory sweating is reduced by the ganglion-blocking drugs. However, hyperthermia is not a problem except in very warm environments, because cutaneous vasodilation is usually sufficient to maintain a normal body temperature.

\section*{Response to Autonomic Drugs}

Patients receiving ganglion-blocking drugs are fully responsive to autonomic drugs acting on muscarinic, a.-, and B -adrenergic receptors because these effector cell receptors are not blocked. In fact, responses may be exaggerated or even reversed (eg, norepinephrine may cause tachycardia rather than bradycardia), because homeostatic reflexes, which normally moderate autonomic responses, are absent.

\section*{Clinical Applications \& Toxicity}

Use of the ganglion blockers is infrequent because more selective autonomic blocking agents are available. Mecamylamine is being studied for possible use in reducing nicotine craving in patients attempting to quit smoking and for some other central indications. Trimethaphan is occasionally used in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies and dissecting aortic aneurysm; to produce controlled hypotension, which can be of value in neurosurgery to reduce bleeding in the operative field; and in patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy. The toxicity of the ganglion-blocking drugs is limited to the autonomic effects already described. For most patients, these effects are intolerable except for acute use.

\section*{ADRENOCEPTOR-ACTI VATI NG \& OTHER SYMPATHOMI METI C DRUGS: I NTRODUCTION}

The sympathetic nervous system is an important regulator of the activities of organs such as the heart and peripheral vasculature, especially in responses to stress (see Chapter 6). The ultimate effects of sympathetic stimulation are mediated by release from nerve terminals of norepinephrine that serves to activate the adrenoceptors on postsynaptic sites. Also, in response to a variety of stimuli such as stress, the adrenal medulla releases epinephrine, which is transported in the blood to target tissues; in other words, epinephrine acts as a hormone. Drugs that mimic the actions of epinephrine or norepinephrine-sympathomimetic drugs -would be expected to have a wide range of effects. An understanding of the pharmacology of these agents is thus a logical extension of what we know about the physiologic role of the catecholamines.

\section*{The Mode \& Spectrum of Action of Sympathomimetic Drugs}

Like the cholinomimetic drugs, the sympathomimetics can be grouped by mode of action and by the spectrum of receptors that they activate. Some of these drugs (eg, norepinephrine and epinephrine) act by a direct mode; that is, they directly interact with and activate adrenoceptors. Others act indirectly ; their actions are dependent on the release of endogenous catecholamines. These indirect agents may have either of two different mechanisms: (1) displacement of stored catecholamines from the adrenergic nerve ending (eg, amphetamine and tyramine) or (2) inhibition of reuptake of catecholamines already released (eg, cocaine and tricyclic antidepressants). Some drugs have both direct and indirect actions. Both types of sympathomimetics, direct and indirect, ultimately cause activation of adrenoceptors, leading to some or all of the characteristic effects of endogenous catecholamines. The selectivity of different sympathomimetics for various types of adrenoceptors is discussed below.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF SYMPATHOMI METI C DRUGS I DENTI FI CATI ON OF ADRENOCEPTORS}

The effort to understand the molecular mechanisms by which catecholamines act has a long and rich history. A great conceptual debt is owed to the work done by John Langley and Paul Ehrlich 100 years ago in developing the hypothesis that drugs have their effects by interacting with specific "receptive" substances. Raymond Ahlquist in 1948 rationalized a large body of observations by his conjecture that catecholamines acted via two principal receptors. He termed these receptors cand B. Alpha receptors are those that have the comparative potencies epinephrine $\geq$ norepinephrine $\gg$ isoproterenol. Beta receptors have the comparative potencies isoproterenol > epinephrine $\equiv$ norepinephrine. Ahlquist's hypothesis was dramatically confirmed by the development of drugs that selectively antagonize Breceptors but not $a$. receptors (see Chapter 10). More recent evidence suggests that areceptors comprise two major families. At present, therefore, it appears appropriate to classify adrenoceptors into three major groups, namely, $\beta, \alpha_{1}$ , and $x_{2}$ receptors. Each of these major groups of receptors also has three subtypes. Considerable effort has been expended in elucidating structure-function relationships that determine ligand binding properties and the molecular signaling characteristics of the various adrenergic receptors.

\section*{BETA ADRENOCEPTORS}

Soon after the demonstration of separate and Breceptors, it was found that there were at least two
subtypes of Breceptors, designated $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$. These subtypes are operationally defined by their affinities for epinephrine and norepinephrine: $B_{1}$ receptors have approximately equal affinity for epinephrine and norepinephrine, whereas $B_{2}$ receptors have a higher affinity for epinephrine than for norepinephrine. Subsequently, $B_{3}$ receptors were identified as a novel and distinct third $B$-adrenoceptor subtype. These receptor types are listed in Table 9-1.

\section*{ALPHA ADRENOCEPTORS}

Following the demonstration of the Bsubtypes, two major groups of areceptors were found: $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$. These receptors were originally identified with antagonist drugs that distinguished between $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$ receptors. For example, cadrenoceptors were identified in a variety of tissues by measuring the binding of radiolabeled antagonist compounds that are considered to have a high affinity for these receptors, eg, dihydroergocryptine ( $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$ ), prazosin ( $\alpha_{1}$ ), and yohimbine ( $\alpha_{2}$ ). These radioligands were used to measure the number of receptors in tissues and to determine the affinity (by displacement of the radiolabeled ligand) of other drugs that interact with the receptors.

The concept of subtypes within the group emerged out of pharmacologic experiments that demonstrated complex shapes of agonist dose-response curves of smooth muscle contraction as well as differences in antagonist affinities in inhibiting contractile responses in various tissues. These experiments demonstrated the existence of two subtypes of 1 receptor that could be distinguished on the basis of their reversible affinities for a variety of drugs and experimental compounds. A third $\alpha_{1}$-receptor subtype was subsequently identified by molecular cloning techniques. These $Q_{1}$ receptors are termed $Q_{1 \mathrm{~A}}$, and $Q_{1 \mathrm{~B}}$ receptors. There is evidence that the $Q_{1 \mathrm{~A}}$ receptor has splice variants. A major current area of investigation is determining the importance of each of these various subtypes in mediating $\alpha_{1}$-receptor responses in a variety of organs.

The hypothesis that there are subtypes of $\alpha_{2}$ receptors emerged from pharmacologic experiments and molecular cloning. It is now known that there are three subtypes of $\alpha_{2}$ receptors, termed $\alpha_{2 A}$, $\alpha_{2 B}$, and $\alpha_{2}$. 2c, which are products of distinct genes.

\section*{DOPAMINE RECEPTORS}

The endogenous catecholamine dopamine produces a variety of biologic effects that are mediated by interactions with specific dopamine receptors (Table 9-1). These receptors are distinct from cand $B$
receptors and are particularly important in the brain (see Chapters 21 and 29) and in the splanchnic and renal vasculature. There is now considerable evidence for the existence of at least five subtypes of dopamine receptors. Pharmacologically distinct dopamine receptor subtypes, termed $\mathrm{D}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{D}_{2}$, have been known for some time. Molecular cloning has identified several distinct genes encoding each of these subtypes. Further complexity occurs because of the presence of introns within the coding region of the $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ like receptor genes, which allows for alternative splicing of the exons in this major subtype. There is extensive polymorphic variation in the $\mathrm{D}_{4}$ human receptor gene. The terminology of the various subtypes is $D_{1}, D_{2}, D_{3}, D_{4}$, and $D_{5}$. They comprise two $D_{1}$-like receptors ( $D_{1}$ and $D_{5}$ ) and three $D_{2}$-like ( $D_{2}, D_{3}$, and $\mathrm{D}_{4}$ ). These subtypes may have importance for understanding the efficacy and adverse effects of novel antipsychotic drugs (see Chapter 29).

\section*{Receptor Selectivity}

Examples of clinically useful sympathomimetic agonists that are relatively selective for $\alpha_{1}-\alpha_{2}-$, and $B$ adrenoceptor subgroups are compared with some nonselective agents in Table 9-2. Selectivity means that a drug may preferentially bind to one subgroup of receptors at concentrations too low to interact extensively with another subgroup. For example, norepinephrine preferentially activates $B_{1}$ receptors compared with $B_{2}$ receptors. However, selectivity is not usually absolute (nearly absolute selectivity has been termed "specificity"), and at higher concentrations related classes of receptor may also interact with the drug. As a result, the "numeric" subclassification of adrenoceptors is clinically important mainly for drugs that have relatively marked selectivity. Given interpatient variations in drug kinetics and dynamics, the extent of a drug's selectivity should be kept in mind if this property is viewed as clinically important in the treatment of an individual patient.

The exact number of adrenoceptor subtypes that are actually expressed in human tissues is uncertain, but expression of subtypes has been demonstrated in tissues in which the physiologic or pharmacologic importance of the subtype is not yet known. These results suggest the possibility of designing novel drugs to exploit the expression of a particular receptor subtype in a single target tissue. For example, determining which blood vessels express which subtypes of $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$ receptors could lead to design of drugs having selectivity for certain vascular beds such as the splanchnic or coronary vessels. Similarly, there has been extensive investigation into the $x_{1}$-receptor subtypes mediating pharmacologic responses in the human prostate (see Receptor Selectivity and Physiologic Functions of Adrenoceptor Subtypes).

\section*{Receptor Selectivity and Physiologic Functions of Adrenoceptor Subtypes: Lessons from Knockout Mice}

Since pharmacologic tools used to evaluate the function of adrenoceptor subtypes have some limitations, a number of knockout mice have been developed with one or more adrenoceptor genes subjected to loss of function mutations, as described in Chapter 1 (see Pharmacology \& Genetics). These models have their
own complexities and extrapolations from mice to humans may be uncertain. Nonetheless, these studies have yielded some novel insights. For example, a-adrenoceptor subtypes play an important role in cardiac responses, the 2 A -adrenoceptor subtype is critical in transducing the effects of $a_{2}$ agonists on blood pressure control, and $B_{1}$ receptors play a predominant role in directly increasing heart rate in mouse heart.

\section*{MOLECULAR MECHANI SMS OF SYMPATHOMI METI C ACTI ON}

The effects of catecholamines are mediated by cell surface receptors. As described in Chapter 2, these GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors) are coupled by G proteins to the various effector proteins whose activities are regulated by those receptors. Each $G$ protein is a heterotrimer consisting of $a$, $B$, and $\gamma$ subunits. G proteins are classified on the basis of their distinctive asubunits. G proteins of particular importance for adrenoceptor function include $\mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{s}}$, the stimulatory G protein of adenylyl cyclase; $\mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{i}}$, the inhibitory G protein of adenylyl cyclase; and $\mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{q}}$, the protein coupling areceptors to phospholipase C. The activation of G protein-coupled receptors by catecholamines promotes the dissociation of GDP from the as subunit of the appropriate G protein. GTP then binds to this G protein, and the asubunit dissociates from the B- $\gamma$ unit. The activated GTP-bound asubunit then regulates the activity of its effector. Effectors of adrenoceptor-activated asubunits include adenylyl cyclase, cGMP phosphodiesterase, phospholipase C, and ion channels. The asubunit is inactivated by hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP and phosphate, and the subsequent reassociation of the asubunit with the $B-\gamma$ subunit. The $B-\gamma$ subunits have additional independent effects, acting on a variety of effectors such as ion channels and enzymes.

\section*{Receptor Types}

\section*{ALPHA RECEPTORS}

Alpha $_{1}$ receptors are coupled to polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis, leading to the formation of inositol 1,4,5trisphosphate (I P3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) (Table 9-1, Figure 9-1). G proteins in the $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{q}}$ family couple ${ }_{1}$ receptors to phospholipase C . IP 3 promotes the release of sequestered $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores, which increases the cytoplasmic concentration of free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and the activation of various calciumdependent protein kinases. Activation of these receptors may also increase influx of calcium across the cell's plasma membrane. IP 3 is sequentially dephosphorylated, which ultimately leads to the formation of free inositol. DAG activates protein kinase C, which modulates activity of many signaling pathways. In addition, $x_{1}$ receptors activate signal transduction pathways that were originally described for peptide growth factor receptors that activate tyrosine kinases. For example, $Q_{1}$ receptors have been found to activate mitogen-activated kinases (MAP kinases) and polyphosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI-3-kinase). These pathways may have importance for the $c_{1}$-receptor-mediated stimulation of cell growth and proliferation through the regulation of gene expression. The physiologic significance of this "cross talk" between major signaling pathways remains to be determined.

Activation of $Q_{1}$ responses. Stimulation of $Q_{1}$ receptors by catecholamines leads to the activation of a $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{q}}$-coupling protein. The activated asubunit ( $\alpha_{\mathrm{q}} *$ ) of this G protein activates the effector, phospholipase C , which leads to the release of IP ${ }_{3}$ (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) and DAG (diacylglycerol) from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns 4,5-P ${ }_{2}$ ). IP ${ }_{3}$ stimulates the release of sequestered stores of calcium, leading to an increased concentration of cytoplasmic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ may then activate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent protein kinases, which in turn phosphorylate their substrates. DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). See text for additional effects of $Q_{1}$-receptor activation.

Alpha ${ }_{2}$ receptors inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity and cause intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels to decrease. In addition to this well-documented effect, $\alpha_{2}$ receptors utilize other signaling pathways, including regulation of ion channel activities and the activities of important enzymes involved in signal transduction. $a_{2}$-receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity is transduced by the inhibitory regulatory protein, $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{i}}$ (Figure 9-2). How the activation of $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{i}}$ leads to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase is unclear, but it is likely that both a and the $B-\gamma$ subunits of $G_{i}$ contribute to this response. In addition, some of the effects of $a_{2}$ adrenoceptors are independent of their ability to inhibit adenylyl cyclase; for example, $\alpha_{2}$-receptor agonists cause platelet aggregation and a decrease in platelet cAMP levels, but it is not clear whether aggregation is the result of the decrease in cAMP or other mechanisms involving $G_{i}$ regulated effectors.

Alphaz -adrenoceptor ligands inhibit adenylyl cyclase by causing dissociation of the inhibitory G protein, $G_{i}$, into its subunits; ie, an activated $Q_{i}$ subunit charged with GTP and a Brunit. The mechanism by which these subunits inhibit adenylyl cyclase is uncertain. CAMP binds to the regulatory subunit (R) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, leading to the liberation of active catalytic subunits (C) that phosphorylate specific protein substrates and modify their activity. These catalytic units also phosphorylate the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which modifies gene expression. See text for other actions of $B$ and $\alpha_{2}$ adrenoceptors.

\section*{BETA RECEPTORS}

The mechanism of action of Bagonists has been studied in considerable detail. Activation of all three receptor subtypes ( $B_{1}, B_{2}$, and $B_{3}$ ) results in activation of adenylyl cyclase and increased conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cAMP (Table 9-1, Figure 9-2). Activation of the cyclase enzyme is mediated by the stimulatory coupling protein $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$. cAMP is the major second messenger of B-receptor activation. For example, in the liver of many species, $B$-receptor activation increases cAMP synthesis, which leads to a cascade of events culminating in the activation of glycogen phosphorylase. In the heart, Breceptor activation increases the influx of calcium across the cell membrane and its sequestration inside the cell. Beta-receptor activation also promotes the relaxation of smooth muscle. Although the mechanism of the smooth muscle effect is uncertain, it may involve the phosphorylation of myosin light-chain kinase to an
inactive form (see Figure 12-1). Beta adrenoceptors may activate voltage-sensitive calcium channels in the heart via $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$-mediated enhancement independently of changes in cAMP concentration. Under certain circumstances, $B_{2}$ receptors may couple to $G_{q}$ proteins. These receptors have been demonstrated to activate additional kinases, such as MAP kinases, by forming multi-subunit complexes within cells, which contain multiple signaling molecules. In addition, recent evidence suggests that formation of dimers of $B$ receptors themselves (both homodimers and heterodimers of $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ receptors) is prominently involved in their signaling mechanisms. Moreover, agonist activation of Breceptors promotes the association of several different proteins with these receptors, leading to activation of novel, additional signal pathways that regulate complex intracellular functions. Similarly, additional proteins interact directly with $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$ receptors, leading to further physiologic responses at a cellular level.

\section*{DOPAMINE RECEPTORS}

The $D_{1}$ receptor is typically associated with the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (Table 9-1); for example, $D_{1}$ -receptor-induced smooth muscle relaxation is presumably due to cAMP accumulation in the smooth muscle of those vascular beds in which dopamine is a vasodilator. $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ receptors have been found to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity, open potassium channels, and decrease calcium influx.

\section*{Receptor Regulation}

Responses mediated by adrenoceptors are not fixed and static. The number and function of adrenoceptors on the cell surface and their responses may be regulated by catecholamines themselves, other hormones and drugs, age, and a number of disease states (see Chapter 2). These changes may modify the magnitude of a tissue's physiologic response to catecholamines and can be important clinically during the course of treatment. One of the best-studied examples of receptor regulation is the desensitization of adrenoceptors that may occur after exposure to catecholamines and other sympathomimetic drugs. After a cell or tissue has been exposed for a period of time to an agonist, that tissue often becomes less responsive to further stimulation by that agent. Other terms such as tolerance, refractoriness, and tachyphylaxis have also been used to denote desensitization. This process has potential clinical significance because it may limit the therapeutic response to sympathomimetic agents.

Many mechanisms have been found to contribute to desensitization. Operating at transcriptional, translational, and protein levels, some mechanisms function relatively slowly-over the course of hours or days. Other mechanisms of desensitization occur quickly, within minutes. Rapid modulation of receptor function in desensitized cells may involve critical covalent modification of the receptor, especially by phosphorylation on specific amino acid residues, association of these receptors with other proteins, or changes in their subcellular location.

There are two major categories of desensitization of responses mediated by G protein-coupled receptors.
Homologous desensitization refers to loss of responsiveness exclusively of the receptors that have been exposed to repeated or sustained activation by a drug. Heterologous desensitization refers to loss of responsiveness of some cell surface receptors that have not been directly activated by the drug in question.

A major mechanism of desensitization that occurs rapidly involves phosphorylation of receptors by members of the $\mathbf{G}$ protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) family, of which there are at least seven members. Specific adrenoceptors are substrates for these kinases only when they are bound to an agonist. This mechanism is an example of homologous desensitization because it specifically involves only agonistoccupied receptors.

Phosphorylation of these receptors enhances their affinity for Barrestins; upon binding of a B-arrestin molecule, the capacity of the receptor to activate $G$ proteins is blunted, presumably due to steric hindrance (see Figure 2-12). Arrestins constitute another large family of widely expressed proteins. Receptor phosphorylation followed by $B$-arrestin binding has been linked to subsequent endocytosis of the receptor. This response may be facilitated by the capacity of Barrestins to bind to the structural protein clathrin. In addition to blunting responses requiring the presence of the receptor on the cell surface, these regulatory processes may also contribute to novel mechanisms of receptor signaling via intracellular pathways.

Receptor desensitization may also be mediated by second-messenger feedback. For example, $B$ adrenoceptors stimulate cAMP accumulation, which leads to activation of protein kinase A; protein kinase A can phosphorylate residues on Breceptors, resulting in inhibition of receptor function. For the $B_{2}$ receptor, phosphorylation occurs on serine residues both in the third cytoplasmic loop and in the carboxyl terminal tail of the receptor. Similarly, activation of protein kinase C by $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{q}}$-coupled receptors may lead to phosphorylation of this class of G protein-coupled receptors. This second-messenger feedback mechanism has been termed heterologous desensitization because activated protein kinase A or protein kinase C may phosphorylate any structurally similar receptor with the appropriate consensus sites for phosphorylation by these enzymes.

\section*{ADRENOCEPTOR POLYMORPHISMS}

Since elucidation of the sequences of the genes encoding the $\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}$, and Bsubtypes of adrenoceptors, it has become clear that there are relatively common genetic polymorphisms for many of these receptor subtypes in humans. Some of these may lead to changes in critical amino acid sequences that have pharmacologic importance. There is evidence that some of these polymorphisms may change the susceptibility to diseases such as heart failure, alter the propensity of a receptor to desensitize, and alter therapeutic responses to drugs in diseases such as asthma.

\section*{CHEMI STRY \& PHARMACOKI NETI CS OF SYMPATHOMI METIC DRUGS}

Phenylethylamine may be considered the parent compound from which sympathomimetic drugs are derived (Figure 9-3). This compound consists of a benzene ring with an ethylamine side chain. Substitutions may be made (1) on the terminal amino group, (2) on the benzene ring, and (3) on the aror Bcarbons. Substitution by -OH groups at the 3 and 4 positions yields sympathomimetic drugs collectively known as catecholamines. The effects of modification of phenylethylamine are to change the affinity of the drugs for $a$. and Breceptors as well as to influence the intrinsic ability to activate the receptors. In addition, chemical structure determines the pharmacokinetic properties of these molecules. Sympathomimetic drugs may activate both and Breceptors; however, the relative a.receptor versus B-receptor activity spans the range from almost pure activity (methoxamine) to almost pure Bactivity (isoproterenol).

\section*{SUBSTITUTION ON THE AMI NO GROUP}

Increasing the size of alkyl substituents on the amino group tends to increase $B$-receptor activity. For example, methyl substitution on norepinephrine, yielding epinephrine, enhances activity at $B_{2}$ receptors. Beta activity is further enhanced with isopropyl substitution at the amino nitrogen (isoproterenol). Betaz selective agonists generally require a large amino substituent group. The larger the substituent on the amino group, the lower the activity at areceptors; for example, isoproterenol is very weak at areceptors.

\section*{SUBSTITUTION ON THE BENZENE RING}

Maximal cand Bactivity is found with catecholamines (drugs having - OH groups at the 3 and 4 positions). The absence of one or the other of these groups, particularly the hydroxyl at $\mathrm{C}_{3}$, without other substitutions on the ring may dramatically reduce the potency of the drugs. For example, phenylephrine (Figure 9-4) is much less potent than epinephrine; indeed, a-receptor affinity is decreased about 100-fold and Bactivity is almost negligible except at very high concentrations. However, catecholamines are subject to inactivation by catechol-O- methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme found in gut and liver (see Chapter 6). Therefore, absence of one or both - OH groups on the phenyl ring increases the bioavailability after oral administration and prolongs the duration of action. Furthermore, absence of ring - OH groups tends to increase the distribution of the molecule to the central nervous system. For example, ephedrine and amphetamine (Figure 9-4) are orally active, have a prolonged duration of action, and produce central nervous system effects not typically observed with the catecholamines.

\section*{SUBSTITUTION ON THE ALPHA CARBON}

Substitutions at the acarbon block oxidation by monoamine oxidase (MAO) and prolong the action of such drugs, particularly the noncatecholamines. Ephedrine and amphetamine are examples of as a compounds (Figure 9-4). Alpha-methyl compounds are also called phenylisopropylamines. In addition to their resistance to oxidation by MAO, some phenylisopropylamines have an enhanced ability to displace catecholamines from storage sites in noradrenergic nerves (see Chapter 6). Therefore, a portion of their activity is dependent on the presence of normal norepinephrine stores in the body; they are indirectly acting sympathomimetics.

\section*{SUBSTITUTION ON THE BETA CARBON}

Direct-acting agonists typically have a B-hydroxyl group, though dopamine does not. In addition to facilitating activation of adrenoceptors, this hydroxyl group may be important for storage of sympathomimetic amines in neural vesicles.

\section*{ORGAN SYSTEM EFFECTS OF SYMPATHOMI METI C DRUGS}

General outlines of the cellular actions of sympathomimetics are presented in Tables 6-3 and 9-3. The net effect of a given drug in the intact organism depends on its relative receptor affinity (a. or B), intrinsic activity, and the compensatory reflexes evoked by its direct actions.

\section*{Cardiovascular System}

\section*{BLOOD VESSELS}

Vascular smooth muscle tone is regulated by adrenoceptors; consequently, catecholamines are important in controlling peripheral vascular resistance and venous capacitance. Alpha receptors increase arterial resistance, whereas $B_{2}$ receptors promote smooth muscle relaxation. There are major differences in receptor types in the various vascular beds (Table 9-4). The skin vessels have predominantly areceptors and constrict in response to epinephrine and norepinephrine, as do the splanchnic vessels. Vessels in skeletal muscle may constrict or dilate depending on whether breceptors are activated. Consequently,
the overall effects of a sympathomimetic drug on blood vessels depend on the relative activities of that drug at and Breceptors and the anatomic sites of the vessels affected. In addition, $\mathrm{D}_{1}$ receptors promote vasodilation of renal, splanchnic, coronary, cerebral, and perhaps other resistance vessels. Activation of the $D_{1}$ receptors in the renal vasculature may play a major role in the natriuresis induced by pharmacologic administration of dopamine.

\section*{HEART}

Direct effects on the heart are determined largely by $B_{1}$ receptors, although $B_{2}$ and to a lesser extent $x$. receptors are also involved, especially in heart failure. Beta-receptor activation results in increased calcium influx in cardiac cells. This has both electrical (Figure 9-5) and mechanical consequences. Pacemaker activity, both normal (sinoatrial node) and abnormal (eg, Purkinje fibers), is increased (positive chronotropic effect). Conduction velocity in the atrioventricular node is increased, and the refractory period is decreased. Intrinsic contractility is increased (positive inotropic effect), and relaxation is accelerated. As a result, the twitch response of isolated cardiac muscle is increased in tension but abbreviated in duration. In the intact heart, intraventricular pressure rises and falls more rapidly, and ejection time is decreased. These direct effects are easily demonstrated in the absence of reflexes evoked by changes in blood pressure, eg, in isolated myocardial preparations and in patients with ganglionic blockade. In the presence of normal reflex activity, the direct effects on heart rate may be dominated by a reflex response to blood pressure changes. Physiologic stimulation of the heart by catecholamines tends to increase coronary blood flow.

\section*{BLOOD PRESSURE}

The effects of sympathomimetic drugs on blood pressure can be explained on the basis of their effects on the heart, the peripheral vascular resistance, and the venous return (see Figure 6-7 and Table 9-4). A relatively pure agonist such as phenylephrine increases peripheral arterial resistance and decreases venous capacitance. The enhanced arterial resistance usually leads to a dose-dependent rise in blood pressure (Figure 9-6). In the presence of normal cardiovascular reflexes, the rise in blood pressure elicits a baroreceptor-mediated increase in vagal tone with slowing of the heart rate, which may be quite marked. However, cardiac output may not diminish in proportion to this reduction in rate, since increased venous return may increase stroke volume. Furthermore, direct a-adrenoceptor stimulation of the heart may have a modest positive inotropic action. While these are the expected effects of pure aganists in normal subjects, their use in hypotensive patients usually does not lead to brisk reflex responses because in this situation blood pressure is returning to normal, not exceeding normal.

Effects of an $\alpha$-selective (phenylephrine), $\beta$-selective (isoproterenol), and nonselective (epinephrine) sympathomimetic, given as an intravenous bolus injection to a dog. (BP, blood pressure; HR, heart rate.) Reflexes are blunted but not eliminated in this anesthetized animal.

The blood pressure response to a pure B-adrenoceptor agonist is quite different. Stimulation of Breceptors in the heart increases cardiac output. A relatively pure Bagonist such as isoproterenol also decreases peripheral resistance by activating $B_{2}$ receptors, leading to vasodilation in certain vascular beds (Table 9-4). The net effect is to maintain or slightly increase systolic pressure while permitting a fall in diastolic pressure owing to enhanced diastolic runoff (Figure 9-6). The actions of drugs with both cand Beffects (eg, epinephrine and norepinephrine) are discussed below.

\section*{Eye}

The radial pupillary dilator muscle of the iris contains creceptors; activation by drugs such as phenylephrine causes mydriasis (see Figure 6-9). Alpha stimulants also have important effects on intraocular pressure. Present evidence suggests that agonists increase the outflow of aqueous humor from the eye and reduce intraocular pressure. In contrast, Bagonists have little effect, but Bantagonists decrease the production of aqueous humor. These effects are important in the treatment of glaucoma (see Chapter 10), a leading cause of blindness. Beta stimulants relax the ciliary muscle to a minor degree, causing an insignificant decrease in accommodation. In addition, adrenergic drugs may directly protect neuronal cells in the retina.

\section*{Respiratory Tract}

Bronchial smooth muscle contains $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ receptors that cause relaxation. Activation of these receptors results in bronchodilation (see Chapter 20 and Table 9-3). The blood vessels of the upper respiratory tract mucosa contain areceptors; the decongestant action of adrenoceptor stimulants is clinically useful (see Clinical Pharmacology).

\section*{Gastrointestinal Tract}

Relaxation of gastrointestinal smooth muscle can be brought about by both $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-stimulant agents. Beta receptors appear to be located directly on the smooth muscle cells and mediate relaxation via hyperpolarization and decreased spike activity in these cells. Alpha stimulants, especially $a_{2}$-selective agonists, decrease muscle activity indirectly by presynaptically reducing the release of acetylcholine and possibly other stimulants within the enteric nervous system (see Chapter 6). The a.-receptor-mediated response is probably of greater pharmacologic significance than the B-stimulant response. Alpha ${ }_{2}$ receptors may also decrease salt and water flux into the lumen of the intestine.

\section*{Genitourinary Tract}

The human uterus contains and $B_{2}$ receptors. The fact that the Breceptors mediate relaxation may be clinically useful in pregnancy (see Clinical Pharmacology). The bladder base, urethral sphincter, and prostate contain areceptors that mediate contraction and therefore promote urinary continence. The specific subtype of $\alpha_{1}$ receptor involved in mediating constriction of the bladder base and prostate is uncertain, but $\alpha_{1 \mathrm{~A}}$ receptors probably play an important role. The $\beta_{2}$ receptors of the bladder wall mediate relaxation. Ejaculation depends on normal a.-receptor (and possibly purinergic receptor) activation in the ductus deferens, seminal vesicles, and prostate. The detumescence of erectile tissue that normally follows ejaculation is also brought about by norepinephrine (and possibly neuropeptide Y ) released from sympathetic nerves. Alpha activation appears to have a similar detumescent effect on erectile tissue in female animals.

\section*{Exocrine Glands}

The salivary glands contain adrenoceptors that regulate the secretion of amylase and water. However, certain sympathomimetic drugs, eg, clonidine, produce symptoms of dry mouth. The mechanism of this effect is uncertain; it is likely that central nervous system effects are responsible, though peripheral effects may contribute.

The apocrine sweat glands, located on the palms of the hands and a few other areas, respond to adrenoceptor stimulants with increased sweat production. These are the apocrine nonthermoregulatory glands usually associated with psychologic stress. (The diffusely distributed thermoregulatory eccrine sweat glands are regulated by sympathetic cholinergic postganglionic nerves that activate muscarinic cholinoceptors; see Chapter 6.)

\section*{Metabolic Effects}

Sympathomimetic drugs have important effects on intermediary metabolism. Activation of Badrenoceptors in fat cells leads to increased lipolysis with enhanced release of free fatty acids and glycerol into the blood. Beta $_{3}$ adrenoceptors play a role in mediating this response. There is considerable interest in developing $B_{3}$ -receptor-selective agonists, which could be useful in some metabolic disorders. Human lipocytes also contain $Q_{2}$ receptors that inhibit lipolysis by decreasing intracellular cAMP. Sympathomimetic drugs enhance glycogenolysis in the liver, which leads to increased glucose release into the circulation. In the human liver, the effects of catecholamines are probably mediated mainly by Breceptors, though $\alpha_{1}$ receptors may also play a role. Catecholamines in high concentration may also cause metabolic acidosis. Activation of $B_{2}$
adrenoceptors by endogenous epinephrine or by sympathomimetic drugs promotes the uptake of potassium into cells, leading to a fall in extracellular potassium. This may lead to a fall in the plasma potassium concentration during stress or protect against a rise in plasma potassium during exercise. Blockade of these receptors may accentuate the rise in plasma potassium that occurs during exercise. Beta receptors and $a_{2}$ receptors that are expressed in pancreatic islets tend to increase and decrease, respectively, insulin secretion, although the major regulator of insulin release is the plasma concentration of glucose.

\section*{Effects on Endocrine Function \& Leukocytosis}

Catecholamines are important endogenous regulators of hormone secretion from a number of glands. As mentioned above, insulin secretion is stimulated by Breceptors and inhibited by $\alpha_{2}$ receptors. Similarly, renin secretion is stimulated by $B_{1}$ and inhibited by $\alpha_{2}$ receptors; indeed, $B$-receptor antagonist drugs may lower plasma renin and blood pressure in patients with hypertension at least in part by this mechanism. Adrenoceptors also modulate the secretion of parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, thyroxine, and gastrin; however, the physiologic significance of these control mechanisms is probably limited. In high concentrations, epinephrine and related agents cause leukocytosis, in part by promoting demargination of white blood cells sequestered away from the general circulation.

\section*{Effects on the Central Nervous System}

The action of sympathomimetics on the central nervous system varies dramatically, depending on their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The catecholamines are almost completely excluded by this barrier, and subjective central nervous system effects are noted only at the highest rates of infusion. These effects have been described as ranging from "nervousness" to "a feeling of impending disaster," sensations that are undesirable. Furthermore, peripheral effects of B-adrenoceptor agonists such as tachycardia and tremor are similar to the somatic manifestations of anxiety. In contrast, noncatecholamines with indirect actions, such as amphetamines, which readily enter the central nervous system from the circulation, produce qualitatively very different central nervous system effects. These actions vary from mild alerting, with improved attention to boring tasks; through elevation of mood, insomnia, euphoria, and anorexia; to fullblown psychotic behavior. These effects are not readily assigned to either as or B-mediated actions and may represent enhancement of dopamine-mediated processes or other effects of these drugs in the central nervous system.

\section*{SPECI FIC SYMPATHOMI METI C DRUGS}

\section*{Catecholamines}

Epinephrine (adrenaline) is a very potent vasoconstrictor and cardiac stimulant. The rise in systolic blood pressure that occurs after epinephrine release or administration is caused by its positive inotropic and chronotropic actions on the heart (predominantly $B_{1}$ receptors) and the vasoconstriction induced in many vascular beds (c. receptors). Epinephrine also activates $B_{2}$ receptors in some vessels (eg, skeletal muscle blood vessels), leading to their dilation. Consequently, total peripheral resistance may actually fall, explaining the fall in diastolic pressure that is sometimes seen with epinephrine injection (Figure 9-6; Table 9-4). Activation of these $B_{2}$ receptors in skeletal muscle contributes to increased blood flow during exercise. Under physiologic conditions, epinephrine functions largely as a hormone; after release from the adrenal medulla into the blood, it acts on distant cells.

Norepinephrine (levarterenol, noradrenaline) and epinephrine have similar effects on $B_{1}$ receptors in the
heart and similar potency at creceptors. Norepinephrine has relatively little effect on $B_{2}$ receptors. Consequently, norepinephrine increases peripheral resistance and both diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Compensatory vagal reflexes tend to overcome the direct positive chronotropic effects of norepinephrine; however, the positive inotropic effects on the heart are maintained (Table 9-4).

Isoproterenol (isoprenaline) is a very potent B-receptor agonist and has little effect on areceptors. The drug has positive chronotropic and inotropic actions; because isoproterenol activates Breceptors almost exclusively, it is a potent vasodilator. These actions lead to a marked increase in cardiac output associated with a fall in diastolic and mean arterial pressure and a lesser decrease or a slight increase in systolic pressure (Table 9-4; Figure 9-6).

Dopamine, the immediate metabolic precursor of norepinephrine, activates $D_{1}$ receptors in several vascular beds, which leads to vasodilation. The effect this has on renal blood flow can be of clinical value. The activation of presynaptic $D_{2}$ receptors, which suppress norepinephrine release, contributes to these effects to an unknown extent. In addition, dopamine activates $B_{1}$ receptors in the heart. At low doses, peripheral resistance may decrease. At higher rates of infusion, dopamine activates vascular areceptors, leading to vasoconstriction, including in the renal vascular bed. Consequently, high rates of infusion of dopamine may mimic the actions of epinephrine.

Fenoldopam is a $D_{1}$-receptor agonist that selectively leads to peripheral vasodilation in some vascular beds. The primary indication for fenoldopam is in the intravenous treatment of severe hypertension (Chapter 11). Continuous infusions of the drug have prompt effects on blood pressure.

Dopamine agonists with central actions are of considerable value for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and prolactinemia. These agents are discussed in Chapters 28 and 37.

Dobutamine is a relatively $\beta_{1}$-selective synthetic catecholamine. As discussed below, dobutamine also activates $\alpha_{1}$ receptors.

\section*{Other Sympathomimetics}

These agents are of interest because of pharmacokinetic features (oral activity, distribution to the central nervous system) or because of relative selectivity for specific receptor subclasses.

Phenylephrine was previously described as an example of a relatively pure agonist (Table 9-2). It acts directly on the receptors. Because it is not a catechol derivative (Figure 9-4), it is not inactivated by COMT and has a much longer duration of action than the catecholamines. It is an effective mydriatic and decongestant and can be used to raise the blood pressure (Figure 9-6).

Methoxamine acts pharmacologically like phenylephrine, since it is predominantly a direct-acting $x_{1}$ receptor agonist. It may cause a prolonged increase in blood pressure due to vasoconstriction; it also causes a vagally mediated bradycardia. Methoxamine is available for parenteral use, but clinical applications are rare and limited to hypotensive states.

Midodrine is a prodrug that is enzymatically hydrolyzed to desglymidodrine, an $a_{1}$-receptor-selective agonist. The peak concentration of desglymidodrine is achieved about 1 hour after midodrine is administered. The primary indication for midodrine is the treatment of postural hypotension, typically due to impaired autonomic nervous system function. Although the drug has efficacy in diminishing the fall of blood pressure when the patient is standing, it may cause hypertension when the subject is supine.

Ephedrine occurs in various plants and has been used in China for over 2000 years; it was introduced into Western medicine in 1924 as the first orally active sympathomimetic drug. It is found in ma-huang, a popular herbal medication (see Chapter 65). Ma-huang contains multiple ephedrine-like alkaloids in addition to ephedrine. Because ephedrine is a noncatechol phenylisopropylamine (Figure 9-4), it has high bioavailability and a relatively long duration of action-hours rather than minutes. As is the case with many other phenylisopropylamines, a significant fraction of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Since it is a weak base, its excretion can be accelerated by acidification of the urine.

Ephedrine has not been extensively studied in humans in spite of its long history of use. Its ability to activate Breceptors probably accounted for its earlier use in asthma. Because it gains access to the central nervous system, it is a mild stimulant. Ingestion of ephedrine alkaloids contained in ma-huang has raised important safety concerns. Pseudoephedrine, one of four ephedrine enantiomers, has been available over the counter as a component of many decongestant mixtures. However, the use of pseudoephedrine as a precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine has led to restrictions on its sale.

Xylometazoline and oxymetazoline are direct-acting agonists. These drugs have been used as topical decongestants because of their ability to promote constriction of the nasal mucosa. When taken in large doses, oxymetazoline may cause hypotension, presumably because of a central clonidine-like effect (Chapter 11). Oxymetazoline has significant affinity for $\alpha_{2 \mathrm{~A}}$ receptors.

Amphetamine is a phenylisopropylamine (Figure 9-4) that is important chiefly because of its use and misuse as a central nervous system stimulant (see Chapter 32). Its pharmacokinetics are similar to those of ephedrine; however, amphetamine even more readily enters the central nervous system, where it has marked stimulant effects on mood and alertness and a depressant effect on appetite. Its peripheral actions are mediated primarily through the release of catecholamines. Methamphetamine (Nmethylamphetamine) is very similar to amphetamine with an even higher ratio of central to peripheral actions. Phenmetrazine is a variant phenylisopropylamine with amphetamine-like effects. It has been promoted as an anorexiant and is also a popular drug of abuse. Methylphenidate and pemoline are amphetamine variants whose major pharmacologic effects and abuse potential are similar to those of amphetamine. These two drugs appear to have efficacy in some children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (see Clinical Pharmacology). Pemoline has been withdrawn from use in the USA because of an association with life-threatening hepatic failure. Modafinil is a new drug with both similarities to and differences from amphetamine. It has significant effects on central ${ }_{18}$ receptors but in addition appears to affect GABAergic, glutaminergic, and serotonergic synapses (see Clinical Pharmacology).

\section*{Receptor-Selective Sympathomimetic Drugs}

Alpha $_{2}$-selective agonists have an important ability to decrease blood pressure through actions in the central nervous system even though direct application to a blood vessel may cause vasoconstriction. Such drugs (eg, clonidine, methyldopa, guanfacine, guanabenz) are useful in the treatment of hypertension (and some other conditions) and are discussed in Chapter 11. Dexmedetomidine is a centrally acting $a_{2}$ selective agonist that is indicated for sedation of initially intubated and mechanically ventilated patients during treatment in an intensive care setting.

Beta-selective agonists are very important because of the separation of $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ effects that has been achieved (Table 9-2). Although this separation is incomplete, it is sufficient to reduce adverse effects in several clinical applications.

Beta $_{1}$-selective agents include dobutamine and a partial agonist, prenalterol (Figure 9-7). Because they are less effective in activating vasodilator $B_{2}$ receptors, they may increase cardiac output with less reflex tachycardia than occurs with nonselective Bagonists such as isoproterenol. Dobutamine consists of two isomers, administered as a racemic mixture. The ( + ) isomer is a potent $B_{1}$ agonist and an $\alpha_{1}$ receptor antagonist. The (-) isomer is a potent $a_{1}$ agonist, capable of causing significant vasoconstriction when given alone. This action tends to reduce vasodilation and may also contribute to the positive inotropic action caused by the isomer with predominantly B-receptor activity. A major limitation with these drugs-as with other direct-acting sympathomimetic agents-is that tolerance to their effects may develop with prolonged use and the likelihood that chronic cardiac stimulation in patients with heart failure may worsen long-term outcome.

Beta ${ }_{2}$-selective agents have achieved an important place in the treatment of asthma and are discussed in Chapter 20. An additional application is to achieve uterine relaxation in premature labor (ritodrine; see below). Some examples of $\mathrm{B}_{2}$-selective drugs currently in use are shown in Figures 9-7 and 20-4; many more are available or under investigation.

\section*{Special Sympathomimetics}

Cocaine is a local anesthetic with a peripheral sympathomimetic action that results from inhibition of
transmitter reuptake at noradrenergic synapses (see Chapter 6). It readily enters the central nervous system and produces an amphetamine-like effect that is shorter lasting and more intense. The major action of cocaine in the central nervous system is to inhibit dopamine reuptake into neurons in the "pleasure centers" of the brain. These properties and the fact that it can be smoked, "snorted" into the nose, or injected for rapid onset of effect have made it a heavily abused drug (see Chapter 32). Interestingly, dopamine-transporter knockout mice still self-administer cocaine, suggesting that cocaine may have additional pharmacologic targets.

Tyramine (see Figure 6-5) is a normal by-product of tyrosine metabolism in the body and is also found in high concentrations in some fermented foods such as cheese (Table 9-5). It is readily metabolized by MAO in the liver and is normally inactive when taken orally because of a very high first-pass effect, ie, low bioavailability. If administered parenterally, it has an indirect sympathomimetic action caused by the release of stored catecholamines. Consequently, its spectrum of action is similar to that of norepinephrine. In patients treated with MAO inhibitors-particularly inhibitors of the MAO-A isoform-this effect of tyramine may be greatly intensified, leading to marked increases in blood pressure. This occurs because of increased bioavailability of tyramine and increased neuronal stores of catecholamines. Patients taking MAO inhibitors must be very careful to avoid tyramine-containing foods. There are differences in the effects of various MAO inhibitors on tyramine bioavailability, and isoform-specific or reversible enzyme antagonists may be safer (see Chapters 28 and 30).

Note: In a patient taking an irreversible MAO inhibitor drug, $20-50 \mathrm{mg}$ of tyramine in a meal may increase the blood pressure significantly (see also Chapter 30: Antidepressant Agents). Note that only cheese, sausage, pickled fish, and yeast supplements contain sufficient tyramine to be consistently dangerous. This does not rule out the possibility that some preparations of other foods might contain significantly greater than average amounts of tyramine.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF SYMPATHOMI METI C DRUGS}

The rationale for the use of sympathomimetic drugs in therapy rests on a knowledge of the physiologic effects of catecholamines on tissues. Selection of a particular sympathomimetic drug from the host of compounds available depends upon such factors as whether activation of $\alpha, B_{1}$, or $B_{2}$ receptors is desired; the duration of action desired; and the preferred route of administration. Sympathomimetic drugs are very potent and can have profound effects on a variety of organ systems, particularly the heart and peripheral circulation. Therefore, great caution is indicated when these agents are used parenterally. In most cases, rather than using fixed doses of the drugs, careful monitoring of pharmacologic response is required to determine the appropriate dosage, especially if the drug is being infused. Generally, it is desirable to use the minimum dose required to achieve the desired response. The adverse effects of these drugs are generally understandable in terms of their known physiologic effects.

\section*{Cardiovascular Applications}

\section*{CONDITIONS IN WHICH BLOOD FLOW OR PRESSURE IS TO BE ENHANCED}

Hypotension may occur in a variety of settings such as decreased blood volume, cardiac arrhythmias, neurologic disease or accidents, adverse reactions to medications such as antihypertensive drugs, and infection. If cerebral, renal, cardiac perfusion is maintained, hypotension itself does not usually require vigorous direct treatment. Rather, placing the patient in the recumbent position and ensuring adequate fluid volume, while the primary problem is determined and treated, is usually the correct course of action. The use of sympathomimetic drugs merely to elevate a blood pressure that is not an immediate threat to the patient may increase morbidity (see Toxicity of Sympathomimetic Drugs, below). Sympathomimetic drugs may be used in a hypotensive emergency to preserve cerebral and coronary blood flow. Such situations might arise in severe hemorrhage, spinal cord injury, or overdoses of antihypertensive or central nervous system depressant medications. The treatment is usually of short duration while the appropriate intravenous fluid or blood is being administered. Direct-acting a phenylephrine, or methoxamine have been utilized in this setting if vasoconstriction is desired. For the treatment of chronic orthostatic hypotension, oral ephedrine has been the traditional therapy. Midodrine, an orally active agonist, may be the preferred sympathomimetic in this application if further studies confirm its long-term safety and efficacy.

Shock is a complex acute cardiovascular syndrome that results in a critical reduction in perfusion of vital tissues and a wide range of systemic effects. Shock is usually associated with hypotension, an altered mental state, oliguria, and metabolic acidosis. If untreated, shock usually progresses to a refractory deteriorating state and death. The three major mechanisms responsible for shock are hypovolemia, cardiac insufficiency, and altered vascular resistance. Volume replacement and treatment of the underlying disease are the mainstays of the treatment of shock. Although sympathomimetic drugs have been used in the treatment of virtually all forms of shock, their efficacy is unclear.

In most forms of shock, vasoconstriction mediated by the sympathetic nervous system is already intense. Indeed, efforts aimed at reducing rather than increasing peripheral resistance may be more fruitful if cerebral, coronary, and renal perfusion are improved. A decision to use vasoconstrictors or vasodilators is best made on the basis of information about the underlying cause, which may require invasive monitoring.

Cardiogenic shock, usually due to massive myocardial infarction, has a poor prognosis. Mechanically assisted perfusion and emergency cardiac surgery have been utilized in some settings. Optimal fluid replacement requires monitoring of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and other parameters of cardiac function. Positive inotropic agents such as dopamine or dobutamine may have a role in this situation. In low to moderate doses, these drugs may increase cardiac output and, compared with norepinephrine, cause relatively little peripheral vasoconstriction. Isoproterenol increases heart rate and work more than either dopamine or dobutamine. See Chapter 13 and Table 13-4 for a discussion of shock associated with myocardial infarction.

Unfortunately, the patient with shock may not respond to any of these therapeutic maneuvers; the temptation is then great to use vasoconstrictors to maintain adequate blood pressure. Coronary perfusion may be improved, but this gain may be offset by increased myocardial oxygen demands as well as more severe vasoconstriction in blood vessels to the abdominal viscera. Therefore, the goal of therapy in shock should be to optimize tissue perfusion, not blood pressure.

\section*{CONDITIONS IN WHI CH BLOOD FLOW IS TO BE REDUCED}

Reduction of local or regional blood flow is desirable for achieving hemostasis in surgery, for reducing diffusion of local anesthetics away from the site of administration, and for reducing mucous membrane congestion. In each instance, a-receptor activation is desired, and the choice of agent depends upon the maximal efficacy required, the desired duration of action, and the route of administration.

Effective pharmacologic hemostasis, often necessary for facial, oral, and nasopharyngeal surgery, requires drugs of high efficacy that can be administered in high concentration by local application. Epinephrine is usually applied topically in nasal packs (for epistaxis) or in a gingival string (for gingivectomy). Cocaine is still sometimes used for nasopharyngeal surgery, because it combines a hemostatic effect with local anesthesia. Occasionally, cocaine is mixed with epinephrine for maximum hemostasis and local anesthesia.

Combining a cagonists with some local anesthetics greatly prolongs the duration of infiltration nerve block; the total dose of local anesthetic (and the probability of toxicity) can therefore be reduced. Epinephrine, 1:200,000, is the favored agent for this application, but norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and other a. agonists have also been used. Systemic effects on the heart and peripheral vasculature may occur even with local drug administration.

Mucous membrane decongestants are aganists that reduce the discomfort of hay fever and, to a lesser
extent, the common cold by decreasing the volume of the nasal mucosa. These effects are probably mediated by $x_{1}$ receptors. Unfortunately, rebound hyperemia may follow the use of these agents, and repeated topical use of high drug concentrations may result in ischemic changes in the mucous membranes, probably as a result of vasoconstriction of nutrient arteries. Constriction of these vessels may involve activation of $c_{2}$ receptors. For example, phenylephrine is often used in nasal decongestant sprays. A longer duration of action-at the cost of much lower local concentrations and greater potential for cardiac and central nervous system effects-can be achieved by the oral administration of agents such as ephedrine or one of its isomers, pseudoephedrine. Long-acting topical decongestants include xylometazoline and oxymetazoline. Most of these mucous membrane decongestants are available as over-the-counter products.

\section*{CARDIAC APPLICATIONS}

Catecholamines such as isoproterenol and epinephrine have been used in the temporary emergency management of complete heart block and cardiac arrest. Epinephrine may be useful in cardiac arrest in part by redistributing blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation to coronaries and to the brain. However, electronic pacemakers are both safer and more effective in heart block and should be inserted as soon as possible if there is any indication of continued high-degree block.

Heart failure may respond to the positive inotropic effects of drugs such as dobutamine. These applications are discussed in Chapter 13. The development of tolerance or desensitization is a major limitation to the use of catecholamines in heart failure.

\section*{Pulmonary Applications}

One of the most important uses of sympathomimetic drugs is in the therapy of bronchial asthma. This use is discussed in Chapter 20. Nonselective drugs (epinephrine), $B$-selective agents (isoproterenol), and $B_{2}$ selective agents (metaproterenol, terbutaline, albuterol) are all available for this indication.
Sympathomimetics other than the $B_{2}$-selective drugs are now rarely used because they are likely to have more adverse effects than the selective drugs.

\section*{Anaphylaxis}

Anaphylactic shock and related immediate (type I) IgE-mediated reactions affect both the respiratory and the cardiovascular systems. The syndrome of bronchospasm, mucous membrane congestion, angioedema, and severe hypotension usually responds rapidly to the parenteral administration of epinephrine, 0.3-0.5 mg ( $0.3-0.5 \mathrm{~mL}$ of $1: 1000$ epinephrine solution). Intramuscular injection may be the preferred route of administration, since skin blood flow (and hence systemic drug absorption from subcutaneous injection) is unpredictable in hypotensive patients. In some patients with impaired cardiovascular function, intravenous injection of epinephrine may be required. Extensive experimental and clinical experience with the drug in anaphylaxis supports epinephrine as the agent of choice, presumably because epinephrine activates $\alpha_{1}, \beta_{1}$, and $B_{2}$ receptors, all of which may be important in reversing the pathophysiologic processes underlying anaphylaxis. Glucocorticoids and antihistamines (both $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ - and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-receptor antagonists) may be useful as secondary therapy in anaphylaxis; however, epinephrine is the initial treatment.

\section*{Ophthalmic Applications}

Phenylephrine is an effective mydriatic agent frequently used to facilitate examination of the retina. It is also a useful decongestant for minor allergic hyperemia and itching of the conjunctival membranes. Sympathomimetics administered as ophthalmic drops are also useful in localizing the lesion in Horner's
syndrome. (See An Application of Basic Pharmacology to a Clinical Problem.)
Glaucoma responds to a variety of sympathomimetic and sympathoplegic drugs. (See Chapter 10: The Treatment of Glaucoma.) Epinephrine and its prodrug dipivefrin are now rarely used, but B-blocking agents are among the most important therapies. Apraclonidine and brimonidine are $\alpha_{2}$-selective agonists that also lower intraocular pressure and are approved for use in glaucoma. The mechanism of action of these drugs in treating glaucoma is still uncertain; direct neuroprotective effects may be involved in addition to the benefits of lowering intraocular pressure.

\section*{AN APPLI CATION OF BASIC PHARMACOLOGY TO A CLI NICAL PROBLEM}

Horner's syndrome is a condition-usually unilateral-that results from interruption of the sympathetic nerves to the face. The effects include vasodilation, ptosis, miosis, and loss of sweating on the side affected. The syndrome can be caused by either a preganglionic or a postganglionic lesion, such as a tumor. Knowledge of the location of the lesion (preganglionic or postganglionic) helps determine the optimal therapy.

An understanding of the effects of denervation on neurotransmitter metabolism permits the clinician to use drugs to localize the lesion. In most situations, a localized lesion in a nerve causes degeneration of the distal portion of that fiber and loss of transmitter contents from the degenerated nerve ending-without affecting neurons innervated by the fiber. Therefore, a preganglionic lesion leaves the postganglionic adrenergic neuron intact, whereas a postganglionic lesion results in degeneration of the adrenergic nerve endings and loss of stored catecholamines from them. Because indirectly acting sympathomimetics require normal stores of catecholamines, such drugs can be used to test for the presence of normal adrenergic nerve endings. The iris, because it is easily visible and responsive to topical sympathomimetics, is a convenient assay tissue in the patient.

If the lesion of Horner's syndrome is postganglionic, indirectly acting sympathomimetics (eg, cocaine, hydroxyamphetamine) will not dilate the abnormally constricted pupil because catecholamines have been lost from the nerve endings in the iris. In contrast, the pupil dilates in response to phenylephrine, which acts directly on the areceptors on the smooth muscle of the iris. A patient with a preganglionic lesion, on the other hand, shows a normal response to both drugs, since the postganglionic fibers and their catecholamine stores remain intact in this situation.

\section*{Genitourinary Applications}

As noted above, $B_{2}$-selective agents relax the pregnant uterus. Ritodrine, terbutaline, and similar drugs have been used to suppress premature labor. The goal is to defer labor long enough to ensure adequate maturation of the fetus. These drugs may delay labor for several days. This may afford time to administer corticosteroid drugs, which decrease the incidence of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. However, meta-analysis of older trials and a randomized study suggest that $B$-agonist therapy may have no significant benefit on perinatal infant mortality and may increase maternal morbidity.

Oral sympathomimetic therapy is occasionally useful in the treatment of stress incontinence. Ephedrine or pseudoephedrine may be tried.

\section*{Central Nervous System Applications}

The amphetamines have a mood-elevating (euphoriant) effect; this effect is the basis for the widespread abuse of this drug and some of its analogs (see Chapter 32). The amphetamines also have an alerting, sleep-deferring action that is manifested by improved attention to repetitive tasks and by acceleration and desynchronization of the electroencephalogram. A therapeutic application of this effect is in the treatment of narcolepsy. Modafinil, a new amphetamine substitute, is approved for use in narcolepsy and is claimed to have fewer disadvantages (excessive mood changes, insomnia, abuse potential) than amphetamine in this condition. The appetite-suppressing effect of these agents is easily demonstrated in experimental animals. In obese humans, an encouraging initial response may be observed, but there is no evidence that long-term improvement in weight control can be achieved with amphetamines alone, especially when administered for a relatively short course. A final application of the CNS-active sympathomimetics is in the attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) of children, a poorly defined and overdiagnosed behavioral syndrome consisting of short attention span, hyperkinetic physical behavior, and learning problems. Some patients with this syndrome respond well to low doses of methylphenidate and related agents or to clonidine. Extended-release formulations of methylphenidate may simplify dosing regimens and increase adherence to therapy, especially in school-age children. Evidence from several clinical trials suggests that modafinil may also be useful in ADHD.

\section*{Additional Therapeutic Uses}

Although the primary use of the $a_{2}$ agonist clonidine is in the treatment of hypertension (Chapter 11), the drug has been found to have efficacy in the treatment of diarrhea in diabetics with autonomic neuropathy, perhaps because of its ability to enhance salt and water absorption from the intestines. In addition, clonidine has efficacy in diminishing craving for narcotics and alcohol during withdrawal and may facilitate cessation of cigarette smoking. Clonidine has also been used to diminish menopausal hot flushes and is being used experimentally to reduce hemodynamic instability during general anesthesia.
Dexmedetomidine is indicated for sedation under intensive care circumstances.

\section*{TOXI CITY OF SYMPATHOMI METI C DRUGS}

The adverse effects of adrenoceptor agonists are primarily extensions of their pharmacologic effects in the cardiovascular and central nervous systems.

Adverse cardiovascular effects seen with intravenously infused pressor agents include marked elevations in blood pressure that cause increased cardiac work, which may precipitate cardiac ischemia and failure. Systemically administered B-receptor-stimulant drugs may cause sinus tachycardia and may even provoke serious ventricular arrhythmias. Sympathomimetic drugs may lead to myocardial damage, particularly after prolonged infusion. Special caution is indicated in elderly patients and those with hypertension or coronary artery disease. To avoid excessive pharmacologic responses, it is essential to monitor the blood pressure when administering sympathomimetic drugs parenterally.

If an adverse sympathomimetic effect requires urgent reversal, a specific adrenoceptor antagonist can be used (see Chapter 10).

Central nervous system toxicity is rarely observed with catecholamines or drugs such as phenylephrine. In moderate doses, amphetamines commonly cause restlessness, tremor, insomnia, and anxiety; in high doses, a paranoid state may be induced. Cocaine may precipitate convulsions, cerebral hemorrhage, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction. Therapy is discussed in Chapter 59.

\section*{ADRENOCEPTOR ANTAGONI ST DRUGS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Since catecholamines play a role in a variety of physiologic and pathophysiologic responses, drugs that block adrenoceptors have important effects, some of which are of great clinical value. These effects vary dramatically according to the drug's selectivity for and Breceptors. The classification of adrenoceptors into $\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}$, and $B$ subtypes and the effects of activating these receptors are discussed in Chapters 6 and 9. Blockade of periphera dopamine receptors is of no recognized clinical importance at present. In contrast, blockade of central nervous system dopamine receptors is very important; drugs that act on these receptors are discussed in Chapters 21 and 29. This chapter deals with pharmacologic antagonist drugs whose major effect is to occupy either $\bar{\alpha}_{1}, \alpha_{2}$, or Breceptors outside the central nervous system and prevent their activation by catecholamines and related agonists.

For pharmacologic research, $\alpha_{1}$ - and $\alpha_{2}$-adrenoceptor antagonist drugs have been very useful in the experimental exploration of autonomic nervous system function. In clinical therapeutics, nonselective $a$. antagonists are used in the treatment of pheochromocytoma (tumors that secrete catecholamines), and $\alpha_{1}$ selective antagonists are used in primary hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Beta-receptor antagonist drugs have been found useful in a much wider variety of clinical conditions and are firmly establishec in the treatment of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, endocrinologic and neurologic disorders, glaucoma, and other conditions.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF THE ALPHA-RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST DRUGS}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Alpha-receptor antagonists may be reversible or irreversible in their interaction with these receptors. Reversible antagonists dissociate from receptors and the block can be surmounted with sufficiently high concentrations of agonists; irreversible drugs do not dissociate and cannot be surmounted. Phentolamine (Figure 10-1) and prazosin are examples of reversible antagonists. Prazosin (and analogs) and labetalol-drugs used primarily for their antihypertensive effects-as well as several ergot derivatives (see Chapter 16) are also reversible a.adrenoceptor antagonists or partial agonists. Phenoxybenzamine, an agent related to the nitrogen mustards, forms a reactive ethyleneimonium intermediate (Figure 10-1) that covalently binds to a receptors, resulting in irreversible blockade. Figure 10-2 illustrates the effects of a reversible drug in comparison with those of an irreversible agent.

Dose-response curves to norepinephrine in the presence of two different a produced in isolated strips of cat spleen, a tissue rich in areceptors, was measured in response to graded doses of norepinephrine. Left: Tolazoline, a reversible blocker, shifted the curve to the right without decreasing the maximum response when present at concentrations of 10 and $20 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$. Right: Dibenamine, an analog of phenoxybenzamine and irreversible in its action, reduced the maximum response attainable at both concentrations tested. (Modified and reproduced with permission, from Bickerton RK: The response of isolated strips of cat spleen to sympathomimetic drugs and their antagonists. J Pharmacol Exp Ther 1963; 142:99.)

As discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, the duration of action of a reversible antagonist is largely dependent on the half-life of the drug in the body and the rate at which it dissociates from its receptor: The shorter the half-life of the drug in the body, the less time it takes for the effects of the drug to dissipate. In contrast, the effects of an irreversible antagonist may persist long after the drug has been cleared from the plasma. In the case of phenoxybenzamine, the restoration of tissue responsiveness after extensive a-receptor blockade is dependent on synthesis of new receptors, which may take several days. The rate of return of $\alpha_{1}$-adrenoceptor responsiveness may be particularly important in patients having a sudden cardiovascular event or who become candidates for urgent surgery.

\section*{Pharmacologic Effects}

\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS}

Because arteriolar and venous tone are determined to a large extent by creceptors on vascular smooth muscle, a-receptor antagonist drugs cause a lowering of peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure (Figure 10-3). These drugs can prevent the pressor effects of usual doses of cagonists; indeed, in the case of agonists with both and $B_{2}$ effects (eg, epinephrine), selective a-receptor antagonism may convert a pressor to a depressor response (Figure 10-3). This change in response is called epinephrine reversal; it illustrates how the activation of both cand Breceptors in the vasculature may lead to opposite responses. Alpha-receptor antagonists often cause postural hypotension and reflex tachycardia; nonselective ( $a_{1}=a_{2}$, Table 10-1)
blockers usually cause significant tachycardia if blood pressure is lowered below normal. Postural hypotension is due to antagonism of sympathetic nervous system stimulation of $a_{1}$ receptors in venous smooth muscle; contraction of veins is an important component of the normal capacity to maintain blood pressure in the upright position since it decreases venous pooling in the periphery. Constriction of arterioles in the legs may also contribute to the postural response. Tachycardia may be more marked with agents that block $a_{2}$-presynaptic receptors in the heart, since the augmented release of norepinephrine will further stimulate Breceptors in the heart.

\section*{OTHER EFFECTS}

Minor effects that signal the blockade of areceptors in other tissues include miosis and nasal stuffiness. Alpha ${ }_{1}$. receptor blockade of the base of the bladder and the prostate is associated with decreased resistance to the flow of urine. Individual agents may have other important effects in addition to a below).

\section*{SPECI FIC AGENTS}

Phentolamine, an imidazoline derivative, is a potent competitive antagonist at both $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$ receptors (Table 10-1). Phentolamine causes a reduction in peripheral resistance through blockade of $a_{1}$ receptors and possibly $Q_{2}$ receptors on vascular smooth muscle. The cardiac stimulation induced by phentolamine is due to sympatheti
stimulation of the heart resulting from baroreflex mechanisms. Furthermore, since phentolamine potently block $\alpha_{2}$ receptors, antagonism of presynaptic $\alpha_{2}$ receptors may lead to enhanced release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves. In addition to being an $\alpha_{1}$ - and $\alpha_{2}$-receptor antagonist, phentolamine also has minor inhibitory effects at serotonin receptors and agonist effects at muscarinic and $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ histamine receptors.

Phentolamine has limited absorption after oral administration. Its pharmacokinetic properties are not well known; it may reach peak concentrations within an hour after oral administration and has a half-life of 5-7 hours. The principal adverse effects are related to cardiac stimulation, which may cause severe tachycardia, arrhythmias, and myocardial ischemia, especially after intravenous administration. With oral administration, adverse effects include tachycardia, nasal congestion, and headache.

Phentolamine has been used in the treatment of pheochromocytoma-especially intraoperatively-as well as for male erectile dysfunction by injection intracavernosally and when taken orally (see below).

Phenoxybenzamine binds covalently to areceptors, causing irreversible blockade of long duration (14-48 hours or longer). It is somewhat selective for $a_{1}$ receptors but less so than prazosin (Table 10-1). The drug als( inhibits reuptake of released norepinephrine by presynaptic adrenergic nerve terminals. Phenoxybenzamine blocks histamine ( $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ ), acetylcholine, and serotonin receptors as well as areceptors (see Chapter 16).

The pharmacologic actions of phenoxybenzamine are primarily related to antagonism of a-receptor-mediated events. Most significant is that phenoxybenzamine attenuates catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction. While phenoxybenzamine causes relatively little fall in blood pressure in normal supine individuals, it reduces blood pressure when sympathetic tone is high, eg, as a result of upright posture or because of reduced blood volume. Cardiac output may be increased because of reflex effects and because of some blockade of presynaptic $\alpha_{2}$ receptors in cardiac sympathetic nerves.

Phenoxybenzamine is absorbed after oral administration, although bioavailability is low and its kinetic propertie are not well known. The drug is usually given orally, starting with low doses of $10-20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ and progressively increasing the dose until the desired effect is achieved. A dosage of less than $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ is usually sufficient to achieve adequate are receptor blockade. The major use of phenoxybenzamine is in the treatment of pheochromocytoma (see below).

Many of the adverse effects of phenoxybenzamine derive from its a-receptor-blocking action; the most important are postural hypotension and tachycardia. Nasal stuffiness and inhibition of ejaculation also occur. Since phenoxybenzamine enters the central nervous system, it may cause less specific effects, including fatigue sedation, and nausea. Because phenoxybenzamine is an alkylating agent, it may have other adverse effects tha have not yet been characterized. Phenoxybenzamine causes tumors in animals, but the clinical implications of this observation are unknown.

Tolazoline is an obsolete agent similar to phentolamine. Ergot derivatives, eg, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, cause reversible a.receptor blockade, probably via a partial agonist action (Chapter 16).

Prazosin is a piperazinyl quinazoline effective in the management of hypertension (see Chapter 11). It is highl! selective for $\alpha_{1}$ receptors and typically 1000-fold less potent at $\alpha_{2}$ receptors. This may partially explain the relative absence of tachycardia seen with prazosin compared with that reported with phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine. Prazosin leads to relaxation of both arterial and venous vascular smooth muscle, as well as smooth muscle in the prostate, due to blockade of $x_{1}$ receptors. Prazosin is extensively metabolized in humans; because of metabolic degradation by the liver, only about $50 \%$ of the drug is available after oral administration.

The half-life is normally about 3 hours.
Terazosin is another reversible $Q_{1}$-selective antagonist that is effective in hypertension (Chapter 11); it is also approved for use in men with urinary symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Terazosin has high bioavailability but is extensively metabolized in the liver, with only a small fraction of unchanged drug excreted in the urine. The half-life of terazosin is 9-12 hours.

Doxazosin is efficacious in the treatment of hypertension and BPH. It differs from prazosin and terazosin in having a longer half-life of about 22 hours. It has moderate bioavailability and is extensively metabolized, with very little parent drug excreted in urine or feces. Doxazosin has active metabolites, although their contribution to the drug's effects is probably small.

Tamsulosin is a competitive $\alpha_{1}$ antagonist with a structure quite different from that of most other $\alpha_{1}$-receptor blockers. It has high bioavailability and a long half-life of $9-15$ hours. It is metabolized extensively in the liver. Tamsulosin has higher affinity for $Q_{1 \mathrm{~A}}$ and receptors than for the subtype. Evidence suggests that tamsulosin has relatively greater potency in inhibiting contraction in prostate smooth muscle versus vascular smooth muscle compared with other -selective antagonists. The drug's efficacy in BPH suggests that the 1 A subtype may be the most important asubtype mediating prostate smooth muscle contraction. Furthermore, compared with other antagonists, tamsulosin has less effect on standing blood pressure in patients.
Nevertheless, caution is appropriate in using any antagonist in patients with diminished sympathetic nervous system function.

\section*{OTHER ALPHA-ADRENOCEPTOR ANTAGONISTS}

Alfuzosin is an $a_{1}$-selective quinazoline derivative that is approved for use in BPH. It has a bioavailability of about $60 \%$, is extensively metabolized, and has an elimination half-life of about 5 hours. Indoramin is another $Q_{1}$-selective antagonist that also has efficacy as an antihypertensive. Urapidil is an $Q_{1}$ antagonist (its primary effect) that also has weak $\alpha_{2}$-agonist and $5-\mathrm{HT}_{1 \mathrm{~A}}$-agonist actions and weak antagonist action at $B_{1}$ receptors. It is used in Europe as an antihypertensive agent and for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Labetalol has both $\alpha_{1}$ selective and $B$-antagonistic effects; it is discussed below. Neuroleptic drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol are potent dopamine receptor antagonists but are also antagonists at areceptors. Their antagonism of areceptors probably contributes to some of their adverse effects, particularly hypotension. Similarly, the antidepressant trazodone has the capacity to block $\alpha_{1}$ receptors.

Yohimbine, an indole alkaloid, is an $a_{2}$-selective antagonist. It has no established clinical role. Theoretically, i could be useful in autonomic insufficiency by promoting neurotransmitter release through blockade of presynaptic $a_{2}$ receptors. It has been suggested that yohimbine improves male sexual function; however, evidence for this effect in humans is limited. Yohimbine can abruptly reverse the antihypertensive effects of an 2 -adrenoceptor agonist such as clonidine-a potentially serious adverse drug interaction.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF THE ALPHA-RECEPTOR- BLOCKI NG DRUGS}

\section*{Pheochromocytoma}

The major clinical use of both phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine is in the management of pheochromocytoma. This tumor is usually found in the adrenal medulla; it typically releases a mixture of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Patients have many symptoms and signs of catecholamine excess, including
intermittent or sustained hypertension, headaches, palpitations, and increased sweating.
The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is usually made on the basis of chemical assay of circulating catecholamines and urinary excretion of catecholamine metabolites, especially 3 -hydroxy- 4 -methoxymandelic acid, metanephrine, and normetanephrine (see Chapter 6). Measurement of plasma metanephrines is also an effective diagnostic tool. A variety of diagnostic techniques are available to localize a pheochromocytoma diagnosed biochemically, including CT and MRI scans as well as scanning with various radioisotopes.

Unavoidable release of stored catecholamines sometimes occurs during operative manipulation of pheochromocytoma; the resulting hypertension may be controlled with phentolamine or nitroprusside. Nitroprusside has many advantages, particularly since its effects can be more readily titrated and it has a shorter duration of action.

Alpha-receptor antagonists are most useful in the preoperative management of patients with pheochromocytoma (Figure 10-4). Administration of phenoxybenzamine in the preoperative period will help control hypertension and will tend to reverse chronic changes resulting from excessive catecholamine secretion such as plasma volume contraction, if present. Furthermore, the patient's operative course may be simplified. Oral doses of $10-20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ can be increased at intervals of several days until hypertension is controlled. Some physicians give phenoxybenzamine to patients with pheochromocytoma for 1-3 weeks before surgery. Other surgeons prefer to operate on patients in the absence of treatment with phenoxybenzamine, counting on modern anesthetic techniques to control blood pressure and heart rate during surgery. Phenoxybenzamine can be very useful in the chronic treatment of inoperable or metastatic pheochromocytoma. Although there is less experience with alternative drugs, hypertension in patients with pheochromocytoma may also respond to reversible $\alpha_{1}$-selective antagonists or to conventional calcium channel antagonists. Beta-receptor antagonists may be required after a-receptor blockade has been instituted to reverse the cardiac effects of excessive catecholamines. Beta antagonists should not be used prior to establishing effective are-receptor blockade, since unopposed B-receptor blockade could theoretically cause blood pressure elevation from increased vasoconstriction.

Effects of phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline) on blood pressure in a patient with pheochromocytoma. Dosage of the drug was begun in the third week as shown by the shaded bar. Supine systolic and diastolic pressures are indicated by the circles, the standing pressures by triangles and the hatched area. Note that the a.-blocking drug dramatically reduced blood pressure. The reduction in orthostatic hypotension, which was marked before treatment, is probably due to normalization of blood volume, a variable that is sometimes markedly reduced in patients with long-standing pheochromocytoma-induced hypertension. (Redrawn and reproduced, with permission, from Engelman E, Sjoerdsma A: Chronic medical therapy for pheochromocytoma. Ann Intern Med 1961;61:229.)

Pheochromocytoma is rarely treated with metyrosine (a-methyltyrosine), the a.-methyl analog of tyrosine. This agent is a competitive inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase and interferes with synthesis of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine (see Figure 6-5). Metyrosine is especially useful in symptomatic patients with inoperable or metastatic pheochromocytoma.

\section*{Hypertensive Emergencies}

The a-adrenoceptor antagonist drugs have limited application in the management of hypertensive emergencies although labetalol has been used in this setting (see Chapter 11). In theory, as-adrenoceptor antagonists are most useful when increased blood pressure reflects excess circulating concentrations of cagonists, eg, in pheochromocytoma, overdosage of sympathomimetic drugs, or clonidine withdrawal. However, other drugs are generally preferable, since considerable experience is necessary to use phentolamine safely in these settings
and few physicians have such experience.

\section*{Chronic Hypertension}

Members of the prazosin family of $a_{1}$-selective antagonists are efficacious drugs in the treatment of mild to moderate systemic hypertension (see Chapter 11). They are generally well tolerated by most patients. Howeve their efficacy in preventing heart failure when used as monotherapy for hypertension has been questioned in th ALLHAT study. Their major adverse effect is postural hypotension, which may be severe after the first doses bu is otherwise uncommon. Nonselective cantagonists are not used in primary systemic hypertension. Prazosin an related drugs may also be associated with feelings of dizziness. This symptom may not be due to a fall in blood pressure, but postural changes in blood pressure should be checked routinely in any patient being treated for hypertension.

It is interesting that the use of a-adrenoceptor antagonists such as prazosin has been found to be associated with either no changes in plasma lipids or increased concentrations of high-density lipoproteins (HDL), which could be a favorable alteration. The mechanism for this effect is not known.

\section*{Peripheral Vascular Disease}

Although a-receptor-blocking drugs have been tried in the treatment of peripheral vascular occlusive disease, there is no evidence that the effects are significant when morphologic changes limit flow in the vessels. Occasionally, individuals with Raynaud's phenomenon and other conditions involving excessive reversible vasospasm in the peripheral circulation do benefit from phentolamine, prazosin, or phenoxybenzamine, althoug calcium channel blockers may be preferable for many patients.

\section*{Local Vasoconstrictor Excess}

Phentolamine has been used to reverse the intense local vasoconstriction caused by inadvertent infiltration of $\alpha$ agonists (eg, norepinephrine) into subcutaneous tissue during intended intravenous administration. The a. antagonist is administered by local infiltration into the ischemic tissue.

\section*{Urinary Obstruction}

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a prevalent disorder in elderly men. A variety of surgical treatments are effectivt in relieving the urinary symptoms of BPH; however, drug therapy is efficacious in many patients. The mechanism of action in improving urine flow involves partial reversal of smooth muscle contraction in the enlarged prostate and in the bladder base. It has been suggested that some $\alpha_{1}$-receptor antagonists may have additional effects on cells in the prostate that help improve symptoms.

A number of well-controlled studies have demonstrated reproducible efficacy of several $a_{1}$-receptor antagonist in patients with BPH. Prazosin, doxazosin, and terazosin are efficacious. These drugs are particularly useful in patients who also have hypertension. Considerable interest has focused on which $a_{1}$-receptor subtype is most important for smooth muscle contraction in the prostate: subtype-selective $Q_{1 \mathrm{~A}}$-receptor antagonists might lea to improved efficacy and safety in treating this disease. As indicated above, tamsulosin is also efficacious in BPt and has little if any effect on blood pressure at a low dose. This drug may be preferred in patients who have experienced postural hypotension with other $Q_{1}$-receptor antagonists.

\section*{Erectile Dysfunction}

A combination of phentolamine with the nonspecific smooth muscle relaxant papaverine, when injected directly into the penis, may cause erections in men with sexual dysfunction. Fibrotic reactions may occur, especially wit
long-term administration. Systemic absorption may lead to orthostatic hypotension; priapism may require direc treatment with an a-adrenoceptor agonist such as phenylephrine. Alternative therapies include prostaglandins (see Chapter 18), sildenafil and other cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors (see Chapter 12), and apomorphine.

\section*{Applications of Alphaz Antagonists}

Alpha ${ }_{2}$ antagonists have relatively little clinical usefulness. There has been experimental interest in the development of highly selective antagonists for use in Raynaud's phenomenon to inhibit smooth muscle contraction, for treatment of type 2 diabetes ( $a_{2}$ receptors inhibit insulin secretion), and for treatment of psychiatric depression. It is not known to what extent the recognition of multiple subtypes of $a_{2}$ receptors will lead to development of clinically useful subtype-selective new drugs.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF THE BETA-RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST DRUGS}

Beta-receptor antagonists share the common feature of antagonizing the effects of catecholamines at $B$ adrenoceptors. Beta-blocking drugs occupy Breceptors and competitively reduce receptor occupancy by catecholamines and other Bagonists. (A few members of this group, used only for experimental purposes, bind irreversibly to Breceptors.) Most B-blocking drugs in clinical use are pure antagonists; that is, the occupancy of a Breceptor by such a drug causes no activation of the receptor. However, some are partial agonists; that is, they cause partial activation of the receptor, albeit less than that caused by the full agonists epinephrine and isoproterenol. As described in Chapter 2, partial agonists inhibit the activation of Breceptors in the presence of high catecholamine concentrations but moderately activate the receptors in the absence of endogenous agonists. Finally, evidence suggests that some Bblockers (eg, betaxolol, metoprolol) are inverse agonistsdrugs that reduce constitutive activity of Breceptors-in some tissues. The clinical significance of this property is not known.

Another major difference among the many $B$-receptor-blocking drugs concerns their relative affinities for $B_{1}$ anc $B_{2}$ receptors (Table 10-1). Some of these antagonists have a higher affinity for $B_{1}$ than for $B_{2}$ receptors, and this selectivity may have important clinical implications. Since none of the clinically available $B$-receptor antagonists are absolutely specific for $B_{1}$ receptors, the selectivity is dose-related; it tends to diminish at higher drug concentrations. Other major differences among Bantagonists relate to their pharmacokinetic characteristic and local anesthetic membrane-stabilizing effects.

Chemically, the $B$-receptor-antagonist drugs (Figure 10-5) resemble isoproterenol (see Figure 9-3), a potent $B$. receptor agonist.

\section*{Pharmacokinetic Properties of the Beta-Receptor Antagonists}

\section*{ABSORPTION}

Most of the drugs in this class are well absorbed after oral administration; peak concentrations occur 1-3 hours after ingestion. Sustained-release preparations of propranolol and metoprolol are available.

\section*{BI OAVAI LABI LI TY}

Propranolol undergoes extensive hepatic (first-pass) metabolism; its bioavailability is relatively low (Table 10-2). The proportion of drug reaching the systemic circulation increases as the dose is increased, suggesting that hepatic extraction mechanisms may become saturated. A major consequence of the low bioavailability of propranolol is that oral administration of the drug leads to much lower drug concentrations than are achieved after intravenous injection of the same dose. Because the first-pass effect varies among individuals, there is great individual variability in the plasma concentrations achieved after oral propranolol. For the same reason, bioavailability is limited to varying degrees for most Bantagonists with the exception of betaxolol, penbutolol, pindolol, and sotalol.

\section*{DISTRIBUTION AND CLEARANCE}

The Bantagonists are rapidly distributed and have large volumes of distribution. Propranolol and penbutolol are quite lipophilic and readily cross the blood-brain barrier (Table 10-2). Most Bantagonists have half-lives in the range of 3-10 hours. A major exception is esmolol, which is rapidly hydrolyzed and has a half-life of approximately 10 minutes. Propranolol and metoprolol are extensively metabolized in the liver, with little unchanged drug appearing in the urine. The cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) genotype is a major determinant of interindividual differences in metoprolol plasma clearance (see Chapter 4). Poor metabolizers exhibit threefol to tenfold higher plasma concentrations after administration of metoprolol than extensive metabolizers. Atenolol, celiprolol, and pindolol are less completely metabolized. Nadolol is excreted unchanged in the urine and has the longest half-life of any available Bantagonist (up to 24 hours). The half-life of nadolol is prolonged i renal failure. The elimination of drugs such as propranolol may be prolonged in the presence of liver disease, diminished hepatic blood flow, or hepatic enzyme inhibition. It is notable that the pharmacodynamic effects of these drugs are often prolonged well beyond the time predicted from half-life data.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics of the Beta-Receptor-Antagonist Drugs}

Most of the effects of these drugs are due to occupancy and blockade of Breceptors. However, some actions may be due to other effects, including partial agonist activity at Breceptors and local anesthetic action, which differ among the Bblockers (Table 10-2).

\section*{EFFECTS ON THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM}

Beta-blocking drugs given chronically lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension (see Chapter 11). The mechanisms involved are not fully understood but probably include effects on the heart and blood vessels, suppression of the renin-angiotensin system, and perhaps effects in the central nervous system or elsewhere. I contrast, conventional doses of these drugs do not usually cause hypotension in healthy individuals with norma blood pressure.

Beta-receptor antagonists have prominent effects on the heart (Figure 10-6) and are very valuable in the treatment of angina (see Chapter 12) and chronic heart failure (see Chapter 13) and following myocardial infarction (see Chapter 14). The negative inotropic and chronotropic effects are predictable from the role of adrenoceptors in regulating these functions. Slowed atrioventricular conduction with an increased PR interval is a related result of adrenoceptor blockade in the atrioventricular node. In the vascular system, $B$-receptor blockade opposes $B_{2}$-mediated vasodilation. This may acutely lead to a rise in peripheral resistance from
unopposed a-receptor-mediated effects as the sympathetic nervous system discharges in response to lowered blood pressure due to the fall in cardiac output. Nonselective and $B_{1}$-blocking drugs antagonize the release of renin caused by the sympathetic nervous system.
Figure 10-6.

The effect in an anesthetized dog of the injection of epinephrine before and after propranolol. In the presence of a B-receptor-blocking agent, epinephrine no longer augments the force of contraction (measured by a strain gauge attached to the ventricular wall) nor increases cardiac rate. Blood pressure is still elevated by epinephrine because vasoconstriction is nc blocked. (Reproduced, with permission, from Shanks RG: The pharmacology of Bsympathetic blockade. Am J Cardiol 1966; 18: 312.)

Overall, although the acute effects of these drugs may include a rise in peripheral resistance, chronic drug administration leads to a fall in peripheral resistance in patients with hypertension. How this adjustment occurs is not yet clear.

\section*{EFFECTS ON THE RESPIRATORY TRACT}

Blockade of the $B_{2}$ receptors in bronchial smooth muscle may lead to an increase in airway resistance, particularly in patients with asthma. Beta ${ }_{1}$-receptor antagonists such as metoprolol and atenolol may have some advantage over nonselective Bantagonists when blockade of $\mathrm{B}_{1}$ receptors in the heart is desired and $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ receptor blockade is undesirable. However, no currently available $B_{1}$-selective antagonist is sufficiently specific to completely avoid interactions with $B_{2}$ adrenoceptors. Consequently, these drugs should generally be avoided in patients with asthma. On the other hand, many patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may tolerate these drugs quite well and the benefits, for example in patients with concomitant ischemic heart disease, may outweigh the risks.

\section*{EFFECTS ON THE EYE}

Several B-blocking agents reduce intraocular pressure, especially in glaucomatous eyes. The mechanism usuall reported is decreased aqueous humor production. (See Clinical Pharmacology and The Treatment of Glaucoma. The Treatment of Glaucoma

Glaucoma is a major cause of blindness and of great pharmacologic interest because the chronic form often
responds to drug therapy. The primary manifestation is increased intraocular pressure not initially associated with symptoms. Without treatment, increased intraocular pressure results in damage to the retina and optic nerve, with restriction of visual fields and, eventually, blindness. Intraocular pressure is easily measured as par of the routine ophthalmologic examination. Two major types of glaucoma are recognized: open-angle and closed-angle (or narrow-angle). The closed-angle form is associated with a shallow anterior chamber, in which i dilated iris can occlude the outflow drainage pathway at the angle between the cornea and the ciliary body (se Figure 6-9). This form is associated with acute and painful increases of pressure, which must be controlled on an emergency basis with drugs or prevented by surgical removal of part of the iris (iridectomy). The open-angle form of glaucoma is a chronic condition, and treatment is largely pharmacologic. Because intraocular pressure i a function of the balance between fluid input and drainage out of the globe, the strategies for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma fall into two classes: reduction of aqueous humor secretion and enhancement of aqueous outflow. Five general groups of drugs-cholinomimetics, agonists, Bblockers, prostaglandin $F_{2}$ analogs, and diuretics-have been found to be useful in reducing intraocular pressure and can be related to these strategies as shown in Table 10-3. Of the five drug groups listed in Table 10-3, the prostaglandin analogs and the $B$ blockers are the most popular. This popularity results from convenience (once- or twice-daily dosing) and relative lack of adverse effects (except, in the case of Bblockers, in patients with asthma or cardiac pacemaker or conduction pathway disease). Other drugs that have been reported to reduce intraocular pressure include prostaglandin $\mathrm{E}_{2}$ and marijuana. The use of drugs in acute closed-angle glaucoma is limited to cholinomimetics, acetazolamide, and osmotic agents preceding surgery. The onset of action of the other agents is too slow in thi situation.

\section*{METABOLIC AND ENDOCRINE EFFECTS}

Beta-receptor antagonists such as propranolol inhibit sympathetic nervous system stimulation of lipolysis. The effects on carbohydrate metabolism are less clear, though glycogenolysis in the human liver is at least partially inhibited after $B_{2}$-receptor blockade. However, glucagon is the primary hormone used to combat hypoglycemia It is unclear to what extent Bantagonists impair recovery from hypoglycemia, but they should be used with caution in insulin-dependent diabetic patients. This may be particularly important in diabetic patients with inadequate glucagon reserve and in pancreatectomized patients since catecholamines may be the major factors in stimulating glucose release from the liver in response to hypoglycemia. Beta ${ }_{1}$-receptor-selective drugs may be less prone to inhibit recovery from hypoglycemia. Beta-receptor antagonists are much safer in those type 2 diabetic patients who do not have hypoglycemic episodes.

The chronic use of B-adrenoceptor antagonists has been associated with increased plasma concentrations of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and decreased concentrations of HDL cholesterol. Both of these changes are potentially unfavorable in terms of risk of cardiovascular disease. Although low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations generally do not change, there is a variable decline in the HDL cholesterol/LDL cholesterol ratio that may increase the risk of coronary artery disease. These changes tend to occur with both selective and nonselective $B$-blockers, though they are perhaps less likely to occur with $B$-blockers possessing intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (partial agonists). The mechanisms by which B-receptor antagonists cause these changes are not understood, though changes in sensitivity to insulin action may contribute.

\section*{EFFECTS NOT RELATED TO BETA-BLOCKADE}

Partial B -agonist activity was significant in the first B -blocking drug synthesized, dichloroisoproterenol. It has been suggested that retention of some intrinsic sympathomimetic activity is desirable to prevent untoward effects such as precipitation of asthma or excessive bradycardia. Pindolol and other partial agonists are noted ir Table 10-2. It is not yet clear to what extent partial agonism is clinically valuable. Furthermore, these drugs may not be as effective as the pure antagonists in secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. However, the may be useful in patients who develop symptomatic bradycardia or bronchoconstriction in response to pure antagonist B -adrenoceptor drugs, but only if they are strongly indicated for a particular clinical indication.

Local anesthetic action, also known as "membrane-stabilizing" action, is a prominent effect of several Bblockers (Table 10-2). This action is the result of typical local anesthetic blockade of sodium channels and can be demonstrated experimentally in isolated neurons, heart muscle, and skeletal muscle membrane. However, it is unlikely that this effect is important after systemic administration of these drugs, since the concentration in plasma usually achieved by these routes is too low for the anesthetic effects to be evident. These membranestabilizing B-blockers are not used topically on the eye, where local anesthesia of the cornea would be highly undesirable. Sotalol is a nonselective $B$-receptor antagonist that lacks local anesthetic action but has marked class III antiarrhythmic effects, reflecting potassium channel blockade (see Chapter 14).

\section*{SPECI FIC AGENTS}
(See Table 10-2.) Propranolol is the prototypical B-blocking drug. As noted above, it has low and dosedependent bioavailability. A long-acting form of propranolol is available; prolonged absorption of the drug may occur over a 24-hour period. The drug has negligible effects at and muscarinic receptors; however, it may block some serotonin receptors in the brain, though the clinical significance is unclear. It has no detectable partial agonist action at Breceptors.

Metoprolol, atenolol, and several other drugs (see Table 10-2) are members of the $B_{1}$-selective group. Thes agents may be safer in patients who experience bronchoconstriction in response to propranolol. Since their $B_{1}$
selectivity is rather modest, they should be used with great caution, if at all, in patients with a history of asthma. However, in selected patients with chronic obstructive lung disease the benefits may exceed the risks, eg, in patients with myocardial infarction. Beta ${ }_{1}$-selective antagonists may be preferable in patients with diabetes or peripheral vascular disease when therapy with a Bblocker is required, since $B_{2}$ receptors are probably important in liver (recovery from hypoglycemia) and blood vessels (vasodilation).

Nadolol is noteworthy for its very long duration of action; its spectrum of action is similar to that of timolol. Timolol is a nonselective agent with no local anesthetic activity. It has excellent ocular hypotensive effects when administered topically in the eye. Levobunonol (nonselective) and betaxolol ( $\beta_{1}$-selective) are also used for topical ophthalmic application in glaucoma; the latter drug may be less likely to induce bronchoconstriction than nonselective antagonists. Carteolol is a nonselective $B$-receptor antagonist.

Pindolol, acebutolol, carteolol, bopindolol, * oxprenolol, * celiprolol,* and penbutolol are of interest because they have partial B -agonist activity.

They are effective in the major cardiovascular applications of the B-blocking group (hypertension and angina). Although these partial agonists may be less likely to cause bradycardia and abnormalities in plasma lipids than are antagonists, the overall clinical significance of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity remains uncertain. Pindolo perhaps as a result of actions on serotonin signaling, may potentiate the action of traditional antidepressant medications. Celiprolol is a $B_{1}$-selective antagonist with a modest capacity to activate $B_{2}$ receptors.

There is limited evidence suggesting that celiprolol may have less adverse bronchoconstrictor effect in asthma and may even promote bronchodilation. Acebutolol is also a $B_{1}$-selective antagonist.

Labetalol is a reversible adrenoceptor antagonist available as a racemic mixture of two pairs of chiral isomers (the molecule has two centers of asymmetry). The ( $S, S$ ) - and ( $R, S$ ) -isomers are nearly inactive, ( $S, R$ ) - is a potent ablocker, and the ( $\mathrm{R}, \mathrm{R}$ ) -isomer is a potent Bblocker. Labetalol's affinity for areceptors is less than that ( phentolamine, but labetalol is $\alpha_{1}$-selective. Its $\beta$-blocking potency is somewhat lower than that of propranolol. Hypotension induced by labetalol is accompanied by less tachycardia than occurs with phentolamine and similaı ablockers.

Carvedilol, medroxalol, * and bucindolol * are nonselective B-receptor antagonists with some capacity to block $\alpha_{1}$-adrenergic receptors.

Carvedilol antagonizes the actions of catecholamines more potently at Breceptors than at areceptors. The drug has a half-life of 6-8 hours. It is extensively metabolized in the liver, and stereoselective metabolism of its two isomers is observed. Since metabolism of (R)- carvedilol is influenced by polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 2D6 activity and by drugs that inhibit this enzyme's activity (such as quinidine and fluoxetine), drug interaction: may occur. Carvedilol also appears to attenuate oxygen free radical-initiated lipid peroxidation and to inhibit vascular smooth muscle mitogenesis independently of adrenoceptor blockade. These effects may contribute to the clinical benefits of the drug in chronic heart failure (see Chapter 13).

Esmolol is an ultra-short-acting $B_{1}$-selective adrenoceptor antagonist. The structure of esmolol contains an ester linkage; esterases in red blood cells rapidly metabolize esmolol to a metabolite that has a low affinity for [ receptors. Consequently, esmolol has a short half-life (about 10 minutes). Therefore, during continuous infusions of esmolol, steady-state concentrations are achieved quickly, and the therapeutic actions of the drug are terminated rapidly when its infusion is discontinued. Esmolol is potentially safer to use than longer-acting antagonists in critically ill patients who require a B-adrenoceptor antagonist. Esmolol is useful in controlling
supraventricular arrhythmias, arrhythmias associated with thyrotoxicosis, perioperative hypertension, and myocardial ischemia in acutely ill patients.

Butoxamine is a research drug selective for $B_{2}$ receptors. Selective $B_{2}$-blocking drugs have not been actively sought because there is no obvious clinical application for them; none is available for clinical use.
* Not available in the USA.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF THE BETA-RECEPTOR- BLOCKI NG DRUGS}

\section*{Hypertension}

The $B$-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs have proved to be effective and well tolerated in hypertension. Although many hypertensive patients respond to a Bblocker used alone, the drug is often used with either a diuretic or a vasodilator. In spite of the short half-life of many Bantagonists, these drugs may be administered once or twice daily and still have an adequate therapeutic effect. Labetalol, a competitive cand Bantagonist, is effective in hypertension, though its ultimate role is yet to be determined. Use of these agents is discussed in detail in Chapter 11. There is some evidence that drugs in this class may be less effective in blacks and the elderly. However, these differences are relatively small and may not apply to an individual patient. Indeed, since effects on blood pressure are easily measured, the therapeutic outcome for this indication can be readily detected in any patient.

\section*{Ischemic Heart Disease}

Beta-adrenoceptor blockers reduce the frequency of anginal episodes and improve exercise tolerance in many patients with angina (see Chapter 12). These actions relate to the blockade of cardiac Breceptors, resulting in decreased cardiac work and reduction in oxygen demand. Slowing and regularization of the heart rate may contribute to clinical benefits (Figure 10-7). Multiple large-scale prospective studies indicate that the long-term use of timolol, propranolol, or metoprolol in patients who have had a myocardial infarction prolongs surviva (Figure 10-8). At the present time, data are less compelling for the use of other than the three mentioned Badrenoceptor antagonists for this indication. It is significant that surveys in many populations have indicated that $\beta$-receptor antagonists are underused, leading to unnecessary morbidity and mortality. In addition, $\beta$ adrenoceptor antagonists are strongly indicated in the acute phase of a myocardial infarction. In this setting, relative contraindications include bradycardia, hypotension, moderate or severe left ventricular failure, shock, heart block, and active airways disease. It has been suggested that certain polymorphisms in $B_{2}$-adrenoceptor genes may influence survival among patients receiving antagonists after acute coronary syndromes.

Effects of B-blocker therapy on life-table cumulated rates of mortality from all causes over 6 years among 1884 patients surviving myocardial infarctions. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with placebo (dashed line) or timolol (color). (Reproduced, with permission, from Pederson TR: Six-year follow-up of the Norwegian multicenter study on timolol after acute myocardial infarction. N Engl J Med 1985; 313: 1055.)

\section*{Cardiac Arrhythmias}

Beta antagonists are often effective in the treatment of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias (see Chapter 14). It has been suggested that the improved survival following myocardial infarction in patients using Bantagonists (Figure 10-8) is due to suppression of arrhythmias, but this has not been proved. By increasing the atrioventricular nodal refractory period, Bantagonists slow ventricular response rates in atrial flutter and fibrillation. These drugs can also reduce ventricular ectopic beats, particularly if the ectopic activity has been precipitated by catecholamines. Sotalol has additional antiarrhythmic effects involving ion channel blockade in addition to its B-blocking action; these are discussed in Chapter 14.

\section*{Heart Failure}

Clinical trials have demonstrated that at least three Bantagonists—metoprolol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol—are effective in treating chronic heart failure in selected patients. Although administration of these drugs may worsen acute congestive heart failure, cautious long-term use with gradual dose increments in patients who tolerate them may prolong life. Although mechanisms are uncertain, there appear to be beneficial effects on myocardial remodeling and in decreasing the risk of sudden death (see Chapter 13).

\section*{Other Cardiovascular Disorders}

Beta-receptor antagonists have been found to increase stroke volume in some patients with obstructive cardiomyopathy. This beneficial effect is thought to result from the slowing of ventricular ejection and decrease outflow resistance. Beta antagonists are useful in dissecting aortic aneurysm to decrease the rate of development of systolic pressure. Beta antagonists are also useful in selected at-risk patients in the prevention of adverse cardiovascular outcomes resulting from noncardiac surgery.

\section*{Glaucoma}

Systemic administration of B-blocking drugs for other indications was found serendipitously to reduce intraocule pressure in patients with glaucoma (see The Treatment of Glaucoma). Subsequently, it was found that topical administration also reduces intraocular pressure. The mechanism appears to involve reduced production of aqueous humor by the ciliary body, which is physiologically activated by cAMP. Timolol and related Bantagonists are suitable for local use in the eye because they lack local anesthetic properties. Beta antagonists appear to have an efficacy comparable to that of epinephrine or pilocarpine in open-angle glaucoma and are far better tolerated by most patients. While the maximal daily dose applied locally ( 1 mg ) is small compared with the systemic doses commonly used in the treatment of hypertension or angina ( $10-60 \mathrm{mg}$ ), sufficient timolol may be absorbed from the eye to cause serious adverse effects on the heart and airways in susceptible individuals. Topical timolol may interact with orally administered verapamil and increase the risk of heart block.

Betaxolol, carteolol, levobunolol, and metipranolol are B-receptor antagonists approved for the treatment of glaucoma. Betaxolol has the potential advantage of being $B_{1}$-selective; to what extent this potential advantage might diminish systemic adverse effects remains to be determined. The drug apparently has caused worsening of pulmonary symptoms in some patients.

\section*{Hyperthyroidism}

Excessive catecholamine action is an important aspect of the pathophysiology of hyperthyroidism, especially in relation to the heart (see Chapter 38). The Bantagonists have salutary effects in this condition. These beneficial effects presumably relate to blockade of adrenoceptors and perhaps in part to the inhibition of peripheral conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine. The latter action may vary from one Bantagonist to another. Propranolol has been used extensively in patients with thyroid storm (severe hyperthyroidism); it is used cautiously in patients with this condition to control supraventricular tachycardias that often precipitate heart failure.

\section*{Neurologic Diseases}

Several studies show a beneficial effect of propranolol in reducing the frequency and intensity of migraine headache. Other B-receptor antagonists with preventive efficacy include metoprolol and probably also atenolol, timolol, and nadolol. The mechanism is not known. Since sympathetic activity may enhance skeletal muscle tremor, it is not surprising that Bantagonists have been found to reduce certain tremors (see Chapter 28). The somatic manifestations of anxiety may respond dramatically to low doses of propranolol, particularly when take prophylactically. For example, benefit has been found in musicians with performance anxiety ("stage fright"). Propranolol may contribute to the symptomatic treatment of alcohol withdrawal in some patients.

\section*{Miscellaneous}

Beta-receptor antagonists have been found to diminish portal vein pressure in patients with cirrhosis. There is evidence that both propranolol and nadolol decrease the incidence of the first episode of bleeding from esophageal varices and decrease the mortality rate associated with bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. Nadolol i combination with isosorbide mononitrate appears to be more efficacious than sclerotherapy in preventing rebleeding in patients who have previously bled from esophageal varices. Variceal band ligation in combination with a Bantagonist may be more efficacious.

\section*{CHOI CE OF A BETA-ADRENOCEPTOR ANTAGONI ST DRUG}

Propranolol is the standard against which newer Bantagonists developed for systemic use have been compared. In many years of very wide use, propranolol has been found to be a safe and effective drug for many indications. Since it is possible that some actions of a B-receptor antagonist may relate to some other effect of the drug, these drugs should not be considered interchangeable for all applications. For example, only $B$ antagonists known to be effective in stable heart failure or in prophylactic therapy after myocardial infarction should be used for those indications. It is possible that the beneficial effects of one drug in these settings might not be shared by another drug in the same class. The possible advantages and disadvantages of B-receptor antagonists that are partial agonists have not been clearly defined in clinical settings, although current evidenct suggests that they are probably less efficacious in secondary prevention after a myocardial infarction compared to pure antagonists.

\section*{CLI NI CAL TOXI CI TY OF THE BETA-RECEPTOR ANTAGONI ST DRUGS}

A variety of minor toxic effects have been reported for propranolol. Rash, fever, and other manifestations of drug allergy are rare. Central nervous system effects include sedation, sleep disturbances, and depression. Rarely, psychotic reactions may occur. Discontinuing the use of Bblockers in any patient who develops a depression should be seriously considered if clinically feasible. It has been claimed that B-receptor antagonist drugs with low lipid solubility are associated with a lower incidence of central nervous system adverse effects than compounds with higher lipid solubility (see Table 10-2). Further studies designed to compare the central nervous system adverse effects of various drugs are required before specific recommendations can be made,
though it seems reasonable to try the hydrophilic drugs nadolol or atenolol in a patient who experiences unpleasant central nervous system effects with other Bblockers.

The major adverse effects of B-receptor antagonist drugs relate to the predictable consequences of Bblockade. Beta ${ }_{2}$-receptor blockade associated with the use of nonselective agents commonly causes worsening of preexisting asthma and other forms of airway obstruction without having these consequences in normal individuals. Indeed, relatively trivial asthma may become severe after Bblockade. However, because of their lift saving possibilities in cardiovascular disease, strong consideration should be given to individualized therapeutic trials in some classes of patients, eg, those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who have appropriate indications for Bblockers. While B ${ }_{1}$-selective drugs may have less effect on airways than nonselective B antagonists, they must be used very cautiously, if at all, in patients with reactive airways. Beta ${ }_{1}$-selective antagonists are generally well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate peripheral vascular disease, but caution is required in patients with severe peripheral vascular disease or vasospastic disorders.

Beta-receptor blockade depresses myocardial contractility and excitability. In patients with abnormal myocardia function, cardiac output may be dependent on sympathetic drive. If this stimulus is removed by Bblockade, cardiac decompensation may ensue. Thus, caution must be exercised in starting a B-receptor antagonist in patients with compensated heart failure even though long-term use of these drugs in these patients may prolong life. A life-threatening adverse cardiac effect of a Bantagonist may be overcome directly with isoproterenol or with glucagon (glucagon stimulates the heart via glucagon receptors, which are not blocked by Bantagonists), but neither of these methods is without hazard. A very small dose of a Bantagonist (eg, 10 mg o propranolol) may provoke severe cardiac failure in a susceptible individual. Beta blockers may interact with the calcium antagonist verapamil; severe hypotension, bradycardia, heart failure, and cardiac conduction abnormalities have all been described. These adverse effects may even arise in susceptible patients taking a topical (ophthalmic) Bblocker and oral verapamil.

Some hazards are associated with abruptly discontinuing B-antagonist therapy after chronic use. Evidence suggests that patients with ischemic heart disease may be at increased risk if Bblockade is suddenly interrupted. The mechanism of this effect is uncertain but might involve up-regulation of the number of $B$ receptors. Until better evidence is available regarding the magnitude of the risk, prudence dictates the gradual tapering rather than abrupt cessation of dosage when these drugs are discontinued, especially drugs with short half-lives, such as propranolol and metoprolol.

The incidence of hypoglycemic episodes in diabetics that are exacerbated by B-blocking agents is unknown. Nevertheless, it is inadvisable to use Bantagonists in insulin-dependent diabetic patients who are subject to frequent hypoglycemic reactions if alternative therapies are available. Beta ${ }_{1}$-selective antagonists offer some advantage in these patients, since the rate of recovery from hypoglycemia may be faster compared with diabetics receiving nonselective $B$-adrenoceptor antagonists. There is considerable potential benefit from these drugs in diabetics after a myocardial infarction, so the balance of risk versus benefit must be evaluated in individual patients.

\section*{ANTI HYPERTENSI VE AGENTS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular disease. In a survey carried out in 2000, hypertension was found in $28 \%$ of American adults. According to a Framingham study of blood pressure trends in middle-aged and older individuals, approximately $90 \%$ of Caucasian Americans will develop hypertension in their lifetime. The prevalence varies with age, race, education, and many other variables. Sustained arterial hypertension damages blood vessels in kidney, heart, and brain and leads to an increased incidence of renal failure, coronary disease, cardiac failure, and stroke. Effective pharmacologic lowering of blood pressure has been shown to prevent damage to blood vessels and to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality rates. Unfortunately, several surveys indicate that only one third of Americans with hypertension have adequate blood pressure control. Many effective drugs are available. Knowledge of their antihypertensive mechanisms and sites of action allows accurate prediction of efficacy and toxicity. As a result, rational use of these agents, alone or in combination, can lower blood pressure with minimal risk of serious toxicity in most patients.

\section*{Hypertension \& Regulation of Blood Pressure}

\section*{Diagnosis}

The diagnosis of hypertension is based on repeated, reproducible measurements of elevated blood pressure. The diagnosis serves primarily as a prediction of consequences for the patient; it seldom includes a statement about the cause of hypertension.

Epidemiologic studies indicate that the risks of damage to kidney, heart, and brain are directly related to the extent of blood pressure elevation. Even mild hypertension (blood pressure $140 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) increases the risk of eventual end organ damage. Starting at $115 / 75 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ cardiovascular disease risk doubles with each increment of $20 / 10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ throughout the blood pressure range. The risks-and therefore the urgency of instituting therapy-increase in proportion to the magnitude of blood pressure elevation. The risk of end organ damage at any level of blood pressure or age is greater in African-Americans and relatively less in premenopausal women than in men. Other positive risk factors include smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, manifestations of end organ damage at the time of diagnosis, and a family history of cardiovascular disease.

It should be noted that the diagnosis of hypertension depends on measurement of blood pressure and not on symptoms reported by the patient. In fact, hypertension is usually asymptomatic until overt end organ damage is imminent or has already occurred.

\section*{Etiology of Hypertension}

A specific cause of hypertension can be established in only 10-15\% of patients. It is important to consider specific causes in each case, however, because some of them are amenable to definitive surgical treatment: renal artery constriction, coarctation of the aorta, pheochromocytoma, Cushing's disease, and primary aldosteronism.

Patients in whom no specific cause of hypertension can be found are said to have essential hypertension. *
In most cases, elevated blood pressure is associated with an overall increase in resistance to flow of blood through arterioles, while cardiac output is usually normal. Meticulous investigation of autonomic nervous system function, baroreceptor reflexes, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and the kidney has failed to identify a primary abnormality as the cause of increased peripheral vascular resistance in essential
hypertension.
Elevated blood pressure is usually caused by a combination of several (multifactorial) abnormalities. Epidemiologic evidence points to genetic inheritance, psychological stress, and environmental and dietary factors (increased salt and decreased potassium or calcium intake) as perhaps contributing to the development of hypertension. Increase in blood pressure with aging does not occur in populations with low daily sodium intake. Patients with labile hypertension appear more likely than normal controls to have blood pressure elevations after salt loading.

The heritability of essential hypertension is estimated to be about $30 \%$. Mutations in several genes have been linked to various rare causes of hypertension. Functional variations of the genes for angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the $B_{2}$ adrenoceptor, and adducin (a cytoskeletal protein) appear to contribute to some cases of essential hypertension.
*The adjective originally was intended to convey the now abandoned idea that blood pressure elevation was essential for adequate perfusion of diseased tissues.

\section*{Normal Regulation of Blood Pressure}

According to the hydraulic equation, arterial blood pressure (BP) is directly proportionate to the product of the blood flow (cardiac output, CO) and the resistance to passage of blood through precapillary arterioles (peripheral vascular resistance, PVR):
$\mathrm{BP}=\mathrm{CO} \times \mathrm{PVR}$

Physiologically, in both normal and hypertensive individuals, blood pressure is maintained by moment-tomoment regulation of cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance, exerted at three anatomic sites (Figure 11-1): arterioles, postcapillary venules (capacitance vessels), and heart. A fourth anatomic control site, the kidney, contributes to maintenance of blood pressure by regulating the volume of intravascular fluid. Baroreflexes, mediated by autonomic nerves, act in combination with humoral mechanisms, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, to coordinate function at these four control sites and to maintain normal blood pressure. Finally, local release of vasoactive substances from vascular endothelium may also be involved in the regulation of vascular resistance. For example, endothelin-1 (see Chapter 17) constricts and nitric oxide (see Chapter 19) dilates blood vessels.

Anatomic sites of blood pressure control.

Blood pressure in a hypertensive patient is controlled by the same mechanisms that are operative in normotensive subjects. Regulation of blood pressure in hypertensive patients differs from healthy patients in that the baroreceptors and the renal blood volume-pressure control systems appear to be "set" at a higher level of blood pressure. All antihypertensive drugs act by interfering with these normal mechanisms, which are reviewed below.

\section*{POSTURAL BAROREFLEX}
(Figure 11-2) Baroreflexes are responsible for rapid, moment-to-moment adjustments in blood pressure, such as in transition from a reclining to an upright posture. Central sympathetic neurons arising from the vasomotor area of the medulla are tonically active. Carotid baroreceptors are stimulated by the stretch of the vessel walls brought about by the internal pressure (arterial blood pressure). Baroreceptor activation inhibits central sympathetic discharge. Conversely, reduction in stretch results in a reduction in baroreceptor activity. Thus, in the case of a transition to upright posture, baroreceptors sense the reduction in arterial pressure that results from pooling of blood in the veins below the level of the heart as reduced wall stretch, and sympathetic discharge is disinhibited. The reflex increase in sympathetic outflow acts through nerve endings to increase peripheral vascular resistance (constriction of arterioles) and cardiac output (direct stimulation of the heart and constriction of capacitance vessels, which increases venous return to the heart), thereby restoring normal blood pressure. The same baroreflex acts in response to any event that lowers arterial pressure, including a primary reduction in peripheral vascular resistance (eg, caused by a vasodilating agent) or a reduction in intravascular volume (eg, due to hemorrhage or to loss of salt and water via the kidney).

Baroreceptor reflex arc.

\section*{RENAL RESPONSE TO DECREASED BLOOD PRESSURE}

By controlling blood volume, the kidney is primarily responsible for long-term blood pressure control. A reduction in renal perfusion pressure causes intrarenal redistribution of blood flow and increased reabsorption of salt and water. In addition, decreased pressure in renal arterioles as well as sympathetic neural activity (via Badrenoceptors) stimulates production of renin, which increases production of angiotensin II (see Figure 11-1 and Chapter 17). Angiotensin II causes (1) direct constriction of resistance vessels and (2) stimulation of aldosterone synthesis in the adrenal cortex, which increases renal sodium absorption and intravascular blood volume. Vasopressin released from the posterior pituitary gland also plays a role in maintenance of blood pressure through its ability to regulate water reabsorption by the kidney (see Chapters 15 and 17).

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF ANTI HYPERTENSI VE AGENTS}

All antihypertensive agents act at one or more of the four anatomic control sites depicted in Figure 11-1 and produce their effects by interfering with normal mechanisms of blood pressure regulation. A useful classification of these agents categorizes them according to the principal regulatory site or mechanism on which they act (Figure 11-3). Because of their common mechanisms of action, drugs within each category tend to produce a similar spectrum of toxicities. The categories include the following:
(1) Diuretics, which lower blood pressure by depleting the body of sodium and reducing blood volume and perhaps by other mechanisms.
(2) Sympathoplegic agents, which lower blood pressure by reducing peripheral vascular resistance, inhibiting cardiac function, and increasing venous pooling in capacitance vessels. (The latter two effects reduce cardiac output.) These agents are further subdivided according to their putative sites of action in the sympathetic reflex arc (see below).
(3) Direct vasodilators, which reduce pressure by relaxing vascular smooth muscle, thus dilating resistance vessels and-to varying degrees-increasing capacitance as well.
(4) Agents that block production or action of angiotensin and thereby reduce peripheral vascular resistance and (potentially) blood volume.

Sites of action of the major classes of antihypertensive drugs.

The fact that these drug groups act by different mechanisms permits the combination of drugs from two or more groups with increased efficacy and, in some cases, decreased toxicity. (See Monotherapy Versus Polypharmacy in Hypertension.)

\section*{Monotherapy versus Polypharmacy in Hypertension}

Monotherapy of hypertension (treatment with a single drug) is desirable because compliance is likely to be better, cost is lower, and because in some cases adverse effects are fewer. However, most patients with hypertension require two or more drugs, each acting by a different mechanism (polypharmacy). The rationale for polypharmacy is that each of the drugs acts on one of a set of interacting, mutually compensatory regulatory mechanisms for maintaining blood pressure (see Figures 6-7 and 11-1).

For example, because an adequate dose of hydralazine causes a significant decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, there will initially be a drop in mean arterial blood pressure, evoking a strong response in the form of compensatory tachycardia and salt and water retention (Figure 11-4). The result is an increase in cardiac output that is capable of almost completely reversing the effect of hydralazine. The addition of a Bblocker prevents the tachycardia; addition of a diuretic (eg, hydrochlorothiazide) prevents the salt and water retention. In effect, all three drugs increase the sensitivity of the cardiovascular system to each other's actions. Thus, partial impairment of one regulatory mechanism (sympathetic discharge to the heart) increases the antihypertensive effect of impairing regulation by another mechanism (peripheral vascular resistance). Finally, in some circumstances, a normal compensatory response accounts for the toxicity of an antihypertensive agent, and the toxic effect can be prevented by administering a second type of drug. In the case of hydralazine, compensatory tachycardia and increased cardiac output may precipitate angina in patients with coronary atherosclerosis. Addition of the Bblocker and diuretic can prevent this toxicity in many patients.
Figure 11-4.

Compensatory responses to vasodilators; basis for combination therapy with Bblockers and diuretics. 1 Effect blocked by diuretics. 2 Effect blocked by Bblockers.

In practice, when hypertension does not respond adequately to a regimen of one drug, a second drug from a different class with a different mechanism of action and different pattern of toxicity is added. If the response is still inadequate and compliance is known to be good, a third drug may be added. The drugs least likely to be successful as monotherapy are the vasodilators hydralazine and minoxidil. It is not completely clear why other vasodilators such as calcium channel blockers cause less marked compensatory responses for the same amount of blood pressure lowering.

\section*{Drugs That Alter Sodium \& Water Balance}

Dietary sodium restriction has been known for many years to decrease blood pressure in hypertensive patients. With the advent of diuretics, sodium restriction was thought to be less important. However, there is now general agreement that dietary control of blood pressure is a relatively nontoxic therapeutic measure and may even be preventive. Several studies have shown that even modest dietary sodium restriction lowers blood pressure (although to varying extents) in many hypertensive individuals.

\section*{Mechanisms of Action \& Hemodynamic Effects of Diuretics}

Diuretics lower blood pressure primarily by depleting body sodium stores. Initially, diuretics reduce blood pressure by reducing blood volume and cardiac output; peripheral vascular resistance may increase. After 6-8 weeks, cardiac output returns toward normal while peripheral vascular resistance declines. Sodium is believed to contribute to vascular resistance by increasing vessel stiffness and neural reactivity, possibly related to increased sodium-calcium exchange with a resultant increase in intracellular calcium. These effects are reversed by diuretics or sodium restriction.

Some diuretics have direct vasodilating effects in addition to their diuretic action. Indapamide is a nonthiazide sulfonamide diuretic with both diuretic and vasodilator activity. As a consequence of vasodilation, cardiac output remains unchanged or increases slightly. Amiloride inhibits smooth muscle responses to contractile stimuli, probably through effects on transmembrane and intracellular calcium movement that are independent of its action on sodium excretion.

Diuretics are effective in lowering blood pressure by $10-15 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ in most patients, and diuretics alone often provide adequate treatment for mild or moderate essential hypertension. In more severe hypertension, diuretics are used in combination with sympathoplegic and vasodilator drugs to control the tendency toward sodium retention caused by these agents. Vascular responsiveness-ie, the ability to either constrict or dilate-is diminished by sympathoplegic and vasodilator drugs, so that the vasculature behaves like an inflexible tube. As a consequence, blood pressure becomes exquisitely sensitive to blood volume. Thus, in severe hypertension, when multiple drugs are used, blood pressure may be well controlled when blood volume is $95 \%$ of normal but much too high when blood volume is $105 \%$ of normal.

\section*{Use of Diuretics}

The sites of action within the kidney and the pharmacokinetics of various diuretic drugs are discussed in Chapter 15. Thiazide diuretics are appropriate for most patients with mild or moderate hypertension and normal renal and cardiac function. More powerful diuretics (eg, those acting on the loop of Henle) are necessary in severe hypertension, when multiple drugs with sodium-retaining properties are used; in renal insufficiency, when glomerular filtration rate is less than 30 or $40 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$; and in cardiac failure or cirrhosis, where sodium retention is marked.

Potassium-sparing diuretics are useful both to avoid excessive potassium depletion, particularly in patients taking digitalis, and to enhance the natriuretic effects of other diuretics. Aldosterone receptor antagonists in particular also have a favorable effect on cardiac function in people with heart failure.

Some pharmacokinetic characteristics and the initial and usual maintenance dosages of hydrochlorothiazide are listed in Table 11-1. Although thiazide diuretics are more natriuretic at higher doses (up to 100-200 mg of hydrochlorothiazide), when used as a single agent, lower doses ( $25-50 \mathrm{mg}$ ) exert as much antihypertensive effect as do higher doses. In contrast to thiazides, the blood pressure response to loop diuretics continues to increase at doses many times greater than the usual therapeutic dose.

\section*{Toxicity of Diuretics}

In the treatment of hypertension, the most common adverse effect of diuretics (except for potassium-sparing diuretics) is potassium depletion. Although mild degrees of hypokalemia are tolerated well by many patients, hypokalemia may be hazardous in persons taking digitalis, those who have chronic arrhythmias, or those with acute myocardial infarction or left ventricular dysfunction. Potassium loss is coupled to reabsorption of
sodium, and restriction of dietary sodium intake will therefore minimize potassium loss. Diuretics may also cause magnesium depletion, impair glucose tolerance, and increase serum lipid concentrations. Diuretics increase uric acid concentrations and may precipitate gout. The use of low doses minimizes these adverse metabolic effects without impairing the antihypertensive action. Several case-control studies have reported a small but significant excess risk of renal cell carcinoma associated with diuretic use. Potassium-sparing diuretics may produce hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency and those taking ACE inhibitors or angiotension receptor blockers; spironolactone (a steroid) is associated with gynecomastia.

\section*{Drugs That Alter Sympathetic Nervous System Function}

In patients with moderate to severe hypertension, most effective drug regimens include an agent that inhibits function of the sympathetic nervous system. Drugs in this group are classified according to the site at which they impair the sympathetic reflex arc (Figure 11-2). This neuroanatomic classification explains prominent differences in cardiovascular effects of drugs and allows the clinician to predict interactions of these drugs with one another and with other drugs.

Most importantly, the subclasses of drugs exhibit different patterns of potential toxicity. Drugs that lower blood pressure by actions on the central nervous system tend to cause sedation and mental depression and may produce disturbances of sleep, including nightmares. Drugs that act by inhibiting transmission through autonomic ganglia produce toxicity from inhibition of parasympathetic regulation, in addition to profound sympathetic blockade. Drugs that act chiefly by reducing release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve endings cause effects that are similar to those of surgical sympathectomy, including inhibition of ejaculation, and hypotension that is increased by upright posture and after exercise. Drugs that block postsynaptic adrenoceptors produce a more selective spectrum of effects depending on the class of receptor to which they bind.

Finally, one should note that all of the agents that lower blood pressure by altering sympathetic function can elicit compensatory effects through mechanisms that are not dependent on adrenergic nerves. Thus, the antihypertensive effect of any of these agents used alone may be limited by retention of sodium by the kidney and expansion of blood volume. For these reasons, sympathoplegic antihypertensive drugs are most effective when used concomitantly with a diuretic.

\section*{CENTRALLY ACTI NG SYMPATHOPLEGI C DRUGS}

\section*{Mechanisms \& Sites of Action}

These agents reduce sympathetic outflow from vasopressor centers in the brainstem but allow these centers to retain or even increase their sensitivity to baroreceptor control. Accordingly, the antihypertensive and toxic actions of these drugs are generally less dependent on posture than are the effects of drugs that act directly on peripheral sympathetic neurons.

Methyldopa ( L-a-methyl-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) is an analog of L-dopa and is converted to a.methyldopamine and $\alpha$-methylnorepinephrine; this pathway directly parallels the synthesis of norepinephrine from dopa illustrated in Figure 6-5. Alpha-methylnorepinephrine is stored in adrenergic nerve vesicles, where it stoichiometrically replaces norepinephrine, and is released by nerve stimulation to interact with postsynaptic adrenoceptors. However, this replacement of norepinephrine by a false transmitter in peripheral neurons is not responsible for methyldopa's antihypertensive effect, because the a-methylnorepinephrine released is an effective agonist at the cadrenoceptors that mediate peripheral sympathetic constriction of
arterioles and venules. Direct electrical stimulation of sympathetic nerves in methyldopa-treated animals produces sympathetic responses similar to those observed in untreated animals.

In fact, methyldopa's antihypertensive action appears to be due to stimulation of central a cadrenoceptors by -methylnorepinephrine or a-methyldopamine, based on the following evidence: (1) Much lower doses of methyldopa are required to lower blood pressure in animals when the drug is administered centrally by injection into the cerebral ventricles rather than intravenously. (2) Alpha-receptor antagonists, especially $\omega_{2}$ selective antagonists, administered centrally, block the antihypertensive effect of methyldopa, whether the latter is given centrally or intravenously. (3) Potent inhibitors of dopa decarboxylase, administered centrally, block methyldopa's antihypertensive effect, thus showing that metabolism of the parent drug in the central nervous system is necessary for its action.

The antihypertensive action of clonidine, a 2-imidazoline derivative, was discovered in the course of testing the drug for use as a topically applied nasal decongestant.

After intravenous injection, clonidine produces a brief rise in blood pressure followed by more prolonged hypotension. The pressor response is due to direct stimulation of adrenoceptors in arterioles. The drug is classified as a partial agonist at areceptors because it also inhibits pressor effects of other a.agonists.

Considerable evidence indicates that the hypotensive effect of clonidine is exerted at adrenoceptors in the medulla of the brain. In animals, the hypotensive effect of clonidine is prevented by central administration of a.antagonists. Clonidine reduces sympathetic and increases parasympathetic tone, resulting in blood pressure lowering and bradycardia. The reduction in pressure is accompanied by a decrease in circulating catecholamine levels. These observations suggest that clonidine sensitizes brainstem pressor centers to inhibition by baroreflexes.

Thus, studies of clonidine and methyldopa suggest that normal regulation of blood pressure involves central adrenergic neurons that modulate baroreceptor reflexes. Clonidine and a.-methylnorepinephrine bind more tightly to $\alpha_{2}$ than to $\alpha_{1}$ adrenoceptors. As noted in Chapter 6, $\alpha_{2}$ receptors are located on presynaptic adrenergic neurons as well as some postsynaptic sites. It is possible that clonidine and a.methylnorepinephrine act in the brain to reduce norepinephrine release onto relevant receptor sites. Alternatively, these drugs may act on postsynaptic 2 adrenoceptors to inhibit activity of appropriate neurons. Finally, clonidine also binds to a nonadrenoceptor site, the imidazoline receptor, which may also mediate antihypertensive effects.

Methyldopa and clonidine produce slightly different hemodynamic effects: clonidine lowers heart rate and cardiac output more than does methyldopa. This difference suggests that these two drugs do not have identical sites of action. They may act primarily on different populations of neurons in the vasomotor centers of the brainstem.

Guanabenz and guanfacine are centrally active antihypertensive drugs that share the central a.-adrenoceptor-stimulating effects of clonidine. They do not appear to offer any advantages over clonidine.

\section*{METHYLDOPA}

Methyldopa is useful in the treatment of mild to moderately severe hypertension. It lowers blood pressure chiefly by reducing peripheral vascular resistance, with a variable reduction in heart rate and cardiac output.

Most cardiovascular reflexes remain intact after administration of methyldopa, and blood pressure reduction is
not markedly dependent on maintenance of upright posture. Postural (orthostatic) hypotension sometimes occurs, particularly in volume-depleted patients. One potential advantage of methyldopa is that it causes reduction in renal vascular resistance.

$\alpha$-Methyldopa
( $\alpha$-methyl group in color)

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

Pharmacokinetic characteristics of methyldopa are listed in Table 11-1. Methyldopa enters the brain via an aromatic amino acid transporter. The usual oral dose of methyldopa produces its maximal antihypertensive effect in 4-6 hours, and the effect can persist for up to 24 hours. Because the effect depends on accumulation and storage of a metabolite (c.-methylnorepinephrine) in the vesicles of nerve endings, the action persists after the parent drug has disappeared from the circulation.

\section*{Toxicity}

The most frequent undesirable effect of methyldopa is overt sedation, particularly at the onset of treatment. With long-term therapy, patients may complain of persistent mental lassitude and impaired mental concentration. Nightmares, mental depression, vertigo, and extrapyramidal signs may occur but are relatively infrequent. Lactation, associated with increased prolactin secretion, can occur both in men and in women treated with methyldopa. This toxicity is probably mediated by inhibition of dopaminergic mechanisms in the hypothalamus.

Other important adverse effects of methyldopa are development of a positive Coombs test (occurring in 10-20\% of patients undergoing therapy for longer than 12 months), which sometimes makes cross-matching blood for transfusion difficult and rarely is associated with hemolytic anemia, as well as hepatitis and drug fever. Discontinuation of the drug usually results in prompt reversal of these abnormalities.

\section*{CLONI DI NE}

Hemodynamic studies indicate that blood pressure lowering by clonidine results from reduction of cardiac output due to decreased heart rate and relaxation of capacitance vessels, with a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, particularly when patients are upright (when sympathetic tone is normally increased).

Reduction in arterial blood pressure by clonidine is accompanied by decreased renal vascular resistance and maintenance of renal blood flow. As with methyldopa, clonidine reduces blood pressure in the supine position and only rarely causes postural hypotension. Pressor effects of clonidine are not observed after ingestion of therapeutic doses of clonidine, but severe hypertension can complicate a massive overdose.

\section*{Clonidine}

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

Typical pharmacokinetic characteristics are listed in Table 11-1.
Clonidine is lipid-soluble and rapidly enters the brain from the circulation. Because of its relatively short halflife and the fact that its antihypertensive effect is directly related to blood concentration, oral clonidine must be given twice a day (or as a patch, below) to maintain smooth blood pressure control. However, as is not the case with methyldopa, the dose-response curve of clonidine is such that increasing doses are more effective (but also more toxic).

A transdermal preparation of clonidine that reduces blood pressure for 7 days after a single application is also available. This preparation appears to produce less sedation than clonidine tablets but is often associated with local skin reactions.

\section*{Toxicity}

Dry mouth and sedation are frequent and may be severe. Both effects are centrally mediated and dosedependent and coincide temporally with the drug's antihypertensive effect.

The drug should not be given to patients who are at risk for mental depression and should be withdrawn if depression occurs during therapy. Concomitant treatment with tricyclic antidepressants may block the antihypertensive effect of clonidine. The interaction is believed to be due to a of the tricyclics.

Withdrawal of clonidine after protracted use, particularly with high dosages (greater than $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ), can result in life-threatening hypertensive crisis mediated by increased sympathetic nervous activity. Patients exhibit nervousness, tachycardia, headache, and sweating after omitting one or two doses of the drug. Although the incidence of severe hypertensive crisis is unknown, it is high enough to require that all patients who take clonidine be carefully warned of the possibility. If the drug must be stopped, this should be done gradually while other antihypertensive agents are being substituted. Treatment of the hypertensive crisis consists of reinstitution of clonidine therapy or administration of $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-adrenoceptor-blocking agents.

\section*{GANGLI ON-BLOCKI NG AGENTS}

Historically, drugs that block stimulation of postganglionic autonomic neurons by acetylcholine were among the first agents used in the treatment of hypertension. Most such drugs are no longer available clinically because of intolerable toxicities related to their primary action (see below).

Ganglion blockers competitively block nicotinic cholinoceptors on postganglionic neurons in both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia. In addition, these drugs may directly block the nicotinic acetylcholine channel, in the same fashion as neuromuscular nicotinic blockers (see Figure 27-6).

The adverse effects of ganglion blockers are direct extensions of their pharmacologic effects. These effects include both sympathoplegia (excessive orthostatic hypotension and sexual dysfunction) and parasympathoplegia (constipation, urinary retention, precipitation of glaucoma, blurred vision, dry mouth, etc). These severe toxicities are the major reason for the abandonment of ganglion blockers for the therapy of hypertension.

\section*{ADRENERGIC NEURON- BLOCKI NG AGENTS}

These drugs lower blood pressure by preventing normal physiologic release of norepinephrine from postganglionic sympathetic neurons.

\section*{GUANETHI DI NE}

In high enough doses, guanethidine can produce profound sympathoplegia. The resulting high maximal efficacy of this agent made it the mainstay of outpatient therapy of severe hypertension for many years. For the same reason, guanethidine can produce all of the toxicities expected from "pharmacologic sympathectomy," including marked postural hypotension, diarrhea, and impaired ejaculation. Because of these adverse effects, guanethidine is now rarely used.

Guanethidine is too polar to enter the central nervous system. As a result, this drug has none of the central effects seen with many of the other antihypertensive agents described in this chapter.

Guanadrel is a guanethidine-like drug that is available in the USA. Bethanidine and debrisoquin, antihypertensive agents not available for clinical use in the USA, are similar to guanethidine in mechanism of antihypertensive action.

\section*{Mechanism \& Sites of Action}

Guanethidine inhibits the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve endings (see Figure 6-4). This effect is probably responsible for most of the sympathoplegia that occurs in patients. Guanethidine is transported across the sympathetic nerve membrane by the same mechanism that transports norepinephrine itself (NET, uptake 1), and uptake is essential for the drug's action. Once guanethidine has entered the nerve, it is concentrated in transmitter vesicles, where it replaces norepinephrine. Because it replaces norepinephrine, the drug causes a gradual depletion of norepinephrine stores in the nerve ending.

Inhibition of norepinephrine release is probably caused by guanethidine's local anesthetic properties on sympathetic nerve terminals. Although the drug does not impair axonal conduction in sympathetic fibers, local blockade of membrane electrical activity may occur in nerve endings because the nerve endings specifically take up and concentrate the drug.

Because neuronal uptake is necessary for the hypotensive activity of guanethidine, drugs that block the catecholamine uptake process or displace amines from the nerve terminal (see Chapter 6) block its effects. These include cocaine, amphetamine, tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, and phenoxybenzamine.

Guanethidine increases sensitivity to the hypertensive effects of exogenously administered sympathomimetic amines. This results from inhibition of neuronal uptake of such amines and, after long-term therapy with guanethidine, supersensitivity of effector smooth muscle cells, in a fashion analogous to the process that follows surgical sympathectomy (see Chapter 6).

The hypotensive action of guanethidine early in the course of therapy is associated with reduced cardiac output, due to bradycardia and relaxation of capacitance vessels. With long-term therapy, peripheral vascular
resistance decreases. Compensatory sodium and water retention may be marked during guanethidine therapy.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

Because of its long half-life (5 days) the onset of sympathoplegia is gradual (maximal effect in 1-2 weeks), and sympathoplegia persists for a comparable period after cessation of therapy. The dose should not ordinarily be increased at intervals shorter than 2 weeks.

\section*{Toxicity}

Therapeutic use of guanethidine is often associated with symptomatic postural hypotension and hypotension following exercise, particularly when the drug is given in high doses, and may produce dangerously decreased blood flow to heart and brain or even overt shock. Guanethidine-induced sympathoplegia in men may be associated with delayed or retrograde ejaculation (into the bladder). Guanethidine commonly causes diarrhea, which results from increased gastrointestinal motility due to parasympathetic predominance in controlling the activity of intestinal smooth muscle.

Interactions with other drugs may complicate guanethidine therapy. Sympathomimetic agents, at doses available in over-the-counter cold preparations, can produce hypertension in patients taking guanethidine. Similarly, guanethidine can produce hypertensive crisis by releasing catecholamines in patients with pheochromocytoma. When tricyclic antidepressants are administered to patients taking guanethidine, the drug's antihypertensive effect is attenuated, and severe hypertension may follow.

\section*{RESERPINE}

Reserpine, an alkaloid extracted from the roots of an Indian plant, Rauwolfia serpentina, was one of the first effective drugs used on a large scale in the treatment of hypertension. At present, it is considered an effective and relatively safe drug for treating mild to moderate hypertension.

\section*{Mechanism \& Sites of Action}

Reserpine blocks the ability of aminergic transmitter vesicles to take up and store biogenic amines, probably by interfering with the vesicular membrane-associated transporter (VMAT, see Figure 6-4). This effect occurs throughout the body, resulting in depletion of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin in both central and peripheral neurons. Chromaffin granules of the adrenal medulla are also depleted of catecholamines, although to a lesser extent than are the vesicles of neurons. Reserpine's effects on adrenergic vesicles appear irreversible; trace amounts of the drug remain bound to vesicular membranes for many days. Although sufficiently high doses of reserpine in animals can reduce catecholamine stores to zero, lower doses cause inhibition of neurotransmission that is roughly proportionate to the degree of amine depletion.

Depletion of peripheral amines probably accounts for much of the beneficial antihypertensive effect of reserpine, but a central component cannot be ruled out. The effects of low but clinically effective doses resemble those of centrally acting agents (eg, methyldopa) in that sympathetic reflexes remain largely intact, blood pressure is reduced in supine as well as in standing patients, and postural hypotension is mild. Reserpine readily enters the brain, and depletion of cerebral amine stores causes sedation, mental depression, and parkinsonism symptoms.

At lower doses used for treatment of mild hypertension, reserpine lowers blood pressure by a combination of decreased cardiac output and decreased peripheral vascular resistance.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

See Table 11-1.

\section*{Toxicity}

At the low doses usually administered, reserpine produces little postural hypotension. Most of the unwanted effects of reserpine result from actions on the brain or gastrointestinal tract.

High doses of reserpine characteristically produce sedation, lassitude, nightmares, and severe mental depression; occasionally, these occur even in patients receiving low doses ( $0.25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ). Much less frequently, ordinary low doses of reserpine produce extrapyramidal effects resembling Parkinson's disease, probably as a result of dopamine depletion in the corpus striatum. Although these central effects are uncommon, it should be stressed that they may occur at any time, even after months of uneventful treatment. Patients with a history of mental depression should not receive reserpine, and the drug should be stopped if depression appears.

Reserpine rather often produces mild diarrhea and gastrointestinal cramps and increases gastric acid secretion. The drug should probably not be given to patients with a history of peptic ulcer.

\section*{ADRENOCEPTOR ANTAGONI STS}

The pharmacology of $\alpha$ - and $B$-adrenoceptor blockers is presented in Chapter 10. This chapter will concentrate on two prototypical drugs, propranolol and prazosin, primarily in relation to their use in treatment of hypertension. Other adrenoceptor antagonists will be considered only briefly.

\section*{PROPRANOLOL}

Propranolol was the first Bblocker shown to be effective in hypertension and ischemic heart disease. It is now clear that all $B$-adrenoceptor-blocking agents are very useful for lowering blood pressure in mild to moderate hypertension. In severe hypertension, Bblockers are especially useful in preventing the reflex tachycardia that often results from treatment with direct vasodilators. Beta blockers have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure, and they are particularly advantageous for treating hypertension in that population (see Chapter 13).

\section*{Mechanism \& Sites of Action}

Propranolol's efficacy in treating hypertension as well as most of its toxic effects result from nonselective $B$ blockade. Propranolol decreases blood pressure primarily as a result of a decrease in cardiac output. Other B blockers may decrease cardiac output or decrease peripheral vascular resistance to various degrees, depending on cardioselectivity and partial agonist activities.

Beta blockade in brain, kidney, and peripheral adrenergic neurons has been proposed as contributing to the antihypertensive effect observed with B-receptor blockers. In spite of conflicting evidence, the brain appears unlikely to be the primary site of the hypotensive action of these drugs, because some Bblockers that do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier (eg, nadolol, described below) are nonetheless effective antihypertensive agents.

Propranolol inhibits the stimulation of renin production by catecholamines (mediated by $B_{1}$ receptors). It is likely that propranolol's effect is due in part to depression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Although most effective in patients with high plasma renin activity, propranolol also reduces blood pressure in hypertensive patients with normal or even low renin activity. Beta blockers might also act on peripheral
presynaptic Badrenoceptors to reduce sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve activity.
In mild to moderate hypertension, propranolol produces a significant reduction in blood pressure without prominent postural hypotension.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

See Table 11-1. Resting bradycardia and a reduction in the heart rate during exercise are indicators of propranolol's B-blocking effect. Measures of these responses may be used as guides in regulating dosage. Propranolol can be administered once or twice daily and slow-release preparations are available.

\section*{Toxicity}

The principal toxicities of propranolol result from blockade of cardiac, vascular, or bronchial Breceptors and are described in more detail in Chapter 10. The most important of these predictable extensions of the Bblocking action occur in patients with bradycardia or cardiac conduction disease, asthma, peripheral vascular insufficiency, and diabetes.

When propranolol is discontinued after prolonged regular use, some patients experience a withdrawal syndrome, manifested by nervousness, tachycardia, increased intensity of angina, or increase of blood pressure. Myocardial infarction has been reported in a few patients. Although the incidence of these complications is probably low, propranolol should not be discontinued abruptly. The withdrawal syndrome may involve up-regulation or supersensitivity of Badrenoceptors.

\section*{OTHER BETA-ADRENOCEPTOR- BLOCKI NG AGENTS}

Of the large number of Bblockers tested, most have been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure. The pharmacologic properties of several of these agents differ from those of propranolol in ways that may confer therapeutic benefits in certain clinical situations.

\section*{Metoprolol}

Metoprolol is approximately equipotent to propranolol in inhibiting stimulation of $B_{1}$ adrenoceptors such as those in the heart but 50 - to 100 -fold less potent than propranolol in blocking $B_{2}$ receptors. Although metoprolol is in other respects very similar to propranolol, its relative cardioselectivity may be advantageous in treating hypertensive patients who also suffer from asthma, diabetes, or peripheral vascular disease. Studies of small numbers of asthmatic patients have shown that metoprolol causes less bronchial constriction than propranolol at doses that produce equal inhibition of $\mathrm{B}_{1}$ adrenoceptor responses. The cardioselectivity is not complete, however, and asthmatic symptoms have been exacerbated by metoprolol. See Table 11-1.

\section*{Nadolol, Carteolol, Atenolol, Betaxolol, \& Bisoprolol}

Nadolol and carteolol, nonselective $B$-receptor antagonists, and atenolol, a $B_{1}$-selective blocker, are not appreciably metabolized and are excreted to a considerable extent in the urine. Betaxolol and bisoprolol are $B$ 1 -selective blockers that are primarily metabolized in the liver but have long half-lives. Because of these relatively long half-lives, these drugs can be administered once daily. Nadolol is usually begun at a dosage of $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, atenolol at $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, carteolol at $2.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, betaxolol at $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, and bisoprolol at $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. Increases in dosage to obtain a satisfactory therapeutic effect should take place no more often than every 4 or 5 days. Patients with reduced renal function should receive correspondingly reduced doses of nadolol, carteolol, and atenolol. It is claimed that atenolol produces fewer central nervous system-related effects than other more lipid-soluble Bantagonists.

\section*{Pindolol, Acebutolol, \& Penbutolol}

Pindolol, acebutolol, and penbutolol are partial agonists, ie, Bblockers with some intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. They lower blood pressure by decreasing vascular resistance and appear to depress cardiac output or heart rate less than other Bblockers, perhaps because of significantly greater agonist than antagonist effects at $B_{2}$ receptors. This may be particularly beneficial for patients with bradyarrhythmias or peripheral vascular disease. Daily doses of pindolol start at 10 mg ; of acebutolol, at 400 mg ; and of penbutolol, at 20 mg .

\section*{Labetalol \& Carvedilol}

Labetalol is formulated as a racemic mixture of four isomers (it has two centers of asymmetry). Two of these isomers—the ( $\mathrm{S}, \mathrm{S}$ ) - and ( $\mathrm{R}, \mathrm{S}$ ) -isomers-are relatively inactive, a third ( $\mathrm{S}, \mathrm{R}$ ) - is a potent ablocker, and the last ( $R, R$ ) - is a potent Bblocker. The B-blocking isomer is thought to have selective $B_{2}$ agonist and nonselective Bantagonist action. Labetalol has a 3:1 ratio of B:c. antagonism after oral dosing. Blood pressure is lowered by reduction of systemic vascular resistance without significant alteration in heart rate or cardiac output. Because of its combined and b-blocking activity, labetalol is useful in treating the hypertension of pheochromocytoma and hypertensive emergencies. Oral daily doses of labetalol range from 200 to 2400 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. Labetalol is given as repeated intravenous bolus injections of $20-80 \mathrm{mg}$ to treat hypertensive emergencies.

Carvedilol, like labetalol, is administered as a racemic mixture. The $S(-)$ isomer is a nonselective $B$ adrenoceptor blocker, but both $S(-)$ and $R(+)$ isomers have approximately equal a-blocking potency. The isomers are stereoselectively metabolized in the liver, which means that their elimination half-lives may differ. The average half-life is $7-10$ hours. The usual starting dosage of carvedilol for ordinary hypertension is 6.25 mg twice daily.

\section*{Esmolol}

Esmolol is a $B_{1}$-selective blocker that is rapidly metabolized via hydrolysis by red blood cell esterases. It has a short half-life ( $9-10$ minutes) and is administered by constant intravenous infusion. Esmolol is generally administered as a loading dose ( $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ), followed by a constant infusion. The infusion is typically started at $50-150 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$, and the dose increased every 5 minutes , up to $300 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$, as needed to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. Esmolol is used for management of intraoperative and postoperative hypertension, and sometimes for hypertensive emergencies, particularly when hypertension is associated with tachycardia.

\section*{PRAZOSI N \& OTHER ALPHA ${ }_{1}$ BLOCKERS}

\section*{Mechanism \& Sites of Action}

Prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin produce most of their antihypertensive effect by selectively blocking $Q_{1}$ receptors in arterioles and venules. These agents produce less reflex tachycardia when lowering blood pressure than do nonselective cantagonists such as phentolamine. Alpha ${ }_{1}$ receptor selectivity allows norepinephrine to exert unopposed negative feedback (mediated by presynaptic $a_{2}$ receptors) on its own release (see Chapter 6); in contrast, phentolamine blocks both presynaptic and postsynaptic areceptors, with the result that reflex activation of sympathetic neurons produces greater release of transmitter onto $B$ receptors and correspondingly greater cardioacceleration.

Alpha blockers reduce arterial pressure by dilating both resistance and capacitance vessels. As expected, blood pressure is reduced more in the upright than in the supine position. Retention of salt and water occurs
when these drugs are administered without a diuretic. The drugs are more effective when used in combination with other agents, such as a Bblocker and a diuretic, than when used alone.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

Pharmacokinetic characteristics of prazosin are listed in Table 11-1. Terazosin is also extensively metabolized but undergoes very little first-pass metabolism and has a half-life of 12 hours. Doxazosin has an intermediate bioavailability and a half-life of 22 hours.

Terazosin can often be given once daily, with doses of $5-20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. Doxazosin is usually given once daily starting at $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ and progressing to $4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ or more as needed. Although long-term treatment with these a. blockers causes relatively little postural hypotension, a precipitous drop in standing blood pressure develops in some patients shortly after the first dose is absorbed. For this reason, the first dose should be small and should be administered at bedtime. While the mechanism of this first-dose phenomenon is not clear, it occurs more commonly in patients who are salt- and volume-depleted.

Aside from the first-dose phenomenon, the reported toxicities of the $a_{1}$ blockers are relatively infrequent and mild. These include dizziness, palpitations, headache, and lassitude. Some patients develop a positive test for antinuclear factor in serum while on prazosin therapy, but this has not been associated with rheumatic symptoms. The $a_{1}$ blockers do not adversely and may even beneficially affect plasma lipid profiles but this action has not been shown to confer any benefit on clinical outcomes.

\section*{OTHER ALPHA-ADRENOCEPTOR- BLOCKI NG AGENTS}

The nonselective agents, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine, are useful in diagnosis and treatment of pheochromocytoma and in other clinical situations associated with exaggerated release of catecholamines (eg, phentolamine may be combined with propranolol to treat the clonidine withdrawal syndrome, described above). Their pharmacology is described in Chapter 10.

\section*{Vasodilators}

\section*{Mechanism \& Sites of Action}

Within this class of drugs are the oral vasodilators, hydralazine and minoxidil, which are used for long-term outpatient therapy of hypertension; the parenteral vasodilators, nitroprusside, diazoxide, and fenoldopam, which are used to treat hypertensive emergencies; and the calcium channel blockers, which are used in both circumstances.

Chapter 12 contains a general discussion of vasodilators. All of the vasodilators useful in hypertension relax smooth muscle of arterioles, thereby decreasing systemic vascular resistance. Sodium nitroprusside also relaxes veins. Decreased arterial resistance and decreased mean arterial blood pressure elicit compensatory responses, mediated by baroreceptors and the sympathetic nervous system (Figure 11-4), as well as renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone. Because sympathetic reflexes are intact, vasodilator therapy does not cause orthostatic hypotension or sexual dysfunction.

Vasodilators work best in combination with other antihypertensive drugs that oppose the compensatory cardiovascular responses. (See Monotherapy Versus Polypharmacy in Hypertension.)

\section*{HYDRALAZI NE}

Hydralazine, a hydrazine derivative, dilates arterioles but not veins. It has been available for many years,
although it was initially thought not to be particularly effective because tachyphylaxis to its antihypertensive effects developed rapidly. The benefits of combination therapy are now recognized, and hydralazine may be used more effectively, particularly in severe hypertension.

Hydralazine is well absorbed and rapidly metabolized by the liver during the first pass, so that bioavailability is low (averaging 25\%) and variable among individuals. It is metabolized in part by acetylation at a rate that appears to be bimodally distributed in the population (see Chapter 4). As a consequence, rapid acetylators have greater first-pass metabolism, lower bioavailability, and less antihypertensive benefit from a given dose than do slow acetylators. The half-life of hydralazine ranges from 1.5 to 3 hours, but vascular effects persist longer than do blood concentrations, possibly due to avid binding to vascular tissue.

Usual dosage ranges from $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ to $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. The higher dosage was selected as the dose at which there is a small possibility of developing the lupus erythematosus-like syndrome described in the next section. However, higher dosages result in greater vasodilation and may be used if necessary. Dosing two or three times daily provides smooth control of blood pressure.

\section*{Toxicity}

The most common adverse effects of hydralazine are headache, nausea, anorexia, palpitations, sweating, and flushing. In patients with ischemic heart disease, reflex tachycardia and sympathetic stimulation may provoke angina or ischemic arrhythmias. With dosages of $400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ or more, there is a 10-20\% incidence-chiefly in persons who slowly acetylate the drug-of a syndrome characterized by arthralgia, myalgia, skin rashes, and fever that resembles lupus erythematosus. The syndrome is not associated with renal damage and is reversed by discontinuance of hydralazine. Peripheral neuropathy and drug fever are other serious but uncommon adverse effects.

\section*{MINOXIDIL}

Minoxidil is a very efficacious orally active vasodilator. The effect results from the opening of potassium channels in smooth muscle membranes by minoxidil sulfate, the active metabolite. Increased potassium permeability stabilizes the membrane at its resting potential and makes contraction less likely. Like hydralazine, minoxidil dilates arterioles but not veins. Because of its greater potential antihypertensive effect, minoxidil should replace hydralazine when maximal doses of the latter are not effective or in patients with renal failure and severe hypertension, who do not respond well to hydralazine.

\section*{Minoxidil}

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

Pharmacokinetic parameters of minoxidil are listed in Table 11-1. Even more than with hydralazine, the use of minoxidil is associated with reflex sympathetic stimulation and sodium and fluid retention. Minoxidil must be used in combination with a Bblocker and a loop diuretic.

\section*{Toxicity}

Tachycardia, palpitations, angina, and edema are observed when doses of Bblockers and diuretics are inadequate. Headache, sweating, and hirsutism, which is particularly bothersome in women, are relatively common. Minoxidil illustrates how one person's toxicity may become another person's therapy. Topical minoxidil (as Rogaine) is used as a stimulant to hair growth for correction of baldness.

\section*{SODI UM NITROPRUSSIDE}

Sodium nitroprusside is a powerful parenterally administered vasodilator that is used in treating hypertensive emergencies as well as severe heart failure. Nitroprusside dilates both arterial and venous vessels, resulting in reduced peripheral vascular resistance and venous return. The action occurs as a result of activation of guanylyl cyclase, either via release of nitric oxide or by direct stimulation of the enzyme. The result is increased intracellular cGMP, which relaxes vascular smooth muscle (see Figure 12-2).

In the absence of heart failure, blood pressure decreases, owing to decreased vascular resistance, while cardiac output does not change or decreases slightly. In patients with heart failure and low cardiac output, output often increases owing to afterload reduction.

Nitroprusside

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

Nitroprusside is a complex of iron, cyanide groups, and a nitroso moiety. It is rapidly metabolized by uptake into red blood cells with liberation of cyanide. Cyanide in turn is metabolized by the mitochondrial enzyme rhodanase, in the presence of a sulfur donor, to the less toxic thiocyanate. Thiocyanate is distributed in extracellular fluid and slowly eliminated by the kidney.

Nitroprusside rapidly lowers blood pressure, and its effects disappear within 1-10 minutes after discontinuation. The drug is given by intravenous infusion. Sodium nitroprusside in aqueous solution is sensitive to light and must therefore be made up fresh before each administration and covered with opaque foil. Infusion solutions should be changed after several hours. Dosage typically begins at $0.5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ and may be increased up to $10 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ as necessary to control blood pressure. Higher rates of infusion, if continued for more than an hour, may result in toxicity. Because of its efficacy and rapid onset of effect, the drug should be administered by infusion pump and arterial blood pressure continuously monitored via intraarterial recording.

\section*{Toxicity}

Other than excessive blood pressure lowering, the most serious toxicity is related to accumulation of cyanide; metabolic acidosis, arrhythmias, excessive hypotension, and death have resulted. In a few cases, toxicity after relatively low doses of nitroprusside suggested a defect in cyanide metabolism. Administration of sodium thiosulfate as a sulfur donor facilitates metabolism of cyanide. Hydroxocobalamin combines with cyanide to form the nontoxic cyanocobalamin. Both have been advocated for prophylaxis or treatment of cyanide poisoning during nitroprusside infusion. Thiocyanate may accumulate over the course of prolonged administration, usually several days or more, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency who do not excrete thiocyanate at a normal rate. Thiocyanate toxicity is manifested as weakness, disorientation, psychosis, muscle spasms, and convulsions, and the diagnosis is confirmed by finding serum concentrations greater than $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Rarely, delayed hypothyroidism occurs, owing to thiocyanate inhibition of iodide uptake by the thyroid. Methemoglobinemia during infusion of nitroprusside has also been reported.

\section*{DI AZOXI DE}

Diazoxide is an effective and relatively long-acting parenterally administered arteriolar dilator that is occasionally used to treat hypertensive emergencies. Injection of diazoxide results in a rapid fall in systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial blood pressure associated with substantial tachycardia and increase in cardiac output. Studies of its mechanism suggest that it prevents vascular smooth muscle contraction by opening potassium channels and stabilizing the membrane potential at the resting level.

Diazoxide

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

Diazoxide is similar chemically to the thiazide diuretics but has no diuretic activity. It is bound extensively to serum albumin and to vascular tissue. Diazoxide is partially metabolized; its metabolic pathways are not well
characterized. The remainder is excreted unchanged. Its half-life is approximately 24 hours, but the relationship between blood concentration and hypotensive action is not well established. The blood pressurelowering effect after a rapid injection is established within 5 minutes and lasts for 4-12 hours.

When diazoxide was first marketed, a dose of 300 mg by rapid injection was recommended. It appears, however, that excessive hypotension can be avoided by beginning with smaller doses ( $50-150 \mathrm{mg}$ ). If necessary, doses of 150 mg may be repeated every 5 minutes until blood pressure is lowered satisfactorily. Nearly all patients respond to a maximum of three or four doses. Alternatively, diazoxide may be administered by intravenous infusion at rates of $15-30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$. Because of reduced protein binding, hypotension occurs after smaller doses in persons with chronic renal failure, and smaller doses should be administered to these patients. The hypotensive effects of diazoxide are also greater if patients are pretreated with Bblockers to prevent the reflex tachycardia and associated increase in cardiac output.

\section*{Toxicity}

The most significant toxicity from diazoxide has been excessive hypotension, resulting from the recommendation to use a fixed dose of 300 mg in all patients. Such hypotension has resulted in stroke and myocardial infarction. The reflex sympathetic response can provoke angina, electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia, and cardiac failure in patients with ischemic heart disease, and diazoxide should be avoided in this situation.

Diazoxide inhibits insulin release from the pancreas (probably by opening potassium channels in the Bcell membrane) and is used to treat hypoglycemia secondary to insulinoma. Occasionally, hyperglycemia complicates diazoxide use, particularly in persons with renal insufficiency.

In contrast to the structurally related thiazide diuretics, diazoxide causes renal salt and water retention. However, because the drug is used for short periods only, this is rarely a problem.

\section*{FENOLDOPAM}

Fenoldopam is a peripheral arteriolar dilator used for hypertensive emergencies and postoperative hypertension. It acts primarily as an agonist of dopamine $D_{1}$ receptors, resulting in dilation of peripheral arteries and natriuresis. The commercial product is a racemic mixture with the (R) -isomer mediating the pharmacologic activity.

Fenoldopam is rapidly metabolized, primarily by conjugation. Its half-life is 10 minutes. The drug is administered by continuous intravenous infusion. Fenoldopam is initiated at a low dosage ( $0.1 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ ), and the dose is then titrated upward every 15 or 20 minutes up to a maximum dose of $1.6 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ or until the desired blood pressure reduction is achieved.

As with other direct vasodilators, the major toxicities are reflex tachycardia, headache, and flushing. Fenoldopam also increases intraocular pressure and should be avoided in patients with glaucoma.

\section*{CALCI UM CHANNEL BLOCKERS}

In addition to their antianginal (see Chapter 12) and antiarrhythmic effects (see Chapter 14), calcium channel blockers also reduce peripheral resistance and blood pressure. The mechanism of action in hypertension (and, in part, in angina) is inhibition of calcium influx into arterial smooth muscle cells.

Verapamil, diltiazem, and the dihydropyridine family (amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, and nisoldipine) are all equally effective in lowering blood pressure, and many
formulations are currently approved for this use in the USA. Hemodynamic differences among calcium channel blockers may influence the choice of a particular agent. Nifedipine and the other dihydropyridine agents are more selective as vasodilators and have less cardiac depressant effect than verapamil and diltiazem. Reflex sympathetic activation with slight tachycardia maintains or increases cardiac output in most patients given dihydropyridines. Verapamil has the greatest depressant effect on the heart and may decrease heart rate and cardiac output. Diltiazem has intermediate actions. The pharmacology and toxicity of these drugs is discussed in more detail in Chapter 12. Doses of calcium channel blockers used in treating hypertension are similar to those used in treating angina. Some epidemiologic studies reported an increased risk of myocardial infarction or mortality in patients receiving short-acting nifedipine for hypertension. It is therefore recommended that short-acting dihydropyridines not be used for hypertension. Sustained-release calcium blockers or calcium blockers with long half-lives provide smoother blood pressure control and are more appropriate for treatment of chronic hypertension. Intravenous nicardipine is available for the treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible, although parenteral verapamil and diltiazem could be used for the same indication. Nicardipine is typically infused at rates of $2-15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{h}$. Oral short-acting nifedipine has been used in emergency management of severe hypertension.

\section*{Inhibitors of Angiotensin}

Renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone play important roles in at least some individuals with essential hypertension. Approximately 20\% of patients with essential hypertension have inappropriately low and 20\% have inappropriately high plasma renin activity. Blood pressure of patients with high-renin hypertension responds well to B-adrenoceptor blockers, which lower plasma renin activity, and to angiotensin inhibitors-supporting a role for excess renin and angiotensin in this population.

\section*{Mechanism \& Sites of Action}

Renin release from the kidney cortex is stimulated by reduced renal arterial pressure, sympathetic neural stimulation, and reduced sodium delivery or increased sodium concentration at the distal renal tubule (see Chapter 17). Renin acts upon angiotensinogen to split off the inactive precursor decapeptide angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then converted, primarily by endothelial ACE, to the arterial vasoconstrictor octapeptide angiotensin II (Figure 11-5), which is in turn converted in the adrenal gland to angiotensin III. Angiotensin II has vasoconstrictor and sodium-retaining activity. Angiotensin II and III both stimulate aldosterone release. Angiotensin may contribute to maintaining high vascular resistance in hypertensive states associated with high plasma renin activity, such as renal arterial stenosis, some types of intrinsic renal disease, and malignant hypertension, as well as in essential hypertension after treatment with sodium restriction, diuretics, or vasodilators. However, even in low-renin hypertensive states, these drugs can lower blood pressure (see below).
Figure 11-5.

Sites of action of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. 1 Site of angiotensin-converting enzyme blockade. 2 Site of receptor blockade.

A parallel system for angiotensin generation exists in several other tissues (eg, heart) and may be responsible for trophic changes such as cardiac hypertrophy. The converting enzyme involved in tissue angiotensin II synthesis is also inhibited by the ACE inhibitors.

Two classes of drugs act specifically on the renin-angiotensin system: the ACE inhibitors and the competitive inhibitors of angiotensin at its receptors, including losartan and other nonpeptide antagonists, and the peptide saralasin. (Saralasin is no longer in clinical use.) An orally active renin antagonist (aliskiren, see Chapter 17) is currently under study.

\section*{ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME (ACE) INHIBITORS}

Captopril (see Figure 17-2) and other drugs in this class inhibit the converting enzyme peptidyl dipeptidase that hydrolyzes angiotensin I to angiotensin II and (under the name plasma kininase) inactivates bradykinin,
a potent vasodilator, which works at least in part by stimulating release of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. The hypotensive activity of captopril results both from an inhibitory action on the renin-angiotensin system and a stimulating action on the kallikrein-kinin system (Figure 11-5). The latter mechanism has been demonstrated by showing that a bradykinin receptor antagonist, icatibant (see Chapter 17), blunts the blood pressurelowering effect of captopril.

Enalapril (see Figure 17-3) is an oral prodrug that is converted by hydrolysis to a converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat, with effects similar to those of captopril. Enalaprilat itself is available only for intravenous use, primarily for hypertensive emergencies. Lisinopril is a lysine derivative of enalaprilat.
Benazepril, fosinopril, moexipril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, and trandolapril are other longacting members of the class. All are prodrugs, like enalapril, and are converted to the active agents by hydrolysis, primarily in the liver.

Angiotensin II inhibitors lower blood pressure principally by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance. Cardiac output and heart rate are not significantly changed. Unlike direct vasodilators, these agents do not result in reflex sympathetic activation and can be used safely in persons with ischemic heart disease. The absence of reflex tachycardia may be due to downward resetting of the baroreceptors or to enhanced parasympathetic activity.

Although converting enzyme inhibitors are most effective in conditions associated with high plasma renin activity, there is no good correlation among subjects between plasma renin activity and antihypertensive response. Accordingly, renin profiling is unnecessary.

ACE inhibitors have a particularly useful role in treating patients with chronic kidney disease because they diminish proteinuria and stabilize renal function (even in the absence of lowering of blood pressure). These benefits probably result from improved intrarenal hemodynamics, with decreased glomerular efferent arteriolar resistance and a resulting reduction of intraglomerular capillary pressure. ACE inhibitors have also proved to be extremely useful in the treatment of heart failure, and after myocardial infarction, and there is recent evidence that ACE inhibitors reduce the incidence of diabetes in patients with high cardiovascular risk (see Chapter 13).

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

Captopril's pharmacokinetic parameters and dosing recommendations are set forth in Table 11-1. Peak concentrations of enalaprilat, the active metabolite, occur 3-4 hours after dosing with enalapril. The half-life of enalaprilat is about 11 hours. Typical doses of enalapril are $10-20 \mathrm{mg}$ once or twice daily. Lisinopril has a half-life of 12 hours. Doses of $10-80 \mathrm{mg}$ once daily are effective in most patients. All of the ACE inhibitors except fosinopril and moexipril are eliminated primarily by the kidneys; doses of these drugs should be reduced in patients with renal insufficiency.

\section*{Toxicity}

Severe hypotension can occur after initial doses of any ACE inhibitor in patients who are hypovolemic due to diuretics, salt restriction, or gastrointestinal fluid loss. Other adverse effects common to all ACE inhibitors include acute renal failure (particularly in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the renal artery of a solitary kidney), hyperkalemia, dry cough sometimes accompanied by wheezing, and angioedema. Hyperkalemia is more likely to occur in patients with renal insufficiency or diabetes. Bradykinin and substance $P$ seem to be responsible for the cough and angioedema seen with ACE inhibition.

The use of ACE inhibitors is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy because of the risk of fetal hypotension, anuria, and renal failure, sometimes associated with fetal malformations or death. Recent evidence also implicates first trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors in increased teratogenic risk. Captopril, particularly when given in high doses to patients with renal insufficiency, may cause neutropenia or proteinuria. Minor toxic effects seen more typically include altered sense of taste, allergic skin rashes, and drug fever, which may occur in as many as $10 \%$ of patients.

Important drug interactions include those with potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics, which can result in hyperkalemia. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may impair the hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors by blocking bradykinin-mediated vasodilation, which is at least in part, prostaglandin mediated.

\section*{ANGI OTENSI N RECEPTOR- BLOCKI NG AGENTS}

Losartan and valsartan were the first marketed blockers of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT ) receptor. More recently, candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, and telmisartan have been released. They have no effect on bradykinin metabolism and are therefore more selective blockers of angiotensin effects than ACE inhibitors. They also have the potential for more complete inhibition of angiotensin action compared with ACE inhibitors because there are enzymes other than ACE that are capable of generating angiotensin II. Angiotensin receptor blockers provide benefits similar to those of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Losartan's pharmacokinetic parameters are listed in Table 11-1. The adverse effects are similar to those described for ACE inhibitors, including the hazard of use during pregnancy. Cough and angioedema can occur but are less common with angiotensin receptor blockers than with ACE inhibitors.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF ANTI HYPERTENSI VE AGENTS}

Hypertension presents a unique problem in therapeutics. It is usually a lifelong disease that causes few symptoms until the advanced stage. For effective treatment, medicines that may be expensive and often produce adverse effects must be consumed daily. Thus, the physician must establish with certainty that hypertension is persistent and requires treatment and must exclude secondary causes of hypertension that might be treated by definitive surgical procedures. Persistence of hypertension, particularly in persons with mild elevation of blood pressure, should be established by finding an elevated blood pressure on at least three different office visits. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring may be the best predictor of risk and therefore of need for therapy in mild hypertension. Isolated systolic hypertension and hypertension in the elderly also benefit from therapy.

Once the presence of hypertension is established, the question of whether or not to treat and which drugs to use must be considered. The level of blood pressure, the age and sex of the patient, the severity of organ damage (if any) due to high blood pressure, and the presence of cardiovascular risk factors must all be considered. At this stage, the patient must be educated about the nature of hypertension and the importance of treatment so that he or she can make an informed decision regarding therapy.

Once the decision is made to treat, a therapeutic regimen must be developed. Selection of drugs is dictated by the level of blood pressure, the presence and severity of end organ damage, and the presence of other diseases. Severe high blood pressure with life-threatening complications requires more rapid treatment with more efficacious drugs. Most patients with essential hypertension, however, have had elevated blood pressure for months or years, and therapy is best initiated in a gradual fashion.

Education about the natural history of hypertension and the importance of treatment compliance as well as potential side effects of drugs is essential. Follow-up visits should be frequent enough to convince the patient that the physician thinks the illness is serious. With each follow-up visit, the importance of treatment should be reinforced and questions concerning dosing or side effects of medication encouraged. Other factors that may improve compliance are simplifying dosing regimens and having the patient monitor blood pressure at home.

\section*{OUTPATI ENT THERAPY OF HYPERTENSI ON}

The initial step in treating hypertension may be nonpharmacologic. As discussed previously, sodium restriction may be effective treatment for many patients with mild hypertension. The average American diet contains about 200 mEq of sodium per day. A reasonable dietary goal in treating hypertension is $70-100 \mathrm{mEq}$ of sodium per day, which can be achieved by not salting food during or after cooking and by avoiding processed foods that contain large amounts of sodium. Eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products with a reduced content of saturated and total fat, and moderation of alcohol intake (no more than two drinks per day) also lower blood pressure.

Weight reduction even without sodium restriction has been shown to normalize blood pressure in up to $75 \%$ of overweight patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Regular exercise has been shown in some but not all studies to lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients.

For pharmacologic management of mild hypertension, blood pressure can be normalized in many patients with a single drug. However, most patients with hypertension require two or more antihypertensive medications. Thiazide diuretics, Bblockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers have all been shown to reduce complications of hypertension and may be used for initial drug therapy. There has been concern that diuretics, by adversely affecting the serum lipid profile or impairing glucose tolerance, may add to the risk of coronary disease, thereby offsetting the benefit of blood pressure reduction. However a recent large clinical trial comparing different classes of antihypertensive mediations for initial therapy found that chlorthalidone (a thiazide diuretic) was as effective as other agents in reducing coronary heart disease death and nonfatal myocardial infarction, and was superior to amlodipine in preventing heart failure and superior to lisinopril in preventing stroke.

The presence of concomitant disease should influence selection of antihypertensive drugs because two diseases may benefit from a single drug. For example, ACE inhibitors are particularly useful in patients with evidence of chronic kidney disease. Beta blockers or calcium channel blockers are useful in patients who also have angina; diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotension receptor blockers, or Bblockers in patients who also have heart failure; and $Q_{1}$ blockers in men who have benign prostatic hyperplasia. Race may also affect drug selection: African-Americans respond better to diuretics and calcium channel blockers than to Bblockers and ACE inhibitors. Chinese are more sensitive to the effects of Bblockers and may require lower doses.

If a single drug does not adequately control blood pressure, drugs with different sites of action can be combined to effectively lower blood pressure while minimizing toxicity ("stepped care"). If a diuretic is not used initially, it is often selected as the second drug. If three drugs are required, combining a diuretic, a sympathoplegic agent or an ACE inhibitor, and a direct vasodilator (eg, hydralazine or a calcium channel blocker) is often effective. In the USA, fixed-dose drug combinations containing a Bblocker, an ACE inhibitor, or an angiotensin receptor blocker plus a thiazide, and a calcium channel blocker plus an ACE inhibitor are available. Fixed-dose combinations have the drawback of not allowing for titration of individual drug doses but
have the advantage of allowing fewer pills to be taken, potentially enhancing compliance.
Assessment of blood pressure during office visits should include measurement of recumbent, sitting, and standing pressures. An attempt should be made to normalize blood pressure in the posture or activity level that is customary for the patient. The recent large Hypertension Optimal Treatment study suggests that the optimal blood pressure end point is $138 / 83 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Lowering blood pressure below this level produces no further benefit. In diabetic patients, however, there is a continued reduction of event rates with progressively lower blood pressures. Systolic hypertension ( $>140 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ in the presence of normal diastolic blood pressure) is a strong cardiovascular risk factor in people older than 50 years of age and should be treated. In addition to noncompliance with medication, causes of failure to respond to drug therapy include excessive sodium intake and inadequate diuretic therapy with excessive blood volume (this can be measured directly), and drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, over-the-counter sympathomimetics, abuse of stimulants (amphetamine or cocaine), or excessive doses of caffeine and oral contraceptives that can interfere with actions of some antihypertensive drugs or directly raise blood pressure.

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCIES}

Despite the large number of patients with chronic hypertension, hypertensive emergencies are relatively rare. Marked or sudden elevation of blood pressure may be a serious threat to life, however, and prompt control of blood pressure is indicated. Most commonly, hypertensive emergencies occur in patients whose hypertension is severe and poorly controlled and in those who suddenly discontinue antihypertensive medications.

\section*{Clinical Presentation \& Pathophysiology}

Hypertensive emergencies include hypertension associated with vascular damage (termed malignant hypertension) and hypertension associated with hemodynamic complications such as heart failure, stroke, or dissecting aneurysm. The underlying pathologic process in malignant hypertension is a progressive arteriopathy with inflammation and necrosis of arterioles. Vascular lesions occur in the kidney, which releases renin, which in turn stimulates production of angiotensin and aldosterone, which further increase blood pressure.

Hypertensive encephalopathy is a classic feature of malignant hypertension. Its clinical presentation consists of severe headache, mental confusion, and apprehension. Blurred vision, nausea and vomiting, and focal neurologic deficits are common. If untreated, the syndrome may progress over a period of 12-48 hours to convulsions, stupor, coma, and even death.

\section*{Treatment of Hypertensive Emergencies}

The general management of hypertensive emergencies requires monitoring the patient in an intensive care unit with continuous recording of arterial blood pressure. Fluid intake and output must be monitored carefully and body weight measured daily as an indicator of total body fluid volume during the course of therapy.

Parenteral antihypertensive medications are used to lower blood pressure rapidly (within a few hours); as soon as reasonable blood pressure control is achieved, oral antihypertensive therapy should be substituted, because this allows smoother long-term management of hypertension. The goal of treatment in the first few hours or days is not complete normalization of blood pressure because chronic hypertension is associated with autoregulatory changes in cerebral blood flow. Thus, rapid normalization of blood pressure may lead to cerebral hypoperfusion and brain injury. Rather, blood pressure should be lowered by about $25 \%$, maintaining diastolic blood pressure at no less than $100-110 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Subsequently, blood pressure can be reduced to
normal levels using oral medications over several weeks. The drug most commonly used to treat hypertensive emergencies is the vasodilator sodium nitroprusside. Other parenteral drugs that may be effective include fenoldopam, nitroglycerin, labetalol, calcium channel blockers, diazoxide, and hydralazine. Esmolol is often used to manage intraoperative and postoperative hypertension. Diuretics such as furosemide are administered to prevent the volume expansion that typically occurs during administration of powerful vasodilators.

\section*{VASODILATORS \& THE TREATMENT OF ANGI NA PECTORI S: I NTRODUCTION}

Angina pectoris is the most common condition involving tissue ischemia in which vasodilator drugs are used. The name denotes chest pain caused by accumulation of metabolites resulting from myocardial ischemia. The organic nitrates, eg, nitroglycerin, are the mainstay of therapy for the immediate relief of angina. Another group of vasodilators, the calcium channel blockers, is also important, especially for prophylaxis, and the Bblockers, which are not vasodilators, are also useful in prophylaxis. New groups of drugs under investigation include fatty acid oxidation inhibitors and selective cardiac rate inhibitors.

Ischemic heart disease is the most common serious health problem in many Western societies. By far the most frequent cause of angina is atheromatous obstruction of the large coronary vessels (atherosclerotic angina, classic angina). However, transient spasm of localized portions of these vessels, which is usually associated with underlying atheromas, can also cause significant myocardial ischemia and pain (vasospastic or variant angina).

The primary cause of angina pectoris is an imbalance between the oxygen requirement of the heart and the oxygen supplied to it via the coronary vessels. In classic angina, the imbalance occurs when the myocardial oxygen requirement increases, as during exercise, and coronary blood flow does not increase proportionately. The resulting ischemia usually leads to pain. Classic angina is therefore "angina of effort." (In some individuals, the ischemia is not always accompanied by pain, resulting in "silent" or "ambulatory" ischemia.) In variant angina, oxygen delivery decreases as a result of reversible coronary vasospasm. Variant angina is also called Prinzmetal's angina.

In theory, the imbalance between oxygen delivery and myocardial oxygen demand can be corrected by decreasing oxygen demand or by increasing delivery (by increasing coronary flow). In effort angina, oxygen demand can be reduced by decreasing cardiac work or, according to recent studies, by shifting myocardial metabolism to substrates that require less oxygen per unit of ATP produced. In variant angina, on the other hand, spasm of coronary vessels can be reversed by nitrates or calcium channel blockers. Lipid-lowering drugs, especially the "statins," have become extremely important in the long-term treatment of atherosclerotic disease (see Chapter 35).

Unstable angina, an acute coronary syndrome, is said to be present when there are episodes of angina at rest and when there is a change in the character, frequency, and duration of chest pain as well as precipitating factors in patients with previously stable angina. Unstable angina is caused by episodes of increased epicardial coronary artery tone or small platelet clots occurring in the vicinity of an atherosclerotic plaque. In most cases, formation of labile nonocclusive thrombi at the site of a fissured or ulcerated plaque is the mechanism for reduction in flow. The course and the prognosis of unstable angina are variable, but this subset of acute coronary syndrome is associated with a high risk of myocardial infarction and death.
Pathophysiology of Angina
Determinants of Myocardial Oxygen Demand

The major determinants of myocardial oxygen requirement are set forth in Table 12-1. As a consequence of its continuous activity, the heart's oxygen needs are relatively high, and it extracts approximately $75 \%$ of the available oxygen even in the absence of stress. The myocardial oxygen requirement increases when there is an increase in heart rate, contractility, arterial pressure, or ventricular volume. These hemodynamic alterations frequently occur during physical exercise and sympathetic discharge, which often precipitate angina in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease.
\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline Table 12-1. Determinants of Myocardial Oxygen Consumption. \\
\hline Wall stress \\
\hline Intraventricular pressure \\
\hline Ventricular radius (volume) \\
\hline Wall thickness \\
\hline Heart rate \\
\hline Contractility \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The heart favors fatty acids as a substrate for energy production. However, oxidation of fatty acids requires more oxygen per unit of ATP generated than oxidation of carbohydrates. Therefore, drugs that shift myocardial metabolism toward greater use of glucose (fatty acid oxidation inhibitors) have the potential of reducing the oxygen demand without altering hemodynamics.

\section*{Determinants of Coronary Blood Flow \& Myocardial Oxygen Supply}

Increased myocardial demands for oxygen in the normal heart are met by augmenting coronary blood flow. Coronary blood flow is directly related to the perfusion pressure (aortic diastolic pressure) and the duration of diastole. Because coronary flow drops to negligible values during systole, the duration of diastole becomes a limiting factor for myocardial perfusion during tachycardia. Coronary blood flow is inversely proportional to coronary vascular bed resistance. Resistance is determined mainly by intrinsic factors-including metabolic products and autonomic activity-and by various pharmacologic agents. Damage to the endothelium of coronary vessels has been shown to alter their ability to dilate and to increase coronary vascular resistance.

\section*{Determinants of Vascular Tone}

Arteriolar and venous tone (smooth muscle tension) both play a role in determining myocardial wall stress (Table 12-1). Arteriolar tone directly controls peripheral vascular resistance and thus arterial blood pressure. In systole, intraventricular pressure must exceed aortic pressure to eject blood; arterial blood pressure thus determines the systolic wall stress in an important way. Venous tone determines the capacity of the venous circulation and controls the amount of blood sequestered in the venous system versus the amount returned to the heart. Venous tone thereby determines the diastolic wall stress.

The regulation of smooth muscle contraction and relaxation is shown schematically in Figure 12-1. As shown in Figures 12-1 and 12-2, drugs may relax vascular smooth muscle in several ways:
(1) Increasing cGMP: As indicated in Figure 12-2, cGMP facilitates the dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, preventing the interaction of myosin with actin. Nitric oxide is an effective activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase and acts mainly through this mechanism. Important molecular donors of nitric oxide include nitroprusside (see Chapter 11) and the organic nitrates used in angina.
(2) Decreasing intracellular $\mathbf{C a}^{\mathbf{2 +}}$ : Calcium channel blockers predictably cause vasodilation because they reduce intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, a major modulator of the activation of myosin light chain kinase. (Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers reduce $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx in cardiac muscle, thereby reducing rate, contractility, and oxygen requirement unless reversed by compensatory responses.)
(3) Stabilizing or preventing depolarization of the vascular smooth muscle cell membrane: The membrane potential of excitable cells is stabilized near the resting potential by increasing potassium permeability. Potassium channel openers, such as minoxidil sulfate, (see Chapter 11) increase the permeability of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, probably ATP-dependent $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. Certain newer agents under investigation for use in angina (eg, nicorandil) may act, in part, by this mechanism.
(4) Increasing cAMP in vascular smooth muscle cells: As shown in Figure 12-1, an increase in cAMP increases the rate of inactivation of myosin light chain kinase, the enzyme responsible for triggering the interaction of actin with myosin in these cells. This appears to be the mechanism of vasodilation caused by $B_{2}$ agonists, drugs that are not used in angina.

Figure 12-1.

Control of smooth muscle contraction and site of action of calcium channel-blocking drugs. Contraction is triggered by influx of calcium (which can be blocked by calcium channel blockers) through transmembrane calcium channels. The calcium combines with calmodulin to form a complex that converts the enzyme myosin light chain kinase to its active form (MLCK*). The latter phosphorylates the myosin light chains, thereby initiating the interaction of myosin with actin. Beta ${ }_{2}$ agonists (and other substances that increase cAMP) may cause relaxation in smooth muscle by accelerating the inactivation of MLCK (heavy arrows) and by facilitating the expulsion of calcium from the cell (not shown).

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF DRUGS USED TO TREAT ANGI NA}

\section*{Drug Action in Angina}

Three of the four drug groups currently approved for use in angina (organic nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and Bblockers) decrease myocardial oxygen requirement by decreasing the determinants of oxygen demand (heart rate, ventricular volume, blood pressure, and contractility). In some patients, a redistribution of coronary flow may increase oxygen delivery to ischemic tissue. In variant angina, the nitrates and the calcium channel blockers may also increase myocardial oxygen delivery by reversing coronary arterial spasm. The fourth group, represented by ranolazine, is discussed later.

\section*{NITRATES \& NITRITES}

\section*{Chemistry}

These agents are simple nitric and nitrous acid esters of polyalcohols. Nitroglycerin may be considered the prototype of the group. Although nitroglycerin is used in the manufacture of dynamite, the formulations used in medicine are not explosive. The conventional sublingual tablet form of nitroglycerin may lose potency when stored as a result of volatilization and adsorption to plastic surfaces. Therefore, it should be kept in tightly closed glass containers. It is not sensitive to light.

All therapeutically active agents in the nitrate group have identical mechanisms of action and similar toxicities. Therefore, pharmacokinetic factors govern the choice of agent and mode of therapy when
using the nitrates.

Nitroglycerin
(glyceryl trinitrate)

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

The liver contains a high-capacity organic nitrate reductase that removes nitrate groups in a stepwise fashion from the parent molecule and ultimately inactivates the drug. Therefore, oral bioavailability of the traditional organic nitrates (eg, nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate) is very low (typically < $10-20 \%)$. For this reason, the sublingual route, which avoids the first-pass effect, is preferred for achieving a therapeutic blood level rapidly. Nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate are both absorbed efficiently by this route and reach therapeutic blood levels within a few minutes. However, the total dose administered by this route must be limited to avoid excessive effect; therefore, the total duration of effect is brief (15-30 minutes). When much longer duration of action is needed, oral preparations can be given that contain an amount of drug sufficient to result in sustained systemic blood levels of the parent drug plus active metabolites. Other routes of administration available for nitroglycerin include transdermal and buccal absorption from slow-release preparations; these are described below.

Amyl nitrite and related nitrites are highly volatile liquids. Amyl nitrite is available in fragile glass ampules packaged in a protective cloth covering. The ampule can be crushed with the fingers, resulting in rapid release of inhalable vapors through the cloth covering. The inhalation route provides very rapid absorption and, like the sublingual route, avoids the hepatic first-pass effect. Because of its unpleasant odor and short duration of action, amyl nitrite is now obsolete for angina.

Once absorbed, the unchanged nitrate compounds have half-lives of only 2-8 minutes. The partially denitrated metabolites have much longer half-lives (up to 3 hours). Of the nitroglycerin metabolites (two dinitroglycerins and two mononitro forms), the dinitro derivatives have significant vasodilator efficacy; they probably provide most of the therapeutic effect of orally administered nitroglycerin. The 5-mononitrate metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate is an active metabolite of the latter drug and is available for clinical use as isosorbide mononitrate. It has a bioavailability of $100 \%$.

Excretion, primarily in the form of glucuronide derivatives of the denitrated metabolites, is largely by way of the kidney.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

\section*{MECHANISM OF ACTION IN SMOOTH MUSCLE}

Nitroglycerin is denitrated by glutathione S-transferase. Free nitrite ion is released, which is then converted to nitric oxide (see Chapter 19). A different unknown enzymatic reaction releases nitric oxide directly from the parent drug molecule. As shown in Figure 12-2, nitric oxide (or an Snitrosothiol derivative) causes activation of guanylyl cyclase and an increase in cGMP, which are the first steps toward smooth muscle relaxation. The production of prostaglandin E or prostacyclin ( PGI $_{2}$ ) and membrane hyperpolarization may also be involved. There is no evidence that autonomic receptors
are involved in the primary nitrate response (although autonomic reflex responses are evoked when hypotensive doses are given).

As described below, tolerance is an important consideration in the use of nitrates. While tolerance may be caused in part by a decrease in tissue sulfhydryl groups, it can be only partially prevented or reversed with a sulfhydryl-regenerating agent. Increased generation of oxygen free radicals during nitrate therapy may be another important mechanism of tolerance.

Nicorandil and several other investigational antianginal agents appear to combine the activity of nitric oxide release with potassium channel-opening action, thus providing an additional mechanism for causing vasodilation.

\section*{ORGAN SYSTEM EFFECTS}

Nitroglycerin relaxes all types of smooth muscle irrespective of the cause of the preexisting muscle tone (Figure 12-3). It has practically no direct effect on cardiac or skeletal muscle.

Figure 12-3.

Effects of vasodilators on contractions of human vein segments studied in vitro. Panel A shows contractions induced by two vasoconstrictor agents, norepinephrine (NE) and potassium (K+). Panel B shows the relaxation induced by nitroglycerin (NTG), $4 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$. The relaxation is prompt. Panel C shows the relaxation induced by verapamil, $2.2 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$. The relaxation is slower but more sustained. (Modified and reproduced, with permission, from Mikkelsen E, Andersson KE, Bengtsson B: Effects of verapamil and nitroglycerin on contractile responses to potassium and noradrenaline in isolated human peripheral veins. Acta Pharmacol Toxicol 1978; 42: 14.)

\section*{Vascular Smooth Muscle}

All segments of the vascular system from large arteries through large veins relax in response to nitroglycerin. Veins respond at the lowest concentrations, arteries at slightly higher ones. Arterioles
and precapillary sphincters are dilated less than the large arteries and the veins, partly because of reflex responses and partly because different vessels vary in their ability to release nitric oxide. The primary direct result of an effective dose of nitroglycerin is marked relaxation of veins with increased venous capacitance and decreased ventricular preload. Pulmonary vascular pressures and heart size are significantly reduced. In the absence of heart failure, cardiac output is reduced. Because venous capacitance is increased, orthostatic hypotension may be marked and syncope can result. Dilation of some large arteries (including the aorta) may be significant because of their large increase in compliance. Temporal artery pulsations and a throbbing headache associated with meningeal artery pulsations are frequent effects of nitroglycerin and amyl nitrite. In heart failure, preload is often abnormally high; the nitrates and other vasodilators, by reducing preload, may have a beneficial effect on cardiac output in this condition (see Chapter 13).

The indirect effects of nitroglycerin consist of those compensatory responses evoked by baroreceptors and hormonal mechanisms responding to decreased arterial pressure (see Figure 6-7); this consistently results in tachycardia and increased cardiac contractility. Retention of salt and water may also be significant, especially with intermediate- and long-acting nitrates. These compensatory responses contribute to the development of tolerance.

In normal subjects without coronary disease, nitroglycerin can induce a significant, if transient, increase in total coronary blood flow. In contrast, there is no evidence that total coronary flow is increased in patients with angina due to atherosclerotic obstructive coronary artery disease. However, some studies suggest that redistribution of coronary flow from normal to ischemic regions may play a role in nitroglycerin's therapeutic effect. Nitroglycerin also exerts a weak negative inotropic effect via nitric oxide.

\section*{Other Smooth Muscle Organs}

Relaxation of smooth muscle of the bronchi, gastrointestinal tract (including biliary system), and genitourinary tract has been demonstrated experimentally. Because of their brief duration, these actions of the nitrates are rarely of any clinical value. During recent years, the use of amyl nitrite and isobutyl nitrite by inhalation as purported recreational (sex-enhancing) drugs has become popular with some segments of the population. Nitrites release nitric oxide in erectile tissue as well as vascular smooth muscle and activate guanylyl cyclase. The resulting increase in cGMP causes dephosphorylation of myosin light chains and relaxation (Figure 12-2), which enhances erection. Drugs used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction are discussed in Drugs Used in the Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction.

\section*{Action on Platelets}

Nitric oxide released from nitroglycerin stimulates guanylyl cyclase in platelets as in smooth muscle. The increase in cGMP that results is responsible for a decrease in platelet aggregation. Unfortunately, recent prospective trials have established no survival benefit when nitroglycerin is used in acute myocardial infarction.

\section*{Other Effects}

Nitrite ion reacts with hemoglobin (which contains ferrous iron) to produce methemoglobin (which contains ferric iron). Because methemoglobin has a very low affinity for oxygen, large doses of nitrites can result in pseudocyanosis, tissue hypoxia, and death. Fortunately, the plasma level of nitrite resulting from even large doses of organic and inorganic nitrates is too low to cause significant methemoglobinemia in adults. However, sodium nitrite is used as a curing agent for meats. In nursing
infants, the intestinal flora is capable of converting significant amounts of inorganic nitrate, eg, from well water, to nitrite ion. Thus, inadvertent exposure to large amounts of nitrite ion can occur and may produce serious toxicity.

One therapeutic application of this otherwise toxic effect of nitrite has been discovered. Cyanide poisoning results from complexing of cytochrome iron by the $\mathrm{CN}^{-}$ion. Methemoglobin iron has a very high affinity for $\mathrm{CN}^{-}$; thus, administration of sodium nitrite ( $\mathrm{NaNO}_{2}$ ) soon after cyanide exposure will regenerate active cytochrome. The cyanmethemoglobin produced can be further detoxified by the intravenous administration of sodium thiosulfate ( $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ ); this results in formation of thiocyanate ion $\left(\mathrm{SCN}^{-}\right)$, a less toxic ion that is readily excreted. Methemoglobinemia, if excessive, can be treated by giving methylene blue intravenously.

\section*{Drugs Used in the Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction}

Erectile dysfunction in men has long been the subject of research (by both amateur and professional scientists). Among the substances used in the past and generally discredited are "Spanish Fly" (a bladder and urethral irritant), yohimbine (an $\alpha_{2}$ antagonist; see Chapter 10), nutmeg, and mixtures containing lead, arsenic, or strychnine. Substances currently favored by practitioners of herbal medicine include ginseng and kava.

Scientific studies of the process have shown that erection requires relaxation of the nonvascular smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa. This relaxation permits inflow of blood at nearly arterial pressure into the sinuses of the cavernosa, and it is the pressure of the blood that causes erection. Physiologic erection occurs in response to the release of nitric oxide from nonadrenergic-noncholinergic nerves (see Chapter 6) associated with parasympathetic discharge. Thus, parasympathetic innervation must be intact and nitric oxide synthesis must be active. (It appears that a similar process occurs in female erectile tissues.) Certain other smooth muscle relaxants-eg, $\mathrm{PGE}_{1}$ analogs or cantagonists-if present in high enough concentration, can independently cause sufficient cavernosal relaxation to result in erection. As noted in the text, nitric oxide activates guanylyl cyclase, which increases the concentration of cGMP, and the latter messenger stimulates the dephosphorylation of myosin light chains (see Figure 12-2) and relaxation of the smooth muscle. Thus, any drug that increases cGMP might be of value in erectile dysfunction if normal innervation is present. Sildenafil (Viagra) acts to increase cGMP by inhibiting its breakdown by phosphodiesterase isoform 5. The drug has been very successful in the marketplace because it can be taken orally. However, sildenafil is of little or no value in men with loss of potency due to cord injury or other damage to innervation and in men lacking libido. Furthermore, sildenafil potentiates the action of nitrates used for angina, and severe hypotension and a few myocardial infarctions have been reported in men taking both drugs. It is recommended that at least 6 hours pass between use of a nitrate and the ingestion of sildenafil. Sildenafil also has effects on color vision, causing difficulty in blue-green discrimination. Two similar PDE-5 inhibitors, tadalafil and vardenafil, are available.

The drug most commonly used in patients who do not respond to sildenafil is alprostadil, a $\mathrm{PGE}_{1}$ analog (see Chapter 18) that can be injected directly into the cavernosa or placed in the urethra as a minisuppository, from which it diffuses into the cavernosal tissue. Phentolamine can be used by injection into the cavernosa. These drugs will cause erection in most men who do not respond to sildenafil.

\section*{Toxicity \& Tolerance}

\section*{ACUTE ADVERSE EFFECTS}

The major acute toxicities of organic nitrates are direct extensions of therapeutic vasodilation: orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, and throbbing headache. Glaucoma, once thought to be a contraindication, does not worsen, and nitrates can be used safely in the presence of increased intraocular pressure. Nitrates are contraindicated, however, if intracranial pressure is elevated.

\section*{TOLERANCE}

With continuous exposure to nitrates, isolated smooth muscle may develop complete tolerance (tachyphylaxis), and the intact human becomes progressively more tolerant when long-acting preparations (oral, transdermal) or continuous intravenous infusions are used for more than a few hours without interruption.

Continuous exposure to high levels of nitrates can occur in the chemical industry, especially where explosives are manufactured. When contamination of the workplace with volatile organic nitrate compounds is severe, workers find that upon starting their work week (Monday), they suffer headache and transient dizziness. After a day or so, these symptoms disappear owing to the development of tolerance. Over the weekend, when exposure to the chemicals is reduced, tolerance disappears, so symptoms recur each Monday. Other hazards of industrial exposure, including dependence, have been reported. There is no evidence that physical dependence develops as a result of the therapeutic use of short-acting nitrates for angina, even in large doses.

The mechanisms by which tolerance develops are not completely understood. As noted above, diminished release of nitric oxide resulting from depletion of tissue thiol compounds may be partly responsible for tolerance to nitroglycerin. Systemic compensation also plays a role in tolerance in the intact human. Initially, significant sympathetic discharge occurs and after one or more days of therapy with long-acting nitrates, retention of salt and water may reverse the favorable hemodynamic changes normally caused by nitroglycerin.

\section*{CARCI NOGENI CITY OF NITRATE AND NITRATE DERIVATIVES}

Nitrosamines are small molecules with the structure $\mathrm{R}_{2}-\mathrm{N}-\mathrm{NO}$ formed from the combination of nitrates and nitrites with amines. Some nitrosamines are powerful carcinogens in animals, apparently through conversion to reactive derivatives. While there is no direct proof that these agents cause cancer in humans, there is a strong epidemiologic correlation between the incidence of esophageal and gastric carcinoma and the nitrate content of food in different cultures. Nitrosamines are also found in tobacco and in cigarette smoke. There is no evidence that the small doses of nitrates used in the treatment of angina result in significant body levels of nitrosamines.

\section*{Mechanisms of Clinical Effect}

The beneficial and deleterious effects of nitrate-induced vasodilation are summarized in Table 12-2.

\section*{NITRATE EFFECTS IN ANGI NA OF EFFORT}

Decreased venous return to the heart and the resulting reduction of intracardiac volume are the principal hemodynamic effects. Arterial pressure also decreases. Decreased intraventricular pressure and left ventricular volume are associated with decreased wall tension (Laplace relation) and decreased myocardial oxygen requirement. In rare instances, a paradoxical increase in myocardial oxygen demand may occur as a result of excessive reflex tachycardia and increased contractility.

Intracoronary, intravenous, or sublingual nitrate administration consistently increases the caliber of the large epicardial coronary arteries. Coronary arteriolar resistance tends to decrease, although to a lesser extent. However, nitrates administered by the usual systemic routes also consistently decrease overall coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption. The reduction in oxygen consumption is the major mechanism for the relief of effort angina.

\section*{NITRATE EFFECTS IN VARIANT ANGINA}

Nitrates benefit patients with variant angina by relaxing the smooth muscle of the epicardial coronary arteries and relieving coronary artery spasm.

\section*{NITRATE EFFECTS IN UNSTABLE ANGINA}

Nitrates are also useful in the treatment of this acute coronary syndrome, but the precise mechanism for their beneficial effects is not clear. Because both increased coronary vascular tone and increased
myocardial oxygen demand can precipitate rest angina in these patients, nitrates may exert their beneficial effects both by dilating the epicardial coronary arteries and by simultaneously reducing myocardial oxygen demand. As noted above, nitroglycerin also decreases platelet aggregation, and this effect may be of importance in unstable angina.

\section*{Clinical Use of Nitrates}

Some of the forms of nitroglycerin and its congeners are listed in Table 12-3. Because of its rapid onset of action (1-3 minutes), sublingual nitroglycerin is the most frequently used agent for the immediate treatment of angina. Because its duration of action is short (not exceeding 20-30 minutes), it is not suitable for maintenance therapy. The onset of action of intravenous nitroglycerin is also rapid (minutes), but its hemodynamic effects are quickly reversed by stopping its infusion. Clinical application of intravenous nitroglycerin, therefore, is restricted to the treatment of severe, recurrent rest angina. Slowly absorbed preparations of nitroglycerin include a buccal form, oral preparations, and several transdermal forms. These formulations have been shown to provide blood concentrations for long periods but, as noted above, this leads to the development of tolerance.

Table 12-3. Nitrate and Nitrite Drugs Used in the Treatment of Angina.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Drug & Dose & Duration of Action \\
\hline "Short-acting" & & \\
\hline Nitroglycerin, sublingual & $0.15-1.2 \mathrm{mg}$ & 10-30 minutes \\
\hline Isosorbide dinitrate, sublingual & $2.5-5 \mathrm{mg}$ & 10-60 minutes \\
\hline Amyl nitrite, inhalant & $0.18-0.3 \mathrm{~mL}$ & 3-5 minutes \\
\hline "Long-acting" & & \\
\hline Nitroglycerin, oral sustained-action & $6.5-13 \mathrm{mg}$ per 6-8 hours & 6-8 hours \\
\hline Nitroglycerin, 2\% ointment, transdermal & 1-1.5 inches per 4 hours & 3-6 hours \\
\hline Nitroglycerin, slow-release, buccal & 1-2 mg per 4 hours & 3-6 hours \\
\hline Nitroglycerin, slow-release patch, transdermal & 10-25 mg per 24 hours (one patch per day) & 8-10 hours \\
\hline Isosorbide dinitrate, sublingual & $2.5-10 \mathrm{mg}$ per 2 hours & 1.5-2 hours \\
\hline Isosorbide dinitrate, oral & $10-60 \mathrm{mg}$ per 4-6 hours & 4-6 hours \\
\hline Isosorbide dinitrate, chewable oral & $5-10 \mathrm{mg}$ per $2-4$ hours & 2-3 hours \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Drug & Dose & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Duration of \\
Action
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Isosorbide mononitrate, oral & 20 mg per 12 hours & $6-10$ hours \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The hemodynamic effects of sublingual or chewable isosorbide dinitrate and other organic nitrates are similar to those of nitroglycerin. The recommended dosage schedules for commonly used long-acting nitrate preparations, along with their durations of action, are listed in Table 12-3. Although transdermal administration may provide blood levels of nitroglycerin for 24 hours or longer, the full hemodynamic effects usually do not persist for more than $6-8$ hours. The clinical efficacy of slowrelease forms of nitroglycerin in maintenance therapy of angina is thus limited by the development of significant tolerance. Therefore, a nitrate-free period of at least 8 hours between doses should be observed to reduce or prevent tolerance.

\section*{OTHER NITRO-VASODILATORS}

Nicorandil is a nicotinamide nitrate ester that has vasodilating properties in normal coronary arteries but more complex effects in patients with angina. Clinical studies suggest that it reduces both preload and afterload. It also provides some myocardial protection via preconditioning by activation of cardiac $\mathrm{K}_{\text {ATP }}$ channels. One large trial showed a significant reduction in relative risk of fatal and nonfatal coronary events in patients receiving the drug. Nicorandil is currently approved for use in the treatment of angina in Europe and Japan and has been submitted for approval in the USA.

\section*{CALCI UM CHANNEL-BLOCKI NG DRUGS}

It has been known since the late 1800s that calcium influx was necessary for the contraction of smooth and cardiac muscle. The discovery of a calcium channel in cardiac muscle was followed by the finding of several different types of calcium channels in different tissues (Table 12-4). The discovery of these channels made possible the development of clinically useful blocking drugs. Although the successful therapeutic blockers developed to date have been exclusively L-type channel blockers, selective blockers of other types of calcium channels are under intensive investigation.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Verapamil, the first clinically useful member of this group, was the result of attempts to synthesize more active analogs of papaverine, a vasodilator alkaloid found in the opium poppy. Since then, dozens of agents of varying structure have been found to have the same fundamental pharmacologic action (Table 12-5). Three chemically dissimilar calcium channel blockers are shown in Figure 12-4. Nifedipine is the prototype of the dihydropyridine family of calcium channel blockers; dozens of molecules in this family have been investigated, and seven are currently approved in the USA for angina and other indications. Nifedipine is the most extensively studied of this group, but the properties of the other dihydropyridines can be assumed to be similar to it unless otherwise noted.

Chemical structures of several calcium channel-blocking drugs.
The calcium channel blockers are orally active agents and are characterized by high first-pass effect, high plasma protein binding, and extensive metabolism. Verapamil and diltiazem are also used by the intravenous route.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

\section*{MECHANISM OF ACTION}

The L-type calcium channel is the dominant type in cardiac and smooth muscle and is known to contain several drug receptors. It has been demonstrated that nifedipine and other dihydropyridines bind to one site, while verapamil and diltiazem appear to bind to closely related but not identical receptors in another region. Binding of a drug to the verapamil or diltiazem receptors also affects dihydropyridine binding. These receptor regions are stereoselective, since marked differences in both stereoisomerbinding affinity and pharmacologic potency are observed for enantiomers of verapamil, diltiazem, and optically active nifedipine congeners.

Blockade by these drugs resembles that of sodium channel blockade by local anesthetics (see Chapters 14 and 26). The drugs act from the inner side of the membrane and bind more effectively to channels in depolarized membranes. Binding of the drug reduces the frequency of opening in response to depolarization. The result is a marked decrease in transmembrane calcium current, resulting in smooth muscle with a long-lasting relaxation (Figure 12-3), and in cardiac muscle with a reduction in
contractility throughout the heart and decreases in sinus node pacemaker rate and in atrioventricular node conduction velocity.*

Smooth muscle responses to calcium influx through receptor-operated calcium channels are also reduced by these drugs but not as markedly. The block can be partially reversed by elevating the concentration of calcium, although the levels of calcium required are not easily attainable. Block can also be partially reversed by the use of drugs that increase the transmembrane flux of calcium, such as sympathomimetics.

Other types of calcium channels are less sensitive to blockade by these calcium channel blockers (Table 12-4). Therefore, tissues in which these other channel types play a major role-neurons and most secretory glands-are much less affected by these drugs than are cardiac and smooth muscle.
*At very low doses and under certain circumstances, some dihydropyridines increase calcium influx. Some special dihydropyridines, eg, Bay K 8644, actually increase calcium influx over most of their dose range.

\section*{ORGAN SYSTEM EFFECTS}

\section*{Smooth Muscle}

Most types of smooth muscle are dependent on transmembrane calcium influx for normal resting tone and contractile responses. These cells are relaxed by the calcium channel blockers (Figure 12-3). Vascular smooth muscle appears to be the most sensitive, but similar relaxation can be shown for bronchiolar, gastrointestinal, and uterine smooth muscle. In the vascular system, arterioles appear to be more sensitive than veins; orthostatic hypotension is not a common adverse effect. Blood pressure is reduced with all calcium channel blockers. Women may be more sensitive than men to the hypotensive action of diltiazem. The reduction in peripheral vascular resistance is one mechanism by which these agents may benefit the patient with angina of effort. Reduction of coronary arterial tone has been demonstrated in patients with variant angina.

Important differences in vascular selectivity exist among the calcium channel blockers. In general, the dihydropyridines have a greater ratio of vascular smooth muscle effects relative to cardiac effects than do diltiazem and verapamil. Furthermore, the dihydropyridines may differ in their potency in different vascular beds. For example, nimodipine is claimed to be particularly selective for cerebral blood vessels.

\section*{Cardiac Muscle}

Cardiac muscle is highly dependent upon calcium influx for normal function. I mpulse generation in the sinoatrial node and conduction in the atrioventricular node-so-called slow response, or calciumdependent, action potentials-may be reduced or blocked by all of the calcium channel blockers. Excitation-contraction coupling in all cardiac cells requires calcium influx, so these drugs reduce cardiac contractility in a dose-dependent fashion. In some cases, cardiac output may also decrease. This reduction in cardiac mechanical function is another mechanism by which the calcium channel blockers can reduce the oxygen requirement in patients with angina.

Important differences between the available calcium channel blockers arise from the details of their interactions with cardiac ion channels and, as noted above, differences in their relative smooth muscle versus cardiac effects. Sodium channel block is modest with verapamil and still less marked with diltiazem. It is negligible with nifedipine and other dihydropyridines. Verapamil and diltiazem interact
kinetically with the calcium channel receptor in a different manner than the dihydropyridines; they block tachycardias in calcium-dependent cells, eg, the atrioventricular node, more selectively than do the dihydropyridines. (See Chapter 14 for additional details.) On the other hand, the dihydropyridines appear to block smooth muscle calcium channels at concentrations below those required for significant cardiac effects; they are therefore less depressant on the heart than verapamil or diltiazem.

\section*{Skeletal Muscle}

Skeletal muscle is not depressed by the calcium channel blockers because it uses intracellular pools of calcium to support excitation-contraction coupling and does not require as much transmembrane calcium influx.

\section*{Cerebral Vasospasm and Infarct Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage}

Nimodipine, a member of the dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blockers, has a high affinity for cerebral blood vessels and appears to reduce morbidity following a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Nimodipine is therefore labeled for use in patients who have had a hemorrhagic stroke. Although evidence suggests that calcium channel blockers may also reduce cerebral damage following thromboembolic stroke in experimental animals, there is no evidence that this occurs in humans.

\section*{Other Effects}

Calcium channel blockers minimally interfere with stimulus-secretion coupling in glands and nerve endings because of differences between calcium channels in different tissues, as noted above. Verapamil has been shown to inhibit insulin release in humans, but the dosages required are greater than those used in management of angina.

A significant body of evidence suggests that the calcium channel blockers may interfere with platelet aggregation in vitro and prevent or attenuate the development of atheromatous lesions in animals. Clinical studies have not established their role in human blood clotting and atherosclerosis.

Verapamil has been shown to block the P-glycoprotein responsible for the transport of many foreign drugs out of cancer (and other) cells; other calcium channel blockers appear to have a similar effect. This action is not stereospecific. Verapamil has been shown to partially reverse the resistance of cancer cells to many chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro. Some clinical results suggest similar effects in patients (see Chapter 55).

\section*{Toxicity}

The most important toxic effects reported for the calcium channel blockers are direct extensions of their therapeutic action. Excessive inhibition of calcium influx can cause serious cardiac depression, including cardiac arrest, bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and heart failure. These effects have been rare in clinical use.

Retrospective case control studies reported that immediate-acting nifedipine increased the risk of myocardial infarction in patients with hypertension. Slow-release and long-acting vasoselective calcium channel blockers are usually well tolerated. However, dihydropyridines, compared with angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors, have been reported to increase the risk of adverse cardiac events in patients with hypertension with or without diabetes. These results suggest that relatively short-acting calcium channel blockers have the potential to enhance the risk of adverse cardiac events and should be avoided. Patients receiving B-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs are more sensitive to the cardiodepressant effects of calcium channel blockers. Minor toxicity (troublesome but not usually
requiring discontinuance of therapy) includes flushing, dizziness, nausea, constipation, and peripheral edema.

\section*{Mechanisms of Clinical Effects}

Calcium channel blockers decrease myocardial contractile force, which reduces myocardial oxygen requirements. Inhibition of calcium entry into arterial smooth muscle is associated with decreased arteriolar tone and systemic vascular resistance, resulting in decreased arterial and intraventricular pressure. Some of these drugs (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) also possess a nonspecific antiadrenergic effect, which may contribute to peripheral vasodilation. As a result of all of these effects, left ventricular wall stress declines, which reduces myocardial oxygen requirements. Decreased heart rate with the use of verapamil or diltiazem causes a further decrease in myocardial oxygen demand. Calcium channel-blocking agents also relieve and prevent the primary cause of variant angina-focal coronary artery spasm. Use of these agents has thus emerged as the most effective prophylactic treatment for this form of angina pectoris.

Sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal tissues, which are mainly composed of calcium-dependent, slow response cells, are affected markedly by verapamil, moderately by diltiazem, and much less by dihydropyridines. Thus, verapamil and diltiazem decrease atrioventricular nodal conduction and are effective in the management of supraventricular reentry tachycardia and in decreasing ventricular responses in atrial fibrillation or flutter. Nifedipine does not affect atrioventricular conduction. Nonspecific sympathetic antagonism is most marked with diltiazem and much less with verapamil. Nifedipine does not appear to have this effect. Thus, significant reflex tachycardia in response to hypotension occurs most frequently with nifedipine and less so with diltiazem and verapamil. These differences in pharmacologic effects should be considered in selecting calcium channel-blocking agents for the management of angina.

\section*{Clinical Uses of Calcium Channel- Blocking Drugs}

In addition to angina, calcium channel blockers have well-documented efficacy in hypertension (see Chapter 11) and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (see Chapter 14). They also show promise in a variety of other conditions, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, migraine, and Raynaud's phenomenon.

The pharmacokinetic properties of these drugs are set forth in Table 12-5. The choice of a particular calcium channel-blocking agent should be made with knowledge of its specific potential adverse effects as well as its pharmacologic properties. Nifedipine does not decrease atrioventricular conduction and therefore can be used more safely than verapamil or diltiazem in the presence of atrioventricular conduction abnormalities. A combination of verapamil or diltiazem with Bblockers may produce atrioventricular block and depression of ventricular function. In the presence of overt heart failure, all calcium channel blockers can cause further worsening of heart failure as a result of their negative inotropic effect. Amlodipine, however, does not increase the mortality of patients with heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction and can be used safely in these patients. In the presence of relatively low blood pressure, dihydropyridines can cause further deleterious lowering of pressure. Verapamil and diltiazem appear to produce less hypotension and may be better tolerated in these circumstances. In patients with a history of atrial tachycardia, flutter, and fibrillation, verapamil and diltiazem provide a distinct advantage because of their antiarrhythmic effects. In the patient receiving
digitalis, verapamil should be used with caution, because it may increase digoxin blood levels through a pharmacokinetic interaction. Although increases in digoxin blood level have also been demonstrated with diltiazem and nifedipine, such interactions are less consistent than with verapamil.

In patients with unstable angina, immediate-release short-acting calcium channel blockers can increase the risk of adverse cardiac events and therefore are contraindicated (see Toxicity, above). However, in patients with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, diltiazem can decrease the frequency of postinfarction angina and may be used.

\section*{BETA-ADRENORECEPTOR- BLOCKI NG DRUGS}

Although they are not vasodilators, B-blocking drugs (see Chapter 10) are extremely useful in the management of angina pectoris associated with effort. The beneficial effects of B-blocking agents are related primarily to their hemodynamic effects-decreased heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility-which decrease myocardial oxygen requirements at rest and during exercise. Lower heart rate is also associated with an increase in diastolic perfusion time that may increase coronary perfusion. However, reduction of heart rate and blood pressure and consequently decreased myocardial oxygen consumption appear to be the most important mechanisms for relief of angina and improved exercise tolerance. Beta blockers may also be valuable in treating silent or ambulatory ischemia. Because this condition causes no pain, it is usually detected by the appearance of typical electrocardiographic signs of ischemia. The total amount of "ischemic time" per day is reduced by longterm therapy with a Bblocker. Beta-blocking agents decrease mortality of patients with recent myocardial infarction and improve survival and prevent stroke in patients with hypertension. Randomized trials in patients with stable angina have shown better outcome and symptomatic improvement with Bblockers compared with calcium channel blockers.

Undesirable effects of B-blocking agents in angina include an increase in end-diastolic volume and an increase in ejection time. Increased myocardial oxygen requirements associated with increased diastolic volume partially offset the beneficial effects of B-blocking agents. These potentially deleterious effects of B-blocking agents can be balanced by the concomitant use of nitrates as described below.

The contraindications to the use of Bblockers are asthma and other bronchospastic conditions, severe bradycardia, atrioventricular blockade, bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, and severe unstable left ventricular failure. Potential complications include fatigue, impaired exercise tolerance, insomnia, unpleasant dreams, worsening of claudication, and erectile dysfunction.

\section*{NEWER ANTI ANGI NAL DRUGS}

Because of the high incidence of angina, new drugs are actively sought for its treatment. Some of the drugs or drug groups currently under investigation are listed in Table 12-6.
\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline Table 12-6. Drugs or Drug Groups under I nvestigation for Use in Angina. \\
\hline Metabolic modulators, eg, ranolazine \\
\hline Direct bradycardic agents, eg, ivabradine \\
\hline Potassium channel activators, eg, nicorandil \\
\hline Rho-kinase inhibitors, eg, fasudil \\
\hline Sulfonylureas, eg, glibenclamide \\
\hline Thiazolidinediones \\
\hline Vasopeptidase inhibitors \\
\hline Nitric oxide donors, eg, l-arginine \\
\hline Capsaicin \\
\hline Amiloride \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The metabolic modulators (eg, ranolazine, trimetazidine) are known as pFOX inhibitors because they partially inhibit the fatty acid oxidation pathway in myocardium. Because metabolism shifts to oxidation of fatty acids in ischemic myocardium, the oxygen requirement per unit of ATP produced increases. Partial inhibition of the enzyme required for fatty acid oxidation (long chain 3-ketoacyl thiolase, LC-3KAT) appears to improve the metabolic status of ischemic tissue. However, blockade of a late sodium current that facilitates calcium entry may play a larger role in the action of ranolazine.

So-called bradycardic drugs, relatively selective $I_{f}$ sodium channel blockers (eg, ivabradine), reduce cardiac rate by inhibiting the hyperpolarization-activated sodium channel in the sinoatrial node. No other significant hemodynamic effects have been reported. Ivabradine appears to reduce anginal attacks with an efficacy similar to that of calcium channel blockers and blockers.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF DRUGS USED TO TREAT ANGI NA}

Because the most common cause of angina is atheroclerotic disease of the coronaries (CAD), therapy must address the underlying causes of CAD as well as the immediate symptoms of angina. In addition to reducing the need for antianginal therapy, such primary management has been shown to reduce major cardiac events such as myocardial infarction.

First-line therapy of CAD depends on modification of risk factors such as smoking, hypertension (Chapter 11), hyperlipidemia (Chapter 35), obesity, and clinical depression. In addition, antiplatelet drugs (Chapter 34) are very important.

Specific pharmacologic therapy to prevent myocardial infarction and death consists of antiplatelet
agents (aspirin, clopidogrel) and lipid-lowering agents, especially statins. Aggressive therapy with statins has been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of ischemia in patients during exercise testing and the incidence of cardiac events (including infarction and death) in clinical trials. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors also reduce the risk of adverse cardiac events in patients at high risk for CAD although they have not been consistently shown to exert antianginal effects. In patients with unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, aggressive therapy consisting of coronary stenting, antilipid drugs, heparin, and antiplatelet agents is recommended.

The treatment of established angina and other manifestations of myocardial ischemia includes the corrective measures described above as well as treatment to prevent or relieve symptoms. Treatment of symptoms is based on reduction of myocardial oxygen demand and increase of coronary blood flow to the potentially ischemic myocardium to restore the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand.

\section*{Angina of Effort}

Many studies have demonstrated that nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and Bblockers increase time to onset of angina and ST depression during treadmill tests in patients with angina of effort (Figure 12-5). Although exercise tolerance increases, there is usually no change in the angina threshold, ie, the rate-pressure product at which symptoms occur.

Figure 12-5.

Effects of diltiazem on the double product (heart rate times systolic blood pressure) in a group of 20 patients with angina of effort. In a double-blind study using a standard protocol, patients were tested on a treadmill during treatment with placebo and three doses of the drug. Heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (BP) were recorded at 180 seconds of exercise (midpoints of lines) and at the time of onset of anginal symptoms (rightmost points). Note that the drug treatment decreased the double product at all times during exercise and prolonged the time to appearance of symptoms. (Data from Lindenberg BS et al: Efficacy and safety of incremental doses of diltiazem for the treatment of angina. J Am Coll Cardiol 1983; 2: 1129. Used with permission of the American College of Cardiology.)

For maintenance therapy of chronic stable angina, long-acting nitrates, calcium channel-blocking
agents, or Bblockers may be chosen; the best choice of drug will depend on the individual patient's response. In hypertensive patients, monotherapy with either slow-release or long-acting calcium channel blockers or Bblockers may be adequate. In normotensive patients, long-acting nitrates may be suitable. The combination of a Bblocker with a calcium channel blocker (eg, propranolol with nifedipine) or two different calcium channel blockers (eg, nifedipine and verapamil) has been shown to be more effective than individual drugs used alone. If response to a single drug is inadequate, a drug from a different class should be added to maximize the beneficial reduction of cardiac work while minimizing undesirable effects (Table 12-7). Some patients may require therapy with all three drug groups.

\section*{${ }^{1}$ Baroreceptor reflex.}

Surgical revascularization (ie, coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) and catheter-based revascularization (ie, percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) are the primary methods for promptly restoring coronary blood flow and increasing oxygen supply to the myocardium.

\section*{Vasospastic Angina}

Nitrates and the calcium channel blockers are effective drugs for relieving and preventing ischemic episodes in patients with variant angina. In approximately $70 \%$ of patients treated with nitrates plus calcium channel blockers, angina attacks are completely abolished; in another 20\%, marked reduction of frequency of anginal episodes is observed. Prevention of coronary artery spasm (in the presence or absence of fixed atherosclerotic coronary artery lesions) is the principal mechanism for this beneficial response. All presently available calcium channel blockers appear to be equally effective, and the choice of a particular drug should depend on the patient, as indicated above. Surgical revascularization and angioplasty are not indicated in patients with variant angina.

\section*{Unstable Angina \& Acute Coronary Syndromes}

In patients with unstable angina with recurrent ischemic episodes at rest, recurrent platelet-rich nonocclusive thrombus formation is the principal mechanism. Aggressive antiplatelet therapy with a combination of aspirin and clopidigrel is indicated. Intravenous heparin or subcutaneous low-molecularweight heparin is also indicated in most patients. If PCI with stenting is required, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors such as abciximab should be added. In addition, therapy with nitroglycerin and Bblockers should be considered; calcium channel blockers should be added in refractory cases for relief of myocardial ischemia.

\section*{DRUGS USED IN HEART FAILURE: INTRODUCTION}

Heart failure occurs when cardiac output is inadequate to provide the oxygen needed by the body. It is a highly lethal condition, with a 5 -year mortality rate conventionally said to be about $50 \%$. The most common cause of heart failure in the USA is coronary artery disease. Two major types of failure may be distinguished. In systolic failure, the mechanical pumping action (contractility) and the ejection fraction of the heart are reduced. In diastolic failure stiffening and loss of adequate relaxation plays a major role in reducing cardiac output and ejection fraction may be normal. Because other cardiovascular conditions are now being treated more effectively (especially myocardial infarction), more patients are surviving long enough for heart failure to develop, making this one of the cardiovascular conditions that is actually increasing in prevalence.

Although it is believed that the primary defect in early heart failure resides in the excitation-contraction coupling machinery of the heart, the clinical condition also involves many other processes and organs, including the baroreceptor reflex, the sympathetic nervous system, the kidneys, angiotensin II and other peptides, aldosterone, and apoptosis of cardiac cells. Recognition of these factors has resulted in evolution of a variety of treatment strategies (Table 13-1).

\section*{Table 13-1. Drug Groups Commonly Used in Heart Failure.}

Diuretics
Aldosterone receptor antagonists
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
Angiotensin receptor blockers
Beta blockers
Cardiac glycosides
Vasodilators
Beta agonists, dopamine
Bipyridines
Natriuretic peptide

Clinical research has shown that therapy directed at noncardiac targets is more valuable in the long-term treatment of heart failure than traditional positive inotropic agents (cardiac glycosides [digitalis]). Careful clinical trials have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, Bblockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and combined hydralazine-nitrate therapy are the only agents in current use that actually prolong life in patients with chronic heart failure. Positive inotropic drugs, on the other hand, can be very helpful in acute failure. They also reduce symptoms in chronic failure.

\section*{Control of Normal Cardiac Contractility}

The vigor of contraction of heart muscle is determined by several processes that lead to the movement of actin and myosin filaments in the cardiac sarcomere (Figure 13-1). Ultimately, contraction results from the interaction of activator calcium (during systole) with the actin-troponin-tropomyosin system, thereby releasing the actin-myosin interaction. This calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The amount released depends on the amount stored in the SR and on the amount of trigger calcium that enters the cell during the plateau of the action potential.
Figure 13-1.

Schematic diagram of a cardiac muscle sarcomere, with sites of action of several drugs that alter contractility (numbered structures). Site 1 is $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase, the sodium pump. Site $2(\mathrm{NaxC})$ is the sodium/calcium exchanger. Site 3 is the voltage-gated calcium channel. Site 4 (SERCA) is a calcium transporter that pumps calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Site 5 (RyR) is a calcium channel in the membrane of the SR that is triggered to release stored calcium by activator calcium. Site 6 is the actin-troponin-tropomyosin complex at which activator calcium brings about the contractile interaction of actin and myosin.

\section*{SENSITIVITY OF THE CONTRACTILE PROTEI NS TO CALCI UM}

The determinants of calcium sensitivity, ie, the curve relating the shortening of cardiac myofibrils to the cytoplasmic calcium concentration, are incompletely understood, but several types of drugs can be shown
to affect it in vitro. Levosimendan is the most recent example of a drug that increases calcium sensitivity (it may also inhibit phosphodiesterase) and reduces symptoms in models of heart failure.

\section*{THE AMOUNT OF CALCIUM RELEASED FROM THE SARCOPLASMIC RETICULUM}

A small rise in free cytoplasmic calcium, brought about by calcium influx during the action potential, triggers the opening of ryanodine-sensitive calcium channels (RyR2) in the membrane of the cardiac SR and the rapid release of a large amount of the ion into the cytoplasm in the vicinity of the actin-troponintropomyosin complex. The amount released is proportional to the amount stored in the SR and the amount of trigger calcium that enters the cell through the cell membrane. (Ryanodine is a potent negative inotropic plant alkaloid that interferes with the release of calcium through cardiac SR channels.)

\section*{THE AMOUNT OF CALCI UM STORED IN THE SARCOPLASMI C RETI CULUM}

The SR membrane contains a very efficient calcium uptake transporter, known as the sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-ATPase (SERCA). This pump maintains free cytoplasmic calcium at very low levels during diastole by pumping calcium into the SR. The amount of calcium sequestered in the SR is thus determined, in part, by the amount accessible to this transporter. This in turn is dependent on the balance of calcium influx (primarily through the voltage-gated membrane calcium channels) and calcium efflux, the amount removed from the cell (primarily via the sodium-calcium exchanger, a transporter in the cell membrane).

\section*{THE AMOUNT OF TRIGGER CALCI UM}

The amount of trigger calcium that enters the cell depends on the availability of membrane calcium channels (primarily the L type) and the duration of their opening. As described in Chapters 6 and 9, sympathomimetics cause an increase in calcium influx through an action on these channels. Conversely, the calcium channel blockers (see Chapter 12) reduce this influx and depress contractility.

\section*{ACTIVITY OF THE SODI UM-CALCI UM EXCHANGER}

This antiporter uses the sodium gradient to move calcium against its concentration gradient from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space. Extracellular concentrations of these ions are much less labile than intracellular concentrations under physiologic conditions. The sodium-calcium exchanger's ability to carry out this transport is thus strongly dependent on the intracellular concentrations of both ions, especially sodium.

\section*{INTRACELLULAR SODIUM CONCENTRATION AND ACTIVITY OF NA+ / K ${ }^{+}$ATPASE}
$\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase, by removing intracellular sodium, is the major determinant of sodium concentration in the cell. The sodium influx through voltage-gated channels, which occurs as a normal part of almost all cardiac action potentials, is another determinant although the amount of sodium that enters with each action potential is much less than $1 \%$ of the total intracellular sodium. As described below, $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase appears to be the primary target of cardiac glycosides.

\section*{Pathophysiology of Heart Failure}

Heart failure is a syndrome with multiple causes that may involve the right ventricle, the left ventricle, or both. Cardiac output in heart failure is usually below the normal range. Systolic dysfunction, with reduced cardiac output and significantly reduced ejection fraction ( $<45 \%$ ), is typical of acute failure, especially that resulting from myocardial infarction. Diastolic dysfunction often occurs as a result of hypertrophy and stiffening of the myocardium, and although cardiac output is reduced, ejection fraction may be normal. Heart failure due to diastolic dysfunction does not usually respond optimally to positive inotropic drugs.

Rarely, "high-output" failure may occur. In this condition, the demands of the body are so great that even increased cardiac output is insufficient. High-output failure can result from hyperthyroidism, beriberi, anemia, and arteriovenous shunts. This form of failure responds poorly to the drugs discussed in this chapter and should be treated by correcting the underlying cause.

The primary signs and symptoms of all types of heart failure include tachycardia, decreased exercise tolerance, shortness of breath, peripheral and pulmonary edema, and cardiomegaly. Decreased exercise tolerance with rapid muscular fatigue is the major direct consequence of diminished cardiac output. The other manifestations result from the attempts by the body to compensate for the intrinsic cardiac defect.

Neurohumoral (extrinsic) compensation involves two major mechanisms previously presented in Figure 6-7: the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone hormonal response. Some of the pathologic as well as beneficial features of these compensatory responses are illustrated in Figure 13-2. The baroreceptor reflex appears to be reset, with a lower sensitivity to arterial pressure, in patients with heart failure. As a result, baroreceptor sensory input to the vasomotor center is reduced even at normal pressures; sympathetic outflow is increased, and parasympathetic outflow is decreased. Increased sympathetic outflow causes tachycardia, increased cardiac contractility, and increased vascular tone.
Figure 13-2.

Some compensatory responses that occur during congestive heart failure. In addition to the effects shown, angiotensin II increases sympathetic effects by facilitating norepinephrine release.

While the increased preload, force, and heart rate initially increase cardiac output, increased arterial tone results in increased afterload and decreased ejection fraction, cardiac output, and renal perfusion. After a
relatively short time, complex down-regulatory changes in the $B_{1}$-adrenoceptor-G protein-effector system take place that result in diminished stimulatory effects. Beta ${ }_{2}$ receptors are not down-regulated and may develop increased coupling to the IP ${ }_{3}$-DAG cascade. It has also been suggested that cardiac $\mathrm{B}_{3}$ receptors (which do not appear to be down-regulated in failure) may mediate negative inotropic effects. Excessive beta activation can lead to leakage of calcium from the SR via RyR2 channels and contributes to stiffening of the ventricles and arrhythmias. Increased angiotensin II production leads to increased aldosterone secretion (with sodium and water retention), to increased afterload, and to remodeling of both heart and vessels (discussed below). Other hormones may also be released, including natriuretic peptide and endothelin (see Chapter 17).

The most important intrinsic compensatory mechanism is myocardial hypertrophy. This increase in muscle mass helps maintain cardiac performance. However, after an initial beneficial effect, hypertrophy can lead to ischemic changes, impairment of diastolic filling, and alterations in ventricular geometry.
Remodeling is the term applied to dilation (other than that due to passive stretch) and other slow structural changes that occur in the stressed myocardium. It may include proliferation of connective tissue cells as well as abnormal myocardial cells with some biochemical characteristics of fetal myocytes. Ultimately, myocytes in the failing heart die at an accelerated rate through apoptosis, leaving the remaining myocytes subject to even greater stress.

The severity of heart failure is usually described according to a scale devised by the New York Heart Association. Class I failure is associated with no limitations on ordinary activities and symptoms that occur only with greater than ordinary exercise. Class II is characterized by slight limitation of ordinary activities, which result in fatigue and palpitations with ordinary physical activity. Class III failure results in no symptoms at rest, but fatigue, etc, with less than ordinary physical activity. Class IV is associated with symptoms even when the patient is at rest.

\section*{Pathophysiology of Cardiac Performance}

Cardiac performance is a function of four primary factors:
(1) Preload: When some measure of left ventricular performance such as stroke volume or stroke work is plotted as a function of left ventricular filling pressure or end-diastolic fiber length, the resulting curve is termed the left ventricular function curve (Figure 13-3). The ascending limb ( $<15 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ filling pressure) represents the classic Frank-Starling relation. Beyond approximately 15 mm Hg , there is a plateau of performance. Preloads greater than $20-25 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ result in pulmonary congestion. As noted above, preload is usually increased in heart failure because of increased blood volume and venous tone. Because the curve of the failing heart is lower, the plateau is reached at much lower values of stroke work or output. Increased fiber length or filling pressure increases oxygen demand in the myocardium. Reduction of high filling pressure is the goal of salt restriction and diuretic therapy in heart failure. Venodilator drugs (eg, nitroglycerin) also reduce preload by redistributing blood away from the chest into peripheral veins.
(2) Afterload: Afterload is the resistance against which the heart must pump blood and is represented by aortic impedance and systemic vascular resistance. As cardiac output falls in chronic failure, there is a reflex increase in systemic vascular resistance, mediated in part by increased sympathetic outflow and circulating catecholamines and in part by activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Endothelin, a potent
vasoconstrictor peptide, may also be involved. This sets the stage for the use of drugs that reduce arteriolar tone in heart failure.
(3) Contractility: Heart muscle obtained by biopsy from patients with chronic low-output failure demonstrates a reduction in intrinsic contractility. As contractility decreases in the patient, there is a reduction in the velocity of muscle shortening, the rate of intraventricular pressure development (dP/dt), and the stroke output achieved (Figure 13-3). However, the heart is still capable of some increase in all of these measures of contractility in response to inotropic drugs.
(4) Heart rate: The heart rate is a major determinant of cardiac output. As the intrinsic function of the heart decreases in failure and stroke volume diminishes, an increase in heart rate-through sympathetic activation of Badrenoceptors-is the first compensatory mechanism that comes into play to maintain cardiac output.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF DRUGS USED IN HEART FAI LURE}

Although digitalis is not the first drug and never the only drug used in heart failure, we begin our discussion with this group because other drugs are discussed in more detail in other chapters. For a more detailed discussion of the cardiac glycosides the reader is referred to earlier editions of this book.

\section*{DIGITALIS}

Digitalis is the genus name for the family of plants that provide most of the medically useful cardiac glycosides, eg, digoxin. Such plants have been known for thousands of years but were used erratically and with variable success until 1785, when William Withering, an English physician and botanist, published a monograph describing the clinical effects of an extract of the purple foxglove plant (Digitalis purpurea, $a$ major source of these agents).

\section*{Chemistry}

All of the cardiac glycosides, or cardenolides-of which digoxin is the prototype-combine a steroid nucleus linked to a lactone ring at the 17 position and a series of sugars at carbon 3 of the nucleus. Because they lack an easily ionizable group, their solubility is not pH-dependent. Digoxin is obtained from Digitalis lanata , the white foxglove, but many common plants contain cardiac glycosides.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

\section*{ABSORPTION AND DISTRIBUTION}

Digoxin, the only cardiac glycoside used in the USA, is 65-80\% absorbed after oral administration. Absorption of other glycosides varies from zero to nearly 100\%. Once present in the blood, all cardiac glycosides are widely distributed to tissues, including the central nervous system.

\section*{METABOLISM AND EXCRETION}

Digoxin is not extensively metabolized in humans; almost two thirds is excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Its renal clearance is proportionate to creatinine clearance. Equations and nomograms are available for adjusting digoxin dosage in patients with renal impairment.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Digoxin has multiple direct and indirect cardiovascular effects, with both therapeutic and toxic consequences. In addition, it has undesirable effects on the central nervous system and gut.

At the molecular level, all therapeutically useful cardiac glycosides inhibit Na ${ }^{+} / \mathbf{K}{ }^{+}$ATPase, the
membrane-bound transporter often called the sodium pump. Inhibition of this transporter over most of the dose range has been extensively documented in all tissues studied. It is probable that this inhibitory action is largely responsible for the therapeutic effect (positive inotropy) as well as a major portion of the toxicity of digitalis. Other molecular-level effects of digitalis have been studied in the heart and are discussed below. The fact that a receptor for cardiac glycosides exists on the sodium pump has prompted some investigators to propose that an endogenous "digitalis-like" steroid, possibly ouabain, must exist.

\section*{CARDIAC EFFECTS}

\section*{Mechanical Effects}

Cardiac glycosides increase contraction of the cardiac sarcomere (Figure 13-1) by increasing the free calcium concentration in the vicinity of the contractile proteins during systole. The increase in calcium concentration is the result of a two-step process: first, an increase of intracellular sodium concentration because of $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase inhibition (1 in Figure 13-1); and second, a relative reduction of calcium expulsion from the cell by the sodium-calcium exchanger (NaxC in Figure 13-1) caused by the increase in intracellular sodium. The increased cytoplasmic calcium is sequestered by the SERCA in the SR for later release. Other mechanisms have been proposed but are not well supported.

The net result of the action of therapeutic concentrations of a cardiac glycoside is a distinctive increase in cardiac contractility (Figure 13-4, bottom trace). In isolated myocardial preparations, the rate of development of tension and of relaxation are both increased, with little or no change in time to peak tension. This effect occurs in both normal and failing myocardium, but in the intact animal or patient the responses are modified by cardiovascular reflexes and the pathophysiology of heart failure.

Wier.)

\section*{Electrical Effects}

The effects of digitalis on the electrical properties of the heart are a mixture of direct and autonomic actions. Direct actions on the membranes of cardiac cells follow a well-defined progression: an early, brief prolongation of the action potential, followed by shortening (especially the plateau phase). The decrease in action potential duration is probably the result of increased potassium conductance that is caused by increased intracellular calcium (see Chapter 14). All of these effects can be observed at therapeutic concentrations in the absence of overt toxicity (Table 13-2).
Table 13-2. Effects of Digoxin on Electrical Properties of Cardiac Tissues.

At higher concentrations, resting membrane potential is reduced (made less negative) as a result of inhibition of the sodium pump and reduced intracellular potassium. As toxicity progresses, oscillatory depolarizing afterpotentials appear following normally evoked action potentials (Figure 13-4, panel B). The afterpotentials (also known as delayed afterdepolarizations, DADs ) are associated with overloading of the intracellular calcium stores and oscillations in the free intracellular calcium ion concentration. When afterpotentials reach threshold, they elicit action potentials (premature depolarizations or ectopic "beats") that are coupled to the preceding normal action potentials. If afterpotentials in the Purkinje conducting
system regularly reach threshold in this way, bigeminy will be recorded on the electrocardiogram (Figure 13-5). With further intoxication, each afterpotential-evoked action potential will itself elicit a suprathreshold afterpotential, and a self-sustaining tachycardia will be established. If allowed to progress, such a tachycardia may deteriorate into fibrillation; in the case of ventricular fibrillation, the arrhythmia will be rapidly fatal unless corrected.

Electrocardiographic record showing digitalis-induced bigeminy. The complexes marked NSR are normal sinus rhythm beats; an inverted T wave and depressed ST segment are present. The complexes marked PVB are premature ventricular beats and are the electrocardiographic manifestations of depolarizations evoked by delayed oscillatory afterpotentials as shown in Figure 13-4. (Modified and reproduced, with permission, from Goldman MJ: Principles of Clinical Electrocardiography, 12th ed. Lange, 1986.)

Autonomic actions of cardiac glycosides on the heart involve both the parasympathetic and the sympathetic systems. In the lower portion of the dose range, cardioselective parasympathomimetic effects predominate. In fact, these atropine-blockable effects account for a significant portion of the early electrical effects of digitalis (Table 13-2). This action involves sensitization of the baroreceptors, central vagal stimulation, and facilitation of muscarinic transmission at the cardiac muscle cell. Because cholinergic innervation is much richer in the atria, these actions affect atrial and atrioventricular nodal function more than Purkinje or ventricular function. Some of the cholinomimetic effects are useful in the treatment of certain arrhythmias. At toxic levels, sympathetic outflow is increased by digitalis. This effect is not essential for typical digitalis toxicity but sensitizes the myocardium and exaggerates all the toxic effects of the drug.

The most common cardiac manifestations of digitalis toxicity include atrioventricular junctional rhythm, premature ventricular depolarizations, bigeminal rhythm, and second-degree atrioventricular blockade. However, it is claimed that digitalis can cause virtually any arrhythmia.

\section*{EFFECTS ON OTHER ORGANS}

Cardiac glycosides affect all excitable tissues, including smooth muscle and the central nervous system. The gastrointestinal tract is the most common site of digitalis toxicity outside the heart. The effects include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. This toxicity may be partially caused by direct effects on the gastrointestinal tract but is also the result of central nervous system actions.

Central nervous system effects include vagal and chemoreceptor trigger zone stimulation. Less often, disorientation and hallucinations-especially in the elderly-and visual disturbances are noted. The latter effect may include aberrations of color perception. Gynecomastia is a rare effect reported in men taking
digitalis.

\section*{I NTERACTIONS WITH POTASSIUM, CALCIUM, AND MAGNESIUM}

Potassium and digitalis interact in two ways. First, they inhibit each other's binding to $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase; therefore, hyperkalemia reduces the enzyme-inhibiting actions of cardiac glycosides, whereas hypokalemia facilitates these actions. Second, abnormal cardiac automaticity is inhibited by hyperkalemia (see Chapter 14). Moderately increased extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$therefore reduces the effects of digitalis, especially the toxic effects.

Calcium ion facilitates the toxic actions of cardiac glycosides by accelerating the overloading of intracellular calcium stores that appears to be responsible for digitalis-induced abnormal automaticity. Hypercalcemia therefore increases the risk of a digitalis-induced arrhythmia. The effects of magnesium ion appear to be opposite to those of calcium. These interactions mandate careful evaluation of serum electrolytes in patients with digitalis-induced arrhythmias.

\section*{Other Positive I notropic Drugs Used in Heart Failure}

Drugs that inhibit phosphodiesterases, the family of enzymes that inactivate cAMP and cGMP, have long been used in therapy of heart failure. Although they have positive inotropic effects, most of their benefits appear to derive from vasodilation, as discussed below. The bipyridines inamrinone and milrinone are the most successful of these agents found to date, but their usefulness is quite limited. Levosimendan, an investigational drug that sensitizes the troponin system to calcium, also appears to inhibit phosphodiesterase and cause some vasodilation in addition to its inotropic effects. Some early clinical trials suggest that this drug may be useful in patients with heart failure. A group of B-adrenoceptor stimulants has also been used as digitalis substitutes, but they may increase mortality (see below).

\section*{BI PYRI DI NES}

Inamrinone (previously called amrinone) and milrinone are bipyridine compounds that inhibit phosphodiesterase isozyme 3 (PDE-3). They are active orally as well as parenterally but are only available in parenteral forms. They have elimination half-lives of $3-6$ hours, with $10-40 \%$ being excreted in the urine.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

The bipyridines increase myocardial contractility by increasing inward calcium flux in the heart during the action potential; they may also alter the intracellular movements of calcium by influencing the sarcoplasmic reticulum. They also have an important vasodilating effect. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase results in an increase in cAMP and the increase in contractility and vasodilation.

The toxicity of inamrinone includes nausea and vomiting; arrhythmias, thrombocytopenia, and liver enzyme changes have also been reported in a significant number of patients. This drug has been withdrawn in some countries. Milrinone appears less likely to cause bone marrow and liver toxicity than inamrinone, but it does cause arrhythmias. Inamrinone and milrinone are now used only intravenously and only for acute heart failure or for severe exacerbation of chronic heart failure.

\section*{BETA-ADRENOCEPTOR STI MULANTS}

The general pharmacology of these agents is discussed in Chapter 9. The selective $B_{1}$ agonist that has been most widely used in patients with heart failure is dobutamine. This parenteral drug produces an increase
in cardiac output together with a decrease in ventricular filling pressure. Some tachycardia and an increase in myocardial oxygen consumption have been reported. Therefore, the potential for producing angina or arrhythmias in patients with coronary artery disease must be considered, as well as the tachyphylaxis that accompanies the use of any Bstimulant. Intermittent dobutamine infusion may benefit some patients with chronic heart failure.

Dopamine has also been used in acute heart failure and may be particularly helpful if there is a need to raise blood pressure.

\section*{Drugs Without Positive I notropic Effects Used in Heart Failure}

Paradoxically, these agents—not positive inotropic drugs—are the first-line therapies for chronic heart failure. The drugs most commonly used are diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, and Bblockers (see Table 13-1). In acute failure, diuretics and vasodilators play important roles.

\section*{DIURETICS}

The diuretics are discussed in detail in Chapter 15. Their major mechanism of action in heart failure is to reduce venous pressure and ventricular preload. This results in reduction of edema and its symptoms, and reduction of cardiac size, which leads to improved pump efficiency. Spironolactone and eplerenone, the aldosterone antagonist diuretics (see Chapter 15), have the additional benefit of decreasing morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure who are also receiving ACE inhibitors and other standard therapy. One possible mechanism for this benefit lies in accumulating evidence that aldosterone may also cause myocardial and vascular fibrosis and baroreceptor dysfunction in addition to its renal effects.

\section*{ANGI OTENSI N-CONVERTI NG ENZYME INHIBITORS, ANGI OTENSI N RECEPTOR BLOCKERS, \& RELATED AGENTS}

The ACE inhibitors such as captopril are introduced in Chapter 11 and discussed again in Chapter 17.
These versatile drugs reduce peripheral resistance and thereby reduce afterload; they also reduce salt and water retention (by reducing aldosterone secretion) and in that way reduce preload. The reduction in tissue angiotensin levels also reduces sympathetic activity, probably through diminution of angiotensin's presynaptic effects on norepinephrine release. Finally, these drugs reduce the long-term remodeling of the heart and vessels, an effect that may be responsible for the observed reduction in mortality and morbidity (see Clinical Pharmacology).

Angiotensin $A T_{1}$ receptor-blockers such as losartan (see Chapters 11 and 17) appear to have similar but more limited beneficial effects. Angiotensin receptor blockers should be considered in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors. In some trials, candesartan was beneficial when added to an ACE inhibitor.

\section*{VASODI LATORS}

The vasodilators are effective in acute heart failure because they provide a reduction in preload (through venodilation), or reduction in afterload (through arteriolar dilation), or both. Some evidence suggests that long-term use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate can also reduce damaging remodeling of the heart.

A synthetic form of the endogenous peptide brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is approved for use in acute cardiac failure as nesiritide. This recombinant product increases cGMP in smooth muscle cells and reduces venous and arteriolar tone in experimental preparations. It also causes diuresis. The peptide has a short half-life of about 18 minutes and is administered as a bolus intravenous dose followed by continuous
infusion. Excessive hypotension is the most common adverse effect. Reports of significant renal damage and deaths have resulted in application of extra warnings regarding this agent and it should be used with great caution.

Measurement of endogenous BNP has been proposed as a diagnostic test because plasma concentrations rise in most patients with heart failure.

Bosentan, an orally active competitive inhibitor of endothelin (see Chapter 17), has been shown to have some benefits in experimental animal models of heart failure, but results in human trials have been disappointing. This drug is approved for use in pulmonary hypertension (see Chapter 11). It has significant teratogenic and hepatotoxic effects.

\section*{BETA-ADRENOCEPTOR BLOCKERS}

Most patients with chronic heart failure respond favorably to certain Bblockers in spite of the fact that these drugs can precipitate acute decompensation of cardiac function (see Chapter 10). Studies with bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol showed a reduction in mortality in patients with stable severe heart failure but this effect was not observed with another Bblocker, bucindolol. A full understanding of the beneficial action of Bblockade is lacking, but suggested mechanisms include attenuation of the adverse effects of high concentrations of catecholamines (including apoptosis), up-regulation of Breceptors, decreased heart rate, and reduced remodeling through inhibition of the mitogenic activity of catecholamines.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF DRUGS USED IN HEART FAI LURE}

In the past, prescription of a diuretic plus digitalis was almost automatic in every case of chronic heart failure, and other drugs were rarely considered. At present, diuretics are still considered as first-line therapy, but digitalis is reserved for patients who do not respond adequately to diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and Bblockers (see Table 13-1).

\section*{Management of Chronic Heart Failure}

The major steps in the management of patients with chronic heart failure are outlined in Table 13-3. Reduction of cardiac workload is helpful in most cases. This can be accomplished by reducing activity and weight, and-especially important-control of hypertension.
Table 13-3. Steps in the Treatment of Chronic Heart Failure.
1. Reduce workload of the heart
a. Limit activity, put on bed rest
b. Reduce weight
c. Control hypertension
2. Restrict sodium intake
3. Restrict water (rarely required)
4. Give diuretics
5. Give ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker
6. Give digitalis if systolic dysfunction with 3rd heart sound or atrial fibrillation is present
7. Give Bblockers to patients with stable class II-IV heart failure
8. Give vasodilators
9. Cardiac resynchronization if wide QRS interval is present in normal sinus rhythm

\section*{SODIUM REMOVAL}

Sodium removal is the next important step-by dietary salt restriction or a diuretic-especially if edema is present. In mild failure, it is reasonable to start with a thiazide diuretic, switching to agents such as furosemide as required. Sodium loss causes secondary loss of potassium, which is particularly hazardous if the patient is to be given digitalis. Hypokalemia can be treated with potassium supplementation or through the addition of an ACE inhibitor or a potassium-sparing diuretic such as spironolactone. As noted above, spironolactone or eplerenone should probably be considered in all patients with moderate or severe heart failure since they appear to reduce both morbidity and mortality. Serum potassium should be monitored in patients receiving any of these agents.

\section*{ACE INHIBITORS \& ANGIOTENSIN RECEPTOR BLOCKERS}

In patients with left ventricular dysfunction but no edema, an ACE inhibitor should be used first. Several large studies have compared ACE inhibitors with digoxin or with other traditional therapies for chronic heart failure. The results show clearly that ACE inhibitors are superior to both placebo and to vasodilators and must be considered, along with diuretics, as first-line therapy for chronic failure. However, ACE inhibitors cannot replace digoxin in patients already receiving that drug because patients withdrawn from the cardiac glycoside deteriorate while on ACE inhibitor therapy.

By reducing preload and afterload in asymptomatic patients, ACE inhibitors appear to slow the progress of ventricular dilation and thus delay the onset of clinical heart failure. Thus, ACE inhibitors are beneficial in all subsets of patients, from those who are asymptomatic to those in severe chronic failure. This benefit appears to be a class effect, ie, all ACE inhibitors appear to be effective.

The angiotensin II AT ${ }_{1}$ receptor blockers (ARBs, eg, losartan, candesartan, etc) produce beneficial hemodynamic effects similar to those of the ACE inhibitors. However, large clinical trials suggest that the angiotensin receptor blockers should only be used in patients who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors (usually because of cough).

\section*{VASODI LATORS}

Vasodilator drugs can be divided into selective arteriolar dilators, venous dilators, and drugs with nonselective vasodilatory effects. For this purpose, the ACE inhibitors may be considered nonselective arteriolar and venous dilators. The choice of agent should be based on the patient's signs and symptoms and hemodynamic measurements. Thus, in patients with high filling pressures in whom the principal symptom is dyspnea, venous dilators such as long-acting nitrates will be most helpful in reducing filling pressures and the symptoms of pulmonary congestion. In patients in whom fatigue due to low left ventricular output is a primary symptom, an arteriolar dilator such as hydralazine may be helpful in increasing forward cardiac output. In most patients with severe chronic failure that responds poorly to other therapy, the problem usually involves both elevated filling pressures and reduced cardiac output. In these
circumstances, dilation of both arterioles and veins is required. In a trial in African-American patients already receiving ACE inhibitors, addition of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate reduced mortality.

\section*{BETA BLOCKERS \& CALCI UM CHANNEL BLOCKERS}

Trials of B-blocker therapy in patients with heart failure are based on the hypothesis that excessive tachycardia and adverse effects of high catecholamine levels on the heart contribute to the downward course of heart failure patients. The results clearly indicate that such therapy is beneficial if initiated very cautiously at low doses, even though acutely blocking the supportive effects of catecholamines can worsen heart failure. Several months of therapy may be required before improvement is noted; this usually consists of a slight rise in ejection fraction, slower heart rate, and reduction in symptoms. As noted above, bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol have been shown to reduce mortality.

In contrast, the calcium-blocking drugs appear to have no role in the treatment of patients with heart failure. Their depressant effects on the heart may worsen heart failure.

\section*{DIGITALIS}

Digoxin is indicated in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. It is also most helpful in patients with a dilated heart and third heart sound. It is usually given only if diuretics and ACE inhibitors have failed to control symptoms. Only about 50\% of patients with normal sinus rhythm (usually those with documented systolic dysfunction) will have documentable relief of heart failure from digitalis. Better results are obtained in patients with atrial fibrillation. If the decision is made to use a cardiac glycoside, digoxin is the one chosen in the great majority of cases (and the only one available in the USA). When symptoms are mild, slow loading (digitalization) with $0.125-0.25 \mathrm{mg}$ per day is safer and just as effective as the rapid method ( $0.5-0.75 \mathrm{mg}$ every 8 hours for 3 doses, followed by $0.125-0.25 \mathrm{mg}$ per day).

Determining the optimal level of digitalis effect may be difficult. In patients with atrial fibrillation, reduction of ventricular rate is the best measure of glycoside effect. In patients in normal sinus rhythm, symptomatic improvement and reductions in heart size, heart rate during exercise, venous pressure, or edema may signify optimum drug levels in the myocardium. Unfortunately, toxic effects may occur before the therapeutic end point is detected. If digitalis is being loaded slowly, simple omission of one dose and halving the maintenance dose will often bring the patient to the narrow range between suboptimal and toxic concentrations. Measurement of plasma digoxin levels is useful in patients who appear unusually resistant or sensitive; a level of $1 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ or less is appropriate.

Because it has a moderate but persistent positive inotropic effect, digitalis can, in theory, reverse all the signs and symptoms of heart failure. Although the drug has no net effect on mortality, it reduces hospitalization and deaths from progressive heart failure at the expense of an increase in sudden death. It is important to note that the mortality rate is reduced in patients with serum digoxin concentrations of less than $0.9 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ but increased in those with digoxin levels greater than $1.5 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$.

\section*{Other Clinical Uses of Digitalis}

Digitalis is useful in the management of atrial arrhythmias because of its cardioselective parasympathomimetic effects. In atrial flutter and fibrillation, the depressant effect of the drug on atrioventricular conduction will help control an excessively high ventricular rate. Digitalis has also been used in the control of paroxysmal atrial and atrioventricular nodal tachycardia. At present, calcium channel blockers and adenosine are preferred for this application.

Digitalis should be avoided in the therapy of arrhythmias associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome because it increases the probability of conduction of arrhythmic atrial impulses through the alternative rapidly conducting atrioventricular pathway. It is explicitly contraindicated in patients with Wolff-ParkinsonWhite syndrome and atrial fibrillation (see Chapter 14).

\section*{Toxicity}

In spite of its limited benefits and recognized hazards, digitalis is still heavily used and toxicity is common. Therapy of toxicity manifested as visual changes or gastrointestinal disturbances generally requires no more than reducing the dose of the drug. If cardiac arrhythmia is present and can definitely be ascribed to digitalis, more vigorous therapy may be necessary. Serum digitalis and potassium levels and the electrocardiogram should always be monitored during therapy of significant digitalis toxicity. Electrolyte status should be corrected if abnormal (see above).

In severe digitalis intoxication, serum potassium will already be elevated at the time of diagnosis (because of potassium loss from the intracellular compartment of skeletal muscle and other tissues). Furthermore, automaticity is usually depressed, and antiarrhythmic agents administered in this setting may lead to cardiac arrest. Such patients are best treated with prompt insertion of a temporary cardiac pacemaker catheter and administration of digitalis antibodies (digoxin immune fab). These antibodies recognize digitoxin and cardiac glycosides from many other plants in addition to digoxin. They are extremely useful in reversing severe intoxication with most glycosides.

Digitalis-induced arrhythmias are frequently made worse by cardioversion; this therapy should be reserved for ventricular fibrillation if the arrhythmia is glycoside-induced.

\section*{Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy}

Patients with normal sinus rhythm and a wide QRS interval have some dyssynchronization of ventricular contraction. Poor synchronization of left ventricular contraction results in diminished cardiac output. Resynchronization, with left ventricular or biventricular pacing, has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with chronic heart failure who were already receiving optimal medical therapy.

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE HEART FAI LURE}

Acute heart failure occurs frequently in patients with chronic failure. Such episodes are usually associated with increased exertion, emotion, salt in the diet, noncompliance with medical therapy, or increased metabolic demand occasioned by fever, anemia, etc. A particularly common and important cause of acute failure-with or without chronic failure-is acute myocardial infarction.

Patients with acute myocardial infarction are best treated with emergency revascularization using either coronary angioplasty and a stent or a thrombolytic agent. Even with revascularization, acute failure may develop in such patients. Many of the signs and symptoms of acute and chronic failure are identical, but their therapies diverge because of the need for more rapid response and the relatively greater frequency and severity of pulmonary vascular congestion in the acute form.

Measurements of arterial pressure, cardiac output, stroke work index, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure are particularly useful in patients with acute myocardial infarction and acute heart failure. Such patients can be usefully characterized on the basis of three hemodynamic measurements: arterial pressure, left ventricular filling pressure, and cardiac index. One such classification and therapies that have proved most effective are set forth in Table 13-4. When filling pressure is greater than 15 mm Hg and stroke work
index is less than $20 \mathrm{gm} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$, the mortality rate is high. Intermediate levels of these two variables imply a much better prognosis.

(RVFP and LVFP = right and left ventricular filling pressures.)

Among patients with acute decompensation, a small subset is found to have hyponatremia, presumably due to increased vasopressin activity. A new $V_{1 a}$ and $V_{2}$ receptor antagonist, conivaptan, has recently been approved for the parenteral treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia. Several clinical trials have indicated that this drug and related $\mathrm{V}_{2}$ antagonists may have a beneficial effect in some patients with acute heart failure and hyponatremia.

\section*{AGENTS USED IN CARDI AC ARRHYTHMI AS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Cardiac arrhythmias are a frequent problem in clinical practice, occurring in up to $25 \%$ of patients treated with digitalis, $50 \%$ of anesthetized patients, and over $80 \%$ of patients with acute myocardial infarction. Arrhythmias may require treatment because rhythms that are too rapid, too slow, or asynchronous can reduce cardiac output. Some arrhythmias can precipitate more serious or even lethal rhythm disturbances-eg, early premature ventricular depolarizations can precipitate ventricular fibrillation. In such patients, antiarrhythmic drugs may be lifesaving. On the other hand, the hazards of antiarrhythmic drugs-and in particular the fact that they can precipitate lethal arrhythmias in some patients-has led to a reevaluation of their relative risks and benefits. In general, treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic arrhythmias should be avoided for this reason.

Arrhythmias can be treated with the drugs discussed in this chapter and with nonpharmacologic therapies such as pacemakers, cardioversion, catheter ablation, and surgery. This chapter describes the pharmacology of drugs that suppress arrhythmias by a direct action on the cardiac cell membrane. Other modes of therapy are discussed briefly (see The Nonpharmacologic Therapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias).

\section*{THE NONPHARMACOLOGI C THERAPY OF CARDI AC ARRHYTHMI AS}

It was recognized over 100 years ago that reentry in simple in vitro models (eg, rings of conducting tissues) was permanently interrupted by transecting the reentry circuit. This concept is now applied in cardiac arrhythmias with defined anatomic pathways-eg, atrioventricular reentry using accessory pathways, atrioventricular node reentry, atrial flutter, and some forms of ventricular tachycardia-by treatment with radiofrequency catheter ablation. Recent studies have shown that paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation may arise from one of the pulmonary veins. Both forms of atrial fibrillation can be cured by electrically isolating the pulmonary veins by radiofrequency catheter ablation or during concomitant cardiac surgery.

Another form of nonpharmacologic therapy is the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), a device that can automatically detect and treat potentially fatal arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation. ICDs are now widely used in patients who have been resuscitated from such arrhythmias, and several trials have shown that ICD treatment reduces mortality in patients with coronary artery disease who have an ejection fraction $s$ $30 \%$ and in patients with class 2 or 3 heart failure and no prior history of arrhythmias. The increasing use of nonpharmacologic antiarrhythmic therapies reflects both advances in the relevant technologies and an increasing appreciation of the dangers of long-term therapy with currently available drugs.

\section*{ELECTROPHYSI OLOGY OF NORMAL CARDI AC RHYTHM}

The electrical impulse that triggers a normal cardiac contraction originates at regular intervals in the sinoatrial node (Figure 14-1), usually at a frequency of 60-100 beats per minute. This impulse spreads rapidly through the atria and enters the atrioventricular node, which is normally the only conduction pathway between the atria and ventricles. Conduction through the atrioventricular node is slow, requiring about 0.15 s . (This delay provides time for atrial contraction to propel blood into the ventricles.) The impulse then propagates over the His-Purkinje system and invades all parts of the ventricles, beginning with the endocardial surface near the apex and ending with the epicardial surface at the base of the heart. Ventricular activation is complete in less
than 0.1 s ; therefore, contraction of all of the ventricular muscle is normally synchronous and hemodynamically effective.

Schematic representation of the heart and normal cardiac electrical activity (intracellular recordings from areas indicated and ECG). Sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node, and Purkinje cells display pacemaker activity (phase 4 depolarization). The ECG is the body surface manifestation of the depolarization and repolarization waves of the heart. The P wave is generated by atrial depolarization, the QRS by ventricular muscle depolarization, and the T wave by ventricular repolarization. Thus, the PR interval is a measure of conduction time from atrium to ventricle, and the QRS duration indicates the time required for all of the ventricular cells to be activated (ie, the intraventricular conduction time). The QT interval reflects the duration of the ventricular action potential.

Arrhythmias consist of cardiac depolarizations that deviate from the above description in one or more aspects- ie, there is an abnormality in the site of origin of the impulse, its rate or regularity, or its conduction.

\section*{I onic Basis of Membrane Electrical Activity}

The transmembrane potential of cardiac cells is determined by the concentrations of several ions-chiefly sodium ( $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$), potassium ( $\mathrm{K}^{+}$), calcium ( $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ), and chloride ( $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$)-on either side of the membrane and the permeability of the membrane to each ion. These water-soluble ions are unable to freely diffuse across the lipid cell membrane in response to their electrical and concentration gradients; they require aqueous channels (specific pore-forming proteins) for such diffusion. Thus, ions move across cell membranes in response to their gradients only at specific times during the cardiac cycle when these ion channels are open. The movements of the ions produce currents that form the basis of the cardiac action potential. Individual channels are relatively ion-specific, and the flux of ions through them is thought to be controlled by "gates" (probably flexible peptide chains or energy barriers). Each type of channel has its own type of gate (sodium, calcium, and some potassium channels are each thought to have two types of gates), and each type of gate is opened and closed by specific transmembrane voltage, ionic, or metabolic conditions.

At rest, most cells are not significantly permeable to sodium, but at the start of each action potential, they become quite permeable (see below). In electrophysiologic terms, the conductance of the fast sodium channel suddenly increases in response to a depolarizing stimulus. Similarly, calcium enters and potassium leaves the cell with each action potential. Therefore, in addition to ion channels, the cell must have mechanisms to maintain stable transmembrane ionic conditions by establishing and maintaining ion gradients. The most important of these active mechanisms is the sodium pump, $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase, described in Chapter 13. This pump and other active ion carriers contribute indirectly to the transmembrane potential by maintaining the gradients necessary for diffusion through channels. In addition, some pumps and exchangers produce net current flow (eg, by exchanging three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$for two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions) and hence are termed "electrogenic."

When the cardiac cell membrane becomes permeable to a specific ion (ie when the channels selective for that ion are open), movement of that ion across the cell membrane is determined by Ohm's law: current $=$ voltage $\div$ resistance, or current $=$ voltage $\times$ conductance. Conductance is determined by the properties of the individual ion channel protein. The voltage term is the difference between the actual membrane potential and the reversal potential for that ion (the membrane potential at which no current would flow even if channels were open). For example, in the case of sodium in a cardiac cell at rest, there is a substantial concentration gradient ( $140 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{Na}^{+}$outside; $10-15 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{Na}^{+}$inside) and an electrical gradient ( 0 mV outside; -90 mV inside) that would drive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$into cells. Sodium does not enter the cell at rest because sodium channels are closed; when sodium channels open, the very large influx of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions accounts for phase 0 depolarization. The situation for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions in the resting cardiac cell is quite different. Here, the concentration gradient ( $140 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ inside; $4 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ outside) would drive the ion out of the cell, but the electrical gradient would drive it in; that is, the inward gradient is in equilibrium with the outward gradient. In fact, certain potassium channels ("inward rectifier" channels) are open in the resting cell, but little current flows through them because of this balance. The equilibrium, or reversal potential, for ions is determined by the Nernst equation:
$E_{\text {ion }}=61 \times \log \left(\frac{C_{e}}{C_{i}}\right)$
where $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{e}}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{i}}$ are the extracellular and intracellular concentrations, respectively, multiplied by their activity
coefficients. Note that raising extracellular potassium makes $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{K}}$ less negative. When this occurs, the membrane depolarizes until the new $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{K}}$ is reached. Thus, extracellular potassium concentration and inward rectifier channel function are the major factors determining the membrane potential of the resting cardiac cell. The conditions required for application of the Nernst equation are approximated at the peak of the overshoot (using sodium concentrations) and during rest (using potassium concentrations) in most nonpacemaker cardiac cells. If the permeability is significant for both potassium and sodium, the Nernst equation is not a good predictor of membrane potential, but the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation may be used:
$E_{\text {mem }}=61 \times \log \left(\frac{P_{K} \times K_{e}+P_{N_{a}} \times N a_{e}}{P_{K} \times K_{i}+P_{N_{a}} \times N a_{i}}\right)$

In pacemaker cells (whether normal or ectopic), spontaneous depolarization (the pacemaker potential) occurs during diastole (phase 4, Figure 14-1). This depolarization results from a gradual increase of depolarizing current through special hyperpolarization-activated ion channels in pacemaker cells. The effect of changing extracellular potassium is more complex in a pacemaker cell than it is in a nonpacemaker cell because the effect on permeability to potassium is much more important in a pacemaker (see Effects of Potassium). In a pacemaker-especially an ectopic one-the end result of an increase in extracellular potassium will usually be to slow or stop the pacemaker. Conversely, hypokalemia will often facilitate ectopic pacemakers.

\section*{EFFECTS OF POTASSI UM}

The effects of changes in serum potassium on cardiac action potential duration, pacemaker rate, and arrhythmias can appear somewhat paradoxical if changes are predicted based solely on a consideration of changes in the potassium electrochemical gradient. In the heart, however, changes in serum potassium concentration have the additional effect of altering potassium conductance (increased extracellular potassium increases potassium conductance) independent of simple changes in electrochemical driving force, and this effect often predominates. As a result, the actual observed effects of hyperkalemia include reduced action potential duration, slowed conduction, decreased pacemaker rate, and decreased pacemaker arrhythmogenesis. Conversely, the actual observed effects of hypokalemia include prolonged action potential duration, increased pacemaker rate, and increased pacemaker arrhythmogenesis. Furthermore, pacemaker rate and arrhythmias involving ectopic pacemaker cells appear to be more sensitive to changes in serum potassium concentration, compared with cells of the sinoatrial node. These effects of serum potassium on the heart probably contribute to the observed increased sensitivity to potassium channel-blocking antiarrhythmic agents (quinidine or sotalol) during hypokalemia, eg, accentuated action potential prolongation and tendency to cause torsade de pointes.

\section*{The Active Cell Membrane}

In normal atrial, Purkinje, and ventricular cells, the action potential upstroke (phase 0 ) is dependent on sodium current. From a functional point of view, it is convenient to describe the behavior of the sodium current in terms of three channel states (Figure 14-2). The cardiac sodium channel protein has been cloned, and it is now recognized that these channel states actually represent different protein conformations. In addition, regions of the protein that confer specific behaviors, such as voltage sensing, pore formation, and inactivation, are now being identified. The gates described below and in Figure 14-2 represent such regions.
Figure 14-2.

A schematic representation of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels cycling through different conformational states during the cardiac action potential. Transitions between resting, activated, and inactivated states are dependent on membrane potential and time. The activation gate is shown as $m$ and the inactivation gate as $h$. Potentials typical for each state are shown under each channel schematic as a function of time. The dashed line indicates that part of the action potential during which most $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels are completely or partially inactivated and unavailable for reactivation.

Depolarization to the threshold voltage results in opening of the activation (m) gates of sodium channels (Figure 14-2, middle). If the inactivation ( h ) gates of these channels have not already closed, the channels are now open or activated, and sodium permeability is markedly increased, greatly exceeding the permeability for any other ion. Extracellular sodium therefore diffuses down its electrochemical gradient into the cell, and the membrane potential very rapidly approaches the sodium equilibrium potential, $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{Na}}$ (about +70 mV when $\mathrm{Na}_{\mathrm{e}}=$ $140 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ and $\mathrm{Na}_{\mathrm{i}}=10 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). This intense sodium current is very brief because opening of the m gates upon depolarization is promptly followed by closure of the $h$ gates and inactivation of the sodium channels (Figure 14-2, right).

Most calcium channels become activated and inactivated in what appears to be the same way as sodium channels, but in the case of the most common type of cardiac calcium channel (the "L" type), the transitions occur more slowly and at more positive potentials. The action potential plateau (phases 1 and 2) reflects the turning off of most of the sodium current, the waxing and waning of calcium current, and the slow development of a repolarizing potassium current.

Final repolarization (phase 3) of the action potential results from completion of sodium and calcium channel inactivation and the growth of potassium permeability, so that the membrane potential once again approaches the potassium equilibrium potential. The major potassium currents involved in phase 3 repolarization include a rapidly activating potassium current ( $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Kr}}$ ) and a slowly activating potassium current ( $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Ks}}$ ). These two potassium currents are sometimes discussed together as " $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{K}}$." These processes are diagrammed in Figure 14-3. It is noteworthy that a different potassium current, distinct from $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Kr}}$ and $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Ks}}$, may control repolarization in sinoatrial nodal cells. This explains why some drugs that block either $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Kr}}$ or $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Ks}}$ may prolong repolarization in

Purkinje and ventricular cells, but have little effect on sinoatrial nodal repolarization (see Molecular \& Genetic Basis of Cardiac Arrhythmias).

Schematic diagram of the ion permeability changes and transport processes that occur during an action potential and the diastolic period following it. The size and weight of the arrows indicate approximate magnitudes of the ion channel currents; arrows pointing down indicate inward (depolarizing) membrane currents, arrows pointing up indicate outward (repolarizing) membrane currents. Multiple subtypes of potassium and calcium currents, with different sensitivities to blocking drugs, have been identified. Chloride currents (dotted arrows) produce both inward and outward membrane currents during the cardiac action potential.

\section*{MOLECULAR \& GENETIC BASIS OF CARDI AC ARRHYTHMI AS}

It is now possible to define the molecular basis of several congenital and acquired cardiac arrhythmias. The best example is the polymorphic ventricular tachycardia known as torsade de pointes (shown in Figure 14-7), which is associated with prolongation of the QT interval (especially at the onset of the tachycardia), syncope, and sudden death. This must represent prolongation of the action potential of at least some ventricular cells (Figure 14-1). The effect can, in theory, be attributed either to increased inward current (gain of function) or decreased outward current (loss of function) during the plateau of the action potential. In fact, recent molecular genetic studies have identified up to 300 different mutations in at least eight ion channel genes that produce the congenital long QT (LQT) syndrome (Table 14-1), and each mutation may have different clinical implications. Loss of function mutations in potassium channel genes produce decreases in outward repolarizing current and are responsible for LQT subtypes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7. HERG and KCNE2 (MiRP1 ) genes encode
subunits of the the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current ( $I_{\mathrm{Kr}}$ ), whereas KCNQ1 and KCNE1 (minK ) encode subunits of the slow delayed rectifier potassium current ( $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Ks}}$ ). KCNJ 2 encodes an inwardly rectifying potassium current ( $\mathrm{I}_{\text {Kir }}$ ). In contrast, gain of function mutations in the sodium channel gene (SCN5A) or calcium channel gene (CACNA1c ) cause increases in inward plateau current and are responsible for LQT subtypes 3 and 8, respectively.

Molecular genetic studies have identified the reason why congenital and acquired cases of torsades de pointes can be so strikingly similar. The potassium channel $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Kr}}$ (encoded by HERG) is blocked or modified by many drugs (eg, quinidine, sotalol) or electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia) that also produce torsades de pointes. Thus, the identification of the precise molecular mechanisms underlying various forms of the LQT syndromes now raises the possibility that specific therapies may be developed for individuals with defined molecular abnormalities. Indeed, preliminary reports suggest that the sodium channel blocker mexiletine can correct the clinical manifestations of congenital LQT subtype 3 syndrome. It is likely that torsade de pointes originates from triggered upstrokes arising from early afterdepolarizations (Figure 14-5). Thus, therapy is directed at correcting hypokalemia, eliminating triggered upstrokes (eg, by using Bblockers or magnesium), or shortening the action potential (eg, by increasing heart rate with isoproterenol or pacing)-or all of these.

The molecular basis of several other congenital cardiac arrhythmias associated with sudden death has also recently been identified. Three forms of short QT syndrome have been identified that are linked to gain of function mutations in three different potassium channel genes (KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2).
Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, a disease that is characterized by stress- or emotioninduced syncope, can be caused by genetic mutations in two different proteins in the sarcoplasmic reticulum that control intracellular calcium homeostasis. Mutations in two different ion channel genes (HCN4 and SCN5A ) have been linked to congenital forms of sick sinus syndrome. The Brugada syndrome, which is characterized by ventricular fibrillation associated with persistent ST-segment elevation, and progressive cardiac conduction disorder (PCCD), characterized by impaired conduction in the His-Purkinje system and right or left bundle block leading to complete atrioventricular block, have both been linked to several loss-of-function mutations in the sodium channel gene, SCN5A. At least one form of familial atrial fibrillation is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the potassium channel gene, KCNQ1 .

\section*{The Effect of Resting Potential on Action Potentials}

A key factor in the pathophysiology of arrhythmias and the actions of antiarrhythmic drugs is the relationship between the resting potential of a cell and the action potentials that can be evoked in it (Figure 14-4, left panel). Because the inactivation gates of sodium channels in the resting membrane close over the potential range -75 to -55 mV , fewer sodium channels are "available" for diffusion of sodium ions when an action
potential is evoked from a resting potential of -60 mV than when it is evoked from a resting potential of -80 mV . Important consequences of the reduction in peak sodium permeability include reduced maximum upstroke velocity (called $\dot{V}_{\text {max }}$, for maximum rate of change of membrane voltage), reduced action potential amplitude, reduced excitability, and reduced conduction velocity.
Figure 14-4.

Dependence of sodium channel function on the membrane potential preceding the stimulus. Left: The fraction of sodium channels available for opening in response to a stimulus is determined by the membrane potential immediately preceding the stimulus. The decrease in the fraction available when the resting potential is depolarized in the absence of a drug (control curve) results from the voltage-dependent closure of h gates in the channels. The curve labeled Drug illustrates the effect of a typical local anesthetic antiarrhythmic drug. Most sodium channels are inactivated during the plateau of the action potential. Right: The time constant for recovery from inactivation after repolarization also depends on the resting potential. In the absence of drug, recovery occurs in less than 10 ms at normal resting potentials ( -85 to -95 mV ). Depolarized cells recover more slowly (note logarithmic scale). In the presence of a sodium channel-blocking drug, the time constant of recovery is increased, but the increase is far greater at depolarized potentials than at more negative ones.

During the plateau of the action potential, most sodium channels are inactivated. Upon repolarization, recovery from inactivation takes place (in the terminology of Figure 14-2, the h gates reopen), making the channels again available for excitation. The time between phase 0 and sufficient recovery of sodium channels in phase 3 to permit a new propagated response to an external stimulus is the refractory period. Changes in refractoriness (determined by either altered recovery from inactivation or altered action potential duration) can be important in the genesis or suppression of certain arrhythmias. Another important effect of less negative resting potential is prolongation of this recovery time, as shown in Figure 14-4 (right panel). The prolongation of recovery time is reflected in an increase in the effective refractory period.

A brief, sudden, depolarizing stimulus, whether caused by a propagating action potential or by an external electrode arrangement, causes the opening of large numbers of activation gates before a significant number of inactivation gates can close. In contrast, slow reduction (depolarization) of the resting potential, whether brought about by hyperkalemia, sodium pump blockade, or ischemic cell damage, results in depressed sodium currents during the upstrokes of action potentials. Depolarization of the resting potential to levels positive to
-55 mV abolishes sodium currents, since all sodium channels are inactivated. However, such severely depolarized cells have been found to support special action potentials under circumstances that increase calcium permeability or decrease potassium permeability. These "slow responses"-slow upstroke velocity and slow conduction-depend on a calcium inward current and constitute the normal electrical activity in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, since these tissues have a normal resting potential in the range of - 50 to -70 mV . Slow responses may also be important for certain arrhythmias. Modern techniques of molecular biology and electrophysiology can identify multiple subtypes of calcium and potassium channels. One way in which such subtypes may differ is in sensitivity to drug effects, so drugs targeting specific channel subtypes may be developed in the future.

\section*{MECHANI SMS OF ARRHYTHMI AS}

Many factors can precipitate or exacerbate arrhythmias: ischemia, hypoxia, acidosis or alkalosis, electrolyte abnormalities, excessive catecholamine exposure, autonomic influences, drug toxicity (eg, digitalis or antiarrhythmic drugs), overstretching of cardiac fibers, and the presence of scarred or otherwise diseased tissue. However, all arrhythmias result from (1) disturbances in impulse formation, (2) disturbances in impulse conduction, or (3) both.

\section*{Disturbances of I mpulse Formation}

The interval between depolarizations of a pacemaker cell is the sum of the duration of the action potential and the duration of the diastolic interval. Shortening of either duration results in an increase in pacemaker rate. The more important of the two, diastolic interval, is determined primarily by the slope of phase 4 depolarization (pacemaker potential). Vagal discharge and B-receptor-blocking drugs slow normal pacemaker rate by reducing the phase 4 slope (acetylcholine also makes the maximum diastolic potential more negative). Acceleration of pacemaker discharge is often brought about by increased phase 4 depolarization slope, which can be caused by hypokalemia, B-adrenoceptor stimulation, positive chronotropic drugs, fiber stretch, acidosis, and partial depolarization by currents of injury.

Latent pacemakers (cells that show slow phase 4 depolarization even under normal conditions, eg, some Purkinje fibers) are particularly prone to acceleration by the above mechanisms. However, all cardiac cells, including normally quiescent atrial and ventricular cells, may show repetitive pacemaker activity when depolarized under appropriate conditions, especially if hypokalemia is also present.

Afterdepolarizations (Figure 14-5) are depolarizations that interrupt phase 3 (early afterdepolarizations, EADs) or phase 4 (delayed afterdepolarizations, DADs). EADs are usually exacerbated at slow heart rates and are thought to contribute to the development of long QT-related arrhythmias (see Molecular \& Genetic Basis of Cardiac Arrhythmias). DADs on the other hand, discussed in Chapter 13, often occur when intracellular calcium is increased. They are exacerbated by fast heart rates and are thought to be responsible for some arrhythmias related to digitalis excess, to catecholamines, and to myocardial ischemia.
Figure 14-5.

Two forms of abnormal activity, early (top) and delayed after depolarizations (bottom). In both cases, abnormal depolarizations arise during or after a normally evoked action potential. They are therefore often referred to as "triggered" automaticity; that is, they require a normal action potential for their initiation.

\section*{Disturbances of I mpulse Conduction}

Severely depressed conduction may result in simple block, eg, atrioventricular nodal block or bundle branch block. Because parasympathetic control of atrioventricular conduction is significant, partial atrioventricular block is sometimes relieved by atropine. Another common abnormality of conduction is reentry (also known as "circus movement"), in which one impulse reenters and excites areas of the heart more than once (Figure 14-6). The path of the reentering impulse may be confined to very small areas, eg, within or near the atrioventricular node, or it may involve large portions of the atrial or ventricular walls. Some forms of reentry are strictly anatomically determined; for example, in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, the reentry circuit consists of atrial tissue, the AV node, ventricular tissue, and an accessory atrioventricular connection (a "bypass tract"). In other cases (eg, atrial or ventricular fibrillation), multiple reentry circuits, determined by the properties of the cardiac tissue, may meander through the heart in apparently random paths.
Furthermore, the circulating impulse often gives off "daughter impulses" that can spread to the rest of the heart. Depending on how many round trips through the pathway the impulse makes before dying out, the arrhythmia may be manifest as one or a few extra beats or as a sustained tachycardia.
Figure 14-6.

\section*{B. Unidirectional block}

Copyright ©2006 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.
Schematic diagram of a reentry circuit that might occur in small bifurcating branches of the Purkinje system where they enter the ventricular wall. A: Normally, electrical excitation branches around the circuit, is transmitted to the ventricular branches, and becomes extinguished at the other end of the circuit due to collision of impulses. B: An area of unidirectional block develops in one of the branches, preventing anterograde impulse transmission at the site of block, but the retrograde impulse may be propagated through the site of block if the impulse finds excitable tissue; that is, the refractory period is shorter than the conduction time. This impulse will then reexcite tissue it had previously passed through, and a reentry arrhythmia will be established.

In order for reentry to occur, three conditions must coexist, as indicated in Figure 14-6: (1) There must be an obstacle (anatomic or physiologic) to homogeneous conduction, thus establishing a circuit around which the reentrant wavefront can propagate; (2) there must be unidirectional block at some point in the circuit, ie conduction must die out in one direction but continue in the opposite direction (as shown in Figure 14-6, the impulse can gradually decrease as it invades progressively more depolarized tissue until it finally blocks-a process known as decremental conduction); and (3) conduction time around the circuit must be long enough so that the retrograde impulse does not enter refractory tissue as it travels around the obstacle, ie the conduction time must exceed the effective refractory period. Importantly, reentry depends on conduction that has been depressed by some critical amount, usually as a result of injury or ischemia. If conduction velocity is too slow, bidirectional block rather than unidirectional block occurs; if the reentering impulse is too weak, conduction may fail, or the impulse may arrive so late that it collides with the next regular impulse. On the other hand, if conduction is too rapid, ie almost normal, bidirectional conduction rather than unidirectional block will occur. Even in the presence of unidirectional block, if the impulse travels around the obstacle too rapidly, it will reach tissue that is still refractory.

Slowing of conduction may be due to depression of sodium current, depression of calcium current (the latter especially in the atrioventricular node), or both. Drugs that abolish reentry usually work by further slowing depressed conduction (by blocking the sodium or calcium current) and causing bidirectional block. In theory, accelerating conduction (by increasing sodium or calcium current) would also be effective, but only under unusual circumstances does this mechanism explain the action of any available drug.

Lengthening (or shortening) of the refractory period may also make reentry less likely. The longer the refractory period in tissue near the site of block, the greater the chance that the tissue will still be refractory when reentry is attempted. (Alternatively, the shorter the refractory period in the depressed region, the less likely it is that unidirectional block will occur.) Thus, increased dispersion of refractoriness is one contributor to reentry, and drugs may suppress arrhythmias by reducing such dispersion.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF THE ANTI ARRHYTHMI C AGENTS}

\section*{Mechanisms of Action}

Arrhythmias are caused by abnormal pacemaker activity or abnormal impulse propagation. Thus, the aim of therapy of the arrhythmias is to reduce ectopic pacemaker activity and modify conduction or refractoriness in reentry circuits to disable circus movement. The major mechanisms currently available for accomplishing these goals are (1) sodium channel blockade, (2) blockade of sympathetic autonomic effects in the heart, (3) prolongation of the effective refractory period, and (4) calcium channel blockade.

Antiarrhythmic drugs decrease the automaticity of ectopic pacemakers more than that of the sinoatrial node. They also reduce conduction and excitability and increase the refractory period to a greater extent in depolarized tissue than in normally polarized tissue. This is accomplished chiefly by selectively blocking the sodium or calcium channels of depolarized cells (Figure 14-8). Therapeutically useful channel-blocking drugs bind readily to activated channels (ie, during phase 0 ) or inactivated channels (ie, during phase 2 ) but bind poorly or not at all to rested channels. Therefore, these drugs block electrical activity when there is a fast tachycardia (many channel activations and inactivations per unit time) or when there is significant loss of resting potential (many inactivated channels during rest). This type of drug action is often described as usedependent or state-dependent; that is, channels that are being used frequently, or in an inactivated state, are more susceptible to block. Channels in normal cells that become blocked by a drug during normal activation-inactivation cycles will rapidly lose the drug from the receptors during the resting portion of the cycle (Figure 14-8). Channels in myocardium that is chronically depolarized (ie, has a resting potential more positive than -75 mV ) will recover from block very slowly if at all (see also right panel, Figure 14-4).
Figure 14-8.

Diagram of a mechanism for the selective depressant action of antiarrhythmic drugs on sodium channels. The upper portion of the figure shows the population of channels moving through a cycle of activity during an action potential in the absence of drugs: R (rested) $\rightarrow$ A (activated) $\rightarrow \mathrm{I}$ (inactivated). Recovery takes place via the I $\rightarrow \mathrm{R}$ pathway. Antiarrhythmic drugs (D) that act by blocking sodium channels can bind to their receptors in the channels, as shown by the vertical arrows, to form drug-channel complexes, indicated as R-D, A-D, and I-D. Binding of the drugs to the receptor varies with the state of the channel. The data available for a variety of sodium channel blockers indicate that the binding of the drugs to the active and
inactivated channel receptor is much greater than the binding to the rested channel. Furthermore, recovery from the I-D state to the R-D state is much slower than from I to R. As a result, rapid activity (more activations and inactivations) and depolarization of the resting potential (more channels in the I state) will favor blockade of the channels and selectively suppress arrhythmic cells.

In cells with abnormal automaticity, most of these drugs reduce the phase 4 slope by blocking either sodium or calcium channels, thereby reducing the ratio of sodium (or calcium) permeability to potassium permeability. As a result, the membrane potential during phase 4 stabilizes closer to the potassium equilibrium potential. In addition, some agents may increase the threshold (make it more positive). Beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs indirectly reduce the phase 4 slope by blocking the positive chronotropic action of norepinephrine in the heart.

In reentry arrhythmias, which depend on critically depressed conduction, most antiarrhythmic agents slow conduction further by one or both of two mechanisms: (1) steady-state reduction in the number of available unblocked channels, which reduces the excitatory currents to a level below that required for propagation (Figure 14-4, left); and (2) prolongation of recovery time of the channels still able to reach the rested and available state, which increases the effective refractory period (Figure 14-4, right). As a result, early extrasystoles are unable to propagate at all; later impulses propagate more slowly and are subject to bidirectional conduction block.

By these mechanisms, antiarrhythmic drugs can suppress ectopic automaticity and abnormal conduction occurring in depolarized cells—rendering them electrically silent—while minimally affecting the electrical activity in normally polarized parts of the heart. However, as dosage is increased, these agents also depress conduction in normal tissue, eventually resulting in drug-induced arrhythmias. Furthermore, a drug concentration that is therapeutic (antiarrhythmic) under the initial circumstances of treatment may become "proarrhythmic" (arrhythmogenic) during fast heart rates (more development of block), acidosis (slower recovery from block for most drugs), hyperkalemia, or ischemia.

\section*{SPECI FIC ANTI ARRHYTHMI C AGENTS}

The most widely used scheme for the classification of antiarrhythmic drug actions recognizes four classes:
1. Class 1 action is sodium channel blockade. Subclasses of this action reflect effects on the action potential duration (APD) and the kinetics of sodium channel blockade. Drugs with class 1A action prolong the APD and dissociate from the channel with intermediate kinetics; drugs with class 1B action shorten the APD in some tissues of the heart and dissociate from the channel with rapid kinetics; and drugs with class 1C action have minimal effects on the APD and dissociate from the channel with slow kinetics.
2. Class 2 action is sympatholytic. Drugs with this action reduce $B$-adrenergic activity in the heart.
3. Class 3 action is manifest by prolongation of the APD. Most drugs with this action block the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Kr}}$.
4. Class 4 action is blockade of the cardiac calcium current. This action slows conduction in regions where the action potential upstroke is calcium dependent, eg, the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes.

A given drug may have multiple classes of action as indicated by its membrane and electrocardiographic (ECG) effects (Tables 14-2 and 14-3). For example, amiodarone shares all four classes of action. Drugs are usually discussed according to the predominant class of action. Certain antiarrhythmic agents, eg, adenosine and magnesium, do not fit readily into this scheme and are described separately.
Table 14-2. Membrane Actions of Antiarrhythmic Drugs.
