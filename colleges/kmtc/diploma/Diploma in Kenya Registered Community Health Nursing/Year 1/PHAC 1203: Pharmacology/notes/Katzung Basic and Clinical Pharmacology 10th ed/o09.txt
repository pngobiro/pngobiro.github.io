\section*{CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY: I NTRODUCTION}

Cancer is a disease characterized by a shift in the control mechanisms that govern cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Cells that have undergone neoplastic transformation usually express cell surface antigens that may be of normal fetal type, may display other signs of apparent immaturity, and may exhibit qualitative or quantitative chromosomal abnormalities, including various translocations and the appearance of amplified gene sequences. Such cells proliferate excessively and form local tumors that can compress or invade adjacent normal structures. A small subpopulation of cells within the tumor can be described as tumor stem cells. They retain the ability to undergo repeated cycles of proliferation as well as to migrate to distant sites in the body to colonize various organs in the process called metastasis. Such tumor stem cells thus can express clonogenic or colony-forming capability. Tumor stem cells are characterized by chromosome abnormalities reflecting their genetic instability, which leads to progressive selection of subclones that can survive more readily in the multicellular environment of the host. Quantitative abnormalities in various metabolic pathways and cellular components accompany this neoplastic progression. The invasive and metastatic processes as well as a series of metabolic abnormalities resulting from the cancer cause illness and eventual death of the patient unless the neoplasm can be eradicated with treatment.

\section*{CAUSES OF CANCER}

The incidence, geographic distribution, and behavior of specific types of cancer are related to multiple factors, including sex, age, race, genetic predisposition, and exposure to environmental carcinogens. Of these factors, environmental exposure is probably most important. Exposure to ionizing radiation has been well established to be a significant risk factor for a number of cancers, including acute leukemias, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, and basal cell skin cancers. Chemical carcinogens (particularly those in tobacco smoke) as well as azo dyes, aflatoxins, asbestos, benzene, and radon have been clearly implicated in cancer induction in humans and animals. Identification of potential carcinogens in the environment has been greatly simplified by the widespread use of the Ames test for mutagenic agents. Ninety percent of carcinogens can be shown to be mutagenic with this assay. Ultimate identification of potential human carcinogens, however, requires testing in at least two animal species.

Viruses have been implicated as the etiologic agents of several human cancers. Expression of virus-induced neoplasia probably also depends on additional host and environmental factors that modulate the transformation process. Cellular genes are known that are homologous to the transforming genes of the retroviruses, a family of RNA viruses, and induce oncogenic transformation. These mammalian cellular genes, known as oncogenes, have been shown to code for specific growth factors and their receptors and may be amplified (increased number of gene copies) or modified by a single nucleotide in malignant cells. The bcl-2 oncogene may be a generalized cell death suppressor gene that directly regulates apoptosis, a pathway of programmed cell death.

Another class of genes, tumor suppressor genes, may be deleted or damaged, with resulting neoplastic change. The p53 gene has been shown to be mutated in up to $50 \%$ of all human solid tumors, including liver, breast, colon, lung, cervix, bladder, prostate, and skin. The normal wild form of this gene appears to play an important role in suppressing neoplastic transformation; mutations in this gene place the cell at high risk.

\section*{CANCER THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES}

In 2005, cancer was the most common cause of death from disease in the USA, causing over 500,000 fatalities. With present methods of treatment, one third of patients are cured with local modalities (surgery or radiation therapy), which are quite effective if the tumor has not metastasized by the time of treatment. Earlier diagnosis might lead to increased cure rates with such local treatment; however, in the remaining cases, early micrometastasis is a characteristic feature of the neoplasm, indicating that a systemic approach such as chemotherapy is required (often along with surgery or radiation) for effective cancer management. At present, about $50 \%$ of patients who initially are diagnosed with cancer can be cured. However, chemotherapy is able to cure only about 10-15\% of all cancer patients.

Cancer chemotherapy, as currently employed, can be curative in certain disseminated neoplasms that have undergone either gross or microscopic spread by the time of diagnosis. These cancers include germ cell cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and choriocarcinoma as well as childhood cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Burkitt's lymphoma, Wilms' tumor, and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. In an increasing number of cancers, the use of chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy followed by surgery can increase the cure rate; these include locally advanced bladder cancer, breast cancer, esophageal cancer, head and neck cancer, rectal cancer, and osteogenic sarcoma.

In patients with widespread disseminated disease, chemotherapy provides only palliative rather than curative therapy at present. Effective palliation results in temporary improvement of the symptoms and
signs of cancer and enhancement in the overall quality of life. In the past decade, advances in cancer chemotherapy have also begun to provide evidence that chemical control of neoplasia may become a reality for many forms of cancer. This will probably be achieved through a combined-modality approach in which optimal combinations of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are used to eradicate both the primary neoplasm and its occult micrometastases before gross spread can be detected on physical or x-ray examination. Use of hormonal agents to modulate tumor growth is playing an increasing role in hormoneresponsive tumors thanks to the development of hormone antagonists and partial agonists. Several recombinant biologic agents have been identified as being active for cancer therapy, including certain cytokines.

\section*{ANTI CANCER DRUG DEVELOPMENT}

A major effort to develop anticancer drugs through both empiric screening and rational design of new compounds has been under way for over 3 decades. The drug development program has employed testing in a few well-characterized transplantable animal tumor systems. Simple in vitro assays for measuring drug sensitivity of a battery of human tumor cells augment and shorten the testing program and are used currently as the primary screening tests for new agents. New drugs with potential anticancer activity are subjected to preclinical toxicologic and limited pharmacologic studies in animals as described in Chapter 5. Promising agents that do not have excessive toxicity are then advanced to phase I clinical trials, wherein their pharmacologic and toxic effects are usually tested in patients with advanced cancer. Other features of clinical testing are similar to the procedure for other drugs but may be accelerated.

Under ideal circumstances, anticancer drugs would eradicate cancer cells without harming normal tissues. Unfortunately, no agents currently available are completely devoid of toxicity, and clinical use of these drugs involves a weighing of benefits against toxicity in a search for a favorable therapeutic index.

Classes of drugs that have recently entered clinical development include signal transduction inhibitors, focused on critical signaling pathways essential for cell growth and proliferation; microtubule inhibitors, directed against the mitotic spindle apparatus; differentiation agents, intended to force neoplastic cells past a maturation block to form end-stage cells with little or no proliferative potential; antimetastatic drugs, designed to perturb surface properties of malignant cells and thus reduce their invasive and metastatic potential; antiangiogenic agents, designed to inhibit the formation of tumor vasculature; hypoxic tumor stem cell-specific agents, designed to exploit the greater capacity for reductive reactions in these often therapeutically resistant cells; tumor radiosensitizing and normal tissue radioprotecting drugs, aimed at increased therapeutic effectiveness of radiation therapy; cytoprotective agents, focused on protecting certain normal tissues against the toxic effects of chemotherapy; and biologic response modifiers, which alter tumor-host metabolic and immunologic relationships.

\section*{I MPORTANCE OF NEOPLASTI C CELL BURDEN}

Patients with widespread cancer may have up to $10^{12}$ tumor cells throughout the body at the time of diagnosis (Figure 55-1). If tolerable dosing of an effective drug is capable of killing 99.99\% (ie, $10^{4}$ ) of clonogenic tumor cells, treatment would induce a clinical remission of the neoplasm associated with symptomatic improvement. However, there would still be up to 8 "logs" of tumor cells ( $10^{8}$ ) remaining in the body, including those that might be inherently resistant to the drug because of tumor heterogeneity. There may also be other tumor cells that reside in pharmacologic sanctuary sites (eg, the central nervous system, testes), where effective drug concentrations may be difficult to achieve. When cell cycle-specific
drugs are used, the tumor stem cells must also be in the sensitive phase of the cell cycle (not in $\mathrm{G}_{0}$ ). For this reason, scheduling of these agents is particularly important. In common bacterial infections, a threelog reduction in microorganisms might be curative because host resistance factors can eliminate residual bacteria through immunologic and microbicidal mechanisms; however, host mechanisms for eliminating even moderate numbers of cancer cells appear to be generally ineffective.

The log-kill hypothesis. Relationship of tumor cell number to time of diagnosis, symptoms, treatment, and survival. Three alternative approaches to drug treatment are shown for comparison with the course of tumor growth when no treatment is given (dashed line ). In the protocol diagrammed at top, treatment (indicated by the arrows) is given infrequently and the result is manifested as prolongation of survival but with recurrence of symptoms between courses of treatment and eventual death of the patient. The combination chemotherapy treatment diagrammed in the middle section is begun earlier and is more intensive. Tumor cell kill exceeds regrowth, drug resistance does not develop, and "cure" results. In this example, treatment has been continued long after all clinical evidence of cancer has disappeared (1-3 years). This approach has been established as effective in the treatment of childhood acute leukemia, testicular cancers, and Hodgkin's disease. In the treatment diagrammed near the bottom of the graph, early surgery has been employed to remove the primary tumor and intensive adjuvant chemotherapy has been administered long enough (up to 1 year) to eradicate the remaining tumor cells that comprise the occult micrometastases.

Combinations of agents with differing toxicities and mechanisms of action are often employed to overcome the limited log kill of individual anticancer drugs. If drugs display nonoverlapping toxicities, they can be used at almost full dosage, and at least additive cytotoxic effects can be achieved with combination chemotherapy; furthermore, subclones resistant to only one of the agents can potentially be eradicated.

Some combinations of anticancer drugs also appear to exert true synergism, wherein the effect of the two drugs is greater than additive. The efficacy of combination chemotherapy has now been validated in many human cancers, and combination chemotherapy is now the standard approach to curative treatment of testicular cancer and lymphomas and to palliative treatment of many other tumor types. This important therapeutic approach was first formulated by Skipper and Schabel and described as the log-kill hypothesis (Figure 55-1).

The growth of acute leukemias and aggressive high-grade lymphomas closely follows exponential cell kinetics. In contrast, most human solid tumors do not grow in such a manner; instead, they follow a Gompertzian model of tumor growth and regression. Under Gompertzian kinetics, the growth fraction of the tumor is not constant and peaks when the tumor is about one third of its maximum size.

\section*{I MPORTANCE OF CELL CYCLE KI NETI CS}

Information on cell and population kinetics of cancer cells explains, in part, the limited effectiveness of most available anticancer drugs. A schematic summary of cell cycle kinetics is presented in Figure 55-2. This information is relevant to the mode of action, indications, and scheduling of cell cycle-specific (CCS) and cell cycle-nonspecific (CCNS) drugs. Agents falling into these two major classes are summarized in Table 55-1.

Figure 55-2.

The cell cycle and cancer. A conceptual depiction of the cell cycle phases that all cells-normal and neoplastic-must traverse before and during cell division. The percentages given represent the approximate percentage of time spent in each phase by a typical malignant cell; the duration of $\mathrm{G}_{1}$, however, can vary markedly. Many of the effective anticancer drugs exert their action on cells traversing the cell cycle and are called cell cycle-specific (CCS) drugs (Table 55-1). A second group of agents called cell cycle-nonspecific (CCNS) drugs can sterilize tumor cells whether they are cycling or resting in the $\mathrm{G}_{0}$ compartment. CCNS drugs can kill both $\mathrm{G}_{0}$ and cycling cells (although cycling cells are more sensitive).

In general, CCS drugs are most effective in hematologic malignancies and in solid tumors in which a relatively large proportion of the cells are proliferating or are in the growth fraction. CCNS drugs (many of which bind to cellular DNA and damage these macromolecules) are particularly useful in low growth fraction solid tumors as well as in high growth fraction tumors. In all instances, effective agents sterilize or inactivate tumor stem cells, which are often only a small fraction of the cells within a tumor. Non-stem cells (eg, those that have irreversibly differentiated) are considered sterile by definition and are not a significant component of the cancer problem.

\section*{Resistance to Cytotoxic Drugs}

A major problem in cancer chemotherapy is the development of cellular drug resistance. Some tumor types, eg, malignant melanoma, renal cell cancer, and brain cancer, exhibit primary resistance, ie, absence of response on the first exposure, to currently available standard agents. The presence of inherent drug resistance is thought to be tightly associated with the genomic instability associated with the development of most cancers. Acquired resistance develops in a number of drug-sensitive tumor types. Experimentally, drug resistance can be highly specific to a single drug and usually is based on a change in the genetic apparatus of a given tumor cell with amplification or increased expression of one or more specific genes. In other instances, a multidrug-resistant phenotype occurs-resistance to a variety of natural product
anticancer drugs of differing structures developing after exposure to a single agent. This form of multidrug resistance is often associated with increased expression of a normal gene (the MDR1 gene) for a cell surface glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein) involved in drug efflux. This transport molecule requires ATP to expel a variety of foreign molecules (not limited to antitumor drugs) from the cell. It is expressed constitutively in normal tissues such as the epithelial cells of the kidney, large intestine, and adrenal gland as well as in a variety of tumors. Multidrug resistance can be reversed experimentally by calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, and a variety of other drugs, which inhibit the transporter. Other mechanisms of multiple drug resistance involve overexpression of the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), a member of the ATP-binding cassette transmembrane transporter superfamily that now consists of nine members (MRP1-MRP9). MRP1, the most extensively studied, increases resistance to natural product drugs such as anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and epipodophyllotoxins by functioning as a drug export pump.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF CANCER CHEMOTHERAPEUTI C DRUGS Polyfunctional Alkylating Agents}

The major clinically useful alkylating agents (Figure 55-3) have a structure containing a bis(chloroethyl)amine, ethyleneimine, or nitrosourea moiety. Among the bis(chloroethyl)amines, cyclophosphamide, mechlorethamine, melphalan, and chlorambucil are the most useful. Ifosfamide is closely related to cyclophosphamide but has a somewhat different spectrum of activity and toxicity. Thiotepa and busulfan are used for specialized purposes for ovarian cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia, respectively. The major nitrosoureas are carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU), and semustine (methylCCNU). A variety of investigational alkylating agents have been synthesized that link various carrier molecules such as amino acids, nucleic acid bases, hormones, or sugar moieties to a group capable of alkylation; however, successful site-directed alkylation has not been achieved to date.

Structures of major classes of alkylating agents.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

As a class, the alkylating agents exert their cytotoxic effects via transfer of their alkyl groups to various cellular constituents. Alkylations of DNA within the nucleus probably represent the major interactions that lead to cell death. However, these drugs react chemically with sulfhydryl, amino, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and phosphate groups of other cellular nucleophiles as well. The general mechanism of action of these drugs involves intramolecular cyclization to form an ethyleneimonium ion that may directly or through formation of a carbonium ion transfer an alkyl group to a cellular constituent. In addition to alkylation, a secondary mechanism that occurs with nitrosoureas involves carbamoylation of lysine residues of proteins through formation of isocyanates.

The major site of alkylation within DNA is the N7 position of guanine (Figure 55-4); however, other bases are also alkylated to lesser degrees, including N1 and N3 of adenine, N3 of cytosine, and O6 of guanine, as
well as phosphate atoms and proteins associated with DNA. These interactions can occur on a single strand or on both strands of DNA through cross-linking, as most major alkylating agents are bifunctional, with two reactive groups. Alkylation of guanine can result in miscoding through abnormal base pairing with thymine or in depurination by excision of guanine residues. The latter effect leads to DNA strand breakage through scission of the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA. Cross-linking of DNA appears to be of major importance to the cytotoxic action of alkylating agents, and replicating cells are most susceptible to these drugs. Thus, although alkylating agents are not cell cycle-specific, cells are most susceptible to alkylation in late $G_{1}$ and S phases of the cell cycle and express block in $\mathrm{G}_{2}$.

Mechanism of alkylation of DNA guanine. A bis(chloroethyl)amine forms an ethyleneimonium ion and a carbonium ion that react with a base such as N7 of guanine in DNA, producing an alkylated purine. Alkylation of a second guanine residue, through the illustrated mechanism, results in cross-linking of DNA strands.

\section*{Drug Resistance}

The mechanism of acquired resistance to alkylating agents may involve increased capability to repair DNA lesions, decreased permeability of the cell to the alkylating drug, and increased production of glutathione, which inactivates the alkylating agent through conjugation or through increased glutathione S- transferase activity, which catalyzes the conjugation.

\section*{Pharmacologic Effects}

Alkylating agents have direct vesicant effects and can damage tissues at the site of injection as well as produce systemic toxicity. Toxicities are generally dose related and occur particularly in rapidly growing tissues such as bone marrow, the gastrointestinal tract, and the reproductive system. After intravenous injection, nausea and vomiting usually occur within 30-60 minutes with mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, or carmustine. The emetogenic effects are mediated by the central nervous system and
can be reduced by pretreatment with 5-HT3 (serotonin) receptor antagonists such as ondansetron or granisetron.

Cyclophosphamide is inactive in its parent form, and must be activated to cytotoxic forms by liver microsomal enzymes (Figure 55-5). The cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidase system converts cyclophosphamide to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, which is in equilibrium with aldophosphamide. These active metabolites are believed to be delivered by the bloodstream to both tumor and normal tissue, where nonenzymatic cleavage of aldophosphamide to the cytotoxic forms-phosphoramide mustard and acrolein-occurs. The liver appears to be protected through the enzymatic formation of the inactive metabolites 4-ketocyclophosphamide and carboxyphosphamide.

Oral administration of alkylating agents has been of great clinical value. Cyclophosphamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, busulfan, and, more recently, temozolomide are those most commonly given via the oral route, and their cytotoxic effects are similar to those observed with parenteral administration. In general, if a tumor is resistant to one alkylating agent, it will be relatively resistant to other agents of this class (though not necessarily to nitrosoureas); however, there are exceptions to this rule depending on the specific tumor. Cyclophosphamide is the most widely used alkylating agent. The oral drug busulfan has a major degree of specificity for the granulocyte series and is therefore of particular value in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. With all oral alkylating agents, some degree of leukopenia is necessary to provide evidence that the drug has been absorbed adequately. Frequent monitoring of blood counts is essential during administration of these agents as the development of severe leukopenia or thrombocytopenia necessitates immediate interruption of therapy.

\section*{NITROSOUREAS}

These drugs appear to be non-cross-resistant with other alkylating agents; all require biotransformation, which occurs by nonenzymatic decomposition, to metabolites with both alkylating and carbamoylating activities. The nitrosoureas are highly lipid-soluble and are able to cross the blood-brain barrier, making them useful in the treatment of brain tumors. Although the majority of alkylations by the nitrosoureas are on the N7 position of guanine in DNA, the critical alkylation responsible for cytotoxicity is on the O6 of guanine, which leads to G-C crosslinks in DNA. After oral administration of lomustine, peak plasma levels of metabolites appear within 1-4 hours; central nervous system concentrations reach $30-40 \%$ of the activity present in the plasma. While the initial plasma half-life is approximately 6 hours, a second half-life is $1-2$ days. Urinary excretion appears to be the major route of elimination from the body. One naturally occurring sugar-containing nitrosourea, streptozocin, is interesting because it has minimal bone marrow toxicity. This
agent has activity in the treatment of insulin-secreting islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas.

\section*{RELATED DRUGS ACTING AS ALKYLATING AGENTS}

A variety of other compounds have mechanisms of action that involve alkylation. These include procarbazine, dacarbazine, altretamine (hexamethylmelamine), cisplatin, and carboplatin. Dosages and major toxicities are listed in Table 55-2.

\section*{Procarbazine}

The oral agent procarbazine is a methylhydrazine derivative, and it is commonly used in combination regimens for Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and brain tumors. This drug has leukemogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic properties.

The precise mechanism of action of procarbazine is uncertain; however, the drug inhibits DNA, RNA, and protein biosynthesis; prolongs interphase; and produces chromosome breaks. Oxidative metabolism of this drug by microsomal enzymes generates azoprocarbazine and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, which may be responsible for DNA strand scission. A variety of other drug metabolites are formed that may be cytotoxic. One metabolite is a weak monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, and adverse effects can occur when procarbazine is given with other MAO inhibitors.

There is an increased risk of secondary cancers in the form of acute leukemia, and the carcinogenic potential of procarbazine is thought to be higher than that of most other alkylating agents.

\section*{Dacarbazine}

Dacarbazine is a synthetic compound that functions as an alkylating agent following metabolic activation by liver microsomal enzymes by oxidative N -demethylation to the monomethyl derivative. This metabolite spontaneously decomposes to 5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide, which is excreted in the urine, and diazomethane. The diazomethane generates a methyl carbonium ion that is believed to be the cytotoxic species. Dacarbazine is administered parenterally and is not schedule-dependent. It produces marked nausea, vomiting, and myelosuppression. Its major applications are in melanoma, Hodgkin's disease, and soft tissue sarcomas.

\section*{Altretamine}

Altretamine (Hexamethylmelamine) is structurally similar to triethylenemelamine. It is relatively insoluble and available only in oral form. It is rapidly biotransformed in the liver by demethylation to the pentamethylmelamine and tetramethylmelamine metabolites. This agent is approved for use in ovarian cancer patients who have progressed despite treatment with a regimen based on platinum or an alkylating agent (or both). The main dose-limiting toxicities include nausea, vomiting, and myelosuppression. Neurotoxicity in the form of somnolence, mood changes, and peripheral neuropathy is also observed.

\section*{Platinum Analogs}

Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum [II]) is an inorganic metal complex discovered through the serendipitous observation that neutral platinum complexes inhibited division and induced filamentous growth of Escherichia coli. Several platinum analogs have been subsequently synthesized. Although the precise mechanism of action of cisplatin is still undefined, it is thought to exert its cytotoxic effects in the same manner as alkylating agents. It kills cells in all stages of the cell cycle, binds DNA through the formation of intrastrand and interstrand cross-links, and inhibits DNA synthesis and function. The primary
binding site is the N7 position of guanine, but covalent interaction with adenine and cytosine also occurs. The platinum complexes appear to synergize with certain other anticancer drugs. Aggressive hydration with intravenous saline infusion has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of nephrotoxicity.

Cisplatin

Cisplatin has major antitumor activity in a broad range of solid tumors, including non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, esophageal and gastric cancer, head and neck cancer, and genitourinary cancers, particularly testicular, ovarian, and bladder cancer. When used in combination regimens with vinblastine and bleomycin or etoposide and bleomycin, cisplatin-based therapy has led to the cure of nonseminomatous testicular cancer.

Carboplatin is a second-generation platinum analog that exerts its cytotoxic effects exactly as cisplatin and has activity against the same spectrum of solid tumors. Its main dose-limiting toxicity is myelosuppression, and it has significantly less renal toxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity than cisplatin. Intravenous hydration is not required, and for this reason, carboplatin has now widely replaced cisplatin in combination chemotherapy regimens.

Oxaliplatin is a third-generation diaminocyclohexane platinum analog. Its mechanism of action is identical to that of cisplatin and carboplatin. However, cancer cells that are resistant to cisplatin or carboplatin on the basis of mismatch repair defects are not cross-resistant to oxaliplatin. This agent was originally approved for use as second-line therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer following treatment with the combination of 5 -fluorouracil and leucovorin ( $5-$ FU/LV) - the FOLFOX regimen. The FOLFOX regimen has now become the most widely used regimen in the first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, and it is now widely used in the adjuvant therapy of stage III colon cancer. Neurotoxicity is dose-limiting and characterized by a peripheral sensory neuropathy. There are two forms of neurotoxicity, an acute form that is often triggered and worsened by exposure to cold, and a chronic form that is dose-dependent. Although this chronic form is cumulative in nature, it tends to be reversible, in sharp contrast to cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity.

\section*{Antimetabolites}

The development of drugs with actions on intermediary metabolism of proliferating cells has been important both conceptually and clinically. While biochemical properties unique to all cancer cells have yet to be discovered, neoplastic cells do have a number of quantitative differences in metabolism from normal cells that render them more susceptible to a number of antimetabolites or structural analogs. Many of these agents have been rationally designed and synthesized based on knowledge of critical cellular processes involved in DNA biosynthesis.

\section*{Mechanisms of Action}

The biochemical pathways that have thus far proved to be most vulnerable to antimetabolites have been those relating to nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis. In a number of instances, when an enzyme is known to have a major effect on pathways leading to cell replication, inhibitors of the reaction it catalyzes have proved to be useful anticancer drugs.

These drugs and their doses and toxicities are shown in Table 55-3. The principal drugs are discussed below.

\section*{METHOTREXATE}

Methotrexate (MTX) is a folic acid antagonist that binds to the active catalytic site of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), interfering with the synthesis of the reduced form that accepts one-carbon units. Lack of this cofactor interrupts the de novo synthesis of thymidylate, purine nucleotides, and the amino acids serine and methionine, thereby interfering with the formation of DNA, RNA, and key cellular proteins. DHFR binds methotrexate with high affinity, and at pH 6.0, virtually no dissociation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex occurs (inhibition constant about 1 nM ). At physiologic pH , reversible competitive kinetics occur (inhibition constant about $1 \mu \mathrm{M}$ ). Intracellular formation of polyglutamate derivatives is critically important for the therapeutic action of methotrexate, and this process is mediated by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS). MTX polyglutamates are selectively retained within cancer cells, and they display increased inhibitory effects on enzymes involved in folate metabolism, making them important determinants of the duration of action of methotrexate.

\section*{Drug Resistance}

Resistance to methotrexate has been attributed to (1) decreased drug transport, (2) decreased formation of cytotoxic MTX polyglutamates, (3) synthesis of increased levels of DHFR through gene amplification, and (4) altered DHFR with reduced affinity for methotrexate. Recent studies have also suggested that decreased accumulation of drug through activation of the multidrug resistance P170 glycoprotein transporter may also result in drug resistance.

Methotrexate

\section*{Dosage \& Toxicity}

Methotrexate is administered by the intravenous, intrathecal, or oral route. Up to $90 \%$ of an oral dose is excreted in the urine within 12 hours. The drug is not subject to metabolism, and serum levels are therefore proportionate to dose as long as renal function and hydration status are adequate. Dosages and toxic effects are listed in Table 55-3. The effects of methotrexate can be reversed by administration of the reduced folate leucovorin (5-formyltetrahydrofolate). Leucovorin rescue is generally used in conjunction with high-dose methotrexate therapy to rescue normal cells from undue toxicity and it has also been used in cases of accidental drug overdose.

\section*{PEMETREXED}

Pemetrexed is a pyrrolopyrimidine antifolate analog with activity in the $S$ phase of the cell cycle. As in the case of MTX, it is transported into the cell via the reduced folate carrier and requires activation by the enzyme FPGS to yield higher polyglutamate forms. While this agent targets DHFR and enzymes involved in de novo purine nucleotide synthesis, its main site of action is via inhibition of thymidylate synthase. At present, this antifolate is approved for use in combination with cisplatin in the treatment of mesothelioma and as a single agent in the second-line therapy of non-small cell lung cancer. The main adverse effects are outlined in Table 55-3 and include myelosuppression, skin rash, mucositis, diarrhea, and fatigue.

\section*{PURINE ANTAGONISTS}

\section*{6-Thiopurines}

6-Mercaptopurine ( $\mathbf{6 - M P}$ ) was the first of the thiopurine analogs found to be effective in cancer therapy. As with other thiopurines, it is inactive in its parent form and must be metabolized by hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) to the monophosphate nucleotide 6 -thioinosinic acid, which in turn inhibits several enzymes of de novo purine nucleotide synthesis. Significant levels of thioguanylic acid
and 6-methylmercaptopurine ribotide (MMPR) are also formed from 6-MP. These metabolites also contribute to its cytotoxic action. 6-MP is used primarily in the treatment of childhood acute leukemia, and a closely related analog, azathioprine, is used as an immunosuppressive agent (see Chapter 56).

6-Thioguanine (6-TG) inhibits several enzymes in the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway. Various metabolic lesions result, including inhibition of purine nucleotide interconversion; decrease in intracellular levels of guanine nucleotides, which leads to inhibition of glycoprotein synthesis; interference with the formation of DNA and RNA; and incorporation of thiopurine nucleotides into both DNA and RNA. 6TG has a synergistic action when used together with cytarabine in the treatment of adult acute leukemia.

\section*{Drug Resistance}

Resistance to both 6-MP and 6-TG occurs most commonly by decreased expression of the activating enzyme (HGPRT); an alternative mechanism in acute leukemia involves increased expression or activity of the catabolic enzyme alkaline phosphatase, which results in dephosphorylation of thiopurine nucleotides and cellular loss of the resulting ribonucleoside. In addition, increased expression of thiopurine methyltransferase (TMPT) has been observed in thiopurine-resistant acute leukemic cells.

\section*{Dosage \& Toxicity}

6-MP and 6-TG are both given orally (Table 55-3) and excreted mainly in the urine. However, 6-MP is converted to an inactive metabolite (6-thiouric acid) by an oxidation catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, whereas 6-TG requires deamination before it is metabolized by this enzyme. This factor is important because the purine analog allopurinol, a potent xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is frequently used with chemotherapy in hematologic cancers to prevent hyperuricemia after tumor cell lysis. It does so by blocking purine oxidation, allowing excretion of cellular purines that are relatively more soluble than uric acid. Nephrotoxicity and acute gout produced by excessive uric acid are thereby prevented. Simultaneous therapy with allopurinol and 6-MP results in excessive toxicity unless the dose of mercaptopurine is reduced to $25 \%$ of the usual level. This effect does not occur with 6-TG, which can be used in full doses with allopurinol.

\section*{Fludarabine}

Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2-fluoro-arabinofuranosyladenosine and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the triphosphate. The triphosphate metabolite interferes with the processes of DNA synthesis and DNA repair through inhibition of DNA polymerase-c. and DNA polymerase-B. The triphosphate form can also be directly incorporated into DNA, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and function. The diphosphate metabolite of fludarabine inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, leading to inhibition of essential deoxyribonucleotidetriphosphates. Finally, fludarabine induces the process of apoptosis through as yet undetermined mechanisms. Fludarabine is used chiefly in the treatment of lowgrade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It is given parentally and is excreted primarily in the urine; its dose-limiting toxicity is myelosuppression. In addition, this agent is a potent immunosuppressant with inhibitory effects on CD4 and CD8 T cells. Patients are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including fungi, herpes, and Pneumocystis jiroveci.

\section*{Cladribine}

Cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine) is a purine nucleoside analog with high specificity for lymphoid cells. Inactive in its parent form, it is initially phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to the monophosphate form and eventually metabolized to the triphosphate form, which can then be incorporated into DNA. The triphosphate metabolite can also interfere with DNA synthesis and DNA repair by inhibiting DNA polymerase-a. and DNA-polymerase- $B$, respectively. Cladribine is indicated for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, and it also has activity in CLL and low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is normally administered as a single continuous 7-day infusion; under these conditions, it has a very manageable safety profile with the main toxicity consisting of transient myelosuppression. In addition, it has immunosuppressive effects, and a decrease in CD4 and CD8 T cells, lasting for over 1 year, is observed in patients.

\section*{PYRI MI DI NE ANTAGONI STS}

\section*{5-Fluorouracil}

5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a prodrug requiring activation via a complex series of biotransformation reactions to ribosyl and deoxyribosyl nucleotide metabolites. One of these metabolites, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'monophosphate (FdUMP), forms a covalently bound ternary complex with the enzyme thymidylate synthase and the reduced folate N 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, a reaction critical for the de novo synthesis of thymidylate. This results in inhibition of DNA synthesis through "thymineless death." 5-FU is converted to 5-fluorouridine-5'-triphosphate (FUTP), which is then incorporated into RNA, where it interferes with RNA processing and mRNA translation. In addition, 5-FU is converted to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine-5'-triphosphate (FdUTP), which can be incorporated into cellular DNA, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and function. Thus, the cytotoxicity of 5-FU is thought to be the result of the combined effects on both DNA- and RNAmediated events.
<smiles>O=c1cc[nH]c(=O)[nH]1</smiles>

Uracil
<smiles>O=c1[nH]cc(F)c(=O)[nH]1</smiles>

5-FU

5-FU is normally administered intravenously (Table 55-3) and has a half-life of 10-15 minutes. It is not administered by the oral route because its bioavailability is impaired by the high levels of the breakdown enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase present in the gut mucosa. Up to 80-85\% of an administered dose of 5-FU is catabolized by this enzyme.

5-FU is the most widely used agent in the treatment of colorectal cancer, both as adjuvant therapy and for advanced disease. In addition, it has activity against a wide variety of solid tumors, including cancers of the breast, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, liver, head and neck, and anus. Its major toxicities are listed in Table 55-3.

\section*{Capecitabine}

Capecitabine is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate prodrug with nearly $70-80 \%$ oral bioavailability. It undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver by the enzyme carboxylesterase to an intermediate, 5'-deoxy-5fluorocytidine. This, in turn, is converted to 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine by the enzyme cytidine deaminase. The 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine metabolite is then hydrolyzed by thymidine phosphorylase to 5-FU directly in the tumor. The expression of thymidine phosphorylase has been shown to be significantly higher in a broad range of solid tumors than in corresponding normal tissue. Peak plasma levels are achieved in about 1.5 hours, and peak 5-FU levels are reached at 2 hours after oral administration.

Capecitabine is used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer either as a single agent or in combination with the taxane docetaxel. It is also approved for use in the adjuvant therapy of stage III colon cancer as well as for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer as monotherapy. At this time, significant efforts are directed at combining this agent with other active cytotoxic agents, including irinotecan or oxaliplatin. The main toxicities of capecitabine include diarrhea and the hand-foot syndrome and are listed in Table 55-3. While myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting, and mucositis can also be observed with this agent, the incidence is significantly less than that seen with intravenous 5-FU.

\section*{Cytarabine}

Cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside, ara-C) is an S phase-specific antimetabolite that is converted by deoxycytidine kinase to the 5'-mononucleotide (ara-CMP). Ara-CMP is further metabolized to the triphosphate ara-CTP, which competitively inhibits DNA polymerase-and DNA polymerase- $B$, thereby resulting in blockade of DNA synthesis and DNA repair, respectively. Cytarabine is also incorporated into RNA and DNA. Incorporation into DNA leads to interference with chain elongation and defective ligation of fragments of newly synthesized DNA. The cellular retention time for ara-CTP appears to correlate with its lethality to malignant cells.

After intravenous administration (Table 55-3), the drug is cleared rapidly, with most of an administered dose being deaminated to an inactive form. The ratio of the anabolic enzyme deoxycytidine kinase to the inactivating catalyst cytidine deaminase is important in determining the eventual cytotoxicity of cytarabine.
<smiles>Nc1ccn(C2OC([O-])C(O)C2O)c(=O)n1</smiles>
<smiles>Nc1ccn(C2OC(O)C(O)C2O)c(=O)n1</smiles>

In view of cytarabine's $S$ phase specificity, the drug is highly schedule-dependent and must be given either by continuous infusion or every 8-12 hours for 5-7 days. Its activity is limited exclusively to hematologic malignancies, including acute myelogenous leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It has absolutely no activity in solid tumors. The main adverse effects are listed in Table 55-3.

\section*{Gemcitabine}

Gemcitabine is a deoxycytidine analog that is phosphorylated initially by the enzyme deoxycytidine kinase to the monophosphate form and then by other nucleoside kinases to di- and triphosphate nucleotide forms. The antitumor effect is considered to result from two different mechanisms: inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase by gemcitabine diphosphate, which reduces the level of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates required for DNA synthesis; and incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into DNA, leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis and function. Following incorporation of gemcitabine nucleotide, only one additional nucleotide can be added to the growing DNA strand, resulting in chain termination.
<smiles>Nc1ccn(C23CC(O)(F)C(CO)(O2)C(F)(F)C3O)c(=O)n1</smiles>

\section*{Gemcitabine}

Gemcitabine was initially approved for use in pancreatic cancer but is now widely used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Myelosuppression in the form of neutropenia is the principal dose-limiting toxicity.

\section*{Plant Alkaloids}

\section*{VI NBLASTI NE}

Vinblastine is an alkaloid derived from the periwinkle plant Vinca rosea. Its mechanism of action involves inhibition of tubulin polymerization, which disrupts assembly of microtubules, an important part of the cytoskeleton and the mitotic spindle. This inhibitory effect results in mitotic arrest in metaphase, bringing cell division to a halt, which then leads to cell death. Toxicity includes nausea and vomiting, bone marrow suppression, and alopecia. This agent is also a potent vesicant, and care must be taken in its administration. It has clinical activity in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, breast cancer, and germ cell cancer. See the section on Clinical Pharmacology, below, and Table 55-4.

Vinblastine

\section*{VI NCRI STI NE}

Vincristine is an alkaloid derivative of Vinca rosea and is closely related in structure to vinblastine. Its mechanism of action is considered to be identical to that of vinblastine in that it functions as a mitotic spindle poison leading to arrest of cells in the M phase of the cell cycle. Despite these similarities to vinblastine, vincristine has a strikingly different spectrum of clinical activity and toxicity.

Vincristine has been effectively combined with prednisone for remission induction in acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children. It is also active in various hematologic malignancies such as Hodgkin's and nonHodgkin's lymphomas, and multiple myeloma, and in several pediatric tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and Wilms' tumor. The main dose-limiting toxicity is neurotoxicity, usually expressed as a peripheral sensory neuropathy, although autonomic nervous system dysfunction-with orthostatic hypotension, sphincter problems, and paralytic ileus-cranial nerve palsies, ataxia, seizures, and coma have been observed. While myelosuppression can occur, it is generally milder and much less significant than with vinblastine. The other potential side effect that can develop is the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).

\section*{VI NORELBI NE}

Vinorelbine is a semisynthetic vinca alkaloid whose mechanism of action is identical to that of vinblastine and vincristine, ie, inhibition of mitosis of cells in the $M$ phase through inhibition of tubulin polymerization. This agent has activity in non-small cell lung cancer and in breast cancer. Myelosuppression with neutropenia is the dose-limiting toxicity, but nausea and vomiting, transient elevations in liver function tests, neurotoxicity, and SIADH are also reported.

\section*{EPI PODOPHYLLOTOXI NS}

Two compounds, VP-16 (etoposide) and a related drug, VM-26 (teniposide), are semisynthetic derivatives of podophyllotoxin, which is extracted from the mayapple root (Podophyllum peltatum). Both an intravenous and an oral formulation of etoposide are approved for clinical use in the USA.

Etoposide and teniposide are similar in chemical structure and in their effects-they block cell division in the late $\mathrm{S}-\mathrm{G}_{2}$ phase of the cell cycle. Their primary mode of action involves inhibition of topoisomerase II, which results in DNA damage through strand breakage induced by the formation of a ternary complex of drug, DNA, and enzyme. The drugs are water-insoluble and have to be formulated in a Cremophor vehicle for clinical use. These agents are administered via the intravenous route (Table 55-4) and are rapidly and widely distributed throughout the body except for the brain. Up to $90-95 \%$ of drug is protein-bound, mainly to albumin. Dose reduction is required in the setting of renal dysfunction. Etoposide has clinical activity in germ cell cancer, small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and gastric cancer and as high-dose therapy in the transplant setting for breast cancer and lymphomas. Teniposide use is limited mainly to acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

\section*{CAMPTOTHECI NS}

The camptothecins are natural products that are derived from the Camptotheca acuminata tree, and they inhibit the activity of topoisomerase I, the key enzyme responsible for cutting and religating single DNA strands. Inhibition of the enzyme results in DNA damage. Topotecan is indicated in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer as second-line therapy following initial treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved as second-line therapy of small cell lung cancer. The main route of elimination is renal excretion, and dosage must be adjusted in patients with renal impairment.

Irinotecan is a prodrug that is converted mainly in the liver by the carboxylesterase enzyme to the SN-38 metabolite, which is a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase I. In contrast to topotecan, irinotecan and SN-38 are mainly eliminated in bile and feces, and dose reduction is required in the setting of liver dysfunction. Irinotecan was originally approved as second-line monotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had failed fluorouracil-based therapy. It is also approved as first-line therapy when used in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin. Myelosuppression and diarrhea are the two most common adverse events. There are two forms of diarrhea: an early form that occurs within 24 hours after administration and is thought to be a cholinergic event effectively treated with atropine, and a late form that usually occurs 2-10 days after treatment. The late diarrhea can be severe, leading to significant electrolyte imbalance and dehydration in some cases.

\section*{TAXANES}

Paclitaxel is an alkaloid ester derived from the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia) and the European yew (Taxus baccata). The drug functions as a mitotic spindle poison through high-affinity binding to microtubules with
enhancement of tubulin polymerization. This promotion of microtubule assembly by paclitaxel occurs in the absence of microtubule-associated proteins and guanosine triphosphate and results in inhibition of mitosis and cell division.

Paclitaxel has significant activity in a broad range of solid tumors, including ovarian, advanced breast, nonsmall cell and small cell lung, head and neck, esophageal, prostate, and bladder cancers and AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. It is metabolized extensively by the liver P450 system, and nearly 80\% of the drug is excreted in feces via the hepatobiliary route. Therefore, dose reduction is required in the setting of liver dysfunction. The primary dose-limiting toxicities are listed in Table 55-4. Hypersensitivity reactions may be observed in up to $5 \%$ of patients, but the incidence can be reduced by premedication with dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, and an $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ blocker.

A novel albumin-bound paclitaxel formulation (Abraxane) has recently been approved for use in metastatic breast cancer. In contrast to paclitaxel, this formulation is not associated with hypersensitivity reactions, and premedication to prevent such reactions is not required. Moreover, this agent has significantly reduced myelosuppressive effects compared with paclitaxel, and the neurotoxicity that results appears to be more readily reversible than is typically observed with paclitaxel.

Docetaxel is a semisynthetic taxane derived from the European yew tree. Its mechanism of action, metabolism, and elimination are identical to those of paclitaxel. It is approved for use as second-line therapy in advanced breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, and it also has major activity in head and neck cancer, small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, advanced platinum-refractory ovarian cancer, and bladder cancer. Its major toxicities are listed in Table 55-4.

\section*{Antitumor Antibiotics}

Screening of microbial products has led to the discovery of a number of growth-inhibiting compounds that have proved to be clinically useful in cancer chemotherapy. Many of these antibiotics bind to DNA through intercalation between specific bases and block the synthesis of RNA, DNA, or both; cause DNA strand scission; and interfere with cell replication. All of the anticancer antibiotics now being used in clinical practice are products of various strains of the soil microbe Streptomyces. These include the anthracyclines, dactinomycin, bleomycin, and mitomycin.

\section*{ANTHRACYCLI NES}

The anthracycline antibiotics, isolated from Streptomyces peucetius var caesius, are among the most widely used cytotoxic anticancer drugs. The structures of two congeners, doxorubicin and daunorubicin, are shown below. Several other anthracycline analogs have entered clinical practice, including idarubicin, epirubicin, and mitoxantrone. Daunorubicin was the first agent in this class to be isolated, and it is still used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Doxorubicin has a broad spectrum of clinical activity against hematologic malignancies and a wide range of solid tumors. The anthracyclines exert their cytotoxic action through four major mechanisms. These are (1) inhibition of topoisomerase II; (2) high-affinity binding to DNA through intercalation, with consequent blockade of the synthesis of DNA and RNA, and DNA strand scission; (3) binding to cellular membranes to alter fluidity and ion transport; and (4) generation of semiquinone free radicals and oxygen free radicals through an iron-dependent, enzyme-mediated reductive process. This free radical mechanism has been established to be the cause of the cardiotoxicity associated with the anthracyclines.

In the clinical setting, anthracyclines are administered via the intravenous route (Table 55-4). The anthracyclines are metabolized extensively in the liver, with reduction and hydrolysis of the ring substituents. The hydroxylated metabolite is an active species, whereas the aglycone is inactive. Up to $50 \%$ of drug is eliminated in the feces via biliary excretion, and dose reduction is required in the setting of liver dysfunction. Although anthracyclines are usually administered on an every-3-week schedule, alternative schedules such as low-dose weekly or 72-96 hour continuous infusions have been shown to yield equivalent clinical efficacy with reduced overall toxicity.

Doxorubicin is one of the most important anticancer drugs, with major clinical activity in cancers of the breast, endometrium, ovary, testicle, thyroid, stomach, bladder, liver, and lung; in soft tissue sarcomas; and in several childhood cancers, including neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. It is also widely used in hematologic malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. It is generally used in combination with other anticancer agents (eg, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and 5-FU), and responses and remission duration tend to be improved with combination regimens as opposed to single-agent therapy. Daunorubicin has a far narrower spectrum of activity than doxorubicin. Daunorubicin has been mainly used for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, although there has been a shift in clinical practice toward using idarubicin, an analog of daunorubicin. Its efficacy in solid tumors appears to be limited.

Idarubicin is a semisynthetic anthracycline glycoside analog of daunorubicin, and it is approved for use in combination with cytarabine for induction therapy of acute myeloid leukemia. When combined with cytarabine, idarubicin appears to be more active than daunorubicin in producing complete remissions and in improving survival in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia.

Epirubicin is a doxorubicin analog whose mechanism of action is identical to that of all other anthracyclines. It was initially approved for use as a component of adjuvant therapy of early-stage, nodepositive breast cancer but is also used for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and gastric cancer.

The main dose-limiting toxicity of all anthracyclines is myelosuppression, with neutropenia more commonly observed than thrombocytopenia. In some cases, mucositis is dose-limiting. Two forms of cardiotoxicity are observed. The acute form occurs within the first 2-3 days and presents as arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities, other electrocardiographic changes, pericarditis, and myocarditis. This form is usually
transient and in most cases is asymptomatic. The chronic form results in a dose-dependent, dilated cardiomyopathy associated with heart failure. The chronic cardiac toxicity appears to result from increased production of free radicals within the myocardium. This effect is rarely seen at total doxorubicin dosages below $500-550 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$. Use of lower weekly doses or continuous infusions of doxorubicin appear to reduce the incidence of cardiac toxicity. In addition, treatment with the iron-chelating agent dexrazoxane (ICRF187) is currently approved to prevent or reduce anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in women with metastatic breast cancer who have received a total cumulative dose of doxorubicin of $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$. The anthracyclines can produce a "radiation recall reaction," with erythema and desquamation of the skin observed at sites of prior radiation therapy.

\section*{MITOXANTRONE}

Mitoxantrone (dihydroxyanthracenedione, DHAD) is an anthracene compound whose structure resembles the anthracycline ring. It binds to DNA to produce strand breakage and inhibits both DNA and RNA synthesis. It is currently used for treatment of advanced, hormone-refractory prostate cancer and lowgrade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is also indicated in breast cancer as well as in pediatric and adult acute myeloid leukemias. The plasma half-life of mitoxantrone in patients is approximately 75 hours, and it is predominantly excreted via the hepatobiliary route in feces. Myelosuppression with leukopenia is the doselimiting toxicity, and mild nausea and vomiting, mucositis, and alopecia also occur. Although the drug is thought to be less cardiotoxic than doxorubicin, both acute and chronic cardiac toxicity are reported. A blue discoloration of the fingernails, sclera, and urine can be observed up to 1-2 days after drug therapy.

\section*{DACTINOMYCI N}

Dactinomycin is an antitumor antibiotic isolated from a Streptomyces organism. It binds tightly to doublestranded DNA through intercalation between adjacent guanine-cytosine base pairs and inhibits all forms of DNA-dependent RNA synthesis, with ribosomal RNA formation being most sensitive to drug action.

Dactinomycin is mainly used to treat pediatric tumors such as Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Ewing's sarcoma, but it also has activity against germ cell tumors and gestational trophoblastic disease. As with the anthracyclines, dactinomycin can induce a radiation recall reaction. See Table 55-4 for other toxicities.

\section*{MITOMYCI N}

Mitomycin (mitomycin C) is an antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces caespitosus. It is an alkylating agent that undergoes metabolic activation through an enzyme-mediated reduction to generate an alkylating agent that cross-links DNA. Hypoxic tumor stem cells of solid tumors exist in an environment conducive to reductive reactions and are more sensitive to the cytotoxic actions of mitomycin than normal cells and oxygenated tumor cells. It is active in all phases of the cell cycle, and is the best available drug for use in combination with radiation therapy to attack hypoxic tumor cells. Its main clinical use is in the treatment of squamous cell cancer of the anus in combination with 5-FU and radiation therapy. In addition, it is used in combination chemotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and for breast, gastric, and pancreatic cancer. One special application of mitomycin has been in the intravesical treatment of superficial bladder cancer. Because virtually none of the agent is absorbed systemically, there is little to no systemic toxicity.

The common toxicities are outlined in Table 55-4. The hemolytic-uremic syndrome, manifested as
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure, as well as occasional instances of interstitial pneumonitis have been reported.

\section*{BLEOMYCIN}

Bleomycin is a small peptide that contains a DNA-binding region and an iron-binding domain at opposite ends of the molecule. It acts by binding to DNA, which results in single-strand and double-strand breaks following free radical formation, and inhibition of DNA biosynthesis. The fragmentation of DNA is due to oxidation of a DNA-bleomycin-Fe(II) complex and leads to chromosomal aberrations. Bleomycin is a cell cycle-specific drug that causes accumulation of cells in the $\mathrm{G}_{2}$ phase of the cell cycle.

Bleomycin is indicated for the treatment of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, germ cell tumor, head and neck cancer, and squamous cell cancer of the skin, cervix, and vulva. In addition, it can be used as a sclerosing agent for malignant pleural effusions and ascites. One advantage of this agent is that it can be given subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously (Table 55-4). Peak blood levels of bleomycin after intramuscular injection appear within 30-60 minutes. Intravenous injection of similar dosages yields higher peak concentrations and a terminal half-life of about 2.5 hours. Elimination of bleomycin is mainly via renal excretion; dose modification is recommended in the setting of renal dysfunction.

Pulmonary toxicity is dose-limiting for bleomycin and usually presents as pneumonitis with cough, dyspnea, dry inspiratory crackles on physical examination, and infiltrates on chest x-ray. The incidence of pulmonary toxicity is increased in patients older than 70 years of age, in those who receive cumulative doses greater than 400 units, in those with underlying pulmonary disease, and in those who have received prior mediastinal or chest irradiation. In rare cases, pulmonary toxicity can be fatal. Other toxicities are listed in Table 55-4.

\section*{Hormonal Agents}

\section*{ESTROGEN \& ANDROGEN INHI BITORS}

The antiestrogen tamoxifen has proved to be extremely useful for the treatment of both early-stage and metastatic breast cancer. It is also approved as a chemopreventive agent in women at high risk for breast cancer. In addition, this hormonal agent has activity in endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen functions as a competitive partial agonist-inhibitor of estrogen and binds to the estrogen receptors of estrogen-sensitive tumors. However, tamoxifen has a tenfold lower affinity for the estrogen receptor (ER) than does estradiol, indicating the importance of ablation of endogenous estrogen for optimal antiestrogen effect. In addition to its direct antiestrogen effects on tumor cells, tamoxifen also suppresses serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 and up-regulates local production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B).
Tamoxifen

Tamoxifen is given orally and is rapidly and completely absorbed. High plasma levels of tamoxifen are
obtained within 4-6 hours after oral administration, and the agent has a much longer biologic half-life than estradiol-on the order of 7-14 days. It is extensively metabolized by the liver P450 system, and the main metabolites also possess antitumor activity similar to that of the parent drug. Tamoxifen is well tolerated, and its side effects are generally quite mild (Table 55-5).

Flutamide and bicalutamide are nonsteroidal antiandrogen agents that bind to the androgen receptor and inhibit androgen effects. They are administered orally and are rapidly and completely absorbed. At present they are used in combination with radiation therapy for the treatment of early-stage prostate cancer and in the setting of metastatic prostate cancer. Toxicities are listed in Table 55-5.

\section*{GONADOTROPI N-RELEASI NG HORMONE AGONI STS}

Leuprolide and goserelin are synthetic peptide analogs of naturally occurring gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH, LHRH). They are described in further detail in Chapters 37 and 40. When given as depot preparations, these agents lead to a transient release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) followed by marked inhibition of the release of these gonadotropins. In men, this results in castration levels of testosterone after 2-4 weeks of therapy.

Leuprolide and goserelin are indicated in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and more recently, these agents have been incorporated as part of neoadjuvant therapy of early-stage prostate cancer. Leuprolide and goserelin are now formulated in long-acting depot forms, which allows for administration at monthly or longer intervals. The main adverse effects include hot flushes, impotence, and gynecomastia. Other toxicities are given in Table 55-5.

\section*{AROMATASE INHIBITORS}

Aminoglutethimide is a nonsteroidal inhibitor of corticosteroid synthesis at the first step involving the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone (see Chapter 39). Aminoglutethimide also inhibits the extraadrenal synthesis of estrone and estradiol. Aside from its direct effects on adrenal steroidogenesis, aminoglutethimide is an inhibitor of an aromatase enzyme that converts the adrenal androgen androstenedione to estrone (see Figure 40-2). This aromatization of an androgenic precursor into an estrogen occurs in body fat. Since estrogens promote the growth of breast cancer, estrogen synthesis in adipose tissue can be important in breast cancer growth in postmenopausal women.

Aminoglutethimide is primarily used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in women whose tumors express significant levels of estrogen or progesterone receptors. It also has activity in hormone-dependent, advanced prostate cancer. Aminoglutethimide is normally administered with hydrocortisone to prevent symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. Hydrocortisone is preferable to dexamethasone because the latter agent accelerates the rate of catabolism of aminoglutethimide. Adverse effects of aminoglutethimide are listed in

Table 55-5.
Anastrozole is a selective nonsteroidal inhibitor of aromatase that has no inhibitory effect on adrenal glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid synthesis. It is presently approved for first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer that is ER-positive, for treatment of postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer that is ER-positive and has progressed while on tamoxifen therapy, and as adjuvant therapy of postmenopausal women with hormone-positive, early-stage breast cancer.
Letrozole is a nonsteroidal competitive inhibitor of aromatase that is significantly more potent than aminoglutethimide and acts in the same way as anastrozole. It is also indicated for first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer and for second-line treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer after progression on tamoxifen therapy. Exemestane is a steroid hormonal suicide inhibitor that binds to and irreversibly inactivates aromatase. There appears to be a lack of cross-resistance between exemestane and nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors. This agent is indicated for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed on tamoxifen therapy. Each of these aromatase inhibitors exhibits a similar side effect profile (Table 55-5, see also Chapter 40).

\section*{I MATI NI B}

Imatinib (STI571; Gleevec) is an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase domain of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein and prevents the phosphorylation of the kinase substrate by ATP. It is indicated for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by the $t(9: 22)$ Philadelphia chromosomal translocation. This translocation results in the Bcr-Abl fusion protein, the causative agent in CML, and is present in up to $95 \%$ of patients with this disease. This agent inhibits other activated receptor tyrosine kinases for platelet-derived growth factor receptor, stem cell factor, and c-kit.

Imatinib is well absorbed orally; it is highly protein-bound in plasma. The drug is metabolized in the liver, and elimination of metabolites occurs mainly in feces via biliary excretion. This agent is approved for use as first-line therapy in chronic phase CML, in blast crisis, and as second-line therapy for chronic phase CML that has progressed on prior interferon-a. therapy. I matinib is effective also for treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors expressing the c-kit tyrosine kinase. Dosage and toxicities are listed in Table 55-6.

Dasatinib (Sprycel) is an oral inhibitor of several kinases and is approved for use in CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

\section*{GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR INHIBITORS}

\section*{Cetuximab}

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the erb-B family of growth factor receptors, and it is overexpressed in a number of solid tumors. Activation of the EGFR signaling pathway results in downstream activation of several key cellular events involved in cellular growth and proliferation, invasion and metastasis, and angiogenesis. In addition, this pathway inhibits the cytotoxic activity of various anticancer agents and radiation therapy, presumably through suppression of key apoptotic mechanisms, thereby leading to the development of cellular drug resistance.

Cetuximab (IMC-225; Erbitux) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the EGFR, and it is presently approved for use in combination with irinotecan in the refractory setting or as monotherapy in patients who are deemed to be irinotecan-refractory. There is growing evidence that cetuximab can be effectively and safely combined with irinotecan- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in the first-line therapy of metastatic colorectal cancer as well. This agent is also approved for use in combination with radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer. This agent is well tolerated, with the main adverse effects being an acneiform skin rash and a hypersensitivity infusion reaction. Dosage and toxicities are listed in Table 55-6.

\section*{Gefitinib \& Erlotinib}

Gefitinib (ZD1694; Iressa) and erlotinib (OSI-774; Tarceva) are small molecule inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase domain associated with the EGFR, and both are approved for use in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer that is refractory to at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. Dosage and toxicities of both of these agents are listed in Table 55-6. Patients who are nonsmokers and who have a bronchoalveolar histologic subtype appear to be more responsive to these agents. In addition, erlotinib has been approved for use in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. With respect to toxicity, an acneiform skin rash and diarrhea are the most common adverse effects observed with these small molecules.

\section*{Bevacizumab}

The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most critical angiogenic growth factors. The growth of both primary and metastatic tumors requires an intact vasculature; VEGF and the VEGF-signaling pathway therefore represent an attractive target for chemotherapy. Several approaches have been taken to inhibit VEGF signaling; they include inhibition of VEGF interactions with its receptor by targeting either the VEGF ligand with antibodies or soluble chimeric receptors, or by direct inhibition of the VEGF receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity by small molecule inhibitors.

Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that targets all forms of VEGF-A. This antibody binds to and prevents VEGF-A from interacting with the target VEGF receptors. Bevacizumab can be safely and effectively combined with 5-FU-, irinotecan-, and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Bevacizumab is FDA approved as a first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with any intravenous fluoropyrimidine-containing regimen. The main adverse effects observed with this agent include hypertension, an increased incidence of arterial thromboembolic events (transient ischemic attack, stroke, angina, and myocardial infarction), wound healing complications and gastrointestinal perforations, and proteinuria. Dosage is given in Table 55-6.

\section*{ASPARAGI NASE}

Asparaginase ( L-asparagine amidohydrolase) is an enzyme used to treat childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia. The drug is isolated and purified from bacterial culture for clinical use. It hydrolyzes circulating Lasparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia. Because tumor cells lack asparagine synthetase, they require an exogenous source of $L$-asparagine. Thus, depletion of $L$-asparagine results in effective inhibition of protein synthesis. In contrast, normal cells can synthesize L-asparagine and thus are less susceptible to the cytotoxic action of asparaginase. The main adverse effect of this agent is a hypersensitivity reaction manifested by fever, chills, nausea and vomiting, skin rash, and urticaria. Severe cases can present with bronchospasm, respiratory failure, and hypotension. Other toxicities include an increased risk of both clotting and bleeding as a result of alterations in various clotting factors, pancreatitis, and neurologic toxicity with lethargy, confusion, hallucinations, and coma.

\section*{HYDROXYUREA}

Hydroxyurea is an analog of urea whose mechanism of action involves the inhibition of DNA synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase, resulting in depletion of deoxynucleoside triphosphate pools. This agent exerts its effects in the $S$ phase of the cell cycle. The drug is administered orally and has nearly $100 \%$ oral bioavailability. It is mainly used in chronic myelogenous leukemia and treatment of the blast crisis of acute myeloid leukemia. However, it is also effective as an adjunct with radiation therapy for head and neck cancer and in treating essential thrombocytosis and polycythemia vera. Myelosuppression is the dose-limiting toxicity, but nausea and vomiting, mucositis and diarrhea, headache and increased lethargy, and a maculopapular skin rash with pruritus are also observed.

\section*{RETI NOI C ACI D DERI VATI VES}

All-trans- retinoic acid (tretinoin) produces remissions in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) through the induction of terminal differentiation, in which the leukemic promyelocytes lose their ability to proliferate. APL is associated with a $\mathrm{t}(15: 17)$ chromosomal translocation, which disrupts the gene for the nuclear receptor-ar for retinoic acid and fuses it to a gene called PML. This chimeric gene, which
expresses aberrant forms of the retinoic acid receptor-a, is present in virtually all patients with promyelocytic leukemia and appears to be responsible for sensitivity to all-trans- retinoic acid. This agent is approved for use in APL following progression or relapse with anthracycline-based chemotherapy and for patients in whom anthracycline-based chemotherapy is contraindicated. However, a number of serious adverse events have been observed. They include vitamin A toxicity manifesting as headache, fever, dry skin and mucous membranes, skin rash, pruritus, and conjunctivitis; retinoic acid syndrome with fever, leukocytosis, dyspnea, weight gain, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, and pleural or pericardial effusions; increased serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels; central nervous system toxicity in the form of dizziness, anxiety, depression, confusion, and agitation; abdominal pain and diarrhea; and transient elevations in liver function tests. This retinoid has also been shown to be teratogenic.

\section*{ARSENI C TRI OXI DE}

Arsenic trioxide $\left(\mathrm{AS}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ is used for induction of remission in patients with APL with the $\mathrm{t}(15: 17)$ chromosomal translocation refractory to or relapsed following first-line therapy with all-trans- retinoic acidand anthracycline-based chemotherapy. It functions by inducing differentiation through degradation of the chimeric PML/RAR-1. protein. In addition, it induces apoptosis through a mitochondrion-dependent process, resulting in subsequent release of cytochrome C with caspase activation. This drug is administered via the intravenous route, and it is widely distributed in the body. The main toxicities are fatigue, electrocardiographic changes with QT prolongation, arrhythmias, and a syndrome characterized by fever, dyspnea, skin rash, fluid retention, and weight gain.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF CANCER CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS}

A thorough knowledge of the kinetics of tumor cell proliferation along with an understanding of the pharmacology and mechanism of action of cancer chemotherapeutic agents is important in designing optimal regimens for patients with cancer (Table 55-7). The strategy for developing drug regimens requires a knowledge of the particular characteristics of specific tumors. For example, is there a high growth fraction? Is there a high spontaneous cell death rate? Are most of the cells in $\mathrm{G}_{0}$ ? Is a significant fraction of the tumor composed of hypoxic stem cells? Are their normal counterparts under hormonal control? Similarly, knowledge of the pharmacology of specific drugs is important. Are the tumor cells sensitive to the drug? Is the drug cell cycle-specific? Does the drug require activation in certain normal tissue such as the liver (cyclophosphamide), or is it activated in the tumor tissue itself (capecitabine)? Similarly, for some tumor types, knowledge of receptor expression is important. For example, in patients with breast cancer, analysis of the tumor for expression of estrogen or progesterone receptors-or overexpression of HER-2 receptors-is important in guiding therapy. Knowledge of specific pathway abnormalities (eg, EGFR pathway) for intracellular signaling may prove important for the next generation of anticancer drugs.

Drugs that affect cycling cells can often be used most effectively after treatment with a cell cyclenonspecific agent (eg, alkylating agents); this principle has been tested in a few human tumors with increasing success. Similarly, recognition of true drug synergism (tumor cell kill by the drug combination greater than the additive effects of the individual drugs) or antagonism is important in the design of combination chemotherapeutic programs. The combination of cytarabine with an anthracycline in acute myelogenous leukemia and the use of vinblastine or etoposide along with cisplatin and bleomycin in testicular tumors are good examples of true drug synergism against cancer cells but not against normal tissues.

In general, it is preferable to use cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents in intensive pulse courses every 3-4 weeks rather than to use continuous daily dosage schedules. This schedule allows for maximum effects against neoplastic cell populations with complete hematologic and immunologic recovery between courses rather than leaving the patient continuously suppressed with cytotoxic therapy. This approach reduces adverse effects but does not reduce therapeutic efficacy.

The application of these principles is well illustrated in the current approach to the treatment of acute leukemias, lymphomas, Wilms' tumor, and germ cell testicular cancer.

\section*{THE LEUKEMI AS}

\section*{Acute Leukemia}

\section*{Childhood Leukemia}

ALL is the predominant form of leukemia in childhood, and it is the most common form of cancer in children. Children with this disease have a relatively good prognosis. A subset of patients with neoplastic lymphocytes expressing surface antigenic features of T lymphocytes has a poor prognosis (see Chapter 56). A cytoplasmic enzyme expressed by normal thymocytes, terminal deoxycytidyl transferase (terminal transferase), is also expressed in many cases of ALL. T cell ALL also expresses high levels of the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA). This led to interest in the use of the ADA inhibitor pentostatin (deoxycoformycin) for treatment of such T cell cases. Until 1948, the median length of survival in ALL was 3 months. With the advent of the folic acid antagonists, the length of survival was greatly increased. Subsequently, corticosteroids, 6-MP, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, daunorubicin, and asparaginase have all been found to be active against this disease. A combination of vincristine and prednisone plus other
agents is currently used to induce remission. Over $90 \%$ of children enter complete remission with this therapy with only minimal toxicity. However, circulating leukemic cells often migrate to sanctuary sites located in the brain and testes. The value of prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate therapy for prevention of central nervous system leukemia (a major mechanism of relapse) has been clearly demonstrated. Intrathecal therapy with methotrexate should therefore be considered as a standard component of the induction regimen for children with ALL.

\section*{Adult Leukemia}

Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is the most common leukemia seen in adults. The single most active agent for AML is cytarabine; however, it is best used in combination with an anthracycline, in which case complete remissions occur in about 70\% of patients. Idarubicin has now replaced daunorubicin as the preferred anthracycline.

Patients often require intensive supportive care during the period of induction chemotherapy. Such care includes platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding, filgrastim to shorten periods of neutropenia, and antibiotics to combat infections. Younger patients (eg, < age 55) who are in complete remission and have an HLA-matched donor are candidates for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The transplant procedure is preceded by high-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation followed by immunosuppression. This approach may cure up to 35-40\% of eligible patients. Patients over age 60 respond less well to chemotherapy, primarily because their tolerance for aggressive therapy and their resistance to infection is lower.

Once remission of AML is achieved, consolidation chemotherapy is required to maintain a durable remission and to induce cure.

\section*{Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia}

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) arises from a chromosomally abnormal hematopoietic stem cell in which a balanced translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, $\mathrm{t}(9: 22)$, is observed in 90-95\% of cases. This translocation results in constitutive expression of the Bcr-Abl fusion oncoprotein with a molecular weight of 210 kDa . The clinical symptoms and course are related to the white blood cell count and its rate of increase. Most patients with white cell counts over $50,000 / \mu \mathrm{L}$ should be treated. The goals of treatment are to reduce the granulocytes to normal levels, to raise the hemoglobin concentration to normal, and to relieve disease-related symptoms. There has been a significant change in the management of this disease. Recently, the signal transduction inhibitor imatinib was approved for use as first-line therapy in previously untreated patients with chronic phase CML. Imatinib is also recommended in patients with chronic phase disease who have failed prior interferon-c. therapy. Nearly all patients treated with imatinib exhibit a complete hematologic response, and up to 40-50\% of patients will show a complete cytogenetic response. The usual dose for chronic phase disease is $400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, and an advantage of this drug is that it is given orally. As described previously, this drug is extremely well tolerated and is associated with relatively minor side effects. Other treatment options include interferon-a, busulfan, other oral alkylating agents, and hydroxyurea.

\section*{Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia}

Patients with early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have a relatively good prognosis, and therapy has not changed the course of the disease. However, in the setting of high-risk disease or in the presence
of disease-related symptoms, treatment is indicated.
Chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide are the two most widely used alkylating agents for this disease. Chlorambucil is usually administered at a dose of $0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$, with close monitoring of blood counts at weekly intervals. It is frequently combined with prednisone, although there is no clear evidence that the combination yields better response rates or survival compared with chlorambucil alone. Cyclophosphamide is usually given in dosages of $1-2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ every $3-4$ weeks. In most cases, cyclophosphamide is combined with vincristine and prednisone (COP), or it can also be given with these same drugs along with doxorubicin (CHOP). The purine nucleoside analog fludarabine is also effective in treating CLL. This agent can be given alone, in combination with cyclophosphamide and with mitoxantrone and dexamethasone, or combined with the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab.

Monoclonal antibody-targeted therapies are being more widely used in CLL, especially in relapsed or refractory disease. Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the CD52 antigen and is approved for use in CLL that is refractory to alkylating agent or fludarabine therapy. Response rates up to $30-35 \%$ are observed, with disease stabilization in another $30 \%$ of patients. Rituximab is an antiCD20 antibody that also has documented clinical activity in this setting. This chimeric antibody appears to enhance the antitumor effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy, and is also effective in settings in which resistance to chemotherapy has developed.

\section*{THE LYMPHOMAS}

\section*{Hodgkin's Disease}

The treatment of Hodgkin's disease has undergone dramatic evolution over the last 30 years. Hodgkin's disease is now recognized as a B cell neoplasm in which the malignant Reed-Sternberg cells have rearranged VH genes. In addition, the Epstein-Barr virus genome has been identified in up to 80\% of tumor specimens.

Complete staging evaluation is required before a definitive treatment plan can be made. For patients with stage I and stage IIA disease, there has been a significant change in the treatment approach. Initially, these patients were treated with extended-field radiation therapy. However, given the late effects of radiation therapy, which include hypothyroidism and an increased risk of secondary cancers and coronary artery disease, combined-modality therapy with a brief course of combination chemotherapy and involved field radiation therapy is now the recommended approach. The main advance for patients with advanced stage III and IV Hodgkin's disease came with the development of MOPP (mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone) chemotherapy in the 1960s. This regimen resulted initially in high complete response rates-on the order of $80-90 \%$, with cures in up to $60 \%$ of patients. More recently, the anthracycline-containing regimen ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) has been shown to be more effective and less toxic than MOPP, especially with regard to the incidence of sterility and secondary malignancies. This regimen uses four cycles of ABVD. An alternative regimen, termed Stanford V, utilizes a 12-week course of combination chemotherapy (doxorubicin, vinblastine, mechlorethamine, vincristine, bleomycin, etoposide, and prednisone), followed by involved radiation therapy.

With all these regimens, over 80\% of previously untreated patients with advanced Hodgkin's disease (stages III and IV) are expected to go into complete remission, with disappearance of all disease-related symptoms and objective evidence of disease. Approximately $50-60 \%$ of all patients with Hodgkin's disease are cured of their disease.

\section*{Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas}

Over the past 25 years, there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This is a heterogeneous disease, and the clinical characteristics of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma subsets are related to the underlying histopathologic features and the extent of disease involvement. In general, the nodular (or follicular) lymphomas have a far better prognosis, with a median survival up to 7 years, compared with the diffuse lymphomas, which have a median survival of about 1-2 years.

Combination chemotherapy is the treatment standard for patients with diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The anthracycline-containing regimen CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) has been considered the best treatment in terms of initial therapy. Randomized phase III clinical studies have now shown that the combination of CHOP with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab results in improved response rates, disease-free survival, and overall survival compared with CHOP chemotherapy alone.

The nodular follicular lymphomas are low-grade, indolent tumors that tend to present in an advanced stage and are usually confined to lymph nodes, bone marrow, and spleen. This form of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, when presenting at an advanced stage, is considered incurable, and treatment is generally palliative. To date, there is no evidence that immediate treatment with combination chemotherapy offers clinical benefit over close observation and "watchful waiting" with initiation of chemotherapy at the time of disease symptoms.

\section*{MULTI PLE MYELOMA}

This plasma cell malignancy is one of the models of neoplastic disease in humans as it arises from a single tumor stem cell. Moreover, the tumor cells produce a marker protein (myeloma immunoglobulin) that allows the total body burden of tumor cells to be quantified. Multiple myeloma principally involves the bone marrow and bone, causing bone pain, lytic lesions, bone fractures, and anemia as well as an increased susceptibility to infection.

Most patients with multiple myeloma are symptomatic at the time of initial diagnosis and require treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Treatment with the combination of the alkylating agent melphalan and prednisone (MP protocol) remains a standard regimen. About $40 \%$ of patients respond to the MP combination, and the median remission is on the order of $2-2.5$ years. While a host of studies have investigated the efficacy of combinations of multiple alkylating agents, none of these regimens have as yet been shown to be superior to MP.

Melphalan and other alkylating agents should be avoided in patients who are thought to be candidates for high-dose therapy with stem cell transplantation, as prior therapy will affect the success of stem cell harvesting. In this setting, the nonalkylator combination of vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (VAD) has been used.

Thalidomide is now a well-established agent for treating refractory or relapsed disease, and about 30\% of patients will achieve a response to this therapy. More recently, thalidomide has been used in combination with dexamethasone, and response rates on the order of $65 \%$ have been observed. Studies are now under way to directly compare VAD with the combination of thalidomide and dexamethasone. In some patients, especially those with poor performance status, single-agent pulse dexamethasone administered on a weekly basis can be effective in palliating symptoms. The proteosome inhibitor bortezomib has been
recently approved for use in relapsing or refractory multiple myeloma. This agent is thought to exert its main cytotoxic effects through inhibition of the NF-kB signaling pathway, and further efforts are focused on developing this agent in combination regimens.

\section*{BREAST CANCER}

\section*{Stage I \& Stage II Disease}

The management of primary breast cancer has undergone a remarkable evolution as a result of major efforts at early diagnosis (through encouragement of self-examination as well as through the use of cancer detection centers) and the implementation of combined modality approaches incorporating systemic chemotherapy as an adjuvant to surgery and radiation therapy. Women with stage I disease (small primaries and negative axillary lymph node dissections) are currently treated with surgery alone, and they have an $80 \%$ chance of cure.

Women with node-positive disease have a high risk of both local and systemic recurrence. Thus, lymph node status directly indicates the risk of occult distant micrometastasis. In this situation, postoperative use of systemic adjuvant chemotherapy with six cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF protocol) or of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) has been shown to significantly reduce the relapse rate and prolong survival. Alternative regimens with equivalent clinical benefit include four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide and six cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC). Each of these chemotherapy regimens has benefited women with stage II breast cancer with one to three involved lymph nodes. Women with four or more involved nodes have had limited benefit thus far from adjuvant chemotherapy. Long-term analysis has clearly shown improved survival rates in node-positive premenopausal women who have been treated aggressively with multiagent combination chemotherapy. Preliminary results from three randomized clinical trials suggest that the addition of trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the HER-2/neu receptor, to anthracycline- and taxane-containing adjuvant chemotherapy benefits women with HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer with respect to disease-free and overall survival.

Breast cancer was the first neoplasm shown to be responsive to hormonal manipulation. Tamoxifen is beneficial in postmenopausal women when used alone or when combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy. The present recommendation is to administer tamoxifen for 5 years of continuous therapy after surgical resection. Longer durations of tamoxifen therapy do not appear to add additional clinical benefit. Postmenopausal women who complete 5 years of tamoxifen therapy should be placed on an aromatase inhibitor for at least 2.5 years, although the optimal duration is unknown. In women who have completed 2-3 years of tamoxifen therapy, treatment with an aromatase inhibitor for a total of 5 years of hormonal therapy is now recommended.

Results from several randomized trials for breast cancer have established that adjuvant chemotherapy for premenopausal women and adjuvant tamoxifen for postmenopausal women are of benefit to women with stage I (node-negative) breast cancer. While this group of patients has the lowest overall risk of recurrence after surgery alone (about 35-50\% over 15 years), this risk can be further reduced with adjuvant therapy.

\section*{Stage III \& Stage IV Disease}

The approach to women with advanced breast cancer remains a major problem, as current treatment options are only palliative. Combination chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or a combination of both results
in overall response rates of 40-50\%, with only a 10-20\% complete response rate. Breast cancers expressing estrogen receptors (ER) or progesterone receptors (PR), retain the intrinsic hormonal sensitivities of the normal breast-including the growth-stimulatory response to ovarian, adrenal, and pituitary hormones. Patients who show improvement with hormonal ablative procedures also respond to the addition of tamoxifen. The aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole are now approved as first-line therapy in women with advanced breast cancer whose tumors are hormone-receptor positive. In addition, these agents and exemestane are approved as second-line therapy following treatment with tamoxifen.

Patients with significant visceral involvement of the lung, liver, or brain and those with rapidly progressive disease rarely benefit from hormonal maneuvers, and initial systemic chemotherapy is indicated in such cases. For the 25-30\% of breast cancer patients whose tumors express the HER-2/neu cell surface receptor, the humanized monoclonal anti-HER-2/neu antibody, trastuzumab, is available for therapeutic use alone or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy.

\section*{Systemic Chemotherapy}

About $50-60 \%$ of patients with metastatic disease respond to initial chemotherapy. A broad range of anticancer agents have activity in this disease, including the anthracyclines (doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, and epirubicin), the taxanes (docetaxel, paclitaxel, and albumin-bound paclitaxel), navelbine, capecitabine, gemcitabine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and cisplatin. Doxorubicin and the taxanes are the most active cytotoxic drugs. Combination chemotherapy has been found to induce higher and more durable remissions in up to 50-80\% of patients, and anthracycline-containing regimens are now considered the standard of care in first-line therapy. With most combination regimens, partial remissions have a median duration of about 10 months and complete remissions have a duration of about 15 months. Unfortunately, only $10-20 \%$ of patients achieve complete remissions with any of these regimens, and as noted, complete remissions are usually not long-lasting. The addition of tamoxifen to combination chemotherapy yields only modest additional improvement.

\section*{PROSTATE CANCER}

Prostate cancer was the second type of cancer shown to be responsive to hormonal manipulation. The treatment of choice for patients with advanced prostate cancer is elimination of testosterone production by the testes either through surgical or chemical castration. Bilateral orchiectomy or estrogen therapy in the form of diethylstilbestrol was previously used as first-line therapy. However, at present, the use of LHRH agonists-including leuprolide and goserelin agonists, alone or in combination with an antiandrogen (eg, flutamide, bicalutamide, or nilutamide)—has become the preferred approach. There appears to be no survival advantage of total androgen blockade using a combination of LHRH agonist and antiandrogen agent compared with single-agent therapy. Hormonal treatment reduces symptoms-especially bone pain-in $70-80 \%$ of patients and may cause a significant reduction in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, which is now widely accepted as a surrogate marker for response to treatment in prostate cancer. Although initial hormonal manipulation is able to control symptoms for up to 2 years, patients usually present with progressive disease. Second-line hormonal therapies include aminoglutethimide plus hydrocortisone, the antifungal agent ketoconazole plus hydrocortisone, or hydrocortisone alone.

Unfortunately, nearly all patients with advanced prostate cancer eventually become refractory to hormone therapy. A regimen of mitoxantrone and prednisone is approved in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer since it provides effective palliation in those who experience significant bone pain.

Estramustine is an antimicrotubule agent that produces an almost $20 \%$ response rate as a single agent. However, when used in combination with either etoposide or a taxane such as docetaxel or paclitaxel, response rates are more than doubled to 40-50\%. The combination of docetaxel and prednisone was recently shown to confer survival advantage when compared with the mitoxantrone-prednisone regimen, and this combination has now become the standard of care for hormone-refractory prostate cancer.

\section*{GASTROI NTESTI NAL CANCERS}

Colorectal cancer is the most common type of gastrointestinal malignancy. Approximately 145,000 new cases are diagnosed each year in the USA; worldwide, there are nearly one million cases diagnosed each year. At the time of initial presentation, only about $40-45 \%$ of cases are potentially curable with surgery. Patients presenting with high-risk stage II disease and stage III disease are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy with an oxaliplatin-based regimen in combination with 5-FU plus leucovorin, or with oral capecitabine and are generally treated for up to 6-8 months following surgical resection. Treatment with this combination regimen reduces the recurrence rate after surgery by $35 \%$ in these patients and clearly improves overall patient survival compared with surgery alone. For patients with rectal carcinoma, surgical adjuvant therapy with protracted intravenous infusion of 5-FU along with pelvic irradiation provides a modest albeit significant improvement in both relapse-free and overall survival.

As a single agent, the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan was initially approved as second-line therapy in patients who were no longer responding to 5-FU-based chemotherapy. The combination of irinotecan, 5-FU, and leucovorin (IFL protocol) when given either in a weekly bolus fashion or via a biweekly infusion schedule has now been shown to provide significant clinical benefit in terms of overall response rates, time to disease progression, and survival when compared with treatment with the combination of 5-FU and leucovorin alone. This regimen is now approved for use in the first-line setting. Oxaliplatin in combination with a biweekly infusion schedule of 5-FU and leucovorin (FOLFOX regimen) is also approved for use in the first-line setting. Recent clinical studies have shown that FOLFOX in combination with the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab or with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab results in significantly improved response rates with no worsening of the toxicities normally observed with chemotherapy.

The incidence of gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, and pancreatic cancer is much lower than for colorectal cancer, but these malignancies are more aggressive. In most cases, they cannot be completely resected surgically, as most patients present with either locally advanced or metastatic disease at the time of their initial diagnosis. 5-FU-based chemotherapy has been the usual approach for gastroesophageal cancers. Recently, there has been a shift toward incorporating cisplatin-based regimens in combination with either irinotecan or with one of the taxanes, paclitaxel or docetaxel. Response rates of 40-50\% are now being reported. In addition, neoadjuvant approaches with combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy prior to surgery appear to have some promise in selected patients. Although gemcitabine is approved for use as a single-agent in metastatic pancreatic cancer, the overall response rate is less than $10 \%$, with no complete responses. Intense efforts are now being placed on incorporating gemcitabine into various combination regimens and on identifying novel agents that target signal transduction pathways thought to be critical for the growth of pancreatic cancer. One such agent is the small molecule inhibitor erlotinib, which targets the EGFR-associated tyrosine kinase. This agent was recently approved for use in combination with gemcitabine in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

\section*{LUNG CANCER}

Lung cancer can be divided into two main histopathologic subtypes, non-small cell and small cell. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) makes up about $75-80 \%$ of all cases of lung cancer, and this group includes adenocarcinoma, squamous cell cancer, and large cell cancer, while small cell lung cancer (SCLC) makes up the remaining 20-25\%. When NSCLC is diagnosed in an advanced stage with metastatic disease, the prognosis is extremely poor, with a median survival of about 8 months. It is clear that prevention (primarily through avoidance of cigarette smoking) and early detection remain the most important means of control. When diagnosed at an early stage, surgical resection can result in patient cure. Moreover, recent studies have shown that adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy provides a survival benefit in patients with pathologic stage IB, II, and IIIA disease. However, in most cases, distant metastases have occurred at the time of diagnosis. In certain instances, radiation therapy can be offered for palliation of pain, airway obstruction, or bleeding and to treat patients whose performance status would not allow for more aggressive treatments.

In patients with advanced disease, palliative systemic chemotherapy is generally recommended. At this time, for patients with good performance status and those with nonsquamous histology, the combination of the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab with carboplatin and paclitaxel has become the treatment of choice. In patients who are deemed not to be candidates for bevacizumab therapy, a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen is preferred, although non-platinum regimens may be used as alternatives.

Small cell lung cancer is the most aggressive form of lung cancer, and it is extremely sensitive to platinumbased combination regimens, including cisplatin and etoposide or cisplatin and irinotecan. The topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan is used as second-line monotherapy in patients who have failed a platinum-based regimen. When diagnosed as limited stage, this disease is potentially curable with a combined modality approach using chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

\section*{OVARI AN CANCER}

In the majority of patients, this cancer remains occult and becomes symptomatic only after it has already metastasized to the peritoneal cavity. At this stage, it usually presents with malignant ascites. It is important to accurately stage this cancer with laparoscopy, ultrasound, and CT scanning. Patients with stage I disease appear to benefit from whole-abdomen radiotherapy and may receive additional benefit from combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and cyclophosphamide.

Combination chemotherapy is the standard approach to stage III and stage IV disease. Randomized clinical studies have shown that the combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin provides survival benefit compared with the previous standard combination of cisplatin plus cyclophosphamide. More recently, carboplatin plus paclitaxel has become the treatment of choice. In patients who present with recurrent disease, the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan, the alkylating agent altretamine, and liposomal doxorubicin are used as single agent monotherapy.

\section*{TESTI CULAR CANCER}

The introduction of platinum-based combination chemotherapy has made an impressive change in the treatment of patients with advanced testicular cancer. At present, chemotherapy is recommended for patients with stage IIC or stage III seminomas and nonseminomatous disease. Over 90\% of patients respond to chemotherapy and, depending upon the extent and severity of disease, complete remissions up to $70-80 \%$ are observed. Over $50 \%$ of patients achieving complete remission are cured with chemotherapy. In patients with good risk features, three cycles of cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (PEB
protocol) or four cycles of cisplatin and etoposide give virtually identical results. In patients with high-risk disease, the combination of cisplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamide can be used as well as etoposide and bleomycin with high-dose cisplatin.

\section*{MALI GNANT MELANOMA}

Once it has metastasized, malignant melanoma is one of the most difficult neoplasms to treat because it is a relatively drug-resistant neoplasm. Dacarbazine, temozolomide, and cisplatin are the most active cytotoxic agents for this disease. Biologic agents, including interferon-and interleukin-2 (IL-2), may have greater activity than traditional anticancer agents, and treatment with high-dose IL- 2 has led to cures in a small subset of patients. Several clinical studies are actively investigating the combination of biologic therapy with combination chemotherapy in what have been labeled biochemotherapy regimens. Thus far, overall response rates as well as complete response rates appear to be much higher with biochemotherapy regimens compared with chemotherapy alone. Unfortunately, treatment toxicity also seems to be increased. This approach remains investigational, and further studies are required to determine whether this approach can lead to improved patient survival.

\section*{BRAIN CANCER}

Chemotherapy has only limited efficacy in the treatment of malignant gliomas. In general, the nitrosoureas, because of their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, are the most active agents in this disease. Carmustine (BCNU) can be used as a single agent, or lomustine (CCNU) can be used in combination with procarbazine and vincristine (PCV regimen). In addition, the newer alkylating agent temozolomide has activity in the setting of recurrent disease, and it is approved for this indication. The histopathologic subtype oligodendroglioma has been shown to be especially chemosensitive, and the PCV regimen is the treatment of choice for this disease.

\section*{CHORI OCARCI NOMA}

This rare tumor arises from fetal trophoblastic tissue and was the first metastatic cancer cured with chemotherapy. Single-agent methotrexate produced complete regression of metastatic lesions, resulting in a high percentage of cures. At present, treatment with single-agent methotrexate or dactinomycin is recommended for low-risk disease, while intense combination regimens including methotrexate and leucovorin rescue, etoposide, dactinomycin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide are recommended for intermediate or high-risk disease.

\section*{Secondary Malignancies \& Cancer Chemotherapy}

The development of secondary malignancies is a late complication of some types of cancer chemotherapy. The most frequent secondary malignancy is acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The alkylating agents, procarbazine, etoposide, and ionizing radiation are all considered to be leukemogenic. AML has been observed in up to $15 \%$ of patients with Hodgkin's disease who have received radiotherapy plus MOPP chemotherapy and in patients with multiple myeloma, ovarian carcinoma, or breast carcinoma treated with melphalan. The increased risk of AML is observed as early as 2-4 years after the initiation of chemotherapy and peaks at 5 and 9 years. With improvements in the clinical efficacy of various combination chemotherapy regimens resulting in prolonged survival and in some cases actual cure of cancer, the issue of how second cancers may affect long-term survival assumes greater importance. There is already evidence that certain alkylating agents (eg, cyclophosphamide) may be less carcinogenic than others (eg,
melphalan). Systematic testing of the carcinogenicity of anticancer drugs in several animal models should allow less toxic agents to be identified and substituted for other more carcinogenic ones in chemotherapy regimens.

\section*{I MMUNOPHARMACOLOGY: I NTRODUCTION}

Agents that suppress the immune system play an important role in preventing the rejection of organ or tissue grafts and in the treatment of certain diseases that arise from dysregulation of the immune response. While precise details of the mechanisms of action of a number of these agents are still obscure, knowledge of the elements of the immune system is useful in understanding their effects. Agents that augment the immune response or selectively alter the balance of various components of the immune system are also becoming important in the management of certain diseases such as cancer, AIDS, and
autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. A growing number of other diseases (infections, cardiovascular diseases) may also be candidates for immune manipulation.

\section*{ELEMENTS OF THE I MMUNE SYSTEM NORMAL I MMUNE RESPONSES}

The immune system has evolved to protect the host from invading pathogens and to eliminate disease. At its functioning best, the immune system is exquisitely responsive to invading pathogens while retaining the capacity to recognize self antigens to which it is tolerant. Protection from infection and disease is provided by the collaborative efforts of the innate and adaptive immune systems.

\section*{The Innate Immune System}

The innate immune system is the first line of defense against an invading pathogen (antigen) and includes physical (eg, skin), biochemical (eg, complement, lysozyme, interferons), and cellular components (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, natural killer [NK], and natural killer-T [NKT] cells). An intact skin or mucosa is the first barrier to infection. When this barrier is breached, destruction of the pathogen (eg, bacteria, fungi, parasites) is accomplished by biochemical components such as lysozyme (which breaks down the protective peptidoglycan cell wall) and the split products arising from complement activation. Complement components (Figure 56-1) enhance macrophage and neutrophil phagocytosis by acting as opsonins (C3b) and chemoattractants (C3a, C5a) that recruit immune cells to inflammatory sites. The activation of complement eventually leads to pathogen lysis via the generation of a membrane attack complex that creates holes in the membrane and results in leakage of cellular components.

Role of complement in innate immunity. Complement is made up of nine proteins (C1-C9), which are split into fragments during activation. A: Complement components (C3a, C5a) attract phagocytes (1) to inflammatory sites (2), where they ingest and degrade pathogens (3). B: Complement components C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9 associate to form a membrane attack complex (MAC) that lyses bacteria, causing their destruction. C: Complement component C3b is an opsonin that coats bacteria (1) and facilitates their ingestion (2) and digestion (3) by phagocytes.

During the inflammatory response triggered by infection, neutrophils and monocytes enter the tissue sites from the peripheral circulation. This cellular influx is mediated by the release and action of chemoattractant cytokines (eg, IL-8 [CXCL8], macrophage chemotactic protein-1 [MCP-1; CCL2], and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 [MIP-1a; CCL3]) from activated endothelial cells and immune cells (mostly tissue macrophages) at the inflammatory site. It is triggered by the adhesion of cell surface receptors on the immune cells to ligands on the activated endothelial cell surface. If these events occur successfully, the invading pathogen is ingested, degraded, and eliminated, and disease is either prevented or is of short duration.

Natural killer (NK) and natural killer-T (NKT) cells recruited to the inflammatory site also contribute to the innate response by secreting interferon-gamma (IFN- $\gamma^{r}$ ), which activates resident tissue macrophages and dendritic cells. NK cells are so called because they are able to recognize and destroy virus-infected
normal cells as well as tumor cells without prior stimulation. This activity is regulated by so-called "killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors" (KIRs) on the NK cell surface that are specific for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. When NK cells bind self MHC class I proteins (expressed on all nucleated cells), these receptors deliver inhibitory signals, preventing them from killing normal host cells. Tumor cells or virus-infected cells that have down-regulated MHC class I expression do not engage these KIRs, resulting in activation of NK cells and subsequent destruction of the target cell. NK cells kill target cells by releasing cytotoxic granules that induce programmed cell death.

NKT cells express T-cell receptors as well as receptors commonly found on NK cells. NKT cells recognize microbial lipid antigens presented by a unique class of MHC-like molecules known as CD1 and have been implicated in host defense against microbial agents, autoimmune diseases, and tumors.

\section*{The Adaptive I mmune System}

The adaptive immune system is mobilized by cues from the innate response when the innate processes are incapable of coping with an infection. The adaptive immune system has a number of characteristics that contribute to its success in eliminating pathogens. These include the ability to (1) respond to a variety of antigens, each in a specific manner; (2) discriminate between foreign ("non-self") antigens (pathogens) and self antigens of the host; and (3) respond to a previously encountered antigen in a learned way by initiating a vigorous memory response. This adaptive response culminates in the production of antibodies, which are the effectors of humoral immunity; and the activation of T lymphocytes, which are the effectors of cell-mediated immunity.

The induction of specific adaptive immunity requires the participation of professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which include dendritic cells (DC), macrophages, and B lymphocytes. These cells play pivotal roles in the induction of an adaptive immune response because of their capacity to phagocytize or endocytose protein antigens, and enzymatically digest them to generate peptides, which are then loaded onto class I or class II MHC proteins and "presented" to the cell surface T-cell receptor (TCR) (Figure 56-2). CD8 T cells recognize class I-MHC peptide complexes while CD4 T cells recognize class II-MHC peptide complexes. At least two signals are necessary for the activation of T cells. The first signal is delivered following engagement of the TCR with peptide-bound MHC molecules. In the absence of a second signal, the T cells become unresponsive (anergic) or undergo apoptosis. The second signal involves ligation of costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80 [also known as B7-1], and CD86 [also known as B7-2]) on the antigen-presenting cell to their respective ligands (CD40L for CD40, CD28 for CD80 or CD86). Activation of T cells is regulated via a negative feedback loop involving another molecule known as T-lymphocyteassociated antigen 4 (CTLA-4). Following engagement of CD28 with CD80 or CD86, CTLA-4 in the cytoplasm is mobilized to the cell surface where, because of its higher affinity of binding to CD80 and CD86, it outcompetes or displaces CD28 and results in suppression of T-cell activation and proliferation. This property of CTLA-4 has been exploited as a strategy for sustaining a desirable immune response such as that directed against cancer. A recombinant humanized antibody that binds CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) prevents its association with CD80/CD86. In so doing, the activated state of T cells is sustained. Recently completed vaccine trials in metastatic melanoma patients receiving anti-CTLA-4 antibody reported objective clinical responses in a few of the treated patients. Unfortunately, these beneficial responses were associated with the development of autoimmune toxicity in some patients, raising concern about this approach.

\section*{Antigenpresenting cell}

Copyright ©2006 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.
T-cell activation by an antigen-presenting cell requires engagement of the T-cell receptor by the MHC-peptide complex (signal 1) and binding of the costimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86) on the dendritic cell to CD28 on the T cell (signal 2). The activation signals are strengthened by CD40/CD40L and ICAM-1/LFA-1 interactions. In a normal immune response, T -cell activation is regulated by T -cell-derived $\mathrm{CTLA}-4$, which binds to CD 80 or CD 86 with higher affinity than CD28 and sends inhibitory signals to the nucleus of the T cell.

T lymphocytes develop and learn to recognize self and non-self antigens in the thymus; those T cells that bind with high affinity to self antigens in the thymus undergo apoptosis (negative selection), while those that are capable of recognizing foreign antigens in the presence of self MHC molecules are retained and expanded (positive selection) for export to the periphery (lymph nodes, spleen, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, peripheral blood), where they become activated after encountering MHC-presented peptides (Figures 56-2 and 56-3).

Scheme of cellular interactions during the generation of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses (see text). The cell-mediated arm of the immune response involves the ingestion and digestion of antigen by antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages. Activated T H cells secrete IL-2, which causes proliferation and activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and TH1 and TH2 cell subsets. TH1 cells also produce IFN- $\gamma$ and TNF- $B$, which can directly activate macrophages and NK cells. The humoral response is triggered when B lymphocytes bind antigen via their surface immunoglobulin. They are then induced by TH2-derived IL- 4 and IL- 5 to proliferate and differentiate into memory cells and antibody-secreting plasma cells. Regulatory cytokines such as IFN- $\gamma$ and IL- 10 down-regulate T H 2 and T H 1
responses, respectively.

Studies using murine T-cell clones have demonstrated the presence of two subsets of T helper lymphocytes (Tн 1 and TH2) based on the cytokines they secrete after activation. This demarcation is not so clear-cut in humans. The TH1 subset characteristically produces interferon- $\gamma^{\prime}$ (IFN- $\gamma^{\prime}$ ), interleukin- 2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor-B (TNF-B) and induces cell-mediated immunity by activation of macrophages, cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), and NK cells. The The 2 subset produces IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 (and sometimes IL-13), which induce B-cell proliferation and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. IL- 10 produced by TH2 cells inhibits cytokine production by TH1 cells via the down-regulation of MHC expression by APCs. Conversely, IFN- $\gamma$ produced by TH1 cells inhibits the proliferation of TH2 cells (Figure 56-3). Although these subsets have been well described in vitro, the nature of the antigenic challenge that elicits a T H 1 or T н 2 phenotype is less clear. Extracellular bacteria typically cause the elaboration of T н 2 cytokines, culminating in the production of neutralizing or opsonic antibodies. In contrast, intracellular organisms (eg, mycobacteria) elicit the production of Th1 cytokines, which lead to the activation of effector cells such as macrophages. A less well defined T-cell subset (TH3) has been described that produces transforming growth factor- $B$ (TGF- $B$ ), whose numerous functions include down-regulation of proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes.

CD8 T lymphocytes recognize endogenously processed peptides presented by virus-infected cells or tumor cells. These peptides are usually nine-amino-acid fragments derived from virus or protein tumor antigens in the cytoplasm and are loaded onto MHC class I molecules (Figure 56-2) in the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, class II MHC molecules present peptides (usually 11-22 amino acids) derived from extracellular (exogenous) pathogens to CD4 T helper cells. In some instances, exogenous antigens, upon ingestion by APCs, can be presented on class I MHC molecules to CD8 T cells. This phenomenon is referred to as "crosspresentation" and is thought to be useful in generating effective immune responses against infected host cells that are incapable of priming T lymphocytes. Upon activation, CD8 T cells induce target cell death via lytic granule enzymes ("granzymes"), perforin, and the Fas-Fas ligand (Fas-FasL) apoptosis pathways.

B lymphocytes undergo selection in the bone marrow, during which self-reactive B lymphocytes are clonally deleted while B-cell clones specific for foreign antigens are retained and expanded. The repertoire of antigen specificities by T cells is genetically determined and arises from T -cell receptor gene rearrangement while the specificities of $B$ cells arise from immunoglobulin gene rearrangement; for both types of cells, these determinations occur prior to encounters with antigen. Upon an encounter with antigen, a mature B cell binds the antigen, internalizes and processes it, and presents its peptide bound to class II MHC to CD4 helper cells, which in turn secrete IL-4 and IL-5. These interleukins stimulate B-cell proliferation and differentiation into memory B cells and antibody-secreting plasma cells. The primary antibody response consists mostly of IgM-class immunoglobulins. Subsequent antigenic stimulation results in a vigorous "booster" response accompanied by class (isotype) switching to produce IgG, IgA, and IgE antibodies with diverse effector functions (Figure 56-3). These antibodies also undergo affinity maturation, which allows them to bind more efficiently to the antigen. With the passage of time, this results in accelerated elimination of microorganisms in subsequent infections. Antibodies mediate their functions by acting as opsonins to enhance phagocytosis and cellular cytotoxicity and by activating complement to elicit an inflammatory response and induce bacterial lysis (Figure 56-4).
Figure 56-4.

Antibody has multiple functions. The prototypical antibody consists of two heavy (H) and two light (L) chains, each subdivided into constant $\left(C_{L}, C_{H}\right)$ and variable $\left(V_{L}, V_{H}\right)$ domains. The structure is held together by intra- and interchain disulfide bridges. A: The complementarity-determining region (CDR) of the antigen-binding portion of the antibody engages the antigenic determinant (epitope) in a lock and key fashion. B: Antigen-antibody complexes activate complement to produce split complement components that cause bacterial lysis. C: The Fc portion of antibodies binds to Fc receptors on phagocytes (eg, macrophages, neutrophils) and facilitates uptake of bacteria (opsonization).

\section*{ABNORMAL IMMUNE RESPONSES}

Whereas the normally functioning immune response can successfully neutralize toxins, inactivate viruses, destroy transformed cells, and eliminate pathogens, inappropriate responses can lead to extensive tissue damage (hypersensitivity) or reactivity against self antigens (autoimmunity); conversely, impaired reactivity to appropriate targets (immunodeficiency) may occur and abrogate essential defense mechanisms.

\section*{Hypersensitivity}

Hypersensitivity can be classified as antibody-mediated or cell-mediated. Three types of hypersensitivity are antibody-mediated (types I-III), while the fourth is cell-mediated (type IV). Hypersensitivity occurs in two phases: the sensitization phase and the effector phase. Sensitization occurs upon initial encounter with an antigen; the effector phase involves immunologic memory and results in tissue pathology upon a subsequent encounter with that antigen.

\section*{I MMEDI ATE HYPERSENSITI VI TY}

Immediate, or type I, hypersensitivity is IgE-mediated, with symptoms usually occurring within minutes following the patient's encounter with antigen.

\section*{Type I}

Type I hypersensitivity results from cross-linking of membrane-bound IgE on blood basophils or tissue mast cells by antigen. This cross-linking causes cells to degranulate, releasing substances such as histamine, leukotrienes, and eosinophil chemotactic factor, which induce anaphylaxis, asthma, hay fever, or urticaria (hives) in affected individuals (Figure 56-5). A severe type I hypersensitivity reaction such as systemic anaphylaxis (eg, from insect envenomation, ingestion of certain foods, or drug hypersensitivity) requires immediate medical intervention.
Figure 56-5.

\section*{Sensitization phase}

Mechanism of type I hypersensitivity. Initial exposure to allergen (sensitization phase) leads to production of IgE by plasma cells differentiated from allergen-specific B cells (not shown). The secreted IgE binds IgE-specific receptors (FcE R) on blood basophils and tissue mast cells. Reexposure to allergen leads to cross-linking of membrane-bound IgE (effector phase). This cross-linking causes degranulation of cytoplasmic granules and release of mediators that induce vasodilation, smooth muscle contraction, and increased vascular permeability. These effects lead to the clinical symptoms characteristic of type I hypersensitivity.

\section*{Type II}

Type II hypersensitivity results from the formation of antigen-antibody complexes between foreign antigen and IgM or IgG immunoglobulins. One example of this type of hypersensitivity is a blood transfusion reaction that can occur if blood is not cross-matched properly. Preformed antibodies bind to red blood cell membrane antigens that activate the complement cascade, generating a membrane attack complex that
lyses the transfused red blood cells. In hemolytic disease of the newborn, anti-Rh IgG antibodies produced by an Rh-negative mother cross the placenta, bind to red blood cells of an Rh-positive fetus, and damage them. The disease is prevented in subsequent pregnancies by the administration of anti-Rh antibodies to the mother 24-48 hours after delivery (see Immunosuppressive Antibodies, below). Type II hypersensitivity can also be drug-induced and may occur during the administration of penicillin to allergic patients. In these patients, penicillin binds to red blood cells or other host tissue to form a neoantigen that evokes production of antibodies capable of inducing complement-mediated red cell lysis. In some circumstances, subsequent administration of the drug can lead to systemic anaphylaxis (type I hypersensitivity).

\section*{Type III}

Type III hypersensitivity is due to the presence of elevated levels of antigen-antibody complexes that deposit on basement membranes in tissues and vessels. Immune complex deposition activates complement to produce components with anaphylatoxic and chemotactic activities (C5a, C3a, C4a) that increase vascular permeability and recruit neutrophils to the site of complex deposition. Complex deposition and the action of lytic enzymes released by neutrophils can cause skin rashes, glomerulonephritis, and arthritis in these individuals. If patients have type III hypersensitivity against a particular antigen, clinical symptoms usually occur 3 to 4 days after exposure to the antigen.

\section*{TYPE IV: DELAYED-TYPE HYPERSENSITIVITY}

Unlike type I, II, and III hypersensitivities, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) is cell-mediated, and responses occur 2-3 days after exposure to the sensitizing antigen. DTH is caused by antigen-specific DTH T H 1 cells and induces a local inflammatory response that causes tissue damage characterized by the influx of antigen-non specific inflammatory cells, especially macrophages. These cells are recruited under the influence of TH1-produced cytokines (Figure 56-6), which chemoattract circulating monocytes and neutrophils, induce myelopoiesis, and activate macrophages. The activated macrophages are primarily responsible for the tissue damage associated with DTH. Although widely considered to be deleterious, DTH responses are very effective in eliminating infections caused by intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Leishmania species. Clinical manifestations of DTH include tuberculin and contact hypersensitivities. Tuberculosis exposure is determined using a DTH skin test. Positive responses show erythema and induration caused by accumulation of macrophages and DTH T cells at the site of the tuberculin injection. Poison ivy is the most common cause of contact hypersensitivity, in which pentadecacatechol, the lipophilic chemical in poison ivy, modifies cellular tissue and results in a DTH T-cell response.

Mechanism of type IV hypersensitivity (DTH). In the sensitization phase, the processed allergen (eg, from poison oak) is presented to CD4 T H 1 cells by antigen-presenting cells in association with class II MHC. T cells are induced to express IL-2 receptors and are stimulated to proliferate and differentiate into memory $\mathrm{T}_{\text {DTH }}$ cells. Secondary contact with antigen triggers the effector phase, in which memory $\mathrm{T}_{\text {DTH }}$ cells release cytokines that attract and activate nonspecific inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils. These cells display increased phagocytic and microbicidal activities and release large quantities of lytic enzymes that cause extensive tissue damage.

\section*{Autoimmunity}

Autoimmune disease arises when the body mounts an immune response against itself due to failure to distinguish self tissues and cells from foreign (nonself) antigens. This phenomenon derives from the activation of self-reactive T and B lymphocytes that generate cell-mediated or humoral immune responses directed against self antigens. The pathologic consequences of this reactivity constitute several types of autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases are highly complex due to MHC genetics, environmental conditions, infectious entities, and dysfunctional immune regulation. Examples of such diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 1 diabetes). In rheumatoid arthritis, IgM antibodies (rheumatoid factors) are produced that react with the Fc portion of IgG and may form immune complexes that activate the complement cascade, causing chronic inflammation of the joints and kidneys. In systemic lupus erythematosus, antibodies are made against DNA, histones, red blood cells, platelets, and other cellular components. In multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes, cell-mediated autoimmune attack destroys myelin surrounding nerve cells and insulinproducing islet B (beta) cells of the pancreas, respectively. In type 1 diabetes, activated CD4 $\mathrm{T}_{\text {DTH }}$ cells that infiltrate the islets of Langerhans and recognize self islet B cell peptides are thought to produce cytokines that stimulate macrophages to produce lytic enzymes, which destroy islet B cells. Autoantibodies directed against the islet B cell antigens are produced, but do not contribute significantly to disease.

A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain autoimmunity:
(1) Exposure of self-reactive T lymphocytes to antigens previously sequestered from the immune system (eg, lens protein, myelin basic protein).
(2) Molecular mimicry by invading pathogens, in which immune responses are directed at antigenic determinants on pathogens that share identical or similar epitopes with normal host tissue. This phenomenon occurs in rheumatic fever following Streptococcus pyogenes infection, in which heart damage is thought to arise from an immune response directed against streptococcal antigens shared with heart muscle. The suggested viral etiology of autoimmune diseases has been ascribed to immune responses (both cell-mediated and humoral) directed against virus epitopes that mimic sequestered self antigens.
(3) Inappropriate expression of class II MHC molecules on the membranes of cells that normally do not express class II MHC (eg, islet Bcells). Increased expression of MHC II may increase presentation of self peptides to T helper cells, which in turn induce CTL, $\mathrm{T}_{\text {DTH }}$, and B -lymphocyte cells that react against self antigens.

\section*{I mmunodeficiency Diseases}

Immunodeficiency diseases result from inadequate function in the immune system; the consequences include increased susceptibility to infections and prolonged duration and severity of disease. Immunodeficiency diseases are either congenitally acquired or arise from extrinsic factors such as bacterial or viral infections or drug treatment. Affected individuals frequently succumb to infections caused by opportunistic organisms of low pathogenicity for the immunocompetent host. Examples of congenitally acquired immunodeficiency disease include X-linked agammaglobulinemia, DiGeorge's syndrome, and severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) due to adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency.

X-linked agammaglobulinemia is a disease affecting males that is characterized by a failure of immature Blymphocytes to mature into antibody-producing plasma cells. These individuals are susceptible to recurrent bacterial infections, although the cell-mediated responses directed against viruses and fungi are preserved. DiGeorge's syndrome is due to failure of the thymus to develop, resulting in diminished T-cell responses ( $\mathrm{T}_{\text {DTH }}, \mathrm{CTL}$ ), while the humoral response is unaffected.

The ADA enzyme normally prevents the accumulation of toxic deoxy-ATP in cells. Deoxy-ATP is particularly toxic to lymphocytes, and leads to death of T and B cells. Absence of the enzyme therefore results in SCID. Infusion of the purified enzyme (pegademase, from bovine sources) and transfer of ADA gene-modified lymphocytes have both been used successfully to treat this disease.

AIDS represents the classic example of immunodeficiency disease caused by extrinsic factors, in this instance the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This virus exhibits a strong tropism for CD4 T helper cells; these become depleted, giving rise to increased frequency of opportunistic infections and malignancies in infected individuals. AIDS is also characterized by an imbalance in Th1 and Th2 cells, and the ratios of cells and their functions are skewed toward TH2. This results in hypergammaglobulinemia, loss of cytotoxic lymphocyte activity, and delayed hypersensitivity.

Immunosuppressive agents have proved very useful in minimizing the occurrence or impact of deleterious effects of exaggerated or inappropriate immune responses. Unfortunately, these agents also have the potential to cause disease and to increase the risk of infection and malignancies.

\section*{IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE AGENTS GLUCOCORTI COI DS}

Glucocorticoids (corticosteroids) were the first hormonal agents recognized as having lympholytic properties. Administration of any glucocorticoid reduces the size and lymphoid content of the lymph nodes and spleen, although it has no toxic effect on proliferating myeloid or erythroid stem cells in the bone marrow.

Glucocorticoids are thought to interfere with the cell cycle of activated lymphoid cells. The details of the mechanism of their action are described in Chapter 39. Glucocorticoids are quite cytotoxic to certain subsets of T cells, but their immunologic effects are probably due to their ability to modify cellular functions rather than to direct cytotoxicity. Although cellular immunity is more affected than humoral immunity, the primary antibody response can be diminished, and with continued use, previously established antibody responses are also decreased. Additionally, continuous administration of corticosteroid increases the fractional catabolic rate of IgG, the major class of antibody immunoglobulins, thus lowering the effective concentration of specific antibodies. Contact hypersensitivity mediated by DTH T cells, for example, is usually abrogated by glucocorticoid therapy.

Glucocorticoids are used in a wide variety of conditions (see Table 56-1). It is thought that the immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties of corticosteroids account for their beneficial effects in diseases like idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and rheumatoid arthritis. Glucocorticoids modulate allergic reactions and are useful in the treatment of diseases like asthma or as premedication for other agents (eg, blood products, chemotherapy) that might cause undesirable immune responses.
Glucocorticoids are first-line immunosuppressive therapy for both solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, with variable results. The toxicities of long-term glucocorticoid therapy can be severe and are discussed in Chapter 39.

\section*{I MMUNOPHI LI N LI GANDS}

\section*{Cyclosporine}

Cyclosporine (cyclosporin A, CSA) is an immunosuppressive agent with efficacy in human organ transplantation, in the treatment of graft-versus-host disease after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and in the treatment of selected autoimmune disorders. Cyclosporine is a peptide antibiotic that appears to act at an early stage in the antigen receptor-induced differentiation of T cells and blocks their activation. Cyclosporine binds to cyclophilin, a member of a class of intracellular proteins called immunophilins. Cyclosporine and cyclophilin form a complex that inhibits the cytoplasmic phosphatase, calcineurin, which is necessary for the activation of a T-cell-specific transcription factor. This transcription factor, NF-AT, is involved in the synthesis of interleukins (eg, IL-2) by activated T cells. In vitro studies have indicated that cyclosporine inhibits the gene transcription of IL-2, IL-3, IFN- $\gamma$, and other factors produced by antigenstimulated T cells, but it does not block the effect of such factors on primed T cells nor does it block interaction with antigen.

Cyclosporine may be given intravenously or orally, though it is slowly and incompletely absorbed ( $20-50 \%$ ). The absorbed drug is primarily metabolized by the P450 3A enzyme system in the liver with resultant multiple drug interactions. This propensity for drug interaction contributes to significant interpatient variability in bioavailability, such that cyclosporine requires individual patient dosage adjustments based on steady-state blood levels and the desired therapeutic ranges for the drug. Cyclosporine ophthalmic solution is now available for severe dry eye syndrome, as well as ocular graft-versus-host disease. Inhaled cyclosporine is being investigated for use in lung transplantation.

Toxicities are numerous and include nephrotoxicity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, liver dysfunction, hyperkalemia, altered mental status, seizures, and hirsutism. Cyclosporine causes very little bone marrow toxicity. While an increased incidence of lymphoma and other cancers (Kaposi's sarcoma, skin cancer) have been observed in transplant recipients receiving cyclosporine, other immunosuppressive agents may also
predispose recipients to cancer. Some evidence suggests that tumors may arise after cyclosporine treatment because the drug induces TGF-B, which promotes tumor invasion and metastasis.

Cyclosporine may be used alone or in combination with other immunosuppressants, particularly glucocorticoids. It has been used successfully as the sole immunosuppressant for cadaveric transplants of the kidney, pancreas, and liver, and it has proved extremely useful in cardiac transplants as well. In combination with methotrexate, cyclosporine is a standard prophylactic regimen to prevent graft-versushost disease after allogeneic stem cell transplants. Cyclosporine has also proved useful in a variety of autoimmune disorders, including uveitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and asthma. Its combination with newer agents is showing considerable efficacy in clinical and experimental settings where effective and less toxic immunosuppression is needed. Newer formulations of cyclosporine have been developed that are improving patient compliance (smaller, better tasting pills), and increasing bioavailability.

\section*{Tacrolimus}

Tacrolimus (FK 506) is an immunosuppressant macrolide antibiotic produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis. It is not chemically related to cyclosporine, but their mechanisms of action are similar. Both drugs bind to cytoplasmic peptidyl-prolyl isomerases that are abundant in all tissues. While cyclosporine binds to cyclophilin, tacrolimus binds to the immunophilin FK-binding protein (FKBP). Both complexes inhibit calcineurin, which is necessary for the activation of the T-cell-specific transcription factor NF-AT.

On a weight basis, tacrolimus is 10-100 times more potent than cyclosporine in inhibiting immune responses. Tacrolimus is utilized for the same indications as cyclosporine, particularly in organ and stem cell transplantation. Multicenter studies in the USA and in Europe indicate that both graft and patient survival are similar for the two drugs. Tacrolimus has been proven to be effective therapy for preventing rejection in solid-organ transplant patients even after failure of standard rejection therapy, including anti-Tcell antibodies. It is now considered a standard prophylactic agent (usually in combination with methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil) for graft-versus-host disease.

Tacrolimus can be administered orally or intravenously. The half-life of the intravenous form is approximately 9-12 hours. Like cyclosporine, tacrolimus is metabolized primarily by P450 enzymes in the liver, and there is potential for drug interactions. The dosage is determined by trough blood level at steady state. Its toxic effects are similar to those of cyclosporine and include nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, hyperglycemia, hypertension, hyperkalemia, and gastrointestinal complaints.

Because of the effectiveness of systemic tacrolimus in some dermatologic diseases, a topical preparation is now available. Tacrolimus ointment is currently used in the therapy of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.

\section*{Sirolimus}

Sirolimus (rapamycin) is derived from Streptomyces hygroscopicus and binds immunophilins and inhibits calcineurin, as do cyclosporine and tacrolimus. However, it does not block interleukin production by activated T cells but instead blocks the response of T cells to cytokines. In vitro, it antagonizes tacrolimusinduced T-cell responses but seems to be synergistic with cyclosporine. Furthermore, it is a potent inhibitor of B-cell proliferation and immunoglobulin production. Sirolimus also inhibits the mononuclear cell proliferative response to colony-stimulating factors and suppresses hematopoietic recovery after myelotoxic treatment in mice.

Sirolimus is available only as an oral drug. It is rapidly absorbed and its elimination is similar to that of
cyclosporine and tacrolimus, being a substrate for both cytochrome P450 3A and P-glycoprotein. Significant drug interactions can occur, and the drug level in the blood may need to be monitored.

Sirolimus has been used effectively alone and in combination with other immunosuppressants (corticosteroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil) to prevent rejection of solid organ allografts. Sirolimus is being investigated as therapy for steroid-refractory acute and chronic graft-versushost disease in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Topical sirolimus is also used in some dermatologic disorders and, in combination with cyclosporine, in the management of uveoretinitis. Recently, sirolimus-eluting coronary stents have been shown to reduce restenosis and additional adverse cardiac events in patients with severe coronary artery disease, due to its antiproliferative effects. A derivative of sirolimus, everolimus, is a proliferation-signal inhibitor that may be of benefit in decreasing rejection in cardiac transplantation.

Toxicities of sirolimus can include profound myelosuppression (especially thrombocytopenia), hepatotoxicity, diarrhea, hypertriglyceridemia, and headache.

\section*{MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL}

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a semisynthetic derivative of mycophenolic acid, isolated from the mold Penicillium glaucum. In vitro, it inhibits T- and B-lymphocyte responses, including mitogen and mixed lymphocyte responses, probably by inhibition of de novo synthesis of purines. Mycophenolate mofetil is hydrolyzed to mycophenolic acid, the active immunosuppressive moiety; it is synthesized and administered as MMF to enhance bioavailability. Mycophenolate mofetil is used in solid organ transplant patients for refractory rejection and, in combination with prednisone, as an alternative to cyclosporine or tacrolimus in patients who do not tolerate those drugs. Mycophenolate mofetil is used to treat steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. It is also used in combination with tacrolimus or other immunosuppressants as prophylaxis to prevent graft-versus-host disease. Newer immunosuppressant applications for MMF include lupus nephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and some dermatologic disorders.

Mycophenolate mofetil is available in both oral and intravenous forms. The oral form is rapidly metabolized to mycophenolic acid but not by the cytochrome P450 3A system, though some drug interactions still occur.

Toxicities include gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain) headache, hypertension and reversible myelosuppression (primarily neutropenia).

\section*{THALI DOMI DE}

Thalidomide is a sedative drug that was withdrawn from the market in the 1960s because of its disastrous teratogenic effects when used during pregnancy. Nevertheless, it has significant immunomodulatory actions and is currently in active use or in clinical trials for over 40 different illnesses. Thalidomide inhibits angiogenesis and has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. It inhibits TNF-a., reduces phagocytosis by neutrophils, increases production of IL-10, alters adhesion molecule expression, and enhances cell-mediated immunity via interactions with T cells. The complex actions of thalidomide continue to be studied as its clinical use evolves.

Thalidomide is currently used in the treatment of multiple myeloma at initial diagnosis and for relapsedrefractory disease. Patients generally show signs of response within 2-3 months of starting the drug, with response rates from 20 to $70 \%$. When combined with dexamethasone, the response rates in myeloma are
$90 \%$ or more in some studies. Many patients have durable responses-up to $12-18$ months in refractory disease and even longer in some patients treated at diagnosis. The success of thalidomide in myeloma has lead to numerous clinical trials in other diseases such as myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukemia, and graft-versus-host disease, as well as in solid tumors like colon cancer, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and prostate cancer, with variable results to date. Thalidomide has been used for many years in the treatment of some manifestations of leprosy and has been reintroduced in the USA for erythema nodosum leprosum; it is also useful in management of the skin manifestations of lupus erythematosus.

The adverse effect profile of thalidomide is extensive. The most important toxicity is teratogenesis. Because of this effect, thalidomide prescription and use is closely regulated by the manufacturer. Other adverse effects of thalidomide include peripheral neuropathy, constipation, rash, fatigue, hypothyroidism, and increased risk of deep vein thrombosis. Thrombosis is sufficiently frequent, particularly in the myeloma population, that most patients are placed on warfarin when thalidomide treatment is initiated.

Owing to thalidomide's serious toxicity profile, considerable effort has been expended in the development of analogs. Immunomodulatory derivatives of thalidomide are termed I MiDs. Some I MiDs are much more potent than thalidomide in regulating cytokines and affecting T-cell proliferation. Lenalidomide is an IMiD that in animal and in vitro studies has been shown to be similar to thalidomide in action, but with less toxicity, especially teratogenicity. Lenalidomide was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in late 2005 as a consequence of trials that showed its effectiveness in the treatment of the myelodysplastic syndrome with the chromosome 5q31 deletion. Several clinical trials using lenalidomide to treat relapsed or refractory myeloma are showing benefits and it is likely to be approved by the FDA for that indication as well.

CC-4047 (Actimid) is another IMiD that is being investigated for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloma, and prostate cancer.

Another group of thalidomide analogs, selective cytokine inhibitory drugs (SelClDs), are phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitors with potent anti-TNF-activity but no T-cell co-stimulatory activity. Several SelCIDs are currently under investigation for clinical use.

\section*{CYTOTOXI C AGENTS}

\section*{Azathioprine}

Azathioprine is a prodrug of mercaptopurine and, like mercaptopurine, functions as an antimetabolite (see Chapter 55). Although its action is presumably mediated by conversion to mercaptopurine and further metabolites, it has been more widely used than mercaptopurine for immunosuppression in humans. These agents represent prototypes of the antimetabolite group of cytotoxic immunosuppressive drugs, and many other agents that kill proliferative cells appear to work at a similar level in the immune response.

Azathioprine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is metabolized primarily to mercaptopurine. Xanthine oxidase splits much of the active material to 6 -thiouric acid prior to excretion in the urine. After administration of azathioprine, small amounts of unchanged drug and mercaptopurine are also excreted by the kidney, and as much as a twofold increase in toxicity may occur in anephric or anuric patients. Since much of the drug's inactivation depends on xanthine oxidase, patients who are also receiving allopurinol (see Chapters 36 and 55) for control of hyperuricemia should have the dose of azathioprine reduced to one-fourth to one-third the usual amount to prevent excessive toxicity.

Azathioprine and mercaptopurine appear to produce immunosuppression by interfering with purine nucleic acid metabolism at steps that are required for the wave of lymphoid cell proliferation that follows antigenic stimulation. The purine analogs are thus cytotoxic agents that destroy stimulated lymphoid cells. Although continued messenger RNA synthesis is necessary for sustained antibody synthesis by plasma cells, these analogs appear to have less effect on this process than on nucleic acid synthesis in proliferating cells. Cellular immunity as well as primary and secondary serum antibody responses can be blocked by these cytotoxic agents.

Azathioprine and mercaptopurine appear to be of definite benefit in maintaining renal allografts and may be of value in transplantation of other tissues. These antimetabolites have been used with some success in the management of acute glomerulonephritis and in the renal component of systemic lupus erythematosus. They have also proved useful in some cases of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and multiple sclerosis. The drugs have been of occasional use in prednisone-resistant antibody-mediated idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and autoimmune hemolytic anemias.

The chief toxic effect of azathioprine and mercaptopurine is bone marrow suppression, usually manifested as leukopenia, although anemia and thrombocytopenia may occur. Skin rashes, fever, nausea and vomiting, and sometimes diarrhea occur, with the gastrointestinal symptoms seen mainly at higher dosages. Hepatic dysfunction, manifested by very high serum alkaline phosphatase levels and mild jaundice, occurs occasionally, particularly in patients with preexisting hepatic dysfunction.

\section*{Cyclophosphamide}

The alkylating agent cyclophosphamide is one of the most efficacious immunosuppressive drugs available. Cyclophosphamide destroys proliferating lymphoid cells (see Chapter 55) but also appears to alkylate some resting cells. It has been observed that very large doses (eg, > $120 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ intravenously over several days) may induce an apparent specific tolerance to a new antigen if the drug is administered simultaneously with, or shortly after, the antigen. In smaller doses, it has been effective against autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus) and in patients with acquired factor XIII antibodies and bleeding syndromes, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, antibody-induced pure red cell aplasia, and Wegener's granulomatosis.

Treatment with large doses of cyclophosphamide carries considerable risk of pancytopenia and hemorrhagic cystitis and therefore is generally combined with stem cell rescue (transplant) procedures. Although cyclophosphamide appears to induce tolerance for marrow or immune cell grafting, its use does not prevent the subsequent graft-versus-host disease syndrome, which may be serious or lethal if the donor is a poor histocompatibility match (despite the severe immunosuppression induced by high doses of cyclophosphamide). Other adverse effects of cyclophosphamide include nausea, vomiting, cardiac toxicity, and electrolyte disturbances.

\section*{Leflunomide}

Leflunomide is a prodrug of an inhibitor of pyrimidine synthesis (rather than purine synthesis). It is orally active, and the active metabolite has a long half-life of several weeks. Thus, the drug should be started with a loading dose, but it can be taken once daily after reaching steady state. It is approved only for rheumatoid arthritis at present, though studies are underway combining leflunomide with mycophenolate mofetil for a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory skin disorders, as well as preservation of allografts in solid organ transplantation. Leflunomide also appears (from murine data) to have antiviral activity.

Toxicities include elevation of liver enzymes with some risk of liver damage, renal impairment, and teratogenic effects. A low frequency of cardiovascular effects (angina, tachycardia) was reported in clinical trials of leflunomide.

\section*{Hydroxychloroquine}

Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial agent with immunosuppressant properties. It is thought to suppress intracellular antigen processing and loading of peptides onto MHC class II molecules by increasing the pH of lysosomal and endosomal compartments, thereby decreasing T-cell activation.

Because of these immunosuppressant activities, hydroxychloroquine is used to treat some autoimmune disorders, eg, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. It has also been used to both treat and prevent graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

\section*{Other Cytotoxic Agents}

Other cytotoxic agents, including vincristine, methotrexate, and cytarabine (see Chapter 55), also have immunosuppressive properties. Methotrexate has been used extensively in rheumatoid arthritis (see Chapter 36) and in the treatment of graft-versus-host disease. Although the other agents can be used for immunosuppression, their use has not been as widespread as the purine antagonists, and their indications for immunosuppression are less certain. The use of methotrexate (which can be given orally) appears reasonable in patients with idiosyncratic reactions to purine antagonists. The antibiotic dactinomycin has also been used with some success at the time of impending renal transplant rejection. Vincristine appears to be quite useful in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura refractory to prednisone. The related vinca alkaloid vinblastine has been shown to prevent mast cell degranulation in vitro by binding to microtubule units within the cell and to prevent release of histamine and other vasoactive compounds. Pentostatin is an adenosine deaminase inhibitor primarily used as an antineoplastic agent for lymphoid malignancies, and produces a profound lymphopenia. It is now frequently used for steroid-resistant graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, as well as in preparative regimens prior to those transplants to provide severe immunosuppression to prevent allograft rejection.

\section*{I MMUNOSUPPRESSI VE ANTI BODI ES}

The development of hybridoma technology by Milstein and Kohler in 1975 revolutionized the antibody field and radically increased the purity and specificity of antibodies used in the clinic and for diagnostic tests in the laboratory. Hybridomas consist of antibody-forming cells fused to immortal plasmacytoma cells. Hybrid cells that are stable and produce the required antibody can be subcloned for mass culture for antibody production. Large-scale fermentation facilities are now used for this purpose in the pharmaceutical industry.

More recently, molecular biology has been used to develop monoclonal antibodies. Combinatorial libraries of cDNAs encoding immunoglobulin heavy and light chains expressed on bacteriophage surfaces are screened against purified antigens. The result is an antibody fragment with specificity and high affinity for the antigen of interest. This technique has been used to develop antibodies specific for viruses (eg, HIV), bacterial proteins, tumor antigens, and even cytokines. Several antibodies developed in this manner are in clinical trials.

Other genetic engineering techniques involve production of chimeric and humanized versions of murine monoclonal antibodies in order to reduce their antigenicity and increase the half-life of the antibody in the patient. Murine antibodies administered as such to human patients evoke production of human antimouse
antibodies (HAMA), which clear the original murine proteins very rapidly. Humanization involves replacing most of the murine antibody with equivalent human regions while keeping only the variable, antigenspecific regions intact. Chimeric mouse-human antibodies have similar properties with less complete replacement of the murine components. The current naming convention for these engineered substances uses the suffix "umab" or "zumab" for humanized antibodies, and "imab" or "ximab" for chimeric products. These procedures have been successful in reducing or preventing HAMA production for many of the antibodies discussed below.

\section*{Antilymphocyte \& Antithymocyte Antibodies}

Antisera directed against lymphocytes have been prepared sporadically for over 100 years. With the advent of human organ transplantation as a therapeutic option, heterologous antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) took on new importance. ALG and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) are now in clinical use in many medical centers, especially in transplantation programs. The antiserum is usually obtained by immunization of large animals such as horses or sheep with human lymphoid cells.

Antilymphocyte antibody acts primarily on the small, long-lived peripheral lymphocytes that circulate between the blood and lymph. With continued administration, "thymus-dependent" lymphocytes from lymphoid follicles are also depleted, as they normally participate in the recirculating pool. As a result of the destruction or inactivation of T cells, an impairment of delayed hypersensitivity and cellular immunity occurs while humoral antibody formation remains relatively intact. ALG and ATG are useful for suppressing certain major compartments (ie, T cells) of the immune system and play a definite role in the management of solid organ and bone marrow transplantation.

Monoclonal antibodies directed against specific antigens such as CD3, CD4, CD25, CD40, IL-2 receptor, and TNF (discussed below) much more selectively influence T-cell subset function. The high specificity of these antibodies improves selectivity and reduces toxicity of the therapy and alters the disease course in several different autoimmune disorders.

In the management of transplants, ALG and monoclonal antibodies can be used in the induction of immunosuppression, in the treatment of initial rejection, and in the treatment of steroid-resistant rejection. There has been some success in the use of ALG and ATG plus cyclosporine to prepare recipients for bone marrow transplantation. In this procedure, the recipient is treated with ALG or ATG in large doses for 7-10 days prior to transplantation of bone marrow cells from the donor. Residual ALG appears to destroy the T cells in the donor marrow graft, and the probability of severe graft-versus-host syndrome is reduced.

The adverse effects of ALG are mostly those associated with injection of a foreign protein obtained from heterologous serum. Local pain and erythema often occur at the injection site (type III hypersensitivity). Since the humoral antibody mechanism remains active, skin-reactive and precipitating antibodies may be formed against the foreign IgG. Similar reactions occur with monoclonal antibodies of murine origin, and reactions thought to be caused by the release of cytokines by T cells and monocytes have also been described.

Anaphylactic and serum sickness reactions to ALG and murine monoclonal antibodies have been observed and usually require cessation of therapy. Complexes of host antibodies with horse ALG may precipitate and localize in the glomeruli of the kidneys. Even more disturbing has been the development of histiocytic lymphomas in the buttock at the site of ALG injection. The incidence of lymphoma as well as other forms of cancer is increased in kidney transplant patients. It appears likely that part of the increased risk of cancer
is related to the suppression of a normally potent defense system against oncogenic viruses or transformed cells. The preponderance of lymphoma in these cancer cases is thought to be related to the concurrence of chronic immune suppression with chronic low-level lymphocyte proliferation.

\section*{Muromonab-CD3}

Monoclonal antibodies against T-cell surface proteins are increasingly being used in the clinic for autoimmune disorders and in transplantation settings. Clinical studies have shown that the murine monoclonal antibody muromonab-CD3 (OKT3) directed against the CD3 molecule on the surface of human thymocytes and mature T cells can also be useful in the treatment of renal transplant rejection. In vitro, muromonab-CD3 blocks killing by cytotoxic human T cells and several other T -cell functions. In a prospective randomized multicenter trial with cadaveric renal transplants, use of muromonab-CD3 (along with lower doses of steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs) proved more effective at reversing acute rejection than did conventional steroid treatment. Muromonab-CD3 is approved for the treatment of renal allograft rejection crises. Several other monoclonal antibodies directed against surface markers on lymphocytes are approved for certain indications (see Monoclonal Antibodies section below), while others are in various stages of development and clinical trials.

\section*{I mmune Globulin Intravenous (I GI V)}

A quite different approach to immunomodulation is the intravenous use of polyclonal human immunoglobulin. This immunoglobulin preparation (usually IgG) is prepared from pools of thousands of healthy donors, and no specific antigen is the target of the "therapeutic antibody." Rather, one expects that the pool of different antibodies will have a normalizing effect upon the patient's immune networks.

IGIV in high doses ( $2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) has proved effective in a variety of different conditions ranging from immunoglobulin deficiencies to autoimmune disorders to HIV disease to bone marrow transplants. In patients with Kawasaki's disease, it has been shown to be safe and effective, reducing systemic inflammation and preventing coronary artery aneurysms. It has also brought about good clinical responses in systemic lupus erythematosus and refractory idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Possible mechanisms of action of IGIV include a reduction of T helper cells, increase of suppressor T cells, decreased spontaneous immunoglobulin production, Fc receptor blockade, increased antibody catabolism, and idiotypic-anti-idiotypic interactions with "pathologic antibodies." Although its precise mechanism of action is still controversial, IGIV brings undeniable clinical benefit to many patients with a variety of immune syndromes.

\section*{Rho (D) Immune Globulin Micro-Dose}

One of the earliest major advances in immunopharmacology was the development of a technique for preventing Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn. The technique is based on the observation that a primary antibody response to a foreign antigen can be blocked if specific antibody to that antigen is administered passively at the time of exposure to antigen. $\mathrm{Rh}_{\mathrm{o}}(\mathrm{D})$ immune globulin is a concentrated ( $15 \%$ ) solution of human IgG containing a higher titer of antibodies against the $\mathrm{Rh}_{\mathrm{o}}(\mathrm{D})$ antigen of the red cell.

Sensitization of Rh-negative mothers to the $D$ antigen occurs usually at the time of birth of an $R h_{0}$ (D)positive or $\mathrm{D}^{\text {u }}$-positive infant, when fetal red cells may leak into the mother's bloodstream. Sensitization might also occur occasionally with miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies. In subsequent pregnancies, maternal antibody against Rh-positive cells is transferred to the fetus during the third trimester, leading to
the development of erythroblastosis fetalis (hemolytic disease of the newborn).
If an injection of $\mathrm{Rh}_{\mathrm{o}}(\mathrm{D})$ antibody is administered to the mother within 24-72 hours after the birth of an Rh-positive infant, the mother's own antibody response to the foreign $R h_{0}$ (D)-positive cells is suppressed because the infant's red cells are cleared from circulation before the mother can generate a B-cell response against $\mathrm{Rh}_{\mathrm{o}}(\mathrm{D})$. Therefore she has no memory B cells that can activate upon subsequent pregnancies with an $\mathrm{Rh}_{\mathrm{o}}(\mathrm{D})$-positive fetus.

When the mother has been treated in this fashion, Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn has not been observed in subsequent pregnancies. For this prophylactic treatment to be successful, the mother must be $R h_{0}(D)$-negative and $D^{u}$-negative and must not already be immunized to the $R h_{0}(D)$ factor. Treatment is also often advised for Rh-negative mothers who have had miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, or abortions, when the blood type of the fetus is unknown. Note: $\mathrm{Rh}_{\mathrm{o}}(\mathrm{D})$ immune globulin is administered to the mother and must not be given to the infant.

The usual dose of $\mathrm{Rh}_{\mathrm{o}}$ (D) immune globulin is 2 mL intramuscularly, containing approximately 300 mcg anti$\mathrm{Rh}_{\mathrm{o}}$ (D) IgG. Adverse reactions are infrequent and consist of local discomfort at the injection site or, rarely, a slight temperature elevation.

\section*{Hyperimmune Immunoglobulins}

Hyperimmune immunoglobulin preparations are IGIV preparations made from pools of selected human or animal donors with high titers of antibodies against particular agents of interest such as viruses or toxins (see also Appendix I). Various hyperimmune IGIVs are available for treatment of respiratory syncytial virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster, human herpesvirus 3, hepatitis B virus, rabies, tetanus, and digoxin overdose. Intravenous administration of the hyperimmune globulins is a passive transfer of high titer antibodies that either reduces risk or reduces the severity of infection. Rabies hyperimmune globulin is injected around the wound and given intravenously. Tetanus hyperimmune globulin is administered intravenously when indicated for prophylaxis. Rattlesnake and coral snake hyperimmune globulins (antivenins) are of equine origin and are effective for North and South American rattlesnakes and some coral snakes (but not Arizona coral snake). Equine and ovine antivenins are available for rattlesnake envenomations, but only equine antivenin is available for coral snake bite. The ovine antivenin is a Fab preparation and is less immunogenic than whole equine IgG antivenins, but retains the ability to neutralize the rattlesnake venom.

\section*{MONOCLONAL ANTI BODIES (MABS)}

Recent advances in the ability to manipulate the genes of immunoglobulins have resulted in development of a wide array of humanized and chimeric monoclonal antibodies directed against therapeutic targets. The only murine elements of humanized monoclonal antibodies are the complementarity-determining regions in the variable domains of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. Complementarity-determining regions are primarily responsible for the antigen-binding capacity of antibodies. Chimeric antibodies typically contain antigen-binding murine variable regions and human constant regions. The following are brief descriptions of the engineered antibodies that have been approved by the FDA.

\section*{Antitumor MABs}

Alemtuzumab is a humanized $\mathrm{IgG}_{1}$ with a kappa chain that binds to CD52 found on normal and malignant B and T lymphocytes, NK cells, monocytes, macrophages, and a small population of granulocytes.

Currently, alemtuzumab is approved for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia in patients who have been treated with alkylating agents and have failed fludarabine therapy. Alemtuzumab appears to deplete leukemic and normal cells by direct antibody-dependent lysis. Patients receiving this antibody become lymphopenic and may also become neutropenic, anemic, and thrombocytopenic. As a result patients should be closely monitored for opportunistic infections and hematologic toxicity.

Bevacizumab is a humanized IgG $_{1}$ monoclonal antibody that binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inhibits VEGF from binding to its receptor, especially on endothelial cells. It is an antiangiogenic drug that has been shown to inhibit growth of blood vessels (angiogenesis) in tumors. It is approved for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer alone or in combination with 5-FU-based chemotherapy. Since bevacizumab is antiangiogenic, it should not be administered until patients heal from surgery. Patients taking the drug should be watched for hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforations, and wound healing problems.

Cetuximab is a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Binding of cetuximab to EGFR inhibits tumor cell growth by a variety of mechanisms, including decreases in kinase activity, matrix metalloproteinase activity, and growth factor production, and increased apoptosis. It is indicated for use in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose tumors overexpress EGFR. Cetuximab may be administered in combination with irinotecan or alone in patients who cannot tolerate irinotecan.

Gemtuzumab is a humanized $\operatorname{IgG}_{4}$ monoclonal antibody with a kappa light chain specific for CD33, a sialoadhesion protein found on leukemic blast cells in 80-90\% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Gemtuzumab alone has some antiblast activity. In the clinical formulation, gemtuzumab is coupled to the cytotoxic agent, ozogamicin, which is a semisynthetic derivative of calicheamicin, an antibiotic with antitumor activity. Internalization of gemtuzumab-ozogamicin by the tumor cell results in release of the cytotoxin from the antibody in the lysosome. Ozogamicin then binds to the minor groove in DNA, causing double-strand breaks and cell death.

Gemtuzumab is approved for the treatment of patients 60 years and older in first relapse with CD33 acute myelogenous leukemia who are not considered candidates for other types of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Adverse events due to the administration of gemtuzumab-ozogamicin include severe myelosuppression, especially neutropenia, requiring careful hematologic monitoring. Other adverse events associated with gemtuzumab are significant hepatotoxicity and various hypersensitivity reactions.

Rituximab is a chimeric murine-human monoclonal $\operatorname{IgG}_{1}$ (human Fc ) that binds to the CD 20 molecule on normal and malignant B lymphocytes and is approved for the therapy of patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade or follicular, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The mechanism of action includes complementmediated lysis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis in the malignant lymphoma cells. This drug appears to be synergistic with chemotherapy (eg, fludarabine, CHOP) for lymphoma (see Chapter 55).

Trastuzumab is a recombinant DNA-derived, humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor HER-2/neu. This antibody blocks the natural ligand from binding and down-regulates the receptor. Trastuzumab is approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients whose tumors overexpress HER-2/neu. As a single agent it induces remission in about 15-20\% of patients; in combination with chemotherapy, it increases response rate and
duration as well as 1-year survival. Trastuzumab is under investigation for other tumors that express HER-2 (see Chapter 55).

\section*{MABs Used to Deliver I sotopes to Tumors}

Arcitumomab is a murine $F\left(a b^{\prime}\right)_{2}$ fragment from an anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) antibody labeled with technetium 99 m ( 99 m Tc ) that is used for imaging patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (immunoscintigraphy) to determine extent of disease. CEA is often upregulated on tumor in patients with gastrointestinal carcinomas. The use of the $F\left(a b^{\prime}\right)_{2}$ fragment decreases the immunogenicity of the agent so that it can be given more than once, unlike other intact murine monoclonal antibodies.

Capromab pendetide is a murine monoclonal antibody specific for prostate specific membrane antigen. It is coupled to isotopic indium ( ${ }^{111} \mathrm{In}$ ) and is used in immunoscintigraphy for patients with biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer and post-prostatectomy in patients with rising prostate specific antibody level to determine extent of disease.

I britumomab tiuxetan is an anti-CD20 murine monoclonal antibody labeled with isotopic yttrium ( 90 Y ) or 111 In . The radiation of the isotope provides the major antitumor activity. Ibritumomab is approved for use in patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, including patients with rituximab-refractory follicular disease. It is used in conjunction with rituximab in a two-step therapeutic regimen.

Nofetumomab is a mouse monoclonal antibody coupled to ${ }^{99 m}$ Tc that is used for diagnostic purposes to determine extent of disease and to stage patients with small cell lung cancer. It binds a 40 kD antigen found on many tumor cell types, but also on some normal cells. It is an accurate indicator of extent of disease in biopsy-confirmed small cell lung cancer except in those patients with brain or adrenal metastases.

Tositumomab is another anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and is complexed with iodine 131 ( ${ }^{131}$ I). Tositumomab is used in two-step therapy in patients with CD20-positive, follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma whose disease is refractory to rituximab and standard chemotherapy. Toxicities are similar to those for ibritumomab and include severe cytopenias such as thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Tositumomab should not be administered to patients with greater than $25 \%$ bone marrow involvement.

\section*{MABs Used as I mmunosuppressants and Anti-I nflammatory Agents}

\section*{ANTI-TNF-ALPHA MABS}

Adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab are antibodies that bind TNF-a., a proinflammatory cytokine. Blocking TNF- from binding to TNF receptors on inflammatory cell surfaces results in suppression of downstream inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6 and adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte activation and migration. An increased risk of lymphoma is common to each of these agents.

Adalimumab is a completely human $\mathrm{IgG}_{1}$ approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis. Like the other anti-TNF-a. biologicals, adalimumab blocks the interaction of TNF-a. with TNF receptors on cell surfaces; it does not bind TNF-B. Pharmacodynamic studies showed that administration of adalimumab reduced levels of Creactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum IL- 6 and matrix metalloproteinases MMP- 1 and MMP-3. In vitro, adalimumab lyses cells expressing TNF-[3] in the presence of complement. Patients may self-administer single doses of the antibody subcutaneously, every other week. Adalimumab has a serum half-life of two weeks which is increased by $29-44 \%$ in patients who are also taking methotrexate.

Etanercept is a dimeric fusion protein composed of human $\operatorname{lgG}_{1}$ constant regions $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{2}, \mathrm{CH}_{3}\right.$, and hinge, but not $\mathrm{CH}_{1}$ ) fused to the TNF receptor. Etanercept binds to both TNF- and TNF- $B$ and appears to have effects similar to that of infliximab, ie, inhibition of TNF-a-mediated inflammation, but its half-life is shorter due to its physical form (fusion protein) and the route of injection (subcutaneously, twice weekly).
Etanercept is approved for adult RA, polyarticular-course juvenile RA, and psoriatic arthritis. It may be used in combination with methotrexate.

Infliximab is a human-mouse chimeric IgG ${ }_{1}$ monoclonal antibody possessing human constant (Fc) regions and murine variable regions. Infliximab is currently approved for use in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis.

\section*{ABATACEPT}

Abatacept is a recombinant fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain of cytotoxic T-lymphocyteassociated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) fused to human IgG Fc. CTLA-4 is a costimulatory molecule found on T cells that binds to CD80 and CD86 on antigen presenting cells (Figure 56-7). This fusion protein blocks activation of T cells by binding to CD80 or 86 so that CD28 on T cells cannot bind and stimulate the T cell and lead to cytokine release. Abatacept is approved for patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis who have failed other DMARDS (see Chapter 36). Patients should not take other anti-TNF drugs or anakinra while taking abatacept.

\section*{ALEFACEPT}

Alefacept is an engineered protein consisting of the CD2-binding portion of leukocyte-function-associated
antigen-3 (LFA-3) fused to a human IgG ${ }_{1}$ Fc region (hinge, $\mathrm{CH}_{1}$, and $\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ ), approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. It inhibits activation of T cells by binding to cell surface CD2, inhibiting the normal CD2/LFA-3 interaction (Figure 56-7). Treatment of patients with alefacept also results in a dose-dependent reduction of the total number of circulating T cells, including those that predominate in psoriatic plaques. Therefore, T -cell counts of patients receiving alefacept must be monitored, and the drug discontinued if CD4 lymphocyte levels fall below 250 cells/H.L.

\section*{BASI LI XI MAB}

Basiliximab is a chimeric mouse-human $\operatorname{IgG}_{1}$ that binds to CD25, the IL-2 receptor alpha chain on activated lymphocytes. It functions as an IL-2 antagonist, blocking IL-2 from binding to activated lymphocytes, and is therefore immunosuppressive. It is indicated for prophylaxis of acute organ rejection in renal transplant patients and is usually used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen that also includes glucocorticoids and cyclosporine A.

\section*{DACLI ZUMAB}

Daclizumab is a humanized $\mathrm{IgG}_{1}$ that binds to the alpha subunit of the IL-2 receptor. Its indications are identical to that of basiliximab, but the mode of administration differs.

\section*{EFALI ZUMAB}

Efalizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-CD11a monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of adult patients with severe psoriasis. Binding of efalizumab to CD11a (the alpha subunit of LFA-1) inhibits the interaction of LFA-1 on all lymphocytes with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), thereby inhibiting the adhesion, activation, and migration of lymphocytes into skin (Figure 56-7). Efalizumab is administered by subcutaneous injection.

\section*{OMALI ZUMAB}

Omalizumab is an anti-IgE recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that is approved for the treatment of allergic asthma in adult and adolescent patients whose symptoms are refractory to inhaled corticosteroids (see Chapter 20). The antibody blocks the binding of IgE to the high-affinity Fce receptor on basophils and mast cells, which suppresses IgE-mediated release of type I allergy mediators such as histamine and leukotrienes. Total serum IgE levels may remain elevated in patients for up to 1 year after administration of this antibody.

\section*{Other MABs}

Abciximab is a Fab fragment of a murine-human monoclonal antibody that binds to the integrin GPIIb/IIIa receptor on activated platelets and inhibits fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and other adhesion molecules from binding to activated platelets, thus preventing their aggregation. See Chapter 34 for additional details.

Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus, preventing infection in susceptible cells in the airways. It is used in neonates at risk for this viral infection and reduces the frequency of infection and hospitalization by about $50 \%$ (see Chapter 49).

\section*{CLI NI CAL USES OF I MMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DRUGS}

Immunosuppressive agents are commonly used in two clinical circumstances: transplantation and autoimmune disorders. The agents used differ somewhat for the specific disorders treated (see specific agents and Table 56-1), as do administration schedules. Because autoimmune disorders are very complex,
optimal treatment schedules have yet to be established in many clinical situations.

\section*{SOLID ORGAN AND BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION}

In organ transplantation, tissue typing-based on donor and recipient histocompatibility matching with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype system-is required. Close histocompatibility matching reduces the likelihood of graft rejection and may also reduce the requirements for intensive immunosuppressive therapy. Prior to transplant, patients may receive an immunosuppressive regimen, including antithymocyte globulin, muromonab-CD3, daclizumab, or basiliximab. Four types of rejection can occur in a solid organ transplant recipient: hyperacute, accelerated, acute, and chronic. Hyperacute rejection is due to preformed antibodies against the donor organ, such as anti-blood group antibodies. Hyperacute rejection occurs within hours of the transplant and cannot be stopped with immunosuppressive drugs. It results in rapid necrosis and failure of the transplanted organ. Accelerated rejection is mediated by both antibodies and T cells, but it also cannot be stopped by immunosuppressive drugs. Acute rejection of an organ occurs within days to months and involves mainly cellular immunity. Reversal of acute rejection is usually possible with general immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and sirolimus. Recently, biologic agents such as anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody have been used to stem acute rejection. Chronic rejection usually occurs months or even years after transplantation. It is characterized by thickening and fibrosis of the vasculature of the transplanted organ, involving both cellular and humoral immunity. Chronic rejection is treated with the same drugs as those used for acute rejection.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a well established treatment for many malignant and nonmalignant diseases. An HLA-matched donor, usually a family member, is located, patients are conditioned with high-dose chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and then donor stem cells are infused. The conditioning regimen is used not only to kill cancer cells in the case of malignant disease, but also to totally suppress the immune system so that the patient does not reject the donor stem cells. As patients' blood counts recover (after reduction by the conditioning regimen) they develop a new immune system that is created from the donor stem cells. Rejection of donor stem cells is uncommon, and can only be treated by infusion of more stem cells from the donor.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), however, is very common, occurring in the majority of patients who receive an allogeneic transplant. Graft-versus-host disease occurs as donor T cells fail to recognize the patient's skin, liver, and gut (usually) as self and attack those tissues. Although patients are given immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine, methotrexate, and others) early in the transplant course to help prevent this development, it usually occurs despite these medications. Acute graft-versus-host disease occurs within the first 100 days, and is usually manifested as a skin rash, severe diarrhea, or hepatotoxicity. Additional medications are added, invariably starting with high-dose corticosteroids, and adding drugs such as mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus, tacrolimus, daclizumab, and others, with variable success rates. Patients generally progress to chronic graft-versus-host disease (after 100 days) and require therapy for variable periods thereafter. Unlike solid organ transplantation, however, stem cell transplant patients generally are able to discontinue immunosuppressive drugs as graft-versus-host disease resolves (generally 1-2 years after their transplant).

\section*{AUTOI MMUNE DISORDERS}

The effectiveness of immunosuppressive drugs in autoimmune disorders varies widely. Nonetheless, with
immunosuppressive therapy, remissions can be obtained in many instances of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and temporal arteritis. Improvement is also often seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, acute glomerulonephritis, acquired factor VIII inhibitors (antibodies), rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory myopathy, scleroderma, and certain other autoimmune states.

Immunosuppressive therapy is utilized in chronic severe asthma, where cyclosporine is often effective and sirolimus is another alternative. Omalizumab (anti-IgE antibody) has recently been approved for the treatment of severe asthma (see previous section). Tacrolimus is currently under clinical investigation for the management of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and of multiple sclerosis, where IFN-B has a definitive role.

\section*{I MMUNOMODULATI ON THERAPY}

The development of agents that modulate the immune response rather than suppress it has become an important area of pharmacology. The rationale underlying this approach is that such drugs may increase the immune responsiveness of patients who have either selective or generalized immunodeficiency. The major potential uses are in immunodeficiency disorders, chronic infectious diseases, and cancer. The AIDS epidemic has greatly increased interest in developing more effective immunomodulating drugs.

\section*{Cytokines}

The cytokines are a large and heterogeneous group of proteins with diverse functions. Some are immunoregulatory proteins synthesized within lymphoreticular cells and play numerous interacting roles in the function of the immune system and in the control of hematopoiesis. The cytokines that have been clearly identified are summarized in Table 56-2. In most instances, cytokines mediate their effects through receptors on relevant target cells and appear to act in a manner similar to the mechanism of action of hormones. In other instances, cytokines may have antiproliferative, antimicrobial, and antitumor effects.

The first group of cytokines discovered, the interferons (IFNs), were followed by the colony-stimulating factors (CSFs, discussed in Chapter 33). The latter regulate the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow progenitor cells. Most of the more recently discovered cytokines have been classified as interleukins (ILs) and numbered in the order of their discovery. Cytokines are produced using gene cloning techniques.

Most cytokines (including TNF-a., IFN- $\gamma$, IL-2, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) have very short serum half-lives (minutes). The usual subcutaneous route of administration provides slower release into the circulation and a longer duration of action. Each cytokine has its own unique toxicity, but some toxicities are shared. For example, IFN-I, IFN-B, IFN- $\gamma$, IL-2, and TNF-[all induce fever, flu-like symptoms, anorexia, fatigue, and malaise.

Interferons are proteins that are currently grouped into three families: IFN- $\alpha$, IFN- $\beta$, and IFN- $\gamma$. The IFN-I. and IFN- $B$ families comprise type I IFNs, ie, acid-stable proteins that act on the same receptor on target cells. IFN- $\uparrow$ ', a type II IFN, is acid-labile and acts on a separate receptor on target cells. Type I IFNs are usually induced by virus infections, with leukocytes producing IFN-2. Fibroblasts and epithelial cells produce IFN-B. IFN- $\gamma$ is usually the product of activated T lymphocytes.

IFNs interact with cell receptors to produce a wide variety of effects that depend on the cell and IFN types. IFNs, particularly IFN- $\gamma$, display immune-enhancing properties, which include increased antigen presentation and macrophage, NK cell, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activation. IFNs also inhibit cell proliferation. In this respect, IFN-区 and IFN-B are more potent than IFN- $\gamma$. Another striking IFN action is increased expression of MHC molecules on cell surfaces. While all three types of IFN induce MHC class I molecules, only IFN- $\gamma$ induces class II expression. In glial cells, IFN-B antagonizes this effect and may, in fact, decrease antigen presentation within the nervous system.

IFN-Q is approved for the treatment of several neoplasms, including hairy cell leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, malignant melanoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma, and for use in hepatitis B and C infections. It has also shown activity as an anticancer agent in renal cell carcinoma, carcinoid syndrome, and T cell leukemia. IFN- B is approved for use in relapsing-type multiple sclerosis. IFN- $\gamma$ is approved for the treatment of chronic granulomatous disease and IL-2, for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. Numerous clinical investigations of the other cytokines, including IL-1, -3, -4, -6, -11, and -12, are still in progress. Toxicities of IFNs, which include fever, chills, malaise, myalgias, myelosuppression, headache, and depression, can severely restrict their clinical use.

TNF- a. has been extensively tested in the therapy of various malignancies, but results have been disappointing due to dose-limiting toxicities. One exception is the use of intra-arterial high-dose TNF-a. for malignant melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities. In these settings, response rates greater than $80 \%$ have been noted.

Cytokines have been under clinical investigation as adjuvants to vaccines, and IFNs and IL-2 have shown some positive effects in the response of human subjects to hepatitis B vaccine. IL-12 and GM-CSF have also shown adjuvant effects with vaccines. GM-CSF is of particular interest because it promotes recruitment of professional antigen-presenting cells such as the dendritic cells required for priming naive antigenspecific T-lymphocyte responses. There are some claims that GM-CSF can itself stimulate an antitumor immune response, resulting in tumor regression in melanoma and prostate cancer.

It is important to emphasize that cytokine interactions with target cells often result in the release of a cascade of different endogenous cytokines, which exert their effects sequentially or simultaneously. For example, IFN- $\gamma^{\prime}$ exposure increases the number of cell surface receptors on target cells for TNF-[2. Therapy with IL- 2 induces the production of TNF-[2, while therapy with IL- 12 induces the production of IFN- $\uparrow$.

\section*{Cytokine I nhibitors}

A more recent application of immunomodulation therapy involves the use of cytokine inhibitors for inflammatory diseases and septic shock, conditions in which cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-a are involved in the pathogenesis. Drugs now under investigation include anticytokine monoclonal antibodies, soluble cytokine receptors (soluble forms of IL-1 and TNF-2. receptors occur naturally in humans), and the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Rx.), anakinra. Anakinra is a recombinant form of the naturally occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist that prevents IL-1 from binding to its receptor, stemming the cascade of cytokines released if IL-1 were to bind to the IL-1R. Anakinra is approved for use in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients who have failed treatment with one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Patients must be carefully monitored if they are also taking an anti-TNF-a. drug, have chronic infections, or are otherwise immunosuppressed.

\section*{I MMUNOLOGI C REACTI ONS TO DRUGS \& DRUG ALLERGY}

The basic immune mechanism and the ways in which it can be suppressed or stimulated by drugs have been discussed in previous sections of this chapter. Drugs also activate the immune system in undesirable ways that are manifested as adverse drug reactions. These reactions are generally grouped in a broad classification as "drug allergy." Indeed, many drug reactions such as those to penicillin, iodides, phenytoin, and sulfonamides are allergic in nature. These drug reactions are manifested as skin eruptions, edema, anaphylactoid reactions, glomerulonephritis, fever, and eosinophilia.

Drug reactions mediated by immune responses can have several different mechanisms. Thus, any of the four major types of hypersensitivity discussed earlier in this chapter (see Hypersensitivity) can be associated with allergic drug reactions:
$\square$ Type I: IgE-mediated acute allergic reactions to stings, pollens, and drugs, including anaphylaxis, urticaria, and angioedema. IgE is fixed to tissue mast cells and blood basophils, and after interaction with antigen the cells release potent mediators.
$\square$ Type II: Drugs often modify host proteins, thereby eliciting antibody responses to the modified protein. These allergic responses involve IgG or IgM in which the antibody becomes fixed to a
host cell, which is then subject to complement-dependent lysis or to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.
$\square$ Type III: Drugs may cause serum sickness, which involves immune complexes containing IgG and is a multisystem complement-dependent vasculitis that may also result in urticaria.
$\square$ Type IV: Cell-mediated allergy is the mechanism involved in allergic contact dermatitis from topically applied drugs or induration of the skin at the site of an antigen injected intradermally.

In some drug reactions, several of these hypersensitivity responses may present simultaneously. Some adverse reactions to drugs may be mistakenly classified as allergic or immune when they are actually genetic deficiency states or are idiosyncratic and not mediated by immune mechanisms (eg, hemolysis due to primaquine in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, or aplastic anemia caused by chloramphenicol).

\section*{I MMEDI ATE (TYPE I) DRUG ALLERGY}

Type I (immediate) sensitivity allergy to certain drugs occurs when the drug, not capable of inducing an immune response by itself, covalently links to a host carrier protein (hapten). When this happens, the immune system detects the drug-hapten conjugate as "modified self" and responds by generating IgE antibodies specific for the drug-hapten. It is not known why some people mount an IgE response to a drug, while others mount IgG responses. Under the influence of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 secreted by T н 2 cells, B cells specific for the drug secrete IgE antibody. The mechanism for IgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity is diagrammed in Figure 56-5.

Fixation of the IgE antibody to high-affinity Fc receptors (FcsRs) on blood basophils or their tissue equivalent (mast cells) sets the stage for an acute allergic reaction. The most important sites for mast cell distribution are skin, nasal epithelium, lung, and gastrointestinal tract. When the offending drug is reintroduced into the body, it binds and cross-links basophil and mast cell-surface IgE to signal release of the mediators (eg, histamine, leukotrienes; see Chapters 16 and 18) from granules. Mediator release is associated with calcium influx and a fall in intracellular cAMP within the mast cell. Many of the drugs that block mediator release appear to act through the cAMP mechanism (eg, catecholamines, glucocorticoids, theophylline), others block histamine release, and still others block histamine receptors. Other vasoactive substances such as kinins may also be generated during histamine release. These mediators initiate immediate vascular smooth muscle relaxation, increased vascular permeability, hypotension, edema, and bronchoconstriction.

\section*{Drug Treatment of I mmediate Allergy}

One can test an individual for possible sensitivity to a drug by a simple scratch test, ie, by applying an extremely dilute solution of the drug to the skin and making a scratch with the tip of a needle. If allergy is present, an immediate (within 10-15 minutes) wheal (edema) and flare (increased blood flow) will occur. However, skin tests may be negative in spite of IgE hypersensitivity to a hapten or to a metabolic product of the drug, especially if the patient is taking steroids or antihistamines.

Drugs that modify allergic responses act at several links in this chain of events. Prednisone, often used in severe allergic reactions, is immunosuppressive; it blocks proliferation of the IgE-producing clones and inhibits IL-4 production by T helper cells in the IgE response, since glucocorticoids are generally toxic to lymphocytes. In the efferent limb of the allergic response, isoproterenol, epinephrine, and theophylline
reduce the release of mediators from mast cells and basophils and produce bronchodilation. Epinephrine opposes histamine; it relaxes bronchiolar smooth muscle and contracts vascular muscle, relieving both bronchospasm and hypotension. The antihistamines competitively inhibit histamine, which would otherwise produce bronchoconstriction and increased capillary permeability in the end organ. Glucocorticoids may also act to reduce tissue injury and edema in the inflamed tissue, as well as facilitating the actions of catecholamines in cells that may have become refractory to epinephrine or isoproterenol. Several agents directed toward the inhibition of leukotriene synthesis may be useful in acute allergic and inflammatory disorders (see Chapter 20).

\section*{Desensitization to Drugs}

When reasonable alternatives are not available, certain drugs (eg, penicillin, insulin) must be used for lifethreatening illnesses even in the presence of known allergic sensitivity. In such cases, desensitization can sometimes be accomplished by starting with very small doses of the drug and gradually increasing the dose over a period of hours to the full therapeutic range (see Chapter 43). This practice is hazardous and must be performed under direct medical supervision, as anaphylaxis may occur before desensitization has been achieved. It is thought that slow and progressive administration of the drug gradually binds all available IgE on mast cells, triggering a gradual release of granules. Once all of the IgE on the mast cell surfaces has been bound and the cells have been degranulated, therapeutic doses of the offending drug may be given with minimal further immune reaction. Therefore, a patient is only desensitized during administration of the drug.

\section*{AUTOI MMUNE (TYPE II) REACTIONS TO DRUGS}

Certain autoimmune syndromes can be induced by drugs. Examples include systemic lupus erythematosus following hydralazine or procainamide therapy, "lupoid hepatitis" due to cathartic sensitivity, autoimmune hemolytic anemia resulting from methyldopa administration, thrombocytopenic purpura due to quinidine, and agranulocytosis due to a variety of drugs. As indicated in other chapters of this book, a number of drugs are associated with type I and type II reactions. In these drug-induced autoimmune states, IgG antibodies bind to drug-modified tissue and are destroyed by the complement system or by phagocytic cells with Fc receptors. Fortunately, autoimmune reactions to drugs usually subside within several months after the offending drug is withdrawn. Immunosuppressive therapy is warranted only when the autoimmune response is unusually severe.

\section*{SERUM SICKNESS \& VASCULITIC (TYPE III) REACTIONS}

Immunologic reactions to drugs resulting in serum sickness are more common than immediate anaphylactic responses, but type II and type III hypersensitivities often overlap. The clinical features of serum sickness include urticarial and erythematous skin eruptions, arthralgia or arthritis, lymphadenopathy, glomerulonephritis, peripheral edema, and fever. The reactions generally last 6-12 days and usually subside once the offending drug is eliminated. Antibodies of the IgM or IgG class are usually involved. The mechanism of tissue injury is immune complex formation and deposition on basement membranes (eg, lung, kidney), followed by complement activation and infiltration of leukocytes, causing tissue destruction. Glucocorticoids are useful in attenuating severe serum sickness reactions to drugs. In severe cases plasmapheresis can be used to remove the offending drug and immune complexes from circulation.

Immune vasculitis can also be induced by drugs. The sulfonamides, penicillin, thiouracil, anticonvulsants, and iodides have all been implicated in the initiation of hypersensitivity angiitis. Erythema multiforme is a
relatively mild vasculitic skin disorder that may be secondary to drug hypersensitivity. Stevens-J ohnson syndrome is probably a more severe form of this hypersensitivity reaction and consists of erythema multiforme, arthritis, nephritis, central nervous system abnormalities, and myocarditis. It has frequently been associated with sulfonamide therapy. Administration of nonhuman monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies such as rattlesnake antivenin may cause serum sickness.

\section*{I NTRODUCTION TO TOXI COLOGY: OCCUPATIONAL \& ENVI RONMENTAL: I NTRODUCTION}

Humans live in a chemical environment and inhale, ingest, or absorb from the skin many of these chemicals. Toxicology is concerned with the deleterious effects of these chemical agents on all living systems. In the biomedical area, however, the toxicologist is primarily concerned with adverse effects in humans resulting from exposure to drugs and other chemicals as well as the demonstration of safety or hazard associated with their use.

\section*{Occupational Toxicology}

Occupational toxicology deals with the chemicals found in the workplace. The major emphasis of occupational toxicology is to identify the agents of concern, define the conditions leading to their safe use, and prevent absorption of harmful amounts. Guidelines have been elaborated to establish safe ambient air concentrations for many chemicals found in the workplace. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists periodically prepares lists of recommended threshold limit values (TLVs) for about 600 such chemicals. These guidelines are reevaluated as new information becomes available.

\section*{Environmental Toxicology}

Environmental toxicology deals with the potentially deleterious impact of chemicals, present as pollutants of the environment, on living organisms. The term environment includes all the surroundings of an individual organism, but particularly the air, soil, and water. While humans are considered a target species of particular interest, other species are of considerable importance as potential biologic targets.

Air pollution is a product of industrialization, technologic development, and increased urbanization. Humans may also be exposed to chemicals used in the agricultural environment as pesticides or in food processing that may persist as residues or ingredients in food products. The Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) Joint Expert Commission on Food Additives adopted the term acceptable daily intake (ADI) to denote the daily intake of a chemical which, during an entire lifetime, appears to be without appreciable risk. These guidelines are reevaluated as new information becomes available.

\section*{Ecotoxicology}

Ecotoxicology is concerned with the toxic effects of chemical and physical agents on populations and communities of living organisms within defined ecosystems; it includes the transfer pathways of those agents and their interactions with the environment. Traditional toxicology is concerned with toxic effects on individual organisms; ecotoxicology is concerned with the impact on populations of living organisms or on ecosystems. It is possible that an environmental event, while exerting severe effects on individual organisms, may have no important impact on populations or on an ecosystem. Thus, the terms "environmental toxicology" and "ecotoxicology" are not interchangeable.

\section*{TOXI COLOGI C TERMS \& DEFI NI TI ONS}

\section*{Hazard \& Risk}

Hazard is the ability of a chemical agent to cause injury in a given situation or setting; the conditions of use and exposure are primary considerations. To assess hazard, one needs to have knowledge about both the inherent toxicity of the substance and the amounts to which individuals are liable to be exposed. Humans can safely use potentially toxic substances when the necessary conditions minimizing absorption are established and respected.

Risk is defined as the expected frequency of the occurrence of an undesirable effect arising from exposure to a chemical or physical agent. Estimation of risk makes use of dose-response data and extrapolation from the observed relationships to the expected responses at doses occurring in actual exposure situations. The quality and suitability of the biologic data used in such estimates are major limiting factors.

\section*{Routes of Exposure}

The route of entry for chemicals into the body differs in different exposure situations. In the industrial setting, inhalation is the major route of entry. The transdermal route is also quite important, but oral ingestion is a relatively minor route. Consequently, preventive measures are largely designed to eliminate absorption by inhalation or by topical contact. Atmospheric pollutants gain entry by inhalation, whereas for pollutants of water and soil, oral ingestion is the principal route of exposure for humans.

\section*{Duration of Exposure}

Toxic reactions may differ qualitatively depending on the duration of the exposure. A single exposure-or multiple exposures occurring over 1 or 2 days-represents acute exposure. Multiple exposures continuing over a longer period of time represent a chronic exposure. In the occupational setting, both acute (eg, accidental discharge) and chronic (eg, repetitive handling of a chemical) exposures may occur, whereas with chemicals found in the environment (eg, pollutants in ground water), chronic exposure is more likely.

\section*{ENVI RONMENTAL CONSI DERATI ONS}

Certain chemical and physical characteristics are known to be important for estimating the potential hazard involved for environmental toxicants. In addition to information regarding effects on different organisms, knowledge about the following properties is essential to predict the environmental impact: The degradability of the substance; its mobility through air, water, and soil; whether or not bioaccumulation occurs; and its transport and biomagnification through food chains. (See Bioaccumulation \& Biomagnification.) Chemicals that are poorly degraded (by abiotic or biotic pathways) exhibit environmental persistence and thus can accumulate. Lipophilic substances tend to bioaccumulate in body fat, resulting in tissue residues. When the toxicant is incorporated into the food chain, biomagnification occurs as one species feeds upon others and concentrates the chemical. The pollutants that have the widest environmental impact are poorly degradable; are relatively mobile in air, water, and soil; exhibit bioaccumulation; and also exhibit biomagnification.

\section*{Bioaccumulation \& Biomagnification}

If the intake of a long-lasting contaminant by an organism exceeds the latter's ability to metabolize or excrete the substance, the chemical accumulates within the tissues of the organism. This is called bioaccumulation.

Although the concentration of a contaminant may be virtually undetectable in water, it may be magnified hundreds or thousands of time as the contaminant passes up the food chain. This is called biomagnification.

The biomagnification of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the Great Lakes of North America is illustrated by the following residue values available from Environment Canada, a report published by the Canadian government, and other sources.

Thus, the biomagnification for this substance in the food chain, beginning with phytoplankton and ending with the herring gull, is nearly 50,000-fold. Domesticated animals and humans may eat fish from the Great Lakes, resulting in PCB residues in these species as well.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Source & PCB Concentration (ppm) ${ }^{1}$ & Concentration Relative to Phytoplankton \\
\hline Phytoplankton & 0.0025 & 1 \\
\hline Zooplankton & 0.123 & 49.2 \\
\hline Rainbow smelt & 1.04 & 416 \\

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{AI R POLLUTANTS}

Five major substances account for about 98\% of air pollution: carbon monoxide (about 52\%), sulfur oxides (about 14\%), hydrocarbons (about 14\%), nitrogen oxides (about 14\%), and particulate matter (about 4\%). The sources of these chemicals include transportation, industry, generation of electric power, space heating, and refuse disposal. Sulfur dioxide and smoke resulting from incomplete combustion of coal have been associated with acute adverse effects, particularly among the elderly and individuals with preexisting cardiac or respiratory disease. Ambient air pollution has been implicated as a contributing factor in bronchitis, obstructive ventilatory disease, pulmonary emphysema, bronchial asthma, and lung cancer.

\section*{Carbon Monoxide}

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, tasteless, odorless, and nonirritating gas, a byproduct of incomplete combustion. The average concentration of CO in the atmosphere is about 0.1 ppm; in heavy traffic, the concentration may exceed 100 ppm. The recommended 2005 threshold limit values (TLV-TWA and TLV-STEL) are shown in Table 57-1.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}

${ }^{1}$ TLV-TWA is the concentration for a normal 8 -hour workday or 40 -hour workweek to which workers may be repeatedly exposed without adverse effects.
${ }^{2}$ TLV-STEL is the maximum concentration that should not be exceeded at any time during a 15-minute exposure period.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

CO combines reversibly with the oxygen-binding sites of hemoglobin and has an affinity for hemoglobin that is about 220 times that of oxygen. The product formed, carboxyhemoglobin, cannot transport oxygen. Furthermore, the presence of carboxyhemoglobin interferes with the dissociation of oxygen from the remaining oxyhemoglobin, thus reducing the transfer of oxygen to tissues. The brain and the heart are the organs most affected. Normal nonsmoking adults have carboxyhemoglobin levels of less than $1 \%$ saturation ( $1 \%$ of total hemoglobin is in the form of carboxyhemoglobin); this level has been
attributed to the endogenous formation of CO from heme catabolism. Smokers may exhibit 5-10\% saturation, depending on their smoking habits. An individual breathing air containing $0.1 \%$ CO (1000 ppm) would have a carboxyhemoglobin level of about 50\%.

\section*{Clinical Effects}

The principal signs of CO intoxication are those of hypoxia and progress in the following sequence: (1) psychomotor impairment; (2) headache and tightness in the temporal area; (3) confusion and loss of visual acuity; (4) tachycardia, tachypnea, syncope, and coma; and (5) deep coma, convulsions, shock, and respiratory failure. There is great variability in individual responses to a given carboxyhemoglobin concentration. Carboxyhemoglobin levels below 15\% rarely produce symptoms; collapse and syncope may appear around $40 \%$; above $60 \%$, death may ensue. Prolonged hypoxia and posthypoxic unconsciousness can result in irreversible damage to the brain and the myocardium. The clinical effects may be aggravated by heavy labor, high altitudes, and high ambient temperatures. The presence of cardiovascular disease is considered to increase the risks associated with CO exposure. Delayed neuropsychiatric impairment can occur after poisoning, and the resolution of behavioral consequences can be slow. While CO intoxication is usually thought of as a form of acute toxicity, there is some evidence that chronic exposure to low levels may lead to undesirable effects, including the development of atherosclerotic coronary disease in cigarette smokers. However, convincing experimental evidence is lacking. The fetus may be quite susceptible to the effects of CO exposure.

\section*{Treatment}

In cases of acute intoxication, removal of the individual from the exposure source and maintenance of respiration is essential, followed by administration of oxygen-the specific antagonist to CO-within the limits of oxygen toxicity. With room air at 1 atm, the elimination half-time of CO is about 320 minutes; with $100 \%$ oxygen, the half-time is about 80 minutes; and with hyperbaric oxygen ( $2-3 \mathrm{~atm}$ ), the halftime can be reduced to about 20 minutes. Questions still exist about the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of CO poisoning, and absolute indications for its use have yet to be established.

\section*{Sulfur Dioxide}

Sulfur dioxide ( $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ ) is a colorless, irritant gas generated primarily by the combustion of sulfurcontaining fossil fuels. The 2005 threshold limit values are given in Table 57-1.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

On contact with moist membranes, $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ forms sulfurous acid, which is responsible for its severe irritant effects on the eyes, mucous membranes, and skin. It is estimated that approximately $90 \%$ of inhaled $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ is absorbed in the upper respiratory tract, the site of its principal effect. The inhalation of $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ causes bronchial constriction; parasympathetic reflexes and altered smooth muscle tone appear to be involved in this reaction. Exposure to 5 ppm for 10 minutes leads to increased resistance to airflow in most humans. Exposures to $5-10 \mathrm{ppm}$ are reported to cause severe bronchospasm; $10-20 \%$ of the healthy young adult population is estimated to be reactive to even lower concentrations. The phenomenon of adaptation to irritating concentrations is a recognized occurrence in workers. Asthmatic individuals are especially sensitive to $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$.

\section*{Clinical Effects \& Treatment}

The signs and symptoms of intoxication include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat and reflex
bronchoconstriction. If severe exposure has occurred, delayed onset pulmonary edema may be observed. Cumulative effects from chronic low-level exposure to $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ are not striking, particularly in humans. Chronic exposure, however, has been associated with aggravation of chronic cardiopulmonary disease. Treatment is not specific for $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ but depends on therapeutic maneuvers utilized in the treatment of irritation of the respiratory tract.

\section*{Nitrogen Oxides}

Nitrogen dioxide ( $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ ) is a brownish irritant gas sometimes associated with fires. It is formed also from fresh silage; exposure of farmers to $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ in the confines of a silo can lead to silo-filler's disease. The 2005 threshold limit values are shown in Table 57-1.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}
$\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ is a deep lung irritant capable of producing pulmonary edema. The type I cells of the alveoli appear to be the cells chiefly affected on acute exposure. Exposure to 25 ppm is irritating to some individuals; 50 ppm is moderately irritating to the eyes and nose. Exposure for 1 hour to 50 ppm can cause pulmonary edema and perhaps subacute or chronic pulmonary lesions; 100 ppm can cause pulmonary edema and death.

\section*{Clinical Effects \& Treatment}

The signs and symptoms of acute exposure to $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ include irritation of the eyes and nose, cough, mucoid or frothy sputum production, dyspnea, and chest pain. Pulmonary edema may appear within 1-2 hours. In some individuals, the clinical signs may subside in about 2 weeks; the patient may then pass into a second stage of abruptly increasing severity, including recurring pulmonary edema and fibrotic destruction of terminal bronchioles (bronchiolitis obliterans). Chronic exposure of laboratory animals to 10-25 ppm NO2 has resulted in emphysematous changes; thus, chronic effects in humans are of concern. There is no specific treatment for acute intoxication by $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$; therapeutic measures for the management of deep lung irritation and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema are employed. These measures include maintenance of gas exchange with adequate oxygenation and alveolar ventilation. Drug therapy may include bronchodilators, sedatives, and antibiotics.

\section*{Ozone}

Ozone ( $\mathrm{O}_{3}$ ) is a bluish irritant gas that occurs normally in the earth's atmosphere, where it is an important absorbent of ultraviolet light. In the workplace, it can occur around high-voltage electrical equipment and around ozone-producing devices used for air and water purification. It is also an important oxidant found in polluted urban air. The effect of low ambient levels of ozone on admission to Ontario, Canada, hospitals for respiratory problems revealed a near-linear gradient between exposure (1-hour level, 20-100 ppb) and response. See Table 57-1 for 2005 threshold limit values.

\section*{Clinical Effects \& Treatment}
$\mathrm{O}_{3}$ is an irritant of mucous membranes. Mild exposure produces upper respiratory tract irritation. Severe exposure can cause deep lung irritation, with pulmonary edema when inhaled at sufficient concentrations. Ozone penetration in the lung depends on tidal volume; consequently, exercise can increase the amount of ozone reaching the distal lung. Some of the effects of $\mathrm{O}_{3}$ resemble those seen with radiation, suggesting that $\mathrm{O}_{3}$ toxicity may result from the formation of reactive free radicals. The gas causes shallow, rapid breathing and a decrease in pulmonary compliance. Enhanced sensitivity of
the lung to bronchoconstrictors is also observed. Exposure around 0.1 ppm for $10-30$ minutes causes irritation and dryness of the throat; above 0.1 ppm, one finds changes in visual acuity, substernal pain, and dyspnea. Pulmonary function is impaired at concentrations exceeding 0.8 ppm . Airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation have been observed in humans.

Animal studies indicate that the response of the lung to $\mathrm{O}_{3}$ is a dynamic one. The morphologic and biochemical changes are the result of both direct injury and secondary responses to the initial damage. Long-term exposure in animals results in morphologic and functional pulmonary changes. Chronic bronchitis, bronchiolitis, fibrosis, and emphysematous changes have been reported in a variety of species exposed to concentrations above 1 ppm . There is no specific treatment for acute $\mathrm{O}_{3}$ intoxication. Management depends on therapeutic measures utilized for deep lung irritation and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (see Nitrogen Oxides, above).

\section*{SOLVENTS}

\section*{Halogenated Aliphatic Hydrocarbons}

These agents find wide use as industrial solvents, degreasing agents, and cleaning agents. The substances include carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene), and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (methyl chloroform). See Table 57-1 for recommended threshold limit values.

\section*{Mechanism of Action \& Clinical Effects}

In laboratory animals, the halogenated hydrocarbons cause central nervous system depression, liver injury, kidney injury, and some degree of cardiotoxicity. These substances are depressants of the central nervous system in humans, although their relative potencies vary considerably; chloroform is the most potent and was widely used as an anesthetic agent. Chronic exposure to tetrachloroethylene can cause impaired memory and peripheral neuropathy. In 1994, evidence was presented suggesting that 1,1,1-trichloroethane used in some degreasing operations may be associated with peripheral neuropathy. This proposed association requires confirmation because of the widespread use of this agent. Hepatotoxicity is also a common toxic effect that can occur in humans after acute or chronic exposures, the severity of the lesion being dependent on the amount absorbed. Carbon tetrachloride is the most potent of the series in this regard. Nephrotoxicity can occur in humans exposed to carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and trichloroethylene. With chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, and tetrachloroethylene, carcinogenicity has been observed in lifetime exposure studies performed in rats and mice. The potential effects of low-level, long-term exposures in humans are yet to be determined. However, a review of the epidemiologic literature on the occupational exposure of workers to tetrachloroethylene found no association between breast, prostate, skin, or brain cancer and exposure to the agent, while a relationship for cancer of the oral cavity, liver, pancreas, or lung appeared unlikely. Data indicate that the margin of safety for humans is very large with respect to the potential carcinogenic effect of household exposure to chloroform or environmentally relevant concentrations of trichloroethylene.

\section*{Treatment}

There is no specific treatment for acute intoxication resulting from exposure to halogenated hydrocarbons. Management depends on the organ system involved.

\section*{Aromatic Hydrocarbons}

Benzene is widely used for its solvent properties and as an intermediate in the synthesis of other chemicals. The 2005 recommended threshold limit values are given in Table 57-1. The acute toxic effect of benzene is depression of the central nervous system. Exposure to 7500 ppm for 30 minutes can be fatal. Exposure to concentrations larger than 3000 ppm may cause euphoria, nausea, locomotor problems, and coma; vertigo, drowsiness, headache, and nausea may occur at concentrations ranging from 250 to 500 ppm. No specific treatment exists for the acute toxic effect of benzene.

Chronic exposure to benzene can result in very serious toxic effects, the most significant being an insidious and unpredictable injury to the bone marrow; aplastic anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, or thrombocytopenia may occur. Bone marrow cells in early stages of development appear to be most sensitive to benzene. The early symptoms of chronic benzene intoxication may be rather vague (headache, fatigue, and loss of appetite). Epidemiologic data suggest an association between chronic benzene exposure and an increased incidence of leukemia in workers.

Toluene (methylbenzene) does not possess the myelotoxic properties of benzene, nor has it been associated with leukemia. It is, however, a central nervous system depressant. See Table 57-1 for the threshold limit values. Exposure to 800 ppm can lead to severe fatigue and ataxia; 10,000 ppm can produce rapid loss of consciousness. Chronic effects of long-term toluene exposure are unclear because human studies indicating behavioral effects usually concern exposures to several solvents, not toluene alone. In limited occupational studies, however, metabolic interactions and modification of toluene's effects have not been observed in workers also exposed to other solvents.

\section*{I NSECTI CI DES}

\section*{Organochlorine I nsecticides}

These agents are usually classified in four groups: DDT (chlorophenothane) and its analogs, benzene hexachlorides, cyclodienes, and toxaphenes (Table 57-2). They are aryl, carbocyclic, or heterocyclic compounds containing chlorine substituents. The individual compounds differ widely in their biotransformation and capacity for storage in tissues; toxicity and storage are not always correlated. They can be absorbed through the skin as well as by inhalation or oral ingestion. There are, however, important quantitative differences between the various derivatives; DDT in solution is poorly absorbed through the skin, whereas dieldrin absorption from the skin is very efficient.

${ }^{2} \mathrm{ADI}=$ acceptable daily intake ( $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ).

\section*{Human Toxicology}

The acute toxic properties of the organochlorine insecticides in humans are qualitatively similar. These agents interfere with inactivation of the sodium channel in excitable membranes and cause rapid repetitive firing in most neurons. Calcium ion transport is inhibited. These events affect repolarization and enhance the excitability of neurons. The major effect is central nervous system stimulation. With DDT, tremor may be the first manifestation, possibly continuing on to convulsions, whereas with the other compounds convulsions often appear as the first sign of intoxication. There is no specific treatment for the acute intoxicated state, management being symptomatic.

Chronic administration of some of these agents to laboratory animals over long periods has resulted in enhanced tumorigenicity; there is no agreement regarding the potential carcinogenic properties of these substances, and extrapolation of these observations to humans is controversial. Evidence of carcinogenic effects in humans has not been established. In a large epidemiologic study, no relationship was observed between the risk of breast cancer and serum levels of DDE, the major metabolite of DDT. Similarly, the results of a case-control study conducted to investigate the relation
between DDE and DDT breast adipose tissue levels and breast cancer risk did not support a positive association.

\section*{Environmental Toxicology}

The organochlorine insecticides are considered persistent chemicals. Degradation is quite slow when compared with other insecticides, and bioaccumulation, particularly in aquatic ecosystems, is well documented. Their mobility in soil depends on the composition of the soil; the presence of organic matter favors the adsorption of these chemicals onto the soil particles, whereas adsorption is poor in sandy soils. Once adsorbed, they do not readily desorb.

Because of their environmental impact, use of the organochlorine insecticides has been largely curtailed in North America and Europe. Some of them are still used, however, in equatorial countries.

\section*{Organophosphorus Insecticides}

These agents, some of which are listed in Table 57-3, are utilized to combat a large variety of pests. They are useful pesticides when in direct contact with insects or when used as plant systemics, where the agent is translocated within the plant and exerts its effects on insects that feed on the plant. Some of these agents are used in human and veterinary medicine as local or systemic antiparasitics (see Chapters 7 and 54). The compounds are absorbed by the skin as well as by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Biotransformation is rapid, particularly when compared with the rates observed with the chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides. Current and suggested human inhalation occupational exposure limits for 30 organophosphate pesticides were reviewed by Storm and collaborators in 2000.

\section*{Human Toxicology}

In mammals as well as insects, the major effect of these agents is inhibition of acetylcholinesterase through phosphorylation of the esteratic site. The signs and symptoms that characterize acute intoxication are due to inhibition of this enzyme and accumulation of acetylcholine; some of the agents also possess direct cholinergic activity. These effects and their treatment are described in Chapters 7 and 8 of this book. Altered neurologic and cognitive function, as well as psychological symptoms of variable duration, have been associated with exposure to high concentrations of these insecticides. Furthermore, there is some indication of an association of low arylesterase activity with neurologic symptom complexes in Gulf War veterans.

In addition to-and independently of-inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, some of these agents are capable of phosphorylating another enzyme present in neural tissue, the so-called neuropathy target esterase. This results in development of a delayed neurotoxicity characterized by polyneuropathy, associated with paralysis and axonal degeneration (organophosphorus ester-induced delayed polyneuropathy; OPIDP); hens are particularly sensitive to these properties and have proved very useful for studying the pathogenesis of the lesion and for identifying potentially neurotoxic organophosphorus derivatives. In humans, neurotoxicity has been observed with triorthocresyl phosphate (TOCP), a noninsecticidal organophosphorus compound, and is thought to occur with the insecticides dichlorvos, trichlorfon, leptophos, methamidophos, mipafox, and trichloronat. The polyneuropathy usually begins with burning and tingling sensations, particularly in the feet, with motor weakness following a few days later. Sensory and motor difficulties may extend to the legs and hands. Gait is affected, and ataxia may be present. There is no specific treatment for this form of delayed neurotoxicity.

\section*{Environmental Toxicology}

Organophosphorus insecticides are not considered to be persistent pesticides because they are relatively unstable and break down in the environment. As a class they are considered to have a small impact on the environment in spite of their acute effects on organisms.

\section*{Carbamate Insecticides}

These compounds (Table 57-4) inhibit acetylcholinesterase by carbamoylation of the esteratic site. Thus, they possess the toxic properties associated with inhibition of this enzyme as described for the organophosphorus insecticides. The effects and treatment are described in Chapters 7 and 8. The clinical effects due to carbamates are of shorter duration than those observed with organophosphorus compounds. The range between the doses that cause minor intoxication and those that result in
lethality is larger with carbamates than with the organophosphorus agents. Spontaneous reactivation of cholinesterase is more rapid after inhibition by the carbamates. While the clinical approach to carbamate poisoning is similar to that for organophosphates, the use of pralidoxime is not recommended.

The carbamate insecticides are considered to be nonpersistent pesticides and are thought to exert only a small impact on the environment.

\section*{Botanical Insecticides}

Insecticides derived from natural sources include nicotine, rotenone, and pyrethrum. Nicotine is obtained from the dried leaves of Nicotiana tabacum and N rustica. It is rapidly absorbed from mucosal surfaces; the free alkaloid, but not the salt, is readily absorbed from the skin. Nicotine reacts with the acetylcholine receptor of the postsynaptic membrane (sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia, neuromuscular junction), resulting in depolarization of the membrane. Toxic doses cause stimulation
rapidly followed by blockade of transmission. These actions are described in Chapter 7. Treatment is directed toward maintenance of vital signs and suppression of convulsions.

Rotenone (Figure 57-1) is obtained from Derris elliptica, D mallaccensis, Lonchocarpus utilis, and L urucu. The oral ingestion of rotenone produces gastrointestinal irritation. Conjunctivitis, dermatitis, pharyngitis, and rhinitis can also occur. Treatment is symptomatic.

Pyrethrin I
Copyright ©2006 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.

Chemical structures of selected herbicides and pesticides.
Pyrethrum consists of six known insecticidal esters: pyrethrin I (Figure 57-1), pyrethrin II, cinerin I, cinerin II, jasmolin I, and jasmolin II. Synthetic pyrethroids account for about $30 \%$ of worldwide insecticide usage. Pyrethrum may be absorbed after inhalation or ingestion; absorption from the skin is not significant. The esters are extensively biotransformed. Pyrethrum insecticides are not highly toxic to mammals. When absorbed in sufficient quantities, the major site of toxic action is the central nervous system; excitation, convulsions, and tetanic paralysis can occur. Voltage-gated sodium, calcium, and chloride channels are considered targets, as well as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors. Symptomatic treatment is usually employed. Anticonvulsants are not consistently effective. The chloride channel agonist, ivermectin, is of use as are pentobarbital and mephenesin. The most frequent injury reported in humans results from the allergenic properties of the substance, especially contact dermatitis. Cutaneous paresthesias have been observed in workers spraying synthetic pyrethroids. Severe occupational exposures to synthetic pyrethroids in China resulted in marked effects on the central nervous system, including convulsions.

\section*{HERBICIDES}

\section*{Chlorophenoxy Herbicides}

2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), and their salts and esters are the major compounds of interest as herbicides used for the destruction of weeds (Figure 57-1). They have been assigned toxicity ratings of 4 or 3, respectively, which place the probable human lethal dosages at $50-500$ or $500-5000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, respectively.

In humans, 2,4-D in large doses can cause coma and generalized muscle hypotonia. Rarely, muscle weakness and marked hypotonia may persist for several weeks. With 2,4,5-T, coma may occur, but the muscular dysfunction is less evident. In laboratory animals, signs of liver and kidney dysfunction have also been reported. There is limited evidence that occupational exposure to phenoxy herbicides is associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; the evidence for soft-tissue sarcoma, however, is considered equivocal.

The toxicologic profile for these agents, particularly that of 2,4,5-T, has been confusing because of the presence of chemical contaminants (dioxins) produced during the manufacturing process (see below). $2,3,7,8$-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is the most important of these contaminants.

\section*{Bipyridyl Herbicides}

Paraquat is the most important agent of this class (Figure 57-1). Its mechanism of action is said to be similar in plants and animals and involves single-electron reduction of the herbicide to free radical species. It has been given a toxicity rating of 4 , which places the probable human lethal dosage at $50-500 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$. Several lethal human intoxications (accidental or suicidal) have been reported.
Paraquat accumulates slowly in the lung by an active process and causes lung edema, alveolitis, and progressive fibrosis.

In humans, the first signs and symptoms after oral exposure are attributable to gastrointestinal irritation (hematemesis and bloody stools). Within a few days, however, delayed toxicity occurs, with respiratory distress and the development of congestive hemorrhagic pulmonary edema accompanied
by widespread cellular proliferation. Hepatic, renal, or myocardial involvement may also be evident. The interval between ingestion and death may be several weeks. Because of the delayed pulmonary toxicity, prompt removal of paraquat from the digestive tract is important. Gastric lavage, the use of cathartics, and the use of adsorbents to prevent further absorption have all been advocated; after absorption, treatment is successful in fewer than $50 \%$ of cases. Oxygen should be used cautiously to combat dyspnea or cyanosis, as it may aggravate the pulmonary lesions. Patients require prolonged observation, because the proliferative phase begins 1-2 weeks after ingestion.

\section*{ENVI RONMENTAL POLLUTANTS}

\section*{Polychlorinated Biphenyls}

The polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, coplanar biphenyls) have been used in a large variety of applications as dielectric and heat transfer fluids, plasticizers, wax extenders, and flame retardants. Their industrial use and manufacture in the USA was terminated by 1977. Unfortunately, they persist in the environment. The products used commercially were actually mixtures of PCB isomers and homologs containing 12-68\% chlorine. These chemicals are highly stable and highly lipophilic, poorly metabolized, and very resistant to environmental degradation; they bioaccumulate in food chains. Food is the major source of PCB residues in humans.

A serious exposure to PCBs—lasting several months—occurred in Japan in 1968 as a result of cooking oil contamination with PCB-containing transfer medium (Yusho disease). Possible effects on the fetus and on the development of the offspring of poisoned women were reported. It is now known that the contaminated cooking oil contained not only PCBs but also polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and polychlorinated quaterphenyls (PCQs). Consequently, the effects that were initially attributed to the presence of PCBs are now thought to have been largely caused by the other contaminants. Workers occupationally exposed to PCBs have exhibited the following clinical signs: dermatologic problems (chloracne, folliculitis, erythema, dryness, rash, hyperkeratosis, hyperpigmentation), some hepatic involvement, and elevated plasma triglycerides.

The effects of PCBs alone on reproduction and development, as well as their carcinogenic effects, have yet to be established in humans-whether workers or the general population-even though some subjects have been exposed to very high levels of PCBs. Some adverse behavioral effects in infants are reported to have been observed, but the effects were dissimilar. An association between prenatal exposure to PCBs and deficits in childhood intellectual function was described for children born to mothers who had eaten large quantities of contaminated fish. The bulk of the evidence from human studies indicates that PCBs pose little hazard to human health except in situations where food is contaminated with high concentrations of these congeners.

The polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), or dioxins, have been mentioned above as a group of congeners of which the most important is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). In addition, there is a larger group of dioxin-like compounds, including certain polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and coplanar biphenyls. While PCBs were used commercially, PCDDs and PCDFs are unwanted by-products that appear in the environment as contaminants because of improperly controlled combustion processes. PCDD and PCDF contamination of the global environment is considered to represent a contemporary problem produced by human activities. Like PCBs, these
chemicals are very stable and highly lipophilic. They are poorly metabolized and very resistant to environmental degradation.

In laboratory animals, TCDD administered in suitable doses has produced a wide variety of toxic effects, including a wasting syndrome (severe weight loss accompanied by reduction of muscle mass and adipose tissue), thymic atrophy, epidermal changes, hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity, effects on reproduction and development, teratogenicity, and carcinogenicity. Fortunately, most of these actions have not been observed in humans. The effects observed in workers involved in the manufacture of 2,4,5-T (and therefore presumably exposed to TCDD) consisted primarily of contact dermatitis and chloracne. In severely TCDD-intoxicated patients, only discrete chloracne may be present.

The presence of TCDD in 2,4,5-T is believed to be largely responsible for other human toxicities associated with the herbicide. There is some epidemiologic evidence indicating an association between occupational exposure to the phenoxy herbicides and an excess incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The evidence of an association of increased soft tissue sarcomas with herbicides themselves, however, is considered equivocal. On the other hand, the TCDD contaminant in these herbicides may play a role in soft tissue sarcomas.

\section*{Endocrine Disruptors}

The potential hazardous effects of some chemicals in the environment are receiving considerable attention because of their estrogen-like or antiandrogenic properties. Compounds that affect thyroid function are also of concern. Since 1998, the process of prioritization, screening, and testing of chemicals for such actions has been undergoing worldwide development. These chemicals mimic, enhance, or inhibit a hormonal action. They include a number of plant constituents (phytoestrogens) and some mycoestrogens as well as industrial chemicals, particularly persistent organochlorine agents such as DDT and PCBs. Some brominated flame retardants are now being investigated as possible endocrine disrupters. Concerns exist because of their increasing contamination of the environment, the appearance of bioaccumulation, and their potential for toxicity. In vitro assays alone are unreliable for regulatory purposes, and animal studies are considered indispensable. Modified endocrine responses in some reptiles and marine invertebrates have been observed. In humans, however, a causal relationship between exposure to a specific environmental agent and an adverse health effect due to endocrine modulation has not been established.

\section*{HEAVY METAL I NTOXI CATI ON \& CHELATORS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Some metals such as iron are essential for life, while others such as lead are present in all organisms but serve no useful biologic purpose. Some of the oldest diseases of humans can be traced to heavy metal poisoning associated with metal mining, refining, and use. Even with the present recognition of the hazards of heavy metals, the incidence of intoxication remains significant and the need for preventive strategies and effective therapy remains high. When intoxication occurs, chelator molecules (from chela "claw"), or their in vivo biotransformation products, may be used to bind the metal and facilitate its excretion from the body. Chelator drugs are discussed in the second part of this chapter.

\section*{TOXI COLOGY OF HEAVY METALS}

\section*{LEAD}

Lead poisoning is one of the oldest occupational and environmental diseases in the world. Despite its recognized hazards, lead continues to have widespread commercial application, including production of storage batteries, metal alloys, solder, glass, plastics and ceramics. Environmental lead exposure, ubiquitous by virtue of the anthropogenic distribution of lead to air, water, and food, has declined considerably in the past 3 decades as a result of diminished use of lead in gasoline and other applications. While these public health measures, together with improved workplace conditions, have decreased the incidence of serious overt lead poisoning, there remains considerable concern over the effects of low-level lead exposure. Extensive evidence indicates that lead may have subtle subclinical adverse effects on neurocognitive function and on blood pressure at blood lead concentrations once considered "normal" or "safe." Lead serves no useful purpose in the human body. In key target organs such as the developing central nervous system, no safe threshold of lead exposure has been established.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Inorganic lead is slowly but consistently absorbed via the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Inorganic lead is poorly absorbed through the skin, but organic lead compounds, eg, leaded antiknock gasoline, are well absorbed by this route. Absorption of lead dust via the respiratory tract is the most common cause of industrial poisoning. The intestinal tract is the primary route of entry in nonindustrial exposure (Table 58-1). Absorption via the gastrointestinal tract varies with the nature of the lead compound, but in general, adults absorb about $10-15 \%$ of the ingested amount while young children absorb up to $50 \%$. Low dietary calcium, iron deficiency, and ingestion on an empty stomach have all been associated with increased lead absorption.

Once absorbed from the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract, lead is bound to erythrocytes and widely distributed initially to soft tissues such as the bone marrow, brain, kidney, liver, muscle, and gonads; then to the subperiosteal surface of bone; and later to bone matrix. Lead also crosses the placenta and poses a potential hazard to the fetus. The kinetics of lead clearance from the body follows a multicompartment model, composed predominantly of the blood and soft tissues, with a half-life of 1-2 months; and the skeleton, with a half-life of years to decades. Approximately $70 \%$ of the lead that is eliminated appears in the urine, with lesser amounts excreted through the bile, skin, hair, nails, sweat, and breast milk. The fraction not undergoing prompt excretion, approximately half of the absorbed lead, may be incorporated into the skeleton, the repository of more than $90 \%$ of the body lead burden in most adults. In patients with high bone lead burdens, slow release from the skeleton may elevate blood lead concentrations for years after exposure ceases; and pathologic high bone turnover states such as hyperthyroidism or prolonged immobilization may result in frank lead intoxication. The lead burden in bone has been quantitated using noninvasive x-ray fluorescence, a technique that may provide the best measure of long-term, cumulative lead absorption.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Lead exerts multisystemic toxic effects that are mediated by multiple modes of action, including inhibition of enzymatic function; interference with the action of essential cations, particularly calcium, iron, and zinc; disturbance of cellular redox status; and alteration of the structure of cell membranes and receptors.

\section*{NERVOUS SYSTEM}

The developing central nervous system of the fetus and young child is the most sensitive target organ for lead's toxic effect. Epidemiologic studies suggest that blood lead concentrations less than $5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$ may result in subclinical deficits in neurocognitive function in lead-exposed young children, with no demonstrable threshold for a "no effect" level. Hearing acuity may also be diminished. Adults are less sensitive to the central nervous system effects of lead, but at blood lead concentrations in excess of $30 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$, behavioral and neurocognitive effects may gradually emerge, producing signs and symptoms such as irritability, fatigue, decreased libido, anorexia, sleep disturbance, impaired visual-motor coordination, and slowed
reaction time. Headache, arthralgias, and myalgias are also frequent complaints. Tremor occurs but is less common. Lead encephalopathy, usually occurring at blood lead concentrations in excess of $100 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$, is typically accompanied by increased intracranial pressure and may produce ataxia, stupor, coma, convulsions, and death. Recent studies suggest that lead may accentuate an age-related decline in cognitive function in older adults. There is wide interindividual variation in the magnitude of lead exposure required to cause overt lead-related signs and symptoms.

Peripheral neuropathy may appear after chronic high-dose lead exposure, usually following months to years of blood lead concentrations in excess of $100 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Predominantly motor in character, the neuropathy may present clinically with painless weakness of the extensors, particularly in the upper extremity, resulting in classic wrist-drop. Preclinical signs of lead-induced peripheral nerve dysfunction may be detectable by electrodiagnostic testing.

\section*{BLOOD}

Lead can induce an anemia that may be either normocytic or microcytic and hypochromic. Lead interferes with heme synthesis by blocking the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin IX and by inhibiting the function of enzymes in the heme synthesis pathway, including aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and ferrochelatase. Within 2-8 weeks after an elevation in blood lead concentration (generally to 30-50 mcg/dL or greater), increases in heme precursors, notably free erythrocyte protoporphyrin or its zinc chelate, zinc protoporphyrin, may be detectable in whole blood. Lead also contributes to anemia by increasing erythrocyte membrane fragility and decreasing red cell survival time. Frank hemolysis may occur with high exposure. The presence of basophilic stippling on the peripheral blood smear, thought to be a consequence of lead inhibition of the enzyme $3^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-pyrimidine nucleotidase, is sometimes a suggestive-albeit insensitive and nonspecific-diagnostic clue to the presence of lead intoxication.

\section*{KIDNEYS}

Chronic high-dose lead exposure, usually associated with months to years of blood lead concentrations in excess of $80 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$, may result in renal interstitial fibrosis and nephrosclerosis. Lead nephropathy may have a latency period of years. Lead may alter uric acid excretion by the kidney, resulting in recurrent bouts of gouty arthritis ("saturnine gout"). Acute high-dose lead exposure sometimes produces transient azotemia, possibly as a consequence of intrarenal vasoconstriction.

\section*{REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS}

High-dose lead exposure is a recognized risk factor for stillbirth or spontaneous abortion. Epidemiologic studies of the impact of low-level lead exposure on reproductive outcome such as low birth weight, preterm delivery, or spontaneous abortion have yielded mixed results. However, a well-designed nested casecontrol study recently detected an odds ratio for spontaneous abortion of 1.8 ( $95 \%$ Cl 1.1-3.1) for every 5 $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$ increase in maternal blood lead across an approximate range of $5-20 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$. In males, blood lead concentrations in excess of $40 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$ have been associated with diminished or aberrant sperm production.

\section*{GASTROI NTESTI NAL TRACT}

Moderate lead poisoning may cause loss of appetite, constipation, and, less commonly, diarrhea. At high dosage, intermittent bouts of severe colicky abdominal pain ("lead colic") may occur. The mechanism of lead colic is unclear but is believed to involve spasmodic contraction of the smooth muscles of the intestinal wall. In heavily exposed individuals with poor dental hygiene, the reaction of circulating lead with sulfur ions released by microbial action may produce dark deposits of lead sulfide at the gingival margin ("gingival lead lines"). Although frequently mentioned as a diagnostic clue in the past, in recent times this has been a
relatively rare sign of lead exposure.

\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM}

Epidemiologic, experimental, and in vitro mechanistic data indicate that lead exposure elevates blood pressure in susceptible individuals. In populations with environmental or occupational lead exposure, blood lead concentration is linked with increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Studies of middle-aged and elderly men and women have identified relatively low levels of lead exposure sustained by the general population to be an independent risk factor for hypertension. Lead can also elevate blood pressure in experimental animals. The effect may be caused by an interaction with calcium-mediated contraction of vascular smooth muscle.

\section*{Major Forms of Lead Intoxication}

\section*{INORGANIC LEAD POISONING}
(Table 58-1)

\section*{Acute}

Acute inorganic lead poisoning is uncommon today. It usually results from industrial inhalation of large quantities of lead oxide fumes or, in small children, from ingestion of a large oral dose of lead in lead-based paints or contaminated food or drink. The onset of severe symptoms usually requires several days or weeks of recurrent exposure and presents with signs and symptoms of encephalopathy or colic. Evidence of hemolytic anemia (or anemia with basophilic stippling if exposure has been subacute) and elevated hepatic aminotransferases may be present. The diagnosis of acute inorganic lead poisoning may be difficult, and depending on the presenting symptoms, the condition has sometimes been mistaken for appendicitis, peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, or infectious meningitis. Subacute presentation, featuring headache, fatigue, intermittent abdominal cramps, myalgias, and arthralgias, has often been mistaken for a flu-like viral illness and may not come to medical attention. When there has been recent ingestion of lead-containing paint chips, glazes, or weights, radiopacities may be visible on abdominal radiographs.

\section*{Chronic}

The patient with chronic lead intoxication usually presents with multisystemic findings, including constitutional complaints of anorexia, fatigue, and malaise; neurologic complaints, including headache, difficulty in concentrating, irritability or depressed mood; weakness, arthralgias or myalgias; and gastrointestinal symptoms. Lead poisoning should be strongly suspected in any patient presenting with headache, abdominal pain, and anemia; and less commonly with motor neuropathy, gout, and renal insufficiency. Chronic lead intoxication should be considered in any child with neurocognitive deficits, growth retardation, or developmental delay.

The diagnosis is best confirmed by measuring lead in whole blood. Although this test reflects lead currently circulating in blood and soft tissues and is not a reliable marker of either recent or cumulative lead exposure, most patients with lead-related disease will have blood lead concentrations above the normal range. Average background blood lead concentrations in North America and Europe have declined considerably in recent decades, and the geometric mean blood lead concentration in the United States in 2001-2002 was estimated to be $1.45 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Although predominantly a research tool, the concentration of lead in bone assessed by noninvasive K x-ray fluorescence measurement of lead in bone has been correlated with long-term cumulative lead exposure, and its relationship to numerous lead-related disorders is a subject of ongoing investigation. Measurement of lead excretion in the urine following a single dose of a
chelating agent (sometimes called a "chelation challenge test") primarily reflects the lead content of soft tissues and may not be a reliable marker of long-term lead exposure, remote past exposure, or skeletal lead burden.

\section*{ORGANOLEAD POISONING}

Poisoning from organolead compounds is now very rare, in large part due to the worldwide phase-out of tetraethyl and tetramethyl lead as antiknock additives in gasoline. However, organolead compounds such as lead stearate or lead naphthenate are still used in certain commercial processes. Because of their volatility or lipid solubility, organolead compounds tend to be well absorbed through either the respiratory tract or the skin. Organolead compounds predominantly target the central nervous system, producing dose-dependent effects that may include neurocognitive deficits, insomnia, delirium, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions, and death.

\section*{Treatment}

\section*{INORGANIC LEAD POISONING}

Treatment of inorganic lead poisoning involves immediate termination of exposure, supportive care, and the judicious use of chelation therapy. (Chelation is discussed later in this chapter.) Lead encephalopathy is a medical emergency that requires intensive supportive care. Cerebral edema may improve with corticosteroids and mannitol, and anticonvulsants may be required to treat seizures. Radiopacities on abdominal radiographs may suggest the presence of retained lead objects requiring gastrointestinal decontamination. Adequate urine flow should be maintained, but overhydration should be avoided. Intravenous edetate calcium disodium (CaNa ${ }_{2}$ EDTA) is administered at a dosage of $1000-1500 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{m}^{2} / \mathrm{d}$ (approximately $30-50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) by continuous infusion for up to 5 days. Some clinicians advocate that chelation treatment for lead encephalopathy be initiated with an intramuscular injection of dimercaprol, followed in 4 hours by concurrent administration of dimercaprol and EDTA. Parenteral chelation is limited to 5 or fewer days, at which time oral treatment with another chelator, succimer, may be instituted. In symptomatic lead intoxication without encephalopathy, treatment may sometimes be initiated with succimer. The end point for chelation is usually resolution of symptoms or return of the blood lead concentration to the premorbid range. In patients with chronic exposure, cessation of chelation may be followed by an upward rebound in blood lead concentration as the lead reequilibrates from bone lead stores.

While most clinicians support chelation for symptomatic patients with elevated blood lead concentrations, the decision to chelate asymptomatic subjects is more controversial. Since 1991, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended chelation for all children with blood lead concentrations of 45 $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$ or greater. However, a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of succimer in children with blood lead concentrations between $25 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$ and $44 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$ found no benefit on neurocognitive function or long-term blood lead reduction. Prophylactic use of chelating agents in the workplace should never be a substitute for reduction or prevention of excessive exposure.

\section*{ORGANIC LEAD POISONING}

Initial treatment consists of decontaminating the skin and preventing further exposure. Treatment of seizures requires appropriate use of anticonvulsants. Empiric chelation may be attempted if high blood lead concentrations are present.

\section*{ARSENIC}

Arsenic is a naturally occurring element in the earth's crust with a long history of use as a constituent of commercial and industrial products, as a component in pharmaceuticals, and as an agent of deliberate poisoning. Recent commercial applications of arsenic include its use in the manufacture of semiconductors, wood preservatives for industrial applications (eg, marine timbers or utility poles), nonferrous alloys, glass, gel-based insecticidal ant baits, and veterinary pharmaceuticals. In some regions of the world, groundwater may contain high levels of arsenic that has leached from natural mineral deposits. Arsenic in drinking water in the Ganges delta of India and Bangladesh is now recognized as one of the world's most pressing environmental health problems. Arsine, a hydride gas with potent hemolytic effects, is manufactured predominantly for use in the semiconductor industry but may also be generated accidentally when arseniccontaining ores come in contact with acidic solutions.

It is of historical interest that Fowler's solution, which contains 1\% potassium arsenite, was widely used as a medicine for many conditions from the eighteenth century through the mid-twentieth century. Organic arsenicals were the first pharmaceutical antibiotics* and were widely used for the first half of the twentieth century until supplanted by penicillin and other more effective and less toxic agents.

Other organoarsenicals, most notably lewisite (dichloro[2-chlorovinyl]arsine), were developed in the early twentieth century as chemical warfare agents. Arsenic trioxide was reintroduced into the United States Pharmacopeia in 2000 as an orphan drug for the treatment of relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia and is finding expanded use in experimental cancer treatment protocols (see Chapter 55). Melarsoprol, another trivalent arsenical, is used in the treatment of advanced African trypanosomiasis (see Chapter 53).
* Paul Ehrlich's "magic bullet" for syphilis (arsphenamine; Salvarsan) was an arsenical.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Soluble arsenic compounds are well absorbed through the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (Table 58-1). Percutaneous absorption is limited but may be clinically significant after heavy exposure to concentrated arsenic reagents. Most of the absorbed inorganic arsenic undergoes methylation, mainly in the liver, to monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid, which are excreted, along with residual inorganic arsenic, in the urine. When chronic daily absorption is less than 1000 mcg of soluble inorganic arsenic, approximately two thirds of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine. After massive ingestions, the elimination half-life is prolonged. Inhalation of arsenic compounds of low solubility may result in prolonged retention in the lung and may not be reflected by urinary arsenic excretion. Arsenic binds to sulfhydryl groups present in keratinized tissue, and following cessation of exposure, hair, nails, and skin may contain elevated levels after urine values have returned to normal. However, arsenic present in hair and nails as a result of external deposition may be indistinguishable from that incorporated after internal absorption.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Arsenic compounds are thought to exert their toxic effects by several modes of action. Interference with enzymatic function may result from sulfhydryl group binding by trivalent arsenic or by substitution for phosphate. Inorganic arsenic or its metabolites may induce oxidative stress, alter gene expression, and interfere with cell signal transduction. Although on a molar basis inorganic trivalent arsenic ( $\mathrm{As}^{3+}$, arsenite) is generally two to ten times more acutely toxic than inorganic pentavalent arsenic ( $\mathrm{As}^{5+}$, arsenate), in vivo interconversion is known to occur, and the full spectrum of arsenic toxicity has occurred after sufficient exposure to either form. Recent studies suggest that the trivalent form of the methylated metabolites (eg,
monomethylarsonous acid [MMA ${ }^{\text {III }}$ ]) may be more toxic than the inorganic parent compounds. Arsine gas is oxidized in vivo and exerts a potent hemolytic effect associated with alteration of ion flux across the erythrocyte membrane; however, it also disrupts cellular respiration in other tissues. Arsenic is a recognized human carcinogen and has been associated with cancer of the lung, skin, and bladder. Marine organisms may contain large amounts of a well-absorbed trimethylated organoarsenic, arsenobetaine, as well as a variety of arsenosugars. Arsenobetaine exerts no known toxic effects when ingested by mammals and is excreted in the urine unchanged; arsenosugars are partially metabolized to dimethylarsinic acid.

\section*{Major Forms of Arsenic Intoxication}

\section*{ACUTE INORGANIC ARSENIC POISONING}

Within minutes to hours after exposure to high doses (tens to hundreds of milligrams) of soluble inorganic arsenic compounds, many systems are affected. I nitial gastrointestinal signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Diffuse capillary leak, combined with gastrointestinal fluid loss, may result in hypotension, shock, and death. Cardiopulmonary toxicity, including congestive cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and ventricular arrhythmias, may occur promptly or after a delay of several days. Pancytopenia usually develops within a week, and basophilic stippling of erythrocytes may be present soon after. Central nervous system effects, including delirium, encephalopathy, and coma, may occur within the first few days of intoxication. An ascending sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy may begin to develop after a delay of 2-6 weeks. This neuropathy may ultimately involve the proximal musculature and result in neuromuscular respiratory failure. Months after an episode of acute poisoning, transverse white striae (Aldrich-Mees lines) may be visible in the nails.

Acute inorganic arsenic poisoning should be considered in an individual presenting with abrupt onset of gastroenteritis in combination with hypotension and metabolic acidosis. Suspicion should be further heightened when these initial findings are followed by cardiac dysfunction, pancytopenia, and peripheral neuropathy. The diagnosis may be confirmed by demonstration of elevated amounts of inorganic arsenic and its metabolites in the urine (typically in the range of several thousand micrograms in the first 2-3 days following acute symptomatic poisoning). Arsenic disappears rapidly from the blood, and except in anuric patients, blood arsenic levels should not be used for diagnostic purposes. Treatment is based on appropriate gut decontamination, intensive supportive care, and prompt chelation with unithiol, $3-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ intravenously every 4-6 hours, or dimercaprol, $3-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ intramuscularly every 4-6 hours. In animal studies, the efficacy of chelation has been highest when it is administered within minutes to hours after arsenic exposure; therefore, if diagnostic suspicion is high, treatment should not be withheld for the several days to weeks often required to obtain laboratory confirmation. Succimer has also been effective in animal models and has a higher therapeutic index than dimercaprol. However, because it is available in the United States only for oral administration, its use may not be advisable in the initial treatment of acute arsenic poisoning, when severe gastroenteritis and splanchnic edema may limit absorption by this route.

\section*{CHRONIC INORGANIC ARSENIC POISONING}

Chronic inorganic arsenic poisoning also results in multisystemic signs and symptoms. Overt noncarcinogenic effects may be evident after chronic absorption of more than $500-1000 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{d}$. The time to appearance of symptoms will vary with dose and interindividual tolerance. Constitutional symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and weakness may be present, along with anemia, nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints, and a sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, particularly featuring a stocking-glove pattern of dysesthesia. Skin changes—among the most characteristic effects—typically develop after years of
exposure and include a "raindrop" pattern of hyperpigmentation, and hyperkeratoses involving the palms and soles. Peripheral vascular disease and noncirrhotic portal hypertension may also occur. Epidemiologic studies suggest a possible link to hypertension, diabetes, and chronic nonmalignant respiratory disease. Cancer of the lung, skin, bladder, and possibly other sites, may appear years after exposure to doses of arsenic that are not high enough to elicit other acute or chronic effects. Administration of arsenite in cancer chemotherapy regimens, often at a daily dose of $10-20 \mathrm{mg}$ for weeks to a few months, has been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram and occasionally has resulted in malignant ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes.

The diagnosis of chronic arsenic poisoning involves integration of the clinical findings with confirmation of exposure. Urinary levels of total arsenic, usually less than $30 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{L}$ or $50 \mathrm{mcg} / 24 \mathrm{~h}$ in the general population, may return to normal within days to weeks after exposure ceases. Because it may contain large amounts of nontoxic organoarsenic, all seafood should be avoided for at least 3 days prior to submission of a urine sample for diagnostic purposes. The arsenic content of hair and nails (normally less than 1 ppm) may sometimes reveal past elevated exposure, but results should be interpreted cautiously in view of the potential for external contamination.

\section*{ARSINE GAS POISONI NG}

Arsine gas poisoning produces a distinctive pattern of intoxication dominated by profound hemolytic effects. After a latent period that may range from 2 hours to 24 hours postinhalation (depending on the magnitude of exposure), massive intravascular hemolysis may occur. Initial symptoms may include malaise, headache, dyspnea, weakness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, and hemoglobinuria. Oliguric renal failure, a consequence of hemoglobin deposition in the renal tubules, often appears within 1-3 days. In massive exposures, lethal effects on cellular respiration may occur before renal failure develops. Urinary arsenic levels are elevated but will seldom be available to confirm the diagnosis during the critical period of illness. Intensive supportive care-including exchange transfusion, vigorous hydration, and, in the case of acute renal failure, hemodialysis-is the mainstay of therapy. Currently available chelating agents have not been demonstrated to be of clinical value in arsine poisoning.

\section*{MERCURY}

Metallic mercury as "quicksilver"-the only metal that is liquid under ordinary conditions-has attracted scholarly and scientific interest from antiquity. In early times it was recognized that the mining of mercury was hazardous to health. As industrial use of mercury became common during the past 200 years, new forms of toxicity were recognized that were found to be associated with various transformations of the metal. In the early 1950s, a mysterious epidemic of birth defects and neurologic disease occurred in the Japanese fishing village of Minamata. The causative agent was determined to be methylmercury in contaminated seafood, traced to industrial discharges into the bay from a nearby factory. In addition to elemental mercury and alkylmercury (including methylmercury), other key mercurials include inorganic mercury salts and aryl mercury compounds, each of which exerts a relatively unique pattern of clinical toxicity.

Mercury is mined predominantly as HgS in cinnabar ore and is then converted commercially to a variety of chemical forms. Key industrial and commercial applications of mercury are found in the electrolytic production of chlorine and caustic soda; the manufacture of electrical equipment, thermometers, and other instruments; fluorescent lamps; dental amalgam; and artisanal gold production. Use in pharmaceuticals and in biocides has declined substantially in recent years, but occasional use in antiseptics and folk
medicines is still encountered. Environmental exposure to mercury from the burning of fossil fuels-or the bioaccumulation of methylmercury in fish-remains a concern in some regions of the world. Low-level exposure to mercury released from dental amalgam fillings occurs, but systemic toxicity from this source has not been established.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

The absorption of mercury varies considerably depending on the chemical form of the metal. Elemental mercury is quite volatile and can be absorbed from the lungs (Table 58-1). It is poorly absorbed from the intact gastrointestinal tract. Inhaled mercury is the primary source of occupational exposure. Organic shortchain alkylmercury compounds are volatile and potentially harmful by inhalation as well as by ingestion. Percutaneous absorption of metallic mercury and inorganic mercury can be of clinical concern following massive acute or long-term chronic exposure. Alkylmercury compounds appear to be well absorbed through the skin, and acute contact with a few drops of dimethylmercury has resulted in severe, delayed toxicity. After absorption, mercury is distributed to the tissues within a few hours, with the highest concentration occurring in the kidney. Inorganic mercury is excreted through the urine and the feces. Excretion of inorganic mercury follows a multicomponent model: most is excreted within weeks to months, but a fraction may be retained in the kidneys and brain for years. Following inhalation of elemental mercury vapor, urinary mercury levels decline with a half-life of approximately 1-3 months. Methylmercury, which has a blood and whole body half-life of approximately 50 days, undergoes biliary excretion and enterohepatic circulation, with more than two thirds eventually excreted in the feces. Mercury binds to sulfhydryl groups in keratinized tissue, and, as with lead and arsenic, traces appear in the hair and nails.

\section*{Major Forms of Mercury I ntoxication}

Mercury interacts with sulfhydryl groups in vivo, inhibiting enzymes and altering cell membranes. The pattern of clinical intoxication from mercury depends to a great extent on the chemical form of the metal and the route and severity of exposure.

\section*{ACUTE}

Acute inhalation of elemental mercury vapors may cause chemical pneumonitis and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Acute gingivostomatitis may occur, and neurologic sequelae (see below) may also ensue. Acute ingestion of inorganic mercury salts, such as mercuric chloride, can result in a corrosive, potentially life-threatening hemorrhagic gastroenteritis followed within hours to days by acute tubular necrosis and oliguric renal failure.

\section*{CHRONIC}

Chronic poisoning from inhalation of mercury vapor results in a classic triad of tremor, neuropsychiatric disturbance, and gingivostomatitis. The tremor usually begins as a fine intention tremor of the hands, but the face may also be involved, and progression to choreiform movements of the limbs may occur. Neuropsychiatric manifestations, including memory loss, fatigue, insomnia, and anorexia, are common. There may be an insidious change in mood to shyness, withdrawal, and depression along with explosive anger or blushing (a behavioral pattern referred to as erethism ). Recent studies suggest that low-dose exposure may produce subclinical neurologic effects. Gingivostomatitis, sometimes accompanied by loosening of the teeth, may be reported after high-dose exposure. Evidence of peripheral nerve damage may be detected on electrodiagnostic testing, but overt peripheral neuropathy is rare. Acrodynia is an uncommon idiosyncratic reaction to subacute or chronic mercury exposure and occurs mainly in children. It
is characterized by painful erythema of the extremities and may be associated with hypertension, diaphoresis, anorexia, insomnia, irritability or apathy, and a miliarial rash.

Methylmercury intoxication affects mainly the central nervous system and results in paresthesias, ataxia, hearing impairment, dysarthria, and progressive constriction of the visual fields. Signs and symptoms may first appear several weeks or months after exposure begins. Methylmercury is a reproductive toxin. Highdose prenatal exposure to methylmercury may produce mental retardation and a cerebral palsy-like syndrome in the offspring. Low-level prenatal exposures have been associated with a risk of subclinical neurodevelopmental deficits. Dimethylmercury is a rarely encountered but extremely neurotoxic form of organomercury that may be lethal in small quantities.

The diagnosis of mercury intoxication involves integration of the history and physical findings with confirmatory laboratory testing or other evidence of exposure. In the absence of occupational exposure, the urine mercury concentration is usually less than $5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{L}$, and whole blood mercury is less than $5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{L}$. In 1990, the Biological Exposure Index (BEI) Committee of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) recommended that workplace exposures should result in urinary mercury concentrations less than 35 mcg per gram of creatinine and end-of-workweek whole blood mercury concentrations less than $15 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{L}$. To minimize the risk of developmental neurotoxicity from methylmercury, the US Environmental Protection Agency and Food and Drug Administration have advised pregnant women, women who might become pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children to avoid consumption of fish with high mercury levels (eg, swordfish), and to limit consumption of fish with lower levels of mercury to no more than 12 ounces ( 340 g , or two average meals) per week.

\section*{Treatment}

\section*{ACUTE EXPOSURE}

In addition to intensive supportive care, prompt chelation with oral or intravenous unithiol, intramuscular dimercaprol, or oral succimer may be of value in diminishing nephrotoxicity after acute exposure to inorganic mercury salts. Vigorous hydration may help to maintain urine output, but if acute renal failure ensues, days to weeks of hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration in conjunction with chelation may be necessary. Because the efficacy of chelation declines with time since exposure, treatment should not be delayed until the onset of oliguria or other major systemic effects.

\section*{CHRONIC EXPOSURE}

Unithiol and succimer increase urine mercury excretion following acute or chronic elemental mercury inhalation, but the impact of such treatment on clinical outcome is unknown. Dimercaprol has been shown to redistribute mercury to the central nervous system from other tissue sites, and since the brain is a key target organ, dimercaprol should not be used in treatment of exposure to elemental or organic mercury. Limited data suggest that succimer, unithiol, and N- acetyl- L-cysteine (NAC) may enhance body clearance of methylmercury.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGY OF CHELATORS}

Chelating agents are drugs used to prevent or reverse the toxic effects of a heavy metal on an enzyme or other cellular target, or to accelerate the elimination of the metal from the body. Chelating agents are usually flexible molecules with two or more electronegative groups that form stable coordinate-covalent bonds with a cationic metal atom. In some cases, eg, succimer, the parent compound may require in vivo
biotransformation to become an active complexing agent. The chelator-metal complexes formed are excreted by the body. Edetate (ethylenediaminetetraacetate, Figure 58-1) is an important example.

The efficiency of the chelator is partly determined by the number of ligand groups on the molecule available for metal binding. The greater the number of these ligand groups, the more stable the metal-chelator complex. Depending on the number of metal-ligand bonds, the complex may be referred to as mono-, bi-, or polydentate. The chelating ligand groups include functional groups such as $-\mathrm{OH},-\mathrm{SH}$, and -NH , which can donate electrons for coordination with the metal. Such bonding effectively prevents interaction of the metal with similar functional groups of enzymes or other proteins, coenzymes, cellular nucleophiles, and membranes.

In addition to removing the target metal that is exerting toxic effects on the body, some chelating agents (such as calcium EDTA used for lead intoxication) may enhance the excretion of essential cations such as zinc or copper. However, this side effect is seldom of clinical significance during the limited time frame that characterizes most courses of therapeutic chelation.

In some cases, the metal-mobilizing effect of a therapeutic chelating agent may not only enhance that metal's excretion-a desired effect-but may also redistribute some of the metal to other vital organs. This has been demonstrated for dimercaprol, which redistributes mercury and arsenic to the brain while also enhancing urinary mercury and arsenic excretion. Although several chelating agents have the capacity to mobilize cadmium, their tendency to redistribute cadmium to the kidney and increase nephrotoxicity has negated their therapeutic value in cadmium intoxication.

In most cases, the capacity of chelating agents to prevent or reduce the adverse effects of toxic metals appears to be greatest when they are administered very soon after an acute metal exposure. Use of chelating agents days to weeks after an acute metal exposure ends-or their use in the treatment of chronic metal intoxication-may still be associated with increased metal excretion. However, at that point, the capacity of such enhanced excretion to mitigate the pathologic effect of the metal exposure may be reduced.

The most important chelating agents currently in use in the USA are described below.

\section*{DI MERCAPROL (2,3-DI MERCAPTOPROPANOL, BAL)}

Dimercaprol (Figure 58-2), an oily, colorless liquid with a strong mercaptan-like odor, was developed in Great Britain during World War II as a therapeutic antidote against poisoning by the arsenic-containing warfare agent lewisite. It thus became known as British anti-Lewisite, or BAL. Because aqueous solutions of dimercaprol are unstable and oxidize readily, it is dispensed in 10\% solution in peanut oil and must be administered by intramuscular injection, which is often painful.

In animal models, dimercaprol prevents and reverses arsenic-induced inhibition of sulfhydryl-containing enzymes and, if given soon after exposure, may protect against the lethal effects of inorganic and organic arsenicals. Human data indicate that it can increase the rate of excretion of arsenic and lead and may offer therapeutic benefit in the treatment of acute intoxication by arsenic, lead, and mercury.

\section*{Indications \& Toxicity}

Dimercaprol is FDA-approved as single-agent treatment of acute poisoning by arsenic and inorganic mercury and for the treatment of severe lead poisoning when used in conjunction with edetate calcium disodium (EDTA; see below). Although studies of its metabolism in humans are limited, intramuscularly administered dimercaprol appears to be readily absorbed, metabolized, and excreted by the kidney within 4-8 hours. Animal models indicate that it may also undergo biliary excretion, but the role of this excretory route in humans and other details of its biotransformation are uncertain.

When used in therapeutic doses, dimercaprol is associated with a high incidence of adverse effects, including hypertension, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, lacrimation, salivation, fever (particularly in children), and pain at the injection site. Its use has also been associated with thrombocytopenia and increased prothrombin time-factors that may limit intramuscular injection because of the risk of hematoma formation at the injection site. Despite its protective effects in acutely intoxicated animals, dimercaprol may
redistribute arsenic and mercury to the central nervous system, and it is not advocated for treatment of chronic poisoning. Water-soluble analogs of dimercaprol-unithiol and succimer-have higher therapeutic indices and have replaced dimercaprol in many settings.

\section*{SUCCI MER (DI MERCAPTOSUCCI NIC ACID, DMSA)}

Succimer is a water-soluble analog of dimercaprol, and like that agent it has been shown in animal studies to prevent and reverse metal-induced inhibition of sulfhydryl-containing enzymes and to protect against the acute lethal effects of arsenic. In humans, treatment with succimer is associated with an increase in urinary lead excretion and a decrease in blood lead concentration. It may also decrease the mercury content of the kidney, a key target organ of inorganic mercury salts. In the USA, succimer is formulated exclusively for oral use, but intravenous formulations have been used successfully elsewhere. It is absorbed rapidly but somewhat variably after oral administration. Peak blood levels occur at approximately 3 hours. The drug binds in vivo to the amino acid cysteine to form $1: 1$ and $1: 2$ mixed disulfides, possibly in the kidney, and it may be these complexes that are the active chelating moieties. The elimination half-time of transformed succimer is approximately $2-4$ hours.

\section*{Indications \& Toxicity}

Succimer is currently FDA-approved for the treatment of children with blood lead concentrations greater than $45 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$, but it is also commonly used in adults. The usual dosage is $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ orally three times a day. Oral administration of succimer is comparable to parenteral EDTA in reducing blood lead concentration and has supplanted EDTA in outpatient treatment of patients capable of absorbing the oral drug. However, despite the demonstrated capacity of both succimer and EDTA to enhance lead elimination, their value in reversing established lead toxicity or in otherwise improving therapeutic outcome has yet to be established by a placebo-controlled clinical trial. Based on its protective effects against arsenic in animals and its ability to mobilize mercury from the kidney, succimer has also been used in the treatment of arsenic and mercury poisoning. Succimer has been well tolerated in limited clinical trials. It has a negligible impact on body stores of calcium, iron, and magnesium. It induces a mild increase in urinary excretion of zinc that is of minor or no clinical significance. Gastrointestinal disturbances, including anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are the most common side effects, occurring in less than $10 \%$ of patients. Rashes, sometimes requiring discontinuation of the medication, have been reported in less than $5 \%$ of patients. Mild, reversible increases in liver aminotransferases have been noted in 6-10\% of patients, and isolated cases of mild to moderate neutropenia have been reported.

\section*{EDETATE CALCI UM DI SODI UM (ETHYLENEDI AMI NETETRAACETI C ACI D [EDTA])}

Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Figure 58-1) is an efficient chelator of many divalent and trivalent metals in vitro. To prevent potentially life-threatening depletion of calcium, the drug should only be administered as the calcium disodium salt.

EDTA penetrates cell membranes relatively poorly and therefore chelates extracellular metal ions much more effectively than intracellular ions.

The highly polar ionic character of EDTA limits its oral absorption. Moreover, oral administration may increase lead absorption from the gut. Consequently, EDTA should be administered by intravenous infusion. In patients with normal renal function, EDTA is rapidly excreted by glomerular filtration, with $50 \%$ of an
injected dose appearing in the urine within 1 hour. EDTA mobilizes lead from soft tissues, causing a marked increase in urinary lead excretion and a corresponding decline in blood lead concentration. In patients with renal insufficiency, excretion of the drug-and its metal-mobilizing effects-may be delayed.

\section*{Indications \& Toxicity}

Edetate calcium disodium is indicated chiefly for the chelation of lead, but it may also have utility in poisoning by zinc, manganese, and certain heavy radionuclides. In spite of repeated claims in the alternative medicine literature, EDTA has no demonstrated utility in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Because the drug and the mobilized metals are excreted via the urine, the drug is relatively contraindicated in anuric patients. In such instances, the use of low doses of EDTA in combination with hemodialysis or hemofiltration has been described. Nephrotoxicity from EDTA has been reported, but in most cases this can be prevented by maintenance of adequate urine flow, avoidance of excessive doses, and limitation of a treatment course to 5 or fewer consecutive days. EDTA may result in temporary zinc depletion that is of uncertain clinical significance. Analogs of EDTA, the calcium and zinc disodium salts of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), pentetate, have been used for removal ("decorporation") of uranium and certain transuranic radioisotopes, and in 2004 were approved by the FDA for treatment of contamination with plutonium, americium, and curium.

\section*{UNITHI OL (DI MERCAPTOPROPANESULFONIC ACID, DMPS)}

Unithiol, a dimercapto chelating agent that is a water-soluble analog of dimercaprol, has been available in the official formularies of Russia and other former Soviet countries since 1958 and in Germany since 1976. It has been legally available from compounding pharmacists in the USA since 1999. Unithiol can be administered orally and intravenously. Bioavailability by the oral route is approximately $50 \%$, with peak blood levels occurring in approximately 3.7 hours. Over $80 \%$ of an intravenous dose is excreted in the urine, mainly as cyclic DMPS sulfides. The elimination half-time for total unithiol (parent drug and its transformation products) is approximately 20 hours. Unithiol exhibits protective effects against the toxic action of mercury and arsenic in animal models, and it increases the excretion of mercury, arsenic, and lead in humans.

\section*{Unithiol}

\section*{Indications \& Toxicity}

Unithiol has no FDA-approved indications, but experimental studies and its pharmacologic and pharmacodynamic profile suggest that intravenous unithiol offers advantages over intramuscular dimercaprol or oral succimer in the initial treatment of severe acute poisoning by inorganic mercury or arsenic. Aqueous preparations of unithiol (usually $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}$ in sterile water) can be administered at a dose of $3-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ every 4 hours by slow intravenous infusion over 20 minutes. If a few days of treatment are accompanied by stabilization of the patient's cardiovascular and gastrointestinal status, it may be possible to change to oral administration at a dose of $4-8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ every $6-8$ hours. Oral unithiol may also be considered as an alternative to oral succimer in the treatment of lead intoxication.

Unithiol has been reported to have a low overall incidence of adverse effects ( $<4 \%$ ). Self-limited dermatologic reactions (drug exanthems or urticaria) are the most commonly reported adverse effects, although isolated cases of major allergic reactions, including erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported. Because rapid intravenous infusion may cause vasodilation and hypotension, unithiol should be infused slowly over an interval of 15-20 minutes.

\section*{PENI CI LLAMI NE ( D -DI METHYLCYSTEI NE)}

Penicillamine (Figure 58-2) is a white crystalline, water-soluble derivative of penicillin. D -Penicillamine is less toxic than the Lisomer and consequently is the preferred therapeutic form. Penicillamine is readily absorbed from the gut and is resistant to metabolic degradation.

\section*{Indications \& Toxicity}

Penicillamine is used chiefly for treatment of poisoning with copper or to prevent copper accumulation, as in Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration). It is also used occasionally in the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis (see Chapter 36). Its ability to increase urinary excretion of lead and mercury had occasioned its use as outpatient treatment for intoxication with these metals, but succimer, with its stronger metal-mobilizing capacity and lower side effect profile, has generally replaced penicillamine for these purposes.

Adverse effects have been seen in up to one third of patients receiving penicillamine. Hypersensitivity reactions include rash, pruritus, and drug fever, and the drug should be used with extreme caution, if at all, in patients with a history of penicillin allergy. Nephrotoxicity with proteinuria has also been reported, and protracted use of the drug may result in renal insufficiency. Pancytopenia has been associated with prolonged drug intake. Pyridoxine deficiency is a frequent toxic effect of other forms of the drug but is rarely seen with the D form. An acetylated derivative, N - acetylpenicillamine, has been used experimentally in mercury poisoning and may have superior metal-mobilizing capacity, but it is not commercially available.

\section*{DEFEROXAMI NE}

Deferoxamine is isolated from Streptomyces pilosus. It binds iron avidly but essential trace metals poorly. Furthermore, while competing for loosely bound iron in iron-carrying proteins (hemosiderin and ferritin), it fails to compete for biologically chelated iron, as in microsomal and mitochondrial cytochromes and hemoproteins. Consequently, it is the parenteral chelator of choice for iron poisoning (see Chapters 33 and 59). Deferoxamine plus hemodialysis may also be useful in the treatment of aluminum toxicity in renal failure. Deferoxamine is poorly absorbed when administered orally and may increase iron absorption when given by this route. It should therefore be administered intramuscularly or, preferably, intravenously. It is believed to be metabolized, but the pathways are unknown. The iron-chelator complex is excreted in the urine, often turning the urine an orange-red color.

Rapid intravenous administration may result in hypotension. Adverse idiosyncratic responses such as flushing, abdominal discomfort, and rash have also been observed. Pulmonary complications (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome) have been reported in some patients undergoing deferoxamine infusions lasting longer than 24 hours, and neurotoxicity and increased susceptibility to certain infections (eg, with Yersinia enterocolitica ) have been described after long-term therapy of iron overload conditions (eg, thalassemia major).

\section*{DEFERASI ROX}

Deferasirox is a tridentate chelator with a high affinity for iron and low affinity for other metals, eg, zinc and copper. It is orally active and well absorbed. In the circulation it binds iron, and the complex is excreted in the bile. Deferasirox was recently approved for the oral treatment of iron overload caused by blood transfusions, a problem in the treatment of thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.

\section*{PRUSSI AN BLUE (FERRIC HEXACYANOFERRATE)}

Ferric hexacyanoferrate (insoluble Prussian blue) is a hydrated crystalline compound in which Fell and Felll atoms are coordinated with cyanide groups in a cubic lattice structure. Although used as a dark blue commercial pigment for nearly 300 years, it was only 3 decades ago that its potential utility as a pharmaceutical chelator was recognized. Primarily by ion-exchange, and secondarily by mechanical trapping or adsorption, the compound has high affinity for certain univalent cations, particularly cesium and thallium. Used as an oral drug, insoluble Prussian blue undergoes minimal gastrointestinal absorption (< 1\%). Because the complexes it forms with cesium or thallium are nonabsorbable, oral administration of the chelator diminishes intestinal absorption or interrupts enterohepatic and enteroenteric circulation of these cations, thereby accelerating their elimination in the feces. In clinical case series, the use of Prussian blue has been associated with a decline in the biologic half-life (ie, in vivo retention) of radioactive cesium and thallium.

\section*{Indications \& Toxicity}

In 2003, the FDA approved Prussian blue for the treatment of contamination with radioactive cesium ( 137 Cs), and for intoxication with thallium salts. Approval was prompted by concern over potential widespread human contamination with radioactive cesium caused by terrorist use of a radioactive dispersal device ("dirty bomb"). The drug is part of the Strategic National Stockpile of pharmaceuticals and medical material maintained by the CDC (http://www.bt.cdc.gov/stockpile/ \#material) (Note: Although soluble forms of Prussian blue, such as potassium ferric hexacyanoferrate, may have better utility in thallium poisoning, only the insoluble form is currently available as a pharmaceutical.)

Following exposure to ${ }^{137}$ Cs or thallium salts, the approved adult dosage is 3 g orally three times a day; the corresponding pediatric dosage ( $2-12$ years of age) is 1 g orally three times a day. Serial monitoring of urine and fecal radioactivity ( ${ }^{137} \mathrm{Cs}$ ) and urinary thallium concentrations can guide the recommended duration of therapy. Adjunctive supportive care for possible acute radiation illness ( ${ }^{137} \mathrm{Cs}$ ) or systemic thallium toxicity should be instituted as needed.

Prussian blue has not been associated with significant adverse effects. Constipation, which may occur in some cases, should be treated with laxatives or increased dietary fiber.

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF THE POI SONED PATI ENT: INTRODUCTI ON}

Over a million cases of acute poisoning occur in the USA each year, although only a small fraction are fatal. Most deaths are due to intentional suicidal overdose by an adolescent or adult. Childhood deaths due to accidental ingestion of a drug or toxic household product have been markedly reduced in the past 30 years as a result of safety packaging and effective poisoning prevention education.

Even with a serious exposure, poisoning is rarely fatal if the victim receives prompt medical attention and good supportive care. Careful management of respiratory failure, hypotension, seizures, and thermoregulatory disturbances has resulted in improved survival of patients who reach the hospital alive.

This chapter reviews the basic principles of poisoning, initial management, and specialized treatment of poisoning, including methods of increasing the elimination of drugs and toxins.

\section*{TOXI COKI NETI CS \& TOXI CODYNAMI CS}

The term toxicokinetics denotes the absorption, distribution, excretion, and metabolism of toxins, toxic doses of therapeutic agents, and their metabolites. The term toxicodynamics is used to denote the injurious effects of these substances on vital function. Although there are many similarities between the pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics of most substances, there are also important differences. The same caution applies to pharmacodynamics and toxicodynamics.

\section*{SPECI AL ASPECTS OF TOXI COKI NETI CS}

\section*{Volume of Distribution}

The volume of distribution ( $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{d}}$ ) is defined as the apparent volume into which a substance is distributed (see Chapter 3). A large $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{d}}$ implies that the drug is not readily accessible to measures aimed at purifying the blood, such as hemodialysis. Examples of drugs with large volumes of distribution (> 5 L/kg) include antidepressants, antipsychotics, antimalarials, narcotics, propranolol, and verapamil. Drugs with relatively small volumes of distribution ( $<1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) include salicylate, ethanol, phenobarbital, lithium, valproic acid, and phenytoin (see Table 3-1).

\section*{Clearance}

Clearance is a measure of the volume of plasma that is cleared of drug per unit time (see Chapter 3). For most drugs the total clearance is the sum of clearances via excretion by the kidneys and metabolism by the liver. In planning detoxification strategy, it is important to know the contribution of each organ to total clearance. For example, if a drug is $95 \%$ cleared by liver metabolism and only $5 \%$ cleared by renal excretion, even a dramatic increase in urinary concentration of the poison will have little effect on overall elimination.

Overdosage of a drug can alter the usual pharmacokinetic processes, and this must be considered when applying kinetics to poisoned patients. For example, dissolution of tablets or gastric emptying time may be slowed so that absorption and peak toxic effects are delayed. Drugs may injure the epithelial barrier of the gastrointestinal tract and thereby increase absorption. If the capacity of the liver to metabolize a drug is exceeded, more drug will be delivered to the circulation. With a dramatic
increase in the concentration of drug in the blood, protein-binding capacity may be exceeded, resulting in an increased fraction of free drug and greater toxic effect. At normal dosage, most drugs are eliminated at a rate proportionate to the plasma concentration (first-order kinetics). If the plasma concentration is very high and normal metabolism is saturated, the rate of elimination may become fixed (zero-order kinetics). This change in kinetics may markedly prolong the apparent serum half-life and increase toxicity.

\section*{SPECI AL ASPECTS OF TOXI CODYNAMI CS}

The general dose-response principles described in Chapter 2 are relevant when estimating the potential severity of an intoxication. When considering quantal dose-response data, both the therapeutic index and the overlap of therapeutic and toxic response curves must be considered. For instance, two drugs may have the same therapeutic index but unequal safe dosing ranges if the slopes of their dose-response curves are not the same. For some drugs, eg, sedative-hypnotics, the major toxic effect is a direct extension of the therapeutic action, as shown by their graded dose-response curve (see Figure 22-1). In the case of a drug with a linear dose-response curve (drug A), lethal effects may occur at ten times the normal therapeutic dose. In contrast, a drug with a curve that reaches a plateau (drug B) may not be lethal at 100 times the normal dose.

For many drugs, at least part of the toxic effect may be quite different from the therapeutic action. For example, intoxication with drugs that have atropine-like effects (eg, tricyclic antidepressants) will reduce sweating, making it more difficult to dissipate heat. In tricyclic antidepressant intoxication, there may also be increased muscular activity or seizures; the body's production of heat is thus enhanced, and lethal hyperpyrexia may result. Overdoses of drugs that depress the cardiovascular system, eg, Bblockers or calcium channel blockers, can profoundly alter not only cardiac function but all functions that are dependent on blood flow. These include renal and hepatic elimination of the toxin and any other drugs that may be given.

\section*{APPROACH TO THE POI SONED PATI ENT HOW DOES THE POISONED PATI ENT DI E?}

An understanding of common mechanisms of death due to poisoning can help prepare the physician to treat patients effectively. Many toxins depress the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in obtundation or coma. Comatose patients frequently lose their airway protective reflexes and their respiratory drive. Thus, they may die as a result of airway obstruction by the flaccid tongue, aspiration of gastric contents into the tracheobronchial tree, or respiratory arrest. These are the most common causes of death due to overdoses of narcotics and sedative-hypnotic drugs (eg, barbiturates and alcohol).

Cardiovascular toxicity is also frequently encountered in poisoning. Hypotension may be due to depression of cardiac contractility; hypovolemia resulting from vomiting, diarrhea, or fluid sequestration; peripheral vascular collapse due to blockade of a or cardiac arrhythmias. Hypothermia or hyperthermia due to exposure as well as the temperaturedysregulating effects of many drugs can also produce hypotension. Lethal arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation can occur with overdoses of many cardioactive drugs such as ephedrine, amphetamines, cocaine, digitalis, and theophylline; and drugs not usually considered
cardioactive, such as tricyclic antidepressants, antihistamines, and some opioid analogs.
Cellular hypoxia may occur in spite of adequate ventilation and oxygen administration when poisoning is due to cyanide, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide, and other poisons that interfere with transport or utilization of oxygen. In such patients, cellular hypoxia is evident by the development of tachycardia, hypotension, severe lactic acidosis, and signs of ischemia on the electrocardiogram.

Seizures, muscular hyperactivity, and rigidity may result in death. Seizures may cause pulmonary aspiration, hypoxia, and brain damage. Hyperthermia may result from sustained muscular hyperactivity and can lead to muscle breakdown and myoglobinuria, renal failure, lactic acidosis, and hyperkalemia. Drugs and poisons that often cause seizures include antidepressants, isoniazid (INH), diphenhydramine, cocaine, and amphetamines.

Other organ system damage may occur after poisoning and is sometimes delayed in onset. Paraquat attacks lung tissue, resulting in pulmonary fibrosis, beginning several days after ingestion. Massive hepatic necrosis due to poisoning by acetaminophen or certain mushrooms results in hepatic encephalopathy and death 48-72 hours or longer after ingestion.

Finally, some patients may die before hospitalization because the behavioral effects of the ingested drug may result in traumatic injury. Intoxication with alcohol and other sedative-hypnotic drugs is a frequent contributing factor to motor vehicle accidents. Patients under the influence of hallucinogens such as phencyclidine (PCP) or LSD may die in fights or falls from high places.

\section*{I NITI AL MANAGEMENT OF THE POI SONED PATI ENT}

The initial management of a patient with coma, seizures, or otherwise altered mental status should follow the same approach regardless of the poison involved. Attempting to make a specific toxicologic diagnosis only delays the application of supportive measures that form the basis ("ABCDs") of poisoning treatment.

First, the airway should be cleared of vomitus or any other obstruction and an oral airway or endotracheal tube inserted if needed. For many patients, simple positioning in the lateral decubitus position is sufficient to move the flaccid tongue out of the airway. Breathing should be assessed by observation and oximetry and, if in doubt, by measuring arterial blood gases. Patients with respiratory insufficiency should be intubated and mechanically ventilated. The circulation should be assessed by continuous monitoring of pulse rate, blood pressure, urinary output, and evaluation of peripheral perfusion. An intravenous line should be placed and blood drawn for serum glucose and other routine determinations.

At this point, every patient with altered mental status should receive a challenge with concentrated dextrose, unless a rapid bedside blood glucose test demonstrates that the patient is not hypoglycemic. Adults are given 25 g ( 50 mL of $50 \%$ dextrose solution) intravenously, children $0.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ ( $2 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ of $25 \%$ dextrose). Hypoglycemic patients may appear to be intoxicated, and there is no rapid and reliable way to distinguish them from poisoned patients. Alcoholic or malnourished patients should also receive 100 mg of thiamine intramuscularly or in the intravenous infusion solution at this time to prevent Wernicke's syndrome.

The opioid antagonist naloxone may be given in a dose of $0.4-2 \mathrm{mg}$ intravenously. Naloxone will
reverse respiratory and CNS depression due to all varieties of opioid drugs (see Chapter 31). It is useful to remember that these drugs cause death primarily by respiratory depression; therefore, if airway and breathing assistance have already been instituted, naloxone may not be necessary. Larger doses of naloxone may be needed for patients with overdose involving propoxyphene, codeine, and some other opioids. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (see Chapter 22) may be of value in patients with suspected benzodiazepine overdose, but it should not be used if there is a history of tricyclic antidepressant overdose or a seizure disorder, as it can induce convulsions in such patients.

\section*{History \& Physical Examination}

Once the essential initial ABCD interventions have been instituted, one can begin a more detailed evaluation to make a specific diagnosis. This includes gathering any available history and performing a toxicologically oriented physical examination. Other causes of coma or seizures such as head trauma, meningitis, or metabolic abnormalities should be looked for and treated. Some common toxic syndromes are described in the section Common Toxic Syndromes.

\section*{HISTORY}

Oral statements about the amount and even the type of drug ingested in toxic emergencies may be unreliable. Even so, family members, police, and fire department or paramedical personnel should be asked to describe the environment in which the toxic emergency occurred and should bring to the emergency department any syringes, empty bottles, household products, or over-the-counter medications in the immediate vicinity of the possibly poisoned patient.

\section*{PHYSICAL EXAMI NATION}

A brief examination should be performed, emphasizing those areas most likely to give clues to the toxicologic diagnosis. These include vital signs, eyes and mouth, skin, abdomen, and nervous system.

\section*{Vital Signs}

Careful evaluation of vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respirations, and temperature) is essential in all toxicologic emergencies. Hypertension and tachycardia are typical with amphetamines, cocaine, and antimuscarinic (anticholinergic) drugs. Hypotension and bardycardia are characteristic features of overdose with calcium channel blockers, Bblockers, clonidine, and sedative hypnotics. Hypotension with tachycardia is common with tricyclic antidepressants, trazodone, quetiapine, vasodilators, and $B$ agonists. Rapid respirations are typical of salicylates, carbon monoxide, and other toxins that produce metabolic acidosis or cellular asphyxia. Hyperthermia may be associated with sympathomimetics, anticholinergics, salicylates, and drugs producing seizures or muscular rigidity. Hypothermia can be caused by any CNS-depressant drug, especially when accompanied by exposure to a cold environment.

\section*{Eyes}

The eyes are a valuable source of toxicologic information. Constriction of the pupils (miosis) is typical of opioids, clonidine, phenothiazines, and cholinesterase inhibitors (eg, organophosphate insecticides), and deep coma due to sedative drugs. Dilation of the pupils (mydriasis) is common with amphetamines, cocaine, LSD, and atropine and other anticholinergic drugs. Horizontal nystagmus is characteristic of intoxication with phenytoin, alcohol, barbiturates, and other sedative drugs. The presence of both vertical and horizontal nystagmus is strongly suggestive of phencyclidine poisoning. Ptosis and ophthalmoplegia are characteristic features of botulism.

\section*{Mouth}

The mouth may show signs of burns due to corrosive substances, or soot from smoke inhalation. Typical odors of alcohol, hydrocarbon solvents, or ammonia may be noted. Poisoning due to cyanide can be recognized by some examiners as an odor like bitter almonds.

\section*{Skin}

The skin often appears flushed, hot, and dry in poisoning with atropine and other antimuscarinics. Excessive sweating occurs with organophosphates, nicotine, and sympathomimetic drugs. Cyanosis may be caused by hypoxemia or by methemoglobinemia. I cterus may suggest hepatic necrosis due to acetaminophen or Amanita phalloides mushroom poisoning.

\section*{Abdomen}

Abdominal examination may reveal ileus, which is typical of poisoning with antimuscarinic, opioid, and sedative drugs. Hyperactive bowel sounds, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea are common in poisoning with organophosphates, iron, arsenic, theophylline, A phalloides, and A muscaria.

\section*{Nervous System}

A careful neurologic examination is essential. Focal seizures or motor deficits suggest a structural lesion (such as intracranial hemorrhage due to trauma) rather than toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. Nystagmus, dysarthria, and ataxia are typical of phenytoin, carbamazepine, alcohol, and other sedative intoxication. Twitching and muscular hyperactivity are common with atropine and other anticholinergic agents, and cocaine and other sympathomimetic drugs. Muscular rigidity can be caused by haloperidol and other antipsychotic agents, serotonin syndrome, and by strychnine. Seizures are often caused by overdose with antidepressants (especially tricyclic antidepressants and bupropion), cocaine, amphetamines, theophylline, isoniazid, and diphenhydramine. Flaccid coma with absent reflexes and even an isoelectric electroencephalogram may be seen with deep coma due to sedativehypnotic or other CNS depressant intoxication and may be mistaken for brain death.

\section*{Laboratory \& I maging Procedures}

\section*{ARTERIAL BLOOD GASES}

Hypoventilation will result in an elevated PCO2 (hypercapnia) and a low PO2 (hypoxia). The Po2 may also be low with aspiration pneumonia or drug-induced pulmonary edema. Poor tissue oxygenation due to hypoxia, hypotension, or cyanide poisoning will result in metabolic acidosis. The Po2 measures only oxygen dissolved in the plasma and not total blood oxygen content or oxyhemoglobin saturation, and may appear normal in patients with severe carbon monoxide poisoning. Pulse oximetry may also give falsely normal results in carbon monoxide intoxication.

\section*{ELECTROLYTES}

Sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate should be measured. The anion gap is then calculated by subtracting the measured anions from cations:
$$\text { Anion gap }=\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{K}^{+}\right)-\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right)$$

Normally the sum of the cations exceeds the sum of the anions by no more than $12-16 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. A larger-than-expected anion gap is caused by the presence of unmeasured anions (lactate, etc) accompanying metabolic acidosis. This may occur with numerous conditions, such as diabetic ketoacidosis, renal failure, or shock-induced lactic acidosis. Drugs that may induce an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis (Table 59-1) include aspirin, metformin, methanol, ethylene glycol, isoniazid,
and iron.
Table 59-1. Examples of Drug-I nduced Anion Gap Acidosis.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Type of Elevation of the Anion Gap & Agents \\
\hline Organic acid metabolites & Methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol \\
\hline Lactic acidosis & Cyanide, carbon monoxide, ibuprofen, isoniazid, metformin, salicylates, valproic acid; any drug-induced seizures, hypoxia, or hypotension \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Note: The normal anion gap calculated from $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{K}^{+}\right)-\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right)$is $12-16 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$; calculated from $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right)-\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right)$, it is $8-12 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$.

Alterations in the serum potassium level are hazardous because they can result in cardiac arrhythmias. Drugs that may cause hyperkalemia despite normal renal function include potassium itself, Bblockers, digitalis glycosides, potassium-sparing diuretics, and fluoride. Drugs associated with hypokalemia include barium, Bagonists, caffeine, theophylline, and thiazide and loop diuretics.

\section*{RENAL FUNCTION TESTS}

Some toxins have direct nephrotoxic effects; in other cases, renal failure is due to shock or myoglobinuria. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels should be measured and urinalysis performed. Elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin in the urine suggest muscle necrosis due to seizures or muscular rigidity. Oxalate crystals in the urine suggest ethylene glycol poisoning.

\section*{SERUM OSMOLALITY}

The calculated serum osmolality is dependent mainly on the serum sodium and glucose and the blood urea nitrogen and can be estimated from the following formula:
$$2 \times \mathrm{Na}^{+}(\mathrm{meq} / \mathrm{L})+\frac{\text { Glucose }(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})}{18}+\frac{\text { BUN }(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})}{3}$$

This calculated value is normally 280-290 mOsm/L. Ethanol and other alcohols may contribute significantly to the measured serum osmolality but, since they are not included in the calculation, cause an osmolar gap:
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Osmolar } \\
& \text { gap }
\end{aligned}=\begin{aligned}
& \text { Measured } \\
& \text { osmolality }
\end{aligned} \text { - Calculated }$$

Table 59-2 lists the concentration and expected contribution to the serum osmolality in ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropanol poisonings.

Table 59-2. Some Substances that Cause an Osmolar Gap.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Substance ${ }^{1}$ & Serum Level (mg/ dL) & Corresponding Osmolar Gap (mOsm/ kg) \\
\hline Ethanol & 350 & 75 \\
\hline Methanol & 80 & 25 \\
\hline Ethylene glycol & 200 & 35 \\
\hline Isopropanol & 350 & 60 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
${ }^{1}$ Other substances that can increase the osmolar gap include acetone, mannitol, and magnesium.
Note: Most laboratories use the freezing point method of determining osmolality. However, if the vaporization point method is used, the alcohols may be driven off and their contribution to osmolality will be lost.

\section*{ELECTROCARDI OGRAM}

Widening of the QRS complex duration to greater than 100 milliseconds is typical of tricyclic antidepressant and quinidine overdoses (Figure 59-1). The $\mathrm{QT}_{\mathrm{c}}$ interval may be prolonged to more than 440 milliseconds in many poisonings, including quinidine, tricyclic antidepressants, several newer antidepressants and antipsychotics, lithium, and arsenic (see also http://www.torsades.org/). Variable atrioventricular (AV) block and a variety of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias are common with poisoning by digoxin and other cardiac glycosides. Hypoxemia due to carbon monoxide poisoning may result in ischemic changes on the electrocardiogram.

\section*{IMAGING FINDINGS}

A plain film of the abdomen may be useful because some tablets, particularly iron and potassium, may be radiopaque. Chest radiographs may reveal aspiration pneumonia, hydrocarbon pneumonia, or pulmonary edema. When head trauma is suspected, a computed tomography (CT) scan is recommended.

\section*{Toxicology Screening Tests}

It is a common misconception that a broad toxicology "screen" is the best way to diagnose and manage an acute poisoning. In fact, comprehensive toxicology screening is time-consuming, expensive, and often unreliable. Results of tests may not be available for days. Moreover, many highly toxic drugs such as calcium channel blockers, Bblockers, and isoniazid are not included in the screening process. The clinical examination of the patient and selected routine laboratory tests are usually sufficient to generate a tentative diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan. While screening tests may be helpful in confirming a suspected intoxication or for ruling out intoxication as a cause of apparent brain death, they should not delay needed treatment.

When a specific antidote or other treatment is under consideration, quantitative laboratory testing may be indicated. For example, determination of the acetaminophen serum level is useful in assessing the need for antidotal therapy with acetylcysteine. Serum levels of theophylline, carbamazepine, lithium, salicylates, valproic acid, and other drugs may indicate the need for hemodialysis (Table 59-3).

\section*{Decontamination}

Decontamination procedures should be undertaken simultaneously with initial stabilization, diagnostic
assessment, and laboratory evaluation. Decontamination involves removing toxins from the skin or gastrointestinal tract.

\section*{SKI N}

Contaminated clothing should be completely removed and double-bagged to prevent illness in health care providers and for possible laboratory analysis. Wash contaminated skin with soap and water.

\section*{GASTROI NTESTI NAL TRACT}

Controversy remains regarding the efficacy of gut emptying by emesis or gastric lavage, especially when treatment is initiated more than 1 hour after ingestion. For most ingestions, clinical toxicologists recommend simple administration of activated charcoal to bind ingested poisons in the gut before they can be absorbed. In unusual circumstances, induced emesis or gastric lavage may also be used.

\section*{Emesis}

Emesis can be induced with ipecac syrup (never extract of ipecac), and this method is sometimes used to treat childhood ingestions at home under telephone supervision of a physician or poison control center personnel. I pecac should not be used if the suspected intoxicant is a corrosive agent, a petroleum distillate, or a rapidly acting convulsant. Previously popular methods of inducing emesis such as fingertip stimulation of the pharynx, salt water, and apomorphine are ineffective or dangerous and should not be used.

\section*{Gastric Lavage}

If the patient is awake or if the airway is protected by an endotracheal tube, gastric lavage may be performed using an orogastric or nasogastric tube. As large a tube as possible should be used. Lavage solutions (usually $0.9 \%$ saline) should be at body temperature to prevent hypothermia.

\section*{Activated Charcoal}

Owing to its large surface area, activated charcoal can adsorb many drugs and poisons. It is most effective if given in a ratio of at least 10:1 of charcoal to estimated dose of toxin by weight. Charcoal does not bind iron, lithium, or potassium, and it binds alcohols and cyanide only poorly. It does not appear to be useful in poisoning due to corrosive mineral acids and alkali. Recent studies suggest that oral activated charcoal given alone may be just as effective as gut emptying followed by charcoal. Also, other studies have shown that repeated doses of oral activated charcoal may enhance systemic elimination of some drugs (including carbamazepine, dapsone, and theophylline) by a mechanism referred to as "gut dialysis."

\section*{Cathartics}

Administration of a cathartic (laxative) agent may hasten removal of toxins from the gastrointestinal tract and reduce absorption, although no controlled studies have been done. Whole bowel irrigation with a balanced polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution (GoLYTELY, CoLyte) can enhance gut decontamination after ingestion of iron tablets, enteric-coated medicines, illicit drug-filled packets, and foreign bodies. The solution is administered at $1-2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{h}$ ( $500 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$ in children) for several hours until the rectal effluent is clear.

\section*{Specific Antidotes}

There is a popular misconception that there is an antidote for every poison. Actually, selective antidotes are available for only a few classes of toxins. The major antidotes and their characteristics are listed in Table 59-4.

Table 59-4. Examples of Specific Antidotes.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Antidote & Poison(s) & Comments \\
\hline Acetylcysteine (Acetabate, Mucomyst) & Acetaminophen & Best results if given within 8-10 hours of overdose. Follow liver function tests and acetaminophen blood levels. Acetabate is given intravenously; Mucomyst, orally. \\
\hline Atropine & Anticholinesterases: organophosphates, carbamates & A test dose of $1-2 \mathrm{mg}$ (for children, $0.05 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) is given IV and repeated until symptoms of atropinism appear (tachycardia, dilated pupils, ileus). Dose may be doubled every 10-15 minutes, with decrease of secretions as therapeutic end point. \\
\hline Bicarbonate, sodium & Membrane-depressant cardiotoxic drugs (tricyclic antidepressants, quinidine, etc) & 1-2 mEq/kg IV bolus usually reverses cardiotoxic effects (wide QRS, hypotension). Give cautiously in heart failure (avoid sodium overload). \\
\hline Calcium & Fluoride; calcium channel blockers & Large doses may be needed in severe calcium channel blocker overdose. Start with $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV. \\
\hline Deferoxamine & Iron salts & If poisoning is severe, give $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h}$ IV. Urine may become pink. 100 mg of deferoxamine binds 8.5 mg of iron. \\
\hline Digoxin antibodies & Digoxin and related cardiac glycosides & One vial binds 0.5 mg digoxin; indications include serious arrhythmias, hyperkalemia. \\
\hline Esmolol & Theophylline, caffeine, metaproterenol & Short-acting Bblocker reverses B ${ }_{1}$-induced tachycardia and (possibly) $B_{2}$-induced vasodilation. Infuse $25-50 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ IV. \\
\hline Ethanol & Methanol, ethylene glycol & Ethanol therapy can be started before laboratory diagnosis is confirmed. A loading dose is calculated so as to give a blood level of at least $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( 42 g/70 kg in adults). \\
\hline Flumazenil & Benzodiazepines & Adult dose is 0.2 mg IV, repeated as necessary to a maximum of 3 mg . Do not give to patients with seizures, benzodiazepine dependence, or tricyclic overdose. \\
\hline Fomepizole & Methanol, ethylene glycol & More convenient and easier to use than ethanol. Loading dose $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$; repeat every 12 hours. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Antidote & Poison(s) & Comments \\
\hline Glucagon & Bblockers & $5-10 \mathrm{mg}$ IV bolus may reverse hypotension and bradycardia that was resistant to $B$-agonist drugs. May cause vomiting. \\
\hline Naloxone & Narcotic drugs, other opioid derivatives & A specific antagonist of opioids; $1-2 \mathrm{mg}$ initially by IV, IM, or subcutaneous injection. Larger doses may be needed to reverse the effects of overdose with propoxyphene, codeine, or fentanyl derivatives. Duration of action (2-3 hours) may be significantly shorter than that of the opioid being antagonized. \\
\hline Oxygen & Carbon monoxide & Give 100\% by high-flow nonrebreathing mask; use of hyperbaric chamber is controversial. \\
\hline Physostigmine & Suggested for antimuscarinic anticholinergic agents; not for tricyclic antidepressants & Adult dose is $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg}$ IV slowly. The effects are transient (30-60 minutes), and the lowest effective dose may be repeated when symptoms return. May cause bradycardia, increased bronchial secretions, seizures. Have atropine ready to reverse excess effects. Do not use for tricyclic antidepressant overdose. \\
\hline Pralidoxime (2PAM) & Organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitors & Adult dose is 1 g IV , which should be repeated every 3-4 hours as needed or preferably as a constant infusion of $250-400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{h}$. Pediatric dose is approximately 250 mg . No proved benefit in carbamate poisoning. \\

\end{tabular}

\section*{Methods of Enhancing Elimination of Toxins}

After appropriate diagnostic and decontamination procedures and administration of antidotes, it is important to consider whether measures for enhancing elimination, such as hemodialysis or urinary alkalinization, can improve clinical outcome. Table 59-3 lists intoxications for which dialysis may be beneficial.

\section*{DIALYSIS PROCEDURES}

\section*{Peritoneal Dialysis}

This is a relatively simple and available technique but is inefficient in removing most drugs.

\section*{Hemodialysis}

Hemodialysis is more efficient than peritoneal dialysis and has been well studied. It assists in correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance and may also enhance removal of toxic metabolites (eg, formate in methanol poisoning, oxalate and glycolate in ethylene glycol poisoning). The efficiency of both peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis is a function of the molecular weight, water solubility, protein binding, endogenous clearance, and distribution in the body of the specific toxin. Hemodialysis is especially useful in overdose cases in which the precipitating drug can be removed and fluid and electrolyte imbalances are present and can be corrected (eg, salicylate intoxication).

\section*{FORCED DIURESIS AND URINARY PH MANIPULATION}

Previously popular but of unproved value, forced diuresis may cause volume overload and electrolyte abnormalities and is not recommended. Renal elimination of a few toxins can be enhanced by alteration of urinary pH. For example, urinary alkalinization is useful in cases of salicylate overdose. Acidification may increase the urine concentration of drugs such as phencyclidine and amphetamines but is not advised because it may worsen renal complications from rhabdomyolysis, which often accompanies the intoxication.

\section*{COMMON TOXI C SYNDROMES}

\section*{ACETAMI NOPHEN}

Acetaminophen is one of the drugs most commonly involved in suicide attempts and accidental poisonings, both as the sole agent and in combination with other drugs. Acute ingestion of more than $150-200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ (children) or 7 g total (adults) is considered potentially toxic. A highly toxic metabolite is produced in the liver (see Figure 4-4).

Initially, the patient is asymptomatic or has mild gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting). After 24-36 hours, evidence of liver injury appears, with elevated aminotransferase levels and hypoprothrombinemia. In severe cases, fulminant liver failure occurs, leading to hepatic encephalopathy and death. Renal failure may also occur.

The severity of poisoning is estimated from a serum acetaminophen concentration measurement. If the level is greater than $150-200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ approximately 4 hours after ingestion, the patient is at risk for liver injury. (Chronic alcoholics or patients taking drugs that enhance P450 production of toxic metabolites are at risk with lower levels, perhaps as low as $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ at 4 hours.) The antidote acetylcysteine acts as a glutathione substitute, binding the toxic metabolite as it is being produced. It is most effective when given early and should be started within 8-10 hours if possible. A liver transplant may be required for patients with fulminant hepatic failure.

\section*{AMPHETAMI NES \& OTHER STI MULANTS}

Stimulant drugs commonly abused in the USA include methamphetamine ("crank," "crystal"), methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, "ecstasy"), and cocaine ("crack") as well as legal substances such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) and ephedrine (as such and in the herbal agent Mahuang) (see Chapter 32). Caffeine is often added to dietary supplements sold as "metabolic enhancers" or "fat-burners" and is also sometimes combined with pseudoephedrine in underground pills sold as amphetamine substitutes.

At the doses usually used by stimulant abusers, euphoria and wakefulness are accompanied by a sense of power and well-being. At higher doses, restlessness, agitation, and acute psychosis may occur, accompanied by hypertension and tachycardia. Prolonged muscular hyperactivity can cause dehydration and eventually, hypotension. Seizures and muscle activity may contribute to hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis. Body temperatures as high as $42^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ have been recorded. Hyperthermia can cause brain damage, hypotension, coagulopathy, and renal failure.

Treatment includes general supportive measures as outlined earlier. There is no specific antidote. Seizures and hyperthermia are the most dangerous manifestations and must be treated aggressively.

Seizures are usually managed with intravenous benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam). Temperature is reduced by removing clothing, spraying with tepid water, and encouraging evaporative cooling with fanning. For very high body temperatures (eg, $>40-41^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ), neuromuscular paralysis is used to abolish muscle activity quickly.

\section*{ANTI CHOLI NERGI C AGENTS}

A large number of prescription and nonprescription drugs, as well as a variety of plants and mushrooms, can inhibit the effects of acetylcholine. Many drugs used for other purposes (eg, antihistamines) also have anticholinergic effects. Many of them have other potentially toxic actions as well-eg, antihistamines such as diphenhydramine can cause seizures; tricyclic antidepressants, which have anticholinergic, quinidine-like, and a-blocking effects, can cause severe cardiovascular toxicity.

The classic anticholinergic syndrome is remembered as "red as a beet" (skin flushed), "hot as a hare" (hyperthermia), "dry as a bone" (dry mucous membranes, no sweating), "blind as a bat" (blurred vision, cycloplegia), and "mad as a hatter" (confusion, delirium). Patients usually have sinus tachycardia, and the pupils are usually dilated (see Chapter 8). Agitated delirium or coma may be present. Muscle twitching is common, but seizures are unusual unless the patient has ingested an antihistamine or a tricyclic antidepressant. Urinary retention is common, especially in older men.

Treatment is largely supportive. Agitated patients may require sedation with a benzodiazepine or an antipsychotic agent (eg, haloperidol). The specific antidote for peripheral and central anticholinergic syndrome is physostigmine, which has a prompt and dramatic effect and is especially useful for patients who are very agitated. It is given in small intravenous doses ( $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg}$ ), with careful monitoring, because it can cause bradycardia and seizures if given too rapidly. Physostigmine should not be given to a patient with suspected tricyclic antidepressant overdose because it can aggravate cardiotoxicity, resulting in heart block or asystole. Catheterization may be needed to prevent excessive distention of the bladder.

\section*{ANTI DEPRESSANTS}

Tricyclic antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin, many others; see Chapter 30) are among the most common prescription drugs involved in life-threatening drug overdose. Ingestion of more than 1 g of a tricyclic (or about $15-20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) is considered potentially lethal.

Tricyclic antidepressants are competitive antagonists at muscarinic cholinergic receptors, and anticholinergic findings (tachycardia, dilated pupils, dry mouth) are common even at moderate doses. Some tricyclics are also strong ablockers, which can lead to vasodilation. Centrally mediated agitation and seizures may be followed by depression and hypotension. Most importantly, the tricyclics have quinidine-like depressant effects that cause slowed conduction with a wide QRS interval and depressed cardiac contractility. This cardiac toxicity may result in serious arrhythmias (Figure 59-1), including ventricular conduction block and ventricular tachycardia.

Treatment of tricyclic antidepressant overdose includes general supportive care as outlined earlier. Endotracheal intubation and assisted ventilation may be needed. Intravenous fluids are given for hypotension, and dopamine or norepinephrine is added if necessary. Many toxicologists recommend norepinephrine as the initial drug of choice for tricyclic-induced hypotension. The antidote for quinidine-like cardiac toxicity (manifested by a wide QRS complex) is sodium bicarbonate: a bolus of
$50-100 \mathrm{mEq}$ ( or 1-2 mEq/ kg) provides a rapid increase in extracellular sodium that helps overcome sodium channel blockade. Do not use physostigmine! Although this agent does effectively reverse anticholinergic symptoms, it can aggravate depression of cardiac conduction and can cause seizures.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (eg, tranylcypromine, phenelzine) are a group of older antidepressants that are occasionally used for resistant depression. They can cause severe hypertensive reactions when interacting foods or drugs are taken (see Chapter 9); and they can interact with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

Newer antidepressants (eg, fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, venlafaxine) are mostly SSRIs and are generally safer than the tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, although they can cause seizures. Bupropion (not an SSRI) has caused seizures even in therapeutic doses. Some antidepressants have been associated with QT prolongation and torsade de pointes arrhythmia. The SSRIs may interact with each other or especially with monoamine oxidase inhibitors to cause the serotonin syndrome, characterized by agitation, muscle hyperactivity, and hyperthermia (see Chapter 16).

\section*{ANTI PSYCHOTI CS}

Antipsychotic drugs include the older phenothiazines and butyrophenones, as well as newer atypical drugs. All of these can cause CNS depression, seizures, and hypotension. Some can cause QT prolongation. The potent dopamine $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ blockers are also associated with parkinsonian-like movement disorders (dystonic reactions) and in rare cases with the neuroleptic malignant syndrome, characterized by "lead-pipe" rigidity, hyperthermia, and autonomic instability (see Chapters 16 and 29).

\section*{ASPIRIN (SALI CYLATE)}

Salicylate poisoning (see Chapter 36) is a much less common cause of childhood poisoning deaths since the introduction of child-resistant containers and the reduced use of children's aspirin. It still accounts for numerous suicidal and accidental poisonings. Acute ingestion of more than $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ is likely to produce intoxication. Poisoning can also result from chronic overmedication; this occurs most commonly in elderly patients using salicylates for chronic pain who become confused about their dosing. Poisoning causes uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and disruption of normal cellular metabolism.

The first sign of salicylate toxicity is often hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis due to medullary stimulation (Figure 59-2). Metabolic acidosis follows, and an increased anion gap results from accumulation of lactate as well as excretion of bicarbonate by the kidney to compensate for respiratory alkalosis. Arterial blood gas testing often reveals this mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. Body temperature may be elevated due to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Severe hyperthermia may occur in serious cases. Vomiting and hyperpnea as well as hyperthermia contribute to fluid loss and dehydration. With very severe poisoning, profound metabolic acidosis, seizures, coma, pulmonary edema, and cardiovascular collapse may occur. Absorption of salicylate and signs of toxicity may be delayed after very large overdoses or ingestion of enteric-coated tablets.

\section*{Figure 59-2.}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-1755.jpg?height=1427&width=1657&top_left_y=346&top_left_x=223)

General supportive care as described earlier is essential. After massive aspirin ingestions (eg, more than 100 tablets), aggressive gut decontamination is advisable, including gastric lavage, repeated doses of activated charcoal, and consideration of whole bowel irrigation. Intravenous fluids are used to replace fluid losses caused by tachypnea, vomiting, and fever. For moderate intoxications, intravenous sodium bicarbonate is given to alkalinize the urine and promote salicylate excretion by trapping the salicylate in its ionized, polar form. For severe poisoning (eg, patients with severe acidosis, coma, and serum salicylate level > $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), emergency hemodialysis is performed to remove the salicylate more quickly and restore acid-base balance and fluid status.

\section*{BETA BLOCKERS}

In overdose, these drugs block both $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ adrenoceptors; that is, selectivity, if any, is lost at high dosage. The most toxic Bblocker is propranolol. As little as two to three times the therapeutic dose can
cause serious toxicity. This may be because propranolol has additional properties: At high doses it may cause sodium channel blocking effects similar to those seen with quinidine-like drugs, and it is lipophilic, allowing it to enter the CNS (see Chapter 10).

Bradycardia and hypotension are the most common manifestations of toxicity. Agents with partial agonist activity (eg, pindolol) can cause tachycardia and hypertension. Seizures and cardiac conduction block (wide QRS complex) may be seen with propranolol overdose.

General supportive care should be provided as outlined earlier. The usual measures used to raise the blood pressure and heart rate, such as intravenous fluids, $B$-agonist drugs, and atropine, are generally ineffective. Glucagon is a useful antidote that-like Bagonists-acts on cardiac cells to raise intracellular cAMP but does so through stimulation of glucagon receptors rather than Badrenoceptors. It can improve heart rate and blood pressure when given in high doses ( $5-20 \mathrm{mg}$ intravenously).

\section*{CALCI UM CHANNEL BLOCKERS}

Calcium antagonists can cause serious toxicity or death with relatively small overdoses. These channel blockers depress sinus node automaticity and slow AV node conduction (see Chapter 12). They also reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Serious hypotension is mainly seen with nifedipine and related dihydropyridines, but in severe overdose all of the listed cardiovascular effects can occur with any of the calcium channel blockers.

Treatment requires general supportive care as outlined earlier. Since most ingested calcium antagonists are in a sustained-release form, it may be possible to expel them before they are completely absorbed; initiate whole bowel irrigation and oral activated charcoal as soon as possible, before calcium antagonist-induced ileus intervenes. Calcium, given intravenously in doses of $2-10 \mathrm{~g}$, is a useful antidote for depressed cardiac contractility but less effective for nodal block or peripheral vascular collapse. Other drugs reported to be helpful in managing hypotension associated with calcium channel blocker poisoning include glucagon, vasopressin, epinephrine, and high-dose insulin plus glucose supplementation to maintain euglycemia.

\section*{CARBON MONOXI DE \& OTHER TOXI C GASES}

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that is ubiquitous because it is created whenever carbon-containing materials are burned (see Table 57-1). Carbon monoxide poisoning is the leading cause of death due to poisoning in the USA. Most cases occur in victims of fires, but accidental and suicidal exposures are also common. Diagnosis and treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning are described in Chapter 57. Many other toxic gases are produced in fires or released in industrial accidents (Table 59-5).

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}

\end{tabular}

\section*{CHOLI NESTERASE I NHI BITORS}

Organophosphate and carbamate cholinesterase inhibitors (see Chapter 7) are widely used to kill insects and other pests. Most cases of serious organophosphate or carbamate poisoning result from intentional ingestion by a suicidal person, but poisoning has also occurred at work (pesticide application or packaging) or, rarely, as a result of food contamination or terrorist attack (eg, release of the chemical warfare nerve agent sarin in the Tokyo subway system in 1995).

Stimulation of muscarinic receptors causes abdominal cramps, diarrhea, excessive salivation, sweating, urinary frequency, and increased bronchial secretions (see Chapters 6 and 7). Stimulation of nicotinic receptors causes generalized ganglionic activation, which can lead to hypertension and either tachycardia or bradycardia. Muscle twitching and fasciculations may progress to weakness and respiratory muscle paralysis. CNS effects include agitation, confusion, and seizures. The mnemonic DUMBELS (diarrhea, urination, miosis and muscle weakness, bronchospasm, excitation, lacrimation,
and seizures, sweating, and salivation) helps recall the common findings. Blood testing may be used to document depressed activity of red blood cell (acetylcholinesterase) and plasma (butyrylcholinesterase) enzymes, which provide an indirect estimate of synaptic cholinesterase activity.

General supportive care should be provided as outlined above. Extra precautions should be taken to ensure that rescuers and health care providers are not poisoned by exposure to contaminated clothing or skin. This is especially critical for the most potent substances such as parathion or nerve gas agents. Antidotal treatment consists of atropine and pralidoxime (see Chapter 8). Atropine is an effective competitive inhibitor at muscarinic sites but has no effect at nicotinic sites. Pralidoxime given early enough is capable of restoring the cholinesterase activity and is active at both muscarinic and nicotinic sites.

\section*{DIGOXI N}

Digitalis and other cardiac glycosides are found in many plants (see Chapter 13) and in the skin of some toads. Toxicity may occur as a result of acute overdose or from accumulation of digoxin in a patient with renal insufficiency or one taking a drug that interferes with digoxin elimination. Patients receiving long-term digoxin treatment are often also taking diuretics, which can lead to electrolyte depletion (especially potassium).

Vomiting is common in patients with digitalis overdose. Hyperkalemia may be caused by acute digitalis overdose or severe poisoning, while hypokalemia may be present in patients as a result of long-term diuretic treatment. (Digitalis does not cause hypokalemia.) A variety of cardiac rhythm disturbances may occur, including sinus bradycardia, AV block, atrial tachycardia with block, accelerated junctional rhythm, premature ventricular beats, bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, and other ventricular arrhythmias.

General supportive care should be provided as outlined earlier. Atropine is often effective for bradycardia or AV block. The use of digoxin antibodies (see Chapter 13) has revolutionized the treatment of digoxin toxicity; they should be administered intravenously in the dosage indicated in the package insert. Symptoms usually improve within 30-60 minutes after antibody administration. Digoxin antibodies may also be tried in cases of poisoning by other cardiac glycosides (eg, digitoxin, oleander), although larger doses may be needed due to incomplete cross-reactivity.

\section*{ETHANOL \& SEDATI VE-HYPNOTI C DRUGS}

Overdosage with ethanol and sedative-hypnotic drugs (eg, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, $\gamma^{\prime}$ hydroxybutyrate [GHB], carisoprodol [Soma]; see Chapters 22 and 23) occurs frequently because of their common availability and use.

Patients with ethanol or sedative-hypnotic overdose may be euphoric and rowdy ("drunk") or in a state of stupor or coma ("dead drunk"). Comatose patients often have depressed respiratory drive. Depression of protective airway reflexes may result in aspiration of gastric contents. Hypothermia may be present because of environmental exposure and depressed shivering. Ethanol blood levels greater than $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ usually cause deep coma, but regular users are often tolerant to the effects of ethanol and may be ambulatory despite even higher levels. Patients with GHB overdose are often deeply comatose for 3-4 hours and then awaken fully in a matter of minutes.

General supportive care should be provided. With careful attention to protecting the airway (including
endotracheal intubation) and assisting ventilation, most patients will recover as the drug effects wear off. Hypotension usually responds to body warming if cold, intravenous fluids and, if needed, dopamine. Patients with isolated benzodiazepine overdose may awaken after intravenous flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. However, this drug is not widely used as empiric therapy for drug overdose because it may precipitate seizures in patients who are addicted to benzodiazepines or who have ingested a convulsant drug (eg, a tricyclic antidepressant). There are no antidotes for ethanol, barbiturates, or most other sedative-hypnotics.

\section*{ETHYLENE GLYCOL \& METHANOL}

These alcohols are important toxins because of their metabolism to highly toxic organic acids (see Chapter 23). They are capable of causing CNS depression and a drunken state similar to ethanol overdose. However, their products of metabolism-formic acid (from methanol) or hippuric, oxalic, and glycolic acids (from ethylene glycol)-cause a severe metabolic acidosis and can lead to coma and blindness (in the case of formic acid) or renal failure (from oxalic acid and glycolic acid). Initially, the patient appears drunk, but after a delay of up to several hours, a severe anion gap metabolic acidosis becomes apparent, accompanied by hyperventilation and altered mental status. Patients with methanol poisoning may have visual disturbances ranging from blurred vision to blindness.

Metabolism of ethylene glycol and methanol to their toxic products can be blocked by inhibiting the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase with a competing drug. Ethanol is metabolized preferentially by alcohol dehydrogenase, so ethanol can be given orally or intravenously (5\% pharmaceutical grade) to a level of approximately $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Alternatively, the antidote fomepizole-an effective blocker of alcohol dehydrogenase that does not induce ethanol intoxication-can be used.

\section*{I RON \& OTHER METALS}

Iron is widely used in over-the-counter vitamin preparations and is a leading cause of childhood poisoning deaths. As few as 10-12 prenatal multivitamins with iron may cause serious illness in a small child. Poisoning with other metals (lead, mercury, arsenic) is also important, especially in industry. See Chapters 33 and 58 for detailed discussions of poisoning by iron and other metals.

\section*{OPIOIDS}

Opioids (opium, morphine, heroin, meperidine, methadone, etc) are common drugs of abuse (see Chapters 31 and 32), and overdose is a frequent result of using the poorly standardized preparations sold on the street. See Chapter 31 for a detailed discussion of opioid overdose and its treatment.

\section*{RATTLESNAKE ENVENOMATION}

In the USA, rattlesnakes are the most common venomous reptiles. Bites are rarely fatal, and $20 \%$ do not involve envenomation. However, about 60\% of bites cause significant morbidity due to the destructive digestive enzymes found in the venom. Evidence of rattlesnake envenomation includes severe pain, swelling, bruising, hemorrhagic bleb formation, and obvious fang marks. Systemic effects include nausea, vomiting, muscle fasciculations, tingling and metallic taste in the mouth, shock, and systemic coagulopathy with prolonged clotting time and reduced platelet count.

Studies have shown that emergency field remedies such as incision and suction, tourniquets, and ice packs are far more damaging than useful. Avoidance of unnecessary motion, on the other hand, does help to limit the spread of the venom. Definitive therapy relies on intravenous antivenin and should be
started as soon as possible.

\section*{THEOPHYLLI NE}

Although it has been largely replaced by inhaled Bagonists, theophylline continues to be used for the treatment of bronchospasm by some patients with asthma and bronchitis (see Chapter 20). A dose of 20-30 tablets can cause serious or fatal poisoning. Chronic or subacute theophylline poisoning can also occur as a result of accidental overmedication or use of a drug that interferes with theophylline metabolism (eg, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin; see Chapter 4).

In addition to sinus tachycardia and tremor, vomiting is common after overdose. Hypotension, tachycardia, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia may occur, probably due to $B_{2}$-adrenergic activation. The cause of this activation is not fully understood, but the effects can be ameliorated by the use of $B$ blockers (see below). Cardiac arrhythmias include atrial tachycardias, premature ventricular contractions, and ventricular tachycardia. In severe poisoning (eg, acute overdose with serum level > $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ ), seizures often occur and are usually resistant to common anticonvulsants. Toxicity may be delayed in onset for many hours after ingestion of sustained-release tablet formulations.

General supportive care should be provided. Aggressive gut decontamination should be carried out using repeated doses of activated charcoal and whole bowel irrigation. Propranolol or other Bblockers (eg, esmolol) are useful antidotes for B-mediated hypotension and tachycardia. Phenobarbital is preferred over phenytoin for convulsions; most anticonvulsants are ineffective. Hemodialysis is indicated for serum concentrations greater than $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ and for intractable seizures in patients with lower levels.

\section*{SPECI AL ASPECTS OF PERI NATAL \& PEDI ATRI C PHARMACOLOGY: I NTRODUCTI ON}

The effects of drugs on the fetus and newborn infant are based on the general principles set forth in Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this book. However, the physiologic contexts in which these pharmacologic laws operate are different in pregnant women and in rapidly maturing infants. At present, the special pharmacokinetic factors operative in these patients are beginning to be understood, whereas information regarding pharmacodynamic differences (eg, receptor characteristics and responses) is still incomplete.

\section*{DRUG THERAPY IN PREGNANCY}

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Most drugs taken by pregnant women can cross the placenta and expose the developing embryo and fetus to their pharmacologic and teratogenic effects. Critical factors affecting placental drug transfer and drug effects on the fetus include the following: (1) the physicochemical properties of the drug; (2) the rate at which the drug crosses the placenta and the amount of drug reaching the fetus; (3) the duration of exposure to the drug; (4) distribution characteristics in different fetal tissues; (5) the stage of placental and fetal development at the time of exposure to the drug; and (6) the effects of drugs used in combination.

\section*{LIPID SOLUBILITY}

As is true also of other biologic membranes, drug passage across the placenta is dependent on lipid solubility and the degree of drug ionization. Lipophilic drugs tend to diffuse readily across the placenta and enter the fetal circulation. For example, thiopental, a drug commonly used for cesarean sections, crosses the placenta almost immediately and can produce sedation or apnea in the newborn infant. Highly ionized drugs such as succinylcholine and tubocurarine, also used for cesarean sections, cross the placenta slowly and achieve very low concentrations in the fetus. Impermeability of the placenta to polar compounds is relative rather than absolute. If high enough maternal-fetal concentration gradients are achieved, polar compounds cross the placenta in measurable amounts. Salicylate, which is almost completely ionized at physiologic pH, crosses the placenta rapidly. This occurs because the small amount of salicylate that is not ionized is highly lipid-soluble.

\section*{MOLECULAR SIZE}

The molecular weight of the drug also influences the rate of transfer and the amount of drug transferred across the placenta. Drugs with molecular weights of 250-500 can cross the placenta easily, depending upon their lipid solubility and degree of ionization; those with molecular weights of 500-1000 cross the placenta with more difficulty; and those with molecular weights greater than 1000 cross very poorly. An important clinical application of this property is the choice of heparin as an anticoagulant in pregnant women. Because it is a very large (and polar) molecule, heparin is unable to cross the placenta. Unlike warfarin, which is teratogenic and should be avoided during the first trimester and even beyond (as the brain continues to develop), heparin may be safely given to pregnant women who need anticoagulation. Yet the placenta contains drug transporters, which can carry larger molecules to the fetus. For example, a variety of maternal antibodies cross the placenta and may cause fetal morbidity, as in Rh incompatibility.

\section*{PLACENTAL TRANSPORTERS}

During the last decade, many drug transporters have been identified in the placenta, with increasing recognition of their effects on drug transfer to the fetus. For example, the P-glycoprotein transporter encoded by the MDR1 gene pumps back into the maternal circulation a variety of drugs, including cancer drugs (eg, vinblastine, doxorubicin) and other agents. Similarly, viral protease inhibitors, which are substrates to P-glycoprotein, achieve only low fetal concentrations-an effect that may increase the risk of vertical HIV infection from the mother to the fetus. The hypoglycemic drug glyburide cannot be measured in umbilical blood despite therapeutic maternal concentrations. Recent work has documented that this agent is effluxed from the fetal circulation by the BCRP transporter as well as by the MRP3 transporter located in the placental brush border membrane.

\section*{PROTEIN BINDING}

The degree to which a drug is bound to plasma proteins (particularly albumin) may also affect the rate of transfer and the amount transferred. However, if a compound is very lipid-soluble (eg, some anesthetic gases), it will not be affected greatly by protein binding. Transfer of these more lipid-soluble drugs and their overall rates of equilibration are more dependent on (and proportionate to) placental blood flow. This is because very lipid-soluble drugs diffuse across placental membranes so rapidly that their overall rates of equilibration do not depend on the free drug concentrations becoming equal on both sides. If a drug is poorly lipid-soluble and is ionized, its transfer is slow and will probably be impeded by its binding to maternal plasma proteins. Differential protein binding is also important since some drugs exhibit greater protein binding in maternal plasma than in fetal plasma because of a lower binding affinity of fetal proteins. This has been shown for sulfonamides, barbiturates, phenytoin, and local anesthetic agents.

\section*{PLACENTAL AND FETAL DRUG METABOLISM}

Two mechanisms help protect the fetus from drugs in the maternal circulation: (1) The placenta itself plays a role both as a semipermeable barrier and as a site of metabolism of some drugs passing through it. Several different types of aromatic oxidation reactions (eg, hydroxylation, N -dealkylation, demethylation) have been shown to occur in placental tissue. Pentobarbital is oxidized in this way. Conversely, it is possible that the metabolic capacity of the placenta may lead to creation of toxic metabolites, and the placenta may therefore augment toxicity (eg, ethanol, benzpyrenes). (2) Drugs that have crossed the placenta enter the fetal circulation via the umbilical vein. About 40-60\% of umbilical venous blood flow enters the fetal liver; the remainder bypasses the liver and enters the general fetal circulation. A drug that enters the liver may be partially metabolized there before it enters the fetal circulation. In addition, a large proportion of drug present in the umbilical artery (returning to the placenta) may be shunted through the placenta back to the umbilical vein and into the liver again. It should be noted that metabolites of some drugs may be more active than the parent compound and may affect the fetus adversely.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

\section*{MATERNAL DRUG ACTIONS}

The effects of drugs on the reproductive tissues (breast, uterus, etc) of the pregnant woman are sometimes altered by the endocrine environment appropriate for the stage of pregnancy. Drug effects on other maternal tissues (heart, lungs, kidneys, central nervous system, etc) are not changed significantly by pregnancy, although the physiologic context (cardiac output, renal blood flow, etc) may be altered, requiring the use of drugs that are not needed by the same woman when she is not pregnant. For example, cardiac glycosides and diuretics may be needed for heart failure precipitated by the increased cardiac workload of pregnancy, or insulin may be required for control of blood glucose in pregnancy-induced
diabetes.

\section*{THERAPEUTIC DRUG ACTIONS IN THE FETUS}

Fetal therapeutics is an emerging area in perinatal pharmacology. This involves drug administration to the pregnant woman with the fetus as the target of the drug. At present, corticosteroids are used to stimulate fetal lung maturation when preterm birth is expected. Phenobarbital, when given to pregnant women near term, can induce fetal hepatic enzymes responsible for the glucuronidation of bilirubin, and the incidence of jaundice is lower in newborns when mothers are given phenobarbital than when phenobarbital is not used. Before phototherapy became the preferred mode of therapy for neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia, phenobarbital was used for this indication. Administration of phenobarbital to the mother was suggested recently as a means of decreasing the risk of intracranial bleeding in preterm infants. However, large randomized studies failed to confirm this effect. Antiarrhythmic drugs have also been given to mothers for treatment of fetal cardiac arrhythmias. Although their efficacy has not yet been established by controlled studies, digoxin, flecainide, procainamide, verapamil, and other antiarrhythmic agents have been shown to be effective in case series. During the last decade it has been shown that maternal use of zidovudine decreases by two thirds transmission of HIV from the mother to the fetus, and use of combinations of three antiretroviral agents can eliminate fetal infection almost entirely (see Chapter 49).

\section*{PREDICTABLE TOXIC DRUG ACTIONS IN THE FETUS}

Chronic use of opioids by the mother may produce dependence in the fetus and newborn. This dependence may be manifested after delivery as a neonatal withdrawal syndrome. A less well understood fetal drug toxicity is caused by the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during pregnancy. These drugs can result in significant and irreversible renal damage in the fetus and are therefore contraindicated in pregnant women. Adverse effects may also be delayed, as in the case of female fetuses exposed to diethylstilbestrol, who may be at increased risk for adenocarcinoma of the vagina after puberty.

\section*{TERATOGENIC DRUG ACTIONS}

A single intrauterine exposure to a drug can affect the fetal structures undergoing rapid development at the time of exposure. Thalidomide is an example of a drug that may profoundly affect the development of the limbs after only brief exposure. This exposure, however, must be at a critical time in the development of the limbs. The thalidomide phocomelia risk occurs during the fourth through the seventh weeks of gestation because it is during this time that the arms and legs develop (Figure 60-1).

\section*{Teratogenic Mechanisms}

The mechanisms by which different drugs produce teratogenic effects are poorly understood and are probably multifactorial. For example, drugs may have a direct effect on maternal tissues with secondary or indirect effects on fetal tissues. Drugs may interfere with the passage of oxygen or nutrients through the placenta and therefore have effects on the most rapidly metabolizing tissues of the fetus. Finally, drugs may have important direct actions on the processes of differentiation in developing tissues. For example, vitamin A (retinol) has been shown to have important differentiation-directing actions in normal tissues. Several vitamin A analogs (isotretinoin, etretinate) are powerful teratogens, suggesting that they alter the normal processes of differentiation. Finally, deficiency of a critical substance appears to play a role in some types of abnormalities. For example, folic acid supplementation during pregnancy appears to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects (eg, spina bifida).

Continued exposure to a teratogen may produce cumulative effects or may affect several organs going through varying stages of development. Chronic consumption of high doses of ethanol during pregnancy, particularly during the first and second trimesters, may result in the fetal alcohol syndrome (see Chapter 23). In this syndrome, the central nervous system, growth, and facial development may be affected.

\section*{Defining a Teratogen}

To be considered teratogenic, a candidate substance or process should (1) result in a characteristic set of malformations, indicating selectivity for certain target organs; (2) exert its effects at a particular stage of fetal development, ie, during the limited time period of organogenesis of the target organs (Figure 60-1); and (3) show a dose-dependent incidence. Some drugs with known teratogenic or other adverse effects in pregnancy are listed in Table 60-1.

The widely cited Food and Drug Administration system for teratogenic potential (Table 60-2) is an attempt to quantify teratogenic risk from A (safe) to $X$ (definite human teratogenic risk). This system has been criticized as inaccurate and impractical. For example, several drugs have been labeled " $X$ " despite extensive opposite human safety data (eg, oral contraceptives). Diazepam and other benzodiazepines are labeled as "D" despite lack of positive evidence of human fetal risk.
Table 60-2. FDA Teratogenic Risk Categories.

\section*{Category Description}

A
Controlled studies in women fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester (and there is no evidence of a risk in late trimesters), and the possibility of fetal harm appears remote.

B
Either animal-reproduction studies have not demonstrated a fetal risk, but there are no controlled studies in pregnant women, or animal-reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect (other than a decrease in fertility) that was not confirmed in controlled studies in women in the first trimester (and there is no evidence of a risk in later trimesters).

C
Either studies in animals have revealed adverse effects on the fetus (teratogenic or embryocidal or other) and there are no controlled studies in women or studies in women and animals are not available. Drugs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

D
There is positive evidence of human fetal risk, but the benefits from use in pregnant women may be acceptable despite the risk (eg, if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or for a serious disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective).

X
Studies in animals or human beings have demonstrated fetal abnormalities or there is evidence of fetal risk based on human experience or both, and the risk of the use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweighs any possible benefit. The drug is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant.

\section*{Counseling Women About Teratogenic Risk}

Since the thalidomide disaster, medicine has been practiced as if every drug were a potential human teratogen when, in fact, fewer than 30 such drugs have been identified, with hundreds of agents proved
safe for the unborn. Owing to high levels of anxiety among pregnant women-and because half of the pregnancies in North America are unplanned-every year many thousands of women need counseling about fetal exposure to drugs, chemicals, and radiation. In the Motherisk program in Toronto, thousands of women are counseled every month, and the ability of appropriate counseling to prevent unnecessary abortions has been documented. Clinicians who wish to provide such counsel to pregnant women must ensure that their information is up to date and evidence-based and that the woman understands that the baseline teratogenic risk in pregnancy (ie, the risk of a neonatal abnormality in the absence of any known teratogenic exposure) is about $3 \%$. It is also critical to address the maternal-fetal risks of the untreated condition if a medication is avoided. Recent studies show serious morbidity in women who discontinued selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor therapy for depression in pregnancy.

\section*{DRUG THERAPY IN INFANTS \& CHILDREN}

Physiologic processes that influence pharmacokinetic variables in the infant change significantly in the first year of life, particularly during the first few months. Therefore, special attention must be paid to pharmacokinetics in this age group. Pharmacodynamic differences between pediatric and other patients have not been explored in great detail and are probably small except for those specific target tissues that mature at birth or immediately thereafter (eg, the ductus arteriosus).

\section*{Drug Absorption}

Drug absorption in infants and children follows the same general principles as in adults. Unique factors that influence drug absorption include blood flow at the site of administration, as determined by the physiologic status of the infant or child; and, for orally administered drugs, gastrointestinal function, which changes rapidly during the first few days after birth. Age after birth also influences the regulation of drug absorption.

\section*{BLOOD FLOW AT THE SITE OF ADMI NI STRATI ON}

Absorption after intramuscular or subcutaneous injection depends mainly, in neonates as in adults, on the rate of blood flow to the muscle or subcutaneous area injected. Physiologic conditions that might reduce blood flow to these areas are cardiovascular shock, vasoconstriction due to sympathomimetic agents, and heart failure. However, sick preterm infants requiring intramuscular injections may have very little muscle mass. This is further complicated by diminished peripheral perfusion to these areas. In such cases, absorption becomes irregular and difficult to predict, because the drug may remain in the muscle and be absorbed more slowly than expected. If perfusion suddenly improves, there can be a sudden and unpredictable increase in the amount of drug entering the circulation, resulting in high and potentially toxic concentrations of drug. Examples of drugs especially hazardous in such situations are cardiac glycosides, aminoglycoside antibiotics, and anticonvulsants.

\section*{GASTROI NTESTI NAL FUNCTION}

Significant biochemical and physiologic changes occur in the neonatal gastrointestinal tract shortly after birth. In full-term infants, gastric acid secretion begins soon after birth and increases gradually over several hours. In preterm infants, the secretion of gastric acid occurs more slowly, with the highest concentrations appearing on the fourth day of life. Therefore, drugs that are partially or totally inactivated by the low pH of gastric contents should not be administered orally.

Gastric emptying time is prolonged (up to 6 or 8 hours) in the first day or so after delivery. Therefore, drugs that are absorbed primarily in the stomach may be absorbed more completely than anticipated. In
the case of drugs absorbed in the small intestine, therapeutic effect may be delayed. Peristalsis in the neonate is irregular and may be slow. The amount of drug absorbed in the small intestine may therefore be unpredictable; more than the usual amount of drug may be absorbed if peristalsis is slowed, and this could result in potential toxicity from an otherwise standard dose. Table 60-3 summarizes data on oral bioavailability of various drugs in neonates compared with older children and adults. An increase in peristalsis, as in diarrheal conditions, tends to decrease the extent of absorption, because contact time with the large absorptive surface of the intestine is decreased.

Gastrointestinal enzyme activities tend to be lower in the newborn than in the adult. Activities of amylase and other pancreatic enzymes in the duodenum are low in infants up to 4 months of age. Neonates also have low concentrations of bile acids and lipase, which may decrease the absorption of lipid-soluble drugs.

\section*{Drug Distribution}

As body composition changes with development, the distribution volumes of drugs are also changed. The neonate has a higher percentage of its body weight in the form of water (70-75\%) than does the adult ( $50-60 \%$ ). Differences can also be observed between the full-term neonate ( $70 \%$ of body weight as water)
and the small preterm neonate ( $85 \%$ of body weight as water). Similarly, extracellular water is $40 \%$ of body weight in the neonate, compared with $20 \%$ in the adult. Most neonates will experience diuresis in the first 24-48 hours of life. Since many drugs are distributed throughout the extracellular water space, the size (volume) of the extracellular water compartment may be important in determining the concentration of drug at receptor sites. This is especially important for water-soluble drugs (such as aminoglycosides) and less crucial for lipid-soluble agents.

Preterm infants have much less fat than full-term infants. Total body fat in preterm infants is about $1 \%$ of total body weight, compared with $15 \%$ in full-term neonates. Therefore, organs that generally accumulate high concentrations of lipid-soluble drugs in adults and older children may accumulate smaller amounts of these agents in less mature infants.

Another major factor determining drug distribution is drug binding to plasma proteins. Albumin is the plasma protein with the greatest binding capacity. In general, protein binding of drugs is reduced in the neonate. This has been seen with local anesthetic drugs, diazepam, phenytoin, ampicillin, and phenobarbital. Therefore, the concentration of free (unbound) drug in plasma is increased initially. Because the free drug exerts the pharmacologic effect, this can result in greater drug effect or toxicity despite a normal or even low plasma concentration of total drug (bound plus unbound). Consider a therapeutic dose of a drug (eg, diazepam) given to a patient. The concentration of total drug in the plasma is $300 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{L}$. If the drug is $98 \%$ protein-bound in an older child or adult, then $6 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{L}$ is the concentration of free drug. Assume that this concentration of free drug produces the desired effect in the patient without producing toxicity. However, if this drug is given to a preterm infant in a dosage adjusted for body weight and it produces a total drug concentration of $300 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{L}$-and protein binding is only $90 \%$-then the free drug concentration will be $30 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{L}$, or five times higher. Although the higher free concentration may result in faster elimination (see Chapter 3), this concentration may be quite toxic initially.

Some drugs compete with serum bilirubin for binding to albumin. Drugs given to a neonate with jaundice can displace bilirubin from albumin. Because of the greater permeability of the neonatal blood-brain barrier, substantial amounts of bilirubin may enter the brain and cause kernicterus. This was in fact observed when sulfonamide antibiotics were given to preterm neonates as prophylaxis against sepsis. Conversely, as the serum bilirubin rises for physiologic reasons or because of a blood group incompatibility, bilirubin can displace a drug from albumin and substantially raise the free drug concentration. This may occur without altering the total drug concentration and would result in greater therapeutic effect or toxicity at normal concentrations. This has been shown to happen with phenytoin.

\section*{Drug Metabolism}

The metabolism of most drugs occurs in the liver (see Chapter 4). The drug-metabolizing activities of the cytochrome P450-dependent mixed-function oxidases and the conjugating enzymes are substantially lower ( $50-70 \%$ of adult values) in early neonatal life than later. The point in development at which enzymatic activity is maximal depends upon the specific enzyme system in question. Glucuronide formation reaches adult values (per kilogram body weight) between the third and fourth years of life. Because of the neonate's decreased ability to metabolize drugs, many drugs have slow clearance rates and prolonged elimination half-lives. If drug doses and dosing schedules are not altered appropriately, this immaturity predisposes the neonate to adverse effects from drugs that are metabolized by the liver. Table 60-4 demonstrates how neonatal and adult drug elimination half-lives can differ and how the half-lives of phenobarbital and phenytoin decrease as the neonate grows older. The process of maturation must be
considered when administering drugs to this age group, especially in the case of drugs administered over long periods.

Another consideration for the neonate is whether or not the mother was receiving drugs (eg, phenobarbital) that can induce early maturation of fetal hepatic enzymes. In this case, the ability of the neonate to metabolize certain drugs will be greater than expected, and one may see less therapeutic effect and lower plasma drug concentrations when the usual neonatal dose is given.

\section*{Drug Excretion}

The glomerular filtration rate is much lower in newborns than in older infants, children, or adults, and this limitation persists during the first few days of life. Calculated on the basis of body surface area, glomerular filtration in the neonate is only 30-40\% of the adult value. The glomerular filtration rate is even lower in neonates born before 34 weeks of gestation. Function improves substantially during the first week of life. At the end of the first week, the glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow have increased $50 \%$ from the first day. By the end of the third week, glomerular filtration is $50-60 \%$ of the adult value; by $6-12$ months, it reaches adult values (per unit surface area). Therefore, drugs that depend on renal function for elimination are cleared from the body very slowly in the first weeks of life.

Penicillins, for example, are cleared by preterm infants at 17\% of the adult rate based on comparable
surface area and $34 \%$ of the adult rate when adjusted for body weight. The dosage of ampicillin for a neonate less than 7 days old is $50-100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in two doses at 12 -hour intervals. The dosage for a neonate over 7 days old is $100-200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in three doses at 8 -hour intervals. A decreased rate of renal elimination in the neonate has also been observed with aminoglycoside antibiotics (kanamycin, gentamicin, neomycin, and streptomycin). The dosage of gentamicin for a neonate less than 7 days old is $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in two doses at 12-hour intervals. The dosage for a neonate over 7 days old is $7.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in three doses at 8-hour intervals. Total body clearance of digoxin is directly dependent upon adequate renal function, and accumulation of digoxin can occur when glomerular filtration is decreased. Since renal function in a sick infant may not improve at the predicted rate during the first weeks and months of life, appropriate adjustments in dosage and dosing schedules may be very difficult. In this situation, adjustments are best made on the basis of plasma drug concentrations determined at intervals throughout the course of therapy.

While great focus is naturally concentrated on the neonate, it is important to remember that toddlers may have shorter elimination half-lives of drugs than older children and adults, due probably to increased renal elimination and metabolism. For example, the dose per kilogram of digoxin is much higher in toddlers than in adults. The mechanisms for these developmental changes are still poorly understood.

\section*{Special Pharmacodynamic Features in the Neonate}

The appropriate use of drugs has made possible the survival of neonates with severe abnormalities who would otherwise die within days or weeks after birth. For example, administration of indomethacin (see Chapter 35) causes the rapid closure of a patent ductus arteriosus, which would otherwise require surgical closure in an infant with a normal heart. Infusion of prostaglandin $E_{1}$, on the other hand, causes the ductus to remain open, which can be life-saving in an infant with transposition of the great vessels or tetralogy of Fallot (see Chapter 18). An unexpected effect of such infusion has been described. The drug caused antral hyperplasia with gastric outlet obstruction as a clinical manifestation in 6 of 74 infants who received it. This phenomenon appears to be dose-dependent.

\section*{PEDI ATRI C DOSAGE FORMS \& COMPLI ANCE}

The form in which a drug is manufactured and the way in which the parent dispenses the drug to the child determine the actual dose administered. Many drugs prepared for children are in the form of elixirs or suspensions. Elixirs are alcoholic solutions in which the drug molecules are dissolved and evenly distributed. No shaking is required, and unless some of the vehicle has evaporated, the first dose from the bottle and the last dose should contain equivalent amounts of drug. Suspensions contain undissolved particles of drug that must be distributed throughout the vehicle by shaking. If shaking is not thorough each time a dose is given, the first doses from the bottle may contain less drug than the last doses, with the result that less than the expected plasma concentration or effect of the drug may be achieved early in the course of therapy. Conversely, toxicity may occur late in the course of therapy, when it is not expected. This uneven distribution is a potential cause of inefficacy or toxicity in children taking phenytoin suspensions. It is thus essential that the prescriber know the form in which the drug will be dispensed and provide proper instructions to the pharmacist and patient or parent.

Compliance may be more difficult to achieve in pediatric practice than otherwise, since it involves not only the parent's conscientious effort to follow directions but also such practical matters as measuring errors, spilling, and spitting out. For example, the measured volume of "teaspoons" ranges from 2.5 to 7.8 mL .

The parents should obtain a calibrated medicine spoon or syringe from the pharmacy. These devices improve the accuracy of dose measurements and simplify administration of drugs to children.

When evaluating compliance, it is often helpful to ask if an attempt has been made to give a further dose after the child has spilled half of what was offered. The parents may not always be able to say with confidence how much of a dose the child actually received. The parents must be told whether or not to wake the infant for its every-6-hour dose day or night. These matters should be discussed and made clear, and no assumptions should be made about what the parents may or may not do. Noncompliance frequently occurs when antibiotics are prescribed to treat otitis media or urinary tract infections and the child feels well after 4 or 5 days of therapy. The parents may not feel there is any reason to continue giving the medicine even though it was prescribed for 10 or 14 days. This common situation should be anticipated so the parents can be told why it is important to continue giving the medicine for the prescribed period even if the child seems to be "cured."

Practical and convenient dosage forms and dosing schedules should be chosen to the extent possible. The easier it is to administer and take the medicine and the easier the dosing schedule is to follow, the more likely it is that compliance will be achieved.

Consistent with their ability to comprehend and cooperate, children should also be given some responsibility for their own health care and for taking medications. This should be discussed in appropriate terms both with the child and with the parents. Possible adverse effects and drug interactions with over-the-counter medicines or foods should also be discussed. Whenever a drug does not achieve its therapeutic effect, the possibility of noncompliance should be considered. There is ample evidence that in such cases parents' or children's reports may be grossly inaccurate. Random pill counts and measurement of serum concentrations may help disclose noncompliance. The use of computerized pill containers, which record each lid opening, has been shown to be very effective in measuring compliance.

Because many pediatric doses are calculated-eg, using body weight-rather than simply read from a list, major dosing errors may result from incorrect calculations. Typically, tenfold errors due to incorrect placement of the decimal point have been described. In the case of digoxin, for example, an intended dose of 0.1 mL containing 5 mcg of drug, when replaced by 1.0 mL -which is still a small volume-can result in fatal overdosage. A good rule for avoiding such "decimal point" errors is to use a leading "0" plus decimal point when dealing with doses less than "1" and to avoid using a zero after a decimal point (see Chapter 66).

\section*{DRUG USE DURI NG LACTATI ON}

Despite the fact that most drugs are excreted into breast milk in amounts too small to adversely affect neonatal health, thousands of women taking medications do not breast-feed because of misperception of risk. Unfortunately, physicians contribute heavily to this bias. It is important to remember that formula feeding is associated with higher morbidity and mortality in all socioeconomic groups.

Most drugs administered to lactating women are detectable in breast milk. Fortunately, the concentration of drugs achieved in breast milk is usually low (Table 60-5). Therefore, the total amount the infant would receive in a day is substantially less than what would be considered a "therapeutic dose." If the nursing mother must take medications and the drug is a relatively safe one, she should optimally take it 30-60 minutes after nursing and 3-4 hours before the next feeding. This allows time for many drugs to be cleared
from the mother's blood, and the concentrations in breast milk will be relatively low. Drugs for which no data are available on safety during lactation should be avoided or breast-feeding discontinued while they are being given.

Most antibiotics taken by nursing mothers can be detected in breast milk. Tetracycline concentrations in breast milk are approximately $70 \%$ of maternal serum concentrations and present a risk of permanent tooth staining in the infant. Isoniazid rapidly reaches equilibrium between breast milk and maternal blood. The concentrations achieved in breast milk are high enough so that signs of pyridoxine deficiency may occur in the infant if the mother is not given pyridoxine supplements.

Most sedatives and hypnotics achieve concentrations in breast milk sufficient to produce a pharmacologic effect in some infants. Barbiturates taken in hypnotic doses by the mother can produce lethargy, sedation, and poor suck reflexes in the infant. Chloral hydrate can produce sedation if the infant is fed at peak milk concentrations. Diazepam can have a sedative effect on the nursing infant, but, most importantly, its long half-life can result in significant drug accumulation.

Opioids such as heroin, methadone, and morphine enter breast milk in quantities potentially sufficient to prolong the state of neonatal narcotic dependence if the drug was taken chronically by the mother during pregnancy. If conditions are well controlled and there is a good relationship between the mother and the physician, an infant could be breast-fed while the mother is taking methadone. She should not, however, stop taking the drug abruptly; the infant can be tapered off the methadone as the mother's dose is tapered. The infant should be watched for signs of narcotic withdrawal. Although codeine has been believed to be safe, a recent case of neonatal death from opioid toxicity revealed that the mother was an ultra rapid metabolizer of cytochrome 2D6 substrates, producing substantially higher amounts of morphine. Hence, polymorphism in maternal drug metabolism may affect neonatal exposure and safety.

Minimal use of alcohol by the mother has not been reported to harm nursing infants. Excessive amounts of alcohol, however, can produce alcohol effects in the infant. Nicotine concentrations in the breast milk of smoking mothers are low and do not produce effects in the infant. Very small amounts of caffeine are excreted in the breast milk of coffee-drinking mothers.

Lithium enters breast milk in concentrations equal to those in maternal serum. Clearance of this drug is almost completely dependent upon renal elimination, and women who are receiving lithium may expose the infant to relatively large amounts of the drug.

Radioactive substances such as iodinated ${ }^{125}$ I albumin and radioiodine can cause thyroid suppression in
infants and may increase the risk of subsequent thyroid cancer as much as tenfold. Breast-feeding is contraindicated after large doses and should be withheld for days to weeks after small doses. Similarly, breast-feeding should be avoided in mothers receiving cancer chemotherapy or being treated with cytotoxic or immune-modulating agents for collagen diseases such as lupus erythematosus or after organ transplantation.

\section*{PEDIATRIC DRUG DOSAGE}

Because of differences in pharmacokinetics in infants and children, simple proportionate reduction in the adult dose may not be adequate to determine a safe and effective pediatric dose. The most reliable pediatric dose information is usually that provided by the manufacturer in the package insert. However, such information is not available for the majority of products, even when studies have been published in the medical literature, reflecting the reluctance of manufacturers to label their products for children. Recently, the FDA has moved toward more explicit expectations that manufacturers test their new products in infants and children. Still, most drugs in the common formularies, eg, Physicians' Desk Reference, are not specifically approved for children, in part because manufacturers often lack the economic incentive to evaluate drugs for use in the pediatric market.

Most drugs approved for use in children have recommended pediatric doses, generally stated as milligrams per kilogram or per pound. In the absence of explicit pediatric dose recommendations, an approximation can be made by any of several methods based on age, weight, or surface area. These rules are not precise and shouldz not be used if the manufacturer provides a pediatric dose. When pediatric doses are calculated (either from one of the methods set forth below or from a manufacturer's dose), the pediatric dose should never exceed the adult dose.

\section*{Surface Area, Age, \& Weight}

Calculations of dosage based on age or weight (see below) are conservative and tend to underestimate the required dose. Doses based on surface area (Table 60-6) are more likely to be adequate.

${ }^{1}$ For example, if adult dose is $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, dose for 3 -month-old infant would be $0.18 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ or 1.1 mg total.

Age (Young's rule):
Dose $=$ Adult dose $\times \frac{\text { Age (years) }}{\text { Age }+12}$

Weight (somewhat more precise is Clark's rule):
Dose $=$ Adult dose $\times \frac{\text { Weight }(\mathrm{kg})}{70}$
or
Dose $=$ Adult dose $\times \frac{\text { Weight }(\mathrm{lb})}{150}$

In spite of these approximations, only by conducting studies in children can safe and effective doses for a given age group and condition be determined.

\section*{SPECI AL ASPECTS OF GERI ATRI C PHARMACOLOGY: INTRODUCTION}

Society has traditionally classified everyone over 65 as "elderly," but most authorities consider the field of geriatrics to apply to persons over 75-even though this too is an arbitrary definition. Furthermore, chronologic age is only one determinant of the changes pertinent to drug therapy that occur in older people. Important changes in responses to some drugs occur with increasing age in many individuals. For other drugs, age-related changes are minimal, especially in the "healthy old." Drug usage patterns also change as a result of the increasing incidence of disease with age and the tendency to prescribe heavily for patients in nursing homes. General changes in the lives of older people have significant effects on the way drugs are used. Among these changes are the increased incidence with advancing age of multiple diseases, nutritional problems, reduced financial resources, and-in some patients-decreased dosing compliance for a variety of reasons. The health practitioner should be aware of the changes in pharmacologic responses that may occur in older people and how to deal with these changes.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC CHANGES ASSOCI ATED WITH AGI NG}

In the general population, measurements of functional capacity of most of the major organ systems show a decline beginning in young adulthood and continuing throughout life. As shown in Figure 61-1, there is no "middle-age plateau" but rather a linear decrease beginning no later than age 45. However, these data reflect the mean and do not apply to every person above a certain age; approximately one third of healthy subjects have no age-related decrease in, for example, creatinine clearance up to the age of 75. Thus, the elderly do not lose specific functions at an accelerated rate compared with young and middle-aged adults but rather accumulate more deficiencies with the passage of time. Some of these changes result in altered pharmacokinetics. For the pharmacologist and the clinician, the most important of these is the decrease in renal function. Other changes and concurrent diseases may alter the pharmacodynamic characteristics of particular drugs in certain patients.

\section*{Pharmacokinetic Changes}

\section*{ABSORPTION}

There is little evidence for any major alteration in drug absorption with age. However, conditions associated with age may alter the rate at which some drugs are absorbed. Such conditions include altered nutritional habits, greater consumption of nonprescription drugs (eg, antacids, laxatives), and changes in gastric emptying, which is often slower in older persons, especially in older diabetics.

\section*{DISTRI BUTION}

Compared with young adults, the elderly have reduced lean body mass, reduced body water, and increased fat as a percentage of body mass. Some of these changes are shown in Table 61-1. There is usually a decrease in serum albumin, which binds many drugs, especially weak acids. There may be a concurrent increase in serum orosomucoid (a-acid glycoprotein), a protein that binds many basic drugs. Thus, the ratio of bound to free drug may be significantly altered. As explained in Chapter 3, these changes may alter the appropriate loading dose of a drug. However, since both the clearance and the effects of drugs are related to the free concentration, the steady-state effects of a maintenance dosage regimen should not be altered by these factors alone. For example, the loading dose of digoxin in an elderly patient with heart failure should be reduced (if used at all) because of the decreased apparent volume of distribution. The maintenance dose may have to be reduced because of reduced clearance of the drug.

\section*{METABOLISM}

The capacity of the liver to metabolize drugs does not appear to decline consistently with age for all drugs. Animal studies and some clinical studies have suggested that certain drugs are metabolized more slowly; some of these drugs are listed in Table 61-2. The greatest changes are in phase I reactions, ie, those carried out by microsomal P450 systems; there are much smaller changes in the ability of the liver to carry out conjugation (phase II) reactions (see Chapter 4). Some of these changes may be caused by decreased liver blood flow (Table 61-1), an important variable in the clearance of drugs that have a high hepatic extraction ratio. In addition, there is a decline with age of the liver's ability to recover from injury, eg, that caused by alcohol or viral hepatitis. Therefore, a history of recent liver disease in an older person should lead to caution in dosing with drugs that are cleared primarily by the liver, even after apparently complete recovery from the hepatic insult. Finally, malnutrition and diseases that affect hepatic function-eg, heart failure-are more common in the elderly. Heart failure may dramatically alter the ability of the liver to metabolize drugs and may also reduce hepatic blood flow. Similarly, severe nutritional deficiencies, which occur more often in old age, may impair hepatic function.

\section*{ELI MINATION}

Because the kidney is the major organ for clearance of drugs from the body, the age-related decline of renal functional capacity referred to above is very important. The decline in creatinine clearance occurs in about two thirds of the population. It is important to note that this decline is not reflected in an equivalent rise in serum creatinine because the production of creatinine is also reduced as muscle mass declines with age. The practical result of this change is marked prolongation of the half-life of many drugs and the possibility of accumulation to toxic levels if dosage is not reduced in size or frequency. Dosing recommendations for the elderly often include an allowance for reduced renal clearance. If only the young adult dosage is known for a drug that requires renal clearance, a rough
correction can be made by using the Cockcroft-Gault formula, which is applicable to patients from age 40 through age 80:
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Creatinine } \\
& \text { clearance } \\
& (\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{min})
\end{aligned}=\frac{(140-\text { Age }) \times(\text { Weight in } \mathrm{kg})}{72 \times \text { Serum creatinine in } \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}}$$

For women, the result should be multiplied by 0.85 . It must be emphasized that this estimate is, at best, a population estimate and may not apply to a particular patient. If the patient has normal renal function (up to one third of elderly patients), a dose corrected on the basis of this estimate will be too low-but a low dose is initially desirable if one is uncertain of the renal function in any patient. If a precise measure is needed, a standard 12- or 24-hour creatinine clearance determination should be obtained. As indicated above, nutritional changes alter pharmacokinetic parameters. A patient who is severely dehydrated (not uncommon in patients with stroke or other motor impairment) may have an additional marked reduction in renal drug clearance that is completely reversible by rehydration.

The lungs are important for the excretion of volatile drugs. As a result of reduced respiratory capacity (Figure 61-1) and the increased incidence of active pulmonary disease in the elderly, the use of inhalation anesthesia is less common and parenteral agents more common in this age group. (See Chapter 25.)

\section*{Pharmacodynamic Changes}

It was long believed that geriatric patients were much more "sensitive" to the action of many drugs, implying a change in the pharmacodynamic interaction of the drugs with their receptors. It is now recognized that many—perhaps most—of these apparent changes result from altered pharmacokinetics or diminished homeostatic responses. Clinical studies have supported the idea that the elderly are more sensitive to some sedative-hypnotics and analgesics. In addition, some data from animal studies suggest actual changes with age in the characteristics or numbers of a few receptors. The most extensive studies show a decrease in responsiveness to B-adrenoceptor agonists. Other examples are discussed below.

Certain homeostatic control mechanisms appear to be blunted in the elderly. Since homeostatic responses are often important components of the total response to a drug, these physiologic alterations may change the pattern or intensity of drug response. In the cardiovascular system, the cardiac output increment required by mild or moderate exercise is successfully provided until at least age 75 (in individuals without obvious cardiac disease), but the increase is the result primarily of increased stroke volume in the elderly and not tachycardia, as in young adults. Average blood pressure goes up with age (in most Western countries), but the incidence of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension also increases markedly. It is thus particularly important to check for orthostatic hypotension on every visit. Similarly, the average 2-hour postprandial blood glucose level increases by about $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ for each year of age above 50. Temperature regulation is also impaired, and hypothermia is poorly tolerated in the elderly.

\section*{Behavioral \& Lifestyle Changes}

Major changes in the conditions of daily life accompany the aging process and have an impact on health. Some of these (eg, forgetting to take one's pills) are the result of cognitive changes associated
with vascular or other pathology. Others relate to economic stresses associated with greatly reduced income and, possibly, increased expenses due to illness. One of the most important changes is the loss of a spouse.

\section*{MAJ OR DRUG GROUPS}

\section*{CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DRUGS}

\section*{Sedative-Hypnotics}

The half-lives of many benzodiazepines and barbiturates increase by $50-150 \%$ between age 30 and age 70. Much of this change occurs during the decade from 60 to 70. For many of the benzodiazepines, both the parent molecule and its metabolites (produced in the liver) are pharmacologically active (see Chapter 22). The age-related decline in renal function and liver disease, if present, both contribute to the reduction in elimination of these compounds. In addition, an increased volume of distribution has been reported for some of these drugs. Lorazepam and oxazepam may be less affected by these changes than the other benzodiazepines. In addition to these pharmacokinetic factors, it is generally believed that the elderly vary more in their sensitivity to the sedative-hypnotic drugs on a pharmacodynamic basis as well. Among the toxicities of these drugs, ataxia and other signs of motor impairment should be particularly watched for in order to avoid accidents.

\section*{Analgesics}

The opioid analgesics show variable changes in pharmacokinetics with age. However, the elderly are often markedly more sensitive to the respiratory effects of these agents because of age-related changes in respiratory function. Therefore, this group of drugs should be used with caution until the sensitivity of the particular patient has been evaluated, and the patient should then be dosed appropriately for full effect. Unfortunately, studies show that opioids are consistently underutilized in patients who require strong analgesics for chronic painful conditions such as cancer. There is no justification for underutilization of these drugs, especially in the care of the elderly, and good pain management plans are readily available (see Rabow, 2004; Schug et al, 1992).

\section*{Antipsychotic \& Antidepressant Drugs}

The traditional antipsychotic agents (phenothiazines and haloperidol) have been very heavily used (and probably misused) in the management of a variety of psychiatric diseases in the elderly. There is no doubt that they are useful in the management of schizophrenia in old age, and they are probably useful also in the treatment of some symptoms associated with delirium, dementia, agitation, combativeness, and a paranoid syndrome that occurs in some geriatric patients. However, they are not fully satisfactory in these geriatric conditions, and dosage should not be increased on the assumption that full control is possible. There is no evidence that these drugs have any beneficial effects in Alzheimer's dementia, and on theoretical grounds the antimuscarinic effects of the phenothiazines might be expected to worsen memory impairment and intellectual dysfunction (see below). Much of the apparent improvement in agitated and combative patients may simply reflect the sedative effects of the drugs. When a sedative antipsychotic is desired, a phenothiazine such as thioridazine is appropriate. If sedation is to be avoided, haloperidol is more appropriate. The latter drug has increased extrapyramidal toxicity, however, and should be avoided in patients with preexisting
extrapyramidal disease. The phenothiazines, especially older drugs such as chlorpromazine, often induce orthostatic hypotension because of their a-adrenoceptor-blocking effects. They are even more prone to do so in the elderly.

Because of increased responsiveness to all these drugs, dosage should usually be started at a fraction of that used in young adults. The half-lives of some phenothiazines are increased in the geriatric population. Thioridazine's half-life, for example, is more than doubled. Plasma protein binding of fluphenazine is reduced, which results in an increase of the free drug: total drug ratio.

Lithium is often used in the treatment of mania in the aged. Because it is cleared by the kidneys, dosages must be adjusted appropriately and blood levels monitored. Concurrent use of thiazide diuretics reduces the clearance of lithium and should be accompanied by further reduction in dosage and more frequent measurement of lithium blood levels.

Psychiatric depression is thought to be underdiagnosed and undertreated in the elderly. The suicide rate in the over-65 age group (twice the national average) supports this view. Unfortunately, the apathy, flat affect, and social withdrawal of major depression may be mistaken for senile dementia. Clinical evidence suggests that the elderly are as responsive to antidepressants (of all types) as younger patients but are more likely to experience toxic effects. This factor along with the reduced clearance of some of these drugs underlines the importance of careful dosing and strict attention to the appearance of toxic effects. If a tricyclic antidepressant is to be used, a drug with reduced antimuscarinic effects should be selected, eg, nortriptyline or desipramine (see Table 30-2). To minimize autonomic effects, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) may be chosen.

\section*{Drugs Used in Alzheimer's Disease}

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive impairment of memory and cognitive functions and may lead to a completely vegetative state and early death. The biochemical defects responsible for these changes have not been identified, but there is much evidence for a marked decrease in choline acetyltransferase and other markers of cholinergic neuron activity and for changes in brain glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and somatostatin activity. Eventually, cholinergic and perhaps other neurons die or are destroyed. Patients with Alzheimer's disease are often exquisitely sensitive to the central nervous system toxicities of drugs with antimuscarinic effects. There is also evidence for abnormal neuronal lipoprotein processing, and one familial form of Alzheimer's disease is strongly associated with an abnormal lipoprotein, apolipoprotein E4.

Many methods of treatment of Alzheimer's disease have been explored. Most attention has been focused on the cholinomimetic drugs because of the evidence for loss of cholinergic neurons noted above. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B inhibition with selegiline (L-deprenyl) has been suggested to have some beneficial effects. "Ampakines," substances that facilitate synaptic activity at glutamate AMPA receptors, and nerve growth factors (see Chapter 21), are also under intense study, and one drug that inhibits NMDA glutamate receptors is available (see below). Some evidence suggests that lipid-lowering statins are beneficial. So-called cerebral vasodilators are ineffective.

Tacrine (tetrahydroaminoacridine, THA), a long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor and muscarinic modulator, was the first drug shown to have any benefit in Alzheimer's disease. Tacrine is orally active, enters the central nervous system readily, and has a duration of effect of $6-8$ hours. Tacrine blocks both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase and has complex inhibitory effects on $\mathrm{M}_{1}, \mathrm{M}_{2}$, and
nicotinic cholinoceptors. The drug apparently increases the release of acetylcholine from cholinergic nerve endings as well. Finally, tacrine may inhibit MAO, decrease the release of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid, and increase the release of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin from nerve endings. Donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are newer cholinesterase inhibitors with adequate penetration into the central nervous system and a spectrum of action more limited to indirect cholinomimetic effects than tacrine's. Although the evidence for benefit from cholinesterase inhibitors appears to be robust, the effect is very modest and, at best, only delays further cognitive decline.

Tacrine causes significant adverse effects, including nausea and vomiting, and potentially dangerous hepatic toxicity. The latter is manifested by a reversible increase in serum levels of aspartate or alanine aminotransferase of sufficient magnitude to require dose reduction or withdrawal in $40-50 \%$ of patients. Hepatocellular necrosis with jaundice has been reported. The newer drugs appear to be significantly safer than tacrine. The cholinesterase inhibitors should be used with caution in patients receiving other drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes (eg, ketoconazole, quinidine; see Chapter 4). Preparations available are listed in Chapter 7.

Excitotoxic activation of glutamate transmission via NMDA receptors has been postulated to contribute to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Memantine binds to NMDA receptor channels in a usedependent manner and produces a noncompetitive blockade. This drug may slow progression of the disease. It appears to be better tolerated and less toxic than the cholinesterase inhibitors. Memantine is available as Namenda in 5 and 10 mg oral tablets.

\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR DRUGS}

\section*{Antihypertensive Drugs}

As noted previously, blood pressure, especially systolic pressure, increases with age in Western countries and in most cultures in which salt intake is high. In women, the increase is more marked after age 50. The high frequency and sometimes benign course of this form of late-onset systolic hypertension encouraged a conservative approach to its treatment in the past. It is now clear, however, that uncontrolled hypertension leads to the same sequelae in elderly as in younger individuals. Most clinicians believe that hypertension should be treated vigorously in the elderly.

The basic principles of therapy are not different in the geriatric age group from those described in Chapter 11, but the usual cautions regarding altered pharmacokinetics and sensitivity apply. Because of its safety, nondrug therapy (weight reduction in the obese and salt restriction) should be encouraged. Thiazides are a reasonable first step in drug therapy. The hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia caused by these agents are more relevant in the elderly because of the higher incidence in these patients of arrhythmias, type 2 diabetes, and gout. Thus, use of low antihypertensive doses-rather than maximum diuretic doses-is important. Calcium channel blockers are effective and safe if titrated to the appropriate response. They are especially useful in patients who also have atherosclerotic angina (see Chapter 12). Beta blockers are potentially hazardous in patients with obstructive airway disease and are considered less useful than calcium channel blockers in older patients unless heart failure is present. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are also considered less useful in the elderly unless heart failure or diabetes is present. The most powerful drugs, such as guanethidine and minoxidil, are rarely needed. Every patient receiving antihypertensive drugs should be checked regularly for orthostatic hypotension because of the danger of cerebral ischemia and falls.

\section*{Positive I notropic Agents}

Heart failure is a common and particularly lethal disease in the elderly. Fear of this condition may be one reason why physicians overuse cardiac glycosides in this age group. The toxic effects of this drug group are particularly dangerous in the geriatric population, since the elderly are more susceptible to arrhythmias. The clearance of digoxin is usually decreased in the older age group, and while the volume of distribution is often decreased as well, the half-life of this drug may be increased by $50 \%$ or more. Because the drug is cleared mostly by the kidneys, renal function must be considered in designing a dosage regimen. There is no evidence that there is any increase in pharmacodynamic sensitivity to the therapeutic effects of the cardiac glycosides; in fact, animal studies suggest a possible decrease in therapeutic sensitivity. On the other hand, as noted above, there is probably an increase in sensitivity to the toxic arrhythmogenic actions. Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypoxemia (from pulmonary disease), and coronary atherosclerosis all contribute to the high incidence of digitalisinduced arrhythmias in geriatric patients. The less common toxicities of digitalis such as delirium, visual changes, and endocrine abnormalities (see Chapter 13) also occur more often in older than in younger patients.

\section*{Antiarrhythmic Agents}

The treatment of arrhythmias in the elderly is particularly challenging because of the lack of good hemodynamic reserve, the frequency of electrolyte disturbances, and the high prevalence of severe coronary disease. The clearances of quinidine and procainamide decrease and their half-lives increase with age. Disopyramide should probably be avoided in the geriatric population because its major toxicities-antimuscarinic action, leading to voiding problems in men; and negative inotropic cardiac effects, leading to heart failure-are particularly undesirable in these patients. The clearance of lidocaine appears to be little changed, but the half-life is increased in the elderly. Although this observation implies an increase in the volume of distribution, it has been recommended that the loading dose of this drug be reduced in geriatric patients because of their greater sensitivity to its toxic effects.

Recent evidence indicates that many patients with atrial fibrillation-a very common arrhythmia in the elderly-do as well with simple control of ventricular rate as with conversion to normal sinus rhythm. Of course, measures (such as anticoagulant drugs) should be taken to reduce the risk of thromboembolism in chronic atrial fibrillation.

\section*{ANTI MI CROBI AL DRUGS}

Several age-related changes contribute to the high incidence of infections in geriatric patients. There appears to be a reduction in host defenses in the elderly, manifested in the increase in both serious infections and cancer. This may reflect an alteration in T-lymphocyte function. In the lungs, a major age- and tobacco-dependent decrease in mucociliary clearance significantly increases susceptibility to infection. In the urinary tract, the incidence of serious infection is greatly increased by urinary retention and catheterization in men.

Since 1940, the antimicrobial drugs have contributed more to the prolongation of life than any other drug group because they can compensate to some extent for this deterioration in natural defenses. The basic principles of therapy of the elderly with these agents are no different from those applicable in younger patients and have been presented in Chapter 51. The major pharmacokinetic changes relate
to decreased renal function; because most of the B-lactam, aminoglycoside, and fluoroquinolone antibiotics are excreted by this route, important changes in half-life may be expected. This is particularly important in the case of the aminoglycosides, because they cause concentration- and timedependent toxicity in the kidney and in other organs. For gentamicin, kanamycin, and netilmicin, the half-lives are more than doubled. According to one study, the increase may not be so marked for tobramycin.

\section*{ANTI-I NFLAMMATORY DRUGS}

Osteoarthritis is a very common disease of the elderly. Rheumatoid arthritis is less exclusively a geriatric problem, but the same drug therapy is usually applicable. The basic principles laid down in Chapter 36 and the properties of the anti-inflammatory drugs described there apply fully here.

The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) must be used with special care in geriatric patients because they cause toxicities to which the elderly are very susceptible. In the case of aspirin, the most important of these is gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding. In the case of the newer NSAIDs, the most important is renal damage, which may be irreversible. Because they are cleared primarily by the kidneys, these drugs will accumulate more rapidly in the geriatric patient and especially in the patient whose renal function is already compromised beyond the average range for his or her age. A vicious circle is easily set up in which cumulation of the NSAID causes more renal damage, which causes more cumulation. There is no evidence that the COX-2-selective NSAIDs are safer with regard to renal function. Elderly patients receiving high doses of any NSAID should be carefully monitored for changes in renal function.

Corticosteroids are extremely useful in elderly patients who cannot tolerate full doses of NSAIDs. However, they consistently cause a dose- and duration-related increase in osteoporosis, an especially hazardous toxic effect in the elderly. It is not certain whether this drug-induced effect can be reduced by increased calcium and vitamin D intake, but it would seem prudent to consider these agents (and bisphosphonates if osteoporosis is already present) and to encourage frequent exercise in any patient taking corticosteroids.

\section*{ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS IN THE ELDERLY}

The positive relationship between number of drugs taken and the incidence of adverse reactions to them has been well documented. In long-term care facilities, in which a high fraction of the population is elderly, the average number of prescriptions per patient varies between 6 and 8. Studies have shown that the percentage of patients with adverse reactions increases from about $10 \%$ when a single drug is being taken to nearly $100 \%$ when ten drugs are taken. Thus, it may be expected that about half of patients in long-term care facilities will have recognized or unrecognized reactions at some time. The overall incidence of drug reactions in geriatric patients is estimated to be at least twice that in the younger population. Reasons for this high incidence undoubtedly include errors in prescribing on the part of the practitioner and errors in drug usage by the patient.

Practitioner errors sometimes occur because the physician does not appreciate the importance of changes in pharmacokinetics with age and age-related diseases. Some errors occur because the practitioner is unaware of incompatible drugs prescribed by other practitioners for the same patient. For example, cimetidine, an $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-blocking drug heavily prescribed (or recommended in its over-the-
counter form) to the elderly, causes a much higher incidence of untoward effects (eg, confusion, slurred speech) in the geriatric population than in younger patients. It also inhibits the hepatic metabolism of many drugs, including phenytoin, warfarin, Bblockers, and other agents. A patient who has been taking one of the latter agents without untoward effect may develop markedly elevated blood levels and severe toxicity if cimetidine is added to the regimen without adjustment of dosage of the other drugs. Additional examples of drugs that inhibit liver microsomal enzymes and lead to adverse reactions are described in Chapter 4 and Appendix II.

Patient errors may result from noncompliance for reasons described below. In addition, they often result from use of nonprescription drugs taken without the knowledge of the physician. As noted in Chapters 64 and 65, many over-the-counter agents and herbal medications contain "hidden ingredients" with potent pharmacologic effects. For example, many antihistamines have significant sedative effects and are inherently more hazardous in patients with impaired cognitive function. Similarly, their antimuscarinic action may precipitate urinary retention in geriatric men or glaucoma in the patient with a narrow anterior chamber angle. If the patient is also taking a metabolism inhibitor such as cimetidine, the probability of an adverse reaction is greatly increased. A patient taking an herbal medication containing gingko is more likely to experience bleeding while taking low doses of aspirin.

\section*{PRACTI CAL ASPECTS OF GERI ATRI C PHARMACOLOGY}

The quality of life in elderly patients can be greatly improved and life span can be prolonged by the intelligent use of drugs. However, there are several practical obstacles to compliance that the prescriber must recognize.

The expense of drugs can be a major disincentive in patients receiving marginal retirement incomes who are not covered or inadequately covered by health insurance. The prescriber must be aware of the cost of the prescription and of cheaper alternative therapies. For example, the monthly cost of arthritis therapy with newer NSAIDs may exceed \$100, while that for generic aspirin is about \$5 and for ibuprofen, an older NSAID, about \$20.

Noncompliance may result from forgetfulness or confusion, especially if the patient has several prescriptions and different dosing intervals. A survey carried out in 1986 showed that the population over 65 years of age accounted for $32 \%$ of drugs prescribed in the USA, although these patients represented only $11-12 \%$ of the population at that time. Since the prescriptions are often written by several different practitioners, there is usually no attempt to design "integrated" regimens that use drugs with similar dosing intervals for the conditions being treated. Patients may forget instructions regarding the need to complete a fixed duration of therapy when a course of anti-infective drug is being given. The disappearance of symptoms is often regarded as the best reason to halt drug taking, especially if the prescription was expensive.

Noncompliance may also be deliberate. A decision not to take a drug may be based on prior experience with it. There may be excellent reasons for such "intelligent" noncompliance, and the practitioner should try to elicit them. Such efforts may also improve compliance with alternative drugs, because enlisting the patient as a participant in therapeutic decisions tends to increase the motivation to succeed.

Some errors in drug taking are caused by physical disabilities. Arthritis, tremor, and visual problems may all contribute. Liquid medications that are to be measured out "by the spoonful" are especially inappropriate for patients with any type of tremor or motor disability. The use of a pediatric dosing syringe may be helpful in such cases. Because of decreased production of saliva, older patients often have difficulty swallowing large tablets. "Childproof" containers are often "patient-proof" if the patient has arthritis. Cataracts and macular degeneration occur in a large number of patients over 70; therefore, labels on prescription bottles should be large enough for the patient with diminished vision to read, or color-coded if the patient can see but can no longer read.

Drug therapy has considerable potential for both helpful and harmful effects in the geriatric patient. The balance may be tipped in the right direction by adherence to a few principles:
(1) Take a careful drug history. The disease to be treated may be drug-induced, or drugs being taken may lead to interactions with drugs to be prescribed.
(2) Prescribe only for a specific and rational indication. Do not prescribe omeprazole for "dyspepsia."
(3) Define the goal of drug therapy. Then start with small doses and titrate to the response desired. Wait at least three half-lives (adjusted for age) before increasing the dose. If the expected response does not occur at the normal adult dosage, check blood levels. If the expected response does not occur at the appropriate blood level, switch to a different drug.
(4) Maintain a high index of suspicion regarding drug reactions and interactions. Know what other drugs the patient is taking.
(5) Simplify the regimen as much as possible. When multiple drugs are prescribed, try to use drugs that can be taken at the same time of day. Whenever possible, reduce the number of drugs being taken.

\section*{DERMATOLOGI C PHARMACOLOGY: I NTRODUCTION}

The skin offers a number of special opportunities to the clinician. For example, the topical route of administration is especially appropriate for diseases of the skin, although some dermatologic diseases respond as well or better to drugs administered systemically.

The general pharmacokinetic principles governing the use of drugs applied to the skin are the same as those involved in other routes of drug administration (see Chapters 1 and 3). Although often depicted as a simple three-layered structure, human skin is a complex series of diffusion barriers. Quantitation of the flux of drugs and drug vehicles through these barriers is the basis for pharmacokinetic analysis of dermatologic therapy, and techniques for making such measurements are rapidly increasing in number and sensitivity.

Major variables that determine pharmacologic response to drugs applied to the skin include the following:
(1) Regional variation in drug penetration: For example, the scrotum, face, axilla, and scalp are far more permeable than the forearm and may require less drug for equivalent effect.
(2) Concentration gradient: Increasing the concentration gradient increases the mass of drug transferred per unit time, just as in the case of diffusion across other barriers (see Chapter 1). Thus, resistance to topical corticosteroids can sometimes be overcome by use of higher concentrations of drug.
(3) Dosing schedule: Because of its physical properties, the skin acts as a reservoir for many drugs. As a result, the "local half-life" may be long enough to permit once-daily application of drugs with short systemic half-lives. For example, once-daily application of corticosteroids appears to be just as effective as multiple applications in many conditions.
(4) Vehicles and occlusion: An appropriate vehicle maximizes the ability of the drug to penetrate the outer layers of the skin. In addition, through their physical properties (moistening or drying effects), vehicles may themselves have important therapeutic effects. Occlusion (application of a plastic wrap to hold the drug and its vehicle in close contact with the skin) is extremely effective in maximizing efficacy.

\section*{DERMATOLOGI C VEHI CLES}

Topical medications usually consist of active ingredients incorporated in a vehicle that facilitates cutaneous application. Important considerations in selection of a vehicle include the solubility of the active agent in the vehicle; the rate of release of the agent from the vehicle; the ability of the vehicle to hydrate the stratum corneum, thus enhancing penetration; the stability of the therapeutic agent in the vehicle; and interactions, chemical and physical, of the vehicle, stratum corneum, and active agent.

Depending upon the vehicle, dermatologic formulations may be classified as tinctures, wet dressings, lotions, gels, aerosols, powders, pastes, creams, and ointments. The ability of the vehicle to retard evaporation from the surface of the skin increases in this series, being least in tinctures and wet dressings and greatest in ointments. In general, acute inflammation with oozing, vesiculation, and crusting is best treated with drying preparations such as tinctures, wet dressings, and lotions, whereas chronic inflammation with xerosis, scaling, and lichenification is best treated with more lubricating preparations such as creams and ointments. Tinctures, lotions, gels, and aerosols are convenient for application to the scalp and hairy areas. Emulsified vanishing-type creams may be used in intertriginous areas without causing maceration.

Emulsifying agents are used to provide homogeneous, stable preparations when mixtures of immiscible liquids such as oil-in-water creams are compounded. Some patients develop irritation from these agents. Substituting a preparation that does not contain them or using one containing a lower concentration may resolve the problem.

\section*{ANTI BACTERI AL AGENTS TOPI CAL ANTI BACTERI AL PREPARATI ONS}

Topical antibacterial agents may be useful in preventing infections in clean wounds, in the early treatment of infected dermatoses and wounds, in reducing colonization of the nares by staphylococci, in axillary deodorization, and in the management of acne vulgaris. The efficacy of antibiotics in these topical applications is not uniform. The general pharmacology of the antimicrobial drugs is discussed in Chapters 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, and 51.

Numerous topical anti-infectives contain corticosteroids in addition to antibiotics. There is no convincing evidence that topical corticosteroids inhibit the antibacterial effect of antibiotics when the two are incorporated in the same preparation. In the treatment of secondarily infected dermatoses, which are usually colonized with streptococci, staphylococci, or both, combination therapy may prove superior to corticosteroid therapy alone. Antibiotic-corticosteroid combinations may be useful in treating diaper dermatitis, otitis externa, and impetiginized eczema.

The selection of a particular antibiotic depends of course upon the diagnosis and, when appropriate, in vitro culture and sensitivity studies of clinical samples. The pathogens isolated from most infected dermatoses are group A B-hemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, or both. The pathogens present in surgical wounds will be those resident in the environment. Information about regional patterns of drug resistance is therefore important in selecting a therapeutic agent. Prepackaged topical antibacterial preparations that contain multiple antibiotics are available in fixed dosages well above the
therapeutic threshold. These formulations offer the advantages of efficacy in mixed infections, broader coverage for infections due to undetermined pathogens, and delayed microbial resistance to any single component antibiotic.

\section*{Bacitracin \& Gramicidin}

Bacitracin and gramicidin are peptide antibiotics, active against gram-positive organisms such as streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci. In addition, most anaerobic cocci, neisseriae, tetanus bacilli, and diphtheria bacilli are sensitive. Bacitracin is compounded in an ointment base alone or in combination with neomycin, polymyxin B, or both. The use of bacitracin in the anterior nares may temporarily decrease colonization by pathogenic staphylococci. Microbial resistance may develop following prolonged use. Bacitracin-induced contact urticaria syndrome, including anaphylaxis, occurs rarely. Allergic contact dermatitis occurs frequently. Bacitracin is poorly absorbed through the skin, so systemic toxicity is rare.

Gramicidin is available only for topical use, in combination with other antibiotics such as neomycin, polymyxin, bacitracin, and nystatin. Systemic toxicity limits this drug to topical use. The incidence of sensitization following topical application is exceedingly low in therapeutic concentrations.

\section*{Mupirocin}

Mupirocin (pseudomonic acid A) is structurally unrelated to other currently available topical antibacterial agents. Most gram-positive aerobic bacteria, including methicillin-resistant S aureus, are sensitive to mupirocin (see Chapter 50). It is effective in the treatment of impetigo caused by $S$ aureus and group A B-hemolytic streptococci.

Intranasal mupirocin in Bactroban Nasal ointment for eliminating nasal carriage of $S$ aureus may be associated with irritation of mucous membranes caused by the polyethylene glycol vehicle. Mupirocin is not appreciably absorbed systemically after topical application to intact skin.

\section*{Polymyxin B Sulfate}

Polymyxin B is a peptide antibiotic effective against gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, enterobacter, and klebsiella. Most strains of proteus and serratia are resistant, as are all gram-positive organisms. Topical preparations may be compounded in either a solution or ointment base. Numerous prepackaged antibiotic combinations containing polymyxin B are available. Detectable serum concentrations are difficult to achieve from topical application, but the total daily dose applied to denuded skin or open wounds should not exceed 200 mg in order to reduce the likelihood of neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Hypersensitivity to topically applied polymyxin B sulfate is uncommon.

\section*{Neomycin \& Gentamicin}

Neomycin and gentamicin are aminoglycoside antibiotics active against gram-negative organisms, including E coli, proteus, klebsiella, and enterobacter. Gentamicin generally shows greater activity against $P$ aeruginosa than neomycin. Gentamicin is also more active against staphylococci and group $A$ B-hemolytic streptococci. Widespread topical use of gentamicin, especially in a hospital environment, should be avoided to slow the appearance of gentamicin-resistant organisms.

Neomycin is available in numerous topical formulations, both alone and in combination with polymyxin,
bacitracin, and other antibiotics. It is also available as a sterile powder for topical use. Gentamicin is available as an ointment or cream.

Topical application of neomycin rarely results in detectable serum concentrations. However, in the case of gentamicin, serum concentrations of $1-18 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ are possible if the drug is applied in a watermiscible preparation to large areas of denuded skin, as in burned patients. Both drugs are watersoluble and are excreted primarily in the urine. Renal failure may permit the accumulation of these antibiotics, with possible nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and ototoxicity.

Neomycin frequently causes sensitization, particularly if applied to eczematous dermatoses or if compounded in an ointment vehicle. When sensitization occurs, cross-sensitivity to streptomycin, kanamycin, paromomycin, and gentamicin is possible.

\section*{Topical Antibiotics in Acne}

Several systemic antibiotics that have traditionally been used in the treatment of acne vulgaris have been shown to be effective when applied topically. Currently, four antibiotics are so utilized: clindamycin phosphate, erythromycin base, metronidazole, and sulfacetamide. The effectiveness of topical therapy is less than that achieved by systemic administration of the same antibiotic. Therefore, topical therapy is generally suitable in mild to moderate cases of inflammatory acne.

\section*{Clindamycin}

Clindamycin has in vitro activity against Propionibacterium acnes; this has been postulated as the mechanism of its beneficial effect in acne therapy. Approximately $10 \%$ of an applied dose is absorbed, and rare cases of bloody diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported following topical application. The hydroalcoholic vehicle and foam formulation (Evoclin) may cause drying and irritation of the skin, with complaints of burning and stinging. The water-based gel and lotion formulations are well tolerated and less likely to cause irritation. Allergic contact dermatitis is uncommon. Clindamycin is also available in a fixed-combination topical gel with benzoyl peroxide (BenzaClin, Duac).

\section*{Erythromycin}

In topical preparations, the base of erythromycin rather than a salt is used to facilitate penetration. Although the mechanism of action of topical erythromycin in inflammatory acne vulgaris is unknown, it is presumed to be due to its inhibitory effects on P acnes. One of the possible complications of topical therapy is the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of organisms, including staphylococci. If this occurs in association with a clinical infection, topical erythromycin should be discontinued and appropriate systemic antibiotic therapy started. Adverse local reactions to erythromycin solution may include a burning sensation at the time of application and drying and irritation of the skin. The topical water-based gel is less drying and may be better-tolerated. Allergic hypersensitivity appears to be uncommon. Erythromycin is also available in a fixed combination preparation with benzoyl peroxide (Benzamycin) for topical treatment of acne vulgaris.

\section*{Metronidazole}

Topical metronidazole is effective in the treatment of acne rosacea. The mechanism of action is unknown, but it may relate to the inhibitory effects of metronidazole on Demodex brevis or as an antiinflammatory agent by direct effect on neutrophil cellular function. Oral metronidazole has been shown to be a carcinogen in susceptible rodent species, and topical use during pregnancy and by nursing
mothers and children is therefore not recommended.
Adverse local effects of the water-based gel formulation (MetroGel) include dryness, burning, and stinging. Less drying formulations may be better-tolerated (MetroCream, MetroLotion, and Noritate cream). Caution should be exercised when applying metronidazole near the eyes to avoid excessive tearing.
