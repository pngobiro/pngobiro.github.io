                    <p>Heart failure occurs when cardiac output is inadequate to provide the oxygen needed by the body. It is a highly lethal condition, with a 5 -year mortality rate conventionally said to be about 50%. The most common cause of heart failure in the USA is coronary artery disease. Two major types of failure may be distinguished. In systolic failure, the mechanical pumping action (contractility) and the ejection fraction of the heart are reduced. In diastolic failure stiffening and loss of adequate relaxation plays a major role in reducing cardiac output and ejection fraction may be normal. Because other cardiovascular conditions are now being treated more effectively (especially myocardial infarction), more patients are surviving long enough for heart failure to develop, making this one of the cardiovascular conditions that is actually increasing in prevalence.</p>

                     <p>Clinical research has shown that therapy directed at noncardiac targets is more valuable in the long-term treatment of heart failure than traditional positive inotropic agents (cardiac glycosides [digitalis]). Careful clinical trials have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, Bblockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and combined hydralazine-nitrate therapy are the only agents in current use that actually prolong life in patients with chronic heart failure. Positive inotropic drugs, on the other hand, can be very helpful in acute failure. They also reduce symptoms in chronic failure.</p>

                            <p>The vigor of contraction of heart muscle is determined by several processes that lead to the movement of actin and myosin filaments in the cardiac sarcomere (Figure 13-1). Ultimately, contraction results from the interaction of activator calcium (during systole) with the actin-troponin-tropomyosin system, thereby releasing the actin-myosin interaction. This calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The amount released depends on the amount stored in the SR and on the amount of trigger calcium that enters the cell during the plateau of the action potential.</p>

                            <p>Heart failure is a syndrome with multiple causes that may involve the right ventricle, the left ventricle, or both. Cardiac output in heart failure is usually below the normal range. Systolic dysfunction, with reduced cardiac output and significantly reduced ejection fraction (<45%), is typical of acute failure, especially that resulting from myocardial infarction. Diastolic dysfunction often occurs as a result of hypertrophy and stiffening of the myocardium, and although cardiac output is reduced, ejection fraction may be normal. Heart failure due to diastolic dysfunction does not usually respond optimally to positive inotropic drugs.</p>
                            <p>Rarely, "high-output" failure may occur. In this condition, the demands of the body are so great that even increased cardiac output is insufficient. High-output failure can result from hyperthyroidism, beriberi, anemia, and arteriovenous shunts. This form of failure responds poorly to the drugs discussed in this chapter and should be treated by correcting the underlying cause.</p>
                            <p>The primary signs and symptoms of all types of heart failure include tachycardia, decreased exercise tolerance, shortness of breath, peripheral and pulmonary edema, and cardiomegaly. Decreased exercise tolerance with rapid muscular fatigue is the major direct consequence of diminished cardiac output. The other manifestations result from the attempts by the body to compensate for the intrinsic cardiac defect.</p>

                            <p>Neurohumoral (extrinsic) compensation involves two major mechanisms previously presented in Figure 6-7: the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone hormonal response. Some of the pathologic as well as beneficial features of these compensatory responses are illustrated in Figure 13-2. The baroreceptor reflex appears to be reset, with a lower sensitivity to arterial pressure, in patients with heart failure. As a result, baroreceptor sensory input to the vasomotor center is reduced even at normal pressures; sympathetic outflow is increased, and parasympathetic outflow is decreased. Increased sympathetic outflow causes tachycardia, increased cardiac contractility, and increased vascular tone.</p>

                             <p>Some compensatory responses that occur during congestive heart failure. In addition to the effects shown, angiotensin II increases sympathetic effects by facilitating norepinephrine release.</p>
                             <p>While the increased preload, force, and heart rate initially increase cardiac output, increased arterial tone results in increased afterload and decreased ejection fraction, cardiac output, and renal perfusion. After a
                                 relatively short time, complex down-regulatory changes in the $B_{1}$-adrenoceptor‚ÄîG protein-effector system take place that result in diminished stimulatory effects. Beta ${}_{2}$ receptors are not down-regulated and may develop increased coupling to the I P ${}_{3}$-DAG cascade. It has also been suggested that cardiac $B_{3}$ receptors (which do not appear to be down-regulated in failure) may mediate negative inotropic effects. Excessive beta activation can lead to leakage of calcium from the SR via RyR2 channels and contributes to stiffening of the ventricles and arrhythmias. Increased angiotensin II production leads to increased aldosterone secretion (with sodium and water retention), to increased afterload, and to remodeling of both heart and vessels (discussed below). Other hormones may also be released, including natriuretic peptide and endothelin (see Chapter 17).</p>
                             <p>The most important intrinsic compensatory mechanism is myocardial hypertrophy. This increase in muscle mass helps maintain cardiac performance. However, after an initial beneficial effect, hypertrophy can lead to ischemic changes, impairment of diastolic filling, and alterations in ventricular geometry.
                                 Remodeling is the term applied to dilation (other than that due to passive stretch) and other slow structural changes that occur in the stressed myocardium. It may include proliferation of connective tissue cells as well as abnormal myocardial cells with some biochemical characteristics of fetal myocytes. Ultimately, myocytes in the failing heart die at an accelerated rate through apoptosis, leaving the remaining myocytes subject to even greater stress.</p>
                             <p>The severity of heart failure is usually described according to a scale devised by the New York Heart Association. Class I failure is associated with no limitations on ordinary activities and symptoms that occur only with greater than ordinary exercise. Class II is characterized by slight limitation of ordinary activities, which result in fatigue and palpitations with ordinary physical activity. Class III failure results in no symptoms at rest, but fatigue, etc, with less than ordinary physical activity. Class IV is associated with symptoms even when the patient is at rest.</p>

                            <p>Cardiac performance is a function of four primary factors:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">

                                    <span class="item-text">(1) Preload: When some measure of left ventricular performance such as stroke volume or stroke work is plotted as a function of left ventricular filling pressure or end-diastolic fiber length, the resulting curve is termed the left ventricular function curve (Figure 13-3). The ascending limb (<15 mm Hg filling pressure) represents the classic Frank-Starling relation. Beyond approximately 15 mm Hg , there is a plateau of performance. Preloads greater than 20-25 mm Hg result in pulmonary congestion. As noted above, preload is usually increased in heart failure because of increased blood volume and venous tone. Because the curve of the failing heart is lower, the plateau is reached at much lower values of stroke work or output. Increased fiber length or filling pressure increases oxygen demand in the myocardium. Reduction of high filling pressure is the goal of salt restriction and diuretic therapy in heart failure. Venodilator drugs (eg, nitroglycerin) also reduce preload by redistributing blood away from the chest into peripheral veins.</span>
                                </li>

                                    <span class="item-text">(2) Afterload: Afterload is the resistance against which the heart must pump blood and is represented by aortic impedance and systemic vascular resistance. As cardiac output falls in chronic failure, there is a reflex increase in systemic vascular resistance, mediated in part by increased sympathetic outflow and circulating catecholamines and in part by activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Endothelin, a potent
                                        vasoconstrictor peptide, may also be involved. This sets the stage for the use of drugs that reduce arteriolar tone in heart failure.</span>

                                    <span class="item-text">(3) Contractility: Heart muscle obtained by biopsy from patients with chronic low-output failure demonstrates a reduction in intrinsic contractility. As contractility decreases in the patient, there is a reduction in the velocity of muscle shortening, the rate of intraventricular pressure development (dP/dt), and the stroke output achieved (Figure 13-3). However, the heart is still capable of some increase in all of these measures of contractility in response to inotropic drugs.</span>

                                    <span class="item-text">(4) Heart rate: The heart rate is a major determinant of cardiac output. As the intrinsic function of the heart decreases in failure and stroke volume diminishes, an increase in heart rate‚Äîthrough sympathetic activation of Badrenoceptors‚Äîis the first compensatory mechanism that comes into play to maintain cardiac output.</span>

The increase in calcium concentration is the result of a two-step process: first, an increase of intracellular sodium concentration because of $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ ATPase inhibition (1 in Figure 13-1); and second, a relative reduction of calcium expulsion from the cell by the sodium-calcium exchanger (NaxC in Figure 13-1) caused by the increase in intracellular sodium.

                                                  <p>At higher concentrations, resting membrane potential is reduced (made less negative) as a result of inhibition of the sodium pump and reduced intracellular potassium. As toxicity progresses, oscillatory depolarizing afterpotentials appear following normally evoked action potentials (Figure 13-4, panel B). The afterpotentials (also known as delayed afterdepolarizations, DADs ) are associated with overloading of the intracellular calcium stores and oscillations in the free intracellular calcium ion concentration. When afterpotentials reach threshold, they elicit action potentials (premature depolarizations or ectopic "beats") that are coupled to the preceding normal action potentials. If afterpotentials in the Purkinje conducting
                                                      system regularly reach threshold in this way, bigeminy will be recorded on the electrocardiogram (Figure 13-5). With further intoxication, each afterpotential-evoked action potential will itself elicit a suprathreshold afterpotential, and a self-sustaining tachycardia will be established. If allowed to progress, such a tachycardia may deteriorate into fibrillation; in the case of ventricular fibrillation, the arrhythmia will be rapidly fatal unless corrected.</p>

                                                  <p>Autonomic actions of cardiac glycosides on the heart involve both the parasympathetic and the sympathetic systems. In the lower portion of the dose range, cardioselective parasympathomimetic effects predominate. In fact, these atropine-blockable effects account for a significant portion of the early electrical effects of digitalis (Table 13-2). This action involves sensitization of the baroreceptors, central vagal stimulation, and facilitation of muscarinic transmission at the cardiac muscle cell. Because cholinergic innervation is much richer in the atria, these actions affect atrial and atrioventricular nodal function more than Purkinje or ventricular function. Some of the cholinomimetic effects are useful in the treatment of certain arrhythmias. At toxic levels, sympathetic outflow is increased by digitalis. This effect is not essential for typical digitalis toxicity but sensitizes the myocardium and exaggerates all the toxic effects of the drug.</p>
                                                  <p>The most common cardiac manifestations of digitalis toxicity include atrioventricular junctional rhythm, premature ventricular depolarizations, bigeminal rhythm, and second-degree atrioventricular blockade. However, it is claimed that digitalis can cause virtually any arrhythmia.</p>

                                         <p>Potassium and digitalis interact in two ways. First, they inhibit each other's binding to $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ ATPase; therefore, hyperkalemia reduces the enzyme-inhibiting actions of cardiac glycosides, whereas hypokalemia facilitates these actions. Second, abnormal cardiac automaticity is inhibited by hyperkalemia (see Chapter 14). Moderately increased extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$therefore reduces the effects of digitalis, especially the toxic effects.</p>
                                        <p>Calcium ion facilitates the toxic actions of cardiac glycosides by accelerating the overloading of intracellular calcium stores that appears to be responsible for digitalis-induced abnormal automaticity. Hypercalcemia therefore increases the risk of a digitalis-induced arrhythmia. The effects of magnesium ion appear to be opposite to those of calcium. These interactions mandate careful evaluation of serum electrolytes in patients with digitalis-induced arrhythmias.</p>

Levosimendan, an investigational drug that sensitizes the troponin system to calcium, also appears to inhibit phosphodiesterase and cause some vasodilation in addition to its inotropic effects. Some early clinical trials suggest that this drug may be useful in patients with heart failure. A group of B-adrenoceptor stimulants has also been used as digitalis substitutes, but they may increase mortality (see below).</p>

Spironolactone and eplerenone, the aldosterone antagonist diuretics (see Chapter 15), have the additional benefit of decreasing morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure who are also receiving ACE inhibitors and other standard therapy.

                                     <p>A synthetic form of the endogenous peptide brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is approved for use in acute cardiac failure as nesiritide. This recombinant product increases cGMP in smooth muscle cells and reduces venous and arteriolar tone in experimental preparations. It also causes diuresis. The peptide has a short half-life of about 18 minutes and is administered as a bolus intravenous dose followed by continuous
                                         infusion. Excessive hypotension is the most common adverse effect. Reports of significant renal damage and deaths have resulted in application of extra warnings regarding this agent and it should be used with great caution.</p>
                                     <p>Measurement of endogenous BNP has been proposed as a diagnostic test because plasma concentrations rise in most patients with heart failure.</p>
                                     <p>Bosentan, an orally active competitive inhibitor of endothelin (see Chapter 17), has been shown to have some benefits in experimental animal models of heart failure, but results in human trials have been disappointing. This drug is approved for use in pulmonary hypertension (see Chapter 11). It has significant teratogenic and hepatotoxic effects.</p>

In mild failure, it is reasonable to start with a thiazide diuretic, switching to agents such as furosemide as required. Sodium loss causes secondary loss of potassium, which is particularly hazardous if the patient is to be given digitalis. Hypokalemia can be treated with potassium supplementation or through the addition of an ACE inhibitor or a potassium-sparing diuretic such as spironolactone. As noted above, spironolactone or eplerenone should probably be considered in all patients with moderate or severe heart failure since they appear to reduce both morbidity and mortality. Serum potassium should be monitored in patients receiving any of these agents.</p>

                                     <p>In patients with left ventricular dysfunction but no edema, an ACE inhibitor should be used first. Several large studies have compared ACE inhibitors with digoxin or with other traditional therapies for chronic heart failure. The results show clearly that ACE inhibitors are superior to both placebo and to vasodilators and must be considered, along with diuretics, as first-line therapy for chronic failure. However, ACE inhibitors cannot replace digoxin in patients already receiving that drug because patients withdrawn from the cardiac glycoside deteriorate while on ACE inhibitor therapy.</p>
                                     <p>By reducing preload and afterload in asymptomatic patients, ACE inhibitors appear to slow the progress of ventricular dilation and thus delay the onset of clinical heart failure. Thus, ACE inhibitors are beneficial in all subsets of patients, from those who are asymptomatic to those in severe chronic failure. This benefit appears to be a class effect, ie, all ACE inhibitors appear to be effective.</p>
                                     <p>The angiotensin II $AT_{1}$ receptor blockers (ARBs, eg, losartan, candesartan, etc) appear to have similar but more limited beneficial effects. Angiotensin receptor blockers should be considered in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors. In some trials, candesartan was beneficial when added to an ACE inhibitor.</p>

                                     <p>Vasodilator drugs can be divided into selective arteriolar dilators, venous dilators, and drugs with nonselective vasodilatory effects. For this purpose, the ACE inhibitors may be considered nonselective arteriolar and venous dilators. The choice of agent should be based on the patient's signs and symptoms and hemodynamic measurements. Thus, in patients with high filling pressures in whom the principal symptom is dyspnea, venous dilators such as long-acting nitrates will be most helpful in reducing filling pressures and the symptoms of pulmonary congestion. In patients in whom fatigue due to low left ventricular output is a primary symptom, an arteriolar dilator such as hydralazine may be helpful in increasing forward cardiac output. In most patients with severe chronic failure that responds poorly to other therapy, the problem usually involves both elevated filling pressures and reduced cardiac output. In these
                                         circumstances, dilation of both arterioles and veins is required. In a trial in African-American patients already receiving ACE inhibitors, addition of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate reduced mortality.</p>

                                     <p>Trials of B-blocker therapy in patients with heart failure are based on the hypothesis that excessive tachycardia and adverse effects of high catecholamine levels on the heart contribute to the downward course of heart failure patients. The results clearly indicate that such therapy is beneficial if initiated very cautiously at low doses, even though acutely blocking the supportive effects of catecholamines can worsen heart failure. Several months of therapy may be required before improvement is noted; this usually consists of a slight rise in ejection fraction, slower heart rate, and reduction in symptoms.

                                     <p>Digoxin is indicated in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. It is also most helpful in patients with a dilated heart and third heart sound. It is usually given only if diuretics and ACE inhibitors have failed to control symptoms. Only about 50% of patients with normal sinus rhythm (usually those with documented systolic dysfunction) will have documentable relief of heart failure from digitalis. Better results are obtained in patients with atrial fibrillation. If the decision is made to use a cardiac glycoside, digoxin is the one chosen in the great majority of cases (and the only one available in the USA). When symptoms are mild, slow loading (digitalization) with 0.125-0.25 mg per day is safer and just as effective as the rapid method (0.5-0.75 mg every 8 hours for 3 doses, followed by 0.125-0.25 mg per day).</p>
                                     <p>Determining the optimal level of digitalis effect may be difficult. In patients with atrial fibrillation, reduction of ventricular rate is the best measure of glycoside effect. In patients in normal sinus rhythm, symptomatic improvement and reductions in heart size, heart rate during exercise, venous pressure, or edema may signify optimum drug levels in the myocardium. Unfortunately, toxic effects may occur before the therapeutic end point is detected. If digitalis is being loaded slowly, simple omission of one dose and halving the maintenance dose will often bring the patient to the narrow range between suboptimal and toxic concentrations. Measurement of plasma digoxin levels is useful in patients who appear unusually resistant or sensitive; a level of 1 ng/mL or less is appropriate.</p>
                                     <p>Because it has a moderate but persistent positive inotropic effect, digitalis can, in theory, reverse all the signs and symptoms of heart failure. Although the drug has no net effect on mortality, it reduces hospitalization and deaths from progressive heart failure at the expense of an increase in sudden death. It is important to note that the mortality rate is reduced in patients with serum digoxin concentrations of less than 0.9 ng/mL but increased in those with digoxin levels greater than 1.5 ng/mL.</p>

                                     <p>Digitalis is useful in the management of atrial arrhythmias because of its cardioselective parasympathomimetic effects. In atrial flutter and fibrillation, the depressant effect of the drug on atrioventricular conduction will help control an excessively high ventricular rate. Digitalis has also been used in the control of paroxysmal atrial and atrioventricular nodal tachycardia. At present, calcium channel blockers and adenosine are preferred for this application.</p>
                                     <p>Digitalis should be avoided in the therapy of arrhythmias associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome because it increases the probability of conduction of arrhythmic atrial impulses through the alternative rapidly conducting atrioventricular pathway.

                                     <p>In spite of its limited benefits and recognized hazards, digitalis is still heavily used and toxicity is common. Therapy of toxicity manifested as visual changes or gastrointestinal disturbances generally requires no more than reducing the dose of the drug. If cardiac arrhythmia is present and can definitely be ascribed to digitalis, more vigorous therapy may be necessary. Serum digitalis and potassium levels and the electrocardiogram should always be monitored during therapy of significant digitalis toxicity. Electrolyte status should be corrected if abnormal (see above).</p>
                                     <p>In severe digitalis intoxication, serum potassium will already be elevated at the time of diagnosis (because of potassium loss from the intracellular compartment of skeletal muscle and other tissues). Furthermore, automaticity is usually depressed, and antiarrhythmic agents administered in this setting may lead to cardiac arrest. Such patients are best treated with prompt insertion of a temporary cardiac pacemaker catheter and administration of digitalis antibodies (digoxin immune fab). These antibodies recognize digitoxin and cardiac glycosides from many other plants in addition to digoxin. They are extremely useful in reversing severe intoxication with most glycosides.</p>
                                     <p>Digitalis-induced arrhythmias are frequently made worse by cardioversion; this therapy should be reserved for ventricular fibrillation if the arrhythmia is glycoside-induced.</p>

                             <p>Patients with normal sinus rhythm and a wide QRS interval have some dyssynchronization of ventricular contraction. Poor synchronization of left ventricular contraction results in diminished cardiac output. Resynchronization, with left ventricular or biventricular pacing, has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with chronic heart failure who were already receiving optimal medical therapy.</p>

                             <p>Acute heart failure occurs frequently in patients with chronic failure. Such episodes are usually associated with increased exertion, emotion, salt in the diet, noncompliance with medical therapy, or increased metabolic demand occasioned by fever, anemia, etc. A particularly common and important cause of acute failure‚Äîwith or without chronic failure‚Äîis acute myocardial infarction.</p>
                            <p>Patients with acute myocardial infarction are best treated with emergency revascularization using either coronary angioplasty and a stent or a thrombolytic agent. Even with revascularization, acute failure may develop in such patients. Many of the signs and symptoms of acute and chronic failure are identical, but their therapies diverge because of the need for more rapid response and the relatively greater frequency and severity of pulmonary vascular congestion in the acute form.</p>
                            <p>Measurements of arterial pressure, cardiac output, stroke work index, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure are particularly useful in patients with acute myocardial infarction and acute heart failure. Such patients can be usefully characterized on the basis of three hemodynamic measurements: arterial pressure, left ventricular filling pressure, and cardiac index. One such classification and therapies that have proved most effective are set forth in Table 13-4. When filling pressure is greater than 15 mm Hg and stroke work
                                index is less than 20 gm/m${}^{2}$, the mortality rate is high. Intermediate levels of these two variables imply a much better prognosis.</p>

                             <p>Among patients with acute decompensation, a small subset is found to have hyponatremia, presumably due to increased vasopressin activity. A new $\mathrm{V}_{1\mathrm{a}}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{2}$ receptor antagonist, conivaptan, has recently been approved for the parenteral treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia. Several clinical trials have indicated that this drug and related $\mathrm{V}_{2}$ antagonists may have a beneficial effect in some patients with acute heart failure and hyponatremia.</p>
