\section*{Mechanism of Action}

The antifungal activity of azole drugs results from the reduction of ergosterol synthesis by inhibition of fungal cytochrome P450 enzymes. The specificity of azole drugs results from their greater affinity for fungal than for human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Imidazoles exhibit a lesser degree of specificity than the triazoles, accounting for their higher incidence of drug interactions and side effects.

Resistance to azoles occurs via multiple mechanisms. Once rare, increasing numbers of resistant strains are being reported, suggesting that increasing use of these agents for prophylaxis and therapy may be selecting for clinical drug resistance in certain settings.

\section*{Clinical Use}

The spectrum of action of azole medications is broad, ranging from many candida species, Cryptococcus neoformans, the endemic mycoses (blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis), the dermatophytes, and, in the case of itraconazole and voriconazole, even aspergillus infections. They are also useful in the treatment of intrinsically amphotericin-resistant organisms such as Pseudallescheria boydii.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

As a group, the azoles are relatively nontoxic. The most common adverse reaction is relatively minor gastrointestinal upset. All azoles have been reported to cause abnormalities in liver enzymes and, very rarely, clinical hepatitis. Adverse effects specific to individual agents are discussed below.

\section*{Drug I nteractions}

All azole drugs affect the mammalian cytochrome P450 system of enzymes to some extent, and consequently they are prone to drug interactions. The most significant reactions are indicated below.

\section*{Ketoconazole}

Ketoconazole was the first oral azole introduced into clinical use. It is distinguished from triazoles by its greater propensity to inhibit mammalian cytochrome P450 enzymes; that is, it is less selective for fungal P450 than are the newer azoles. As a result, systemic ketoconazole has fallen out of clinical use in the USA and is not discussed in any detail here. Its dermatologic use is discussed in Chapter 62.

\section*{I traconazole}

Itraconazole is available in oral and intravenous formulations and is used at a dosage of $100-400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. Drug absorption is increased by food and by low gastric pH. Like other lipid-soluble azoles, it interacts with hepatic microsomal enzymes, though to a lesser degree than ketoconazole. An important drug interaction is reduced bioavailability of itraconazole when taken with rifamycins (rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine). It does not affect mammalian steroid synthesis, and its effects on the metabolism of other hepatically cleared medications are much less than those of ketoconazole. While itraconazole displays potent antifungal
activity, effectiveness can be limited by reduced bioavailability. Newer formulations, including an oral liquid and an intravenous preparation, have utilized cyclodextran as a carrier molecule to enhance solubility and bioavailability. Like ketoconazole, it penetrates poorly into the cerebrospinal fluid. Itraconazole is the azole of choice for treatment of disease due to the dimorphic fungi histoplasma, blastomyces, and sporothrix. Itraconazole has activity against aspergillus species, but it has been replaced by voriconazole as the azole of choice for aspergillosis. Itraconazole is used extensively in the treatment of dermatophytoses and onychomycosis.

\section*{Fluconazole}

Fluconazole displays a high degree of water solubility and good cerebrospinal fluid penetration. Unlike ketoconazole and itraconazole, its oral bioavailability is high. Drug interactions are also less common because fluconazole has the least effect of all the azoles on hepatic microsomal enzymes. Because of fewer hepatic enzyme interactions and better gastrointestinal tolerance, fluconazole has the widest therapeutic index of the azoles, permitting more aggressive dosing in a variety of fungal infections. The drug is available in oral and intravenous formulations and is used at a dosage of $100-800 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$.

Fluconazole is the azole of choice in the treatment and secondary prophylaxis of cryptococcal meningitis. Intravenous fluconazole has been shown to be equivalent to amphotericin B in treatment of candidemia in ICU patients with normal white blood cell counts. Fluconazole is the agent most commonly used for the treatment of mucocutaneous candidiasis. Activity against the dimorphic fungi is limited to coccidioidal disease, and in particular for meningitis, where high doses of fluconazole often obviate the need for intrathecal amphotericin B. Fluconazole displays no activity against aspergillus or other filamentous fungi.

Prophylactic use of fluconazole has been demonstrated to reduce fungal disease in bone marrow transplant recipients and AIDS patients, but the emergence of fluconazole-resistant fungi has raised concerns about this indication.

\section*{Voriconazole}

Voriconazole is the newest triazole to be licensed in the USA. It is available in intravenous and oral formulations. The recommended dosage is $400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. The drug is well absorbed orally, with a bioavailability exceeding $90 \%$, and it exhibits less protein binding than itraconazole. Metabolism is predominantly hepatic, but the propensity for inhibition of mammalian P450 appears to be low. Observed toxicities include rash and elevated hepatic enzymes. Visual disturbances are common, occurring in up to $30 \%$ of patients receiving voriconazole, and include blurring and changes in color vision or brightness. These visual changes usually occur immediately after a dose of voriconazole and resolve within 30 minutes.

Voriconazole is similar to itraconazole in its spectrum of action, having excellent activity against candida species (including fluconazole-resistant species such as C krusei) and the dimorphic fungi. Voriconazole is less toxic than amphotericin B and is probably more effective in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.

\section*{ECHI NOCANDI NS}

Echinocandins are the newest class of antifungal agent to be developed. They are large cyclic peptides linked to a long-chain fatty acid. Caspofungin,micafungin, and anidulafungin are the only licensed agents in this category of antifungals, although other drugs are under active investigation. These agents are active against both candida and aspergillus, but not Cryptococcus neoformans .

\section*{Pharmacology}

Echinocandins are available only in intravenous forms. Caspofungin is administered as a single loading dose of 70 mg , followed by a daily dose of 50 mg . Caspofungin is water-soluble and highly protein-bound. The half-life is $9-11$ hours, and the metabolites are excreted by the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Dosage adjustments are required only in the presence of severe hepatic insufficiency. Micafungin displays similar properties with a half-life of 11-15 hours and is used at a dose of $150 \mathrm{mg} /$ day for treatment and $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ for prophylaxis of fungal infections. Anidulafungin has a half-life of 24-48 hours. For esophageal candidiasis, it is administered intravenously at 100 mg on the first day and $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ thereafter for 14 days. For systemic candidemia, a loading dose of 200 mg is recommended with $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ thereafter for at least 14 days after the last positive blood culture.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Echinocandins act at the level of the fungal cell wall by inhibiting the synthesis of $B(1-3)$ glucan. This results in disruption of the fungal cell wall and cell death.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Echinocandin agents are extremely well tolerated, with minor gastrointestinal side effects and flushing reported infrequently. Elevated liver enzymes have been noted in several patients receiving caspofungin in combination with cyclosporine, and this combination should be avoided. Micafungin has been shown to increase levels of nifedipine, cyclosporine, and sirolimus. Anidulafungin does not seem to have significant drug interactions, but histamine release may occur during IV infusion.

\section*{Clinical Use}

Caspofungin is currently licensed for disseminated and mucocutaneous candida infections, as well as for empiric antifungal therapy during febrile neutropenia. Note that caspofungin is licensed for use in invasive aspergillosis only as salvage therapy in patients who have failed to respond to amphotericin B, and not as primary therapy. Micafungin is licensed only for mucocutaneous candidiasis and prophylaxis of candida infections in bone marrow transplant patients. Anidulafungin is approved for use in esophageal candidiasis and invasive candidiasis, including septicemia.

\section*{SYSTEMI C ANTI FUNGAL DRUGS FOR MUCOCUTANEOUS INFECTIONS GRI SEOFULVI N}

Griseofulvin is a very insoluble fungistatic drug derived from a species of penicillium. Its only use is in the systemic treatment of dermatophytosis (see Chapter 62). It is administered in a microcrystalline form at a dosage of $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$. Absorption is improved when it is given with fatty foods. Griseofulvin's mechanism of action at the cellular level is unclear, but it is deposited in newly forming skin where it binds to keratin, protecting the skin from new infection. Because its action is to prevent infection of these new skin structures, griseofulvin must be administered for 2-6 weeks for skin and hair infections to allow the replacement of infected keratin by the resistant structures. Nail infections may require therapy for months to allow regrowth of the new protected nail and is often followed by relapse. Adverse effects include an allergic syndrome much like serum sickness, hepatitis, and drug interactions with warfarin and phenobarbital. Griseofulvin has been largely replaced by newer antifungal medications such as itraconazole and terbinafine.

\section*{TERBI NAFI NE}

Terbinafine is a synthetic allylamine that is available in an oral formulation and is used at a dosage of 250 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. It is used in the treatment of dermatophytoses, especially onychomycosis (see Chapter 62). Like griseofulvin, terbinafine is a keratophilic medication, but unlike griseofulvin, it is fungicidal. Like the azole drugs, it interferes with ergosterol biosynthesis, but rather than interacting with the P450 system, terbinafine inhibits the fungal enzyme squalene epoxidase. This leads to the accumulation of the sterol squalene, which is toxic to the organism. One tablet given daily for 12 weeks achieves a cure rate of up to $90 \%$ for onychomycosis and is more effective than griseofulvin or itraconazole. Adverse effects are rare, consisting primarily of gastrointestinal upset and headache. Terbinafine does not seem to affect the P450 system and has demonstrated no significant drug interactions to date.

\section*{TOPI CAL ANTI FUNGAL THERAPY NYSTATI N}

Nystatin is a polyene macrolide much like amphotericin B. It is too toxic for parenteral administration and is only used topically. Nystatin is currently available in creams, ointments, suppositories, and other forms for application to skin and mucous membranes. It is not absorbed to a significant degree from skin, mucous membranes, or the gastrointestinal tract. As a result, nystatin has little toxicity, although oral use is often limited by the unpleasant taste.

Nystatin is active against most candida species and is most commonly used for suppression of local candidal infections. Some common indications include oropharyngeal thrush, vaginal candidiasis, and intertriginous candidal infections.

\section*{TOPI CAL AZOLES}

The two azoles most commonly used topically are clotrimazole and miconazole; several others are available (see Preparations Available). Both are available over-the-counter and are often used for vulvovaginal candidiasis. Oral clotrimazole troches are available for treatment of oral thrush and are a pleasant-tasting alternative to nystatin. In cream form, both agents are useful for dermatophytic infections, including tinea corporis, tinea pedis, and tinea cruris. Absorption is negligible, and adverse effects are rare.

Topical and shampoo forms of ketoconazole are also available and useful in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis and pityriasis versicolor. Several other azoles are available for topical use (see Preparations Available).

\section*{TOPI CAL ALLYLAMI NES}

Terbinafine and naftifine are allylamines available as topical creams (see Chapter 62). Both are effective for treatment of tinea cruris and tinea corporis. These are prescription drugs in the USA.

\section*{ANTI VI RAL AGENTS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites; their replication depends primarily on synthetic processes of the hos cell. Therefore, to be effective, antiviral agents must either block viral entry into or exit from the cell or be activ inside the host cell. As a corollary, nonselective inhibitors of virus replication may interfere with host cell functic and produce toxicity.

Progress in antiviral chemotherapy began in the early 1950s, when the search for anticancer drugs generated
several new compounds capable of inhibiting viral DNA synthesis. The two first-generation antivirals, 5iododeoxyuridine and trifluorothymidine, had poor specificity (ie, they inhibited host cell DNA as well as viral DN that rendered them too toxic for systemic use. However, both agents are effective when used topically for the treatment of herpes keratitis.

Recent research has focused on the identification of agents with greater selectivity, in vivo stability, and lack of toxicity. Selective antiretroviral agents that inhibit a critical HIV-1 enzyme such as reverse transcriptase or the protease required for final packaging of the virus particle have become available. However, because replication the virus peaks at or before the manifestation of clinical symptoms in many viral infections, chemoprophylaxis c early initiation of therapy may be key. In chronic illnesses such as viral hepatitis or HIV infection, potent inhibiti of viral replication is crucial in limiting the extent of systemic damage.

Viral replication consists of several steps (Figure 49-1): (1) attachment of the virus to the host cell; (2) entry o the virus through the host cell membrane; (3) uncoating of viral nucleic acid; (4) synthesis of early regulatory proteins, eg, nucleic acid polymerases; (5) synthesis of RNA or DNA; (6) synthesis of late, structural proteins; ( assembly (maturation) of viral particles; and (8) release from the cell. Antiviral agents can potentially target an of these steps.

\section*{AGENTS TO TREAT HERPES SI MPLEX VI RUS (HSV) \& VARI CELLA-ZOSTEI VI RUS (VZV) I NFECTI ONS}

Three oral nucleoside analogs are licensed for the treatment of HSV and VZV infections: acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. They have similar mechanisms of action and similar indications for clinical use; all are well tolerated. Acyclovir has been the most extensively studied; it was licensed first and is the only one of the three available for intravenous use in the United States. Comparative trials have demonstrated similar efficacies of these three agents for the treatment of HSV but modest superiority of famciclovir and valacyclovir over acyclov for the treatment of herpes zoster. Neither valacyclovir nor famciclovir have been fully evaluated in pediatric patients; thus, neither is indicated for the treatment of varicella infection.

\section*{ACYCLOVI R}

Acyclovir (Figure 49-2) is an acyclic guanosine derivative with clinical activity against HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV. | vitro activity against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) is present but comparatively weaker.

Chemical structures of some antiviral nucleoside and nucleotide analogs.

Acyclovir requires three phosphorylation steps for activation. It is converted first to the monophosphate derivat
by the virus-specified thymidine kinase and then to the di- and triphosphate compounds by host cell enzymes (Figure 49-3). Because it requires the viral kinase for initial phosphorylation, acyclovir is selectively activated, a the active metabolite accumulates, only in infected cells. Acyclovir triphosphate inhibits viral DNA synthesis by $t$ mechanisms: competition with deoxyGTP for the viral DNA polymerase, resulting in binding to the DNA templatÄ± as an irreversible complex; and chain termination following incorporation into the viral DNA.

> Mechanism of action of antiherpes agents.

> The bioavailability of oral acyclovir is 15-20\% and is unaffected by food. An intravenous formulation is available Topical formulations produce high concentrations in herpetic lesions, but systemic concentrations are undetectable by this route.

> Acyclovir is cleared primarily by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. The half-life is approximately 3 hour in patients with normal renal function and 20 hours in patients with anuria. Acyclovir is readily cleared by hemodialysis but not by peritoneal dialysis. Acyclovir diffuses readily into most tissues and body fluids. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations are $50 \%$ of serum values.

> Oral acyclovir has multiple uses. In first episodes of genital herpes, oral acyclovir shortens the duration of symptoms by approximately 2 days, the time to lesion healing by 4 days, and the duration of viral shedding by days. In recurrent genital herpes, the time course is shortened by 1-2 days. Treatment of first-episode genital herpes does not alter the frequency or severity of recurrent outbreaks. Long-term suppression of genital herpes
with oral acyclovir in patients with frequent recurrences decreases the frequency of symptomatic recurrences a of asymptomatic viral shedding, thus decreasing the rate of sexual transmission. However, outbreaks may resume upon discontinuation of suppressive acyclovir. Oral acyclovir is only modestly beneficial in recurrent herpes labialis. It significantly decreases the total number of lesions, duration of symptoms, and viral shedding patients with varicella (if begun within 24 hours after the onset of rash) or cutaneous zoster (if begun within 72 hours). However, because VZV is less susceptible to acyclovir than HSV, higher doses are required (Table 49-1 When given prophylactically to patients undergoing organ transplantation, oral acyclovir ( 200 mg every 8 hours 800 mg every 12 hours) or intravenous acyclovir ( $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ every 8 hours) prevents reactivation of HSV infectiol

Intravenous acyclovir is the treatment of choice for herpes simplex encephalitis, neonatal HSV infection, and
serious HSV or VZV infections (Table 49-1). In immunocompromised patients with VZV infection, intravenous acyclovir reduces the incidence of cutaneous and visceral dissemination.

Topical acyclovir is substantially less effective than oral therapy for primary HSV infection. It is of no benefit in treating recurrent genital herpes.

Resistance to acyclovir can develop in HSV or VZV through alteration in either the viral thymidine kinase or the DNA polymerase, and clinically resistant infections have been reported in immunocompromised hosts. Most clinical isolates are resistant on the basis of deficient thymidine kinase activity and thus are cross-resistant to valacyclovir, famciclovir, and ganciclovir. Agents such as foscarnet, cidofovir, and trifluridine do not require activation by viral thymidine kinase and thus have preserved activity against the most prevalent acyclovirresistant strains (Figure 49-3).

Acyclovir is generally well tolerated. Nausea, diarrhea, and headache have occasionally been reported. Intravenous infusion may be associated with reversible renal dysfunction (due to crystalline nephropathy) or neurologic toxicity (eg, tremors, delirium, seizures). However, these are uncommon with adequate hydration ar avoidance of rapid infusion rates. High doses of acyclovir cause chromosomal damage and testicular atrophy in rats, but there has been no evidence of teratogenicity, reduction in sperm production, or cytogenetic alteration: in peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients receiving chronic daily suppression of genital herpes for more than : years.

\section*{VALACYCLOVI R}

Valacyclovir is the L -valyl ester of acyclovir (Figure 49-2). It is rapidly converted to acyclovir after oral administration via intestinal and hepatic first-pass metabolism, resulting in serum levels that are three to five times greater than those achieved with oral acyclovir and approximate those achieved with intravenous acyclov administration. Oral bioavailability is $54 \%$, and cerebrospinal fluid levels are $50 \%$ of those in serum. Eliminatior half-life is 2.5-3.3 hours.

Approved uses of valacyclovir include treatment of first or recurrent genital herpes, suppression of frequently recurring genital herpes, and as a 1-day treatment for orolabial herpes (Table 49-1). Once-daily dosing of valacyclovir ( 500 mg ) for chronic suppression in persons with recurrent genital herpes has been shown to markedly decrease the risk of sexual transmission. In comparative trials with acyclovir for the treatment of patients with zoster, rates of cutaneous healing were similar, but valacyclovir was associated with a shorter duration of zoster-associated pain. Valacyclovir has also been shown to be effective in preventing cytomegalovi disease after organ transplantation when compared with placebo.

Valacyclovir is generally well tolerated, although nausea, vomiting, or rash occasionally occur. Agitation, dizzine headache, liver enzyme elevation, anemia, and neutropenia are rare. At high doses, confusion, hallucinations, a seizures have been reported. AIDS patients who received high-dosage valacyclovir chronically (ie, $8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ ) had a increased incidence of gastrointestinal intolerance as well as thrombotic microangiopathies (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic-uremic syndrome).

\section*{FAMCI CLOVI R}

Famciclovir is the diacetyl ester prodrug of 6-deoxypenciclovir, an acyclic guanosine analog (Figure 49-2). After oral administration, famciclovir is rapidly converted by first-pass metabolism to penciclovir. It is active in vitro against HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, EBV, and HBV. As with acyclovir, activation by phosphorylation is catalyzed by the virus-specified thymidine kinase in infected cells, followed by competitive inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase
block DNA synthesis. Unlike acyclovir, however, penciclovir does not cause chain termination. Penciclovir triphosphate has lower affinity for the viral DNA polymerase than acyclovir triphosphate, but it achieves higher intracellular concentrations and has a more prolonged intracellular effect in experimental systems. The most commonly encountered clinical mutants of HSV are thymidine kinase-deficient; these are cross-resistant to acyclovir and famciclovir.

The bioavailability of penciclovir from orally administered famciclovir is $70 \%$. Penciclovir triphosphate has an intracellular half-life of 10 hours in HSV-1-infected cells, 20 hours in HSV-2-infected cells, and 7 hours in VZVinfected cells in vitro. Penciclovir is excreted primarily in the urine.

Oral famciclovir is effective for the treatment of first and recurrent genital herpes, for chronic daily suppression genital herpes, and for the treatment of acute zoster (Table 49-1). One-day usage of famciclovir (1000 mg twic daily) significantly accelerates time to healing of recurrent genital herpes compared with placebo, by approximately 2 days. A single dose of 1500 mg or two 750 mg doses (BID) accelerates herpes labialis healing time. Comparison of famciclovir to valacyclovir for treatment of herpes zoster in immunocompetent patients showed similar rates of cutaneous healing and pain resolution, although both agents were associated with a shortened duration of zoster-associated pain compared with acyclovir.

Oral famciclovir is generally well tolerated, although headache, diarrhea, and nausea may occur. As with acyclovir, testicular toxicity has been demonstrated in animals receiving repeated doses. However, men receivil daily famciclovir ( 250 mg every 12 hours) for 18 weeks had no changes in sperm morphology or motility. The incidence of mammary adenocarcinoma was increased in female rats receiving famciclovir for 2 years.

\section*{PENCI CLOVI R}

The guanosine analog penciclovir, the active metabolite of famciclovir, is also available for topical use. One percent penciclovir cream is effective for the treatment of recurrent herpes labialis in immunocompetent adults (Table 49-1). When therapy was initiated within 1 hour after the onset of signs or symptoms and continued eve 2 hours during waking hours for 4 days, treatment with topical penciclovir resulted in a shortening of the media time until healing by approximately 0.7 days compared with placebo. Side effects are uncommon.

\section*{DOCOSANOL}

Docosanol is a saturated 22-carbon aliphatic alcohol that inhibits fusion between the plasma membrane and the HSV envelope, thereby preventing viral entry into cells and subsequent viral replication. Topical docosanol 10\% cream is available without a prescription. When therapy is initiated within 12 hours of the onset of prodromal symptoms and applied five times daily, the healing time is decreased by approximately 18 hours compared witr placebo in recurrent orolabial herpes.

\section*{TRI FLURI DI NE}

Trifluridine (trifluorothymidine) is a fluorinated pyrimidine nucleoside that inhibits viral DNA synthesis in HSV-1, HSV-2, vaccinia, and some adenoviruses. It is phosphorylated intracellularly to its active form by host cell enzymes, and then competes with thymidine triphosphate for incorporation by the viral DNA polymerase (FigurÄ± 49-3). Incorporation of trifluridine triphosphate into both viral and host DNA prevents its systemic use.
Application of a $1 \%$ solution is effective in treating keratoconjunctivitis and recurrent epithelial keratitis due to HSV-1 and HSV-2. Topical application of trifluridine solution, alone or in combination with interferon alfa, has be used successfully in the treatment of acyclovir-resistant HSV infections.

\section*{AGENTS TO TREAT CYTOMEGALOVI RUS (CMV) INFECTIONS}

CMV infections occur primarily in the setting of advanced immunosuppression and are typically due to reactivati of latent infection. Dissemination of infection results in end-organ disease, including retinitis, colitis, esophagitis central nervous system disease, and pneumonitis. Although the incidence in HI V-infected patients has markedl) decreased with the advent of potent antiretroviral therapy, reactivation of CMV infection after organ transplantation is still clinically prevalent.

The availability of oral valganciclovir and the ganciclovir intraocular implant has decreased the usage of intravenous ganciclovir, intravenous foscarnet, and intravenous cidofovir for the treatment of end-organ CMV disease (Table 49-2). Oral valganciclovir has largely replaced oral ganciclovir because of its lower pill burden. T choice of therapy in patients with CMV retinitis must also take into account the location of the lesion and the extent of immediate visual impairment or threat.

\section*{GANCI CLOVI R}

Ganciclovir is an acyclic guanosine analog (Figure 49-2) that requires activation by triphosphorylation before inhibiting the viral DNA polymerase. Initial phosphorylation is catalyzed by the virus-specified protein kinase phosphotransferase UL97 in CMV- infected cells. The activated compound competitively inhibits viral DNA polymerase and causes termination of viral DNA elongation (Figure 49-3). Ganciclovir has in vitro activity again CMV, HSV, VZV, EBV, HHV-6, and KSHV (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus). Its activity against CMV is to 100 times greater than that of acyclovir.

Ganciclovir may be administered intravenously, orally, or via intraocular implant. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations are approximately $50 \%$ of those in serum. The elimination half-life is 4 hours with normal renal function and the intracellular half-life is 18 hours. Clearance of the drug is linearly related to creatinine clearanc Ganciclovir is readily cleared by hemodialysis. The bioavailability of oral ganciclovir is poor. In patients with an intraocular implant, ganclovir is released into the vitreous cavity at a rate of approximately $1.4 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{h}$.

Intravenous ganciclovir has been shown to delay progression of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS when compared with no treatment. Dual therapy with foscarnet and ganciclovir has been shown to be more effective delaying progression of retinitis than either drug administered alone (see Foscarnet), although side effects are compounded. Intravenous ganciclovir is also used to treat CMV colitis and esophagitis. The risk of Kaposi's sarcoma is reduced in AIDS patients receiving long-term ganciclovir. Intravenous ganciclovir, followed by either oral ganciclovir or high-dose oral acyclovir, reduces the risk of CMV infection in transplant recipients. Intravenoi ganciclovir for CMV pneumonitis in immunocompromised patients may be beneficial, particularly in combination with intravenous cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin. Oral ganciclovir is indicated for prevention of end-organ CM disease in AIDS patients and as maintenance therapy of CMV retinitis after induction. Although less effective thi
intravenous ganciclovir, the risk of myelosuppression and of catheter-related complications is diminished.
Ganciclovir may also be administered intraocularly to treat CMV retinitis, either by direct intravitreal administration or via an intraocular implant. The implant, which achieves high and prolonged intraocular levels , ganciclovir, has been shown to delay progression of retinitis to a greater degree than systemic therapy with ganciclovir. Surgical replacement is required at intervals of 5-8 months. Concurrent therapy with a systemic an CMV agent is recommended.

Resistance to ganciclovir increases with duration of usage. The more common mutation is in UL97, resulting in decreased levels of the triphosphorylated (ie, active) form of ganciclovir. The less common UL54 mutation in DN polymerase results in higher levels of resistance and potential cross-resistance with cidofovir and foscarnet. Antiviral susceptibility testing is recommended in patients in whom resistance is suspected clinically, as is the substitution of alternative therapies and concomitant reduction in immunosuppressive therapies, if possible. Thi addition of CMV hyperimmune globulin may also be considered.

The most common adverse effect of systemic ganciclovir treatment, particularly after intravenous administratio is myelosuppression. Myelosuppression may be additive in patients receiving concurrent zidovudine, azathioprir or mycophenolate mofetil. Other potential adverse effects are nausea, diarrhea, fever, rash, headache, insomn and peripheral neuropathy, as well as retinal detachment in patients with CMV retinitis. Central nervous system toxicity (confusion, seizures, psychiatric disturbance) and hepatotoxicity have been rarely reported. Ganciclovir mitogenic in mammalian cells and carcinogenic and embryotoxic at high doses in animals and causes aspermatogenesis; the clinical significance of these preclinical data is unclear.

Levels of ganciclovir may rise in patients concurrently taking probenecid or trimethoprim. Concurrent use of ganciclovir with didanosine may result in increased levels of didanosine.

\section*{VALGANCI CLOVI R}

Valganciclovir is an L-valyl ester prodrug of ganciclovir that exists as a mixture of two diastereomers (Figure 49-2). After oral administration, both diastereomers are rapidly hydrolyzed to ganciclovir by intestinal and hepi esterases.

Valganciclovir is well absorbed and rapidly metabolized in the intestinal wall and liver to ganciclovir; no other metabolites have been detected. The absolute bioavailability of oral valganciclovir is $60 \%$; it is recommended th the drug be taken with food. The $A_{U C_{0-24 h}}$ resulting from valganciclovir ( 900 mg once daily) is similar to that af $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ once daily of intravenous ganciclovir, and approximately 1.65 times that of oral ganciclovir. Plasma protein binding is less than $2 \%$. The major route of elimination is renal-through glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Plasma concentrations of valganciclovir are reduced approximately $50 \%$ by hemodialysis.

Valganciclovir is indicated for the treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS and for the prevention of CMV disease in high-risk kidney, heart, and kidney-pancreas transplant patients. Adverse effects, drug interactions, and resistance patterns are the same as those associated with ganciclovir.

\section*{FOSCARNET}

Foscarnet (phosphonoformic acid) is an inorganic pyrophosphate compound (Figure 49-2) that inhibits viral DN polymerase, RNA polymerase, and HIV reverse transcriptase directly without requiring activation by phosphorylation. It has in vitro activity against HSV, VZV, CMV, EBV, HHV-6, KSHV, and HIV-1.

Foscarnet is available in an intravenous formulation only; poor oral bioavailability and gastrointestinal intoleranc
preclude oral use. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations are $43-67 \%$ of steady-state serum concentrations. Althou the mean plasma half-life is $3-6.8$ hours, up to $30 \%$ of foscarnet may be deposited in bone, with a half-life of several months. The clinical repercussions of this are unknown. Clearance of foscarnet is primarily by the kidne! and is directly proportional to creatinine clearance. Serum drug concentrations are reduced approximately 50\% by hemodialysis.

An effective treatment for CMV retinitis, foscarnet has an efficacy approximately equal to that of ganciclovir. Foscarnet is also used for treatment of CMV colitis, CMV esophagitis, acyclovir-resistant HSV infection, and acyclovir-resistant VZV infection. The dosage of foscarnet must be titrated according to the patient's calculated creatinine clearance before each infusion. Use of an infusion pump to control the rate of infusion is important to avoid toxicity, and relatively large volumes of fluid are required because of the drug's poor solubility. The combination of ganciclovir and foscarnet is synergistic in vitro against CMV and has been shown to be superior t either agent alone in delaying progression of retinitis; however, toxicity is also increased when both agents are administered concurrently. As with ganciclovir, a decrease in the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma has been observed in patients who have received long-term foscarnet.

Foscarnet has been administered intravitreally for the treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS, but data regarding efficacy and safety are lacking.

Resistance to foscarnet in HSV and CMV isolates is due to point mutations in the DNA polymerase gene and is typically associated with prolonged or repeated exposure to the drug. Mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase gene have also been described. Although foscarnet-resistant CMV isolates are typically crossresistant to ganciclovir, foscarnet activity is usually maintained against ganciclovir- and cidofovir-resistant isola of CMV.

Potential adverse effects of foscarnet include renal impairment, hypo- or hypercalcemia, hypo- or hyperphosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. Saline preloading helps to prevent nephrotoxicity, as does avoidance of concomitant administration of drugs with nephrotoxic potential (eg, amphotericin B, pentamidine, aminoglycosides). The risk of severe hypocalcemia is increased with concomitant use of pentamidine. Penile ulcerations associated with foscarnet therapy may be due to high levels of ionized drug in t urine. Nausea, vomiting, anemia, elevation of liver enzymes, and fatigue have been reported; the risk of anemi may be additive in patients receiving concurrent zidovudine. Central nervous system toxicities include headach hallucinations, and seizures; seizures may be increased with concurrent use of imipenem. Foscarnet caused chromosomal damage in preclinical studies.

\section*{CI DOFOVI R}

Cidofovir (Figure 49-2) is a cytosine nucleotide analog with in vitro activity against CMV, HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, EBV, HHV-6, KSHV, adenovirus, poxviruses, polyomaviruses, and human papillomavirus. In contrast to ganciclovir, phosphorylation of cidofovir to the active diphosphate is independent of viral enzymes (Figure 49-3 After phosphorylation, cidofovir acts both as a potent inhibitor of and as an alternative substrate for viral DNA polymerase, competitively inhibiting DNA synthesis and becoming incorporated into the viral DNA chain. Isolate with resistance to cidofovir have been selected in vitro; these isolates tend to be cross-resistant with ganciclovi but retain susceptibility to foscarnet. Clinical resistance to cidofovir has not been reported to date in patients.

Although the terminal half-life of cidofovir is about 2.6 hours, the active metabolite, cidofovir diphosphate, has i prolonged intracellular half-life of 17-65 hours, thus allowing widely spaced administration. A separate metabolite, cidofovir phosphocholine, has a half-life of at least 87 hours and may serve as an intracellular
reservoir of active drug. Cerebrospinal fluid penetration is poor. Elimination involves active renal tubular secretion. High-flux hemodialysis has been shown to reduce the serum levels of cidofovir by approximately 75\%

Intravenous cidofovir is effective for the treatment of CMV retinitis and is used experimentally to treat adenovirà¥¤ infections. Intravenous cidofovir must be administered with probenecid ( 2 g at 3 hours before the infusion and at 2 and 8 hours after), which blocks active tubular secretion and decreases nephrotoxicity. Cidofovir dosage must be adjusted for alterations in the calculated creatinine clearance or the presence of urine protein before each infusion, and aggressive adjunctive hydration is required. Initiation of cidofovir therapy is contraindicated patients with existing renal insufficiency. Direct intravitreal administration of cidofovir is not recommended because of ocular toxicity.

The primary adverse effect of intravenous cidofovir is a dose-dependent nephrotoxicity, which may be reduced with prehydration using normal saline. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic agents (eg, amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pentamidine, foscarnet) should be avoided. Prior administration of foscarnet may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Other potential side effects include uveitis, ocular hypotony, neutropenia (15\%), and metabolic acidosis. Gastrointestinal intolerance, fever and rash due to probenecid may occur. The drug caused mammary adenocarcinomas in rats and is embryotoxic

\section*{ANTI RETROVI RAL AGENTS}

Substantial advances have been made in antiretroviral therapy since the introduction of the first agent, zidovudine, in 1987, and many antiretroviral agents are now available (Table 49-3). In addition, greater knowledge of viral dynamics through the use of viral load and resistance testing has made clear that combinatic therapy with maximally efficacious and potent agents will reduce viral replication to the lowest possible level an decrease the likelihood of emergence of resistance. Thus, administration of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), typically comprising a combination of 3-4 antiretroviral agents, has become the standard of care. Suc regimens may be composed of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, and a fusion inhibitor (see below). Viral susceptibility to specific agents varies among patients and may change with time, owing to development of resistance. Therefore, such combinations must be chosen with care and tailored to the individual, as must changes to a given regimen. In addition to potency and susceptibility, important factors in the selection of agents for any given patient are tolerability, convenience, and optimization of adherence (see Treatment of HIV-Infected Individuals: Importance of Pharmacokinetic Knowledge).

As new agents have become available, several older ones have had diminished usage, because of either suboptimal safety profile or inferior antiviral potency.

\section*{Treatment of HI V-I nfected I ndividuals: I mportance of Pharmacokinetic Knowledge}

Concurrent use of many medications is necessary in most HIV-infected patients. These medications include combinations of antiretroviral agents, prophylaxis or treatment for opportunistic infections, antiemetics, neuropsychiatric drugs, and opioid pain medications. Such extreme polypharmacy necessitates awareness of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions.

Perhaps the most important of the pharmacokinetic complications results from the metabolism of the NNRTI an Pl agents by the CYP450 enzyme system, primarily the 3A4 isoform. Because many are inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 as well as substrates, drug-drug interactions may have marked clinical ramifications. However, variable effects on different CYP450 isoforms may make interactions somewhat unpredictable. For example, in the treatment of tuberculosis, the use of rifampin, a standard antimycobacterial agent but also one of the most pot 3A4 inducers, may either decrease efficacy (eg, atazanavir, lopinavir) or increase toxicity (eg, saquinavir) of concurrent antiretroviral agents, owing to alteration of serum levels. Increased levels of rifabutin (associated wi uveitis) or trazodone (causing hypotension, syncope), when co-administered with ritonavir, may markedly increase toxicity. Increased levels of clarithromycin used for treatment or prophylaxis of Mycobacterium avium infection or as an antibacterial agent, when co-administered with indinavir, ritonavir, and atazanavir, may increase the potential for QT interval prolongation. Conversely, decreased levels of clarithromycin with efaviren: may reduce antibacterial efficacy. Most recently, these types of interactions have been used to advantage in thi form of dual protease inhibitor regimens (boosted regimens), based on resultant increased plasma concentratic of the substrate (eg, lopinavir, saquinavir) when co-administered with an inducer (most often ritonavir). Improà¥¤ drug exposure, increased antiviral potency, more convenient dosing, and improved tolerability result, thus improving patient adherence.

\section*{Nucleoside \& Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors}

The NRTIs act by competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and can also be incorporated into the growing viral DNA chain to cause termination (Figure 49-4). Each requires intracytoplasmic activation via phosphorylation by cellular enzymes to the triphosphate form. Most have activity against HIV-2 as well as HIV-:

Life cycle of HIV. Binding of viral glycoproteins to host cell CD4 and chemokine receptors precedes fusion and entry into the cell. After uncoating, reverse transcription copies the single-stranded HIV RNA genome into double-stranded DNA, which is integrated into the host cell genome. Gene transcription by host cell enzymes produces messenger RNA, which is translated into proteins that assemble into immature noninfectious virions that bud from the host cell membrane. Maturation into fully
infectious virions is through proteolytic cleavage.

Nucleoside analogs may be associated with mitochondrial toxicity, probably owing to inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, and they can increase the risk of lactic acidosis with hepatic steatosis, which may be fatal, as well as disorders of lipid metabolism. NRTI treatment should be suspended in the setting of rapidly risil aminotransferase levels, progressive hepatomegaly, or metabolic acidosis of unknown cause.

\section*{ABACAVI R}

Abacavir is a guanosine analog (Figure 49-2) that is well absorbed following oral administration (83\%) and unaffected by food. The elimination half-life is 1.5 hours, and the intracellular half-life ranges from 12 to 26 hou Cerebrospinal fluid levels are approximately one third those of plasma.

High-level resistance to abacavir appears to require at least two or three concomitant mutations (eg, M184V, L74V, D67N) and thus tends to develop slowly. The K65R mutation is associated with reduced susceptibility to lamivudine, abacavir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine.

Hypersensitivity reactions, occasionally fatal, have been reported in approximately $5 \%$ of patients receiving abacavir. Symptoms, which generally occur within the first 6 weeks of therapy, include fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia. Respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, pharyngitis, and cough may also be present, and skin rash occurs in about $50 \%$ of patients. Laboratory abnormalities such as mildly elevated serun aminotransferase or creatine kinase levels may be present but are not specific for the hypersensitivity reaction. Although the syndrome tends to resolve quickly with discontinuation of medication, rechallenge with abacavir results in return of symptoms within hours and may be fatal. Other potential adverse events are rash, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dyspnea, fatigue, and pancreatitis (rare).

\section*{DIDANOSINE}

Didanosine (ddl) is a synthetic analog of deoxyadenosine (Figure 49-2). Oral bioavailability is 30-40\%; dosing an empty stomach is required. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of the drug are approximately $20 \%$ of serum concentrations. The elimination half-life is 1.5 hours, but the intracellular half-life of the activated compound is long as 20-24 hours. The drug is eliminated by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Dosage reduction is therefore required for low creatinine clearance and for low body weight (Table 49-3).

Buffered powder for oral solution and chewable tablets are taken twice daily; enteric-coated capsules can be taken once daily because of greater bioavailability. The buffer in the tablets and powder interferes with absorpt of indinavir, delavirdine, dapsone, and itraconazole; therefore, concurrent administration is to be avoided. Because the tablets contain both phenylalanine ( 36.5 mg ) and sodium ( 1380 mg ), caution should be exercised patients with phenylketonuria and those on sodium-restricted diets.

Resistance to didanosine is typically associated with the L74V mutation, although decreased susceptibility may also occur in the presence of K65R and multiple thymidine analog mutations (TAMs). These may partially restor susceptibility to zidovudine but may confer cross-resistance to abacavir, zalcitabine, and lamivudine. The M184' mutation is found in a significant proportion of isolates selected by didanosine and may confer resistance to lamivudine.

The major clinical toxicity associated with didanosine therapy is dose-dependent pancreatitis. Other risk factors for pancreatitis (eg, alcoholism, hypertriglyceridemia) are relative contraindications to administration of didanosine, and other drugs with the potential to cause pancreatitis, including zalcitabine and stavudine, shoulc
be avoided (Table 49-3). Other reported adverse effects include painful peripheral distal neuropathy, diarrhea (particularly with tablets and powder), hepatitis, esophageal ulceration, cardiomyopathy, and central nervous system toxicity (headache, irritability, insomnia). Asymptomatic hyperuricemia may precipitate attacks of gout susceptible individuals. Reports of retinal changes and optic neuritis in patients receiving didanosine, particularl in adults receiving high doses and in children, mandate periodic retinal examinations.

Fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines should be administered at least 2 hours before or after didanosine to avoid decreased antibiotic plasma concentrations due to chelation. Serum levels of didanosine are increased when co administered with tenofovir and ganciclovir, thus increasing the risk of toxicity; they are decreased by atazanav delavirdine, ritonavir, tipranavir, and methadone (Table 49-4).

\section*{EMTRI CI TABI NE}

Emtricitabine (formerly called FTC) is a fluorinated analog of lamivudine with a long intracellular half-life (> 39 hours), allowing for once-daily dosing (Figure 49-2). Oral bioavailability of the capsules is $93 \%$ and is unaffecte by food, but penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid is low. Elimination is by both glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. The mean plasma elimination half-life is 8-9 hours.

The oral solution, which contains propylene glycol, is contraindicated in young children, pregnant women, patie with renal or hepatic failure, and those using metronidazole or disulfiram. Also, because of its in vitro activity against HBV, patients co-infected with HIV and HBV should be closely monitored if treatment with emtricitabine interrupted or discontinued, owing to the likelihood of hepatitis flares.

Like lamivudine, the M184V/I mutation is most frequently associated with emtricitabine use and may emerge rapidly in patients receiving HAART regimens that are not fully suppressive. There is cross-resistance to lamivudine but not to other NRTI agents. Isolates with the K65R mutation may have decreased susceptibility to emtricitabine. Because of their similar mechanisms of action and resistance profiles, the combination of lamivudine and emtricitabine is not recommended.

The most common adverse effects observed in patients receiving emtricitabine are headache, diarrhea, nausea and asthenia. In addition, hyperpigmentation of the palms and/or soles may be observed ( $\sim 3 \%$ ), particularly il blacks (up to 13\%). No drug-drug interactions of note have been reported to date.

\section*{LAMI VUDI NE}

Lamivudine (3TC) is a cytosine analog (Figure 49-2) with in vitro activity against HIV-1 that is synergistic with : variety of antiretroviral nucleoside analogsâincluding zidovudine and stavudineâagainst both zidovudinesensitive and zidovudine-resistant HIV-1 strains. Activity against HBV is described below.

Oral bioavailability exceeds $80 \%$ and is not food-dependent. In children, the mean cerebrospinal fluid: plasma ratio of lamivudine was 0.2 . Mean elimination half-life is 2.5 hours, whereas the intracellular half-life of the acti 5'-triphosphate metabolite in HIV-1-infected cell lines is 10.5-15.5 hours. The majority of lamivudine is elimina unchanged in the urine, and the dose should be reduced in patients with renal insufficiency or low body weight (Table 49-3).

Lamivudine therapy rapidly selects for the M184V mutation in regimens that are not fully suppressive; this mutation confers high-level resistance as well as a reduction in susceptibility to abacavir, didanosine, and zalcitabine. Conversely, the M184V mutation may restore phenotypic susceptibility to zidovudine, indicating tha this two-drug combination regimen may be particularly beneficial. However, HIV-1 strains resistant to both lamivudine and zidovudine have been isolated. The K65R mutation is associated with reduced susceptibility to lamivudine, abacavir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine.

Potential adverse effects are headache, insomnia, fatigue, and gastrointestinal discomfort, although these are typically mild. Lamivudine's bioavailability increases when it is co-administered with trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another in vit thus decreasing potency; therefore, their concurrent use should be avoided if possible.

\section*{STAVUDI NE}

The thymidine analog stavudine (d4T) (Figure 49-2) has high oral bioavailability (86\%) that is not fooddependent. The plasma half-life is 1.2 hours, the intracellular half-life is approximately 3.5 hours, and mean cerebrospinal fluid concentrations are $55 \%$ of those of plasma. Excretion is by active tubular secretion and glomerular filtration. The dosage of stavudine should be reduced in patients with renal insufficiency and low boc weight (Table 49-3).

A number of mutations are associated with reduced susceptibility to stavudine; the predominant mutations are M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, and K219O.

The major dose-limiting toxicity is a dose-related peripheral sensory neuropathy. The incidence of neuropathy may be increased when stavudine is administered with other neuropathy-inducing drugs such as didanosine an zalcitabine. Symptoms typically resolve completely upon discontinuation of stavudine; in such cases, a reduced dosage may be cautiously restarted. Other potential adverse effects include pancreatitis, arthralgias, and elevation in serum aminotransferases. Lactic acidosis with hepatic steatosis, as well as fat atrophy, appears to occur more frequently in patients receiving stavudine than in those receiving other NRTI agents. Moreover, because the co-administration of stavudine and didanosine may increase the incidence of lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, concurrent use should be avoided, if possible. This combination has been implicated in several deaths in HIV-infected pregnant women. A rare side effect is a rapidly progressive ascending neuromuscular weakness. Since zidovudine may reduce the phosphorylation of stavudine, these two drugs should generally no be used together.

\section*{TENOFOVI R}

Tenofovir is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate (ie, nucleotide) analog of adenosine (Figure 49-2). Like the nucleoside analogs, tenofovir competitively inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase and causes chain termination afte incorporation into DNA.

Tenofovir disopoxilfumarate is a water-soluble prodrug of active tenofovir. The oral bioavailability in fasted patients is approximately $25 \%$ and increases to $39 \%$ after a high-fat meal. Serum half-life is 17 hours and intracellular half-life is prolonged at more than 60 hours. Elimination occurs by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, and the dosage must be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency.

The primary mutation associated with resistance to tenofovir is K65R, although varying degrees of decreased susceptibility to tenofovir may be conferred by zidovudine-associated mutations (eg, M41L, L210W), according the number of specific mutations present.

Gastrointestinal complaints (eg, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, flatulence) are the most common side effects but rarely require discontinuation of therapy. Other potential adverse effects include headache and asthenia. Preclinical studies in several animal species have demonstrated bone toxicity (eg, osteomalacia); however, to date there has been no evidence of bone toxicity in humans. Cases of renal impairment, including acute renal failure and Fanconi's syndrome, have been reported in patients receiving tenofovir. Tenofovir may compete witl other drugs that are actively secreted by the kidneys, such as cidofovir, acyclovir, and ganciclovir. The
combination of tenofovir with didanosine is associated with both decreased virologic efficacy and increased toxic (due to increased didanosine levels) and therefore should be avoided.

\section*{ZALCI TABI NE}

Zalcitabine (ddC) is a cytosine analog with high oral bioavailability (> 80\%) and a relatively long intracellular hÄ life ( 10 hours) despite its elimination half-life of 1-2 hours (Figure 49-2). However, plasma levels decrease by $25-39 \%$ when the drug is administered with food or antacids. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations are approximately $20 \%$ of those in the plasma.

Although a variety of mutations associated with in vitro resistance to zalcitabine have been described (eg, T69[ K65R, M184V, L74V), phenotypic resistance appears to be rare, particularly in combination regimens.

Zalcitabine therapy is associated with a dose-dependent peripheral neuropathy that can be treatment-limiting i 10-20\% of patients but appears to be slowly reversible if treatment is stopped promptly. The potential for caus peripheral neuropathy constitutes a relative contraindication to use with other drugs that may cause this toxicit including stavudine, didanosine, and isoniazid. Decreased renal clearance caused by amphotericin B, foscarnet, and aminoglycosides may increase the risk of zalcitabine neuropathy. The other major reported toxicity is oral a esophageal ulcerations. Pancreatitis occurs less frequently than with didanosine administration, but coadministration of other drugs that cause pancreatitis may increase the frequency of this adverse effect. Headache, nausea, rash, and arthralgias may occur but tend to be mild or resolve during therapy.
Cardiomyopathy has rarely been reported. Zalcitabine causes thymic lymphomas in rodents, but no clinical correlates have been observed in humans.

The AUC of zalcitabine increases when co-administered with probenecid or cimetidine, and bioavailability decreases with concurrent antacids or metoclopramide. Lamivudine inhibits the phosphorylation of zalcitabine ir vitro, potentially interfering with its efficacy.

\section*{ZI DOVUDI NE}

Zidovudine (azidothymidine; AZT) is a deoxythymidine analog (Figure 49-2) that is well absorbed from the gut and distributed to most body tissues and fluids, including the cerebrospinal fluid, where drug levels are 60-65\% of those in serum. The serum half-life averages 1 hour, and the intracellular half-life of the phosphorylated compound is 3-7 hours. Zidovudine is eliminated primarily by renal excretion following glucuronidation in the liver. Clearance of zidovudine is reduced by approximately $50 \%$ in uremic patients, and toxicity may increase in patients with advanced hepatic insufficiency.

Zidovudine was the first antiretroviral agent to be approved and has been well studied. The drug has been shov to decrease the rate of clinical disease progression and prolong survival in HIV-infected individuals. Efficacy has also been demonstrated in the treatment of HIV-associated dementia and thrombocytopenia. In pregnancy (Ta 49-5), a regimen of oral zidovudine beginning between 14 and 34 weeks of gestation ( 100 mg five times a day intravenous zidovudine during labor ( $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ over 1 hour, then $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h}$ by continuous infusion), and zidovudine syrup to the neonate from birth through 6 weeks of age ( $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ every 6 hours) has been shown tc reduce the rate of vertical (mother-to-newborn) transmission of HIV by up to $23 \%$.

As with other NRTI agents, resistance may limit clinical efficacy. High-level zidovudine resistance is generally $\mathrm{s} \in$ in strains with three or more of the five most common mutations: M41L, D67N, K70R, T215F, and K219Q. However, the emergence of certain mutations that confer decreased susceptibility to one drug (eg, L74V for didanosine and M184V for lamivudine) seems to enhance zidovudine susceptibility in previously zidovudineresistant strains. Withdrawal of zidovudine exposure may permit the reversion of zidovudine-resistant HIV-1 isolates to the susceptible wild-type phenotype.

The most common adverse effect of zidovudine is myelosuppression, resulting in macrocytic anemia (1-4\%) or neutropenia ( $2-8 \%$ ). Gastrointestinal intolerance, headaches, and insomnia may occur but tend to resolve duri therapy. Less frequent toxicities include thrombocytopenia, hyperpigmentation of the nails, and myopathy. Ver! high doses can cause anxiety, confusion, and tremulousness. Zidovudine causes vaginal neoplasms in mice; however, no human cases of genital neoplasms have been reported to date.

Increased serum levels of zidovudine may occur with concomitant administration of probenecid, phenytoin, methadone, fluconazole, atovaquone, valproic acid, and lamivudine, either through inhibition of first-pass metabolism or through decreased clearance. Zidovudine may decrease phenytoin levels, and this warrants monitoring of serum phenytoin levels in epileptic patients taking both agents. Hematologic toxicity may be increased during co-administration of other myelosuppressive drugs such as ganciclovir, ribavirin, and cytotoxic agents. Combination regimens containing zidovudine and stavudine should be avoided; antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro.

\section*{Nonnucleoside Reverse Transcriptase I nhibitors}

The NNRTIs bind directly to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (Figure 49-4), resulting in blockade of RNA- and DNAdependent DNA polymerase. The binding site of NNRTIs is near to but distinct from that of NRTIs. Unlike the NF agents, NNRTIs neither compete with nucleoside triphosphates nor require phosphorylation to be active. NNRTI resistance occurs rapidly with monotherapy and can be due to a single mutation (eg, K103N). The K103N and Y181C mutations confer resistance across the entire class of NNRTIs, whereas L100I, Y188C, and G190A confer resistance to both nevirapine and efavirenz.

As a class, NNRTI agents tend to be associated with varying levels of gastrointestinal intolerance and skin rash, the latter of which may infrequently be serious (eg, Stevens-J ohnson syndrome). A further limitation to use of NNRTI agents as a component of HAART is their metabolism by the CYP450 system, leading to innumerable
potential drug-drug interactions (Tables 49-3 and 49-4). NNRTI agents are all substrates for CYP3A4 and can c as inducers (nevirapine), inhibitors (delavirdine), or mixed inducers and inhibitors (efavirenz). Given the large number of non-HIV medications that are also metabolized by this pathway (see Chapter 4); drug-drug interactions must be expected and looked for.

\section*{DELAVI RDI NE}

Delavirdine has an oral bioavailability of about $85 \%$, but this is reduced by antacids or $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-blockers. It is extensively bound ( $\sim 98 \%$ ) to plasma proteins and has correspondingly low cerebrospinal fluid levels.

Skin rash occurs in approximately 18\% of patients receiving delavirdine; it typically occurs during the first 1-3 weeks of therapy and does not preclude rechallenge. However, severe rash such as erythema multiforme and Stevens-J ohnson syndrome have rarely been reported. Other possible adverse effects are headache, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and increased serum aminotransferase levels. Delavirdine has been shown to be teratogenic rats, causing ventricular septal defects and other malformations at dosages not unlike those achieved in humar Thus, pregnancy should be avoided when taking delavirdine.

Delavirdine is extensively metabolized to inactive metabolites by the CYP3A and CYP2D6 enzymes and also inhibits CYP3A4 and 2C9. Therefore, there are numerous potential drug-drug interactions to consider (Tables 49-3 and 49-4). Because of this effect, however, co-administration with delavirdine may allow indinavir or saquinavir to be dosed twice daily rather than the usual three times a day. The concurrent use of delavirdine wi amprenavir/fosamprenavir and rifabutin is not recommended because of decreased delavirdine levels.

\section*{EFAVI RENZ}

Efavirenz can be given once daily because of its long half-life ( $40-55$ hours). It is moderately well absorbed following oral administration ( $45 \%$ ). Since toxicity may increase owing to increased bioavailability after a high-f meal, efavirenz should be taken on an empty stomach. Peak plasma concentrations occur 3-5 hours after administration of daily doses; steady-state plasma concentrations are reached in 6-10 days. Efavirenz is principally metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 to inactive hydroxylated metabolites; the remainder is eliminate in the feces as unchanged drug. It is highly bound to albumin ( $\sim 99 \%$ ), and cerebrospinal fluid levels range fror $0.3 \%$ to $1.2 \%$ of plasma levels.

The principal adverse effects of efavirenz involve the central nervous system (dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia, headache, confusion, amnesia, agitation, delusions, depression, nightmares, euphoria); these may occur in up $50 \%$ of patients and may be severe. However, they tend to resolve after the first month of treatment. Skin rasl has also been reported early in therapy in up to $28 \%$ of patients, is usually mild to moderate in severity, and typically resolves despite continuation. Other potential adverse reactions are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, crystalluria, elevated liver enzymes, and an increase in total serum cholesterol by 10-20\%. High rates of fetal abnormalities occurred in pregnant monkeys exposed to efavirenz in doses roughly equivalent to the human dosage; several cases of congenital anomalies have been reported in humans. Therefore, efanirenz should be avoided in pregnant women, particularly in the first trimester.

Efavirenz is both an inducer and an inhibitor of CYP3A4, thus inducing its own metabolism and interacting with 1 metabolism of many other drugs (Tables 49-3 and 49-4).

\section*{NEVI RAPI NE}

The oral bioavailability of nevirapine is excellent ( $\sim 90 \%$ ) and is not food-dependent. The drug is highly lipophili and achieves cerebrospinal fluid levels that are $45 \%$ of those in plasma. Serum half-life is $25-30$ hours. It is
extensively metabolized by the CYP3A isoform to hydroxylated metabolites and then excreted, primarily in the urine.

In addition to its use as a component of a combination antiretroviral regimen, a single dose of nevirapine (200 mg ) has been shown to be effective in the prevention of transmission of HIV from mother to newborn when administered to women at the onset of labor and followed by a $2-\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ oral dose to the neonate within 3 days after delivery. However, resistance has been documented after this single dose.

Rash occurs in approximately 17\% of patients, most typically in the first 4-6 weeks of therapy, and is doselimiting in about 7\% of patients. When initiating therapy, gradual dose escalation over 14 days is recommendec to decrease the incidence of rash. Women may have a greater propensity for rash. Severe and life-threatening skin rashes have been rarely reported, including Stevens-J ohnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Nevirapine therapy should be immediately discontinued in patients with severe rash and in those with accompanying constitutional symptoms. Hepatotoxicity occurs in about $4 \%$ of patients and appears to occur mc frequently in those with higher pre-therapy CD4 cell counts (ie, > 250 cells $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ in women and $>400$ cells $/ \mathrm{mm}$ in men), in women, and in those with hepatitis B or C co-infection. Fulminant hepatitis may rarely occur, typical within the first 18 weeks of therapy and can be fatal. Other adverse effects associated with nevirapine therapy fever, nausea, headache, and somnolence.

Nevirapine is a moderate inducer of CYP3A metabolism, resulting in decreased levels of amprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, efavirenz, and methadone if administered concurrently (Table 49-4). Drugs that induce tr CYP3A system, such as tipranavir, rifampin, rifabutin, and St. John's wort, can decrease levels of nevirapine, whereas those that inhibit CYP3A activity, such as fluconazole, ketoconazole, and clarithromycin, can increase nevirapine levels.

\section*{Protease I nhibitors}

During the later stages of the HIV growth cycle, the Gag and Gag-Pol gene products are translated into polyproteins, and these become immature budding particles. Protease is responsible for cleaving these precursÄ± molecules to produce the final structural proteins of the mature virion core. By preventing cleavage of the Gagpolyprotein, protease inhibitors (PIs) result in the production of immature, noninfectious viral particles (Figure 49-4). Unfortunately, specific genotypic alterations that confer phenotypic resistance are fairly common with these agents, thus contraindicating monotherapy. Some of the most common mutations conferring resistance $t$ most if not all of the PI agents are L10I/R/V, M46I/L, I54V/M/L, V82A/F/T/S, and I84V.

A syndrome of redistribution and accumulation of body fat that results in central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral and facial wasting, breast enlargement, and a cushingoid appearance 1 been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. These abnormalities may be particularly associated with the use of PIs, although the recently licensed atazanavir appears to be an exception (see below). Concurre increases in triglyceride and LDL levels, along with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, have also been noted. The cause is not yet known.

Protease inhibitors have been associated with increased spontaneous bleeding in patients with hemophilia A or All of the antiretroviral Pls are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A4, with ritonavir having the most pronounced inhibitory effect and saquinavir the least. Some Pl agents such as amprenavir and ritonavir are also inducers of specific CYP isoforms. As a result, there is enormous potential for drug-drug interactions with other antiretroviri agents and other commonly used medications (Tables 49-3 and 49-4). It is noteworthy that the potent CYP3A/
inhibitory properties of ritonavir have been utilized to clinical advantage by having it "boost" the levels of other agents when given in combination.

\section*{AMPRENAVIR}

Amprenavir is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and can be taken with or without food. However, high-fat meals decrease absorption and thus should be avoided. The plasma half-life is relatively long (7-10.6 hours). Amprenavir is metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 and should be used with caution in the setting of hepatic insufficiency.

The key mutation conferring resistance to amprenavir appears to be 150 V . Evidence to date suggests that cross resistance to other members of the PI class of drugs may be less prevalent with amprenavir than with previous available compounds.

The most common adverse effects of amprenavir are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, perioral paresthesias, depression, and rash. Up to $3 \%$ of patients in clinical trials to date have had rashes (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome) severe enough to warrant drug discontinuation.

Amprenavir is both an inducer and an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and is contraindicated with numerous other drugs (Tables 49-3 and 49-4). The oral solution, which contains propylene glycol, is contraindicated in young childrer pregnant women, patients with renal or hepatic failure, and those using metronidazole or disulfiram. Also, the c solutions of amprenavir and ritonavir should not be co-administered because the propylene glycol in one and th ethanol in the other may compete for the same metabolic pathway, leading to accumulation of either. Because the oral solution also contains vitamin E at several times the recommended daily dosage, supplemental vitamin should be avoided. Amprenavir is contraindicated in patients with a history of sulfa allergy because it is itself a sulfonamide. Lopinavir/ritonavir should not be co-administered with amprenavir owing to decreased amprenavii and increased lopinavir exposures. An increased dosage of amprenavir is recommended when co-administered with efavirenz (with or without the addition of ritonavir to boost levels).

\section*{ATAZANAVI R}

Atazanavir is a newer azapeptide PI with a pharmacokinetic profile that allows once-daily dosing. Its oral bioavailability is approximately $60-68 \%$; the drug should be taken with food. Atazanavir requires an acidic medium for absorption and exhibits pH-dependent aqueous solubility; therefore, separation of ingestion from acid-reducing agents by at least 12 hours is recommended. Atazanavir is able to penetrate both the cerebrospià¥¤ and seminal fluids. The plasma half-life is $6-7$ hours, which increases to approximately 11 hours when coadministered with ritonavir. The primary route of elimination is biliary; atazanavir should not be given to patient with severe hepatic insufficiency.

Resistance to atazanavir has been associated with various known PI mutations including the novel I50L substitution, which has been associated with increased susceptibility to other PIs.

The most common adverse effects in patients receiving atazanavir in clinical trials were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, peripheral neuropathy, and skin rash. As with indinavir, indirect hyperbilirubinemia with overt jaundice may occur, in all likelihood owing to inhibition of the UGT1A1 enzyme. Although bilirubinemia is not regularly associated with hepatic injury, elevation of hepatic enzymes has also be observed, usually in patients with underlying hepatitis B or C infection. In contrast to the other Pls, atazanavir does not appear to be associated with dyslipidemias, fat redistribution, or the metabolic syndrome. Atazanavir may be associated with electrocardiographic PR interval prolongation, which is usually inconsequential but may
exacerbated by other causative agents such as calcium channel blockers. Also, a possible concentrationdependent increase in the $\mathrm{QT}_{\mathrm{c}}$ interval may occur in patients receiving atazanavir in dosages greater than 400 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ or in conjunction with the CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin.

As an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, the potential for drug-drug interactions with atazanavir is great (see Tables 49-3 and 49-4). Atazanavir AUC is reduced by 76\% on average when combined with omeprazole; thus, the combination is to be avoided. In addition, co-administration of atazanavir with other drugs that inhibit the glucuronidation enzyme UGT1A1, such as indinavir and irinotecan, is contraindicated because of enhanced toxicity. Tenofovir and efavirenz should not be co-administered with atazanavir unless ritonavir is added to boo: levels.

\section*{FOSAMPRENAVI R}

Fosamprenavir is a prodrug of amprenavir that is rapidly hydrolyzed by enzymes in the intestinal epithelium. Tablets may be taken with or without food. Because of its significantly lower daily pill burden, fosamprenavir tablets have replaced amprenavir capsules for adults. All pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic attributes are those of amprenavir (see above).

\section*{I NDI NAVI R}

Indinavir must be consumed on an empty stomach for maximal absorption; however, if co-administered with ritonavir, it may be taken without regard to food. Oral bioavailability is about $65 \%$, and the drug has a high levÄ± of cerebrospinal fluid penetration (up to $76 \%$ of serum levels). Serum half-life is $1.5-2$ hours. Excretion is primarily fecal. An increase in AUC by $60 \%$ and in half-life to 2.8 hours in the setting of hepatic insufficiency necessitates dose reduction.

Resistance may be associated with multiple mutations, particularly at positions 46 and 82, and the number of codon alterations (typically substitutions) tends to predict the level of phenotypic resistance. Resistance to indinavir is associated with a loss of susceptibility to ritonavir.

The most common adverse effects are indirect hyperbilirubinemia and nephrolithiasis due to crystallization of tr drug. Nephrolithiasis can occur within days after initiating therapy, with an estimated incidence of 10-20\%, anc may be associated with renal failure. Consumption of at least 48 ounces of water daily is important to maintain adequate hydration and prevent nephrolithiasis. Thrombocytopenia, elevations of serum aminotransferase level nausea, diarrhea, and irritability have also been reported. Insulin resistance may be more common with indinav than with the other PI agents, occurring in 3-5\% of patients. There have also been rare cases of acute hemolyt anemia. In rats, high doses of indinavir are associated with development of thyroid adenomas.

Since indinavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, numerous and complex drug interactions can occur (Tables 49-3 and 49-4). Combination with ritonavir (boosting) allows for twice-daily rather than thrice-daily dosing and eliminate the food restriction associated with use of indinavir. However, there is potential for an increase in nephrolithiasi with this combination compared with indinavir alone; thus, a high fluid intake (1.5-2 L/d) is advised.

\section*{LOPI NAVI R/ RITONAVI R}

Lopinavir 100/ritonavir 400 is a licensed combination in which subtherapeutic doses of ritonavir inhibit the CYP3 mediated metabolism of lopinavir, thereby resulting in increased exposure to lopinavir. Trough levels of lopinavi are greater than the median HIV-1 wild-type $50 \%$ inhibitory concentration, thus maintaining potent viral suppression as well as providing a pharmacologic barrier to the emergence of resistance. In this combination, therefore, ritonavir is acting as a pharmacokinetic enhancer rather than an antiretroviral agent. In addition to
improved patient compliance due to reduced pill burden, lopinavir/ritonavir is generally well tolerated.
Absorption of lopinavir is enhanced with food. The oral solution contains alcohol. Lopinavir is extensively metabolized by the CYP3A isozyme of the hepatic cytochrome P450 system, which is inhibited by ritonavir. Sert levels of lopinavir may be increased in patients with hepatic impairment.

The most common adverse effects of lopinavir are diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and asthenia. Potential drug-drug interactions are extensive (see ritonavir and Tables 49-3 and 49-4). Increased dosage of lopinavir/ritonavir is recommended when co-administered with efavirenz or nevirapine, which induce lopinavir metabolism. Concurrent use of fosamprenavir should be avoided owing to increased exposure to lopinavir with decreased levels of amprenavir.

\section*{NELFI NAVI R}

Nelfinavir has higher absorption in the fed state (increased AUC by two- to threefold), undergoes metabolism b: CYP3A, and is excreted primarily in the feces. The plasma half-life in humans is $3.5-5$ hours. The D30N mutatio appears to be particularly closely linked with phenotypic resistance in isolates obtained from clinical trials.

The most common adverse effects associated with nelfinavir are diarrhea and flatulence. Diarrhea often respon to antidiarrheal medications but can be dose-limiting. Like other PIs, nelfinavir is an inhibitor of the CYP3A system, and multiple drug interactions may occur (Tables 49-3 and 49-4). An increased dosage of nelfinavir is recommended when co-administered with rifabutin (with a decreased dose of rifabutin), whereas a decrease in saquinavir dose is suggested with concurrent nelfinavir. Nelfinavir has a favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profile for pregnant women compared with that of other Pls (Table 49-5).

\section*{RITONAVIR}

Ritonavir is an inhibitor of HI V-1 and HIV-2 proteases with high bioavailability (about 75\%) that increases when the drug is given with food. Metabolism to an active metabolite occurs via the CYP3A and CYP2D6 isoforms; excretion is primarily in the feces. Caution is advised when administering the drug to persons with impaired hepatic function.

Resistance is associated with mutations at positions 84, 82, 71, 63, and 46, of which the I84V mutation appear: to be the most critical.

The most common adverse effects of ritonavir are gastrointestinal disturbances, paresthesias (circumoral and peripheral), elevated serum aminotransferase levels, altered taste, and hypertriglyceridemia. Nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain typically occur during the first few weeks of therapy. Slow dose escalation over 4-5 days is recommended to decrease the dose-limiting side effects. Liver adenomas and carcinomas have been induced in male mice receiving ritonavir; no similar effects have been observed to date in humans.

Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4; as such, co-administration with agents heavily metabolized by CYP3A must be approached with caution (Tables 49-3 and 49-4). In addition, therapeutic levels of digoxin and theophylline should be monitored when co-administered with ritonavir owing to likely increase in their concentrations. However, the CYP3A4 inhibitory properties of ritonavir have been exploited to raise the trough concentration and prolong the half-life of more potent and less toxic PI agents. Thus, lower than therapeutic doses of ritonavir are commonly given in combination with agents such as lopinavir, indinavir, or amprenavir to reduce the risk of resistance by increasing the time of drug exposure. Moreover, the prolonged half-life allows $f$ less frequent dosing of the other PI agent, thus enhancing adherence.

\section*{SAQUI NAVI R}

In its original formulation as a hard gel capsule (saquinavir-H; Invirase), oral saquinavir is poorly bioavailable (only about 4\% after food). It was therefore largely replaced in clinical use by a soft gel capsule formulation (saquinavir-S; Fortovase) in which absorption was increased approximately threefold. However, reformulation c saquinavir-H for once-daily dosing in combination with low-dose ritonavir (see below) has both improved antivir efficacy and decreased the gastrointestinal side effects typically associated with saquinavir-S. Moreover, coadministration of saquinavir-H with ritonavir results in blood levels of saquinavir similar to those associated witr saquinavir- $S$, thus capitalizing on the pharmacokinetic interaction of the two agents. The manufacturer announÄ± plans to discontinue the manufacture of saquinavir-S in early 2006.

The most common critical resistance mutations are L90M and G48V, conferring an approximately tenfold decrei in susceptibility to saquinavir.

Both formulations of saquinavir should be taken within 2 hours after a fatty meal for enhanced absorption. Saquinavir has a large volume of distribution, but penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid is negligible. The elimination half-life is 12 hours. Excretion is primarily in the feces. Reported adverse effects include gastrointestinal discomfort (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia; these are more common with saquinavir-S) and rhinitis.

Saquinavir is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism by CYP3A4, and functions as a CYP3A4 inhibitor as well a substrate; thus, it should be used with the same precautions regarding drug-drug interactions as are the othe PIs (Table 49-4). Co-administration with the CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir has been adopted by clinicians because the higher-and thus more efficacious-levels of saquinavir while enabling reduction in daily dose and frequency of saquinavir. A decreased dose of saquinavir is recommended when co-administered with nelfinavir. Liver function tests should be monitored if saquinavir is co-administered with delavirdine or rifampin.

\section*{TI PRANAVI R}

Tipranavir is another newer PI. Bioavailability is poor but is increased when taken with a high-fat meal. The dru is metabolized by the liver microsomal system. Tipranavir must be taken in combination with ritonavir to achiev effective serum levels. It is contraindicated in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Tipranavir contains a sulfonamide moiety and should not be administered to patients with known sulfa allergy.

The most common adverse effects are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and rash; the latter is more common in women. Liver toxicity, including life-threatening hepatic decompensation, has been observed and is more common in patients with chronic hepatitis B or C. In 2006 a black box warning was added noting a possib increase in intracranial hemorrhage in patients taking tipranavir. Other potential adverse effects include depression; elevations in total cholesterol, triglycerides, and amylase; and decreased white blood cell count.

Tipranavir both inhibits and induces the CYP3A4 system. When used in combination with ritonavir, its net effect inhibition. Tipranavir also induces P-glycoprotein transporter and thus may alter the disposition of many other drugs (see Table 49-4). Concurrent administration of tipranavir with amprenavir or saquinavir should be avoide owing to decreased blood levels of the latter drugs.

\section*{Fusion Inhibitors-Enfuvirtide}

Enfuvirtide (formerly called T-20) is the first representative of a new class of antiretroviral agents: It is a fusion inhibitor that blocks entry into the cell (Figure 49-4). Enfuvirtide, a synthetic 36-amino-acid peptide, binds to th
gp41 subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein, preventing the conformational changes required for the fusion ( the viral and cellular membranes. Enfuvirtide must be administered by subcutaneous injection. Metabolism appears to be by proteolytic hydrolysis without involvement of the CYP450 system. Elimination half-life is 3.8 hours.

Resistance to enfuvirtide can occur, and the frequency and mechanisms of this phenomenon are being investigated. However, enfuvirtide lacks cross-resistance to the other currently approved antiretroviral drug classes.

The most common adverse effects associated with enfuvirtide therapy are local injection site reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions may rarely occur, are of varying severity, and may recur on rechallenge. Eosinophilia has also been noted. No interactions have been identified that would require the alteration of the dosage of oth antiretroviral drugs.

\section*{Investigational Antiretroviral Agents}

New therapies are being sought that offer convenient dosing, lower incidence of adverse effects, new viral targets, and activity against resistant viruses. Agents under evaluation or reformulation for once-daily dosing include stavudine and nevirapine. New agents currently in advanced stages of clinical development include the NRTI agent elvucitabine, the NNRTI agents TMC-125 and TMC-278, the PI agents TMC-114* and GSK-640385, and chemokine co-receptor inhibitors to block virus entry such as maraviroc. In addition, new drug classes such as maturation inhibitors and integrase inhibitors are under clinical investigation.
*TMC-114 was licensed as darunavir in the USA in 2006, to be co-administered with ritonavir in treatmentexperienced patients with resistance to other PIs (Table 49-3).

\section*{ANTI HEPATITIS AGENTS}

Several agents effective against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are now available (Table 49-6). Although treatment is suppressive rather than curative, the high prevalence of these infections worldwic with their concomitant morbidity and mortality, reflect a critical need for improved therapeutics.

\section*{I NTERFERON ALFA}

Interferons are host cytokines that exert complex antiviral, immunomodulatory, and antiproliferative activities (see Chapter 56). Interferon (IFN)-alfa appears to function by induction of intracellular signals following binding specific cell membrane receptors, resulting in inhibition of viral penetration, translation, transcription, protein processing, maturation, and release, as well as increased expression of major histocompatibility complex antigens, enhanced phagocytic activity of macrophages, and augmentation of the proliferation and survival of cytotoxic T cells.

Injectable preparations of interferon alfa are available for treatment of both HBV and HCV virus infections (Tabl 49-6). Interferon alfa-2a and interferon alfa-2b may be administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, where interferon alfacon-1 is administered subcutaneously. Elimination half-life is 2-5 hours for interferon alfa-2a and 2b, depending on the route of administration. The half-life of interferon alfacon-1 in patients with chronic hepat C ranges from 6 hours to 10 hours. Alfa interferons are filtered at the glomeruli and undergo rapid proteolytic
degradation during tubular reabsorption, such that detection in the systemic circulation is negligible. Liver metabolism and subsequent biliary excretion are considered minor pathways.

Pegylated interferon alfa-2a and pegylated interferon alfa-2b have recently been introduced for the treatment c patients with HBV and HCV infections. Slower clearance of these agents results in substantially longer terminal half-lives and steadier drug concentrations, allowing for less frequent dosing. Renal elimination accounts for abÄ± $30 \%$ of clearance, and clearance is approximately halved in subjects with impaired renal function; dosage must therefore be adjusted.

In patients with chronic HBV infection, a recent meta-analysis of clinical trials showed that treatment with interferon alfa is associated with a higher incidence of hepatitis e antigen ( HBeAg ) seroconversion and undetectable HBV DNA levels than placebo. The addition of the pegylated moiety results in further increases in the proportion of patients with HBeAg seroconversion ( $\sim 30 \%$ ) and a decline by approximately 4 log copies $/ \mathrm{mL}$ ( $99.99 \%$ ) in HBV DNA after 1 year. Trials of the pegylated interferon alfas in chronic HCV infection are discusse below.

Typical side effects of interferon alfa include a flu-like syndrome (ie, headache, fevers, chills, myalgias, and malaise) that occurs within 6 hours after dosing in more than $30 \%$ of patients during the first week of therapy $\bar{c}$ tends to resolve upon continued administration. Transient hepatic enzyme elevations may occur in the first 8-1 weeks of therapy and appear to be more common in responders. Potential adverse effects during chronic thera| include neurotoxicities (mood disorders, depression, somnolence, confusion, seizures), myelosuppression, profound fatigue, weight loss, rash, cough, myalgia, alopecia, tinnitus, reversible hearing loss, retinopathy, pneumonitis, and possibly cardiotoxicity. Induction of autoantibodies may occur, causing exacerbation or unmasking of autoimmune or thyroid disease. The polyethylene glycol molecule is a nontoxic polymer that is readily excreted in the urine.

Contraindications to interferon alfa therapy include hepatic decompensation, autoimmune disease, and history . cardiac arrhythmia. Caution is advised in the setting of psychiatric disease, epilepsy, thyroid disease, ischemic cardiac disease, severe renal insufficiency, and cytopenia. Alfa interferons are abortifacient in primates and sho not be administered in pregnancy. Potential drug-drug interactions include increased theophylline levels and increased methadone levels. Combination therapy with NRTI agents may cause hepatic failure; in particular, co administration with didanosine is not recommended. Co-administration with zidovudine may exacerbate cytopenias.

\section*{Treatment of Hepatitis B Virus I nfection}

The most common efficacy end points in clinical trials of hepatitis B virus infection are seroconversion from HBe from positive to negative and suppression of HBV DNA to undetectable levels. These end points are correlated with improvement in necroinflammatory disease, a decreased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis, an decreased need for liver transplantation. However, because current therapies suppress HBV replication rather than eradicate the virus, initial responses may not be durable. The covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA exists in stable form indefinitely within the cell, serving as a reservoir for HBV throughout the life of the cell and resultinc in the capacity to reactivate. Relapse is more common in patients co-infected with HBV and hepatitis D virus.

As of 2006 there were three oral nucleoside/ nucleotide analogs and two injectable interferon drugs available in the United States for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. Although three of the current antiretroviral NRTIs (emtricitabine, lamivudine, and tenofovir) have potent activity against HBV, only lamivudine is approved for clinical treatment. Although not FDA-approved, tenofovir is recommended by recent consensus guidelines for th
treatment of patients co-infected with HBV and HIV-1. The anti-herpes agent famciclovir also has anti-HBV activity, but it is relatively weak and requires thrice-daily dosing. Because NRTI agents may be used in patients co-infected with hepatitis B and HIV, it is important to note that acute exacerbation of hepatitis may occur upor discontinuation or interruption of these agents.

\section*{LAMI VUDI NE}

The pharmacokinetics of lamivudine are described earlier in this chapter (see Lamivudine). The more prolonged intracellular half-life in HBV cell lines (17-19 hours) than in HIV-infected cell lines (10.5-15.5 hours) allows for lower doses and less frequent administration. Lamivudine can be safely administered to patients with decompensated liver disease.

Lamivudine inhibits HBV DNA polymerase and HIV reverse transcriptase by competing with deoxycytidine triphosphate for incorporation into the viral DNA, resulting in chain termination. Lamivudine achieves 3-4 log decreases in viral replication in most patients and suppression of HBV DNA to undetectable levels in about $44 \%$ patients. Seroconversion of HBeAg from positive to negative occurs in about $17 \%$ of patients and is durable at years in about $70 \%$ of responders. Continuation of treatment for $4-8$ months after seroconversion may improve the durability of response. Response in HBeAg-negative patients is initially high but less durable.

Chronic therapy with lamivudine in patients with hepatitis may ultimately be limited by the emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV isolates (eg, with the YMDD mutation). Resistance has been associated with flares of hepatitis and progressive liver disease. Cross-resistance between lamivudine and either emtricitabine or enteca may occur; however, cross-resistance between lamivudine and adefovir has not been reported.

In the doses used for HBV infection, lamivudine has an excellent safety profile. Headache, nausea, and dizzines are rare. Co-infection with HIV may increase the risk of pancreatitis. No evidence of mitochondrial toxicity has been reported.

\section*{ADEFOVIR DIPIVOXIL}

Although initially and abortively developed for treatment of HIV infection, adefovir dipivoxil gained approval, at lower and less toxic doses, for treatment of HBV infection. Adefovir dipivoxil is the diester prodrug of adefovir, a acyclic phosphonated adenine nucleotide analog (Figure 49-2). It is phosphorylated by cellular kinases to the active diphosphate metabolite and then competitively inhibits HBV DNA polymerase to result in chain terminatic after incorporation into the viral DNA. Naturally occuring (ie, primary) adefovir-resistant rt233 HBV mutants has recently been described.

Oral bioavailability is about $59 \%$ and is unaffected by meals. The terminal elimination half-life is approximately 7.5 hours. Adefovir is excreted by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion and thus $n$ be administered to patients with decompensated liver disease.

Recent placebo-controlled trials showed that adefovir resulted in a mean of 3.5 logs reduction of HBV DNA copies $/ \mathrm{mL}$, normalization of aspartate aminotransferase in $48 \%-72 \%$ of patients, and improvement in liver histology and fibrosis in $53 \%-64 \%$ of patients at 48 weeks. More prolonged therapy results in higher rates of response, with anti-HBeAg seroconversion in $23 \%$ by 72 weeks and improved inflammation and fibrosis on liver biopsy at 5 years. Although emergence of resistance during therapy is rare ( $\sim 4 \%$ after 3 years of use), specific mutations have been associated with viral rebound. There is no cross-resistance between adefovir and lamivudine.

Adefovir dipivoxil is well tolerated. A dose-dependent nephrotoxicity has been observed in clinical trials, manifested by increased serum creatinine with decreased serum phosphorous and more common in patients wi baseline renal insufficiency. Other potential adverse effects are headache, diarrhea, asthenia, and abdominal pain. As with other NRTI agents, lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis are considered a risk owing to mitochondr dysfunction. Adefovir is embryotoxic in rats.

\section*{ENTECAVIR}

Entecavir is an orally administered guanosine nucleoside analog (Figure 49-2) that competitively inhibits all thrÄ± functions of HBV DNA polymerase, including base priming, reverse transcription of the negative strand, and synthesis of the positive strand of HBV DNA. Oral bioavailability approaches $100 \%$ but is decreased by food; therefore, entecavir should be taken on an empty stomach. The intracellular half-life of the active phosphorylat compound is 15 hours. It is excreted by the kidney, undergoing both glomerular filtration and net tubular secretion.

Comparison with lamivudine in patients with chronic HBV infection demonstrated similar rates of HBeAg seroconversion but significantly higher rates of HBV DNA viral suppression with entecavir, normalization of seru alanine aminotransferase levels, and histologic improvement in the liver. No primary resistance was observed $t_{1}$ emerge after entecavir use for up to 48 weeks. However, decreased susceptibility to entecavir occurs in association with lamivudine resistance. Adefovir maintains activity against entecavir-resistant strains.

Entecavir is well tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse events are headache, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. Lung adenomas and carcinomas in mice, hepatic adenomas and carcinomas in rats and mice, vascular tumors in mice, and brain gliomas and skin fibromas in rats have been observed at varying exposures. Coadministration of entecavir with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of either entecavir or the co-administered drug.

\section*{I NVESTI GATI ONAL AGENTS}

Compounds in advanced stages of clinical development for the treatment of patients with HBV infection include the nucleoside/nucleotide analogs clevudine, telbivudine, valtorcitabine, and alamifovir, as well as the immunologic modulator thymosin alpha-1, agents that facilitate uptake by the liver using conjugation to ligands and RNA interference compounds.

\section*{Treatment of Hepatitis C I nfection}

The primary goal of treatment in patients with HCV infection is viral eradication. In clinical trials, the primary efficacy end point is typically achievement of sustained viral response (SVR), defined as the absence of detecta viremia for 6 months after completion of therapy. SVR is associated with improvement in liver histology and reduction in risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and occasionally with regression of cirrhosis as well. Late relapse occurs in fewer than $5 \%$ of patients who achieve SVR.

In acute hepatitis C , the rate of clearance of the virus without therapy is estimated to be $15-30 \%$. In one (uncontrolled) study, treatment of acute infection with interferon alfa-2b, in doses higher than those used for chronic hepatitis C (Table 49-6), resulted in a sustained rate of clearance of 95\% at 6 months. Therefore, if HC RNA testing documents persistent viremia 12 weeks after initial seroconversion, antiviral therapy is recommended.

The current standard of treatment in patients with chronic HCV infection is once-weekly pegylated interferon alf
in combination with daily oral ribavirin. Pegylated interferon alfa-2a and $-2 b$ have replaced their unmodified interferon alfa counterparts because of superior efficacy in combination with ribavirin, regardless of genotype. I also clear that combination therapy with oral ribavirin is more effective than monotherapy with either interferon ribavirin alone. Therefore, monotherapy with pegylated interferon alfa is recommended only in patients who cannot tolerate ribavirin. Factors associated with a favorable response to therapy include HCV genotype 2 or 3, absence of cirrhosis on liver biopsy, and low pretreatment HCV RNA levels.

\section*{RIBAVIRIN}

Ribavirin is a guanosine analog that is phosphorylated intracellularly by host cell enzymes. Although its mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, it appears to interfere with the synthesis of guanosine triphosphate, to inhibit capping of viral messenger RNA, and to inhibit the viral RNA-dependent polymerase of certain viruses. Ribavirin triphosphate inhibits the replication of a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses, including influenza A and B, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, paramyxoviruses, HCV, and HIV-1.

The absolute oral bioavailability of ribavirin is about $64 \%$, increases with high-fat meals, and decreases with coadministration of antacids. Ribavirin elimination is primarily through the urine; therefore, clearance is decrease ( in patients with creatinine clearances less than $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$.

Evidence suggests that both a higher dose (ie, > $10.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) and a longer duration of ribavirin therapy, in combination with one of the interferon alfas, may improve response. This must be balanced with an increased likelihood of toxicity. A dose-dependent hemolytic anemia occurs in 10-20\% of patients. Other potential advers effects are depression, fatigue, irritability, rash, cough, insomnia, nausea, and pruritus. Contraindications to ribavirin therapy include uncorrected anemia, end-stage renal failure, ischemic vascular disease, and pregnanc! Ribavirin is teratogenic and embryotoxic in animals as well as mutagenic in mammalian cells. Patients exposed the drug should not conceive children for at least 6 months thereafter.

\section*{I NVESTI GATI ONAL AGENTS}

Investigational agents for the treatment of HCV infection include inhibitors of the HCV RNA polymerase such as valopicitabine, the nucleoside analogs isatoribine and viramidine, monoclonal antibodies against the glycoprotei several new types of interferons, congeners of ribavirin, Pls, and the immunomodulator thymosin alpha-1.

\section*{ANTI-I NFLUENZA AGENTS}

Influenza virus strains are classified by their core proteins (ie, A, B, or C), species of origin (eg, avian, swine), a geographic site of isolation. Influenza A, the only strain that causes pandemics, is classified into 16 H (hemagglutinin) and 9 N (neuraminidase) known subtypes based on surface proteins. Although influenza B viruses usually infect only people, influenza A viruses can infect a variety of animal hosts. Current influenza A subtypes that are circulating among people worldwide include H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. Fifteen subtypes are known to infect birds, providing an extensive reservoir. Although avian influenza subtypes are typically highly species-specific, they have on rare occasions crossed the species barrier to infect humans and cats. Viruses of 1 H5 and H7 subtypes (eg, H5N1, H7N7, and H7N3) may rapidly mutate within poultry flocks from a low to high pathogenic form and have recently expanded their host range to cause both avian and human disease. Of particular concern is the H5N1 virus, which first caused human infection (including severe disease and death) ir 1997 and has become endemic in Southeast Asia poultry since 2003. It is feared that the virus will become transmissible from person to person rather than solely from poultry to human, thus initiating the potential for a
global outbreak (ie, pandemic).
Although both classes of antiviral drugs available for influenza have activity against influenza A, many or most c the circulating strains of avian H5N1, as well as the H1 and H3 strains causing seasonal influenza in the United States, are resistant to the adamantanamine agents.

\section*{AMANTADINE \& RI MANTADI NE}

Amantadine (1-aminoadamantane hydrochloride) and its a-methyl derivative, rimantadine, are cyclic amines of the adamantine family that block the M2 proton ion channel of the virus particle and inhibit uncoating of the viri RNA within infected host cells, thus preventing its replication. They are active against influenza A only.
Rimantadine is four to ten times more active than amantadine in vitro. Amantadine is excreted unchanged in th urine, whereas rimantadine undergoes extensive metabolism by hydroxylation, conjugation, and glucuronidatio before urinary excretion. Dose reductions are required for both agents in the elderly and in patients with renal insufficiency and for rimantadine in patients with marked hepatic insufficiency.

In the absence of resistance, both amantadine and rimantadine, at 100 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily, ar $70-90 \%$ protective in the prevention of clinical illness when initiated before exposure. When begun within 1-2 days after the onset of illness, the duration of fever and systemic symptoms is reduced by 1-2 days.

The primary target for both agents is the M2 protein within the viral membrane, incurring both influenza A specificity and a mutation-prone site that results in the rapid development of resistance in up to $50 \%$ of treatec individuals. Resistant isolates with single-point mutation are genetically stable, retain pathogenicity, can be transmitted to close contacts, and may be shed chronically by immunocompromised patients. The prevalence o resistance to both agents in clinical isolates in the United States increased from 2\% in the 2003-2004 influenza season, to 12\% in 2004-2005, to an alarming 91\% in 2005-2006 (99\% in H3N2, 1\% in H1N1). Cross-resistanc to zanamivir and oseltamivir does not occur.

The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal (nausea, anorexia) and central nervous system (nervousness, difficulty in concentrating, insomnia, light-headedness). Central nervous system toxicity may be due to alteration of dopamine neurotransmission (see Chapter 28), is less frequent with rimantadine than with amantadine, tends to diminish after the first week of use, and may increase with concomitant antihistamines, anticholinergic drugs, hydrochlorothiazide, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Serious neurotoxic reactions, occasionally fatal, may occur in association with high amantadine plasma concentrations and are more likely in the elderly or with renal insufficiency. Peripheral edema is another potential adverse effect. Both agents are teratogenic in rodents, and birth defects have been reported after exposure during pregnancy.

\section*{ZANAMI VI R \& OSELTAMI VI R}

The neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir, analogs of sialic acid, interfere with release of progeny influenza virus from infected to new host cells, thus halting the spread of infection within the respiratory tract. Unlike amantadine and rimantadine, zanamivir and oseltamivir have activity against both influenza A and influenza B viruses. Early administration is crucial because replication of influenza virus peaks at 24-72 hours after the onset of illness. When a 5-day course of therapy is initiated within 36-48 hours after the onset of symptoms, the duration of illness is decreased by 1-2 days compared with those on placebo, severity is diminished, and the incidence of secondary complications in children and adults decreases. Once-daily prophyla is $70-90 \%$ effective in preventing disease after exposure. Oseltamivir is FDA-approved for patients 1 year and older, whereas zanamivir is approved in patients 7 years or older.

Zanamivir is delivered directly to the respiratory tract via inhalation. Ten to twenty percent of the active compound reaches the lungs, and the remainder is deposited in the oropharynx. The concentration of the drug the respiratory tract is estimated to be more than 1000 times the $50 \%$ inhibitory concentration for neuraminidase. Five to fifteen percent of the total dose ( 10 mg twice daily for treatment and 10 mg once daily 1 prevention) is absorbed and excreted in the urine with minimal metabolism. Potential side effects include cough bronchospasm (occasionally severe), reversible decrease in pulmonary function, and transient nasal and throat discomfort.

Oseltamivir is an orally administered prodrug that is activated by hepatic esterases and widely distributed throughout the body. The dosage is 75 mg twice daily for treatment and 75 mg once daily for prevention; dosa must be modified in patients with renal insufficiency. The half-life of oseltamivir is $6-10$ hours, and excretion is primarily in the urine. Potential side effects include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which occur in $5-10^{\prime}$ of patients early in therapy but tend to resolve spontaneously. Taking oseltamivir with food does not interfere $u$ absorption and may decrease nausea and vomiting. Headache, fatigue, and diarrhea have also been reported a appear to be more common with prophylactic use.

In adults, resistance during therapy is rare but may cause fatal disease. It is unknown whether resistant mutan retain pathogenicity or are spread between people. Worldwide resistance is rare and has not been documented any clinical isolate from the 2005-2006 influenza season to date in the USA. Avian influenza is expected to reta susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors.

\section*{OTHER ANTI VI RAL AGENTS}

\section*{I NTERFERONS}

Interferons have been studied for numerous clinical indications. In addition to HBV and HCV infections (see Antihepatitis Agents), intralesional injection of interferon alfa-2b or alfa-n3 may be used for treatment of condylomata acuminata (see also Chapter 62).

\section*{RIBAVIRIN}

In addition to oral administration for hepatitis C infection in combination with interferon alfa, aerosolized ribaviri is administered by nebulizer ( $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}$ for 12-18 hours per day) to children and infants with severe respirator syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis or pneumonia to reduce the severity and duration of illness. Aerosolized ribavirin has also been used to treat influenza A and B infections but has not gained widespread use. Aerosolize ribavirin is generally well tolerated but may cause conjunctival or bronchial irritation. Health care workers shoul be protected against extended inhalation exposure.

Intravenous ribavirin decreases mortality in patients with Lassa fever and other viral hemorrhagic fevers if start early. High concentrations inhibit West Nile virus in vitro, but clinical data are lacking. Clinical benefit has been reported in cases of severe measles pneumonitis and certain encephalitides, and continuous infusion of ribavirir has decreased virus shedding in several patients with severe lower respiratory tract influenza or parainfluenza infections. At steady state, cerebrospinal fluid levels are about $70 \%$ of those in plasma.

\section*{PALI VI ZUMAB}

Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope in the A antigen site on the F surfi protein of RSV. It is licensed for the prevention of RSV infection in high-risk infants and children such as premature infants and those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or congenital heart disease. A placebo-controllec
trial using once-monthly intramuscular injections ( $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) for 5 months beginning at the start of the RSV season demonstrated a 55\% reduction in the risk of hospitalization for RSV in treated patients, as well as decreases in the need for supplemental oxygen, illness severity score, and need for intensive care. Although resistant strains have been isolated in the laboratory, no resistant clinical isolates have yet been identified. Potential adverse effects include upper respiratory tract infection, fever, rhinitis, rash, diarrhea, vomiting, cougl otitis media, and elevation in serum aminotransferase levels.

\section*{I MI QUI MOD}

Imiquimod is an immune response modifier shown to be effective in the topical treatment of external genital an perianal warts (ie, condyloma acuminatum; see Chapter 62). The mechanism of action against these human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced lesions is unknown. The $5 \%$ cream is applied three times weekly and washed off 6-10 hours after each application. Recurrences appear to be less common than after ablative therapies. Imiquimod is also effective against actinic keratoses. Local skin reactions are the most common side effect; the resolve within weeks after therapy. However, pigmentary skin changes may persist. Systemic adverse effects such as fatigue and influenza-like syndrome have occasionally been reported.

\section*{METRONI DAZOLE, MUPI ROCI N, POLYMYXI NS, \& URI NARY ANTI SEPTI CS \\ \section*{METRONIDAZOLE}}

Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole antiprotozoal drug (see Chapter 53) that also has potent antibacterial activity against anaerobes, including bacteroides and clostridium species. It is well absorbed after oral administration, is widely distributed in tissues, and reaches serum levels of $4-6 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ after a $250-\mathrm{mg}$ oral dose. Metronidazole can also be given intravenously or by rectal suppository. The drug penetrates well into the cerebrospinal fluid and brain, reaching levels similar to those in serum. Metronidazole is metabolized in the liver and may accumulate in hepatic insufficiency.

Metronidazole is indicated for treatment of anaerobic or mixed intra-abdominal infections, vaginitis (trichomonas infection, bacterial vaginosis), C difficile colitis, and brain abscess. The typical dosage is 500 mg three times daily orally or intravenously ( $30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ). Vaginitis may respond to a single 2-g dose. A vaginal gel is available for topical use.

Adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, stomatitis, and peripheral neuropathy with prolonged use. Metronidazole has a disulfiram-like effect, and patients should be instructed to avoid alcohol. Although teratogenic in some animals, metronidazole has not been associated with this effect in humans. Other properties of metronidazole are discussed in Chapter 53.

A structurally similar agent, tinidazole, is a once-daily drug approved for treatment of trichomonas infection, giardiasis, and amebiasis. It also is active against anaerobic bacteria, but is not FDA-approved for treatment of anaerobic infections.

\section*{MUPIROCIN}

Mupirocin (pseudomonic acid) is a natural product produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens. It is rapidly inactivated after absorption, and systemic levels are undetectable. It is available as an ointment for topical application.

Mupirocin is active against gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Mupirocin inhibits staphylococcal isoleucyl tRNA synthetase. Low-level resistance, defined as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of up to $100 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$, is due to point mutation in the gene of the target enzyme. Low-level resistance has been observed after prolonged use. However, local concentrations achieved with topical application are well above this MIC, and this level of resistance appears not to result in clinical failure. High-level resistance, with MICs exceeding $1000 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$, is due to the presence of a second isoleucyl tRNA synthetase gene, which is plasmid-encoded. High-level resistance results in complete loss of activity. Strains with high-level resistance have caused nosocomial (hospital) outbreaks of staphylococcal infection and colonization. Although higher rates of resistance are encountered with intensive use of mupirocin, more than $95 \%$ of staphylococcal isolates are still susceptible.

Mupirocin is indicated for topical treatment of minor skin infections, such as impetigo (see Chapter 62). Topical application over large infected areas, such as decubitus ulcers or open surgical wounds, has been identified as an important factor leading to emergence of mupirocin-resistant strains and is not recommended. Mupirocin effectively eliminates $S$ aureus nasal carriage by patients or health care workers,
but results are mixed with respect to its ability to prevent subsequent staphylococcal infection.

\section*{POLYMYXI NS}

The polymyxins are a group of basic peptides active against gram-negative bacteria and include polymyxin B and polymyxin E (colistin) . Polymyxins act like cationic detergents. They attach to and disrupt bacterial cell membranes. They also bind and inactivate endotoxin. Gram-positive organisms, proteus, and neisseria are resistant.

Owing to their significant toxicity with systemic administration, polymyxins have been largely restricted to topical use. Ointments containing polymyxin B, $0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{g}$, in mixtures with bacitracin or neomycin (or both) are commonly applied to infected superficial skin lesions. Emergence of strains of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that are resistant to all other agents has led to renewed interest in polymixins, eg, colistin as a parenteral agent for salvage therapy of infections caused by these organisms.

\section*{URI NARY ANTI SEPTI CS}

Urinary antiseptics are oral agents that exert antibacterial activity in the urine but have little or no systemic antibacterial effect. Their usefulness is limited to lower urinary tract infections. Prolonged suppression of bacteriuria by means of urinary antiseptics may be desirable in chronic urinary tract infections in which eradication of infection by short-term systemic therapy has not been possible.

\section*{Nitrofurantoin}

Nitrofurantoin is bacteriostatic and bactericidal for many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria but P aeruginosa and many strains of proteus are resistant. There is no cross-resistance between nitrofurantoin and other antimicrobial agents and resistance emerges slowly. As Escherichia coli resistant to trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones has become more common, nitrofurantoin has become an important alternative oral agent for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection.

Nitrofurantoin is well absorbed after ingestion. It is metabolized and excreted so rapidly that no systemic antibacterial action is achieved. The drug is excreted into the urine by both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. With average daily doses, concentrations of $200 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ are reached in urine. In renal failure, urine levels are insufficient for antibacterial action, but high blood levels may cause toxicity. Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with significant renal insufficiency.

The dose for urinary tract infection in adults is 100 mg orally taken four times daily. It should not be used to treat upper urinary tract infection. Oral nitrofurantoin can be given for months for the suppression of chronic urinary tract infection. It is desirable to keep urinary pH below 5.5, which greatly enhances drug activity. A single daily dose of nitrofurantoin, 100 mg , can prevent recurrent urinary tract infections in some women.

Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting are the principal side effects of nitrofurantoin. Neuropathies and hemolytic anemia occur in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Nitrofurantoin antagonizes the action of nalidixic acid. Rashes, pulmonary infiltration and fibrosis, and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported.

\section*{Methenamine Mandelate \& Methenamine Hippurate}

Methenamine mandelate is the salt of mandelic acid and methenamine and possesses properties of both of these urinary antiseptics. Methenamine hippurate is the salt of hippuric acid and methenamine. Below pH
5.5, methenamine releases formaldehyde, which is antibacterial. Mandelic acid or hippuric acid taken orally is excreted unchanged in the urine, in which these drugs are bactericidal for some gram-negative bacteria when pH is less than 5.5.

Methenamine mandelate, 1 g four times daily, or methenamine hippurate, 1 g twice daily by mouth (children, $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ or $30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$, respectively), is used only as a urinary antiseptic to suppress, not treat, urinary tract infection. Acidifying agents (eg, ascorbic acid, $4-12 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ ) may be given to lower urinary pH below 5.5. Sulfonamides should not be given at the same time because they may form an insoluble compound with the formaldehyde released by methenamine. Persons taking methenamine mandelate may exhibit falsely elevated tests for catecholamine metabolites.

\section*{DI SI NFECTANTS, ANTI SEPTI CS, \& STERI LANTS}

Disinfectants are strong chemical agents that inhibit or kill microorganisms (Table 50-1). Antiseptics are disinfecting agents with sufficiently low toxicity for host cells that they can be used directly on skin, mucous membranes, or wounds. Sterilants kill both vegetative cells and spores when applied to materials for appropriate times and temperatures. Some of the terms used in this context are defined in Table 50-2.

\section*{Table 50-2. Commonly Used Terms Related to Chemical and Physical Killing of Microorganisms.}

\section*{Antisepsis}

Application of an agent to living tissue for the purpose of preventing infection

\section*{Decontamination}

Destruction or marked reduction in number or activity of microorganisms

\section*{Disinfection}

Chemical or physical treatment that destroys most vegetative microbes or viruses, but not spores, in or on inanimate surfaces

\section*{Sanitization}

Reduction of microbial load on an inanimate surface to a level considered acceptable for public health purposes

\section*{Sterilization}

A process intended to kill or remove all types of microorganisms, including spores, and usually including viruses with an acceptable low probability of survival

\section*{Pasteurization}

A process that kills nonsporulating microorganisms by hot water or steam at $65-100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

Disinfection prevents infection by reducing the number of potentially infective organisms by killing, removing, or diluting them. Disinfection can be accomplished by application of chemical agents or use of physical agents such as ionizing radiation, dry or moist heat, or superheated steam (autoclave, $120^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) to kill microorganisms. Often a combination of agents is used, eg, water and moderate heat over time (pasteurization); ethylene oxide and moist heat (a sterilant); or addition of disinfectant to a detergent. Prevention of infection also can be achieved by washing, which dilutes the potentially infectious organism,
or by establishing a barrier, eg, gloves, condom, or respirator, which prevents the pathogen from entry into the host.

Handwashing is the most important means of preventing transmission of infectious agents from person to person or from regions of high microbial load, eg, mouth, nose, or gut, to potential sites of infection. Soap and warm water efficiently and effectively remove bacteria. Skin disinfectants along with detergent and water are usually used preoperatively as a surgical scrub for surgeons' hands and the patient's surgical incision.

Evaluation of effectiveness of antiseptics, disinfectants, and sterilants, although seemingly simple in principle, is very complex. Factors in any evaluation include the intrinsic resistance of the microorganism, the number of microorganisms present, mixed populations of organisms, amount of organic material present (eg, blood, feces, tissue), concentration and stability of disinfectant or sterilant, time and temperature of exposure, pH , and hydration and binding of the agent to surfaces. Specific, standardized assays of activity are defined for each use. Toxicity for humans also must be evaluated. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates disinfectants and sterilants and the Food and Drug Administration regulates antiseptics.

Users of antiseptics, disinfectants, and sterilants need to consider their short-term and long-term toxicity because they may have general biocidal activity and may accumulate in the environment or in the body of the patient or caregiver using the agent. Disinfectants and antiseptics may also become contaminated by resistant microorganisms-eg, spores, P aeruginosa, or Serratia marcescens -and actually transmit infection. Most topical antiseptics interfere with wound healing to some degree. Simple cleansing with soap and water is less damaging than antiseptics to wounds. Topical antibiotics with a narrow spectrum of action and low toxicity (eg, bacitracin and mupirocin) can be used for temporary control of bacterial growth and are generally preferred to antiseptics. Methenamine mandelate releases formaldehyde in a low antibacterial concentration at acid pH and can be an effective urinary antiseptic for long-term control of urinary tract infections.

Some of the chemical classes of antiseptics, disinfectants, and sterilants are described briefly in the text that follows. The reader is referred to the general references for descriptions of physical disinfection and sterilization methods.

\section*{ALCOHOLS}

The two alcohols most frequently used for antisepsis and disinfection are ethanol and isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol). They are rapidly active, killing vegetative bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and many fungi and inactivating lipophilic viruses. The optimum bactericidal concentration is $60-90 \%$ by volume in water. They probably act by denaturation of proteins. They are not used as sterilants because they are not sporicidal, do not penetrate protein-containing organic material, may not be active against hydrophilic viruses, and lack residual action because they evaporate completely. The alcohols are useful in situations in which sinks with running water are not available for washing with soap and water. Their skin-drying effect can be partially alleviated by addition of emollients to the formulation. Use of alcohol-based hand rubs has been shown to reduce transmission of nosocomial bacterial pathogens and is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as the preferred method of hand decontamination. Alcohol-based hand rubs are ineffective against spores of Clostridium difficile and assiduous handwashing with a disinfectant soap and water is still required for decontamination after caring for a patient with infection from
this organism.
Alcohols are flammable and must be stored in cool, well-ventilated areas. They must be allowed to evaporate before cautery, electrosurgery, or laser surgery. Alcohols may be damaging if applied directly to corneal tissue. Therefore, instruments such as tonometers that have been disinfected in alcohol should be rinsed with sterile water, or the alcohol should be allowed to evaporate before they are used.

\section*{CHLORHEXI DI NE}

Chlorhexidine is a cationic biguanide with very low water solubility. Water-soluble chlorhexidine digluconate is used in water-based formulations as an antiseptic. It is active against vegetative bacteria and mycobacteria and has moderate activity against fungi and viruses. It strongly adsorbs to bacterial membranes, causing leakage of small molecules and precipitation of cytoplasmic proteins. It is active at pH 5.5-7.0. Chlorhexidine gluconate is slower in its action than alcohols, but because of its persistence it has residual activity when used repeatedly, producing bactericidal action equivalent to alcohols. It is most effective against gram-positive cocci and less active against gram-positive and gram-negative rods. Spore germination is inhibited by chlorhexidine. Chlorhexidine digluconate is resistant to inhibition by blood and organic materials. However, anionic and nonionic agents in moisturizers, neutral soaps, and surfactants may neutralize its action. Chlorhexidine digluconate formulations of 4\% concentration have slightly greater antibacterial activity than newer 2\% formulations. Chlorhexidine 0.5\% in 70\% alcohol formulations are available in some countries. Chlorhexidine has a very low skin-sensitizing or irritating capacity. Oral toxicity is low because it is poorly absorbed from the alimentary tract. Chlorhexidine must not be used during surgery on the middle ear because it causes sensorineural deafness. Similar neural toxicity may be encountered during neurosurgery.

\section*{HALOGENS}

\section*{I odine}

Iodine in a $1: 20,000$ solution is bactericidal in 1 minute and kills spores in 15 minutes. Tincture of iodine USP contains 2\% iodine and 2.4\% sodium iodide in alcohol. It is the most active antiseptic for intact skin. It is not commonly used because of serious hypersensitivity reactions that may occur and because of its staining of clothing and dressings.

\section*{l odophors}

Iodophors are complexes of iodine with a surface-active agent such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP; povidone-iodine). Iodophors retain the activity of iodine. They kill vegetative bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and lipid-containing viruses. They may be sporicidal upon prolonged exposure. Iodophors can be used as antiseptics or disinfectants, the latter containing more iodine. The amount of free iodine is low, but it is released as the solution is diluted. An iodophor solution must be diluted according to the manufacturer's directions to obtain full activity.

Iodophors are less irritating and less likely to produce skin hypersensitivity than tincture of iodine. They act as rapidly as chlorhexidine and have a broader spectrum of action, including sporicidal action, but they lack the persistent action of chlorhexidine.

\section*{Chlorine}

Chlorine is a strong oxidizing agent and universal disinfectant that is most commonly provided as a $5.25 \%$
sodium hypochlorite solution, a typical formulation for household bleach. Because formulations may vary, the exact concentration should be verified on the label. A 1:10 dilution of household bleach provides 5000 ppm of available chlorine. The CDC recommends this concentration for disinfection of blood spills. Less than 5 ppm kills vegetative bacteria, whereas up to 5000 ppm is necessary to kill spores. A concentration of 1000-10,000 ppm is tuberculocidal. One hundred ppm kills vegetative fungal cells in 1 hour, but fungal spores require 500 ppm. Viruses are inactivated by $200-500 \mathrm{ppm}$. Dilutions of $5.25 \%$ sodium hypochlorite made up in pH 7.5-8.0 tap water retain their activity for months when kept in tightly closed, opaque containers. Frequent opening and closing of the container reduces the activity markedly.

Because chlorine is inactivated by blood, serum, feces, and protein-containing materials, surfaces should be cleaned before chlorine disinfectant is applied. Undissociated hypochlorous acid (HOCI) is the active biocidal agent. When pH is increased, the less active hypochlorite ion, $\mathrm{OCl}^{-}$is formed. When hypochlorite solutions contact formaldehyde, the carcinogen bis- chloromethyl is formed. Rapid evolution of irritating chlorine gas occurs when hypochlorite solutions are mixed with acid and urine. Solutions are corrosive to aluminum, silver, and stainless steel.

Alternative chlorine-releasing compounds include chlorine dioxide and chloramine T. These agents retain chlorine longer and have a prolonged bactericidal action.

\section*{PHENOLICS}

Phenol itself (perhaps the oldest of the surgical antiseptics) is no longer used even as a disinfectant because of its corrosive effect on tissues, its toxicity when absorbed, and its carcinogenic effect. These adverse actions are diminished by forming derivatives in which a functional group replaces a hydrogen atom in the aromatic ring. The phenolic agents most commonly used are o- phenylphenol, o- benzyl-pchlorophenol, and p- tertiary amylphenol. Mixtures of phenolic derivatives are often used. Some of these are derived from coal tar distillates, eg, cresols and xylenols. Skin absorption and skin irritation still occur with these derivatives, and appropriate care is necessary in their use. Detergents are often added to formulations to clean and remove organic material that may decrease the activity of a phenolic compound.

Phenolic compounds disrupt cell walls and membranes, precipitate proteins, and inactivate enzymes. They are bactericidal (including mycobacteria) and fungicidal and they are capable of inactivating lipophilic viruses. They are not sporicidal. Dilution and time of exposure recommendations of the manufacturer must be followed.

Phenolic disinfectants are used for hard surface decontamination in hospitals and laboratories, eg, floors, beds, and counter or bench tops. They are not recommended for use in nurseries and especially in bassinets, where their use has been associated with hyperbilirubinemia. Use of hexachlorophene as a skin disinfectant has caused cerebral edema and convulsions in premature infants and occasionally in adults.

\section*{QUATERNARY AMMONIUM COMPOUNDS}

The quaternary ammonium compounds ("quats") are cationic surface-active detergents. The active cation has at least one long water-repellent hydrocarbon chain, which causes the molecules to concentrate as an oriented layer on the surface of solutions and colloidal or suspended particles. The charged nitrogen portion of the cation has high affinity for water and prevents separation out of solution. The bactericidal action of quaternary compounds has been attributed to inactivation of energy-producing enzymes, denaturation of
proteins, and disruption of the cell membrane. These agents are bacteriostatic, fungistatic, and sporistatic and also inhibit algae. They are bactericidal for gram-positive bacteria and moderately active against gramnegative bacteria. Lipophilic viruses are inactivated. They are not tuberculocidal or sporicidal, and they do not inactivate hydrophilic viruses. Quaternary ammonium compounds bind to the surface of colloidal protein in blood, serum, and milk and to the fibers in cotton, mops, cloths, and paper towels used to apply them, which can cause inactivation of the agent by removing it from solution. They are inactivated by anionic detergents (soaps), by many nonionic detergents, and by calcium, magnesium, ferric, and aluminum ions.

Quaternary compounds are used for sanitation of noncritical surfaces (floors, bench tops, etc). Their low toxicity has led to their use as sanitizers in food production facilities. CDC recommends that quaternary ammonium compounds such as benzalkonium chloride not be used as antiseptics because several outbreaks of infections have occurred that were due to growth of pseudomonas and other gram-negative bacteria in quaternary ammonium antiseptic solutions.

\section*{ALDEHYDES}

Formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde are used for disinfection or sterilization of instruments such as fiberoptic endoscopes, respiratory therapy equipment, hemodialyzers, and dental handpieces that cannot withstand exposure to the high temperatures of steam sterilization. They are not corrosive for metal, plastic, or rubber. These agents have a broad spectrum of activity against microorganisms and viruses. They act by alkylation of chemical groups in proteins and nucleic acids. Failures of disinfection or sterilization can occur as a result of dilution below the known effective concentration, the presence of organic material, and the failure of liquid to penetrate into small channels in the instruments. Automatic circulating baths are available that increase penetration of aldehyde solution into the instrument while decreasing exposure of the operator to irritating fumes.

Formaldehyde is available as a $40 \% \mathrm{w} / \mathrm{v}$ solution in water ( $100 \%$ formalin). An 8\% formaldehyde solution in water has a broad spectrum of activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Sporicidal activity may take as long as 18 hours. Its rapidity of action is increased by solution in $70 \%$ isopropanol. Formaldehyde solutions are used for high-level disinfection of hemodialyzers, preparation of vaccines, and preservation and embalming of tissues. The 4\% formaldehyde (10\% formalin) solutions used for fixation of tissues and embalming may not be mycobactericidal.

Glutaraldehyde is a dialdehyde (1,5-pentanedial). Solutions of $2 \% \mathrm{w} / \mathrm{v}$ glutaraldehyde are most commonly used. The solution must be alkalinized to $\mathrm{pH} 7.4-8.5$ for activation. Activated solutions are bactericidal, sporicidal, fungicidal, and virucidal for both lipophilic and hydrophilic viruses. Glutaraldehyde has greater sporicidal activity than formaldehyde, but its tuberculocidal activity may be less. Lethal action against mycobacteria and spores may require prolonged exposure. Once activated, solutions have a shelf life of 14 days, after which polymerization reduces activity. Other means of activation and stabilization can increase the shelf life. Because glutaraldehyde solutions are frequently reused, the most common reason for loss of activity is dilution and exposure to organic material. Test strips to measure residual activity are recommended.

Formaldehyde has a characteristic pungent odor and is highly irritating to respiratory mucous membranes and eyes at concentrations of 2-5 ppm. OSHA has declared that formaldehyde is a potential carcinogen and has established an employee exposure standard that limits the 8 -hour time-weighted average (TWA) exposure to 0.75 ppm . Protection of health care workers from exposure to glutaraldehyde concentrations
greater than 0.2 ppm is advisable. Increased air exchange, enclosure in hoods with exhausts, tight-fitting lids on exposure devices, and use of protective personal equipment such as goggles, respirators, and gloves may be necessary to achieve these exposure limits.

Ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA) is a phenolic dialdehyde chemical sterilant with a spectrum of activity comparable to glutaraldehyde, although it is several times more rapidly bactericidal. OPA solution typically contains $0.55 \%$ OPA. Its label claim is that high-level disinfection can be achieved at 12 minutes at room temperature compared with 45 minutes for $2.4 \%$ glutaraldehyde. Unlike glutaraldehyde, OPA requires no activation, is less irritating to mucous membranes, and does not require exposure monitoring. It has good materials compatibility and an acceptable environmental safety profile. OPA is useful for disinfection or sterilization of endoscopes, surgical instruments, and other medical devices.

\section*{SUPEROXI DIZED WATER}

Electrolysis of saline yields a mixture of oxidants, primarily hypochlorous acid and chlorine, with potent disinfectant and sterilant properties. The solution generated by the process, which has been commercialized and marketed as Sterilox for disinfection of endoscopes and dental materials, is rapidly bactericidal, fungicidal, tuberculocidal, and sporicidal. High-level disinfection is achieved with a contact time of 10 minutes. The solution is nontoxic and nonirritating and requires no special disposal precautions.

\section*{PEROXYGEN COMPOUNDS}

The peroxygen compounds, hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid, have high killing activity and a broad spectrum against bacteria, spores, viruses, and fungi when used in appropriate concentration. They have the advantage that their decomposition products are not toxic and do not injure the environment. They are powerful oxidizers that are used primarily as disinfectants and sterilants.

Hydrogen peroxide is a very effective disinfectant when used for inanimate objects or materials with low organic content such as water. Organisms with the enzymes catalase and peroxidase rapidly degrade hydrogen peroxide. The innocuous degradation products are oxygen and water. Concentrated solutions containing $90 \% \mathrm{w} / \mathrm{v} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ are prepared electrochemically. When diluted in high-quality deionized water to $6 \%$ and $3 \%$ and put into clean containers, they remain stable. Hydrogen peroxide has been proposed for disinfection of respirators, acrylic resin implants, plastic eating utensils, soft contact lenses, and cartons intended to contain milk or juice products. Concentrations of $10-25 \%$ hydrogen peroxide are sporicidal. Vapor phase hydrogen peroxide (VPHP) is a cold gaseous sterilant that has the potential to replace the toxic or carcinogenic gases ethylene oxide and formaldehyde. VPHP does not require a pressurized chamber and is active at temperatures as low as $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and concentrations as low as $4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$. It is incompatible with liquids and cellulose products. It penetrates the surface of some plastics. Automated equipment using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (eg, Sterrad) or hydrogen peroxide mixed with formic acid (Endoclens) is available for sterilizing endoscopes.

Peracetic acid ( $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOOH}$ ) is prepared commercially from $90 \%$ hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, and sulfuric acid as a catalyst. It is explosive in the pure form. It is usually used in dilute solution and transported in containers with vented caps to prevent increased pressure as oxygen is released. Peracetic acid is more active than hydrogen peroxide as a bactericidal and sporicidal agent. Concentrations of 250-500 ppm are effective against a broad range of bacteria in 5 minutes at pH 7.0 at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Bacterial spores are inactivated by 500-30,000 ppm peracetic acid. Only slightly increased concentrations are necessary in the presence of organic matter. Viruses require variable exposures. Enteroviruses require

2000 ppm for 15-30 minutes for inactivation.
An automated machine (Steris) that uses buffered peracetic acid liquid of 0.1-0.5\% concentration has been developed for sterilization of medical, surgical, and dental instruments. Peracetic acid sterilization systems have also been adopted for hemodialyzers. The food processing and beverage industries use peracetic acid extensively because the breakdown products in high dilution do not produce objectionable odor, taste, or toxicity. Because rinsing is not necessary in this use, time and money are saved.

Peracetic acid is a potent tumor promoter but a weak carcinogen. It is not mutagenic in the Ames test.

\section*{HEAVY METALS}

Heavy metals, principally mercury and silver, are now rarely used as disinfectants. Mercury is an environmental hazard, and some pathogenic bacteria have developed plasmid-mediated resistance to mercurials. Hypersensitivity to thimerosal is common, possibly in up to $40 \%$ of the population. These compounds are absorbed from solution by rubber and plastic closures. Nevertheless, thimerosal $0.001-0.004 \%$ is still used as a preservative of vaccines, antitoxins, and immune sera.

Inorganic silver salts are strongly bactericidal. Silver nitrate, $1: 1000$, has been most commonly used, particularly as a preventive for gonococcal ophthalmitis in newborns. Antibiotic ointments have replaced silver nitrate for this indication. Silver sulfadiazine slowly releases silver and is used to suppress bacterial growth in burn wounds (see Chapter 46).

\section*{STERI LANTS}

For many years, pressurized steam(autoclaving) at $120^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 minutes has been the basic method for sterilizing instruments and decontaminating materials. When autoclaving is not possible, as with lensed instruments and materials containing plastic and rubber, ethylene oxide - diluted with either fluorocarbon or carbon dioxide to diminish explosive hazard-was used at $440-1200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ at $45-60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with $30-60 \%$ relative humidity. The higher concentrations have been used to increase penetration.

Ethylene oxide is classified as a mutagen and carcinogen. The OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL) for ethylene oxide is 1 ppm calculated as a time-weighted average. Alternative sterilants now being used increasingly include vapor phase hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, ozone, gas plasma, chlorine dioxide, formaldehyde, and propylene oxide. Each of these sterilants has potential advantages and problems. Automated peracetic acid systems are being used increasingly for high-level decontamination and sterilization of endoscopes and hemodialyzers because of their effectiveness, automated features, and the low toxicity of the residual products of sterilization.

\section*{PRESERVATI VES}

Disinfectants are used as preservatives to prevent the overgrowth of bacteria and fungi in pharmaceutical products, laboratory sera and reagents, cosmetic products, and contact lenses. Multi-use vials of medication that may be reentered through a rubber diaphragm, and eye and nose drops, require preservatives. Preservatives should not be irritant or toxic to tissues to which they will be applied, they must be effective in preventing growth of microorganisms likely to contaminate them, and they must have sufficient solubility and stability to remain active.

Commonly used preservative agents include organic acids such as benzoic acid and salts, the parabens, (alkyl esters of p- hydroxybenzoic acid), sorbic acid and salts, phenolic compounds, quaternary ammonium
compounds, alcohols, and mercurials such as thimerosal in 0.001-0.004\% concentration.

\section*{CLI NI CAL USE OF ANTI MI CROBI AL AGENTS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

The development of antimicrobial drugs represents one of the most important advances in therapeutics, both in the control or cure of serious infections and in the prevention and treatment of infectious complications of other therapeutic modalities such as cancer chemotherapy and surgery. However, evidence is overwhelming that antimicrobial agents are vastly overprescribed in outpatient settings in the United States, and the availability of antimicrobial agents without prescription in many developing countries has-by facilitating the development of resistance-already severely limited therapeutic options in the treatment of life-threatening infections. Therefore, the clinician should first determine whether antimicrobial therapy is warranted for a given patient. The specific questions one should ask include the following:
1. Is an antimicrobial agent indicated on the basis of clinical findings? Or is it prudent to wait until such clinical findings become apparent?
2. Have appropriate clinical specimens been obtained to establish a microbiologic diagnosis?
3. What are the likely etiologic agents for the patient's illness?
4. What measures should be taken to protect individuals exposed to the index case to prevent secondary cases, and what measures should be implemented to prevent further exposure?
5. Is there clinical evidence (eg, from clinical trials) that antimicrobial therapy will confer clinical benefit for the patient?

Once a specific cause is identified based on specific microbiologic tests, the following further questions should be considered:
1. If a specific microbial pathogen is identified, can a narrower-spectrum agent be substituted for the initial empiric drug?
2. Is one agent or a combination of agents necessary?
3. What are the optimal dose, route of administration, and duration of therapy?
4. What specific tests (eg, susceptibility testing) should be undertaken to identify patients who will not respond to treatment?
5. What adjunctive measures can be undertaken to eradicate the infection? For example, is surgery feasible for removal of devitalized tissue or foreign bodies-or drainage of an abscess-into which antimicrobial agents may be unable to penetrate? Is it possible to decrease the dosage of immunosuppressive therapy in patients who have undergone organ transplantation or to give immunomodulatory drugs or antitoxins to patients with preexisting immune deficiency?

\section*{EMPI RI C ANTI MI CROBI AL THERAPY}

Antimicrobial agents are frequently used before the pathogen responsible for a particular illness or the susceptibility to a particular antimicrobial agent is known. This use of antimicrobial agents is called empiric (or presumptive) therapy and is based on experience with a particular clinical entity. The usual justification for empiric therapy is the hope that early intervention will improve the outcome; in the best cases, this has been established by placebo-controlled, double-blind prospective clinical trials. For example, treatment of
febrile episodes in neutropenic cancer patients with empiric antimicrobial therapy has been demonstrated to have impressive morbidity and mortality benefits even though the specific bacterial agent responsible for fever is determined for only a minority of such episodes. Conversely, there are many clinical situations in which empiric therapy may not be useful or may actually be harmful. For example, neutropenic patients with fever and pulmonary infiltrates may have a wide variety of causes for their clinical illness, including viruses, bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, protozoa, and noninfectious disorders. In this setting, it may be more prudent to obtain specimens by sputum culture or via bronchoalveolar lavage early to offer narrowspectrum therapy based on culture results.

Lastly, there are many clinical entities, such as certain episodes of community-acquired pneumonia, in which it is difficult to identify a specific pathogen. In such cases, a clinical response to empiric therapy may be an important clue to the likely pathogen.

\section*{Approach to Empiric Therapy}

Initiation of empiric therapy should follow a specific and systematic approach.

\section*{FORMULATE A CLI NI CAL DIAGNOSIS OF MI CROBIAL INFECTION}

Using all available data, the clinician should conclude that there is anatomic evidence of infection (eg, pneumonia, cellulitis, sinusitis).

\section*{OBTAI N SPECI MENS FOR LABORATORY EXAMI NATION}

Examination of stained specimens by microscopy or simple examination of an uncentrifuged sample of urine for white blood cells and bacteria may provide important etiologic clues in a very short time. Cultures of selected anatomic sites (blood, sputum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, stool) and nonculture methods (antigen testing, polymerase chain reaction, serology) may also confirm specific etiologic agents.

\section*{FORMULATE A MICROBIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS}

The history, physical examination, and immediately available laboratory results (eg, Gram stain of urine or sputum) may provide highly specific information. For example, in a young man with urethritis and a Gramstained smear from the urethral meatus demonstrating intracellular gram-negative diplococci, the most likely pathogen is Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In the latter instance, however, the clinician should be aware that a significant number of patients with gonococcal urethritis have uninformative Gram stains for the organism and that a significant number of patients with gonococcal urethritis harbor concurrent chlamydial infection that is not demonstrated on the Gram-stained smear.

\section*{DETERMINE THE NECESSITY FOR EMPIRIC THERAPY}

Whether or not to initate empiric therapy is an important clinical decision based partly on experience and partly on data from clinical trials. Empiric therapy is indicated when there is a significant risk of serious morbidity if therapy is withheld until a specific pathogen is detected by the clinical laboratory.

In other settings, empiric therapy may be indicated for public health reasons rather than for demonstrated superior outcome of therapy in a specific patient. For example, urethritis in a young sexually active man usually requires treatment for N gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis despite the absence of microbiologic confirmation at the time of diagnosis. Because the risk of noncompliance with follow-up visits in this patient population may lead to further transmission of these sexually transmitted pathogens, empiric therapy is warranted.

\section*{INSTITUTE TREATMENT}

Selection of empiric therapy may be based on the microbiologic diagnosis or a clinical diagnosis without available microbiologic clues. If no microbiologic information is available, the antimicrobial spectrum of the agent or agents chosen must necessarily be broader, taking into account the most likely pathogens responsible for the patient's illness.

\section*{Choice of Antimicrobial Agent}

Selection from among several drugs depends on host factors that include the following: (1) concomitant disease states (eg, AIDS, severe chronic liver disease); (2) prior adverse drug effects; (3) impaired elimination or detoxification of the drug (may be genetically predetermined but more frequently is associated with impaired renal or hepatic function due to underlying disease); (4) age of the patient; and (5) pregnancy status.

Pharmacologic factors include (1) the kinetics of absorption, distribution, and elimination; (2) the ability of the drug to be delivered to the site of infection; (3) the potential toxicity of an agent; and (4) pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions with other drugs.

Knowledge of the susceptibility of an organism to a specific agent in a hospital or community setting is important in the selection of empiric therapy. Pharmacokinetic differences among agents with similar antimicrobial spectrums may be exploited to reduce the frequency of dosing (eg, ceftriaxone may be conveniently given once every 24 hours). Finally, increasing consideration is being given to the cost of antimicrobial therapy, especially when multiple agents with comparable efficacy and toxicity are available for a specific infection.

Brief guides to empiric therapy based on presumptive microbial diagnosis and site of infection are given in Tables 51-1 and 51-2.

\section*{ANTI MI CROBI AL THERAPY OF I NFECTI ONS WITH KNOWN ETI OLOGY I NTERPRETATI ON OF CULTURE RESULTS}

Properly obtained and processed specimens for culture frequently yield reliable information about the cause of infection. The lack of a confirmatory microbiologic diagnosis may be due to the following:
(1) Sample error, eg, obtaining cultures after antimicrobial agents have been administered.
(2) Noncultivable or slow-growing organisms, (Histoplasma capsulatum, bartonella species), in which cultures are often discarded before sufficient growth has occurred for detection.
(3) Requesting bacterial cultures when infection is due to other organisms.
(4) Not recognizing the need for special media or isolation techniques (eg, charcoal yeast extract agar for isolation of legionella species, shell-vial tissue culture system for rapid isolation of CMV).

Even in the setting of a classic infectious disease for which isolation techniques have been established for decades (eg, pneumococcal pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, streptococcal pharyngitis), the sensitivity of the culture technique may be inadequate to identify all cases of the disease.

\section*{GUIDING ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY OF ESTABLI SHED INFECTI ONS Susceptibility Testing}

Testing bacterial pathogens in vitro for their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents is extremely valuable in confirming susceptibility, ideally to a narrow-spectrum nontoxic antimicrobial drug. Tests measure the concentration of drug required to inhibit growth of the organism (minimal inhibitory concentration [ $\mathbf{M I} \mathbf{C}$ ]) or to kill the organism (minimal bactericidal concentration [ $\mathbf{M B C}$ ]). The results of these tests can then be correlated with known drug concentrations in various body compartments. Only MICs are routinely measured in most infections, whereas in infections in which bactericidal therapy is required for
eradication of infection (eg, meningitis, endocarditis, sepsis in the granulocytopenic host), MBC measurements occasionally may be useful.

\section*{Specialized Assay Methods}

\section*{BETA-LACTAMASE ASSAY}

For some bacteria (eg, haemophilus species), the susceptibility patterns of strains are similar except for the production of B-lactamase. In these cases, extensive susceptibility testing may not be required and a direct test for B-lactamase using a chromogenic B-lactam substrate (nitrocephin disk) may be substituted.

\section*{SYNERGY STUDIES}

Synergy studies are in vitro tests that attempt to measure synergistic, additive, indifferent, or antagonistic drug interactions. In general, these tests have not been standardized and have not correlated well with clinical outcome. (See section on Antimicrobial Drug Combinations for details.)

\section*{MONITORI NG THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE: DURATI ON OF THERAPY}

The therapeutic response may be monitored microbiologically or clinically. Cultures of specimens taken from infected sites should eventually become sterile or demonstrate eradication of the pathogen and are useful for documenting recurrence or relapse. Follow-up cultures may also be useful for detecting superinfections or the development of resistance. Clinically, the patient's systemic manifestations of infection (malaise, fever, leukocytosis) should abate and the clinical findings should improve (eg, as shown by clearing of radiographic infiltrates or lessening hypoxemia in pneumonia).

The duration of therapy required for cure depends on the pathogen, the site of infection, and host factors (immunocompromised patients generally require longer courses of treatment). Precise data on duration of therapy exist for some infections (eg, streptococcal pharyngitis, syphilis, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis in non-AIDS patients). In many other situations, duration of therapy is determined empirically. For serious infections, continuing therapy for 7-10 days after the patient has become afebrile is a good rule of thumb. For recurrent infections (eg, sinusitis, urinary tract infections), longer courses of antimicrobial therapy are frequently necessary for eradication.

\section*{Clinical Failure of Antimicrobial Therapy}

When the patient has an inadequate clinical or microbiologic response to antimicrobial therapy selected by in vitro susceptibility testing, systematic investigation should be undertaken to determine the cause of failure. Errors in susceptibility testing are rare, but the original results should be confirmed by repeat testing. Drug dosing and absorption should be scrutinized and tested directly using serum measurements, pill counting, or directly observed therapy.

The clinical data should be reviewed to determine whether the patient's immune function is adequate and, if not, what can be done to maximize it. For example, are adequate numbers of granulocytes present and are HIV infection, malnutrition, or underlying malignancy present? The presence of abscesses or foreign bodies should also be considered. Lastly, culture and susceptibility testing should be repeated to determine whether superinfection has occurred with another organism or whether the original pathogen has developed drug resistance.

\section*{ANTI MI CROBI AL PHARMACODYNAMI CS}

The time course of drug concentration is closely related to the antimicrobial effect at the site of infection
and to any toxic effects. Pharmacodynamic factors include pathogen susceptibility testing, drug bactericidal versus bacteriostatic activity, and drug synergism, antagonism, and postantibiotic effects. Together with pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic information permits the selection of optimal antimicrobial dosage regimens.

\section*{Bacteriostatic versus Bactericidal Activity}

Antibacterial agents may be classified as bacteriostatic or bactericidal (Table 51-3). For agents that are primarily bacteriostatic, inhibitory drug concentrations are much lower than bactericidal drug concentrations. In general, cell wall-active agents are bactericidal, and drugs that inhibit protein synthesis are bacteriostatic.
Table 51-3. Bactericidal and Bacteriostatic Antibacterial Agents.

\section*{Vancomycin}

The classification of antibacterial agents as bactericidal or bacteriostatic has limitations. Some agents that are considered to be bacteriostatic may be bactericidal against selected organisms. On the other hand, enterococci are inhibited but not killed by vancomycin, penicillin, or ampicillin used as single agents.

Bacteriostatic and bactericidal agents are equivalent for the treatment of most infectious diseases in immunocompetent hosts. Bactericidal agents should be selected over bacteriostatic ones in circumstances in which local or systemic host defenses are impaired. Bactericidal agents are required for treatment of endocarditis and other endovascular infections, meningitis, and infections in neutropenic cancer patients.

Bactericidal agents can be divided into two groups: agents that exhibit concentration-dependent killing (eg, aminoglycosides and quinolones) and agents that exhibit time-dependent killing (eg, B-lactams and vancomycin). For drugs whose killing action is concentration-dependent, the rate and extent of killing increase with increasing drug concentrations. Concentration-dependent killing is one of the pharmacodynamic factors responsible for the efficacy of once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides.

For drugs whose killing action is time-dependent, bactericidal activity continues as long as serum concentrations are greater than the MBC. Drug concentrations of time-dependent killing agents that lack a postantibiotic effect should be maintained above the MIC for the entire interval between doses.

\section*{Postantibiotic Effect}

Persistent suppression of bacterial growth after limited exposure to an antimicrobial agent is known as the postantibiotic effect (PAE). The PAE can be expressed mathematically as follows:
PAE = T - C
where $T$ is the time required for the viable count in the test (in vitro) culture to increase tenfold above the count observed immediately before drug removal and C is the time required for the count in an untreated culture to increase tenfold above the count observed immediately after completion of the same procedure used on the test culture. The PAE reflects the time required for bacteria to return to logarithmic growth.

Proposed mechanisms include (1) slow recovery after reversible nonlethal damage to cell structures; (2) persistence of the drug at a binding site or within the periplasmic space; and (3) the need to synthesize new enzymes before growth can resume. Most antimicrobials possess significant in vitro PAEs ( $\equiv 1.5$ hours) against susceptible gram-positive cocci (Table 51-4). Antimicrobials with significant PAEs against susceptible gram-negative bacilli are limited to carbapenems and agents that inhibit protein or DNA synthesis.
Table 51-4. Antibacterial Agents with In Vitro Postantibiotic Effects $\geq 1.5$ Hours.

In vivo PAEs are usually much longer than in vitro PAEs. This is thought to be due to postantibiotic leukocyte enhancement (PALE) and exposure of bacteria to subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations. The efficacy of once-daily dosing regimens is in part due to the PAE. Aminoglycosides and quinolones possess concentration-dependent PAEs; thus, high doses of aminoglycosides given once daily result in enhanced bactericidal activity and extended PAEs. This combination of pharmacodynamic effects allows aminoglycoside serum concentrations that are below the MICs of target organisms to remain effective for extended periods of time.

\section*{PHARMACOKI NETI C CONSI DERATI ONS}

\section*{Route of Administration}

Many antimicrobial agents have similar pharmacokinetic properties when given orally or parenterally (ie, tetracyclines, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, clindamycin, rifampin, linezolid and fluconazole). In most cases, oral therapy with these drugs is equally effective, is less costly, and results in fewer complications than parenteral therapy.

The intravenous route is preferred in the following situations: (1) for critically ill patients; (2) for patients with bacterial meningitis or endocarditis; (3) for patients with nausea, vomiting, gastrectomy, or diseases that may impair oral absorption; and (4) when giving antimicrobials that are poorly absorbed following oral administration.

\section*{Conditions that Alter Antimicrobial Pharmacokinetics}

Various diseases and physiologic states alter the pharmacokinetics of antimicrobial agents. Impairment of renal or hepatic function may result in decreased elimination. Table 51-5 lists drugs that require dosage reduction in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency. Failure to reduce antimicrobial agent dosage in such patients may cause toxic side effects. Conversely, patients with burns, cystic fibrosis, or trauma may have increased dosage requirements for selected agents. The pharmacokinetics of antimicrobials are also altered in the elderly, in neonates, and in pregnancy.

\section*{Drug Concentrations in Body Fluids}

Most antimicrobial agents are well distributed to most body tissues and fluids. Penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid is an exception. Most do not penetrate uninflamed meninges to an appreciable extent. In the presence of meningitis, however, the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of many antimicrobials increase (Table 51-6).

\section*{Monitoring Serum Concentrations of Antimicrobial Agents}

For most antimicrobial agents, the relationship between dose and therapeutic outcome is well established, and serum concentration monitoring is unnecessary for these drugs. To justify routine serum concentration
monitoring, it should be established (1) that a direct relationship exists between drug concentrations and efficacy or toxicity; (2) that substantial interpatient variability exists in serum concentrations on standard doses; (3) that a small difference exists between therapeutic and toxic serum concentrations; (4) that the clinical efficacy or toxicity of the drug is delayed or difficult to measure; and (5) that an accurate assay is available.

In clinical practice, serum concentration monitoring is routinely performed on patients receiving aminoglycosides. Despite the lack of supporting evidence for its usefulness or need, serum vancomycin concentration monitoring is also widespread. Flucytosine serum concentration monitoring has been shown to reduce toxicity when doses are adjusted to maintain peak concentrations below $100 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$.

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF ANTI MI CROBI AL DRUG TOXI CITY}

Owing to the large number of antimicrobials available, it is usually possible to select an effective alternative in patients who develop serious drug toxicity (Table 51-1). However, for some infections there are no effective alternatives to the drug of choice. For example, in patients with neurosyphilis who have a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin, it is necessary to perform skin testing and desensitization to penicillin. It is important to obtain a clear history of drug allergy and other adverse drug reactions. A patient with a documented antimicrobial allergy should carry a card with the name of the drug and a description of the reaction. Cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins is less than $10 \%$. Cephalosporins may be administered to patients with penicillin-induced maculopapular rashes but should be avoided in patients with a history of penicillin-induced immediate hypersensitivity reactions. The cross-reactivity between penicillins and carbapenems may exceed $50 \%$. On the other hand, aztreonam does not cross-react with penicillins and can be safely administered to patients with a history of penicillin-induced anaphylaxis. For mild reactions, it may be possible to continue therapy with use of adjunctive agents or dosage reduction.

Adverse reactions to antimicrobials occur with increased frequency in several groups, including neonates, geriatric patients, renal failure patients, and AIDS patients. Dosage adjustment of the drugs listed in Table 51-5 is essential for the prevention of adverse effects in patients with renal failure. In addition, several agents are contraindicated in patients with renal impairment because of increased rates of serious toxicity (Table 51-5). See the preceding chapters for discussions of specific drugs.

Polypharmacy also predisposes to drug interactions. Although the mechanism is not known, AIDS patients have an unusually high incidence of toxicity to a number of drugs, including clindamycin, aminopenicillins, and sulfonamides. Many of these reactions, including rash and fever, may respond to dosage reduction or treatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines. Other examples are discussed in the preceding chapters and in Appendix II.

\section*{ANTI MI CROBI AL DRUG COMBI NATI ONS RATI ONALE FOR COMBI NATI ON ANTI MI CROBI AL THERAPY}

Most infections should be treated with a single antimicrobial agent. Although indications for combination therapy exist, antimicrobial combinations are often overused in clinical practice. The unnecessary use of antimicrobial combinations increases toxicity and costs and may occasionally result in reduced efficacy due to antagonism of one drug by another. Antimicrobial combinations should be selected for one or more of the following reasons:
(1) To provide broad-spectrum empiric therapy in seriously ill patients.
(2) To treat polymicrobial infections such as intra-abdominal abscesses. The antimicrobial combination chosen should cover the most common known or suspected pathogens but need not cover all possible pathogens. The availability of antimicrobials with excellent polymicrobial coverage (eg, B-lactamase inhibitor combinations or carbapenems) may reduce the need for combination therapy in the setting of polymicrobial infections.
(3) To decrease the emergence of resistant strains. The value of combination therapy in this setting has been clearly demonstrated for tuberculosis.
(4) To decrease dose-related toxicity by using reduced doses of one or more components of the drug regimen. The use of flucytosine in combination with amphotericin B for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in non-HIV-infected patients allows for a reduction in amphotericin B dosage with decreased amphotericin B-induced nephrotoxicity.
(5) To obtain enhanced inhibition or killing. This use of antimicrobial combinations is discussed in the paragraphs that follow.

\section*{SYNERGI SM \& ANTAGONISM}

When the inhibitory or killing effects of two or more antimicrobials used together are significantly greater than expected from their effects when used individually, synergism is said to result. Synergism is marked by a fourfold or greater reduction in the MIC or MBC of each drug when used in combination versus when used alone.

The interaction between two antimicrobial agents can be expressed by the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index:
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{FIC}_{\text {index }} & =\mathrm{FIC}_{\mathrm{A}}+\mathrm{FIC}_{\mathrm{B}} \\
\mathrm{FIC}_{\mathrm{A}} & =\frac{\mathrm{MIC} \text { of drug } \mathrm{A} \text { in combination }}{\mathrm{MIC} \text { of drug } \mathrm{A} \text { alone }} \\
\mathrm{FIC}_{\mathrm{B}} & =\frac{\mathrm{MIC} \text { of drug } \mathrm{B} \text { in combination }}{\mathrm{MIC} \text { of drug } \mathrm{B} \text { alone }}
\end{aligned}$$

The fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) index can be determined by substituting MBCs for MICs in the above equations. Synergism for combinations of two drugs requires an FIC or FBC index of 0.5 or less. Antagonism occurs when the combined inhibitory or killing effects of two or more antimicrobials are significantly less than expected when the drugs are used individually. Antibiotic antagonism is marked by an FIC or FBC index of 4 or more.

\section*{Mechanisms of Synergistic Action}

The need for synergistic combinations of antimicrobials has been clearly established for the treatment of enterococcal endocarditis. Bactericidal activity is essential for the optimal management of bacterial
endocarditis. Penicillin or ampicillin in combination with gentamicin or streptomycin is superior to monotherapy with a penicillin or vancomycin. When tested alone, penicillins and vancomycin are only bacteriostatic against susceptible enterococcal isolates. When these agents are combined with an aminoglycoside, however, bactericidal activity results. The addition of gentamicin or streptomycin to penicillin allows for a reduction in the duration of therapy for selected patients with viridans streptococcal endocarditis. There is some evidence that synergistic combinations of antimicrobials may be of benefit in the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections in febrile neutropenic cancer patients and in systemic infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Other synergistic antimicrobial combinations have been shown to be more effective than monotherapy with individual components. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been successfully used for the treatment of bacterial infections and Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia.* Beta-lactamase inhibitors restore the activity of intrinsically active but hydrolyzable B-lactams against organisms such as S aureus and Bacteroides fragilis. Three major mechanisms of antimicrobial synergism have been established:
1. Blockade of sequential steps in a metabolic sequence: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the best-known example of this mechanism of synergy (see Chapter 46). Blockade of the two sequential steps in the folic acid pathway by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole results in a much more complete inhibition of growth than achieved by either component alone.
2. Inhibition of enzymatic inactivation: Enzymatic inactivation of B-lactam antibiotics is a major mechanism of antibiotic resistance. Inhibition of B-lactamase by B-lactamase inhibitor drugs (eg, sulbactam) results in synergism.
3. Enhancement of antimicrobial agent uptake: Penicillins and other cell wall-active agents can increase the uptake of aminoglycosides by a number of bacteria, including staphylococci, enterococci, streptococci, and P aeruginosa. Enterococci are thought to be intrinsically resistant to aminoglycosides because of permeability barriers. Similarly, amphotericin $B$ is thought to enhance the uptake of flucytosine by fungi.
*Pneumocystis jiroveci is a fungal organism found in humans (P carinii infects animals) that responds to antiprotozoal drugs. See Chapter 53.

\section*{Mechanisms of Antagonistic Action}

There are few clinically relevant examples of antimicrobial antagonism. The most striking example was reported in a study of patients with pneumococcal meningitis. Patients who were treated with the combination of penicillin and chlortetracycline had a mortality rate of $79 \%$ compared with a mortality rate of $21 \%$ in patients who received penicillin monotherapy (illustrating the first mechanism set forth below).

The use of an antagonistic antimicrobial combination does not preclude other potential beneficial interactions. For example, rifampin may antagonize the action of antistaphylococcal penicillins or vancomycin against staphylococci. However, the aforementioned antimicrobials may prevent the emergence of resistance to rifampin.

Two major mechanisms of antimicrobial antagonism have been established:
1. Inhibition of cidal activity by static agents: Bacteriostatic agents such as tetracyclines and chloramphenicol can antagonize the action of bactericidal cell wall-active agents because cell wallactive agents require that the bacteria be actively growing and dividing.
> 2. Induction of enzymatic inactivation: Some gram-negative bacilli, including enterobacter species, P aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Citrobacter freundii, possess inducible Blactamases. Beta-lactam antibiotics such as imipenem, cefoxitin, and ampicillin are potent inducers of B-lactamase production. If an inducing agent is combined with an intrinsically active but hydrolyzable $B$-lactam such as piperacillin, antagonism may result.

\section*{ANTI MI CROBI AL PROPHYLAXI S}

Antimicrobial agents are effective in preventing infections in many settings. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be used in circumstances in which efficacy has been demonstrated and benefits outweigh the risks of prophylaxis. Antimicrobial prophylaxis may be divided into surgical prophylaxis and nonsurgical prophylaxis.

\section*{Surgical Prophylaxis}

Surgical wound infections are a major category of nosocomial infections. The estimated annual cost of surgical wound infections in the United States is $\$ 1.5$ billion.

The National Research Council (NRC) Wound Classification Criteria have served as the basis for recommending antimicrobial prophylaxis. The NRC criteria consist of four classes (see National Research Council (NRC) Wound Classification Criteria).

The Study of the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC) identified four independent risk factors for postoperative wound infections: operations on the abdomen, operations lasting more than 2 hours, contaminated or dirty wound classification, and at least three medical diagnoses. Patients with at least two SENIC risk factors who undergo clean surgical procedures are at increased risk of developing surgical wound infections and should receive antimicrobial prophylaxis.

Surgical procedures that necessitate the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis include contaminated and cleancontaminated operations, selected operations in which postoperative infection may be catastrophic such as open heart surgery, clean procedures that involve placement of prosthetic materials, and any procedure in an immunocompromised host. The operation should carry a significant risk of postoperative site infection or cause significant bacterial contamination.

General principles of antimicrobial surgical prophylaxis include the following:
(1) The antibiotic should be active against common surgical wound pathogens; unnecessarily broad coverage should be avoided.
(2) The antibiotic should have proved efficacy in clinical trials.
(3) The antibiotic must achieve concentrations greater than the MIC of suspected pathogens, and these concentrations must be present at the time of incision.
(4) The shortest possible course-ideally a single dose-of the most effective and least toxic antibiotic should be used.
(5) The newer broad-spectrum antibiotics should be reserved for therapy of resistant infections.
(6) If all other factors are equal, the least expensive agent should be used.

The proper selection and administration of antimicrobial prophylaxis is of utmost importance. Common indications for surgical prophylaxis are shown in Table 51-7. Cefazolin is the prophylactic agent of choice for head and neck, gastroduodenal, biliary tract, gynecologic, and clean procedures. Local wound infection patterns should be considered when selecting antimicrobial prophylaxis. The selection of vancomycin over cefazolin may be necessary in hospitals with high rates of methicillin-resistant $S$ aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis infections. The antibiotic should be present in adequate concentrations at the operative site before incision and throughout the procedure; initial dosing is dependent on the volume of distribution, peak levels, clearance, protein binding, and bioavailability. Parenteral agents should be administered during the interval beginning 60 minutes before incision; administration up to the time of incision is preferred. In cesarean section, the antibiotic is administered after umbilical cord clamping. If short-acting agents such as cefoxitin are used, doses should be repeated if the procedure exceeds $3-4$ hours in duration. Single-dose prophylaxis is effective for most procedures and results in decreased toxicity and antimicrobial resistance.

Improper administration of antimicrobial prophylaxis leads to excessive surgical wound infection rates.

Common errors in antibiotic prophylaxis include selection of the wrong antibiotic, administering the first dose too early or too late, failure to repeat doses during prolonged procedures, excessive duration of prophylaxis, and inappropriate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

\section*{NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (NRC) WOUND CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA}

Clean: Elective, primarily closed procedure; respiratory, gastrointestinal, biliary, genitourinary, or oropharyngeal tract not entered; no acute inflammation and no break in technique; expected infection rate $\leq 2 \%$.

Clean contaminated: Urgent or emergency case that is otherwise clean; elective, controlled opening of respiratory, gastrointestinal, biliary, or oropharyngeal tract; minimal spillage or minor break in technique; expected infection rate $\leqq 10 \%$.

Contaminated: Acute nonpurulent inflammation; major technique break or major spill from hollow organ; penetrating trauma less than 4 hours old; chronic open wounds to be grafted or covered; expected infection rate about 20\%.

Dirty: Purulence or abscess; preoperative perforation of respiratory, gastrointestinal, biliary, or oropharyngeal tract; penetrating trauma more than 4 hours old; expected infection rate about $40 \%$.

\section*{Nonsurgical Prophylaxis}

Nonsurgical prophylaxis includes the administration of antimicrobials to prevent colonization or asymptomatic infection as well as the administration of drugs following colonization by or inoculation of pathogens but before the development of disease. Nonsurgical prophylaxis is indicated in individuals who are at high risk for temporary exposure to selected virulent pathogens and in patients who are at increased risk for developing infection because of underlying disease (eg, immunocompromised hosts). Prophylaxis is most effective when directed against organisms that are predictably susceptible to antimicrobial agents. Common indications for nonsurgical prophylaxis are listed in Table 51-8.

\section*{I NTRODUCTI ON TO ANTI PARASI TI C CHEMOTHERAPY: I NTRODUCTI ON}

In its general scientific sense, the term "parasite" includes all of the known infectious agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and helminths. In this and the two following chapters, the term is used in a restricted sense to denote the protozoa and helminths. It has been estimated that 3 billion ( $3 \times 10^{9}$ ) humans suffer from parasitic infections, plus a much greater number of domestic and wild animals. Although these diseases constitute the most widespread human health problem in the world today, they have for various reasons also been the most neglected.

In theory, the parasitic infections should be relatively easy to treat because the etiologic agents are known in almost all cases. Furthermore, recent advances in cell culture techniques have made possible in vitro cultivation of many of the important parasites. These advances have not only laid to rest the traditional view that parasites somehow depend on a living host for their existence but have also enabled us to study parasites by methods similar to those employed in investigations of bacteria, including biochemistry, molecular biology, and immunologic pharmacology. However, many problems remain to be solved before more effective chemotherapeutic agents will be discovered and made available for all of the parasitic diseases.

\section*{TARGETS OF CHEMOTHERAPY}

A rational approach to antiparasitic chemotherapy requires comparative biochemical and physiologic investigations of host and parasite to discover differences in essential processes that will permit selective inhibition in the parasite and not in the host. One might expect that the parasite would have many deficiencies in its metabolism associated with its parasitic nature. This is true of many parasites-the oversimplified metabolic pathways are usually indispensable for survival of the parasite and thus represent potential points of vulnerability. However, oversimplified metabolic pathways are not the only opportunity for attack. Although the parasite lives in a metabolically luxurious environment and may become "lazy," the environment is not entirely friendly and the parasite must have defense mechanisms in order to survive-ie, to defend itself against immunologic attack, proteolytic digestion, etc, by the host. In some instances, necessary nutrients are not supplied to the parasite from the host, although the latter can obtain the same nutrients from the diet. In this situation, the parasite will have acquired the synthetic activity needed for its survival. Finally, the great evolutionary distance between host and parasite has in some cases resulted in sufficient differences among individual enzymes or functional pathways to allow selective inhibition of the parasite. Thus, there can be three major types of targets for chemotherapy of parasitic diseases: (1) unique essential enzymes found only in the parasite; (2) similar enzymes found in both host and parasite but indispensable only for the parasite; and (3) common biochemical functions found in both parasite and host but with different pharmacologic properties. Examples of specific targets and drugs that act on them are summarized in Table 52-1.

\section*{ESSENTIAL ENZYMES FOUND ONLY IN PARASITES}

These enzymes would appear to be the cleanest targets for chemotherapy. Like enzymes involved in the synthesis of bacterial cell walls (see Chapter 43), inhibition of these enzymes should have no effect on the host. Unfortunately, only a few of these enzymes have been discovered among the parasitic protozoa. Furthermore, their usefulness as chemotherapeutic targets is sometimes limited because of the development of drug resistance.

\section*{ENZYMES INDISPENSABLE ONLY IN PARASITES}

Because of the many metabolic deficiencies among parasites, there are enzymes whose functions may be essential for the survival of the parasites, but are not indispensable to the host. That is, the host may be able to survive the complete loss of these enzyme functions by achieving the same result through alternative pathways. This discrepancy opens up opportunities for antiparasitic chemotherapy, although insufficiently selective inhibition of parasite enzymes remains an important safety concern.

\section*{I NDISPENSABLE BIOCHEMI CAL FUNCTI ONS FOUND IN BOTH PARASITE \& HOST BUT WITH DIFFERENT PHARMACOLOGIC PROPERTIES}

In the parasite, these functions have differentiated sufficiently to become probable targets for antiparasitic chemotherapy, not because of the parasitic nature of the organism or its unique environment but, more likely, because of the long evolutionary distances separating the parasite and the host. It is thus difficult to discover these targets through studying metabolic deficiency or special nutritional requirements of the parasite. They have usually been found by investigating the modes of action of some well-established antiparasitic agents discovered by screening methods in the past. More recently, comparison of genome databases between the host and the parasite has become practical. The target may not be a single well-defined enzyme but may include transporters, receptors, cellular structural components, or other specific functions essential for survival of the parasite.

\section*{DRUGS WHOSE MECHANISMS HAVE NOT YET BEEN CONCLUSIVELY I DENTI FI ED}

In spite of considerable progress in defining the mechanisms of action of the drugs listed in Table 52-1, there are still wide gaps in our understanding of several other important antiparasitic agents. These include chloroquine and similar antimalarials, diethylcarbamazine, diloxanide, praziquantel, and others. From the biochemical activities that have been identified for them, it appears that many are capable of binding DNA, some can uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, and some inhibit protein synthesis. These types of activity, which are toxic to the host but could also be involved in the antiparasitic action, may have been preferentially detectable in random screenings routinely used for antiparasitic agents in the past.

\section*{TREATMENT OF MALARIA}

Four species of plasmodium cause human malaria: Plasmodium falciparum, P vivax, P malariae, and P ovale. Although all may cause significant illness, P falciparum is responsible for nearly all serious complications and deaths. Drug resistance is an important therapeutic problem, most notably with P falciparum.

\section*{PARASITE LI FE CYCLE}

An anopheline mosquito inoculates plasmodium sporozoites to initiate human infection. Circulating sporozoites rapidly invade liver cells, and exoerythrocytic stage tissue schizonts mature in the liver. Merozoites are subsequently released from the liver and invade erythrocytes. Only erythrocytic parasites cause clinical illness. Repeated cycles of infection can lead to the infection of many erythrocytes and serious disease. Sexual stage gametocytes also develop in erythrocytes before being taken up by mosquitoes, where they develop into infective sporozoites.

In P falciparum and P malariae infection, only one cycle of liver cell invasion and multiplication occurs, and liver infection ceases spontaneously in less than 4 weeks. Thus, treatment that eliminates erythrocytic parasites will cure these infections. In P vivax and P ovale infections, a dormant hepatic stage, the hypnozoite, is not eradicated by most drugs, and subsequent relapses can therefore occur after therapy directed against erythrocytic parasites. Eradication of both erythrocytic and hepatic parasites is required to cure these infections.

\section*{DRUG CLASSI FI CATI ON}

Several classes of antimalarial drugs are available (Table 53-1; Figure 53-1). Drugs that eliminate developing or dormant liver forms are called tissue schizonticides; those that act on erythrocytic parasites are blood schizonticides; and those that kill sexual stages and prevent transmission to mosquitoes are gametocides. No one available agent can reliably effect a radical cure, ie, eliminate both hepatic and erythrocytic stages. Few available agents are causal prophylactic drugs, ie, capable of preventing erythrocytic infection. However, all effective chemoprophylactic agents kill erythrocytic parasites before they increase sufficiently in number to cause clinical disease.

\section*{CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS \& TREATMENT}

When patients are counseled on the prevention of malaria, it is imperative to emphasize measures to prevent mosquito bites (insect repellents, insecticides, and bed nets), because parasites are increasingly resistant to multiple drugs and no chemoprophylactic regimen is fully protective. Current recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) include the use of chloroquine for chemoprophylaxis in the few areas infested by only chloroquine-sensitive malaria parasites (principally the Caribbean and Central America west of the Panama Canal), mefloquine or Malarone for most other malarious areas, and doxycycline for areas with a very high prevalence of multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria (principally border areas of Thailand) (Table 53-2). CDC recommendations should be checked regularly (Phone: 877-FYI-TRIP; Internet: www.cdc.gov/travel/), as these may change in response to changing resistance patterns and increasing experience with new drugs. In some circumstances, it may be appropriate for travelers to carry supplies of drugs with them in case they develop a febrile illness when medical attention is unavailable. Regimens for selftreatment should generally include either quinine or artemisinin derivatives. The latter, although not available in the USA, are widely available in other countries. Most authorities do not recommend routine terminal chemoprophylaxis with primaquine to eradicate dormant hepatic stages of P vivax and P ovale after travel, but this may be appropriate in some circumstances, especially for travelers with major exposure to these parasites.

Table 53-2. Drugs for the Prevention of Malaria in Travelers. ${ }^{1}$
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Drug & Use ${ }^{2}$ & Adult Dosage ${ }^{3}$ \\
\hline Chloroquine & Areas without resistant P falciparum & 500 mg weekly \\
\hline Malarone & Areas with multidrug-resistant P falciparum & 1 tablet ( 250 mg atovaquone/ 100 mg proguanil) daily \\
\hline Mefloquine & Areas with chloroquine-resistant P falciparum & 250 mg weekly \\
\hline Doxycycline & Areas with multidrug-resistant P falciparum & 100 mg daily \\
\hline Primaquine ${ }^{4}$ & Terminal prophylaxis of P vivax and P ovale infections & 26.3 mg ( 15 mg base) daily for 14 days after travel \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
${ }^{1}$ Recommendations may change, as resistance to all available drugs is increasing. See text for additional information on toxicities and cautions. For additional details and pediatric dosing, see CDC guidelines (phone: 877-FYI-TRIP; http://www.cdc.gov). Travelers to remote areas should consider carrying effective therapy (see text) for use if they develop a febrile illness and cannot reach medical attention quickly.
${ }^{2}$ Areas without known chloroquine-resistant $P$ falciparum are Central America west of the Panama Canal, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Egypt, and most malarious countries of the Middle East. Malarone or mefloquine are currently recommended for other malarious areas except for border areas of Thailand, where doxycycline is recommended.
${ }^{3}$ For drugs other than primaquine, begin 1-2 weeks before departure (except 2 days before for doxycycline and Malarone) and continue for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area (except 1 week for Malarone). All dosages refer to salts.
${ }^{4}$ Screen for G6PD deficiency before using primaquine.
Treatment of malaria that presents in the USA is straightforward (Table 53-3). Nonfalciparum infections and falciparum malaria from areas without known resistance should be treated with chloroquine. Vivax and ovale malaria should subsequently be treated with primaquine to eradicate liver forms. However, for P vivax, chloroquine-resistance is increasingly reported and primaquine may fail to eradicate liver stages. Falciparum malaria from most areas is best treated with oral quinine or intravenous quinidine, in either case plus doxycycline or, for children, clindamycin. Other agents that are generally effective against resistant falciparum malaria include mefloquine and halofantrine, both of which have toxicity concerns at treatment dosages, and the artemisinin derivatives artesunate and artemether (alone or in combination, as discussed below).

\section*{CHLOROQUINE}

Chloroquine has been the drug of choice for both treatment and chemoprophylaxis of malaria since the 1940s, but its utility against $P$ falciparum has been seriously compromised by drug resistance. It remains the drug of choice in the treatment of sensitive $P$ falciparum and other species of human malaria parasites.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Chloroquine is a synthetic 4-aminoquinoline (Figure 53-1) formulated as the phosphate salt for oral use. It is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, reaches maximum plasma concentrations in about 3 hours, and is rapidly distributed to the tissues. It has a very large apparent volume of distribution of 100-1000 L/kg and is slowly released from tissues and metabolized. Chloroquine is principally excreted in the urine with an initial half-life of 3-5 days but a much longer terminal elimination half-life of 1-2 months.

\section*{Antimalarial Action \& Resistance}

\section*{ANTI MALARIAL ACTION}

When not limited by resistance, chloroquine is a highly effective blood schizonticide. It is also moderately effective against gametocytes of P vivax, P ovale, and P malariae but not against those of P falciparum. Chloroquine is not active against liver stage parasites.

\section*{MECHANISM OF ACTION}

The mechanism of action remains controversial. Chloroquine probably acts by concentrating in parasite food vacuoles, preventing the polymerization of the hemoglobin breakdown product, heme, into hemozoin, and thus eliciting parasite toxicity due to the buildup of free heme.

\section*{RESISTANCE}

Resistance to chloroquine is now very common among strains of P falciparum and uncommon but increasing for P vivax. In P falciparum, mutations in a putative transporter, PfCRT, have been correlated with resistance. Chloroquine resistance can be reversed by certain agents, including verapamil, desipramine, and chlorpheniramine, but the clinical value of resistance-reversing drugs is not established.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{TREATMENT}

Chloroquine is the drug of choice in the treatment of nonfalciparum and sensitive falciparum malaria. It rapidly terminates fever (in 24-48 hours) and clears parasitemia (in 48-72 hours) caused by sensitive parasites. It is also still used to treat falciparum malaria in many areas with widespread resistance, in particular much of Africa, owing to its safety and low cost and the fact that many partially immune individuals respond to treatment even when infecting parasites are partially resistant to chloroquine. However, other agents are preferred to treat potentially resistant falciparum malaria, especially in nonimmune individuals, and chloroquine is being replaced by other drugs as the standard therapy to treat falciparum malaria in most endemic countries. Chloroquine does not eliminate dormant liver forms of P vivax and P ovale, and for that reason primaquine must be added for the radical cure of these species.

\section*{CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS}

Chloroquine is the preferred chemoprophylactic agent in malarious regions without resistant falciparum malaria. Eradication of P vivax and P ovale requires a course of primaquine to clear hepatic stages.

\section*{AMEBIC LIVER ABSCESS}

Chloroquine reaches high liver concentrations and may be used for amebic abscesses that fail initial therapy with metronidazole (see below).

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Chloroquine is usually very well tolerated, even with prolonged use. Pruritus is common, primarily in Africans. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, anorexia, malaise, blurring of vision, and urticaria are uncommon. Dosing after meals may reduce some adverse effects. Rare reactions include hemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient persons, impaired hearing, confusion, psychosis, seizures, agranulocytosis, exfoliative dermatitis, alopecia, bleaching of hair, hypotension, and electrocardiographic changes (QRS widening, T wave abnormalities). The long-term administration of high doses of chloroquine for rheumatologic diseases (see Chapter 36) can result in irreversible ototoxicity, retinopathy, myopathy, and peripheral neuropathy. These abnormalities are rarely if ever seen with standard-dose weekly chemoprophylaxis, even when given for prolonged periods. Large intramuscular injections or rapid intravenous infusions of chloroquine hydrochloride can result in severe hypotension and respiratory and cardiac arrest. Parenteral administration of chloroquine is best avoided, but if other drugs are not available for parenteral use, it should be infused slowly.

\section*{Contraindications \& Cautions}

Chloroquine is contraindicated in patients with psoriasis or porphyria, in whom it may precipitate acute attacks of these diseases. It should generally not be used in those with retinal or visual field abnormalities or myopathy. Chloroquine should be used with caution in patients with a history of liver disease or neurologic or hematologic disorders. The antidiarrheal agent kaolin and calcium- and magnesium-containing antacids interfere with the absorption of chloroquine and should not be coadministered with the drug. Chloroquine is considered safe in pregnancy and for young children.

\section*{AMODI AQUI NE}

Amodiaquine is closely related to chloroquine, and it probably shares mechanisms of action and resistance with that drug. Amodiaquine has been widely used to treat malaria because of its low cost, limited toxicity, and, in some areas, effectiveness against chloroquine-resistant strains of P falciparum. Important toxicities of amodiaquine, including agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and hepatotoxicity, have limited use of the drug in recent years. However, recent reevaluation has shown that serious toxicity from amodiaquine is rare, and some authorities now advocate its use as a replacement for chloroquine (especially in combination regimens) in areas with high rates of resistance but limited resources. The World Health Organization lists amodiaquine plus artesunate as a recommended therapy for falciparum malaria in areas with resistance to older drugs and amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine as an interim alternative if artemisinin-containing therapies are unavailable. Chemoprophylaxis with amodiaquine is best avoided because of its apparent increased toxicity with long-term use.

\section*{QUININE \& QUINIDINE}

Quinine and quinidine remain first-line therapies for falciparum malaria-especially severe disease-although toxicity may complicate therapy. Resistance to quinine is uncommon but increasing.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Quinine is derived from the bark of the cinchona tree, a traditional remedy for intermittent fevers from South America. The alkaloid quinine was purified from the bark in 1820, and it has been used in the treatment and prevention of malaria since that time. Quinidine, the dextrorotatory stereoisomer of quinine, is at least as effective as parenteral quinine in the treatment of severe falciparum malaria. After oral administration, quinine is rapidly absorbed, reaches peak plasma levels in 1-3 hours, and is widely distributed in body tissues. The use of a loading dose in severe malaria allows the achievement of peak levels within a few hours. The pharmacokinetics of quinine varies among populations.
Individuals with malaria develop higher plasma levels of the drug than healthy controls, but toxicity is not increased, apparently because of increased protein binding. The half-life of quinine also is longer in those with severe malaria (18 hours) than in healthy controls (11 hours). Quinidine has a shorter halflife than quinine, mostly as a result of decreased protein binding. Quinine is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine.

\section*{Antimalarial Action \& Resistance}

\section*{ANTI MALARIAL ACTION}

Quinine is a rapidly acting, highly effective blood schizonticide against the four species of human malaria parasites. The drug is gametocidal against $P$ vivax and $P$ ovale but not $P$ falciparum. It is not active against liver stage parasites. The mechanism of action of quinine is unknown.

\section*{RESISTANCE}

Increasing in vitro resistance of parasites from a number of areas suggests that quinine resistance will be an increasing problem. Resistance to quinine is already common in some areas of Southeast Asia, especially border areas of Thailand, where the drug may fail if used alone to treat falciparum malaria. However, quinine still provides at least a partial therapeutic effect in most patients.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{PARENTERAL TREATMENT OF SEVERE FALCI PARUM MALARIA}

Quinine dihydrochloride or quinidine gluconate is the treatment of choice for severe falciparum malaria. Quinine can be administered slowly intravenously or, in a dilute solution, intramuscularly, but parenteral preparations of this drug are not available in the USA. Quinidine is now the standard therapy in the USA for the parenteral treatment of severe falciparum malaria. The drug can be administered in divided doses or by continuous intravenous infusion; treatment should begin with a loading dose to rapidly achieve effective plasma concentrations. Because of its cardiac toxicity and the relative unpredictability of its pharmacokinetics, intravenous quinidine should be administered with cardiac monitoring. Therapy should be changed to oral quinine as soon as the patient has improved and can tolerate oral medications.

\section*{ORAL TREATMENT OF FALCI PARUM MALARI A}

Quinine sulfate is appropriate first-line therapy for uncomplicated falciparum malaria except when the infection was transmitted in an area without documented chloroquine-resistant malaria. Quinine is commonly used with a second drug (most often doxycycline or, in children, clindamycin) to shorten quinine's duration of use (usually to 3 days) and limit toxicity. Quinine is less effective than chloroquine
against other human malarias and is more toxic, and it is therefore not used to treat infections with these parasites.

\section*{MALARIAL CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS}

Quinine is not generally used in chemoprophylaxis owing to its toxicity, although a daily dose of 325 mg is effective.

\section*{BABESIOSIS}

Quinine is first-line therapy, in combination with clindamycin, in the treatment of infection with Babesia microti or other human babesial infections.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Therapeutic dosages of quinine and quinidine commonly cause tinnitus, headache, nausea, dizziness, flushing, and visual disturbances, a constellation of symptoms termed cinchonism. Mild symptoms of cinchonism do not warrant the discontinuation of therapy. More severe findings, often after prolonged therapy, include more marked visual and auditory abnormalities, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Hypersensitivity reactions include skin rashes, urticaria, angioedema, and bronchospasm. Hematologic abnormalities include hemolysis (especially with G6PD deficiency), leukopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. Therapeutic doses may cause hypoglycemia through stimulation of insulin release; this is a particular problem in severe infections and in pregnant patients, who have increased sensitivity to insulin. Quinine can stimulate uterine contractions, especially in the third trimester. However, this effect is mild, and quinine and quinidine remain the drugs of choice for severe falciparum malaria even during pregnancy. Intravenous infusions of the drugs may cause thrombophlebitis.

Severe hypotension can follow too-rapid intravenous infusions of quinine or quinidine.
Electrocardiographic abnormalities (QT prolongation) are fairly common with intravenous quinidine, but dangerous arrhythmias are uncommon when the drug is administered appropriately in a monitored setting.

Blackwater fever is a rare severe illness that includes marked hemolysis and hemoglobinuria in the setting of quinine therapy for malaria. It appears to be due to a hypersensitivity reaction to the drug, though its pathogenesis is uncertain.

\section*{Contraindications \& Cautions}

Quinine (or quinidine) should be discontinued if signs of severe cinchonism, hemolysis, or hypersensitivity occur. It should be avoided if possible in patients with underlying visual or auditory problems. It must be used with great caution in those with underlying cardiac abnormalities. Quinine should not be given concurrently with mefloquine and should be used with caution in a patient with malaria who has previously received mefloquine chemoprophylaxis. Absorption may be blocked by aluminum-containing antacids. Quinine can raise plasma levels of warfarin and digoxin. Dosage must be reduced in renal insufficiency.

\section*{MEFLOQUINE}

Mefloquine is effective therapy for many chloroquine-resistant strains of $P$ falciparum and against other species. Although toxicity is a concern, mefloquine is one of the recommended chemoprophylactic drugs for use in most malaria-endemic regions with chloroquine-resistant strains.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Mefloquine hydrochloride is a synthetic 4-quinoline methanol that is chemically related to quinine. It can only be given orally because severe local irritation occurs with parenteral use. It is well absorbed, and peak plasma concentrations are reached in about 18 hours. Mefloquine is highly protein-bound, extensively distributed in tissues, and eliminated slowly, allowing a single-dose treatment regimen. The terminal elimination half-life is about 20 days, allowing weekly dosing for chemoprophylaxis. With weekly dosing, steady-state drug levels are reached over a number of weeks; this interval can be shortened to 4 days by beginning a course with three consecutive daily doses of 250 mg , though this is not standard practice. Mefloquine and acid metabolites of the drug are slowly excreted, mainly in the feces. The drug can be detected in the blood for months after the completion of therapy.

\section*{Antimalarial Action \& Resistance}

\section*{ANTI MALARIAL ACTION}

Mefloquine has strong blood schizonticidal activity against $P$ falciparum and $P$ vivax, but it is not active against hepatic stages or gametocytes. The mechanism of action of mefloquine is unknown.

\section*{RESISTANCE}

Sporadic resistance to mefloquine has been reported from many areas. At present, resistance appears to be uncommon except in regions of Southeast Asia with high rates of multidrug resistance (especially border areas of Thailand). Mefloquine resistance appears to be associated with resistance to quinine and halofantrine but not with resistance to chloroquine.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS}

Mefloquine is effective in prophylaxis against most strains of P falciparum and probably all other human malarial species as well. Mefloquine is therefore among the drugs recommended by the CDC for chemoprophylaxis in all malarious areas except for those with no chloroquine resistance (where chloroquine is preferred) and some rural areas of Southeast Asia with a high prevalence of mefloquine resistance. As with chloroquine, eradication of P vivax and P ovale requires a course of primaquine.

\section*{TREATMENT}

Mefloquine is effective in treating most falciparum malaria. The drug is not appropriate for treating individuals with severe or complicated malaria since quinine and quinidine are more rapidly active and drug resistance is less likely with those agents.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Weekly dosing with mefloquine for chemoprophylaxis may cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sleep and behavioral disturbances, epigastric pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, rash, and dizziness. Neuropsychiatric toxicities have received a good deal of publicity, but despite frequent anecdotal reports of seizures and psychosis, a number of controlled studies have found the frequency of serious adverse effects from mefloquine to be no higher than that with other common antimalarial chemoprophylactic regimens. Leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and aminotransferase elevations have been reported.

The adverse effects listed above are more common with the higher dosages required for treatment. These effects may be lessened by splitting administration of the drug into two doses separated by 6-8
hours. The incidence of neuropsychiatric symptoms appears to be about ten times more common than with chemoprophylactic dosing, with widely varying frequencies of up to about $50 \%$ being reported. Serious neuropsychiatric toxicities (depression, confusion, acute psychosis, or seizures) have been reported in less than one in 1000 treatments, but some authorities believe that these toxicities are actually more common. Mefloquine can also alter cardiac conduction, and arrhythmias and bradycardia have been reported.

\section*{Contraindications \& Cautions}

Mefloquine is contraindicated if there is a history of epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, arrhythmia, cardiac conduction defects, or sensitivity to related drugs. It should not be coadministered with quinine, quinidine, or halofantrine, and caution is required if quinine or quinidine is used to treat malaria after mefloquine chemoprophylaxis. Theoretical risks of mefloquine use must be balanced with the risk of contracting falciparum malaria. The CDC no longer advises against mefloquine use in patients receiving B-adrenoceptor antagonists. Mefloquine is also now considered safe in young children. Available data suggest that mefloquine use is safe throughout pregnancy, although experience in the first trimester is limited. An older recommendation to avoid mefloquine use in those requiring fine motor skills (eg, airline pilots) is controversial. Mefloquine chemoprophylaxis should be discontinued if significant neuropsychiatric symptoms develop.

\section*{PRI MAQUI NE}

Primaquine is the drug of choice for the eradication of dormant liver forms of P vivax and P ovale.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Primaquine phosphate is a synthetic 8-aminoquinoline (Figure 53-1). The drug is well absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma levels in 1-2 hours. The plasma half-life is 3-8 hours. Primaquine is widely distributed to the tissues, but only a small amount is bound there. It is rapidly metabolized and excreted in the urine. Its three major metabolites appear to have less antimalarial activity but more potential for inducing hemolysis than the parent compound.

\section*{Antimalarial Action \& Resistance}

\section*{ANTI MALARIAL ACTION}

Primaquine is active against hepatic stages of all human malaria parasites. It is the only available agent active against the dormant hypnozoite stages of $P$ vivax and $P$ ovale. Primaquine is also gametocidal against the four human malaria species. Primaquine acts against erythrocytic stage parasites, but this activity is too weak to play an important role. The mechanism of antimalarial action is unknown.

\section*{RESISTANCE}

Some strains of P vivax in New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and perhaps Central and South America are relatively resistant to primaquine. Liver forms of these strains may not be eradicated by a single standard treatment with primaquine and may require repeated therapy with increased doses (eg, 30 mg base daily for 14 days) for radical cure.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{THERAPY (RADICAL CURE) OF ACUTE VIVAX AND OVALE MALARIA}

Standard therapy for these infections includes chloroquine to eradicate erythrocytic forms and
primaquine to eradicate liver hypnozoites and prevent a subsequent relapse. Chloroquine is given acutely, and therapy with primaquine is withheld until the G6PD status of the patient is known. If the G6PD level is normal, a 14-day course of primaquine is given.

\section*{TERMINAL PROPHYLAXIS OF VIVAX AND OVALE MALARIA}

Standard chemoprophylaxis does not prevent a relapse of vivax or ovale malaria, as the hypnozoite forms of these parasites are not eradicated by chloroquine or other available agents. To markedly diminish the likelihood of relapse, some authorities advocate the use of primaquine after the completion of travel to an endemic area.

\section*{CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS OF MALARIA}

Primaquine has been studied as a daily chemoprophylactic agent. Daily treatment with $0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ of base provided good levels of protection against falciparum and vivax malaria. However, potential toxicities of long-term use remain a concern, and primaquine is not routinely recommended for this purpose.

\section*{GAMETOCIDAL ACTION}

A single dose of primaquine ( 45 mg base) can be used as a control measure to render P falciparum gametocytes noninfective to mosquitoes. This therapy is of no clinical benefit to the patient but will disrupt transmission.

\section*{PNEUMOCYSTIS JIROVECI INFECTION}

The combination of clindamycin and primaquine is an alternative regimen in the treatment of pneumocystosis, particularly mild to moderate disease. This regimen offers improved tolerance compared with high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or pentamidine, although its efficacy against severe pneumocystis pneumonia is not well studied. (See also Pneumocystosis.)

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Primaquine in recommended doses is generally well tolerated. It infrequently causes nausea, epigastric pain, abdominal cramps, and headache, and these symptoms are more common with higher dosages and when the drug is taken on an empty stomach. More serious but rare adverse effects include leukopenia, agranulocytosis, leukocytosis, and cardiac arrhythmias. Standard doses of primaquine may cause hemolysis or methemoglobinemia (manifested by cyanosis), especially in persons with G6PD deficiency or other hereditary metabolic defects.

\section*{Contraindications \& Cautions}

Primaquine should be avoided in patients with a history of granulocytopenia or methemoglobinemia, in those receiving potentially myelosuppressive drugs (eg, quinidine), and in those with disorders that commonly include myelosuppression. It is never given parenterally because it may induce marked hypotension.

Patients should be tested for G6PD deficiency before primaquine is prescribed. When a patient is deficient in G6PD, treatment strategies may consist of withholding therapy and treating subsequent relapses, if they occur, with chloroquine; treating patients with standard dosing, paying close attention to their hematologic status; or treating with weekly primaquine ( 45 mg base) for 8 weeks. G6PDdeficient individuals of Mediterranean and Asian ancestry are most likely to have severe deficiency, while those of African ancestry usually have a milder biochemical defect. This difference can be taken
into consideration in choosing a treatment strategy. In any event, primaquine should be discontinued if there is evidence of hemolysis or anemia. Primaquine should be avoided in pregnancy because the fetus is relatively G6PD-deficient and thus at risk of hemolysis.

\section*{ATOVAQUONE}

Atovaquone, a hydroxynaphthoquinone (Figure 53-1), was initially developed as an antimalarial and as a component of Malarone is recommended for prophylaxis (Table 53-2). It has also been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of mild to moderate P jiroveci pneumonia.

The drug is only administered orally. Its bioavailability is low and erratic but absorption is increased by fatty food. The drug is heavily protein-bound and has a half-life of $2-3$ days. Most of the drug is eliminated unchanged in the feces. The mechanism of action of atovaquone is uncertain. In plasmodia it appears to disrupt mitochondrial electron transport.

Initial use of atovaquone to treat malaria led to disappointing results, with frequent failures apparently due to the selection of resistant parasites during therapy. In contrast, Malarone, a fixed combination of atovaquone ( 250 mg ) and proguanil ( 100 mg ), is highly effective for both the treatment and chemoprophylaxis of falciparum malaria, and it is now approved for both indications in the USA. For chemoprophylaxis, Malarone must be taken daily (Table 53-2). It has an advantage over mefloquine and doxycycline in requiring shorter periods of treatment before and after the period at risk for malaria transmission, but it is more expensive than the other agents. It should be taken with food.

Atovaquone is an alternative therapy for P jiroveci infection, though its efficacy is lower than that of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Standard dosing is 750 mg taken with food three times daily for 21 days. Adverse effects include fever, rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and insomnia. Serious adverse effects appear to be minimal, although experience with the drug remains limited. Atovaquone has also been effective in small numbers of immunocompromised patients with toxoplasmosis unresponsive to other agents, though its role in this disease is not yet defined.

Malarone is generally well tolerated. Adverse effects include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and rash, and these are more common with the higher dose required for treatment. Reversible elevations in liver enzymes have been reported. The safety of atovaquone in pregnancy is unknown. Plasma concentrations of atovaquone are decreased about $50 \%$ by coadministration of tetracycline or rifampin.

\section*{I NHI BITORS OF FOLATE SYNTHESIS}

Inhibitors of enzymes involved in folate metabolism are used, generally in combination regimens, in the treatment and prevention of malaria.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Pyrimethamine is a 2,4-diaminopyrimidine related to trimethoprim (see Chapter 46). Proguanil is a biguanide derivative (Figure 53-1). Both drugs are slowly but adequately absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Pyrimethamine reaches peak plasma levels $2-6$ hours after an oral dose, is bound to plasma proteins, and has an elimination half-life of about 3.5 days. Proguanil reaches peak plasma levels about 5 hours after an oral dose and has an elimination half-life of about 16 hours. Therefore, proguanil must be administered daily for chemoprophylaxis, whereas pyrimethamine can be given once a week. Pyrimethamine is extensively metabolized before excretion. Proguanil is a prodrug;
only its triazine metabolite, cycloguanil, is active. Fansidar, a fixed combination of the sulfonamide sulfadoxine ( 500 mg per tablet) and pyrimethamine ( 25 mg per tablet), is well absorbed. Its components display peak plasma levels within 2-8 hours and are excreted mainly by the kidneys. The average half-life of sulfadoxine is about 170 hours.

\section*{Antimalarial Action \& Resistance}

\section*{ANTI MALARI AL ACTION}

Pyrimethamine and proguanil act slowly against erythrocytic forms of susceptible strains of all four human malaria species. Proguanil also has some activity against hepatic forms. Neither drug is adequately gametocidal or effective against the persistent liver stages of P vivax or P ovale. Sulfonamides and sulfones are weakly active against erythrocytic schizonts but not against liver stages or gametocytes. They are not used alone as antimalarials but are effective in combination with other agents.

\section*{MECHANISM OF ACTION}

Pyrimethamine and proguanil selectively inhibit plasmodial dihydrofolate reductase, a key enzyme in the pathway for synthesis of folate. Sulfonamides and sulfones inhibit another enzyme in the folate pathway, dihydropteroate synthase. As described in Chapter 46 and shown in Figure 46-2, combinations of inhibitors of these two enzymes provide synergistic activity.

\section*{RESISTANCE}

In many areas, resistance to folate antagonists and sulfonamides is common for P falciparum and less common for P vivax. Resistance is due primarily to mutations in dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase. Because different mutations may mediate resistance to different agents, cross-resistance is not uniformly seen.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS}

Chemoprophylaxis with single folate antagonists is no longer recommended because of frequent resistance, but a number of agents are used in combination regimens. The combination of chloroquine ( 500 mg weekly) and proguanil ( 200 mg daily) is used as an alternative to mefloquine. This combination has lower efficacyâbut also probably less toxicityâthan mefloquine. It is anticipated that the efficacy of the combination will continue to decrease as resistance to both chloroquine and proguanil increases. Fansidar and Maloprim (the latter is a combination of pyrimethamine and the sulfone dapsone) are both effective against sensitive parasites with weekly dosing, but they are no longer recommended because of resistance and toxicity.

\section*{TREATMENT OF CHLOROQUINE-RESISTANT FALCIPARUM MALARIA}

Fansidar is commonly used to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria and it is first-line therapy for this indication in some tropical countries. Advantages of Fansidar in the developing world are relatively low rates of drug resistance and toxicity, ease of administration (a single oral dose), and low cost. However, rates of resistance are increasing. Fansidar is a less optimal regimen than quinine when both drugs are available, especially for nonimmune individuals. It should not be used for severe malaria, as it is slower-acting than other available agents. Fansidar can also be used as an adjunct to quinine therapy to shorten the course of quinine and limit toxicity. Fansidar is not reliably effective in vivax malaria, and its usefulness against $P$ ovale and $P$ malariae has not been adequately studied. A new
antifolate-sulfone combination, chlorproguanil-dapsone, is now available in some countries for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Africa. Chlorproguanil-dapsone is highly effective in regions with fairly high levels of resistance to Fansidar, and its shorter half-life may limit the selection of resistant parasites.

\section*{PRESUMPTIVE TREATMENT OF FALCI PARUM MALARIA}

Fansidar is also used as presumptive therapy for travelers who develop fever while traveling in malaria-endemic regions and who are unable to obtain medical evaluation. Ideally, such patients obtain medical attention as soon as possible after the initiation of therapy to verify the diagnosis and develop an optimal treatment plan. This strategy is increasingly questionable as resistance to Fansidar increases. Alternative presumptive regimens are quinine and mefloquine, which are more toxic but less likely to fail due to drug resistance, or the artemisinin analogs artesunate and artemether, which are not available in the USA.

\section*{TOXOPLASMOSIS}

Pyrimethamine, in combination with sulfadiazine, is first-line therapy in the treatment of toxoplasmosis, including acute infection, congenital infection, and disease in immunocompromised patients. For immunocompromised patients, high-dose therapy is required followed by chronic suppressive therapy. Folinic acid is included to limit myelosuppression. Toxicity from the combination is usually due primarily to sulfadiazine. The replacement of sulfadiazine with clindamycin provides an effective alternative regimen.

\section*{PNEUMOCYSTOSIS}

Pneumocystis jiroveci is the cause of human pneumocystosis and is now recognized to be a fungus, but this organism is discussed in this chapter because it responds to antiprotozoal drugs, not antifungals. (The related species P carinii is now recognized to be the cause of animal infections.) First-line therapy of pneumocystosis is trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole (see also Chapter 46). Standard treatment includes high-dose intravenous ( $15-20 \mathrm{mg}$ trimethoprim and $75-100 \mathrm{mg}$ sulfamethoxazole per day in three or four divided doses) or oral (two double-strength tablets every 8 hours) therapy for 21 days. High-dose therapy entails significant toxicity, especially in patients with AIDS. Important toxicities include nausea, vomiting, fever, rash, leukopenia, hyponatremia, elevated hepatic enzymes, azotemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Less common effects include severe skin reactions, mental status changes, pancreatitis, and hypocalcemia. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is also the standard chemoprophylactic drug for the prevention of P jiroveci infection in immunocompromised individuals. Dosing is one double-strength tablet daily or three times per week. The chemoprophylactic dosing schedule is much better tolerated than high-dose therapy in immunocompromised patients, but rash, fever, leukopenia, or hepatitis may necessitate changing to another drug.

\section*{Adverse Effects \& Cautions}

Most patients tolerate pyrimethamine and proguanil well. Gastrointestinal symptoms, skin rashes, and itching are rare. Mouth ulcers and alopecia have been described with proguanil. Fansidar is no longer recommended for chemoprophylaxis because of uncommon but severe cutaneous reactions, including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Severe reactions appear to be much less common with single-dose therapy, and use of the drug is justified by the risks associated with falciparum malaria. Rare adverse effects with a single dose of Fansidar are those associated with other sulfonamides, including hematologic, gastrointestinal, central nervous system,
dermatologic, and renal toxicity. Maloprim is no longer recommended for chemoprophylaxis because of unacceptably high rates of agranulocytosis. Folate antagonists should be used cautiously in the presence of renal or hepatic dysfunction. Although pyrimethamine is teratogenic in animals, Fansidar has been safely used in pregnancy for therapy and as an intermittent chemoprophylactic regimen to improve pregnancy outcomes. Proguanil is considered safe in pregnancy. With the use of any folate antagonist in pregnancy, folate supplements should be coadministered.

\section*{ANTI BI OTI CS}

A number of antibiotics in addition to the folate antagonists and sulfonamides are modestly active antimalarials. The mechanisms of action of these drugs are unclear. They may inhibit protein synthesis or other functions in two plasmodial prokaryote-like organelles, the mitochondrion and the apicoplast. None of the antibiotics should be used as single agents in the treatment of malaria because their action is much slower than those of standard antimalarials.

Tetracycline and doxycycline (see Chapter 44) are active against erythrocytic schizonts of all human malaria parasites. They are not active against liver stages. Doxycycline is commonly used in the treatment of falciparum malaria in conjunction with quinidine or quinine, allowing a shorter and bettertolerated course of quinine. Doxycycline has also become a standard chemoprophylactic drug, especially for use in areas of Southeast Asia with high rates of resistance to other antimalarials, including mefloquine. Doxycycline side effects include infrequent gastrointestinal symptoms, candidal vaginitis, and photosensitivity. Its safety in long-term chemoprophylaxis has not been extensively evaluated.

Clindamycin (see Chapter 44) is slowly active against erythrocytic schizonts and can be used in conjunction with quinine or quinidine in those for whom doxycycline is not recommended, such as children and pregnant women. Azithromycin (see Chapter 44) also has antimalarial activity and is now under study as an alternative chemoprophylactic drug. Antimalarial activity of fluoroquinolones has been demonstrated, but efficacy for the therapy or chemoprophylaxis of malaria has been suboptimal.

Antibiotics also are active against other protozoans. Tetracycline and erythromycin are alternative therapies for the treatment of intestinal amebiasis. Clindamycin, in combination with other agents, is effective therapy for toxoplasmosis, pneumocystosis, and babesiosis. Spiramycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is used to treat primary toxoplasmosis acquired during pregnancy. Treatment lowers the risk of the development of congenital toxoplasmosis.

\section*{HALOFANTRI NE \& LUMEFANTRI NE}

Halofantrine hydrochloride, a phenanthrene-methanol related to quinine, is effective against erythrocytic (but not other) stages of all four human malaria species. Oral absorption is variable and is enhanced with food. Because of toxicity concerns, it should not be taken with meals. Plasma levels peak 16 hours after dosing, and the half-life is about 4 days. Excretion is mainly in the feces. The mechanism of action of halofantrine is unknown. The drug is not available in the USA (although it has been approved by the FDA), but it is widely available in malaria-endemic countries.

Halofantrine is rapidly effective against most chloroquine-resistant strains of P falciparum, but its use is limited by irregular absorption and cardiac toxicity. Cross-resistance with mefloquine may occur. As treatment for falciparum malaria, halofantrine is given orally in three 500 mg doses at 6 -hour intervals,
and this course is best repeated in 1 week for nonimmune individuals. Because of toxicity concerns and irregular absorption, halofantrine should not be used for chemoprophylaxis.

Halofantrine is generally well tolerated. The most common adverse effects are abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, rash, headache, pruritus, and elevated liver enzymes. Of greater concern, the drug alters cardiac conduction, with dose-related prolongation of QT and PR intervals. This effect is seen with standard doses and is worsened by prior mefloquine therapy. Rare instances of dangerous arrhythmias and some deaths have been reported. The drug is contraindicated in patients with cardiac conduction defects and should not be used in those who have recently taken mefloquine. The drug is embryotoxic in animal studies and is therefore contraindicated in pregnancy.

Lumefantrine, an aryl alcohol related to halofantrine, is available as a fixed-dose combination with artemether as Coartem in some countries. The half-life of lumefantrine, when used in combination, is 4.5 hours. As with halofantrine, oral absorption is highly variable and improved when the drug is taken with food. Coartem is highly effective in the treatment of falciparum malaria, but it is expensive and requires twice-daily dosing. Despite these limitations, due to its reliable efficacy against falciparum malaria, Coartem has recently been selected as the first-line therapy for malaria in many African countries, although implementation of this change has been slow. Coartem does not appear to cause the cardiac toxicity seen with halofantrine.

\section*{ARTEMISININ \& ITS DERIVATIVES}

Artemisinin (qinghaosu) is a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide, the active component of an herbal medicine that has been used as an antipyretic in China for over 2000 years. Artemisinin is insoluble and can only be used orally. Analogs have been synthesized to increase solubility and improve antimalarial efficacy. The most important of these analogs are artesunate (water-soluble; useful for oral, intravenous, intramuscular, and rectal administration) and artemether (lipid-soluble; useful for oral, intramuscular, and rectal administration). Artemisinin and its analogs are rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma levels occurring in 1-2 hours and half-lives of 1-3 hours after oral administration. The compounds are rapidly metabolized to the active metabolite dihydroartemisinin. Drug levels appear to decrease after a number of days of therapy. Dihydroartemisinin is also available as a drug and is under study as combination chemotherapy with piperaquine, a quinoline related to chloroquine. None of the artemisinins are available in the USA, but artemether and artesunate are widely available in other countries.

Artemisinin and analogs are very rapidly acting blood schizonticides against all human malaria parasites. Artemisinins have no effect on hepatic stages. Artemisinin resistance is not yet an important problem, but $P$ falciparum isolates with diminished in vitro susceptibility to artemether have recently been described. The antimalarial activity of artemisinins may result from the production of free radicals that follows the iron-catalyzed cleavage of the artemisinin endoperoxide bridge in the parasite food vacuole or from inhibition of a parasite calcium ATPase.

Artemisinins-in particular artesunate and artemether-are playing an increasingly important role in the treatment of multidrug-resistant $P$ falciparum malaria. They are the only drugs reliably effective against quinine-resistant strains. The efficacy of the artemisinins is limited somewhat by their short plasma half-lives. Recrudescence rates are unacceptably high after short-course therapy, and these drugs are generally best used in conjunction with another agent. Also because of their short-half lives,
they are not useful in chemoprophylaxis. In several studies of severe malaria, artemether and artesunate were about as effective as quinine, though mortality from severe malaria remained high. Artesunate has also been effective in the treatment of severe malaria when administered rectally, offering a valuable treatment modality when parenteral therapy is not available.

Artesunate is widely available-although quite expensive-for the treatment of uncomplicated and severe falciparum malaria. It is commonly used in combination with mefloquine to treat highly resistant falciparum malaria in Thailand. Artemether is available alone and as a fixed-dose combination with lumefantrine (see above). In the setting of multidrug resistance, many authorities now advocate combination therapy with an artemisinin as the optimal treatment for falciparum malaria, and current World Health Organization recommendations list artemether plus lumefantrine, artesunate plus amodiaquine, artesunate plus mefloquine, and artesunate plus sulfadoxine plus pyrimethamine as optimal therapies for uncomplicated malaria in regions with resistance to older drugs. However, concerns regarding high cost, limited availability, and potential toxicity remain.

Artemisinins appear to be better tolerated than most antimalarials. The most commonly reported adverse effects have been nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Irreversible neurotoxicity has been seen in animals, but only after doses much higher than those used to treat malaria. Artemisinins should be avoided in pregnancy if possible because teratogenicity has been seen in animal studies, but limited inadvertent use in pregnancy has apparently not led to fetal problems.

\section*{TREATMENT OF AMEBI ASIS}

Amebiasis is infection with Entamoeba histolytica. This organism can cause asymptomatic intestinal infection, mild to moderate colitis, severe intestinal infection (dysentery), ameboma, liver abscess, and other extraintestinal infections. The choice of drugs for amebiasis depends on the clinical presentation (Figure 53-2; Table 53-4).

\section*{Treatment of Specific Forms of Amebiasis}

\section*{ASYMPTOMATIC INTESTINAL INFECTION}

Asymptomatic carriers generally are not treated in endemic areas but in nonendemic areas they are treated with a luminal amebicide. A tissue amebicidal drug is unnecessary. Standard luminal amebicides are diloxanide furoate, iodoquinol, and paromomycin. Each drug eradicates carriage in about $80-90 \%$ of patients with a single course of treatment. Therapy with a luminal amebicide is also required in the treatment of all other forms of amebiasis.

\section*{AMEBIC COLITIS}

Metronidazole plus a luminal amebicide is the treatment of choice for colitis and dysentery.
Tetracyclines and erythromycin are alternative drugs for moderate colitis but are not effective against extraintestinal disease. Dehydroemetine or emetine can also be used, but are best avoided because of toxicity.

\section*{EXTRAI NTESTI NAL I NFECTI ONS}

The treatment of choice is metronidazole plus a luminal amebicide. A 10-day course of metronidazole cures over 95\% of uncomplicated liver abscesses. For unusual cases in which initial therapy with metronidazole has failed, aspiration of the abscess and the addition of chloroquine to a repeat course of metronidazole should be considered. Dehydroemetine and emetine are toxic alternative drugs.

\section*{METRONI DAZOLE \& TI NI DAZOLE}

Metronidazole, a nitroimidazole (Figure 53-2), is the drug of choice in the treatment of extraluminal amebiasis. It kills trophozoites but not cysts of E histolytica and effectively eradicates intestinal and extraintestinal tissue infections. Tinidazole, a related nitroimidazole, appears to have similar activity and a better toxicity profile than metronidazole, and it offers simpler dosing regimens. It has been available in the USA since 2004 and can be substituted for the indications listed below.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Oral metronidazole and tinidazole are readily absorbed and permeate all tissues by simple diffusion. Intracellular concentrations rapidly approach extracellular levels. Peak plasma concentrations are reached in 1-3 hours. Protein binding of both drugs is low (10-20\%); the half-life of unchanged drug is 7.5 hours for metronidazole and 12-14 hours for tinidazole. Metronidazole and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine. Plasma clearance of metronidazole is decreased in patients with impaired liver function.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

The nitro group of metronidazole is chemically reduced in anaerobic bacteria and sensitive protozoans. Reactive reduction products appear to be responsible for antimicrobial activity. The mechanism of tinidazole is assumed to be the same.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{AMEBIASIS}

Metronidazole or tinidazole is the drug of choice in the treatment of all tissue infections with E histolytica. They are not reliably effective against luminal parasites and so must be used with a luminal amebicide to ensure eradication of the infection.

\section*{GIARDIASIS}

Metronidazole is the treatment of choice for giardiasis. The dosage for giardiasis is much lower-and the drug thus better tolerated-than that for amebiasis. Efficacy after a single treatment is about $90 \%$. Tinidazole is at least equally effective.

\section*{TRICHOMONIASIS}

Metronidazole is the treatment of choice. A single dose of 2 g is effective. Metronidazole-resistant organisms can lead to treatment failures. Tinidazole may be effective against some of these resistant organisms.

\section*{Adverse Effects \& Cautions}

Nausea, headache, dry mouth, or a metallic taste in the mouth occurs commonly. Infrequent adverse effects include vomiting, diarrhea, insomnia, weakness, dizziness, thrush, rash, dysuria, dark urine, vertigo, paresthesias, and neutropenia. Taking the drug with meals lessens gastrointestinal irritation. Pancreatitis and severe central nervous system toxicity (ataxia, encephalopathy, seizures) are rare. Metronidazole has a disulfiram-like effect, so that nausea and vomiting can occur if alcohol is ingested during therapy. The drug should be used with caution in patients with central nervous system disease. Intravenous infusions have rarely caused seizures or peripheral neuropathy. The dosage should be adjusted for patients with severe liver or renal disease. Tinidazole has a similar adverse effect profile, although it appears to be somewhat better tolerated than metronidazole.

Metronidazole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-type anticoagulants. Phenytoin and phenobarbital may accelerate elimination of the drug, while cimetidine may decrease plasma clearance. Lithium toxicity may occur when the drug is used with metronidazole.

Metronidazole and its metabolites are mutagenic in bacteria. Chronic administration of large doses led to tumorigenicity in mice. Data on teratogenicity are inconsistent. Metronidazole is thus best avoided in pregnant or nursing women, although congenital abnormalities have not clearly been associated with use in humans.

\section*{I ODOQUI NOL}

Iodoquinol (diiodohydroxyquin) is a halogenated hydroxyquinoline. It is an effective luminal amebicide that is commonly used with metronidazole to treat amebic infections. Its pharmacokinetic properties are poorly understood. Ninety percent of the drug is retained in the intestine and excreted in the feces. The remainder enters the circulation, has a half-life of 11-14 hours, and is excreted in the urine as glucuronides.

The mechanism of action of iodoquinol against trophozoites is unknown. It is effective against organisms in the bowel lumen but not against trophozoites in the intestinal wall or extraintestinal tissues.

Infrequent adverse effects include diarrhea-which usually stops after several days-anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, rash, and pruritus. The drug may increase protein-bound serum iodine, leading to a decrease in measured ${ }^{131}$ l uptake that persists for months. Some halogenated
hydroxyquinolines can produce severe neurotoxicity with prolonged use at greater than recommended doses. Iodoquinol is not known to produce these effects at its recommended dosage, and this dosage should never be exceeded.

Iodoquinol should be taken with meals to limit gastrointestinal toxicity. It should be used with caution in patients with optic neuropathy, renal or thyroid disease, or nonamebic hepatic disease. The drug should be discontinued if it produces persistent diarrhea or signs of iodine toxicity (dermatitis, urticaria, pruritus, fever). It is contraindicated in patients with intolerance to iodine.

\section*{DILOXANI DE FUROATE}

Diloxanide furoate is a dichloroacetamide derivative. It is an effective luminal amebicide but is not active against tissue trophozoites. In the gut, diloxanide furoate is split into diloxanide and furoic acid; about $90 \%$ of the diloxanide is rapidly absorbed and then conjugated to form the glucuronide, which is promptly excreted in the urine. The unabsorbed diloxanide is the active antiamebic substance. The mechanism of action of diloxanide furoate is unknown.

Diloxanide furoate is considered by many the drug of choice for asymptomatic luminal infections, but it is no longer available in the USA. It is used with a tissue amebicide, usually metronidazole, to treat serious intestinal and extraintestinal infections. Diloxanide furoate does not produce serious adverse effects. Flatulence is common, but nausea and abdominal cramps are infrequent and rashes are rare. The drug is not recommended in pregnancy.

\section*{PAROMOMYCI N SULFATE}

Paromomycin sulfate is an aminoglycoside antibiotic (see also Chapter 45) that is not significantly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is used only as a luminal amebicide and has no effect against extraintestinal amebic infections. The small amount absorbed is slowly excreted unchanged, mainly by glomerular filtration. However, the drug may accumulate with renal insufficiency and contribute to renal toxicity. Paromomycin is an effective luminal amebicide that appears to have similar efficacy and probably less toxicity than other agents; in a recent study, it was superior to diloxanide furoate in clearing asymptomatic infections. Adverse effects include occasional abdominal distress and diarrhea. Paromomycin should be avoided in patients with significant renal disease and used with caution in persons with gastrointestinal ulcerations. Parenteral paromomycin is under investigation in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis.

\section*{EMETI NE \& DEHYDROEMETI NE}

Emetine, an alkaloid derived from ipecac, and dehydroemetine, a synthetic analog, are effective against tissue trophozoites of E histolytica, but because of major toxicity concerns they have been almost completely replaced by metronidazole.

Their use is limited to unusual circumstances in which severe amebiasis warrants effective therapy and metronidazole cannot be used. Dehydroemetine is preferred because of its somewhat better toxicity profile. The drugs should be used for the minimum period needed to relieve severe symptoms (usually 3-5 days).

Emetine and dehydroemetine should be administered subcutaneously (preferred) or intramuscularly (but never intravenously) in a supervised setting. Adverse effects are generally mild when the drugs are used for 3-5 days but increase with prolonged use. Pain and tenderness in the area of injection are
frequent, and sterile abscesses may develop. Diarrhea is common. Other adverse effects are nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness and discomfort, and minor electrocardiographic changes. Serious toxicities include cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and hypotension. The drugs should not be used in patients with cardiac or renal disease, in young children, or in pregnancy unless absolutely necessary.

\section*{OTHER ANTI PROTOZOAL DRUGS}

\section*{PENTAMI DI NE}

Pentamidine has activity against trypanosomatid protozoans and against P jiroveci, but toxicity is significant.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Pentamidine is an aromatic diamidine (Figure 53-2) formulated as an isethionate salt. Pentamidine is only administered parenterally. The drug leaves the circulation rapidly, with an initial half-life of about 6 hours, but it is bound avidly by tissues. Pentamidine thus accumulates and is eliminated very slowly,
with a terminal elimination half-life of about 12 days. The drug can be detected in urine 6 or more weeks after treatment. Only trace amounts of pentamidine appear in the central nervous system, so it is not effective against central nervous system African trypanosomiasis. Pentamidine can also be inhaled as a nebulized powder for the prevention of pneumocystosis. Absorption into the systemic circulation after inhalation appears to be minimal. The mechanism of action of pentamidine is unknown.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{PNEUMOCYSTOSIS}

Pentamidine is a well-established alternative therapy for pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease caused by P jiroveci. The drug has somewhat lower efficacy and greater toxicity than trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. The standard dosage is $3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ intravenously for 21 days. Significant adverse reactions are common, and with multiple regimens now available to treat P jiroveci infection, pentamidine is best reserved for patients with severe disease who cannot tolerate or fail other drugs.

Pentamidine is also an alternative agent for primary or secondary prophylaxis against pneumocystosis in immunocompromised individuals, including patients with advanced AIDS. For this indication, pentamidine is administered as an inhaled aerosol ( 300 mg inhaled monthly). The drug is welltolerated in this form. Its efficacy is very good but clearly less than that of daily trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. Because of its cost and ineffectiveness against nonpulmonary disease, it is best reserved for patients who cannot tolerate oral chemoprophylaxis with other drugs.

\section*{AFRICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS (SLEEPING SICKNESS)}

Pentamidine has been used since 1940 as an alternative to suramin for the early hemolymphatic stage of disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei (especially T brucei gambiense). The drug can also be used with suramin. Pentamidine should not be used to treat late trypanosomiasis with central nervous system involvement. A number of dosing regimens have been described, generally providing 2-4 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ daily or on alternate days for a total of 10-15 doses. Pentamidine has also been used for chemoprophylaxis against African trypanosomiasis, with dosing of $4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ every $3-6$ months.

\section*{LEI SHMANIASIS}

Pentamidine is an alternative to sodium stibogluconate in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis, although resistance has been reported. The drug has been successful in some cases that have failed therapy with antimonials. The dosage is $2-4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ intramuscularly daily or every other day for up to 15 doses, and a second course may be necessary. Pentamidine has also shown success against cutaneous leishmaniasis, but it is not routinely used for this purpose.

\section*{Adverse Effects \& Cautions}

Pentamidine is a highly toxic drug, with adverse effects noted in about $50 \%$ of patients receiving 4 mg/kg/d. Rapid intravenous administration can lead to severe hypotension, tachycardia, dizziness, and dyspnea, so the drug should be administered slowly (over 2 hours) and patients should be recumbent and monitored closely during treatment. With intramuscular administration, pain at the injection site is common and sterile abscesses may develop.

Pancreatic toxicity is common. Hypoglycemia due to inappropriate insulin release often appears 5-7 days after onset of treatment, can persist for days to several weeks, and may be followed by hyperglycemia. Reversible renal insufficiency is also common. Other adverse effects include rash,
metallic taste, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, abnormal liver function tests, acute pancreatitis, hypocalcemia, thrombocytopenia, hallucinations, and cardiac arrhythmias. Inhaled pentamidine is generally well-tolerated but may cause cough, dyspnea, and bronchospasm.

\section*{SODI UM STI BOGLUCONATE}

Pentavalent antimonials, including sodium stibogluconate (pentostam; Figure 53-2) and meglumine antimonate, are generally considered first-line agents for cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. The drugs are rapidly absorbed after intravenous (preferred) or intramuscular administration and eliminated in two phases, with short initial (about 2 hour) and much longer terminal (> 24 hour) halflives. Treatment is given once daily at a dose of $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ intravenously or intramuscularly for 20 days in cutaneous leishmaniasis and 28 days in visceral and mucocutaneous disease.

The mechanism of action of the antimonials is unknown. Their efficacy against different species may vary, possibly based on local drug resistance patterns. Cure rates are generally quite good, but resistance to sodium stibogluconate is increasing in some endemic areas. Some authorities have advocated initial therapy with other agents (eg, amphotericin B) in areas (such as parts of India) where therapy with sodium stibogluconate is commonly ineffective.

Few adverse effects occur initially, but the toxicity of stibogluconate increases over the course of therapy. Most common are gastrointestinal symptoms, fever, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, and rash. Intramuscular injections can be very painful and lead to sterile abscesses. Electrocardiographic changes may occur, most commonly T wave changes and QT prolongation. These changes are generally reversible, but continued therapy may lead to dangerous arrhythmias. Thus, the electrocardiogram should be monitored during therapy. Hemolytic anemia and serious liver, renal, and cardiac effects are rare.

\section*{NITAZOXANI DE}

Nitazoxanide is a nitrothiazolyl-salicylamide prodrug. Nitazoxanide was recently approved in the USA for use against Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum. It is rapidly absorbed and converted to tizoxanide and tizoxanide conjugates, which are subsequently excreted in both urine and feces. The active metabolite, tizoxanide, inhibits the pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase pathway. Nitazoxanide appears to have activity against metronidazole-resistant protozoal strains and is well tolerated. Unlike metronidazole, nitazoxanide and its metabolites appear to be free of mutagenic effects. Other organisms that may be susceptible to nitazoxanide include E histolytica, Helicobacter pylori, Ascaris lumbricoides, several tapeworms, and Fasciola hepatica.

The recommended adult dosage is 500 mg twice daily for 3 days.

\section*{OTHER DRUGS FOR TRYPANOSOMI ASIS \& LEISHMANIASIS}

Currently available therapies for all forms of trypanosomiasis are seriously deficient in both efficacy and safety. Availability of these therapies is also a concern, as they remain available mainly through donation or nonprofit production by pharmaceutical companies.

\section*{SURAMI N}

Suramin is a sulfated naphthylamine that was introduced in the 1920s. It is the first-line therapy for early hemolymphatic African trypanosomiasis (especially T brucei gambiense infection), but because it does not enter the central nervous system, it is not effective against advanced disease. The drug's
mechanism of action is unknown. It is administered intravenously and displays complex pharmacokinetics with very tight protein binding. It has a short initial half-life but a terminal elimination half-life of about 50 days. The drug is slowly cleared by renal excretion.

Suramin is administered after a 200 mg intravenous test dose. Regimens that have been used include 1 g on days $1,3,7,14$, and 21 or 1 g each week for 5 weeks. Combination therapy with pentamidine may improve efficacy. Suramin can also be used for chemoprophylaxis against African trypanosomiasis. Adverse effects are common. Immediate reactions can include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and, more rarely, seizures, shock, and death. Later reactions include fever, rash, headache, paresthesias, neuropathies, renal abnormalities including proteinuria, chronic diarrhea, hemolytic anemia, and agranulocytosis.

\section*{MELARSOPROL}

Melarsoprol is a trivalent arsenical that has been available since 1949 and is first-line therapy for advanced central nervous system African trypanosomiasis. After intravenous administration it is excreted rapidly, but clinically relevant concentrations accumulate in the central nervous system within 4 days. Melarsoprol is administered in propylene glycol by slow intravenous infusion at a dosage of 3.6 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ for $3-4$ days, with repeated courses at weekly intervals if needed. A new regimen of 2.2 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ daily for 10 days had efficacy and toxicity similar to what was observed with three courses over 26 days. Melarsoprol is extremely toxic. The use of such a toxic drug is justified only by the severity of advanced trypanosomiasis and the lack of available alternatives. Immediate adverse effects include fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, and arthralgias. The most important toxicity is a reactive encephalopathy that generally appears within the first week of therapy (in $5-10 \%$ of patients) and is probably due to disruption of trypanosomes in the central nervous system. Common consequences of the encephalopathy include cerebral edema, seizures, coma, and death. Other serious toxicities include renal and cardiac disease and hypersensitivity reactions. Failure rates with melarsoprol appear to have increased recently in parts of Africa, suggesting the possibility of drug resistance.

\section*{EFLORNITHINE}

Eflornithine (difluoromethylornithine), an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, is the only new drug registered to treat African trypanosomiasis in the last half-century. It is a second therapy for advanced central nervous system African trypanosomiasis and is less toxic than melarsoprol but not as widely available. The drug had very limited availability until recently, when it was developed for use as a topical depilatory cream, leading to donation of the drug for the treatment of trypanosomiasis. Eflornithine is administered intravenously, and good central nervous system drug levels are achieved. Peak plasma levels are reached rapidly, and the elimination half-life is about 3 hours. The usual regimen is $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ intravenously every 6 hours for $7-14$ days ( 14 days was superior for a newly diagnosed infection). An oral formulation is also available and under clinical investigation. Eflornithine appears to be as effective as melarsoprol against advanced T brucei gambiense infection, but its efficacy against T brucei rhodesiense is limited by drug resistance. Toxicity from eflornithine is significant, but considerably less than that from melarsoprol. Adverse effects include diarrhea, vomiting, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and seizures. These effects are generally reversible. Increased experience with eflornithine and increased availability of the compound in endemic areas may lead to its replacement of suramin, pentamidine, and melarsoprol in the treatment of T brucei gambiense infection.

\section*{NI FURTI MOX}

Nifurtimox, a nitrofuran, is the most commonly used drug for American trypanosomiasis (Chagas' disease). Nifurtimox is also under study in the treatment of African trypanosomiasis. Nifurtimox is well absorbed after oral administration and eliminated with a plasma half-life of about 3 hours. The drug is administered at a dose of $8-10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ (divided into three to four doses) orally for 3-4 months in the treatment of acute Chagas' disease. Nifurtimox decreases the severity of acute disease and usually eliminates detectable parasites, but it is often ineffective in fully eradicating infection. Thus, it often fails to prevent progression to the gastrointestinal and cardiac syndromes associated with chronic infection that are the most important clinical consequences of Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Efficacy may vary in different parts of South America, possibly related to drug resistance in some areas. Nifurtimox does not appear to be effective in the treatment of chronic Chagas' disease. Toxicity related to nifurtimox is common. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, rash, restlessness, insomnia, neuropathies, and seizures. These effects are generally reversible but often lead to cessation of therapy before completion of a standard course.

\section*{BENZNI DAZOLE}

Benznidazole is an orally administered nitroimidazole that appears to have efficacy similar to that of nifurtimox in the treatment of acute Chagas' disease. Availability of the drug is currently limited. Important toxicities include peripheral neuropathy, rash, gastrointestinal symptoms, and myelosuppression.

\section*{AMPHOTERI CI N}

This important antifungal drug (see Chapter 48) is an alternative therapy for visceral leishmaniasis, especially in parts of India with high-level resistance to sodium stibogluconate, but its use is limited in developing countries by difficulty of administration, cost, and toxicity.

\section*{MILTEFOSINE}

Miltefosine is an alkylphosphocholine analog that has recently shown efficacy in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. In a recent phase III study, the drug was administered orally with daily doses of $2.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ for 28 days and provided excellent clinical results. A 100 mg daily dose is recommended in adults. Vomiting and diarrhea are common but generally short-lived toxicities. Transient elevations in liver enzymes and nephrotoxicity are also seen. The drug should be avoided in pregnancy (or in women who may become pregnant within 2 months of treatment) because of its teratogenic effects. Miltefosine is registered for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in India and some other countries, and-considering the serious limitations of other drugs, including parenteral administration, toxicity, and resistance-it may become the treatment of choice for that disease.

\section*{ALBENDAZOLE}

Albendazole, a broad-spectrum oral anthelmintic, is the drug of choice and is approved in the USA for treatment of hydatid disease and cysticercosis. It is also used in the treatment of pinworm and hookworm infections, ascariasis, trichuriasis, and strongyloidiasis, although it is not labeled for these conditions.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Albendazole is a benzimidazole carbamate. After oral administration, it is erratically absorbed (increased with a fatty meal) and then rapidly undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver to the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. It reaches variable maximum plasma concentrations about 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose, and its plasma half-life is $8-12$ hours. The sulfoxide is mostly proteinbound, distributes well to tissues, and enters bile, cerebrospinal fluid, and hydatid cysts. Albendazole metabolites are excreted in the urine.
<smiles>CCCCCSc1ccc2[nH]c(NC(=O)OC)nc2c1</smiles>

Albendazole

\section*{Anthelmintic Actions}

Benzimidazoles are thought to act against nematodes by inhibiting microtubule synthesis. Albendazole also has larvicidal effects in hydatid disease, cysticercosis, ascariasis, and hookworm infection and ovicidal effects in ascariasis, ancylostomiasis, and trichuriasis.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Albendazole is administered on an empty stomach when used against intraluminal parasites but with a fatty meal when used against tissue parasites.

\section*{ASCARIASIS, TRICHURIASIS, AND HOOKWORM AND PINWORM INFECTIONS}

For adults and children older than 2 years of age, the treatment is a single dose of 400 mg orally (repeated for 2-3 days for heavy ascaris infections and in 2 weeks for pinworm infections). These treatments achieve high cure rates for these roundworm infections and marked reduction in egg counts in those not cured.

\section*{HYDATID DISEASE}

Albendazole is the treatment of choice for medical therapy and is a useful adjunct to surgical removal or aspiration of cysts. It is more active against Echinococcus granulosus than E multilocularis. Dosing is 400 mg twice daily with meals for 1 month or longer. Daily therapy for up to 6 months has been well tolerated. One reported therapeutic strategy is to treat with albendazole and praziquantel, to assess response after 1 month or more, and, depending on the response, to then manage the patient with continued chemotherapy or combined surgical and drug therapy.

\section*{NEUROCYSTI CERCOSIS}

Indications for medical therapy for neurocysticercosis are controversial, as anthelmintic therapy is not clearly superior to therapy with corticosteroids alone and may exacerbate neurologic disease. Therapy is probably most appropriate for symptomatic parenchymal or intraventricular cysts. Corticosteroids are usually given with the anthelmintic drug to decrease inflammation caused by dying organisms. Albendazole is now generally considered the drug of choice over praziquantel because of its shorter course, lower cost, improved penetration into the subarachnoid space, and increased drug levels (as opposed to decreased levels of praziquantel) when administered with corticosteroids. Albendazole is given in a dosage of 400 mg twice a day for up to 21 days.

\section*{OTHER INFECTIONS}

Albendazole is the drug of choice in the treatment of cutaneous larva migrans ( 400 mg daily for 3 days), visceral larva migrans ( 400 mg twice daily for 5 days), intestinal capillariasis ( 400 mg daily for 10 days), microsporidial infections ( 400 mg twice daily for 2 weeks or longer), and gnathostomiasis ( 400 mg twice daily for 3 weeks). It also has activity against trichinosis ( 400 mg twice daily for 1-2 weeks) and clonorchiasis ( 400 mg twice daily for 1 week). There have been reports of some
effectiveness in treatment of opisthorchiasis, toxocariasis, and loiasis and conflicting reports of effectiveness in giardiasis and taeniasis. Albendazole is included in some programs to control lymphatic filariasis, but it appears to be less active than diethylcarbamazine or ivermectin for this purpose.

\section*{Adverse Reactions, Contraindications, \& Cautions}

When used for 1-3 days, albendazole is nearly free of significant adverse effects. Mild and transient epigastric distress, diarrhea, headache, nausea, dizziness, lassitude, and insomnia can occur. In longterm use for hydatid disease, albendazole is well tolerated, but it can cause abdominal distress, headaches, fever, fatigue, alopecia, increases in liver enzymes, and pancytopenia.

Blood counts and liver function studies should be followed during long-term therapy. The drug should not be given to patients with known hypersensitivity to other benzimidazole drugs or to those with cirrhosis. The safety of albendazole in pregnancy and in children younger than 2 years of age has not been established.

\section*{BITHIONOL}

Bithionol is the drug of choice for the treatment of fascioliasis (sheep liver fluke). An alternative drug, triclabendazole, is not available in the USA.

Bithionol is also an alternative drug in the treatment of pulmonary paragonimiasis.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

After ingestion, bithionol reaches peak blood levels in 4-8 hours. Excretion appears to be mainly via the kidney.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

For treatment of paragonimiasis and fascioliasis, the dosage of bithionol is $30-50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ in two or three divided doses, given orally after meals on alternate days for 10-15 doses. For pulmonary paragonimiasis, cure rates are over $90 \%$. For cerebral paragonimiasis, repeat courses of therapy may be necessary.

\section*{Adverse Reactions, Contraindications, \& Cautions}

Adverse effects, which occur in up to $40 \%$ of patients, are generally mild and transient, but occasionally their severity requires interruption of therapy. These problems include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. Skin rashes may occur after a week or more of therapy, suggesting a reaction to antigens released from dying worms.

Bithionol should be used with caution in children younger than 8 years of age because there has been limited experience in this age group.

\section*{DI ETHYLCARBAMAZI NE CI TRATE}

Diethylcarbamazine is a drug of choice in the treatment of filariasis, loiasis, and tropical eosinophilia. It has been replaced by ivermectin for the treatment of onchocerciasis.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Diethylcarbamazine, a synthetic piperazine derivative, is marketed as a citrate salt. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; after a $0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ dose, peak plasma levels are reached within 1-2 hours. The plasma half-life is 2-3 hours in the presence of acidic urine but about 10 hours if the urine is alkaline, a Henderson-Hasselbalch trapping effect (see Chapter 1). The drug rapidly equilibrates with all tissues except fat. It is excreted, principally in the urine, as unchanged drug and the N -oxide metabolite. Dosage may have to be reduced in patients with persistent urinary alkalosis or renal impairment.

\section*{Anthelmintic Actions}

Diethylcarbamazine immobilizes microfilariae and alters their surface structure, displacing them from tissues and making them more susceptible to destruction by host defense mechanisms. The mode of action against adult worms is unknown.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

The drug should be taken after meals.

Diethylcarbamazine is the drug of choice for treatment of infections with these parasites because of its efficacy and lack of serious toxicity. Microfilariae of all species are rapidly killed; adult parasites are killed more slowly, often requiring several courses of treatment. The drug is highly effective against adult L loa. The extent to which W bancrofti and B malayi adults are killed is not known, but after appropriate therapy microfilariae do not reappear in the majority of patients.

These infections are treated for 2 or (for L loa) 3 weeks, with initial low doses to reduce the incidence of allergic reactions to dying microfilariae. This regimen is 50 mg ( $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ in children) on day 1 , three 50 mg doses on day 2, three 100 mg doses ( $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ in children) on day 3, and then $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ three times per day to complete the 2-3 week course.

Antihistamines may be given for the first few days of therapy to limit allergic reactions, and corticosteroids should be started and doses of diethylcarbamazine lowered or interrupted if severe reactions occur. Cures may require several courses of treatment.

Diethylcarbamazine may also be used for chemoprophylaxis ( 300 mg weekly or 300 mg on 3 successive days each month for loiasis; 50 mg monthly for bancroftian and Malayan filariasis).

\section*{OTHER USES}

For tropical eosinophilia, diethylcarbamazine is given orally at a dosage of $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ three times daily for 7 days. Diethylcarbamazine is effective in Mansonella streptocerca infections, since it kills both adults and microfilariae. Limited information suggests that the drug is not effective, however, against adult M ozzardi or M perstans and that it has limited activity against microfilariae of these parasites. An important application of diethylcarbamazine has been its use for mass treatment of W bancrofti infections to reduce transmission. Weekly or monthly administration regimens have been studied; and, most recently, yearly treatment (with or without ivermectin) markedly reduced reservoirs of infection in Papua New Guinea.

\section*{Adverse Reactions, Contraindications, \& Cautions}

Reactions to diethylcarbamazine, which are generally mild and transient, include headache, malaise, anorexia, weakness, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Adverse effects also occur as a result of the
release of proteins from dying microfilariae or adult worms. Reactions are particularly severe with onchocerciasis, but diethylcarbamazine is no longer commonly used for this infection, as ivermectin is equally efficacious and less toxic. Reactions to dying microfilariae are usually mild in W bancrofti, more intense in B malayi, and occasionally severe in L loa infections. Reactions include fever, malaise, papular rash, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, cough, chest pain, and muscle or joint pain. Leukocytosis is common. Eosinophilia may increase with treatment. Proteinuria may also occur. Symptoms are most likely to occur in patients with heavy loads of microfilariae. Retinal hemorrhages and, rarely, encephalopathy have been described.

Between the third and twelfth days of treatment, local reactions may occur in the vicinity of dying adult or immature worms. These include lymphangitis with localized swellings in W bancrofti and B malayi, small wheals in the skin in L loa, and flat papules in M streptocerca infections. Patients with attacks of lymphangitis due to W bancrofti or B malayi should be treated during a quiescent period between attacks.

Caution is advised when using diethylcarbamazine in patients with hypertension or renal disease.

\section*{DOXYCYCLI NE}

This tetracycline antibiotic is described in more detail in Chapter 44. Doxycycline has recently been shown to have significant macrofilaricidal activity against W bancrofti, suggesting better activity than any other available drug against adult worms. Activity is also seen against onchocerciasis. Doxycycline acts indirectly, by killing Wolbachia, an intracellular bacterial symbiont of filarial parasites. It may prove to be an important drug for filariasis, both for treatment of active disease and in mass chemotherapy campaigns.

\section*{I VERMECTI N}

Ivermectin is the drug of choice in strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis. It is also an alternative drug for a number of other helminthic infections.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Ivermectin, a semisynthetic macrocyclic lactone, is a mixture of avermectin $\mathrm{B}_{1 \mathrm{a}}$ and $\mathrm{B}_{1 \mathrm{~b}}$. It is derived from the soil actinomycete Streptomyces avermitilis.

Ivermectin is used only orally in humans. The drug is rapidly absorbed, reaching maximum plasma concentrations 4 hours after a 12 mg dose. The drug has a wide tissue distribution and a volume of distribution of about 50 L . Its half-life is about 16 hours. Excretion of the drug and its metabolites is almost exclusively in the feces.

\section*{Anthelmintic Actions}

Ivermectin appears to paralyze nematodes and arthropods by intensifying $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated transmission of signals in peripheral nerves. In onchocerciasis, ivermectin is microfilaricidal. It does not effectively kill adult worms but blocks the release of microfilariae for some months after therapy. After a single standard dose, microfilariae in the skin diminish rapidly within 2-3 days, remain low for months, and then gradually increase; microfilariae in the anterior chamber of the eye decrease slowly over months, eventually clear, and then gradually return. With repeated
doses of ivermectin, the drug does appear to have a low-level macrofilaricidal action and to permanently reduce microfilarial production.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{ONCHOCERCIASIS}

Treatment is with a single oral dose of ivermectin, $150 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg}$, with water on an empty stomach. Doses are repeated; regimens vary from monthly to less frequent (every 6-12 months) dosing schedules. After acute therapy, treatment is repeated at 12-month intervals until the adult worms die, which may take 10 years or longer. With the first treatment only, patients with microfilariae in the cornea or anterior chamber may be treated with corticosteroids to avoid inflammatory eye reactions.

Ivermectin also now plays a key role in onchocerciasis control. Annual mass treatments have led to major reductions in disease transmission.

\section*{STRONGYLOIDIASIS}

Treatment consists of two daily doses of $200 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg}$. In immunosuppressed patients with disseminated infection, repeated treatment is often needed, but cure may not be possible. In this case, suppressive therapy-ie, once monthly-may be helpful.

\section*{OTHER PARASITES}

Ivermectin reduces microfilariae in Brugia malayi and M ozzardi infections but not in M perstans infections. It has been used with diethylcarbamazine for the control of W bancrofti, but it does not kill adult worms, and whether it offers added benefit is uncertain. In loiasis, although the drug reduces microfilaria concentrations, it can occasionally induce severe reactions. Ivermectin is also effective in controlling scabies, lice, and cutaneous larva migrans and in eliminating a large proportion of ascarid worms.

\section*{Adverse Reactions, Contraindications, \& Cautions}

In strongyloidiasis treatment, infrequent side effects include fatigue, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and rashes. In onchocerciasis treatment, the adverse effects are principally from the Mazotti reaction, due to killing of microfilariae. The reaction includes fever, headache, dizziness, somnolence, weakness, rash, increased pruritus, diarrhea, joint and muscle pains, hypotension, tachycardia, lymphadenitis, lymphangitis, and peripheral edema. This reaction starts on the first day and peaks on the second day after treatment. The Mazotti reaction occurs in 5-30\% of persons and is generally mild, but it may be more frequent and more severe in individuals who are not long-term residents of onchocerciasis-endemic areas. A more intense Mazotti reaction occurs in $1-3 \%$ of persons and a severe reaction in $0.1 \%$, including high fever, hypotension, and bronchospasm. Corticosteroids are indicated in these cases, at times for several days. The Mazotti reaction diminishes with repeated dosing. Swellings and abscesses occasionally occur at 1-3 weeks, presumably at sites of adult worms.

Some patients develop corneal opacities and other eye lesions several days after treatment. These are rarely severe and generally resolve without corticosteroid treatment.

It is best to avoid concomitant use of ivermectin and other drugs that enhance GABA activity, eg, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and valproic acid. Ivermectin should not be used in pregnancy. Safety
in children younger than 5 years has not been established.

\section*{MEBENDAZOLE}

Mebendazole is a synthetic benzimidazole that has a wide spectrum of anthelmintic activity and a low incidence of adverse effects.
<smiles>COC(=O)Nc1nc2cc(C(=O)c3ccccc3)ccc2[nH]1</smiles>

Mebendazole

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Less than $10 \%$ of orally administered mebendazole is absorbed. The absorbed drug is protein-bound ( $>90 \%$ ), rapidly converted to inactive metabolites (primarily during its first pass in the liver), and has a half-life of 2-6 hours. It is excreted mostly in the urine, principally as decarboxylated derivatives. In addition, a portion of absorbed drug and its derivatives are excreted in the bile. Absorption is increased if the drug is ingested with a fatty meal.

\section*{Anthelmintic Actions}

Mebendazole probably acts by inhibiting microtubule synthesis; the parent drug appears to be the active form. Efficacy of the drug varies with gastrointestinal transit time, with intensity of infection, and perhaps with the strain of parasite. The drug kills hookworm, ascaris, and trichuris eggs.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

In the USA, mebendazole has been approved for use in ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hookworm and pinworm infection. It can be taken before or after meals; the tablets should be chewed before swallowing. For pinworm infection, the dose is 100 mg once, repeated at 2 weeks. For ascariasis, trichuriasis, hookworm, and trichostrongylus infections, a dosage of 100 mg twice daily for 3 days is used for adults and for children older than 2 years of age. Cure rates are 90-100\% for pinworm infections, ascariasis, and trichuriasis. Cure rates are lower for hookworm infections, but a marked reduction in the worm burden occurs in those not cured. For intestinal capillariasis, mebendazole is used at a dosage of $400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ in divided doses for 21 or more days. In trichinosis, limited reports suggest efficacy against adult worms in the intestinal tract and tissue larvae. Treatment is three times daily, with fatty foods, at 200-400 mg per dose for 3 days and then $400-500 \mathrm{mg}$ per dose for 10 days. Corticosteroids should be coadministered for severe infections.

\section*{Adverse Reactions, Contraindications, \& Cautions}

Short-term mebendazole therapy for intestinal nematodes is nearly free of adverse effects. Mild nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain have been reported infrequently. Rare side effects, usually with high-dose therapy, are hypersensitivity reactions (rash, urticaria), agranulocytosis, alopecia, and elevation of liver enzymes.

Mebendazole is teratogenic in animals and therefore contraindicated in pregnancy. It should be used with caution in children younger than 2 years of age because of limited experience and rare reports of convulsions in this age group. Plasma levels may be decreased by concomitant use of carbamazepine or phenytoin and increased by cimetidine. Mebendazole should be used with caution in patients with cirrhosis.

\section*{METRI FONATE (TRI CHLORFON)}

Metrifonate is a safe, low-cost alternative drug for the treatment of Schistosoma haematobium infections. It is not active against S mansoni or S japonicum. It is not available in the USA.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Metrifonate, an organophosphate compound, is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Following the standard oral dose, peak blood levels are reached in 1-2 hours; the half-life is about 1.5 hours. Clearance appears to be through nonenzymatic transformation to dichlorvos, its active metabolite. Metrifonate and dichlorvos are well distributed to the tissues and are completely eliminated in 24-48 hours.

\section*{Anthelmintic Actions}

The mode of action is thought to be related to cholinesterase inhibition. This inhibition temporarily paralyzes the adult worms, resulting in their shift from the bladder venous plexus to small arterioles of the lungs, where they are trapped, encased by the immune system, and die. The drug is not effective against $S$ haematobium eggs; live eggs continue to pass in the urine for several months after all adult worms have been killed.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

In the treatment of $S$ haematobium, a single oral dose of $7.5-10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ is given three times at 14day intervals. Cure rates on this schedule are 44-93\%, with marked reductions in egg counts in those not cured. Metrifonate was also effective as a prophylactic agent when given monthly to children in a highly endemic area, and it has been used in mass treatment programs. In mixed infections with S haematobium and S mansoni, metrifonate has been successfully combined with oxamniquine.

\section*{Adverse Reactions, Contraindications, \& Cautions}

Some studies note mild and transient cholinergic symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, bronchospasm, headache, sweating, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and vertigo. These symptoms may begin within 30 minutes and persist up to 12 hours.

Metrifonate should not be used after recent exposure to insecticides or drugs that might potentiate cholinesterase inhibition. Metrifonate is contraindicated in pregnancy.

\section*{NI CLOSAMI DE}

Niclosamide is a second-line drug for the treatment of most tapeworm infections, but it is not available in the USA.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Niclosamide is a salicylamide derivative. It appears to be minimally absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tractâneither the drug nor its metabolites have been recovered from the blood or urine.
<smiles>O=C(Nc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1Cl)c1cc(Cl)ccc1O</smiles>

Niclosamide

\section*{Anthelmintic Actions}

Adult worms (but not ova) are rapidly killed, presumably due to inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation or stimulation of ATPase activity.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

The adult dose of niclosamide is 2 g once, given in the morning on an empty stomach. The tablets must be chewed thoroughly and are then swallowed with water.

TAENIA SAGI NATA (BEEF TAPEWORM), T SOLIUM (PORK TAPEWORM), AND DIPHYLLOBOTHRIUM LATUM (FISH TAPEWORM)
A single 2 g dose of niclosamide results in cure rates of over 85\% for D latum and about 95\% for T saginata. It is probably equally effective against T solium. Cysticercosis is theoretically possible after treatment of T solium infections, because viable ova are released into the gut lumen following digestion of segments. However, no such cases of cysticercosis following therapy have been reported.

\section*{OTHER TAPEWORMS}

Most patients treated with niclosamide for H diminuta and Dipylidium caninum infections are cured with a 7-day course of treatment; a few require a second course. Praziquantel is superior for Hymenolepis nana (dwarf tapeworm) infection. Niclosamide is not effective against cysticercosis or hydatid disease.

\section*{I NTESTI NAL FLUKE I NFECTIONS}

Niclosamide can be used as an alternative drug in the treatment of Fasciolopsis buski, Heterophyes heterophyes, and Metagonimus yokogawai infections. The standard dose is given every other day for three doses.

\section*{Adverse Reactions, Contraindications, \& Cautions}

Infrequent, mild, and transitory adverse events include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort.

The consumption of alcohol should be avoided on the day of treatment and for 1 day afterward.
The safety of the drug has not been established in pregnancy or for children younger than 2 years of age.

\section*{OXAMNIQUINE}

Oxamniquine is an alternative to praziquantel for the treatment of S mansoni infections. It has also been used extensively for mass treatment. It is not effective against S haematobium or S japonicum.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Oxamniquine, a semisynthetic tetrahydroquinoline, is readily absorbed orally. Its plasma half-life is about 2.5 hours. The drug is extensively metabolized to inactive metabolites and excreted in the urine-up to $75 \%$ in the first 24 hours. Intersubject variations in serum concentration have been noted, which may explain some treatment failures.

\section*{Anthelmintic Actions}

Oxamniquine is active against both mature and immature stages of S mansoni but does not appear to be cercaricidal. The mechanism of action is unknown. Contraction and paralysis of the worms results in detachment from terminal venules in the mesentery and transit to the liver, where many die; surviving females return to the mesenteric vessels but cease to lay eggs.

Strains of S mansoni in different parts of the world vary in susceptibility. Oxamniquine has been effective in instances of praziquantel resistance.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Oxamniquine is safe and effective in all stages of S mansoni disease, including advanced hepatosplenomegaly. In the acute (Katayama) syndrome, treatment results in disappearance of acute symptoms and clearance of the infection. The drug is generally less effective in children, who require higher doses than adults. It is better-tolerated with food.

Optimal dosage schedules vary for different regions of the world. In the Western Hemisphere and western Africa, the adult oxamniquine dosage is $12-15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ given once. In northern and southern Africa, standard schedules are $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ twice daily for 2 days. In eastern Africa and the Arabian peninsula, standard dosage is $15-20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ twice in 1 day. Cure rates are $70-95 \%$, with marked reduction in egg excretion in those not cured.

In mixed schistosome infections, oxamniquine has been successfully used in combination with metrifonate.

\section*{Adverse Reactions, Contraindications, \& Cautions}

Mild symptoms, starting about 3 hours after a dose and lasting for several hours, occur in more than one third of patients. Central nervous system symptoms (dizziness, headache, drowsiness) are most common; nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, colic, pruritus, and urticaria also occur. Infrequent adverse effects are low-grade fever, an orange to red discoloration of the urine, proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and a transient decrease in leukocytes. Seizures have been reported rarely.

Since the drug makes many patients dizzy or drowsy, it should be used with caution in patients whose work or activity requires mental alertness (eg, no driving for 24 hours). It should be used with caution in those with a history of epilepsy.

Oxamniquine is contraindicated in pregnancy.

\section*{PI PERAZI NE}

Piperazine is an alternative for the treatment of ascariasis, with cure rates over $90 \%$ when taken for 2 days, but it is not recommended for other helminth infections. Piperazine is available as the hexahydrate and as a variety of salts. It is readily absorbed, and maximum plasma levels are reached in 2-4 hours. Most of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine in 2-6 hours, and excretion is complete within 24 hours.

Piperazine causes paralysis of ascaris by blocking acetylcholine at the myoneural junction; unable to maintain their position in the host, live worms are expelled by normal peristalsis.

For ascariasis, the dosage of piperazine (as the hexahydrate) is $75 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ (maximum dose, 3.5 g ) orally once daily for 2 days. For heavy infections, treatment should be continued for 3-4 days or repeated after 1 week.

Occasional mild adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness, and headache. Neurotoxicity and allergic reactions are rare.

Piperazine compounds should not be given to women during pregnancy, to patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, or to those with a history of epilepsy or chronic neurologic disease.

\section*{PRAZI QUANTEL}

Praziquantel is effective in the treatment of schistosome infections of all species and most other trematode and cestode infections, including cysticercosis. The drug's safety and effectiveness as a single oral dose have also made it useful in mass treatment of several infections.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Praziquantel is a synthetic isoquinoline-pyrazine derivative. It is rapidly absorbed, with a bioavailability of about $80 \%$ after oral administration. Peak serum concentrations are reached 1-3 hours after a therapeutic dose. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of praziquantel reach 14-20\% of the drug's plasma concentration. About $80 \%$ of the drug is bound to plasma proteins. Most of the drug is rapidly metabolized to inactive mono- and polyhydroxylated products after a first pass in the liver. The half-life is 0.8-1.5 hours. Excretion is mainly via the kidneys (60-80\%) and bile (15-35\%). Plasma concentrations of praziquantel increase when the drug is taken with a high-carbohydrate meal or with cimetidine; bioavailability is markedly reduced with some antiepileptics (phenytoin, carbamazepine) or with corticosteroids.

\section*{Anthelmintic Actions}

Praziquantel appears to increase the permeability of trematode and cestode cell membranes to calcium, resulting in paralysis, dislodgement, and death.

In schistosome infections of experimental animals, praziquantel is effective against adult worms and immature stages and it has a prophylactic effect against cercarial infection.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Praziquantel tablets are taken with liquid after a meal; they should be swallowed without chewing because their bitter taste can induce retching and vomiting.

\section*{SCHISTOSOMI ASIS}

Praziquantel is the drug of choice for all forms of schistosomiasis. The dosage is $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ for two ( S mansoni and S haematobium) or three ( S japonicum and S mekongi) doses at intervals of 4-6 hours. High cure rates ( $75-95 \%$ ) are achieved when patients are evaluated at $3-6$ months; there is marked reduction in egg counts in those not cured. The drug is effective in adults and children and is generally well tolerated by patients in the hepatosplenic stage of advanced disease. It is not clear, however, whether the drug can be safely or effectively used during the acute stage of the disease (Katayama fever) because release of antigens from dying immature worms may exacerbate symptoms. Increasing evidence indicates rare $S$ mansoni drug resistance, which is treatable with oxamniquine. Effectiveness of the drug for chemoprophylaxis has not been established.

\section*{CLONORCHIASIS, OPISTHORCHIASIS, AND PARAGONIMIASIS}

The dosage of $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ three times for 1 day results in nearly 100\% cure rates for clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis, and a 2 day course provides $90-100 \%$ cure rates for pulmonary paragonimiasis.

\section*{TAENIASIS AND DIPHYLLOBOTHRIASIS}

A single dose of praziquantel, $5-10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, results in nearly $100 \%$ cure rates for T saginata, T solium, and D latum infections. Because praziquantel does not kill eggs, it is theoretically possible that larvae of T solium released from eggs in the large bowel could penetrate the intestinal wall and give rise to cysticercosis, but this hazard is probably minimal.

\section*{NEUROCYSTI CERCOSIS}

Albendazole is now the preferred drug, but when it is not appropriate or available, praziquantel has similar efficacy. Indications are similar to those for albendazole. The praziquantel dosage is 50 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in three divided doses for 14 days or longer. Clinical responses to therapy vary from dramatic improvements of seizures and other neurologic findings to no response and even progression of the disease. Praziquantelâbut not albendazoleâhas diminished bioavailability when taken concurrently with a corticosteroid. Recommendations on corticosteroid use in neurocysticercosis vary.

\section*{H NANA}

Praziquantel is the drug of choice for H nana infections and the first drug to be highly effective. A single dose of $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ is taken initially and repeated in 1 week.

\section*{HYDATID DISEASE}

In hydatid disease, praziquantel kills protoscoleces but does not affect the germinal membrane. Praziquantel is being evaluated as an adjunct with albendazole pre- and postsurgery. In addition to its direct action, praziquantel enhances the plasma concentration of albendazole sulfoxide.

\section*{OTHER PARASITES}

Limited trials at a dosage of $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ three times a day for 1-2 days indicate effectiveness of praziquantel against fasciolopsiasis, metagonimiasis, and other forms of heterophyiasis. Praziquantel was not effective for fascioliasis, however, even at dosages as high as $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ three times daily for 3-7 days.

\section*{Adverse Reactions, Contraindications, \& Cautions}

Mild and transient adverse effects are common. They begin within several hours after ingestion and may persist for hours to 1 day. Most frequent are headache, dizziness, drowsiness, and lassitude;
others include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loose stools, pruritus, urticaria, arthralgia, myalgia, and low-grade fever. Mild and transient elevations of liver enzymes have been reported. Several days after starting praziquantel, low-grade fever, pruritus, and skin rashes (macular and urticarial), sometimes associated with worsened eosinophilia, may occur, probably due to the release of proteins from dying worms rather than direct drug toxicity. The intensity and frequency of adverse effects increase with dosage such that they occur in up to $50 \%$ of patients who receive $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ three times in 1 day.

In neurocysticercosis, neurologic abnormalities may be exacerbated by inflammatory reactions around dying parasites. Common findings in patients who do not receive corticosteroids, usually presenting during or shortly after therapy, are headache, meningismus, nausea, vomiting, mental changes, and seizures (often accompanied by increased cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis). More serious findings, including arachnoiditis, hyperthermia, and intracranial hypertension, may also occur. Corticosteroids are commonly used with praziquantel in the treatment of neurocysticercosis to decrease the inflammatory reaction, but this is controversial, and complicated by knowledge that corticosteroids decrease the plasma level of praziquantel up to $50 \%$. Praziquantel is contraindicated in ocular cysticercosis, as parasite destruction in the eye may cause irreparable damage. Some workers also caution against use of the drug in spinal neurocysticercosis.

The safety of praziquantel in children younger than age 4 years is not established, but no specific problems in young children have been documented. Indeed, the drug appears to be better tolerated in children than in adults. Praziquantel increased abortion rates in rats and therefore should be avoided in pregnancy if possible. Because the drug induces dizziness and drowsiness, patients should not drive during therapy and should be warned regarding activities requiring particular physical coordination or alertness.

\section*{PYRANTEL PAMOATE}

Pyrantel pamoate is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic highly effective for the treatment of pinworm, ascaris, and Trichostrongylus orientalis infections. It is moderately effective against both species of hookworm. It is not effective in trichuriasis or strongyloidiasis. Oxantel pamoate, an analog of pyrantel not available in the USA, has been used successfully in the treatment of trichuriasis; the two drugs have been combined for their broad-spectrum anthelmintic activity.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Pyrantel pamoate is a tetrahydropyrimidine derivative. It is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and active mainly against luminal organisms. Peak plasma levels are reached in 1-3 hours. Over half of the administered dose is recovered unchanged in the feces.

\section*{Anthelmintic Actions}

Pyrantel is effective against mature and immature forms of susceptible helminths within the intestinal tract but not against migratory stages in the tissues or against ova. The drug is a neuromuscular blocking agent that causes release of acetylcholine and inhibition of cholinesterase; this results in paralysis, which is followed by expulsion of worms.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

The standard dose is 11 mg (base)/kg (maximum, 1 g ), given orally once with or without food. For pinworm the dose is repeated in 2 weeks, and cure rates are greater than $95 \%$. The drug is available in the USA without prescription for this indication.

For ascariasis, a single dose yields cure rates of $85-100 \%$. Treatment should be repeated if eggs are found 2 weeks after treatment. For hookworm infections, a single dose is effective against light infections; but for heavy infections, especially with N americanus, a 3 -day course is necessary to reach $90 \%$ cure rates. A course of treatment can be repeated in 2 weeks.

\section*{Adverse Reactions, Contraindications, \& Cautions}

Adverse effects are infrequent, mild, and transient. They include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, insomnia, rash, fever, and weakness. Pyrantel should be used with caution in patients with liver dysfunction, because low, transient aminotransferase elevations have been noted in a small number of patients. Experience with the drug in pregnant women and children younger than 2 years of age is limited.

\section*{THI ABENDAZOLE}

Thiabendazole is an alternative to ivermectin for the treatment of strongyloidiasis and cutaneous larva migrans.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Thiabendazole is a benzimidazole compound. Although it is a chelating agent that forms stable complexes with a number of metals, including iron, it does not bind calcium.

Thiabendazole is rapidly absorbed after ingestion. With a standard dose, drug concentrations in plasma peak within 1-2 hours; the half-life is 1.2 hours. The drug is almost completely metabolized in the liver to the 5-hydroxy form; $90 \%$ is excreted in the urine in 48 hours, largely as the glucuronide or sulfonate conjugate. Thiabendazole can also be absorbed from the skin.

\section*{Anthelmintic Actions}

The mechanism of action of thiabendazole is probably the same as that of other benzimidazoles (see above). The drug has ovicidal effects for some parasites.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

The standard dosage, $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ (maximum, 1.5 g ) twice daily, should be given after meals. Tablets should be chewed. For strongyloides infection, treatment is for 2 days. Cure rates are reportedly $93 \%$. A course can be repeated in 1 week if indicated. In patients with hyperinfection syndrome, the standard dose is continued twice daily for 5-7 days. For cutaneous larva migrans, thiabendazole cream can be applied topically or the oral drug can be given for 2 days (although albendazole is less toxic and therefore preferred).

\section*{Adverse Reactions, Contraindications, \& Cautions}

Thiabendazole is much more toxic than other benzimidazoles or ivermectin, so other agents are now preferred for most indications. Common adverse effects include dizziness, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Less frequent problems are epigastric pain, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, pruritus, headache, drowsiness, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Irreversible liver failure and fatal Stevens-

Johnson syndrome have been reported.
Experience with thiabendazole is limited in children weighing less than 15 kg . The drug should not be used in pregnancy or in the presence of hepatic or renal disease.
