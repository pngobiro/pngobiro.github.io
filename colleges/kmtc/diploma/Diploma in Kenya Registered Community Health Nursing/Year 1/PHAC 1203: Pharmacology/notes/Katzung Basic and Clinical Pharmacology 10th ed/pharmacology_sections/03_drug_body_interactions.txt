\section*{Pharmacodynamic Principles}

Most drugs must bind to a receptor to bring about an effect. However, at the molecular level, drug binding is only the first in what is often a complex sequence of steps.

\section*{TYPES OF DRUG-RECEPTOR INTERACTIONS}

Agonist drugs bind to and activate the receptor in some fashion, which directly or indirectly brings about the effect. Some receptors incorporate effector machinery in the same molecule, so that drug binding brings about the effect directly, eg, opening of an ion channel or activation of enzyme activity. Other receptors are linked through one or more intervening coupling molecules to a separate effector molecule. The five major types of drug-receptor-effector coupling systems are discussed in Chapter 2. Pharmacologic antagonist drugs, by binding to a receptor, prevent binding by other molecules. For example, acetylcholine receptor blockers such as atropine are antagonists because they prevent access of acetylcholine and similar agonist drugs to the acetylcholine receptor and they stabilize the receptor in its inactive state. These agents reduce the effects of acetylcholine and similar molecules in the body.

\section*{AGONISTS THAT INHIBIT THEIR BINDING MOLECULES AND PARTIAL AGONISTS}

Some drugs mimic agonist drugs by inhibiting the molecules responsible for terminating the action of an endogenous agonist. For example, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, by slowing the destruction of endogenous acetylcholine, cause cholinomimetic effects that closely resemble the actions of cholinoceptor agonist molecules even though cholinesterase inhibitors do not bind or only incidentally bind to cholinoceptors (see Chapter 7, Cholinoceptor-Activating \& Cholinesterase-Inhibiting Drugs). Other drugs bind to receptors and activate them but do not evoke as great a response as so-called full agonists. Thus, pindolol, a Badrenoceptor "partial agonist," may act as either an agonist (if no full agonist is present) or as an antagonist (if a full agonist such as epinephrine is present). (See Chapter 2.)

\section*{DURATION OF DRUG ACTION}

Termination of drug action at the receptor level results from one of several processes. In some cases, the effect lasts only as long as the drug occupies the receptor, so that dissociation of drug from the receptor automatically terminates the effect. In many cases, however, the action may persist after the drug has dissociated, because, for example, some coupling molecule is still present in activated form. In
the case of drugs that bind covalently to the receptor site, the effect may persist until the drug-receptor complex is destroyed and new receptors or enzymes are synthesized, as described previously for aspirin. Finally, many receptor-effector systems incorporate desensitization mechanisms for preventing excessive activation when agonist molecules continue to be present for long periods. See Chapter 2 for additional details.

\section*{RECEPTORS AND INERT BINDING SITES}

To function as a receptor, an endogenous molecule must first be selective in choosing ligands (drug molecules) to bind; and second, it must change its function upon binding in such a way that the function of the biologic system (cell, tissue, etc) is altered. The first characteristic is required to avoid constant activation of the receptor by promiscuous binding of many different ligands. The second characteristic is clearly necessary if the ligand is to cause a pharmacologic effect. The body contains many molecules that are capable of binding drugs, however, and not all of these endogenous molecules are regulatory molecules. Binding of a drug to a nonregulatory molecule such as plasma albumin will result in no detectable change in the function of the biologic system, so this endogenous molecule can be called an inert binding site. Such binding is not completely without significance, however, because it affects the distribution of drug within the body and determines the amount of free drug in the circulation. Both of these factors are of pharmacokinetic importance (see below and Chapter 3).

\section*{Pharmacokinetic Principles}

In practical therapeutics, a drug should be able to reach its intended site of action after administration by some convenient route. In some cases, a chemical that is readily absorbed and distributed is administered and then converted to the active drug by biologic processes-inside the body. Such a chemical is called a prodrug.

In only a few situations is it possible to directly apply a drug to its target tissue, eg, by topical application of an anti-inflammatory agent to inflamed skin or mucous membrane. Most often, a drug is administered into one body compartment, eg, the gut, and must move to its site of action in another compartment, eg, the brain. This requires that the drug be absorbed into the blood from its site of administration and distributed to its site of action, permeating through the various barriers that separate these compartments. For a drug given orally to produce an effect in the central nervous system, these barriers include the tissues that make up the wall of the intestine, the walls of the capillaries that perfuse the gut, and the "blood-brain barrier," the walls of the capillaries that perfuse the brain. Finally, after bringing about its effect, a drug should be eliminated at a reasonable rate by metabolic inactivation, by excretion from the body, or by a combination of these processes.

\section*{PERMEATION}

Drug permeation proceeds by several mechanisms. Passive diffusion in an aqueous or lipid medium is common, but active processes play a role in the movement of many drugs, especially those whose molecules are too large to diffuse readily.

\section*{Aqueous Diffusion}

Aqueous diffusion occurs within the larger aqueous compartments of the body (interstitial space, cytosol, etc) and across epithelial membrane tight junctions and the endothelial lining of blood vessels through aqueous pores that-in some tissues-permit the passage of molecules as large as MW 20,000-30,000.*

Aqueous diffusion of drug molecules is usually driven by the concentration gradient of the permeating drug, a downhill movement described by Fick's law (see below). Drug molecules that are bound to large plasma proteins (eg, albumin) do not permeate most vascular aqueous pores. If the drug is charged, its flux is also influenced by electrical fields (eg, the membrane potential and-in parts of the nephron-the transtubular potential).
*The capillaries of the brain, the testes, and some other tissues are characterized by the absence of pores that permit aqueous diffusion. They may also contain high concentrations of drug export pumps (MDR pumps; see text). These tissues are therefore protected or "sanctuary" sites from many circulating drugs.

\section*{Lipid Diffusion}

Lipid diffusion is the most important limiting factor for drug permeation because of the large number of lipid barriers that separate the compartments of the body. Because these lipid barriers separate aqueous compartments, the lipid:aqueous partition coefficient of a drug determines how readily the molecule moves between aqueous and lipid media. In the case of weak acids and weak bases (which gain or lose electrical charge-bearing protons, depending on the pH ), the ability to move from aqueous to lipid or vice versa varies with the pH of the medium, because charged molecules attract water molecules. The ratio of lipid-soluble form to water-soluble form for a weak acid or weak base is expressed by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (see below).

\section*{Special Carriers}

Special carrier molecules exist for certain substances that are important for cell function and too large or too insoluble in lipid to diffuse passively through membranes, eg, peptides, amino acids, glucose. These carriers bring about movement by active transport or facilitated diffusion and, unlike passive diffusion, are saturable and inhibitable. Because many drugs are or resemble such naturally occurring peptides, amino acids, or sugars, they can use these carriers to cross membranes.

Many cells also contain less selective membrane carriers that are specialized for expelling foreign molecules. One large family of such transporters bind adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and is called the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) family. This family includes the P-glycoprotein or multidrug-resistance type 1 (MDR1) transporter found in the brain, testes, and other tissues, and in some drug-resistant neoplastic cells. Similar transport molecules from the ABC family, the multidrug resistanceassociated protein (MRP1 through MRP5) transporters, play important roles in excretion of some drugs or their metabolites into urine and bile and in resistance of some tumors to chemotherapeutic drugs. Several other transporter families have been identified that do not bind ATP but use ion gradients for transport energy. Some of these are particularly important in the uptake of neurotransmitters across nerve ending membranes.

\section*{Endocytosis and Exocytosis}

A few substances are so large or impermeant that they can enter cells only by endocytosis, the process by which the substance is engulfed by the cell membrane and carried into the cell by pinching off of the newly formed vesicle inside the membrane. The substance can then be released inside the cytosol by breakdown of the vesicle membrane. This process is responsible for the transport of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, complexed with a binding protein (intrinsic factor) across the wall of the gut into the blood. Similarly, iron is transported into hemoglobin-synthesizing red blood cell precursors in association with the protein transferrin. Specific receptors for the transport proteins must be present for this process to work.

The reverse process (exocytosis) is responsible for the secretion of many substances from cells. For example, many neurotransmitter substances are stored in membrane-bound vesicles in nerve endings to protect them from metabolic destruction in the cytoplasm. Appropriate activation of the nerve ending causes fusion of the storage vesicle with the cell membrane and expulsion of its contents into the extracellular space (see Chapter 6).

\section*{FICK'S LAW OF DIFFUSION}

The passive flux of molecules down a concentration gradient is given by Fick's law:
Flux (molecules per unit time) $=$
$$\left(C_{1}-C_{2}\right) \times \frac{\text { Area } \times \text { Permeability coefficient }}{\text { Thickness }}$$
where $\mathrm{C}_{1}$ is the higher concentration, $\mathrm{C}_{2}$ is the lower concentration, area is the area across which diffusion is occurring, permeability coefficient is a measure of the mobility of the drug molecules in the medium of the diffusion path, and thickness is the thickness (length) of the diffusion path. In the case of lipid diffusion, the lipid: aqueous partition coefficient is a major determinant of mobility of the drug, because it determines how readily the drug enters the lipid membrane from the aqueous medium.

\section*{IONIZATION OF WEAK ACIDS AND WEAK BASES; THE HENDERSON-HASSELBALCH EQUATION}

The electrostatic charge of an ionized molecule attracts water dipoles and results in a polar, relatively water-soluble and lipid-insoluble complex. Because lipid diffusion depends on relatively high lipid solubility, ionization of drugs may markedly reduce their ability to permeate membranes. A very large fraction of the drugs in use are weak acids or weak bases (Table 1-2). For drugs, a weak acid is best defined as a neutral molecule that can reversibly dissociate into an anion (a negatively charged molecule) and a proton (a hydrogen ion). For example, aspirin dissociates as follows:
$\mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{7} \mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{COOH} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{7} \mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{COO}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$
