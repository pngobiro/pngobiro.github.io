\section*{ANTI PSYCHOTI C AGENTS}

The terms antipsychotic and neuroleptic have been used interchangeably to denote a group of drugs that have been used mainly for treating schizophrenia but are also effective in some other psychoses and agitated states.

\section*{History}

Antipsychotic drugs have been used in Western medicine for more than 50 years. Reserpine and chlorpromazine were the first drugs found to be useful in schizophrenia. Although chlorpromazine is still sometimes used for the treatment of psychoses, these forerunner drugs have been superseded by many newer agents. Their impact on psychiatry, however-especially on the treatment of schizophrenia-has been enormous: The number of patients hospitalized in mental institutions has markedly decreased, and schizophrenia is now recognized as a biologic illness.

\section*{Nature of Psychosis \& Schizophrenia}

The term "psychosis" denotes a variety of mental disorders. Schizophrenia is a particular kind of psychosis characterized mainly by a clear sensorium but a marked thinking disturbance.

The pathogenesis of schizophrenia is unknown. Largely as a result of research stimulated by the discovery of antipsychotic drugs, a genetic predisposition has been proposed as a necessary but not always sufficient condition underlying psychotic disorder. This assumption has been supported by the observed familial incidence of schizophrenia. At least one gene-that encoding neuregulin 1-is associated with schizophrenia in Icelandic and northern European populations. Additional genes associated with schizophrenia continue to be identified that may contribute to understanding the molecular basis for schizophrenia. Based on the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs, efforts continue to link the disorder with abnormalities of amine neurotransmitter function, especially that of dopamine (see The Dopamine Hypothesis of Schizophrenia). The defects of this hypothesis are significant, and it is now appreciated that schizophrenia is far more complex than originally supposed.

\section*{THE DOPAMINE HYPOTHESIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA}

The dopamine hypothesis for schizophrenia is the most fully developed of several hypotheses and is the basis for much of the rationale for drug therapy. Several lines of circumstantial evidence suggest that excessive dopaminergic activity plays a role in the disorder: (1) many antipsychotic drugs strongly block postsynaptic $D_{2}$ receptors in the central nervous system, especially in the mesolimbic-frontal system; (2) drugs that increase dopaminergic activity, such as levodopa (a precursor), amphetamines (releasers of dopamine), and apomorphine (a direct dopamine receptor agonist), either aggravate schizophrenia or produce psychosis de novo in some patients; (3) dopamine receptor density has been found postmortem to be increased in the brains of schizophrenics who have not been treated with antipsychotic drugs; (4) positron emission tomography (PET) has shown increased dopamine receptor density in both treated and untreated schizophrenics when compared with such scans of nonschizophrenic persons; and (5) successful treatment of schizophrenic patients has been reported to change the amount of homovanillic acid (HVA), a metabolite of dopamine, in the cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, and urine.

The dopamine hypothesis is far from complete, however. If an abnormality of dopamine physiology were completely responsible for the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, antipsychotic drugs would do a much better
job of treating patients-but they are only partially effective for most and ineffective for some patients. Moreover, it appears that antagonists of the NMDA receptor such as phencyclidine, when administered to nonpsychotic subjects, produce much more "schizophrenia-like" symptoms than do dopamine agonists. The cloning and characterization of multiple dopamine receptor types may permit more direct testing of the dopamine hypothesis if drugs can be developed that act more selectively on each receptor type. The traditional antipsychotics bind $D_{2} 50$ times more avidly than $D_{1}$ or $D_{3}$ receptors. Until recently, the main thrust in drug development was to find agents that were more potent and more selective in blocking $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ receptors. The fact that several of the atypical antipsychotic drugs have much less effect on $D_{2}$ receptors and yet are effective in schizophrenia has redirected attention to the role of other dopamine receptors and to nondopamine receptors, especially serotonin receptor subtypes that may mediate synergistic effects or protect against the extrapyramidal consequences of $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ antagonism. As a result of these considerations, the direction of research has changed to a greater focus on compounds that may act on several transmitterreceptor systems. The great hope is to produce drugs with greater efficacy and fewer adverse effects, especially extrapyramidal toxicity.

\section*{Chemical Types}

A number of chemical structures have been associated with antipsychotic properties. The drugs can be classified into several groups as shown in Figures 29-1 and 29-2.

\section*{PHENOTHI AZI NE DERI VATI VES}

Three subfamilies of phenothiazines, based primarily on the side chain of the molecule, were once the most widely used of the antipsychotics. Aliphatic derivatives (eg, chlorpromazine ) and piperidine derivatives (eg, thioridazine ) are the least potent. Piperazine derivatives are more potent (effective in lower doses) but not necessarily more efficacious. The piperazine derivatives are also more selective in their pharmacologic effects (Table 29-1).

\section*{THI OXANTHENE DERIVATIVES}

This group of drugs is exemplified primarily by thiothixene. In general, these compounds are slightly less potent than their phenothiazine analogs.

\section*{BUTYROPHENONE DERIVATIVES}

This group, of which haloperidol is the most widely used, has a very different structure from those of the two preceding groups. Diphenylbutylpiperidines are closely related compounds. The butyrophenones and congeners tend to be more potent and to have fewer autonomic effects but greater extrapyramidal effects (Table 29-1).

\section*{MISCELLANEOUS STRUCTURES}

The newer drugs, not all of which are available in the USA, have a variety of structures and include pimozide, molindone, loxapine, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole (Figure 29-2).

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

\section*{ABSORPTION AND DISTRIBUTION}

Most antipsychotic drugs are readily but incompletely absorbed. Furthermore, many of these drugs undergo significant first-pass metabolism. Thus, oral doses of chlorpromazine and thioridazine have systemic availability of $25 \%$ to $35 \%$, whereas haloperidol, which is less likely to be metabolized, has an average systemic availability of about 65\%.

Most antipsychotic drugs are highly lipid-soluble and protein-bound (92-99\%). They tend to have large volumes of distribution (usually $>7 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{kg}$ ). Probably because these drugs are sequestered in lipid compartments of the body and have a very high affinity for selected neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system, they generally have a much longer clinical duration of action than would be estimated from their plasma half-lives. This is paralleled by prolonged occupancy of dopamine $D_{2}$ receptors in brain. Metabolites of chlorpromazine may be excreted in the urine weeks after the last dose of chronically administered drug. Similarly, full relapse may not occur until 6 weeks or more after discontinuation of many antipsychotic drugs.

\section*{METABOLISM}

Most antipsychotic drugs are almost completely metabolized by a variety of processes. Although some metabolites retain activity, eg, 7-hydroxychlorpromazine and reduced haloperidol, metabolites are not considered to be highly important to the action of these drugs. The sole exception is mesoridazine, the major metabolite of thioridazine, which is more potent than the parent compound and accounts for most of the effect. This compound has been marketed as a separate entity. Very little of these antipsychotic drugs is excreted unchanged, because they are almost completely metabolized to more polar substances.

\section*{Pharmacologic Effects}

The first phenothiazine antipsychotic drugs, with chlorpromazine as the prototype, proved to have a wide variety of central nervous system, autonomic, and endocrine effects. These actions were traced to blocking effects at a wide range of receptors, including dopamine and cadrenoceptor, muscarinic, $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ histaminic, and serotonin ( $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ ) receptors. Dopamine receptor effects quickly became the major focus of interest.

\section*{DOPAMI NERGIC SYSTEMS}

Five important dopaminergic systems or pathways are now recognized in the brain. The first pathway-the one most closely related to behavior-is the mesolimbic-mesocortical pathway, which projects from cell bodies near the substantia nigra to the limbic system and neocortex. The second system-the nigrostriatal pathway-consists of neurons that project from the substantia nigra to the caudate and putamen; it is involved in the coordination of voluntary movement. The third pathway-the tuberoinfundibular system-connects arcuate nuclei and periventricular neurons to the hypothalamus and posterior pituitary. Dopamine released by these neurons physiologically inhibits prolactin secretion. The fourth dopaminergic system-the medullary-periventricular pathway-consists of neurons in the motor nucleus of the vagus whose projections are not well defined. This system may be involved in eating behavior. The fifth pathway-the incertohypothalamic pathway-forms connections from the medial zona incerta to the hypothalamus and the amygdala. It appears to regulate the anticipatory motivational phase of copulatory behavior in rats.

After dopamine was recognized as a neurotransmitter in 1959, investigators showed that its effects on electrical activity in central synapses and on production of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase could be blocked by most antipsychotic drugs. This evidence led to the conclusion in the early 1960s that these drugs should be considered dopamine antagonists. The antipsychotic action is now thought to be produced (at least in part) by their ability to block dopamine in the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems. Furthermore, the antagonism of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system explains the unwanted effect of parkinsonism produced by these drugs. The hyperprolactinemia that follows treatment with antipsychotics is caused by blockade of dopamine's tonic inhibitory effect on prolactin release from the pituitary. Thus, the same pharmacodynamic action may have distinct psychiatric, neurologic, and endocrinologic consequences.

\section*{DOPAMINE RECEPTORS AND THEIR EFFECTS}

At present, five dopamine receptors have been described, consisting of two separate families, the $D_{1}$-like and $D_{2}$-like receptor groups. The $D_{1}$ receptor is coded by a gene on chromosome 5, increases cAMP by $G_{s}$ coupled activation of adenylyl cyclase, and is located mainly in the putamen, nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercle. The second member of this family, $\mathrm{D}_{5}$, is coded by a gene on chromosome 4, also increases CAMP, and is found in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. The therapeutic potency of antipsychotic drugs does not correlate with their affinity for binding the $\mathrm{D}_{1}$ receptor (Figure 29-3, top) but for most, correlates strongly with $D_{2}$ affinity. The $D_{2}$ receptor is coded on chromosome 11, decreases cAMP (by $\mathrm{G}_{i}$-coupled inhibition of adenylyl cyclase), and inhibits calcium channels but opens potassium channels. It is found both pre- and postsynaptically on neurons in the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercle. A second member of this family, the $D_{3}$ receptor, also coded by a gene on chromosome 11, is thought to decrease cAMP and is located in the frontal cortex, medulla, and midbrain. $\mathrm{D}_{4}$ receptors also decrease cAMP.
Figure 29-3.

Correlations between the therapeutic potency of antipsychotic drugs and their affinity for binding to dopamine $D_{1}$ (top) or $D_{2}$ receptors (bottom) . Potency is indicated on the horizontal axes; it decreases to the right. Binding affinity for $D_{1}$ receptors was measured by displacing the selective $D_{1}$ ligand SCH 23390; affinity for $D_{2}$ receptors was similarly measured by displacing the selective $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ ligand haloperidol. Binding affinity decreases upward. (Modified and reproduced, with permission, from Seeman P: Dopamine receptors and the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. Synapse 1987; 1: 133.)

The activation of $D_{2}$ receptors by a variety of direct or indirect agonists (eg, amphetamines, levodopa, apomorphine) causes increased motor activity and stereotyped behavior in rats, a model that has been extensively used for antipsychotic drug screening. When given to humans, the same drugs aggravate schizophrenia. The antipsychotic agents block $D_{2}$ receptors stereoselectively for the most part, and their binding affinity is very strongly correlated with clinical antipsychotic and extrapyramidal potency (Figure

29-3, bottom). Continuous treatment with antipsychotic drugs has been reported in some studies to produce a transient increase in levels of a dopamine metabolite, homovanillic acid (HVA), in the cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, and urine.

These findings have been incorporated into the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. However, many questions have not been satisfactorily answered, and many observations have not been fully confirmed. For example, dopamine receptors exist in both high- and low-affinity forms, and it is not known whether schizophrenia or the antipsychotic drugs alter the proportions of receptors in these two forms. With the introduction of aripiprazole, which in preclinical studies shows partial agonism at $D_{2}$ and $5-\mathrm{HT}_{1 \mathrm{~A}}$ receptors, the relevance of the proportion of receptors in various affinity states may prove especially important for understanding the degree of response to this agent.

Furthermore, the drug-induced progression of extrapyramidal changes-from diminished function (resembling parkinsonism) to increased activity (manifested by dyskinesias)-often occurs over a period of months to years. This time scale is much longer than that described for other drug-induced changes in receptor function. Of most importance, newer drugs-clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole-do not have very high affinity for the $D_{2}$ receptor, which suggests that additional actions are critical to their antipsychotic effects.

It has not been convincingly demonstrated that antagonism of any dopamine receptor other than the $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ receptor plays a role in the action of antipsychotic drugs. Selective $D_{3}$-receptor antagonists may prove therapeutic but are not yet available. Most of the newer "atypical" antipsychotic agents and some of the traditional ones have significant affinity for the $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A}}$ receptor (Table 29-1), suggesting an important role for the serotonin system. Participation of glutamate, GABA, and acetylcholine receptors in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia has also been proposed. Agents targeted at glutamatergic and cholinergic systems are just beginning to be evaluated in schizophrenia.

\section*{DIFFERENCES AMONG ANTI PSYCHOTIC DRUGS}

Although all effective antipsychotic drugs block $D_{2}$ receptors, the degree of this blockade in relation to other actions on receptors varies considerably between drugs. Vast numbers of ligand-receptor binding experiments have been performed in an effort to discover a single receptor action that would best predict antipsychotic efficacy. A summary of the relative receptor-binding affinities of several key agents in such comparisons illustrates the difficulty in drawing simple conclusions from such experiments:
```
Chlorpromazine: $\alpha_{1}=5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A}}>\mathrm{D}_{2}>\mathrm{D}_{1}$
Haloperidol: $\mathrm{D}_{2}>\alpha_{1}>\mathrm{D}_{4}>5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A}}>\mathrm{D}_{1}>\mathrm{H}_{1}$
Clozapine: $\mathrm{D}_{4}=\alpha_{1}>5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A}}>\mathrm{D}_{2}=\mathrm{D}_{1}$
Olanzapine: 5-HT $\mathrm{H}_{2 \mathrm{~A}}>\mathrm{H}_{1}>\mathrm{D}_{4}>\mathrm{D}_{2}>\alpha_{1}>\mathrm{D}_{1}$
Aripiprazole: $\mathrm{D}_{2}=5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A}}>\mathrm{D}_{4}>\alpha_{1}=\mathrm{H}_{1} \gg \mathrm{D}_{1}$
Quetiapine: $\mathrm{H}_{1}>\alpha_{1}>\mathrm{M}_{1,3}>\mathrm{D}_{2}>5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A}}$
```

Thus, most of the atypical antipsychotic agents are at least as potent in inhibiting 5- $\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ receptors as they are in inhibiting $D_{2}$ receptors. The newest, aripiprazole, appears to be a partial agonist of $D_{2}$ receptors. Varying degrees of antagonism of $v_{2}$ adrenoceptors are also seen with risperidone, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole. The clinical relevance of these actions remains to be ascertained.

Current research is directed toward discovering atypical antipsychotic compounds that are either more selective for the mesolimbic system (to reduce their effects on the extrapyramidal system) or have effects
on central neurotransmitter receptors-such as those for acetylcholine and excitatory amino acids-that have been proposed as new targets for antipsychotic action.

In contrast to the search for efficacy, such differences in the receptor effects of various antipsychotics do explain many of their toxicities (Tables 29-1 and 29-2). In particular, extrapyramidal toxicity appears to be associated with high $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ potency.

\section*{PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS}

Most antipsychotic drugs cause unpleasant subjective effects in nonpsychotic individuals; the combination of sleepiness, restlessness, and autonomic effects creates experiences unlike those associated with more familiar sedatives or hypnotics. Nonpsychotic persons also experience impaired performance as judged by a number of psychomotor and psychometric tests. Psychotic individuals, however, may actually show improvement in their performance as the psychosis is alleviated.

\section*{ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC EFFECTS}

Antipsychotic drugs produce shifts in the pattern of electroencephalographic frequencies, usually slowing them and increasing their synchronization. The slowing (hypersynchrony) is sometimes focal or unilateral, which may lead to erroneous diagnostic interpretations. Both the frequency and the amplitude changes induced by psychotropic drugs are readily apparent and can be quantitated by sophisticated electrophysiologic techniques. Some of the neuroleptic agents lower the seizure threshold and induce EEG patterns typical of seizure disorders; however, with careful dosage titration, most can be used safely in epileptic patients.

\section*{ENDOCRINE EFFECTS}

Older antipsychotic drugs produce striking adverse effects on the reproductive system. Amenorrheagalactorrhea, false-positive pregnancy tests, and increased libido have been reported in women, whereas men have experienced decreased libido and gynecomastia. Some of these effects are secondary to blockade of dopamine's tonic inhibition of prolactin secretion; others may be due to increased peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens. Absent or minimal increases of prolactin after some of the newer antipsychotics such as olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole may be a marker of diminished $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ antagonism and hence reduced risks of extrapyramidal system dysfunction and tardive dyskinesia as well as endocrine dysfunction.

\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS}

Orthostatic hypotension and high resting heart rates frequently result from use of the low-potency phenothiazines. Mean arterial pressure, peripheral resistance, and stroke volume are decreased, and heart rate is increased. These effects are predictable from the autonomic actions of these agents (Table 29-2). Abnormal ECGs have been recorded, especially with thioridazine. Changes include prolongation of QT interval and abnormal configurations of the ST segment and T waves. These changes are readily reversed by withdrawing the drug.

Among the newest antipsychotics, prolongation of the QT or QTc interval-with increased risk of dangerous arrhythmias—has been of such concern that the atypical drug sertindole was withdrawn shortly after being marketed. Ziprasidone carries a warning about the risk of significant $\mathrm{QT}_{\mathrm{C}}$ prolongation.

\section*{ANI MAL SCREENI NG TESTS}

Inhibition of conditioned (but not unconditioned) avoidance behavior is one of the most predictive tests of antipsychotic action. Another is the inhibition of amphetamine- or apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior. This inhibition is undoubtedly related to the $D_{2}$ receptor-blocking action of the drugs, countering these two dopamine agonists. Other tests that may predict antipsychotic action are reduction of exploratory behavior without undue sedation, induction of a cataleptic state, inhibition of intracranial self-stimulation of reward areas, and prevention of apomorphine-induced vomiting. Most of these tests are difficult to relate to any model of clinical psychosis.

The psychosis produced by phencyclidine (PCP) has been used as a model for schizophrenia. Because this drug is an antagonist of the NMDA glutamate receptor, attempts have been made to develop antipsychotics that work as NMDA agonists. Sigma opioid and cholecystokinin type b (CCK ${ }_{b}$ ) antagonism have also been suggested as potential targets. Thus far, NMDA receptor-based models have pointed to agents that modulate glutamate release as potential antipsychotics.

\section*{Clinical Pharmacology of Antipsychotic Agents}

\section*{Indications}

\section*{PSYCHIATRIC INDICATIONS}

Schizophrenia is the primary indication for antipsychotic agents, which remain the mainstay of treatment for this condition. Unfortunately, many patients show little response and virtually none show a complete response.

Antipsychotics are also indicated for schizoaffective disorders, which share characteristics of both schizophrenia and affective disorders. The psychotic aspects of the illness require treatment with antipsychotic drugs, which may be used with other drugs such as antidepressants, lithium, or valproic acid. The manic phase in bipolar affective disorder often requires treatment with antipsychotic agents, though lithium or valproic acid supplemented with high-potency benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam or clonazepam) may suffice in milder cases. Recent controlled trials support the efficacy of monotherapy with atypical antipsychotics in the acute phase (up to 4 weeks) of mania, and olanzapine has been approved for this indication.

As mania subsides, the antipsychotic drug may be withdrawn, although maintenance treatment with atypical antipsychotics has become more common. Nonmanic excited states may also be managed by antipsychotics, often in combination with benzodiazepines.

Other indications for the use of antipsychotics include Tourette's syndrome, disturbed behavior in patients with Alzheimer's disease, and, with antidepressants, psychotic depression. Antipsychotics are not indicated for the treatment of various withdrawal syndromes, eg, opioid withdrawal. In small doses antipsychotics have been promoted (wrongly) for the relief of anxiety associated with minor emotional disorders. The antianxiety sedatives (see Chapter 22) are preferred in terms of both safety and acceptability to patients.

\section*{NONPSYCHIATRIC INDICATIONS}

Most older antipsychotic drugs, with the exception of thioridazine, have a strong antiemetic effect. This action is due to dopamine receptor blockade, both centrally (in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the medulla) and peripherally (on receptors in the stomach). Some drugs, such as prochlorperazine and benzquinamide, are promoted solely as antiemetics.

Phenothiazines with shorter side chains have considerable $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-receptor-blocking action and have been used for relief of pruritus or, in the case of promethazine, as preoperative sedatives. The butyrophenone droperidol is used in combination with an opioid, fentanyl, in neuroleptanesthesia. The use of these drugs in anesthesia practice is described in Chapter 25.

\section*{Drug Choice}

Choice among antipsychotic drugs is based mainly on differences in adverse effects and possible differences in efficacy. Since use of the older drugs is still widespread, especially for patients treated in the public sector, knowledge of such agents as chlorpromazine and haloperidol remains relevant. Thus, one should be familiar with one member of each of the three subfamilies of phenothiazines, a member of the thioxanthine and butyrophenone group, and all of the newer compounds-clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole. Each may have special benefits for selected patients. A representative group of antipsychotic drugs is presented in Table 29-3.

New antipsychotic drugs have been shown in some trials to be more effective than older ones for treating
negative symptoms (emotional blunting, social withdrawal, lack of motivation). The floridly psychotic form of the illness accompanied by uncontrollable behavior probably responds equally well to all potent antipsychotics but is still frequently treated with older drugs that offer intramuscular formulations for acute and chronic treatment. Moreover, the low cost of the older drugs contributes to their widespread use despite their clear disadvantages in terms of extrapyramidal side effects and hyperprolactinemia. Several of the newer antipsychotics, including clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, show superiority over haloperidol in terms of overall response in some controlled trials. More comparative studies with aripiprazole are needed to evaluate its relative efficacy. Moreover, the superior side-effect profile of the newer agents and low to absent risk of tardive dyskinesia suggest that these should provide the first line of treatment.

It is not necessary for practitioners to know all the drugs intimately, but they should be familiar with the effects-including the adverse effects-of one or two drugs in each class. The best guide for selecting a drug for an individual patient is the patient's past responses to drugs. Within the older group, the trend has been away from low-potency agents such as chlorpromazine and thioridazine toward the high-potency drugs such as haloperidol. At present, clozapine is limited to those patients who have failed to respond to substantial doses of conventional antipsychotic drugs. The agranulocytosis and seizures associated with this drug prevent more widespread use. Risperidone's superior side-effect profile (compared with haloperidol) at dosages of $6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ or less and the lower risk of tardive dyskinesia have contributed to its widespread use. Olanzapine and quetiapine may have even lower risk and have achieved widespread use. Whether any of the other recently introduced antipsychotic drugs can substitute for clozapine remains to be established.

\section*{Dosage}

The range of effective dosages among various antipsychotics is quite broad. Therapeutic margins are substantial. Assuming that dosages are appropriate, antipsychotics, with the exception of clozapine and perhaps olanzapine, are of equal efficacy in broadly selected groups of patients. However, some patients who fail to respond to one drug may respond to another; for this reason, several drugs may have to be tried to find the one most effective for an individual patient. This phenomenon might be due to the differing profiles of receptor actions of the various drugs. Patients who have become refractory to two or three antipsychotic agents given in substantial doses now become candidates for treatment with clozapine. This drug, in dosages up to $900 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, salvages about $30-50 \%$ of patients previously refractory to $60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ of haloperidol. In such cases, the increased risk of clozapine can well be justified. Risperidone does not appear to substitute for clozapine, although reports are mixed. Whether other antipsychotics will show efficacy similar to that of clozapine remains to be determined.

Some dosage relationships between various antipsychotic drugs, as well as possible therapeutic ranges, are shown in Table 29-4.

\section*{Parenteral Preparations}

Well-tolerated parenteral forms of the high-potency older drugs are available for rapid initiation of treatment as well as for maintenance treatment in noncompliant patients. Since the parenterally administered drugs may have much greater bioavailability than the oral forms, doses should be only a fraction of what might be given orally, and the manufacturer's literature should be consulted. Fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate are suitable for long-term parenteral maintenance therapy in patients who cannot or will not take oral medication.

\section*{Dosage Schedules}

Antipsychotic drugs are often given in divided daily doses, titrating to an effective dosage. After an effective daily dosage has been defined for an individual patient, doses can be given less frequently. Once-daily doses, usually given at night, are feasible for many patients during chronic maintenance treatment. Simplification of dosage schedules leads to better compliance.

\section*{Maintenance Treatment}

A very small minority of schizophrenic patients may recover from an acute episode and require no further drug therapy for prolonged periods. In most cases, the choice is between "as needed" increased doses or addition of other drugs for exacerbations versus continual maintenance treatment with full therapeutic doses. The choice depends on social factors such as the availability of family or friends familiar with the symptoms of early relapse and ready access to care.

\section*{Drug Combinations}

Combining antipsychotic drugs confounds evaluation of the efficacy of the drugs being used. Use of combinations, however, is widespread, with more emerging experimental data supporting such practices. Tricyclic antidepressants or, more often, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be used with antipsychotics for clear symptoms of depression complicating schizophrenia. Lithium or valproic acid is sometimes added to antipsychotic agents with benefit to patients who do not respond to the latter drugs alone. It is uncertain whether such instances represent misdiagnosed cases of mania or schizoaffective
disorder. Sedative drugs may be added for relief of anxiety or insomnia not controlled by antipsychotics.

\section*{Adverse Reactions}

Most of the unwanted effects of antipsychotics are extensions of their known pharmacologic actions (Tables 29-1 and 29-2), but a few effects are allergic and some are idiosyncratic.

\section*{BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS}

The older typical antipsychotic drugs are unpleasant to take. Many patients stop taking these drugs because of the adverse effects, which may be mitigated by giving small doses during the day and the major portion at bedtime. A "pseudodepression" that may be due to drug-induced akinesia usually responds to treatment with antiparkinsonism drugs. Other pseudodepressions may be due to higher doses than needed in a partially remitted patient, in which case decreasing the dose may relieve the symptoms. Toxicconfusional states may occur with very high doses of drugs that have prominent antimuscarinic actions.

\section*{NEUROLOGIC EFFECTS}

Extrapyramidal reactions occurring early during treatment with older agents include typical Parkinson's syndrome, akathisia (uncontrollable restlessness), and acute dystonic reactions (spastic retrocollis or torticollis). Parkinsonism can be treated, when necessary, with conventional antiparkinsonism drugs of the antimuscarinic type or, in rare cases, with amantadine. (Levodopa should never be used in these patients.) Parkinsonism may be self-limiting, so that an attempt to withdraw antiparkinsonism drugs should be made every 3-4 months. Akathisia and dystonic reactions also respond to such treatment, but many prefer to use a sedative antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, eg, diphenhydramine, which can be given either parenterally or orally.

Tardive dyskinesia, as the name implies, is a late-occurring syndrome of abnormal choreoathetoid movements. It is the most important unwanted effect of antipsychotic drugs. It has been proposed that it is caused by a relative cholinergic deficiency secondary to supersensitivity of dopamine receptors in the caudate-putamen. The prevalence varies enormously, but tardive dyskinesia is estimated to have occurred in 20-40\% of chronically treated patients prior to the introduction of the newer atypical antipsycotics. Early recognition is important, since advanced cases may be difficult to reverse. Many treatments have been proposed, but their evaluation is confounded by the fact that the course of the disorder is variable and sometimes self-limited. Most authorities agree that the first step would be to try to discontinue or reduce the dose of the current antipsychotic or switch to one of the newer atypical agents. A logical second step would be to eliminate all drugs with central anticholinergic action, particularly antiparkinsonism drugs and tricyclic antidepressants. These two steps are often enough to bring about improvement. If they fail, the addition of diazepam in doses as high as $30-40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ may add to the improvement by enhancing GABAergic activity.

Seizures, though recognized as a complication of chlorpromazine treatment, were so rare with the highpotency older drugs as to merit little consideration. However, de novo seizures may occur in $2-5 \%$ of patients treated with clozapine.

\section*{AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM EFFECTS}

Most patients are able to tolerate the antimuscarinic adverse effects of antipsychotic drugs. Those who are made too uncomfortable or who develop urinary retention or other severe symptoms can be switched to an agent without significant antimuscarinic action. Orthostatic hypotension or impaired ejaculation-common complications of therapy with chlorpromazine or mesoridazine-should be managed by switching to drugs
with less marked adrenoceptor-blocking actions.

\section*{METABOLIC AND ENDOCRINE EFFECTS}

Weight gain is very common, especially with clozapine and olanzapine, and requires monitoring of food intake, especially carbohydrates. Hyperglycemia may develop, but whether secondary to weight gainassociated insulin resistance or due to other potential mechanisms remains to be clarified.
Hyperprolactinemia in women results in the amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome and infertility; in men, loss of libido, impotence, and infertility may result.

\section*{TOXIC OR ALLERGIC REACTIONS}

Agranulocytosis, cholestatic jaundice, and skin eruptions occur rarely with the high-potency antipsychotic drugs currently used.

In contrast to other antipsychotic agents, clozapine causes agranulocytosis in a small but significant number of patients-approximately $1-2 \%$ of those treated. This serious, potentially fatal effect can develop rapidly, usually between the 6th and 18th weeks of therapy. It is not known whether it represents an immune reaction, but it appears to be reversible upon discontinuance of the drug. Because of the risk of agranulocytosis, patients receiving clozapine must have weekly blood counts for the first 6 months of treatment and every 3 weeks thereafter.

\section*{OCULAR COMPLICATIONS}

Deposits in the anterior portions of the eye (cornea and lens) are a common complication of chlorpromazine therapy. They may accentuate the normal processes of aging of the lens. Thioridazine is the only antipsychotic drug that causes retinal deposits, which in advanced cases may resemble retinitis pigmentosa. The deposits are usually associated with "browning" of vision. The maximum daily dose of thioridazine has been limited to $800 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ to reduce the possibility of this complication.

\section*{CARDIAC TOXI CITY}

Thioridazine in doses exceeding 300 mg daily is almost always associated with minor abnormalities of T waves that are easily reversible. Overdoses of thioridazine are associated with major ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac conduction block, and sudden death; it is not certain whether thioridazine can cause these same disorders when used in therapeutic doses. In view of possible additive antimuscarinic and quinidine-like actions with various tricyclic antidepressants, thioridazine should be combined with the latter drugs only with great care. Among the atypical agents, ziprasidone carries the greatest risk of QT prolongation and therefore should not be combined with other drugs that prolong the QT interval, including thioridazine, pimozide, and quinidine.

\section*{USE IN PREGNANCY; DYSMORPHOGENESIS}

Although the antipsychotic drugs appear to be relatively safe in pregnancy, a small increase in teratogenic risk could be missed. Questions about whether to use these drugs during pregnancy and whether to abort a pregnancy in which the fetus has already been exposed must be decided individually.

\section*{NEUROLEPTIC MALIGNANT SYNDROME}

This life-threatening disorder occurs in patients who are extremely sensitive to the extrapyramidal effects of antipsychotic agents (see also Chapter 16). The initial symptom is marked muscle rigidity. If sweating is impaired, as it often is during treatment with anticholinergic drugs, fever may ensue, often reaching dangerous levels. The stress leukocytosis and high fever associated with this syndrome may erroneously suggest an infectious process. Autonomic instability, with altered blood pressure and pulse rate, is often
present. Creatine kinase isozymes are usually elevated, reflecting muscle damage. This syndrome is believed to result from an excessively rapid blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors. A severe form of extrapyramidal syndrome follows. Early in the course, vigorous treatment of the extrapyramidal syndrome with antiparkinsonism drugs is worthwhile. Muscle relaxants, particularly diazepam, are often useful. Other muscle relaxants, such as dantrolene, or dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, have been reported to be helpful. If fever is present, cooling by physical measures should be tried. Various minor forms of this syndrome are now recognized.

\section*{Drug Interactions}

Antipsychotics produce more important pharmacodynamic than pharmacokinetic interactions because of their multiple effects. Additive effects may occur when these drugs are combined with others that have sedative effects, adrenoceptor-blocking action, anticholinergic effects, and-for thioridazine and ziprasidone-quinidine-like action.

A variety of pharmacokinetic interactions have been reported, but none are of major clinical significance.

\section*{Overdoses}

Poisonings with antipsychotics (unlike tricyclic antidepressants) are rarely fatal, with the exception of those due to mesoridazine and thioridazine. In general, drowsiness proceeds to coma, with an intervening period of agitation. Neuromuscular excitability may be increased and proceed to convulsions. Pupils are miotic, and deep tendon reflexes are decreased. Hypotension and hypothermia are the rule, though fever may be present later in the course. The lethal effects of mesoridazine and thioridazine are related to induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Patients should be given the usual "ABCD" treatment for poisonings (see Chapter 59) and treated supportively. Management of overdoses of thioridazine and mesoridazine, which are complicated by cardiac arrhythmias, is similar to that for tricyclic antidepressants (see Chapter 30).

\section*{Benefits \& Limitations of Drug Treatment}

As noted at the beginning of this chapter, antipsychotics have had a major impact on psychiatric treatment. First, they have shifted the care of patients from mental institutions to the community. For many patients, this shift has provided a better life under more humane circumstances and in many cases has made possible life without frequent use of physical restraints. For others, the tragedy of an aimless existence is now being played out in the streets of our communities rather than in mental institutions.

Second, these drugs have markedly shifted psychiatric thinking to a more biologic orientation. Partly because of research stimulated by the effects of these drugs on schizophrenia, we now know much more about central nervous system physiology and pharmacology than we did before the introduction of these agents. However, despite a great amount of research, schizophrenia remains a scientific mystery and a personal disaster for the patient. Although most schizophrenic patients obtain some degree of benefit from these drugs-in some cases substantial benefit-none are made well by them.

\section*{LITHIUM \& OTHER MOOD-STABI LI ZI NG DRUGS}

Lithium carbonate is often referred to as an "antimanic" drug, but in many parts of the world it is considered a "mood-stabilizing" agent because of its primary action of preventing mood swings in patients with bipolar affective (manic-depressive) disorder. Carbamazepine has also been recognized as effective in
some groups of manic-depressive patients despite not being formally approved for such use. Valproate has recently been approved for the treatment of mania and is being evaluated as a mood stabilizer. Atypical antipsychotics, beginning with olanzapine, are being investigated and approved as antimanic agents and potential mood stabilizers.

\section*{Nature of Bipolar Affective Disorder}

Bipolar affective (manic-depressive) disorder is a frequently diagnosed and very serious psychiatric disorder. Patients with cyclic attacks of mania have many symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia (grandiosity, bellicosity, paranoid thoughts, and overactivity). The ability to treat bipolar disorder effectively has made such diagnostic distinctions important.

The cause of the mood swings characteristic of bipolar affective disorder is unknown, although a preponderance of catecholamine-related activity may be present. Drugs that increase this activity tend to exacerbate mania, whereas those that reduce activity of dopamine or norepinephrine relieve mania. Acetylcholine or glutamate may also be involved. The nature of the abrupt switch from mania to depression experienced by some patients is uncertain. Bipolar disorder has a strong familial component. Genetic studies have identified at least three possible linkages to different chromosomes.

\section*{Basic Pharmacology of Lithium}

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Lithium is a small monovalent cation. Its pharmacokinetics are summarized in Table 29-5.

\section*{Table 29-5. Pharmacokinetics of Lithium.}

\section*{Absorption}

Virtually complete within 6-8 hours; peak plasma levels in 30 minutes to 2 hours

\section*{Distribution}

In total body water; slow entry into intracellular compartment. Initial volume of distribution is $0.5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{kg}$, rising to $0.7-0.9 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{kg}$; some sequestration in bone. No protein binding.

\section*{Metabolism}

None

\section*{Excretion}

Virtually entirely in urine. Lithium clearance about 20\% of creatinine. Plasma half-life about 20 hours.
Target plasma concentration
$0.6-1.4 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$
Dosage
$0.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in divided doses

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Despite considerable investigation, the mode of action of lithium remains unclear. The major possibilities
being investigated include (1) effects on electrolytes and ion transport; (2) effects on neurotransmitters and their release; and (3) effects on second messengers and intracellular enzymes that mediate transmitter action. The last of these three approaches appears to be the most promising.

\section*{EFFECTS ON ELECTROLYTES AND ION TRANSPORT}

Lithium is closely related to sodium in its properties. It can substitute for sodium in generating action potentials and in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{Na}^{+}$exchange across the membrane. It inhibits the latter process, ie, $\mathrm{Li}^{+}-\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ exchange is gradually slowed after lithium is introduced into the body. At therapeutic concentrations (around $1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ), it does not significantly affect the $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ exchange process or the $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase sodium pump.

\section*{EFFECTS ON NEUROTRANSMITTERS}

Lithium appears to enhance some of the actions of serotonin, though findings have been contradictory. Its effects on norepinephrine are variable. The drug may decrease norepinephrine and dopamine turnover, and these effects, if confirmed, might be relevant to its antimanic action. Lithium also appears to block the development of dopamine receptor supersensitivity that may accompany chronic therapy with antipsychotic agents. Finally, lithium may augment the synthesis of acetylcholine, perhaps by increasing choline uptake into nerve terminals.

\section*{EFFECTS ON SECOND MESSENGERS}

Some of the enzymes affected by lithium are listed in Table 29-6. One of the best-defined effects of lithium is its action on inositol phosphates. Early studies of lithium demonstrated changes in brain inositol phosphate levels, but the significance of these changes was not appreciated until the second-messenger roles of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (I $\mathrm{P}_{3}$ ) and diacylglycerol (DAG) were discovered. As described in Chapter 2, IP3 and DAG are important second messengers for both a-adrenergic and muscarinic transmission. Lithium inhibits several important enzymes in the normal recycling of membrane phosphoinositides, including conversion of $I P_{2}$ to $I P_{1}$ (inositol monophosphate) and the conversion of $I P_{1}$ to inositol (Figure 29-4). This block leads to a depletion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), the membrane precursor of $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ and DAG. Over time, the effects of transmitters on the cell diminish in proportion to the amount of activity in the PIP ${ }_{2}$-dependent pathways. Before therapy, such activity might be greatly increased in mania; thus, lithium could cause a selective depression of the overactive circuits.
Table 29-6. Enzymes Affected by Lithium at Therapeutic Concentrations.

\section*{Enzyme Enzyme Function; Action of Lithium}

The rate-limiting enzyme in inositol recycling; inhibited by lithium, resulting in depletion of substrate for IP ${ }_{3}$ production (see Figure 29-4)

Effect of lithium on the IP ${ }_{3}$ and DAG second-messenger system. The schematic diagram shows the synaptic membrane of a neuron. (PIP ${ }_{2}$, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate; PLC, phospholipase-C; G, coupling protein; EFFECTS, activation of protein kinase C , mobilization of intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, etc.) Lithium, by inhibiting the recycling of inositol substrates, may cause depletion of the second-messenger source $\mathrm{PI} \mathrm{P}_{2}$ and therefore reduce the release of IP ${ }_{3}$ and DAG. Lithium may also act by other mechanisms.

Studies of noradrenergic effects in isolated brain tissue indicate that lithium can inhibit norepinephrinesensitive adenylyl cyclase. Such an effect could relate to both its antidepressant and its antimanic effects. The relationship of these effects to lithium's actions on I P $_{3}$ mechanisms is currently unknown.

Because lithium affects second-messenger systems involving both activation of adenylyl cyclase and phosphoinositol turnover, it is not surprising that G proteins are also found to be affected. Several studies suggest that lithium may uncouple receptors from their G proteins; indeed, two of lithium's most common side effects, polyuria and subclinical hypothyroidism, may be due to uncoupling of the vasopressin and
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors from their G proteins.
The major current working hypothesis for lithium's therapeutic mechanism of action supposes that its effects on phosphoinositol turnover, leading to an early relative reduction of myoinositol in human brain, are part of an initiating cascade of intracellular changes. Effects on specific isoforms of protein kinase C may be most relevant. Alterations of protein kinase C-mediated signaling alter gene expression and the production of proteins implicated in long-term neuroplastic events that could underlie long-term mood stabilization.

\section*{Clinical Pharmacology of Lithium}

\section*{Bipolar Affective Disorder}

Until recently, lithium carbonate was the universally preferred treatment for bipolar disorder, especially in the manic phase. With the approval of valproate, olanzapine, and other newer antipsychotics for this indication, a smaller percentage of bipolar patients now receive lithium. This trend is reinforced by the slow onset of action of lithium, which has often been supplemented with concurrent use of antipsychotic drugs or potent benzodiazepines in severely manic patients. The overall success rate for achieving remission from the manic phase of bipolar disorder can be as high as $80 \%$. However, among patients who require hospitalization, success rates are considerably lower. A similar situation applies to maintenance treatment, which is about $60 \%$ effective overall but less in severely ill patients. These considerations have led to increased use of combined treatment in severe cases. After mania is controlled, the antipsychotic drug may be stopped, then the benzodiazepine and lithium continued as maintenance therapy.

The depressive phase of manic-depressive disorder often requires concurrent use of an antidepressant drug (see Chapter 30). Tricyclic antidepressant agents have been linked to precipitation of mania, with more rapid cycling of mood swings, although most patients do not show this effect. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are less likely to induce mania but may have limited efficacy. Bupropion has shown some promising effects but-like tricyclic antidepressants-may induce mania at higher doses. As shown in recent controlled trials, the anticonvulsant lamotrigine is effective for many patients with bipolar depression. For some patients, however, one of the older monoamine oxidase inhibitors may be the antidepressant of choice.

Unlike antipsychotic or antidepressant drugs, which exert several actions on the central or autonomic nervous system, lithium ion at therapeutic concentrations is devoid of autonomic blocking effects and of activating or sedating effects, though it can produce nausea and tremor. Most important is that the prophylactic use of lithium can prevent both mania and depression. Many experts believe that the aggressive marketing of newer drugs has inappropriately produced a shift to drugs that are less effective than lithium for substantial numbers of patients.

\section*{Other Applications}

Recurrent endogenous depression with a cyclic pattern is controlled by either lithium or imipramine, both of which are superior to a placebo.

Schizoaffective disorder, another condition with an affective component characterized by a mixture of schizophrenic symptoms and depression or excitement, is treated with antipsychotic drugs alone or combined with lithium. Various antidepressants are added if depression is present.

Lithium alone is rarely successful in treating schizophrenia, but adding it to an antipsychotic may salvage
an otherwise treatment-resistant patient. Carbamazepine may work equally well when added to an antipsychotic.

An interesting application of lithium that is relatively well supported by controlled studies is as an adjunct to tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in patients with unipolar depression who do not respond fully to monotherapy with the antidepressant. For this application, concentrations of lithium at the lower end of the recommended range for manic depressive illness appear to be adequate.

\section*{Monitoring Treatment}

Clinicians rely on measurements of serum lithium concentrations for assessing both the dosage required for treatment of acute mania and for prophylactic maintenance. These measurements are customarily taken 10-12 hours after the last dose, so all data in the literature pertaining to these concentrations reflect this interval.

An initial determination of serum lithium concentration should be obtained about 5 days after the start of treatment, at which time steady-state conditions should have been attained. If the clinical response suggests a change in dosage, simple arithmetic (new dose equals present dose times desired blood level divided by present blood level) should produce the desired level. The serum concentration attained with the adjusted dosage can be checked in another 5 days. Once the desired concentration has been achieved, levels can be measured at increasing intervals unless the schedule is influenced by intercurrent illness or the introduction of a new drug into the treatment program.

\section*{Maintenance Treatment}

The decision to use lithium as prophylactic treatment depends on many factors: the frequency and severity of previous episodes, a crescendo pattern of appearance, and the degree to which the patient is willing to follow a program of indefinite maintenance therapy. If the present attack was the patient's first or if the patient is unreliable, one might prefer to terminate treatment after the episode has subsided. Patients who have one or more episodes of illness per year are candidates for maintenance treatment. Although some patients can be maintained with serum levels as low as $0.6 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, the best results have been obtained with higher levels, such as $0.9 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$.

\section*{Drug I nteractions}

Renal clearance of lithium is reduced about $25 \%$ by diuretics (eg, thiazides), and doses may need to be reduced by a similar amount. A similar reduction in lithium clearance has been noted with several of the newer nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that block synthesis of prostaglandins. This interaction has not been reported for either aspirin or acetaminophen. All neuroleptics tested to date, with the possible exception of clozapine and the newer antipsychotics, may produce more severe extrapyramidal syndromes when combined with lithium.

\section*{Adverse Effects \& Complications}

Many adverse effects associated with lithium treatment occur at varying times after treatment is started. Some are harmless, but it is important to be alert to adverse effects that may signify impending serious toxic reactions.

\section*{NEUROLOGIC AND PSYCHIATRIC ADVERSE EFFECTS}

Tremor is one of the most common adverse effects of lithium treatment, and it occurs with therapeutic doses. Propranolol and atenolol, which have been reported to be effective in essential tremor, also alleviate
lithium-induced tremor. Other reported neurologic abnormalities include choreoathetosis, motor hyperactivity, ataxia, dysarthria, and aphasia. Psychiatric disturbances at toxic concentrations are generally marked by mental confusion and withdrawal. Appearance of any new neurologic or psychiatric symptoms or signs is a clear indication for temporarily stopping treatment with lithium and close monitoring of serum levels.

\section*{DECREASED THYROID FUNCTION}

Lithium probably decreases thyroid function in most patients exposed to the drug, but the effect is reversible or nonprogressive. Few patients develop frank thyroid enlargement, and fewer still show symptoms of hypothyroidism. Although initial thyroid testing followed by regular monitoring of thyroid function has been proposed, such procedures are not cost-effective. Obtaining a serum TSH concentration every 6-12 months, however, is prudent.

\section*{NEPHROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS AND OTHER RENAL ADVERSE EFFECTS}

Polydipsia and polyuria are common but reversible concomitants of lithium treatment, occurring at therapeutic serum concentrations. The principal physiologic lesion involved is loss of responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). Lithium-induced diabetes insipidus is resistant to vasopressin but responds to amiloride.

An extensive literature has accumulated concerning other forms of renal dysfunction during long-term lithium therapy, including chronic interstitial nephritis and minimal-change glomerulopathy with nephrotic syndrome. Some instances of decreased glomerular filtration rate have been encountered but no instances of marked azotemia or renal failure.

Patients receiving lithium should avoid dehydration and the associated increased concentration of lithium in urine. Periodic tests of renal concentrating ability should be performed to detect changes.

\section*{EDEMA}

Edema is a common adverse effect of lithium treatment and may be related to some effect of lithium on sodium retention. Although weight gain may be expected in patients who become edematous, water retention does not account for the weight gain observed in up to $30 \%$ of patients taking lithium.

\section*{CARDIAC ADVERSE EFFECTS}

The bradycardia-tachycardia ("sick sinus") syndrome is a definite contraindication to the use of lithium because the ion further depresses the sinus node. T-wave flattening is often observed on ECG but is of questionable significance.

\section*{USE DURING PREGNANCY}

Renal clearance of lithium increases during pregnancy and reverts to lower levels immediately after delivery. A patient whose serum lithium concentration is in a good therapeutic range during pregnancy may develop toxic levels following delivery. Special care in monitoring lithium levels is needed at these times. Lithium is transferred to nursing infants through breast milk, in which it has a concentration about one-third to one-half that of serum. Lithium toxicity in newborns is manifested by lethargy, cyanosis, poor suck and Moro reflexes, and perhaps hepatomegaly.

The issue of dysmorphogenesis is not settled. An earlier report suggested an increase in the frequency of cardiac anomalies, especially Ebstein's anomaly, in lithium babies, and it is listed as such in Table 60-1 in this book. However, more recent data suggest that lithium carries a relatively low risk of teratogenic
effects. Further research is needed in this important area.

\section*{MISCELLANEOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS}

Transient acneiform eruptions have been noted early in lithium treatment. Some of them subside with temporary discontinuance of treatment and do not recur with its resumption. Folliculitis is less dramatic and probably occurs more frequently. Leukocytosis is always present during lithium treatment, probably reflecting a direct effect on leukopoiesis rather than mobilization from the marginal pool. This adverse effect has now become a therapeutic effect in patients with low leukocyte counts.

\section*{Overdoses}

Therapeutic overdoses of lithium are more common than those due to deliberate or accidental ingestion of the drug. Therapeutic overdoses are usually due to accumulation of lithium resulting from some change in the patient's status, such as diminished serum sodium, use of diuretics, or fluctuating renal function. Since the tissues will have already equilibrated with the blood, the plasma concentrations of lithium may not be excessively high in proportion to the degree of toxicity; any value over $2 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ must be considered as indicating likely toxicity. Because lithium is a small ion, it is dialyzed readily. Both peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis are effective, though the latter is preferred. Dialysis should be continued until the plasma concentration falls below the usual therapeutic range.

\section*{Valproic Acid}

Valproic acid (valproate), discussed in detail in Chapter 24 as an antiepileptic, has been demonstrated to have antimanic effects and is now being widely used for this indication in the USA. Gabapentin is not effective, leaving the mechanism of action of valproate unclear. Overall, it shows efficacy equivalent to that of lithium during the early weeks of treatment. It is significant that valproic acid has been effective in some patients who have failed to respond to lithium. Moreover, its side-effect profile is such that one can rapidly increase the dosage over a few days to produce blood levels in the apparent therapeutic range, with nausea being the only limiting factor in some patients. The starting dosage is $750 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, increasing rapidly to the $1500-2000 \mathrm{mg}$ range with a recommended maximum dosage of $60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$.

Combinations of valproic acid with other psychotropic medications likely to be used in the management of either phase of bipolar illness are generally well tolerated. Valproic acid is becoming recognized as an appropriate first-line treatment for mania, although it is not clear that it will be as effective as lithium as a maintenance treatment in all subsets of patients. Many clinicians argue for combining valproic acid and lithium in patients who do not fully respond to either agent alone.

\section*{Carbamazepine}

Carbamazepine has been considered to be a reasonable alternative to lithium when the latter is less than optimally efficacious. The mode of action of carbamazepine is unclear, and oxcarbazepine is not effective. Carbamazepine may be used to treat acute mania and also for prophylactic therapy. Adverse effects (discussed in Chapter 24) are generally no greater and sometimes less than those associated with lithium. Carbamazepine may be used alone or, in refractory patients, in combination with lithium or, rarely, valproate.

The use of carbamazepine as a mood stabilizer is similar to its use as an anticonvulsant (see Chapter 24). Dosage usually begins with 200 mg twice daily, with increases as needed. Maintenance dosage is similar to that used for treating epilepsy, ie, $800-1200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. Plasma concentrations between 3 and $14 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ are
considered desirable, although no therapeutic range has been established. Blood dyscrasias have figured prominently in the adverse effects of carbamazepine when it is used as an anticonvulsant, but they have not been a major problem with its use as a mood stabilizer. Overdoses of carbamazepine are a major emergency and should generally be managed like overdoses of tricyclic antidepressants.

\section*{Other Drugs}

Lamotrigine has been reported to be useful in preventing the depression that often follows the manic phase of bipolar disorder.

\section*{ANTI DEPRESSANT AGENTS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Major depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders. At any given moment, about $3-5 \%$ of the population is depressed (point prevalence), and an estimated $10 \%$ of people may become depressed during their lives (lifetime prevalence). The symptoms of depression are often subtle and unrecognized both by patients and by physicians. Patients with vague complaints that resist explanation as manifestations of somatic disorders and those who might be simplistically described as "neurotic" should be suspected of being depressed.
Depression is a heterogeneous disorder that has been characterized and classified in a variety of ways. According to the American Psychiatric Association's modified fourth edition (2000) of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), several diagnoses of affective disorders are possible. Major depression and dysthymia (minor) are pure depressive syndromes, whereas bipolar disorder and cyclothymic disorder signify depression in association with mania. A simplified classification based on presumed origin is as follows: (1) brief reactive or secondary depression (most common), occurring in response to real stimuli such as grief, illness, etc; (2) melancholic and recurrent depression, a genetically determined biochemical disorder manifested by an inability to experience ordinary pleasure or to cope with ordinary life events; and (3) depression associated with bipolar affective (manic-depressive) disorder. Because safe antidepressants are now available, almost any individual with several symptoms of depression that persist beyond a few weeks is a candidate for pharmacologic treatment. Intensive efforts to formalize guidelines for the treatment of depression have been pursued for more than a decade, resulting in guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, and the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry. Pharmacologic treatment is emphasized, although a continuing role for electroconvulsive therapy for delusional or severe forms of life-threatening depression is also noted.

\section*{The Pathogenesis of Major Depression: The Amine Hypothesis and Subsequent Developments}

Soon after the introduction of reserpine in the early 1950s, it became apparent that the drug could induce depression. Studies revealed that the principal mechanism of action of reserpine was to inhibit the neuronal storage of amine neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine. Reserpine induced depression and depleted stores of amine neurotransmitters; therefore, it was reasoned, depression must be associated with decreased functional amine-dependent synaptic transmission. This idea provided the basis for what became known as the amine hypothesis of depression. By extension, drugs that increased amine function in appropriate synaptic areas would relieve depression. A major puzzle in applying this hypothesis was the fact that although the pharmacologic actions of both tricyclic and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor classes of antidepressants are prompt, the clinical effects require weeks to become manifest. Attempts have been made to explain this observation by invoking slow compensatory responses to the initial blockade of amine reuptake or MAO inhibition (see below).

Current brain imaging and biochemical studies in patients do not support a single biologic abnormality as common to most depressions. Rather, prevailing hypotheses emphasize an underlying role for several brain circuits that have a propensity to become dysfunctional, especially following certain stressors, in individuals with a range of genetic predispositions. It is likely that several pathophysiologic processes will ultimately be
identified to account for the presentation of what is now termed major depression .
Nevertheless, the amine hypothesis has provided the major experimental models for the discovery of new antidepressant drugs. As a result, all currently available antidepressants, except bupropion, are classified as having their primary actions on the metabolism, reuptake, or selective receptor antagonism of serotonin, norepinephrine, or both.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF ANTI DEPRESSANTS}

\section*{Chemistry}

A variety of chemical structures have been found to have antidepressant activity. With the exception of bupropion, however, the core antidepressant action of even the newest agents derives from mechanisms proposed for antidepressants that were introduced four decades ago.

\section*{TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS (TCAS)}

Tricyclic antidepressants-so called because of the characteristic three-ring nucleus (Figure 30-1)-have been used clinically for four decades. They closely resemble the phenothiazines chemically and, to a lesser extent, pharmacologically. Like the phenothiazines, tricyclics were first thought to be useful as antihistamines with sedative properties. The discovery of their antidepressant properties was a fortuitous clinical observation. I mipramine and amitriptyline are the prototypical drugs of the class as mixed norepinephrine and serotonin uptake inhibitors, although they also have several other effects.

\section*{SECOND-GENERATION AND SUBSEQUENT AGENTS}

Between 1980 and 2005, thirteen structurally unique antidepressants and one isomeric variation were introduced. The agents classified as second generation and available for clinical use in the USA are shown in Figure 30-2. Amoxapine and maprotiline resemble the structure of the tricyclic agents, whereas trazodone and bupropion are distinctive. Newer, third generation drugs include venlafaxine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, and duloxetine. The structures of these compounds are shown in Figure 30-3. Six additional agents that work mainly through serotonin uptake inhibition are classified together in the following section.

\section*{SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (SSRIS)}

Search for molecules with greater selectivity for the serotonin transporter led to the introduction of fluoxetine -an effective and more selective antidepressant with minimal autonomic toxicity. Since that time, four more SSRIs have been introduced as well as the active enantiomeric form of one, (S) citalopram. All are structurally distinct from the tricyclic molecules (Figure 30-4). These drugs have fewer adverse effects than the tricyclics and have become very popular.

Some monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Phenelzine is the hydrazide of phenylethylamine (see Figure 9-3), whereas tranylcypromine has a cyclopropyl amine side chain and closely resembles dextroamphetamine (see Figure 9-4). These agents are unselective and produce an extremely long-lasting inhibition of the enzyme. Selegiline, which is partially selective for MAO-B, is shown in Figure 28-2.

Tranylcypromine closely resembles dextroamphetamine, which is itself a weak inhibitor of MAO. Tranylcypromine retains some of the sympathomimetic characteristics of the amphetamines. The hydrazides appear to combine irreversibly with the enzyme, whereas tranylcypromine has a prolonged duration of effect even though it is not bound irreversibly. These older MAO inhibitors are nonselective inhibitors of both MAO-A and MAO-B. Selegiline, an MAO inhibitor used in Parkinson's disease that is selective for MAO-B at low doses but less selective at higher doses, has been approved for the treatment of major depression.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

\section*{TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS}

Most tricyclics are incompletely absorbed and undergo significant first-pass metabolism. As a result of high tissue protein binding and relatively high lipid solubility, volumes of distribution tend to be very large.
Tricyclics are metabolized by two major routes: transformation of the tricyclic nucleus and alteration of the aliphatic side chain. Monodemethylation of tertiary amines leads to active metabolites such as desipramine and nortriptyline (which are themselves available as drugs; Figure 30-1). The pharmacokinetic parameters of various antidepressants are summarized in Table 30-1.

\section*{SECOND-GENERATION AND SUBSEQUENT ANTIDEPRESSANTS}

The pharmacokinetics of these drugs are similar to those of the TCAs (Table 30-1). Some have active metabolites. Trazodone and venlafaxine have short plasma half-lives, which mandates divided doses during the day when beginning treatment, although once-a-day dosing may be possible later. Extended-release forms of bupropion and venlafaxine allow for once-a-day dosing in some patients from the outset.

\section*{SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS}

The pharmacokinetic parameters of these drugs are summarized in Table 30-1. Fluoxetine is notable for the long half-life of its active metabolite, norfluoxetine ( $7-9$ days at steady state). This long $t_{1 / 2}$ has allowed the introduction of a formulation for once-weekly dosing. Sertraline and paroxetine have pharmacokinetic parameters similar to those of tricyclics. Citalopram and fluvoxamine resemble fluoxetine.

\section*{MAO INHIBITORS}

The monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The hydrazide inhibitor phenelzine is acetylated in the liver and manifests differences in elimination, depending on the acetylation phenotype of the individual (see Chapter 4). However, inhibition of MAO persists even after these drugs (including selegiline) are no longer detectable in plasma. Therefore, conventional pharmacokinetic parameters (half-life, etc) are not very helpful in governing dosage. It is prudent to assume that the drug effect will persist for 7 days (tranylcypromine) to 2 or 3 weeks (phenelzine,
selegiline) after discontinuance of the drug.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

\section*{ACTIONS OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS ON AMINE NEUROTRANSMITTERS}

The amine hypothesis was buttressed by studies on the mechanism of action of various types of antidepressant drugs. Tricyclics block the amine transporters (uptake pumps; Figure 30-6) known as the norepinephrine and serotonin transporters, NET and SERT, respectively. These transporters terminate amine neurotransmission (see Table 30-2 and Chapter 6). Blockade of these transporters presumably permits a longer sojourn of neurotransmitter in the intrasynaptic space at the receptor site. MAO inhibitors block a major intraneuronal degradative pathway for the amine neurotransmitters, which permits more amines to accumulate in presynaptic stores (Figure 30-6) and more to be released. Some of the secondgeneration antidepressants have similar strong effects on amine transporters, whereas others have only moderate or minimal effects on reuptake or metabolism. Countering this simple model of increased synaptic activity is increasing evidence of alterations in presynaptic regulation of neurotransmitter release. Presynaptic autoreceptors respond to increased synaptic transmitter by down-regulating transmitter synthesis and release. Furthermore, some (but not all) of these regulatory receptors may themselves be down-regulated. These changes occur on a slower time scale more in keeping with the clinically observed effects.

Schematic diagram showing some of the potential sites of action of antidepressant drugs. The primary neuron is shown as releasing a transmitter amine (NT). A modulating neuron may release a second transmitter (NT ${ }_{x}$ ), regulating the activity of the primary neuron. The most consistent observed effect of the antidepressants (other than MAO inhibitors) is inhibition of the reuptake transporters (T) for norepinephrine or serotonin. The MAO inhibitors increase the vesicular stores of both NE and 5-HT. Other direct or indirect effects include initial increase in activation of pre- and postsynaptic receptors and subsequent desensitization or down-regulation of transmitter synthesis from an amino acid (AA), receptor numbers, or postreceptor mechanisms. Desensitization resulting from antidepressant use has been reported for $a_{2}, \mathrm{~B}$, and $5-\mathrm{HT}_{1 \mathrm{~A}}$ systems (color). VAT denotes a vesicle-associated transporter.

2 Significant $c_{2}$-adrenoceptor antagonism.

Trazodone, nefazodone, and mirtazapine stand out as agents in which antagonism of subtypes of serotonin receptors ( $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A}}$ or $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}$ ) may be important in their action. Mirtazapine is unique in including antagonism of $a_{2}$ norepinephrine receptors as presumably contributing to its therapeutic effects. Bupropion has been found to alter the output of norepinephrine in humans following chronic administration through some as yet unidentified primary mechanism as well as occupying about $25 \%$ of dopamine uptake transporters (DAT) in the brain as revealed by positron emission tomography. (Since it has been shown that effective doses of SSRIs occupy $80 \%$ of serotonin uptake sites, the clinical relevance of $25 \%$ DAT occupancy is uncertain.) Thus, even the newest antidepressants can still be categorized as possibly working through serotonergic and noradrenergic effects with the additional possibility of a role for dopamine. Increased synaptic dopamine has often been invoked as relevant to the efficacy of MAOIs.

\section*{RECEPTOR AND POSTRECEPTOR EFFECTS}

Considerable attention has been paid to the long-term postsynaptic effects of increased neurotransmitters in the synapses. In tests of postsynaptic effects, especially of the tricyclics, cAMP concentrations have consistently decreased rather than increased. In addition, the number of receptors for the neurotransmitters can decrease over the same time course as clinical improvement in patients. Thus, the initial increase in neurotransmitter seen with some antidepressants appears to produce, over time, a compensatory decrease in receptor activity, ie, down-regulation of certain postsynaptic as well as presynaptic receptors.

It has long been thought that enhanced serotonergic transmission, albeit mediated through diverse mechanisms, might be a common effect of antidepressants even without an increase in synaptic serotonin. Moreover, selective antagonism of either norepinephrine or serotonin receptors as opposed to that of the 5HT transporter may lead to enhanced extracellular serotonin due to the complex manner in which these neurotransmitters are regulated.

Most recently, long-term intracellular changes involving phosphorylation of various regulatory elements, including those within the nucleus, have been implicated as relevant to antidepressant action. It is possible that effects on certain neurotrophic factors-factors critical to sustained survival and function of neurons in the adult nervous system-may be central to the actions of antidepressants.

Clinical studies have indirectly tested the relevance of findings from animals for norepinephrine or serotonin function. The approach has been to reduce the amino acid precursor of serotonin, tryptophan, in the diet and, by implication, the amount of available neurotransmitter in the brain, since tryptophan availability can be rate-limiting in the formation of serotonin. Severely tryptophan-depleted diets reduce plasma tryptophan and acutely reverse antidepressant responses to SSRIs but not to NET inhibitors. Similarly, depletion of the norepinephrine amino acid precursor tyrosine can reverse antidepressant effects of the relatively selective NET inhibitor, desipramine. These findings support the hypothesis that enhanced serotonin and norepinephrine throughput is necessary for the antidepressant actions of the respective transporter inhibitors. However, tryptophan depletion does not consistently worsen the condition of unmedicated depressed patients. Thus, there is still no clear relationship between serotonin and depression or antidepressant mechanisms in general.

\section*{EFFECTS OF SPECI FIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS}

\section*{Tricyclics}

The first-generation antidepressants demonstrate varying degrees of selectivity for the reuptake pumps for norepinephrine and serotonin (Table 30-2) but selectivity is much lower than for the SSRIs. They also have
numerous autonomic actions, as described below under Adverse Effects.

\section*{Second-Generation Agents}

Amoxapine is a metabolite of the antipsychotic drug loxapine and retains some of its antipsychotic action and dopamine receptor antagonism (see Chapter 29). A combination of antidepressant and antipsychotic actions might make it a suitable drug for depression in psychotic patients. However, the dopamine antagonism may cause akathisia, parkinsonism, amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome, and perhaps tardive dyskinesia.

Maprotiline (a tetracyclic drug) is most like desipramine in terms of its potent norepinephrine uptake inhibition. Like desipramine, it has fewer sedative and antimuscarinic actions than the older tricyclics.

Clinical experience with trazodone has indicated unpredictable efficacy for depression, although it has proved very useful as a hypnotic, sometimes being combined with MAOIs, which disturb sleep.

\section*{Subsequent Non-SSRI Agents}

Four antidepressants—nefazodone, venlafaxine, duloxetine, and mirtazapine—are all related to earlier agents in either structure or mechanism of action. Nefazodone is closely related to trazodone but is less sedating. It produces fewer adverse sexual effects than the SSRIs (see below) but is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. (Fluvoxamine causes the same inhibition of CYP3A4.)

Venlafaxine is a potent inhibitor of serotonin transport and a weaker inhibitor of norepinephrine transport. At lower therapeutic doses, venlafaxine behaves like an SSRI. At high doses (more than $225 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ), it produces mild to moderate increases of heart rate and blood pressure attributable to norepinephrine transporter inhibition. Doses in the range of $225 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ or more may confer broader therapeutic effects than SSRIs, but titration up to these doses is needed to control adverse effects.

Mirtazapine is a potent antihistaminic with greater sedating effects than the other second- and thirdgeneration antidepressants. Its use is also more likely to be associated with weight gain. The hypothesized mechanism of action of mirtazapine combines $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ receptor and $\alpha$-adrenoceptor antagonism and, if established in humans, would be unique among available drugs. Thus, mirtazapine may prove beneficial in patients who can tolerate its sedative effects and do not respond well to SSRIs or cannot tolerate their sexual adverse effects.

\section*{Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors}

These drugs achieve high ratios of SERT versus NET inhibition of 300 to 7000 (Table 30-2). Fluoxetine was the first SSRI to reach general clinical use. Paroxetine and sertraline differ mainly in having shorter halflives and different potencies as inhibitors of specific P450 isoenzymes. Racemic citalopram and (S) citalopram (escitalopram), the most selective SSRIs of all, have achieved very widespread use. Although the SSRIs have not been shown to be more effective overall than prior drugs, they lack many of the toxicities of the tricyclic and heterocyclic antidepressants. Thus, patient acceptance has been high despite their own adverse effects.

\section*{MAO Inhibitors}

MAO-A (isoform A) is the amine oxidase primarily responsible for norepinephrine, serotonin, and tyramine metabolism. MAO-B is more selective for dopamine. The irreversible inhibitors available in the USA are nonselective and at the doses used block both forms of the enzyme. I rreversible block of MAO, characteristic of the older MAO inhibitors, allows significant accumulation of tyramine and loss of the first-
pass metabolism that protects against tyramine in foods (see Adverse Effects). Because they result in replacement of the normal transmitter (norepinephrine) stored in noradrenergic nerve terminal vesicles with a false transmitter (octopamine), they may cause significant hypotension.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF ANTI DEPRESSANTS}

\section*{Clinical Indications}

The major indication for antidepressant drugs is to treat depression, but a number of other uses have been established by clinical experience and controlled trials.

\section*{DEPRESSION}

This indication has been kept broad deliberately, even though evidence from clinical studies strongly suggests that the drugs are specifically useful only in major depressive episodes. Major depressive episodes are diagnosed primarily on the basis of the persistent degree and quality of depressed mood or loss of interest and pleasure in most activities, usually accompanied by disturbances of sleep, appetite, sexual drive, activity, or ability to concentrate. The diagnosis of major depression may be uncertain in individual patients, so that on balance this condition is underdiagnosed and undertreated. The depressed phase of bipolar illness definitely requires pharmacologic treatment given the high rate of suicide in persons with this disorder. Standard antidepressants are usually added to lithium or another antimanic agent; SSRIs are less likely to induce mania than the older tricyclic agents. There are, however, few controlled studies on their relative efficacy or proper duration of use. Finally, recent controlled studies support the additional labeling of the anticonvulsant lamotrigine for maintenance and prophylaxis of the depressed phase of bipolar illness.

\section*{ANXIETY DISORDERS: PANIC, GENERALIZED ANXIETY, AND SOCIAL PHOBIA}

Imipramine was first shown in 1962 to have a beneficial effect in the acute episodes of anxiety that have come to be known as panic attacks. It has also been demonstrated that SSRIs, venlafaxine, and duloxetine are effective in panic, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and social phobia, but they require 6-8 weeks of treatment. Since there is considerable comorbidity between depression and anxiety disorders, it is advantageous for many patients to use a treatment that is helpful for both conditions. In some instances, because they are well tolerated and their clinical effects become evident promptly, benzodiazepines remain the preferred drugs for anxiety disorders despite the physiologic dependence associated with long-term use.

\section*{OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDERS}

Potent SSRIs are uniquely effective for treating these disorders. Recent studies have focused on fluoxetine and other SSRIs, although clomipramine, the most potent mixed serotonin and norepinephrine transporter inhibitor, may be especially effective. Fluvoxamine is marketed exclusively for this disorder in the United States.

\section*{ENURESIS}

Enuresis is an established indication for tricyclics. Proof of efficacy for this indication is substantial, but drug therapy is not the preferred approach, especially given the risks of cardiovascular effects and the dangers from overdoses.

\section*{CHRONIC PAIN}

Clinicians in pain clinics have found tricyclics to be useful for treating a variety of chronically painful states that often cannot be definitively diagnosed. It is likely that tricyclics and other combined serotonin-
norepinephrine transporter inhibitors work directly on pain pathways and do not work simply on depressive equivalents secondary to chronic pain.

In addition to TCAs, controlled studies of higher doses of venlafaxine show efficacy in pain. Duloxetine has similar effects at doses closer to standard antidepressant doses. SSRIs, however, are not effective for chronic pain.

\section*{OTHER INDICATIONS}

Certain antidepressants have been shown to be effective for eating disorders, especially bulimia (fluoxetine), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (fluoxetine), and attention deficit hyperkinetic disorder (imipramine, desipramine). Atomoxetine was recently introduced for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This selective NET inhibitor does not appear to have the abuse liability of the standard drugs for this condition (methylphenidate and amphetamine; see Chapter 9).

\section*{Drug Choice}

Controlled comparisons of the available antidepressants have usually led to the conclusion that they are roughly equivalent in efficacy. Although this may be true for groups of patients, individual patients may respond better to one drug than to another. European studies show that patients depressed enough to be hospitalized respond better to classic tricyclics than to monotherapy with SSRIs. Meta-analyses of outpatient studies also show a greater efficacy of tricyclics over SSRIs in patients who complete trials. The greater tolerability of the SSRIs, however, makes them the preferred agent for most patients. At high doses ( $>225 \mathrm{mg}$ ), venlafaxine also shows greater efficacy than the SSRIs. Thus, finding the right drug and the right dose for the individual patient must be accomplished empirically. The history of the patient's drug experience is the most valuable guide.

Tricyclics and the second- and third-generation agents differ mainly in the degree of sedation they produce (greatest with amitriptyline, doxepin, trazodone, and mirtazapine) and their antimuscarinic effects (greatest with amitriptyline and doxepin; Table 30-2). SSRIs are generally free of sedative effects and safe in overdose. Combined with their mild adverse effects, these qualities account for the popularity of SSRIs as the most widely prescribed antidepressants.

In contrast, amoxapine and maprotiline seem to have as many sedative and autonomic actions as most tricyclics; more recently introduced antidepressants such as bupropion, venlafaxine, and duloxetine are, like SSRIs, mostly free of such effects, whereas nefazodone and mirtazapine are very sedating. Amoxapine and maprotiline are at least as dangerous as the tricyclics when taken in overdose; the other newer agents seem to be safer.

No special indications for particular types of depression have been found for SSRIs or other newer antidepressants. The popularity of these drugs, despite their higher cost, is due principally to their greater acceptance by patients. A provocative clinical report that fluoxetine use increased suicidal or aggressive ideation was not supported by subsequent analyses of massive databases. In 2004, however, because of an apparent increase in suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children on SSRIs, the FDA issued a general warning about increased risk of suicide with newer antidepressants. Studies of concurrent epidemiologic data involving much larger numbers than the trials cited by the FDA came to the opposite conclusion-any increase in suicide risk is seen only with older antidepressants (primarily tricyclics).

Clinical reports, prescription databases, and a few trials support the use of SSRIs in combination with the
older tricyclics, especially desipramine; with bupropion; and, most recently, with mirtazapine in patients who do not show an adequate response to a single agent.

MAO inhibitors remain helpful despite their adverse effects but are reserved for patients who have failed to respond to at least two courses of monotherapy or combination treatment with different classes of antidepressants.

Lithium, a mood stabilizer (see Chapter 29), in combination with an antidepressant may achieve a favorable response not obtained by the antidepressant alone.

\section*{Dosages}

The usual daily dose ranges of antidepressants are shown in Table 30-3. Doses are almost always determined empirically; the patient's acceptance of adverse effects is the usual limiting factor. Tolerance to some of the objectionable effects may develop, so that the usual pattern of treatment has been to start with small doses, increasing either to a predetermined daily dose, or to one that produces relief of depression, or to the maximum tolerated dose (except in the case of nortriptyline, which loses efficacy at plasma concentrations over $150 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ ).

MAO inhibitors, bupropion, fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, and venlafaxine are customarily given early in the day when initiating treatment, because they can be somewhat stimulating and may cause insomnia if given late. After a few weeks on the drug, however, any such effects should disappear, and time of day administered is rarely important. Virtually all the other antidepressants have varying degrees of sedative effects and are best given near bedtime. Autonomic adverse effects also tend to be less troublesome if the dose is given late.

\section*{Maintenance Treatment}

Whether or not to undertake long-term maintenance treatment of a depressed patient depends entirely on the actual history of the disorder in that individual. If the depressive episode was the patient's first and if the patient responded quickly and satisfactorily to drug therapy, it is reasonable to gradually withdraw treatment over a period of a few weeks after treating for 6-9 months. If relapse does not occur, drug treatment can be stopped until another episode occurs, which is unpredictable but highly probable. Pooled data from randomized trials covering 6-36 months reveal a more than 50\% reduction in relapses or recurrences if patients are maintained on an antidepressant. Thus, a patient who has had previous episodes of depression-especially if each succeeding one was more severe and more difficult to treat-is a candidate for maintenance therapy. Maintenance therapy requires the full dosage used to obtain the initial response. The duration of treatment varies, though many patients require maintenance treatment indefinitely.

\section*{Unresponsive Patients}

One third or more of patients do not respond (defined as 50\% or more improvement) to treatment, and almost two thirds fail to achieve or maintain full remission on any single regimen. In evaluating any patient's limited response to a treatment, one should consider the five D's: diagnosis, drug, dose, duration of treatment, and different treatment.

Diagnosis might be reassessed if the patient shows little response over a period of 2-3 weeks of adequate dosage or plasma concentrations. Whether or not the patient is bipolar, lithium might be added (see Chapter 29); if psychotic, treatment might be augmented with an antipsychotic agent. Combination of an SSRI with desipramine, bupropion, or mirtazapine is safe and effective for some patients. There is no good pharmacologic rationale for combining venlafaxine or duloxetine with SSRIs because they are full serotonin reuptake inhibitors at doses that inhibit norepinephrine uptake; rather, they might be combined with bupropion or mirtazapine. At least 6-8 weeks should be tried before giving up on a drug or combination as long as there is some evidence of improvement by 3-4 weeks.

One strategy is to begin treatment with an SSRI in mild to moderate outpatient depression and then augment by adding a drug of a different class for more impaired patients. Otherwise, switch to a drug of a
different class. Most experts would move through various antidepressant drug classes in the search for the right drug rather than through various drugs within a class.

Dose and duration of treatment for depression must be considered. Many treatment failures are due to inadequate dosage, which should be pushed to the limits of the patient's tolerance in refractory cases. Duration of treatment is even more important. In over 50\% of patients, full response does not occur until there has been at least 8 weeks of treatment.

Finally, some patients may need a completely different type of treatment, such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT is often viewed as a treatment of last resort, but it should not be withheld from patients with depression who cannot be helped by drug therapy. For patients with psychotic depression, ECT may be a treatment of first choice.

Noncompliance is an important cause of lack of response to drugs. Patients should be warned also that noticeable improvement may be slow, with the first clear signs taking perhaps 3 weeks or more. Inability to tolerate adverse effects and discouragement with treatment are two major causes for noncompliance and for failure of antidepressants to show efficacy.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Adverse effects of various antidepressants are summarized in Table 30-4. Most common unwanted effects are minor, but they may seriously affect patient compliance. Seriously depressed patients, however, can tolerate unwanted effects, perhaps because they are too depressed to care. In healthy volunteers, even moderate doses of the tricyclics-amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, and doxepin-are poorly tolerated. With the SSRIs, transient nausea is the most frequent complaint, and decreased libido and sexual dysfunction create the greatest concerns in patients during maintenance treatment. Concerns about teratogenic potential recently led to revised labeling of paroxetine.

${ }^{1}$ Interactions with tyramine-containing foods; interactions that cause serotonin syndrome (see Chapter 16).

Among the major drawbacks of most first-generation antidepressants are their many "irrelevant" pharmacologic actions, a trait inherited from the phenothiazine antipsychotic agents. It appears that the antimuscarinic, antihistaminic, and adrenoceptor-blocking actions of tricyclic antidepressants contribute only to the undesirable effects of these agents. Blurred vision, dry mouth, urinary hesitancy or retention, and constipation represent the most common antimuscarinic complaints. Postural hypotension is a significant and potentially dangerous manifestation of the a-blocking action, especially in the elderly.

\section*{Drug Interactions}

\section*{PHARMACODYNAMIC INTERACTIONS}

The pharmacodynamic interactions of antidepressants with other drugs depend on their class. Those with sedative effects may be additive with other sedatives, especially alcohol. Patients taking tricyclics or mirtazapine should be warned that use of alcohol may lead to greater than expected impairment of driving ability. MAO inhibitors, by increasing stores of catecholamines, sensitize the patient to indirectly acting sympathomimetics such as tyramine, which is found in some fermented foods and beverages, and to sympathomimetic drugs such as diethylpropion, phenylpropanolamine, or botanicals containing ephedrine. Such sensitization can result in dangerous and-rarely-fatal hypertensive reactions. A pharmacodynamic interaction may occur when fluoxetine or another SSRI is used in the presence of an MAO inhibitor. The combination of increased stores of 5-HT plus inhibition of reuptake after release is thought to result in a marked increase of serotonin in the synapses, leading to a serotonin syndrome. This sometimes fatal syndrome includes hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, myoclonus, and rapid changes in mental status and vital signs (see Chapter 16).

\section*{PHARMACOKI NETIC INTERACTIONS}

The most likely pharmacokinetic interactions are between the potent inhibitors of P450 2D6, paroxetine and fluoxetine, and those drugs highly dependent on this pathway for clearance (eg, desipramine, nortriptyline, flecainide; see also Chapter 4). Actual instances of clinically significant interactions are extremely rare, and there are only a handful of case reports after cumulative exposure of more than 50 million patients to these SSRI drugs. Inhibition of P450 3A4 could possibly occur at high concentrations of nefazodone and fluvoxamine and block the metabolism of the many substrates of this isoform.

\section*{Overdoses}

\section*{TRI CYCLI CS}

Tricyclics are extremely dangerous when taken in overdose quantities, and depressed patients are more likely than others to be suicidal. Prescriptions should therefore be limited to amounts less than 1.25 g , or 50 dose units of 25 mg , on a "no refill" basis. If suicide is a serious possibility, the tablets should be entrusted to a family member. The drugs must be kept away from children. Both accidental and deliberate overdoses continue to occur and are serious medical emergencies. Major effects and management of overdosage are discussed in Chapter 59.

\section*{SECOND- AND THIRD-GENERATION DRUGS}

Overdoses of amoxapine are characterized by severe neurotoxicity, with seizures that are difficult to control. Overdoses of maprotiline also have a tendency to cause seizures as well as cardiotoxicity. Overdoses of the other heterocyclic drugs appear to create only minor problems and can usually be managed with purely supportive measures.

\section*{MAO INHIBITORS}

Intoxication with MAO inhibitors is unusual. Agitation, delirium, and neuromuscular excitability are followed by obtunded consciousness, seizures, shock, and hyperthermia. Supportive treatment is usually all that is required, though sedative phenothiazines with adrenoceptor-blocking action, such as chlorpromazine, may be useful.

\section*{SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS}

A few deaths have occurred during overdosage of SSRIs when other drugs were also being taken. The likelihood of fatalities from SSRI overdoses is extremely low. In case of overdose, only supportive treatment can be offered, since the high volume of distribution, as with other antidepressants, rules out removal of
drug by dialysis. As much as 2.6 g of sertraline has been taken with survival. Overdoses of paroxetine are relatively benign: Up to 850 mg has been taken with no evidence of cardiotoxicity.

\section*{OPIOID ANALGESICS \& ANTAGONISTS: I NTRODUCTION}

Morphine, the prototypical opioid agonist, has long been known to relieve severe pain with remarkable efficacy. The opium poppy is the source of crude opium from which Sertürner in 1803 isolated morphine, the pure alkaloid and named it after Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams. It remains the standard against which all drugs that have strong analgesic action are compared. These drugs are collectively known as opioid analgesics and include not only the natural and semisynthetic alkaloid derivatives from opium but also include synthetic surrogates, other opioid-like drugs whose actions are blocked by the nonselective antagonist naloxone, plus several endogenous peptides that interact with the several subtypes of opioid receptors.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF THE OPIOID ANALGESI CS}

\section*{Source}

Opium, the source of morphine, is obtained from the poppy, Papaver somniferum and P album. After incision, the poppy seed pod exudes a white substance that turns into a brown gum that is crude opium. Opium contains many alkaloids, the principle one being morphine, which is present in a concentration of about $10 \%$. Codeine is synthesized commercially from morphine.

\section*{Classification \& Chemistry}

Opioid drugs include full agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists (see Chapter 2 for definitions). Morphine is a full agonist at the $\mu(\mathrm{mu})$ opioid receptor, the major analgesic opioid receptor (Table 31-1). In contrast, codeine functions as a partial (or "weak") H--receptor agonist. Simple substitution of an allyl group on the nitrogen of the full agonist morphine plus addition of a single hydroxyl group results in naloxone, a strong $\mu$-receptor antagonist. The structures of some of these compounds are shown later in this chapter. Some opioids, eg, nalbuphine, are capable of producing an agonist (or partial agonist) effect at one opioid receptor subtype and an antagonist effect at another. Not only can the activating properties of opioid analgesics be manipulated by pharmaceutical chemistry, certain opioid analgesics are modified in the liver, resulting in compounds with greater analgesic action (see Pharmacokinetics, Metabolism).

\section*{Endogenous Opioid Peptides}

Opioid alkaloids (eg, morphine) produce analgesia through actions at regions in the central nervous system (CNS) that contain peptides with opioid-like pharmacologic properties. The general term currently used for these endogenous substances is endogenous opioid peptides.

Three families of endogenous opioid peptides have been described in detail: the endorphins, the pentapeptides methionine-enkephalin (met-enkephalin) and leucine-enkephalin (leu-enkephalin), and the dynorphins. The three families of opioid receptors have overlapping affinities for these endogenous peptides (Table 31-1).

The endogenous opioid peptides are derived from three precursor proteins: prepro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), preproenkephalin (proenkephalin A), and preprodynorphin (proenkephalin B). POMC contains the met-enkephalin sequence, B-endorphin, and several nonopioid peptides, including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), B-lipotropin, and melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Preproenkephalin contains six copies of met-enkephalin and one copy of leu-enkephalin. Leu- and met-enkephalin have slightly higher affinity for the $\delta$ (delta) than for the $\mu$ opioid receptor (Table 31-1). Preprodynorphin yields several active opioid peptides that contain the leu-enkephalin sequence. These are dynorphin A, dynorphin B, and and B neoendorphins. More recently, the endogenous peptides endomorphin-1 and endomorphin-2 have been found to possess many of the properties of opioid peptides, notably analgesia and high-affinity binding to the $\mu$-receptor. Research is focused on whether endomorphins selectively activate $\mu$-receptor subtypes and much remains unknown, including the identity of their gene. Both the endogenous opioid precursor molecules and the endomorphins are present at CNS sites that have been implicated in pain modulation. Evidence suggests that they can be released during stressful conditions such as pain or the anticipation of pain to diminish the sensation of noxious stimuli.

In contrast to the analgesic role of leu- and met-enkephalin, an analgesic action of dynorphin A-through its binding to $\kappa$ (kappa) opioid receptors-remains controversial. Dynorphin $A$ is also found in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where it plays a critical role in the sensitization of nociceptive neurotransmission. Increased levels of dynorphin can be found in the dorsal horn after tissue injury and inflammation. This elevated dynorphin level is believed to increase pain and induce a state of long-lasting hyperalgesia. The pronociceptive action of dynorphin in the spinal cord appears to be independent of the opioid receptor system. Rather, dynorphin A can bind and activate the N -methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex, a site of action that is the focus of intense therapeutic development.

Recently, a novel receptor-ligand system homologous to the opioid peptides has been found. The principle receptor for this system is the G protein-coupled orphanin opioid-receptor-like subtype 1 (ORL1). Its endogenous ligand has been termed nociceptin by one group of investigators and orphanin FQ by
another group. This ligand-receptor system is currently known as the N/ OFQ system. Nociceptin is structurally similar to dynorphin except for the absence of an N-terminal tyrosine; it acts only at the ORL1 receptor. Although widely expressed in the CNS and periphery, this system has a diverse pharmacology, capable of opposing classic $\mu$.receptor-mediated analgesia as well as modulating drug reward, reinforcement, learning, and memory processes.

\section*{ABSORPTION}

Most opioid analgesics are well absorbed when given by subcutaneous, intramuscular, and oral routes. However, because of the first-pass effect, the oral dose of the opioid (eg, morphine) may need to be much higher than the parenteral dose to elicit a therapeutic effect. Considerable interpatient variability exists in first-pass opioid metabolism, making prediction of an effective oral dose difficult. Certain analgesics such as codeine and oxycodone are effective orally because they have reduced first-pass metabolism. Nasal insufflation of certain opioids can result in rapid therapeutic blood levels by avoiding first-pass metabolism. Other routes of opioid administration include oral mucosa via lozenges, and transdermal via transdermal patches. The latter can provide delivery of potent analgesics over days.

\section*{DISTRI BUTION}

The uptake of opioids by various organs and tissues is a function of both physiologic and chemical factors. Although all opioids bind to plasma proteins with varying affinity, the drugs rapidly leave the blood compartment and localize in highest concentrations in tissues that are highly perfused such as the brain, lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen. Drug concentrations in skeletal muscle may be much lower, but this tissue serves as the main reservoir because of its greater bulk. Even though blood flow to fatty tissue is much lower than to the highly perfused tissues, accumulation can be very important, particularly after frequent high-dose administration or continuous infusion of highly lipophilic opioids that are slowly metabolized, eg, fentanyl.

\section*{METABOLISM}

The opioids are converted in large part to polar metabolites (mostly glucuronides), which are then readily excreted by the kidneys. For example, morphine, which contains free hydroxyl groups, is primarily conjugated to morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), a compound with neuroexcitatory properties. The neuroexcitatory effects of M3G do not appear to be mediated by $\mu$.receptors but rather by the GABA/glycinergic system. In contrast, approximately $10 \%$ of morphine is metabolized to morphine-6glucuronide (M6G), an active metabolite with analgesic potency four to six times that of its parent compound. However, these relatively polar metabolites have limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and probably do not contribute significantly to the usual CNS effects of morphine given acutely. Nevertheless, accumulation of these metabolites may produce unexpected adverse effects in patients with renal failure or when exceptionally large doses of morphine are administered or high doses are administered over long periods. This can result in M3G-induced CNS excitation (seizures) or enhanced and prolonged opioid action produced by M6G. CNS uptake of M3G and, to a lesser extent, M6G can be enhanced by coadministration with probenecid or with drugs that inhibit the P-glycoprotein drug transporter. Like morphine, hydromorphone is metabolized by conjugation, yielding hydromorphone-3glucuronide (H3G), which has CNS excitatory properties. However, hydromorphone has not been shown to form significant amounts of a 6-glucuronide metabolite.

The effects of these active metabolites should be considered before the administration of morphine or hydromorphone, especially when given at high doses.

Esters (eg, heroin, remifentanil) are rapidly hydrolyzed by common tissue esterases. Heroin (diacetylmorphine) is hydrolyzed to monoacetylmorphine and finally to morphine, which is then conjugated with glucuronic acid.

Hepatic oxidative metabolism is the primary route of degradation of the phenylpiperidine opioids (meperidine, fentanyl, alfentanil, sufentanil) and eventually leaves only small quantities of the parent compound unchanged for excretion. However, accumulation of a demethylated metabolite of meperidine, normeperidine, may occur in patients with decreased renal function and in those receiving multiple high doses of the drug. In high concentrations, normeperidine may cause seizures. In contrast, no active metabolites of fentanyl have been reported. The P450 isozyme CYP3A4 metabolizes fentanyl by Ndealkylation in the liver. CYP3A4 is also present in the mucosa of the small intestine and contributes to the first-pass metabolism of fentanyl when it is taken orally. Codeine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone undergo metabolism in the liver by P450 isozyme CYP2D6, resulting in the production of metabolites of greater potency. For example, codeine is demethylated to morphine. Genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 has been documented and linked to the variation in analgesic response seen among patients. Nevertheless, the metabolites of oxycodone and hydrocodone may be of minor consequence because the parent compounds are currently believed to be directly responsible for the majority of their analgesic actions. In the case of codeine, conversion to morphine may be of greater importance because codeine itself has relatively low affinity for opioid receptors.

\section*{EXCRETION}

Polar metabolites, including glucuronide conjugates of opioid analgesics, are excreted mainly in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged drug may also be found in the urine. In addition, glucuronide conjugates are found in the bile, but enterohepatic circulation represents only a small portion of the excretory process.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

\section*{MECHANISM OF ACTION}

Opioid agonists produce analgesia by binding to specific G protein-coupled receptors that are located in brain and spinal cord regions involved in the transmission and modulation of pain.

\section*{Receptor Types}

As noted, three major classes of opioid receptors ( $\mu, \delta$, and $\kappa_{2}$ ) have been identified in various nervous system sites and in other tissues (Table 31-1). Each of the three major receptors has now been cloned. All are members of the G protein-coupled family of receptors and show significant amino acid sequence homologies. Multiple receptor subtypes have been proposed based on pharmacologic criteria, including $\mu_{1}$, $\mu_{2} ; \delta_{1}, \delta_{2}$; and $\kappa_{1}, \kappa_{2}$, and $\kappa_{3}$. However, genes encoding only one subtype from each of the $\mu_{1}, \delta$, and $\kappa_{2}$ receptor families have been isolated and characterized thus far. One plausible explanation is that $\mu$-receptor subtypes arise from alternate splice variants of a common gene. Since an opioid drug may function with different potencies as an agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist at more than one receptor class or subtype, it is not surprising that these agents are capable of diverse pharmacologic effects. The N/OFQ-ORL1 receptor has not been as extensively studied.

\section*{Cellular Actions}

At the molecular level, opioid receptors form a family of proteins that physically couple to G proteins and
through this interaction affect ion channel gating, modulate intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ disposition, and alter protein phosphorylation (see Chapter 2). The opioids have two well-established direct G protein-coupled actions on neurons: (1) they close voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels on presynaptic nerve terminals and thereby reduce transmitter release, and (2) they hyperpolarize and thus inhibit postsynaptic neurons by opening $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels. Figure 31-1 schematically illustrates the presynaptic action at all three receptor types and the postsynaptic effect at $\mu$ receptors on nociceptive afferents in the spinal cord. The presynaptic action-depressed transmitter release-has been demonstrated for release of a large number of neurotransmitters including glutamate, the principle excitatory amino acid released from nociceptive nerve terminals, as well as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and substance P.

Spinal sites of action of opioids and some other analgesic agents. Mu ( $\mu$ ), delta ( $\delta$ ), and kappa (火) agonists reduce transmitter release (often glutamate and excitatory neuropeptides) from presynaptic terminals of nociceptive primary afferents (cell body omitted). Mu agonists also hyperpolarize second-order pain transmission neurons by increasing $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ conductance, evoking an inhibitory postsynaptic potential. Alpha ${ }_{2}$ agonists appear to act on adrenoceptors on the presynaptic terminal of the primary afferent neuron and ziconotide may act by blocking the calcium channels on this structure (see text).

\section*{Relation of Physiologic Effects to Receptor Type}

The majority of currently available opioid analgesics act primarily at the $\mu$ opioid receptor. Analgesia, as well as the euphoriant, respiratory depressant, and physical dependence properties of morphine result principally from actions at $\mu$ receptors. In fact, the $\mu$ receptor was originally defined using the relative potencies for clinical analgesia of a series of opioid alkaloids. However, opioid analgesic effects are complex and include interaction with $\delta$ and kreceptors. This is supported by the study of genetic knockouts of the $\mu$, $\delta$, and kgenes in mice. Delta-receptor agonists retain analgesic properties in $\mu$ receptor knockout mice. The development of $\delta$-receptor-selective agonists could be clinically useful if their side-effect profiles (respiratory depression, risk of dependence) were more favorable than those found with current $\mu$-receptor agonists, such as morphine. Although morphine does act at kand $\delta$ receptor sites, it is unclear to what extent this contributes to its analgesic action. The endogenous opioid peptides differ from most of the alkaloids in their affinity for the $\delta$ and kreceptors (Table 31-1).

In an effort to develop opioid analgesics with a reduced incidence of respiratory depression or propensity for addiction and dependence, compounds that show preference for kopioid receptors have been developed. Butorphanol and nalbuphine have shown some clinical success as analgesics, but they can cause dysphoric reactions and have limited potency. It is interesting that butorphanol has also been shown to cause significantly greater analgesia in women than in men. The reason for this difference is not known.

\section*{Receptor Distribution and Neural Mechanisms of Analgesia}

Opioid receptor binding sites have been localized autoradiographically with high-affinity radioligands and with antibodies to unique peptide sequences in each receptor subtype. All three major receptors are present in high concentrations in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Receptors are present both on spinal cord pain transmission neurons and on the primary afferents that relay the pain message to them (Figure 31-2, sites A and B). Opioid agonists inhibit the release of excitatory transmitters from these primary afferents, and they directly inhibit the dorsal horn pain transmission neuron. Thus, opioids exert a powerful analgesic effect directly on the spinal cord. This spinal action has been exploited clinically by direct application of opioid agonists to the spinal cord, which provides a regional analgesic effect while reducing the unwanted respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, and sedation that may occur from the supraspinal actions of systemically administered opioids.

A: Direct action of opioids on inflamed or damaged peripheral tissues (see Figure 31-1 for detail). B: Inhibition also occurs in the spinal cord. C: Possible sites of action in the thalamus.

Under most circumstances, opioids are given systemically and so act simultaneously at multiple sites. These include not only the ascending pathways of pain transmission beginning with specialized peripheral sensory terminals that transduce painful stimuli (Figure 31-2) but also descending (modulatory) pathways (Figure 31-3). At these sites as at others, opioids directly inhibit neurons; yet this action results in the activation of descending inhibitory neurons that send processes to the spinal cord and inhibit pain transmission neurons. This activation has been shown to result from the inhibition of inhibitory neurons in several locations (Figure 31-4). Taken together, interactions at these sites increase the overall analgesic effect of opioid agonists.
Figure 31-3.

Brainstem local circuitry underlying the modulating effect of descending pathways by $\mu$ opioid receptor (MOR)-mediated analgesia. The pain inhibitory neuron is indirectly activated by opioids (exogenous or endogenous) that inhibit an inhibitory (GABAergic) interneuron. This results in enhanced inhibition of nociceptive processing in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.

Opioid analgesic action on the descending inhibitory pathway. Sites of action of opioids on pain-modulating neurons in the midbrain and medulla including the midbrain periaqueductal gray area (A), rostral ventral medulla (B), and the locus caeruleus indirectly control pain transmission pathways by enhancing descending inhibition to the dorsal horn (C).

When pain-relieving opioid drugs are given systemically, they presumably act upon brain circuits normally regulated by endogenous opioid peptides. Part of the pain-relieving action of exogenous opioids involves the release of endogenous opioid peptides. An exogenous opioid agonist (eg, morphine) may act primarily and directly at the $\mu$ receptor, but this action may evoke the release of endogenous opioids that additionally act at $\delta$ and kreceptors. Thus, even a receptor-selective ligand can initiate a complex sequence of events involving multiple synapses, transmitters, and receptor types.

Animal and human clinical studies demonstrate that both endogenous and exogenous opioids can also produce opioid-mediated analgesia at sites outside the CNS. Pain associated with inflammation seems especially sensitive to these peripheral opioid actions. The identification of functional $\mu$ receptors on the peripheral terminals of sensory neurons supports this hypothesis. Furthermore, activation of peripheral $\mu$. receptors results in a decrease in sensory neuron activity and transmitter release. Peripheral administration
of opioids, eg, into the knees of patients following arthroscopic knee surgery, has shown clinical benefit up to 24 hours after administration. If they can be developed, opioids selective for a peripheral site would be useful adjuncts in the treatment of inflammatory pain (see I on Channels \& Novel Analgesic Targets). Moreover, new peripherally acting dynorphins may provide a novel means to treat visceral pain. Such compounds could have the additional benefit of reducing unwanted effects such as constipation.

\section*{ION CHANNELS \& NOVEL ANALGESI A TARGETS}

Even the most severe acute pain (lasting hours to days) can usually be well controlled-with significant but tolerable adverse effects—with currently available analgesics, especially the opioids. Chronic pain (lasting weeks to months), however, is not very satisfactorily managed with opioids. It is now known that in chronic pain, presynaptic receptors on sensory nerve terminals in the periphery contribute to increased excitability of sensory nerve endings (peripheral sensitization). The hyperexcitable sensory neuron bombards the spinal cord, leading to increased excitability and synaptic alterations in the dorsal horn (central sensitization). Such changes appear to be important in chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain states.

In the effort to discover better analgesic drugs for chronic pain, renewed attention is being paid to synaptic transmission in nociception and peripheral sensory transduction. Potentially important ion channels associated with these processes in the periphery include members of the transient receptor potential family such as the capsaicin receptor, TRPV1 (which is activated by multiple noxious stimuli such as heat, mechanical injury, protons, and products of inflammation) as well as P2X receptors (which are responsive to purines released from tissue damage). A special type of tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.8), also known as the PN3/SNS channel, is apparently uniquely associated with nociceptive neurons in dorsal root ganglia. Lidocaine andmexiletine, which are useful in some chronic pain states, may act by blocking this channel. Given the importance of their peripheral sites of action, therapeutic strategies that deliver agents that block peripheral pain transduction or transmission have been introduced in the form of transdermal patches and balms. Such products that specifically target peripheral capsaicin receptors and sodium channel function are becoming available.

Ziconotide, a blocker of voltage-gated N-type calcium channels, has recently been approved for intrathecal analgesia in patients with refractory chronic pain. It is a synthetic peptide related to the marine snail toxin 0 -conotoxin, which selectively blocks these calcium channels. Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant analog of GABA (see Chapter 24), is an effective treatment for neuropathic (nerve injury) pain. It has recently been shown to block the pain and hyperalgesia associated with inflammation. Potential sites of action of gabapentin include the $a_{2} \delta$ family of calcium channels.

N -methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA) receptors appear to play a very important role in central sensitization at both spinal and supraspinal levels. Although certain NMDA antagonists have demonstrated analgesic activity (eg, ketamine ), it has been difficult to find agents with an acceptably low profile of adverse effects or neurotoxicity. However, ketamine at very small doses appears to improve analgesia and reduce opioid requirements under conditions of opioid tolerance. GABA and acetylcholine (through nicotinic receptors) appear to control the central synaptic release of several transmitters involved in nociception. Nicotine itself and certain nicotine analogs cause analgesia, and their use for postoperative analgesia is under investigation. Finally, work on cannabinoids and vanilloids and their receptors suggest that $\Delta^{\mathbf{9}}$ tetrahydrocannabinol, which acts primarily on CB1 cannabinoid receptors, can interact with the TRPV1 capsaicin receptor to produce analgesia under certain circumstances.

As our understanding of peripheral and central pain transduction improves, additional therapeutic targets and strategies will become available. Combined with our present knowledge of opioid analgesics, a "multimodal" approach to pain therapy is emerging, which allows the use of complementary compounds resulting in improved analgesia with fewer adverse effects.

\section*{Tolerance and Physical Dependence}

With frequently repeated therapeutic doses of morphine or its surrogates, there is a gradual loss in effectiveness, ie, tolerance. To reproduce the original response, a larger dose must be administered. Along with tolerance, physical dependence develops. Physical dependence is defined as a characteristic withdrawal or abstinence syndrome when a drug is stopped or an antagonist is administered (see also Chapter 32).

The mechanism of development of tolerance and physical dependence is poorly understood, but persistent activation of $\mu$ receptors such as occurs with the treatment of severe chronic pain appears to play a primary role in its induction and maintenance. Current concepts have shifted away from tolerance being driven by a simple up-regulation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) system. Although this process is associated with tolerance, it is not sufficient to explain it. A second hypothesis for tolerance was based on the proposal that repeated exposure to agonist caused $\mu$ receptors to be down-regulated by endocytosis. However, emerging research now implicates the failure of morphine to induce endocytosis of the Hopioid receptor as an important component of tolerance development. This suggests that maintenance of normal sensitivity of $\mu$ receptors requires reactivation by endocytosis and recycling (see Chapter 2). Another area of research suggests that the $\delta$ opioid receptor functions as an independent component in the maintenance of tolerance. In addition, the concept of receptor uncoupling has gained prominence. Under this hypothesis, tolerance is due to a dysfunction of structural interactions between the $\mu$ receptor and G proteins, secondmessenger systems, and their target ion channels. Moreover, a particular ion channel complex, the NMDA receptor, has been shown to play a critical role in tolerance development and maintenance because NMDAreceptor antagonists such as ketamine can block tolerance development. The development of novel NMDAreceptor antagonists or other strategies to recouple $\mu$.receptors to their target ion channels provides hope for achieving a clinically effective means to prevent or reverse opioid analgesic tolerance.

In addition to the development of tolerance, persistent administration of opioid analgesics has been observed to increase the sensation of pain leading to a state of hyperalgesia. This phenomenon has been observed with several opioid analgesics, including morphine, fentanyl, and remifentanyl. Spinal dynorphin has emerged as one important candidate for the mediation of opioid-induced pain and hyperalgesia.

\section*{ORGAN SYSTEM EFFECTS OF MORPHINE AND ITS SURROGATES}

The actions described below for morphine, the prototypic opioid agonist, can also be observed with other opioid agonists, partial agonists, and those with mixed receptor effects. Characteristics of specific members of these groups are discussed below.

\section*{Central Nervous System Effects}

The principal effects of opioid analgesics with affinity for $\mu$ receptors are on the CNS; the more important ones include analgesia, euphoria, sedation, and respiratory depression. With repeated use, a high degree of tolerance occurs to all of these effects (Table 31-3).

\section*{ANALGESI A}

Pain consists of both sensory and affective (emotional) components. Opioid analgesics are unique in that they can reduce both aspects of the pain experience, especially the affective aspect.

\section*{EUPHORIA}

Typically, patients or intravenous drug users who receive intravenous morphine experience a pleasant
floating sensation with lessened anxiety and distress. However, dysphoria, an unpleasant state characterized by restlessness and malaise, may sometimes occur.

\section*{SEDATION}

Drowsiness and clouding of mentation are common concomitants of opioid action. There is little or no amnesia. Sleep is induced by opioids more frequently in the elderly than in young, healthy individuals. Ordinarily, the patient can be easily aroused from this sleep. However, the combination of morphine with other central depressant drugs such as the sedative-hypnotics may result in very deep sleep. Marked sedation occurs more frequently with compounds closely related to the phenanthrene derivatives and less frequently with the synthetic agents such as meperidine and fentanyl. In standard analgesic doses, morphine (a phenanthrene) disrupts normal REM and non-REM sleep patterns. This disrupting effect is probably characteristic of all opioids. In contrast to humans, a number of species (cats, horses, cows, pigs) may manifest excitation rather than sedation when given opioids. These paradoxic effects are at least partially dose-dependent.

\section*{RESPI RATORY DEPRESSI ON}

All of the opioid analgesics can produce significant respiratory depression by inhibiting brainstem respiratory mechanisms. Alveolar P co 2 may increase, but the most reliable indicator of this depression is a depressed response to a carbon dioxide challenge. The respiratory depression is dose-related and is influenced significantly by the degree of sensory input occurring at the time. For example, it is possible to partially overcome opioid-induced respiratory depression by stimulation of various sorts. When strongly painful stimuli that have prevented the depressant action of a large dose of an opioid are relieved, respiratory depression may suddenly become marked. A small to moderate decrease in respiratory function, as measured by Pa CO 2 elevation, may be well tolerated in the patient without prior respiratory impairment. However, in individuals with increased intracranial pressure, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cor pulmonale, this decrease in respiratory function may not be tolerated. Opioidinduced respiratory depression remains one of the most difficult clinical challenges in the treatment of severe pain. Research is ongoing to understand and develop analgesic agents and adjuncts that avoid this effect. Research to overcome this problem is focused on $\delta$ receptor pharmacology and serotonin signaling pathways in the brainstem respiratory control centers.

\section*{COUGH SUPPRESSION}

Suppression of the cough reflex is a well-recognized action of opioids. Codeine in particular has been used to advantage in persons suffering from pathologic cough and in patients in whom it is necessary to maintain ventilation via an endotracheal tube. However, cough suppression by opioids may allow accumulation of secretions and thus lead to airway obstruction and atelectasis.

\section*{MIOSIS}

Constriction of the pupils is seen with virtually all opioid agonists. Miosis is a pharmacologic action to which little or no tolerance develops (Table 31-3); thus, it is valuable in the diagnosis of opioid overdose. Even in highly tolerant addicts, miosis is seen. This action, which can be blocked by opioid antagonists, is mediated by parasympathetic pathways, which, in turn, can be blocked by atropine.

\section*{TRUNCAL RIGIDITY}

An intensification of tone in the large trunk muscles has been noted with a number of opioids. It was originally believed that truncal rigidity involved a spinal cord action of these drugs, but there is now evidence that it results from an action at supraspinal levels. Truncal rigidity reduces thoracic compliance
and thus interferes with ventilation. The effect is most apparent when high doses of the highly lipid-soluble opioids (eg, fentanyl, sufentanil, alfentanil, remifentanil) are rapidly administered intravenously. Truncal rigidity may be overcome by administration of an opioid antagonist, which of course will also antagonize the analgesic action of the opioid. Preventing truncal rigidity while preserving analgesia requires the concomitant use of neuromuscular blocking agents.

\section*{NAUSEA AND VOMI TI NG}

The opioid analgesics can activate the brainstem chemoreceptor trigger zone to produce nausea and vomiting. There may also be a vestibular component in this effect because ambulation seems to increase the incidence of nausea and vomiting.

\section*{Temperature}

Homeostatic regulation of body temperature is mediated in part by the action of endogenous opioid peptides in the brain. This has been supported by experiments demonstrating that $\mu$-opioid receptor agonists such as morphine administered to the anterior hypothalamus produces hyperthermia, whereas administration of kagonists induce hypothermia.

\section*{Peripheral Effects}

\section*{CARDI OVASCULAR SYSTEM}

Most opioids have no significant direct effects on the heart and, other than bradycardia, no major effects on cardiac rhythm. Meperidine is an exception to this generalization because its antimuscarinic action can result in tachycardia. Blood pressure is usually well maintained in subjects receiving opioids unless the cardiovascular system is stressed, in which case hypotension may occur. This hypotensive effect is probably due to peripheral arterial and venous dilation, which has been attributed to a number of mechanisms including central depression of vasomotor-stabilizing mechanisms and release of histamine. No consistent effect on cardiac output is seen, and the electrocardiogram is not significantly affected. However, caution should be exercised in patients with decreased blood volume, because the above mechanisms make these patients susceptible to hypotension. Opioid analgesics affect cerebral circulation minimally except when P CO 2 rises as a consequence of respiratory depression. Increased P CO 2 leads to cerebral vasodilation associated with a decrease in cerebral vascular resistance, an increase in cerebral blood flow, and an increase in intracranial pressure.

\section*{GASTROI NTESTI NAL TRACT}

Constipation has long been recognized as an effect of opioids, an effect that does not diminish with continued use; that is, tolerance does not develop to opioid-induced constipation (Table 31-3). Opioid receptors exist in high density in the gastrointestinal tract, and the constipating effects of the opioids are mediated through an action on the enteric nervous system (see Chapter 6) as well as the CNS. In the stomach, motility (rhythmic contraction and relaxation) may decrease but tone (persistent contraction) may increase-particularly in the central portion; gastric secretion of hydrochloric acid is decreased. Small intestine resting tone is increased, with periodic spasms, but the amplitude of nonpropulsive contractions is markedly decreased. In the large intestine, propulsive peristaltic waves are diminished and tone is increased; this delays passage of the fecal mass and allows increased absorption of water, which leads to constipation. The large bowel actions are the basis for the use of opioids in the management of diarrhea.

\section*{BILIARY TRACT}

The opioids contract biliary smooth muscle, which can result in biliary colic. The sphincter of Oddi may constrict, resulting in reflux of biliary and pancreatic secretions and elevated plasma amylase and lipase
levels.

\section*{RENAL}

Renal function is depressed by opioids. It is believed that in humans this is chiefly due to decreased renal plasma flow. In addition, Hopioids have been found to have an antidiuretic effect in humans. Mechanisms may involve both the CNS and peripheral sites. Opioids also enhance renal tubular sodium reabsorption. The role of opioid-induced changes in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release is controversial. Ureteral and bladder tone are increased by therapeutic doses of the opioid analgesics. Increased sphincter tone may precipitate urinary retention, especially in postoperative patients. Occasionally, ureteral colic caused by a renal calculus is made worse by opioid-induced increase in ureteral tone.

\section*{UTERUS}

The opioid analgesics may prolong labor. The mechanism for this action is unclear, but both peripheral and central actions of the opioids can reduce uterine tone.

\section*{NEUROENDOCRINE}

Opioid analgesics stimulate the release of ADH, prolactin, and somatotropin but inhibit the release of luteinizing hormone. These effects suggest that endogenous opioid peptides, through effects in the hypothalamus, regulate these systems (Table 31-1).

\section*{PRURITUS}

Therapeutic doses of the opioid analgesics produce flushing and warming of the skin accompanied sometimes by sweating and itching; CNS effects and peripheral histamine release may be responsible for these reactions. Opioid-induced pruritus and occasionally urticaria appear more frequently when opioid analgesics are administered parenterally. In addition, when opioids such as morphine are administered to the neuraxis by the spinal or epidural route, their usefulness may be limited by intense pruritus over the lips and torso.

\section*{MI SCELLANEOUS}

The opioids modulate the immune system by effects on lymphocyte proliferation, antibody production, and chemotaxis. Natural killer cell cytolytic activity and lymphocyte proliferative responses to mitogens are usually inhibited by opioids. Although the mechanisms involved are complex, activation of central opioid receptors could mediate a significant component of the changes observed in peripheral immune function. In general, these effects are mediated by the sympathetic nervous system in the case of acute administration and by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system in the case of prolonged administration of opioids.

\section*{EFFECTS OF OPIOIDS WITH BOTH AGONIST AND ANTAGONIST ACTIONS}

Buprenorphine is an opioid agonist that displays high binding affinity but low intrinsic activity at the $\mu$. receptor. Its slow rate of dissociation from the $\mu$ receptor has also made it an attractive alternative to methadone for the management of opioid withdrawal. It functions as an antagonist at the $\delta$ and kreceptors and for this reason is referred to as a "mixed agonist-antagonist." Although buprenorphine is used as an analgesic, it can antagonize the action of more potent $\mu$ agonists such as morphine. Buprenorphine also binds to ORL1, the orphanin receptor. Whether this property also participates in opposing $\mu$ receptor function is under study. Pentazocine and nalbuphine are other examples of opioid analgesics with mixed agonist-antagonist properties. Psychotomimetic effects, with hallucinations, nightmares, and anxiety, have been reported after use of drugs with mixed agonist-antagonist actions.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF THE OPIOID ANALGESICS}

Successful treatment of pain is a challenging task that begins with careful attempts to assess the source and magnitude of the pain. The amount of pain experienced by the patient is often measured by means of a numeric visual analog scale (VAS) with word descriptors ranging from no pain (0) to excruciating pain (10). A similar scale can be used with children and with patients who cannot speak; this scale depicts five faces ranging from smiling (no pain) to crying (maximum pain).

For a patient in severe pain, the administration of an opioid analgesic is usually considered a primary part of the overall management plan. Determining the route of administration (oral, parenteral, neuraxial), duration of drug action, ceiling effect (maximal intrinsic activity), duration of therapy, potential for adverse effects, and the patient's past experience with opioids all should be addressed. One of the principal errors made by physicians in this setting is failure to adequately assess a patient's pain and to match its severity with an appropriate level of therapy. Just as important is the principle that following delivery of the therapeutic plan, its effectiveness must be reevaluated and the plan modified, if necessary, if the response was excessive or inadequate.

Use of opioid drugs in acute situations may be contrasted with their use in chronic pain management, in which a multitude of other factors must be considered, including the development of tolerance to and physical dependence on opioid analgesics.

\section*{Clinical Use of Opioid Analgesics}

\section*{ANALGESIA}

Severe, constant pain is usually relieved with opioid analgesics with high intrinsic activity (see Table 31-2); whereas sharp, intermittent pain does not appear to be as effectively controlled.

The pain associated with cancer and other terminal illnesses must be treated aggressively and often requires a multidisciplinary approach for effective management. Such conditions may require continuous use of potent opioid analgesics and are associated with some degree of tolerance and dependence. However, this should not be used as a barrier to providing patients with the best possible care and quality of life. Research in the hospice movement has demonstrated that fixed-interval administration of opioid medication (ie, a regular dose at a scheduled time) is more effective in achieving pain relief than dosing on demand. New dosage forms of opioids that allow slower release of the drug are now available, eg, sustained-release forms of morphine (MSContin) and oxycodone (OxyContin). Their purported advantage is a longer and more stable level of analgesia.

If disturbances of gastrointestinal function prevent the use of oral sustained-release morphine, the fentanyl transdermal system (fentanyl patch) can be used over long periods. Furthermore, buccal transmucosal fentanyl can be used for episodes of breakthrough pain (see Alternative Routes of Administration). Administration of strong opioids by nasal insufflation has been shown to be efficacious, and nasal preparations are now available in some countries. Approval of such formulations in the USA is growing. In addition, stimulant drugs such as the amphetamines have been shown to enhance the analgesic actions of the opioids and thus may be very useful adjuncts in the patient with chronic pain.

Opioid analgesics are often used during obstetric labor. Because opioids cross the placental barrier and reach the fetus, care must be taken to minimize neonatal depression. If it occurs, immediate injection of the antagonist naloxone will reverse the depression. The phenylpiperidine drugs (eg, meperidine) appear to produce less depression, particularly respiratory depression, in newborn infants than does morphine; this may justify their use in obstetric practice.

The acute, severe pain of renal and biliary colic often requires a strong agonist opioid for adequate relief. However, the drug-induced increase in smooth muscle tone may cause a paradoxical increase in pain secondary to increased spasm. An increase in the dose of opioid is usually successful in providing adequate analgesia.

\section*{ACUTE PULMONARY EDEMA}

The relief produced by intravenous morphine in dyspnea from pulmonary edema associated with left ventricular failure is remarkable. Proposed mechanisms include reduced anxiety (perception of shortness of breath), and reduced cardiac preload (reduced venous tone) and afterload (decreased peripheral resistance). Morphine can be particularly useful when treating painful myocardial ischemia with pulmonary edema.

\section*{COUGH}

Suppression of cough can be obtained at doses lower than those needed for analgesia. However, in recent years the use of opioid analgesics to allay cough has diminished largely because a number of effective synthetic compounds have been developed that are neither analgesic nor addictive. These agents are discussed below.

\section*{DI ARRHEA}

Diarrhea from almost any cause can be controlled with the opioid analgesics, but if diarrhea is associated with infection such use must not substitute for appropriate chemotherapy. Crude opium preparations (eg, paregoric) were used in the past to control diarrhea, but now synthetic surrogates with more selective gastrointestinal effects and few or no CNS effects, eg, diphenoxylate, are used. Several preparations are available specifically for this purpose (Chapter 63).

\section*{SHIVERING}

Although all opioid agonists have some propensity to reduce shivering, meperidine is reported to have the most pronounced anti-shivering properties. It is interesting that meperidine apparently blocks shivering through its action on subtypes of the $\alpha_{2}$ adrenoceptor.

\section*{APPLICATIONS IN ANESTHESIA}

The opioids are frequently used as premedicant drugs before anesthesia and surgery because of their sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic properties. They are also used intraoperatively both as adjuncts to other anesthetic agents and, in high doses (eg, $0.02-0.075 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ of fentanyl), as a primary component of the anesthetic regimen (see Chapter 25). Opioids are most commonly used in cardiovascular surgery and other types of high-risk surgery in which a primary goal is to minimize cardiovascular depression. In such situations, mechanical respiratory assistance must be provided.

Because of their direct action on the superficial neurons of the spinal cord dorsal horn, opioids can also be used as regional analgesics by administration into the epidural or subarachnoid spaces of the spinal column. A number of studies have demonstrated that long-lasting analgesia with minimal adverse effects can be achieved by epidural administration of $3-5 \mathrm{mg}$ of morphine, followed by slow infusion through a catheter placed in the epidural space. It was initially assumed that the epidural application of opioids might selectively produce analgesia without impairment of motor, autonomic, or sensory functions other than pain. However, respiratory depression can occur after the drug is injected into the epidural space and may require reversal with naloxone. Effects such as pruritus and nausea and vomiting are common after epidural and subarachnoid administration of opioids and may also be reversed with naloxone if necessary.

Currently, the epidural route is favored because adverse effects are less common. Morphine is the most frequently used agent, but the use of low doses of local anesthetics in combination with fentanyl infused through a thoracic epidural catheter has also become an accepted method of pain control in patients recovering from major upper abdominal surgery. In rare cases, chronic pain management specialists may elect to surgically implant a programmable infusion pump connected to a spinal catheter for continuous infusion of opioids or other analgesic compounds.

\section*{ALTERNATIVE ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION}

Rectal suppositories of morphine and hydromorphone have long been used when oral and parenteral routes are undesirable. The transdermal patch provides stable blood levels of drug and better pain control while avoiding the need for repeated parenteral injections. Fentanyl has been the most successful opioid in transdermal application and finds great use in patients experiencing chronic pain. The intranasal route avoids repeated parenteral drug injections and the first-pass metabolism of orally administered drugs. Butorphanol is the only opioid currently available in the USA in a nasal formulation, but more are expected. Another alternative to parenteral administration is the buccal transmucosal route, which uses a fentanyl citrate lozenge or a "lollipop" mounted on a stick.

Another type of pain control called patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is now in widespread use for the management of breakthrough pain. With PCA, the patient controls a parenteral (usually intravenous) infusion device by depressing a button to deliver a preprogrammed dose of the desired opioid analgesic. Claims of better pain control using less opioid are supported by well-designed clinical trials, making this approach very useful in postoperative pain control. However, health care personnel must be very familiar with the use of PCAs to avoid overdosage secondary to misuse or improper programming. There is a proven risk of respiratory depression with hypoxia that requires careful monitoring of vital signs and sedation level.

\section*{Toxicity \& Undesired Effects}

Direct toxic effects of the opioid analgesics that are extensions of their acute pharmacologic actions include respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, and constipation (Table 31-4). In addition, tolerance and dependence, diagnosis and treatment of overdosage, as well as contraindications must be considered.
Table 31-4. Adverse Effects of the Opioid Analgesics.

Behavioral restlessness, tremulousness, hyperactivity (in dysphoric reactions)
Respiratory depression
Nausea and vomiting
Increased intracranial pressure
Postural hypotension accentuated by hypovolemia
Constipation
Urinary retention
Itching around nose, urticaria (more frequent with parenteral and spinal administration)

\section*{TOLERANCE AND DEPENDENCE}

Drug dependence of the opioid type is marked by a relatively specific withdrawal or abstinence syndrome. Just as there are pharmacologic differences between the various opioids, there are also differences in psychologic dependence and the severity of withdrawal effects. For example, withdrawal from dependence on a strong agonist is associated with more severe withdrawal signs and symptoms than withdrawal from a mild or moderate agonist. Administration of an opioid antagonist to an opioid-dependent person is followed by brief but severe withdrawal symptoms (see antagonist-precipitated withdrawal, below). The potential for physical and psychologic dependence of the partial agonist-antagonist opioids appears to be less than that of the agonist drugs.

\section*{Tolerance}

Although development of tolerance begins with the first dose of an opioid, tolerance generally does not become clinically manifest until after 2-3 weeks of frequent exposure to ordinary therapeutic doses. Tolerance develops most readily when large doses are given at short intervals and is minimized by giving small amounts of drug with longer intervals between doses.

Depending on the compound and the effect measured, the degree of tolerance may be as great as 35 -fold. Marked tolerance may develop to the analgesic, sedating, and respiratory depressant effects. It is possible to produce respiratory arrest in a nontolerant person with a dose of 60 mg of morphine, whereas in addicts maximally tolerant to opioids as much as 2000 mg of morphine taken over a 2- or 3-hour period may not produce significant respiratory depression. Tolerance also develops to the antidiuretic, emetic, and hypotensive effects but not to the miotic, convulsant, and constipating actions (Table 31-3).

Tolerance to the sedating and respiratory effects of the opioids dissipates within a few days after the drugs are discontinued. Tolerance to the emetic effects may persist for several months after withdrawal of the drug. The rates at which tolerance appears and disappears, as well as the degree of tolerance, may also differ considerably among the different opioid analgesics and among individuals using the same drug. For instance, tolerance to methadone develops more slowly and to a lesser degree than to morphine.

Tolerance also develops to analgesics with mixed receptor effects but to a lesser extent than to the agonists. Such effects as hallucinations, sedation, hypothermia, and respiratory depression are reduced after repeated administration of the mixed receptor drugs. However, tolerance to the latter agents does not generally include cross-tolerance to the agonist opioids. It is also important to note that tolerance does not develop to the antagonist actions of the mixed agents or to those of the pure antagonists.

Cross-tolerance is an extremely important characteristic of the opioids, ie, patients tolerant to morphine show a reduction in analgesic response to other agonist opioids. This is particularly true of those agents with primarily $\mu$-receptor agonist activity. Morphine and its congeners exhibit cross-tolerance not only with respect to their analgesic actions but also to their euphoriant, sedative, and respiratory effects. However, the cross-tolerance existing among the $\mu$-receptor agonists can often be partial or incomplete. This clinical observation has led to the concept of "opioid rotation," which has been used in the treatment of cancer pain for many years. A patient who is experiencing decreasing effectiveness of one opioid analgesic regimen is "rotated" to a different opioid analgesic (eg, morphine to hydromorphone; hydromorphone to methadone) and typically experiences significantly improved analgesia at a reduced overall equivalent dosage. Another approach is to "recouple" opioid receptor function through the use of adjunctive nonopioid agents. NMDAreceptor antagonists (eg, ketamine) have shown promise in preventing or reversing opioid-induced tolerance in animals and humans. Use of these agents, especially ketamine, is increasing because wellcontrolled studies have shown clinical effectiveness in reducing postoperative pain and opioid requirements
in opioid-tolerant patients.
The novel use of $\delta$-receptor antagonists with $\mu$-receptor agonists is also emerging as a strategy to avoid the development of tolerance. This idea has developed around the observation that mice lacking the $\delta$ opioid receptor fail to develop tolerance to morphine.

\section*{Physical Dependence}

The development of physical dependence is an invariable accompaniment of tolerance to repeated administration of an opioid of the $\mu$.type. Failure to continue administering the drug results in a characteristic withdrawal or abstinence syndrome that reflects an exaggerated rebound from the acute pharmacologic effects of the opioid.

The signs and symptoms of withdrawal include rhinorrhea, lacrimation, yawning, chills, gooseflesh (piloerection), hyperventilation, hyperthermia, mydriasis, muscular aches, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, and hostility (see Chapter 32). The number and intensity of the signs and symptoms are largely dependent on the degree of physical dependence that has developed. Administration of an opioid at this time suppresses abstinence signs and symptoms almost immediately.

The time of onset, intensity, and duration of abstinence syndrome depend on the drug previously used and may be related to its biologic half-life. With morphine or heroin, withdrawal signs usually start within 6-10 hours after the last dose. Peak effects are seen at 36-48 hours, after which most of the signs and symptoms gradually subside. By 5 days, most of the effects have disappeared, but some may persist for months. In the case of meperidine, the withdrawal syndrome largely subsides within 24 hours, whereas with methadone several days are required to reach the peak of the abstinence syndrome, and it may last as long as 2 weeks. The slower subsidence of methadone effects is associated with a less intense immediate syndrome, and this is the basis for its use in the detoxification of heroin addicts. After the abstinence syndrome subsides, tolerance also disappears, as evidenced by a restoration in sensitivity to the opioid agonist. However, despite the loss of physical dependence on the opioid, craving for it may persist for many months.

A transient, explosive abstinence syndrome-antagonist-precipitated withdrawal -can be induced in a subject physically dependent on opioids by administering naloxone or another antagonist. Within 3 minutes after injection of the antagonist, signs and symptoms similar to those seen after abrupt discontinuance appear, peaking in 10-20 minutes and largely subsiding after 1 hour. Even in the case of methadone, withdrawal of which results in a relatively mild abstinence syndrome, the antagonist-precipitated abstinence syndrome may be very severe.

In the case of agents with mixed effects, withdrawal signs and symptoms can be induced after repeated administration followed by abrupt discontinuance of pentazocine, cyclazocine, or nalorphine, but the syndrome appears to be somewhat different from that produced by morphine and other agonists. Anxiety, loss of appetite and body weight, tachycardia, chills, increase in body temperature, and abdominal cramps have been noted.

\section*{Psychologic Dependence}

The euphoria, indifference to stimuli, and sedation usually caused by the opioid analgesics, especially when injected intravenously, tend to promote their compulsive use. In addition, the addict experiences abdominal effects that have been likened to an intense sexual orgasm. These factors constitute the primary reasons for opioid abuse liability and are strongly reinforced by the development of physical dependence.

Obviously, the risk of causing dependence is an important consideration in the therapeutic use of these drugs. Despite that risk, under no circumstances should adequate pain relief ever be withheld simply because an opioid exhibits potential for abuse or because legislative controls complicate the process of prescribing narcotics. Furthermore, certain principles can be observed by the clinician to minimize problems presented by tolerance and dependence when using opioid analgesics:

Establish therapeutic goals before starting opioid therapy. This tends to limit the potential for physical dependence. The patient and his or her family should be included in this process.

Once a therapeutic dose is established, attempt to limit dosage to this level. This goal is facilitated by use of a written treatment contract which specifically prohibits early refills and having multiple prescribing physicians.

Instead of opioid analgesics-especially in chronic management-consider using other types of analgesics or compounds exhibiting less pronounced withdrawal symptoms on discontinuance.

Frequently evaluate continuing analgesic therapy and the patient's need for opioids.

\section*{DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF OPIOID OVERDOSAGE}

Intravenous injection of naloxone dramatically reverses coma due to opioid overdose but not that due to other CNS depressants. Use of the antagonist should not, of course, delay the institution of other therapeutic measures, especially respiratory support.

See also the Opioid Antagonists section below and Chapter 59.

\section*{CONTRAI NDICATIONS AND CAUTIONS IN THERAPY}

\section*{Use of Pure Agonists with Weak Partial Agonists}

When a weak partial agonist such as pentazocine is given to a patient also receiving a full agonist (eg, morphine), there is a risk of diminishing analgesia or even inducing a state of withdrawal; combining full agonist with partial agonist opioids should be avoided.

\section*{Use in Patients with Head Injuries}

Carbon dioxide retention caused by respiratory depression results in cerebral vasodilation. In patients with elevated intracranial pressure, this may lead to lethal alterations in brain function.

\section*{Use during Pregnancy}

In pregnant women who are chronically using opioids, the fetus may become physically dependent in utero and manifest withdrawal symptoms in the early postpartum period. A daily dose as small as 6 mg of heroin (or equivalent) taken by the mother can result in a mild withdrawal syndrome in the infant, and twice that much may result in severe signs and symptoms, including irritability, shrill crying, diarrhea, or even seizures. Recognition of the problem is aided by a careful history and physical examination. When withdrawal symptoms are judged to be relatively mild, treatment is aimed at control of these symptoms with such drugs as diazepam; with more severe withdrawal, camphorated tincture of opium (paregoric; 0.4 mg of morphine $/ \mathrm{mL}$ ) in an oral dose of $0.12-0.24 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ is used. Oral doses of methadone ( $0.1-0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) have also been used.

\section*{Use in Patients with Impaired Pulmonary Function}

In patients with borderline respiratory reserve, the depressant properties of the opioid analgesics may lead to acute respiratory failure.

\section*{Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic or Renal Function}

Because morphine and its congeners are metabolized primarily in the liver, their use in patients in prehepatic coma may be questioned. Half-life is prolonged in patients with impaired renal function, and morphine and its active glucuronide metabolite may accumulate; dosage can often be reduced in such patients.

\section*{Use in Patients with Endocrine Disease}

Patients with adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) and those with hypothyroidism (myxedema) may have prolonged and exaggerated responses to opioids.

\section*{Drug I nteractions}

Because seriously ill or hospitalized patients may require a large number of drugs, there is always a possibility of drug interactions when the opioid analgesics are administered. Table 31-5 lists some of these drug interactions and the reasons for not combining the named drugs with opioids.

\section*{Specific Agents}

The following section describes the most important and widely used opioid analgesics, along with features peculiar to specific agents. Data about doses approximately equivalent to 10 mg of intramuscular morphine, oral versus parenteral efficacy, duration of analgesia, and intrinsic activity (maximum efficacy) are presented in Table 31-2.

\section*{STRONG AGONI STS}

\section*{Phenanthrenes}

Morphine, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone are strong agonists useful in treating severe pain. These prototypic agents have been described in detail above.

Morphine

Heroin (diamorphine, diacetylmorphine) is potent and fast-acting, but its use is prohibited in the USA and Canada. In recent years, there has been considerable agitation to revive its use. However, double-blind studies have not supported the claim that heroin is more effective than morphine in relieving severe chronic pain, at least when given by the intramuscular route.

\section*{Phenylheptylamines}

Methadone has undergone a dramatic revival as a potent and clinically useful analgesic. It can be administered by the oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, spinal, and rectal routes. It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and its bioavailability far exceeds that of oral morphine.
<smiles>CCC(=O)C(CC(C)N(C)C)(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1</smiles>

\section*{Methadone}

Methadone is not only a potent $\mu$-receptor agonist but its racemic mixture of D - and L-methadone isomers can also block both NMDA receptors and monoaminergic reuptake transporters. These nonopioid receptor properties may help explain its ability to relieve difficult-to-treat pain (neuropathic, cancer pain), especially when a previous trial of morphine has failed. In this regard, when analgesic tolerance or intolerable side effects have developed with the use of increasing doses of morphine or hydromorphone, "opioid rotation" to methadone has provided superior analgesia at 10-20\% of the morphine-equivalent daily dose. In contrast to its use in suppressing symptoms of opioid withdrawal, use of methadone as an analgesic typically requires administration at intervals of no more than 8 hours. However, given methadone's highly variable pharmacokinetics and long half-life (25-52 hours), initial administration should be closely monitored to avoid potentially harmful adverse effects, especially respiratory depression.

Methadone is widely known for its use in the treatment of opioid abuse. Tolerance and physical dependence develop more slowly with methadone than with morphine. The withdrawal signs and symptoms occurring after abrupt discontinuance of methadone are milder, although more prolonged, than those of morphine. These properties make methadone a useful drug for detoxification and for maintenance of the chronic relapsing heroin addict.

For detoxification of a heroin-dependent addict, low doses of methadone ( $5-10 \mathrm{mg}$ orally) are given two or three times daily for 2 or 3 days. Upon discontinuing methadone, the addict experiences a mild but endurable withdrawal syndrome.

For maintenance therapy of the opioid recidivist, tolerance to $50-100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ of oral methadone may be deliberately produced; in this state, the addict experiences cross-tolerance to heroin, which prevents most of the addiction-reinforcing effects of heroin. One rationale of maintenance programs is that blocking the reinforcement obtained from abuse of illicit opioids removes the drive to obtain them, thereby reducing criminal activity and making the addict more amenable to psychiatric and rehabilitative therapy. The pharmacologic basis for the use of methadone in maintenance programs is sound and the sociologic basis is rational, but some methadone programs fail because nonpharmacologic management is inadequate.

The concurrent administration of methadone to heroin addicts known to be recidivists has been questioned because of the increased risk of overdose death secondary to respiratory arrest. Buprenorphine, a partial $\mu$ receptor agonist with long-acting properties, has been found to be effective in opioid detoxification and maintenance programs and is presumably associated with a lower risk of such overdose fatalities.

\section*{Phenylpiperidines}

Fentanyl is one of the most widely used agents in this family of synthetic opioids. The fentanyl subgroup now includes sufentanil, alfentanil, and remifentanil in addition to the parent compound, fentanyl.
<smiles>CCC(=O)N(c1ccccc1)C1CCN(CCc2ccccc2)CC1</smiles>

\section*{Fentanyl}

These opioids differ mainly in their potency and biodisposition. Sufentanil is five to seven times more potent than fentanyl. Alfentanil is considerably less potent than fentanyl, but acts more rapidly and has a markedly shorter duration of action. Remifentanil is metabolized very rapidly by blood and nonspecific tissue esterases, making its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic half-lives extremely short. Such properties are useful when these compounds are used in anesthesia practice. Although fentanyl is now the predominant analgesic in the phenylpiperidine class, meperidine continues to be widely used. This older opioid has significant antimuscarinic effects, which may be a contraindication if tachycardia would be a problem. Meperidine is also reported to have a negative inotropic action on the heart. In addition, it has the potential for producing seizures secondary to accumulation of its metabolite, normeperidine, in patients receiving high doses or with concurrent renal failure.

\section*{Morphinans}

Levorphanol is a synthetic opioid analgesic closely resembling morphine in its action.

\section*{MILD TO MODERATE AGONISTS}

\section*{Phenanthrenes}

Codeine,oxycodone, dihydrocodeine, and hydrocodone are all somewhat less efficacious than
morphine (they are partial agonists) or have adverse effects that limit the maximum tolerated dose when one attempts to achieve analgesia comparable to that of morphine.

Codeine

These compounds are rarely used alone but are combined in formulations containing aspirin or acetaminophen and other drugs.

\section*{Phenylheptylamines}

Propoxyphene is chemically related to methadone but has low analgesic activity. Various studies have reported its potency at levels ranging from no better than placebo to half as potent as codeine; that is, 120 mg propoxyphene $=60 \mathrm{mg}$ codeine. Its true potency probably lies somewhere between these extremes, and its analgesic effect is additive to that of an optimal dose of aspirin. However, its low efficacy makes it unsuitable, even in combination with aspirin, for severe pain. Although propoxyphene has a low abuse liability, the increasing incidence of deaths associated with its misuse has caused it to be scheduled as a controlled substance with low potential for abuse.

\section*{Phenylpiperidines}

Diphenoxylate and its metabolite, difenoxin, are not used for analgesia but for the treatment of diarrhea. They are scheduled for minimal control (difenoxin is schedule IV, diphenoxylate schedule V; see Schedule of Controlled Drugs) because the likelihood of their abuse is remote. The poor solubility of the compounds limits their use for parenteral injection. As antidiarrheal drugs, they are used in combination with atropine. The atropine is added in a concentration too low to have a significant antidiarrheal effect but is presumed to further reduce the likelihood of abuse.

Loperamide is a phenylpiperidine derivative used to control diarrhea. Its potential for abuse is considered very low because of its limited access to the brain. It is therefore available without a prescription.

The usual dose with all of these antidiarrheal agents is two tablets to start and then one tablet after each diarrheal stool.

\section*{OPI OI DS WITH MI XED RECEPTOR ACTI ONS}

Care should be taken not to administer any partial agonist or drug with mixed opioid receptor actions to patients receiving pure agonist drugs because of the unpredictability of both drugs' effects: reduction of analgesia or precipitation of an explosive abstinence syndrome may result.

\section*{Phenanthrenes}

Nalbuphine is a strong kreceptor agonist and a $\mu$ receptor antagonist; it is given parenterally. At higher doses there seems to be a definite ceiling-not noted with morphine-to the respiratory depressant effect. Unfortunately, when respiratory depression does occur, it may be relatively resistant to naloxone reversal.

Buprenorphine is a potent and long-acting phenanthrene derivative that is a partial $\mu$.receptor agonist. When administered orally, the sublingual route is preferred to avoid significant first-pass effect. Its long duration of action is due to its slow dissociation from $\mu$ receptors. This property renders its effects resistant to naloxone reversal. Its clinical applications are much like those of nalbuphine. In addition, studies continue to suggest that buprenorphine is as effective as methadone in the detoxification and maintenance of heroin abusers. Buprenorphine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2002 for the management of opioid dependence. In contrast to methadone, high-dose administration of buprenorphine results in a $\mu$ opioid antagonist action, limiting its properties of analgesia and respiratory depression. Moreover, buprenorphine is also available combined with a pure $\mu$ opioid antagonist to help prevent its diversion for illicit intravenous abuse.

\section*{Morphinans}

Butorphanol produces analgesia equivalent to nalbuphine and buprenorphine but appears to produce more sedation at equianalgesic doses. Butorphanol is considered to be predominantly a kagonist. However, it may also act as a partial agonist or antagonist at the $\mu$-receptor.

\section*{Benzomorphans}

Pentazocine is a kagonist with weak $\mu$-antagonist or partial agonist properties. It is the oldest mixed agent available. It may be used orally or parenterally. However, because of its irritant properties, the injection of pentazocine subcutaneously is not recommended.

\section*{MI SCELLANEOUS}

Tramadol is a centrally acting analgesic whose mechanism of action is predominantly based on blockade of serotonin reuptake. Tramadol has also been found to inhibit norepinephrine transporter function. Because it is only partially antagonized by naloxone, it is believed to be only a weak $\mu$-receptor agonist. The recommended dosage is $50-100 \mathrm{mg}$ orally four times daily. Toxicity includes association with seizures; the drug is relatively contraindicated in patients with a history of epilepsy and for use with other drugs that lower the seizure threshold. Other side effects include nausea and dizziness, but these symptoms typically abate after several days of therapy. It is surprising that no clinically significant effects on respiration or the cardiovascular system have thus far been reported. Given the fact that the analgesic action of tramadol is largely independent of $\mu$.receptor action, tramadol may serve as an adjunct with pure opioid agonists in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.

\section*{ANTITUSSI VES}

The opioid analgesics are among the most effective drugs available for the suppression of cough. This effect is often achieved at doses below those necessary to produce analgesia. The receptors involved in the antitussive effect appear to differ from those associated with the other actions of opioids. For example, the antitussive effect is also produced by stereoisomers of opioid molecules that are devoid of analgesic effects and addiction liability (see below).

The physiologic mechanism of cough is complex, and little is known about the specific mechanism of action of the opioid antitussive drugs. It is likely that both central and peripheral effects play a role.

The opioid derivatives most commonly used as antitussives are dextromethorphan, codeine, levopropoxyphene, and noscapine (levopropoxyphene and noscapine are not available in the USA). Although these agents (other than codeine) are largely free of the adverse effects associated with the
opioids, they should be used with caution in patients taking monoamine oxide inhibitors (see Table 31-5). Antitussive preparations usually also contain expectorants to thin and liquefy respiratory secretions.

Dextromethorphan is the dextrorotatory stereoisomer of a methylated derivative of levorphanol. It is purported to be free of addictive properties and produces less constipation than codeine. The usual antitussive dose is $15-30 \mathrm{mg}$ three or four times daily. It is available in many over-the-counter products. Dextromethorphan has also been found to enhance the analgesic action of morphine and presumably other H-receptor agonists.

Codeine, as noted, has a useful antitussive action at doses lower than those required for analgesia. Thus, 15 mg are usually sufficient to relieve cough.

Levopropoxyphene is the stereoisomer of the weak opioid agonist dextropropoxyphene. It is devoid of opioid effects, although sedation has been described as a side effect. The usual antitussive dose is 50-100 mg every 4 hours.

\section*{THE OPIOID ANTAGONISTS}

The pure opioid antagonist drugs naloxone, naltrexone, and nalmefene are morphine derivatives with bulkier substituents at the $\mathrm{N}_{17}$ position. These agents have a relatively high affinity for $\mu$ opioid binding sites. They have lower affinity for the other receptors but can also reverse agonists at $\delta$ and issites.

\section*{Naloxone}

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Naloxone is usually given by injection and has short duration of action (1-2 hours) when given by this route. Metabolic disposition is chiefly by glucuronide conjugation like that of the agonist opioids with free hydroxyl groups. Naltrexone is well absorbed after oral administration but may undergo rapid first-pass metabolism. It has a half-life of 10 hours, and a single oral dose of 100 mg blocks the effects of injected heroin for up to 48 hours. Nalmefene, the newest of these agents, is a derivative of naltrexone but is available only for intravenous administration. Like naloxone, nalmefene is used for opioid overdose but has a longer half-life (8-10 hours).

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

When given in the absence of an agonist drug, these antagonists are almost inert at doses that produce marked antagonism of agonist opioid effects.

When given intravenously to a morphine-treated subject, the antagonist completely and dramatically reverses the opioid effects within 1-3 minutes. In individuals who are acutely depressed by an overdose of an opioid, the antagonist effectively normalizes respiration, level of consciousness, pupil size, bowel activity, and awareness of pain. In dependent subjects who appear normal while taking opioids, naloxone
or naltrexone almost instantaneously precipitates an abstinence syndrome.
There is no tolerance to the antagonistic action of these agents, nor does withdrawal after chronic administration precipitate an abstinence syndrome.

\section*{Clinical Use}

Naloxone is a pure antagonist and is preferred over older weak agonist-antagonist agents that had been used primarily as antagonists, eg, nalorphine and levallorphan.

The major application of naloxone is in the treatment of acute opioid overdose (see also Chapter 59). It is very important that the relatively short duration of action of naloxone be borne in mind, because a severely depressed patient may recover after a single dose of naloxone and appear normal, only to relapse into coma after 1-2 hours.

The usual initial dose of naloxone is $\mathbf{0 . 1 - 0 . 4 ~ m g}$ intravenously for life-threatening respiratory and CNS depression. Maintenance is with the same drug, $0.4-0.8 \mathrm{mg}$ given intravenously, and repeated whenever necessary. In using naloxone in the severely opioid-depressed newborn, it is important to start with doses of $5-10 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg}$ and to consider a second dose of up to a total of $25 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg}$ if no response is noted.

Low-dose naloxone ( 0.04 mg ) has an increasing role in the treatment of adverse effects that are commonly associated with intravenous or epidural opioids. Careful titration of the naloxone dosage can often eliminate the itching, nausea, and vomiting while sparing the analgesia. Oral naloxone, and more recently developed nonabsorbable analogs of naloxone, have been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of opioid-induced ileus or constipation. The principal mechanism behind this selective therapeutic effect is believed to be local inhibition of $\mu$ receptors in the gut with minimal systemic absorption. Several of these compounds are in the final stages of evaluation by the FDA.

Because of its long duration of action, naltrexone has been proposed as a maintenance drug for addicts in treatment programs. A single dose given on alternate days blocks virtually all of the effects of a dose of heroin. It might be predicted that this approach to rehabilitation would not be popular with a large percentage of drug users unless they are motivated to become drug-free. There is evidence that naltrexone decreases the craving for alcohol in chronic alcoholics, and it has been approved by the FDA for this purpose (see Chapter 23).

\section*{DRUGS OF ABUSE: I NTRODUCTION}

Drugs are abused (used in ways that are not medically approved) because they cause strong feelings of euphoria or alter perception. However, repetitive exposure induces widespread adaptive changes in the brain. As a consequence drug use may become compulsive-the hallmark of addiction.

\section*{BASI C NEUROBIOLOGY OF DRUG ABUSE DEPENDENCE VERSUS ADDICTION}

Recent neurobiologic research has led to the conceptual and mechanistic separation of "dependence" and "addiction." The older term "physical dependence" is now denoted dependence, while "psychological dependence" is more simply called addiction.

Every addictive drug causes its own characteristic spectrum of acute effects, but all have in common that they induce strong feelings of euphoria and reward. With repetitive exposure, addictive drugs induce adaptive changes such as tolerance (ie, escalation of dose to maintain effect). Once the abused drug is no longer available, signs of withdrawal become apparent. A combination of such signs, referred to as the withdrawal syndrome, defines dependence. Dependence is not always a correlate of drug abuse-it can also occur with many classes of nonpsychoactive drugs, eg, sympathomimetic vasoconstrictors and bronchodilators, and organic nitrate vasodilators. Addiction, on the other hand, consists of compulsive, relapsing drug use despite negative consequences, at times triggered by cravings that occur in response to contextual cues (see Animal Models in Addiction Research). While dependence will invariably occur with chronic exposure, only a fraction of subjects will develop a habit, lose control, and become addicted. For example, very few patients who receive opioids as analgesics will desire the drug after withdrawal. And only one person out of six will become addicted within 10 years of first use of cocaine. Conversely, relapse is very common in addicts after a successful withdrawal when, by definition, they are no longer dependent.

\section*{Animal Models in Addiction Research}

Many of the recent advances in addiction research have been made possible by the use of animal models. Since drugs of abuse are not only rewarding but also reinforcing, an animal will learn a behavior (eg, press a lever) when paired with drug administration. In such a self-administration paradigm, the number of times an animal is willing to press the lever in order to obtain a single dose reflects the strength of reinforcement and is therefore a measure of the rewarding properties of a drug. Observing withdrawal signs specific for rodents (eg, escape jumps or "wet-dog" shakes after abrupt termination of chronic morphine administration) allows the quantification of dependence. Behavioral tests for addiction in the rodent have proven difficult to develop and so far no test fully captures the complexity of the disease. However it is possible to model core components of addiction by monitoring behavioral sensitization and conditioned place preference. In the first test, an increase in locomotor activity is observed with intermittent drug exposure. The latter tests for the preference of a particular environment associated with drug exposure by measuring the time an animal spends in the compartment where a drug was received compared with the compartment where only saline was injected (conditioned place preference). Both tests have in common that they are sensitive to cue-conditioned effects of addictive drugs. Recent findings suggest that prolonged self-administration of cocaine leads to behaviors in rats that closely resemble human addiction. Such "addicted rats" are very strongly motivated to seek cocaine, continue looking for the drug even when no
longer available, and self-administer cocaine in spite of negative consequences, such as an electric foot shock. These findings suggest that addiction is a disease that does not respect species boundaries.

\section*{ADDI CTI VE DRUGS I NCREASE THE LEVEL OF DOPAMI NE: REI NFORCEMENT}

In order to understand the long-term changes induced by drugs of abuse, their initial molecular and cellular targets must be identified. A combination of approaches in animals and humans, including functional imaging, has revealed the mesolimbic dopamine system as the prime target of addictive drugs. This system originates in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a tiny structure at the tip of the brainstem, which projects to the nucleus accumbens, the amygdala, and the prefrontal cortex (Figure 32-1). Most projection neurons of the VTA are dopamine-producing neurons. When the dopamine neurons of the VTA begin to fire in bursts, large quantities of dopamine are released in the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex. Early animal studies pairing electrical stimulation of the VTA with operant responses (eg, lever pressing) that result in strong reinforcement established the central role of the mesolimbic dopamine system in reward processing. Direct application of drugs into the VTA also acts as a strong reinforcer, and systemic administration of drugs of abuse causes release of dopamine. As a general rule, all addictive drugs activate the mesolimbic dopamine system. The behavioral significance of this increase of dopamine is still debated. An appealing hypothesis is that mesolimbic dopamine codes for the difference between expected and actual reward and thus constitutes a strong learning signal (see The Dopamine Hypothesis of Addiction).

Major connections of the mesolimbic dopamine system in the rat brain. The dopamine projection originates in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Main targets are the nucleus accumbens (NAc), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and amygdala. Excitatory inputs reach the VTA from the PFC and the amygdala. Inhibitory inputs onto dopamine neurons come from GABA neurons within the VTA (interneurons) or as a feedback loop from the NAc. The locus caeruleus releases norepinephrine onto the VTA. Transmitters used by the neurons are indicated by gray for glutamate, black for norepinephrine, dark color for dopamine, and light color for GABA.

Since each addictive drug has a specific molecular target that engages distinct cellular mechanisms to activate the mesolimbic system, three classes can be distinguished: A first group binds to $\mathrm{G}_{\text {io }}$-coupled receptors, a second group interacts with ionotropic receptors or ion channels, and a third group targets monoamine transporters (Table 32-1). G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are of the $\mathrm{G}_{\text {io }}$ family inhibit neurons through postsynaptic hyperpolarization and presynaptic regulation of transmitter release. In the VTA, the action of these drugs is preferentially on the $\gamma^{\prime}$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons that act as local inhibitory interneurons. Addictive drugs that bind to ionotropic receptors and ion channels can have combined effects on dopamine neurons and GABA neurons, eventually leading to enhanced release of dopamine. Finally, addictive drugs that interfere with monoamine transporters block reuptake of or stimulate nonvesicular release of dopamine, causing an accumulation of extracellular dopamine in target structures. While drugs of this class also affect transporters of other monoamines (norepinephrine, serotonin), it is the action on the dopamine system that remains central for addiction. This is consistent with the observations that antidepressants that block serotonin and norepinephrine uptake, but not dopamine uptake, do not cause addiction even after prolonged use.

\section*{The Dopamine Hypothesis of Addiction}

In the earliest version of the hypothesis described in this chapter, mesolimbic dopamine was believed to be the neurochemical correlate of pleasure and reward. However, during the past decade, experimental evidence has led to several revisions. Phasic dopamine release may actually code for the prediction error of reward rather than the reward itself. This distinction is based on pioneering observations in monkeys that dopamine neurons in the VTA are most efficiently activated by a reward (eg, a few drops of fruit juice) that is not anticipated. When the animal learns to predict the occurrence of a reward (eg, by pairing it with a stimulus such as a sound), dopamine neurons stop responding to the reward itself (juice), but increase their firing rate when the conditioned stimulus (sound) occurs. Finally, if reward is predicted but not delivered (sound but no juice), dopamine neurons are inhibited below their baseline activity and become completely silent. In other words, the mesolimbic system continuously scans the reward situation. It increases its activity when reward is larger than expected, and shuts down in the opposite case, thus coding for the prediction error of reward.

Under physiologic conditions the mesolimbic dopamine signal could represent a learning signal responsible for reinforcing constructive behavioral adaptation (eg, learning to press a lever for food). Addictive drugs, by directly increasing dopamine, would generate a strong but inappropriate learning signal, thus hijacking the reward system and leading to pathologic reinforcement, further drug consumption, and addiction.

This appealing hypothesis has been challenged based on the observation that some reward and drugrelated learning is still possible in the absence of dopamine. Another intriguing observation is that mice genetically modified to lack the primary molecular target of cocaine, the dopamine transporter DAT, still self-administer the drug. Only when transporters of other biogenic amines are also knocked out does cocaine completely lose its rewarding properties. However, in DAT-/- mice, in which basal synaptic dopamine levels are high, cocaine still leads to increased dopamine release, presumably because other cocaine-sensitive amine transporters are able to clear some dopamine. When cocaine is given, these transporters (NET, SERT) are also inhibited and dopamine is again increased. This concept is supported by
newer evidence showing that deletion of the cocaine binding site on DAT leaves basal dopamine levels unchanged but abolishes the rewarding effect of cocaine.

The dopamine hypothesis of addiction has also been challenged by the observation that salient stimuli that are not rewarding (they may actually even be aversive and therefore negative reinforcers) also activate the VTA. However, the neurons in the VTA that are activated by aversive stimuli do not release dopamine, and dopamine neurons are actually inhibited by aversive stimuli. These findings suggest that the controversy can be resolved in favor of dopamine reward theories.

Whatever the precise role of dopamine under physiologic conditions, all addictive drugs strongly increase its concentration in target structures of the mesolimbic projection. This suggests that high levels of dopamine may actually be at the origin of the adaptive changes that underlie dependence and addiction.

\section*{DEPENDENCE: TOLERANCE \& WITHDRAWAL}

With chronic exposure to addictive drugs, the brain shows signs of adaptation. For example, if morphine is used at short intervals, the dose has to be progressively increased over the course of several days to maintain rewarding or analgesic effects. This phenomenon is called tolerance. It may become a serious problem because of increasing side-effects-eg, respiratory depression-that do not show much tolerance and may lead to fatalities associated with overdose.

Tolerance to opioids may be due to a reduction of the concentration of a drug or a shorter duration of action in a target system (pharmacokinetic tolerance). Alternatively, it may involve changes of $\mu$ opioid receptor function (pharmacodynamic tolerance). In fact, many $\mu$ opioid receptor agonists promote strong receptor phosphorylation that triggers the recruitment of the adaptor protein $B$-arrestin, causing $G$ proteins to uncouple from the receptor and to internalize within minutes. Since this decreases signaling, it is tempting to explain tolerance by such a mechanism. However, morphine, which strongly induces tolerance, does not recruit $B$-arrestins and fails to promote receptor internalization. Conversely, other agonists that drive receptor internalization very efficiently induce only modest tolerance. Based on these observations it has been hypothesized that desensitization and receptor internalization actually protect the cell from overstimulation. In this model, morphine, by failing to trigger receptor endocytosis, disproportionally stimulates adaptive processes, which eventually cause tolerance. Although the molecular identity of these processes is still under investigation, they may be similar to the ones involved in withdrawal (see below).

Adaptive changes become fully apparent once drug exposure is terminated. This state is called withdrawal and is observed to varying degrees following chronic exposure to most drugs of abuse. Withdrawal from opioids in humans is particularly strong and is described below. Studies in rodents have added significantly to our understanding of the neural and molecular mechanisms that underlie dependence. For example, dependence, as well as analgesia and reward, are abolished in knockout mice lacking the $\mu$ opioid receptor, but not in mice lacking other opioid receptors ( $\delta, k$ ). While activation of the $\mu$ opioid receptor initially strongly inhibits adenylyl cyclase, this inhibition becomes weaker after several days of repeated exposure. The waning of the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase is due to a counter adaptation of the enzyme system during exposure to the drug, which results in overproduction of cAMP during subsequent withdrawal. Several mechanisms exist for this adenylyl cyclase compensatory response, including up-regulation of transcription of the enzyme. Increased cAMP concentrations in turn strongly activate the transcription factor CREB, leading to the regulation of downstream genes. Of the few such genes identified to date, one of the most interesting is the gene for the endogenous kopioid ligand dynorphin. During withdrawal, neurons of the
nucleus accumbens produce high levels of dynorphin, which is then co-released with GABA onto the projection neurons of the VTA (Figure 32-2). These cells express kopioid receptors on their synaptic terminals and on the dendrites. As a consequence, they are inhibited and dopamine release is reduced. This mechanism exemplifies the adaptive processes engaged during dependence, and may underlie the intense dysphoria typically observed during withdrawal.

CREB-mediated up-regulation of dynorphin during withdrawal from dependence. Supersensitization of adenylyl cyclase (AC) leads to an increase of cAMP concentration in medium spiny neurons of the accumbens. This activates the transcription factor CREB, which turns on several genes, including that for dynorphin. Dynorphin is then co-released with $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA), activating the $\kappa$-opioid receptor (KOR) located on dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and thereby leading to pre- and postsynaptic inhibition. ( $D_{2} R$, dopamine $D_{2}$ receptor.)

\section*{ADDI CTI ON: A DI SEASE OF MALADAPTI VE LEARNI NG}

Addiction is characterized by a high motivation to obtain and use a drug despite negative consequences. With time, drug use becomes compulsive ("wanting without liking"). Addiction is a recalcitrant, chronic, and stubbornly relapsing disease that is very difficult to treat.

The central problem is that even after successful withdrawal and prolonged drug-free periods, addicted
individuals are at high risk of relapsing. Relapse is typically triggered by one of the following three conditions: reexposure to the drug of abuse, stress, or a context that recalls prior drug use. It appears that when paired with drug use, a neutral stimulus may undergo a switch and motivate ("trigger") addictionrelated behavior. This phenomenon may involve synaptic plasticity in the target nuclei of the mesolimbic projection (eg, nucleus accumbens). For example, cravings may recur at the presentation of contextual cues (eg, people, places, or drug paraphernalia), suggesting the involvement of learning and memory systems. If dopamine release codes for the prediction error of reward (see The Dopamine Hypothesis of Addiction), the stimulation of the mesolimbic dopamine systems will generate an unusually strong learning signal. Unlike natural rewards, addictive drugs continue to increase dopamine even when reward is expected. Such overriding of the prediction error signal may eventually be responsible for the "usurping of memory processes" by addictive drugs. The involvement of learning and memory systems in addiction is also suggested by clinical studies. For example, the role of context in relapse is supported by the report that soldiers who became addicted to heroin during the Vietnam War had significantly better outcomes when treated after their return home, compared with addicts who remained in the environment where they had taken the drug. Current research therefore focuses on the effects of drugs on associative forms of synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP), that underlie learning and memory (see Synaptic Plasticity \& Addiction).

Large individual differences exist in vulnerability to addiction. Whereas one person may become "hooked" after a few doses, others may be able to use a drug occasionally during their entire lives without ever having difficulty in stopping. Even when dependence is induced with chronic exposure, only a fraction of dependent users will go on to become addicted. The transition to addiction is determined by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Heritability of addiction, as determined by comparing monozygotic with dizygotic twins, is relatively modest for cannabinoids but very high for cocaine. It is of interest that the relative risk for addiction (addiction liability) of a drug (Table 32-1) correlates with its heritability, suggesting that the neurobiologic basis of addiction common to all drugs is what is being inherited. Further genomic analysis indicates that only a few alleles (or perhaps even a single recessive allele) need to function in combination to produce the phenotype. However, identification of the genes involved remains elusive. While some substance-specific candidate genes have been identified (eg, alcohol dehydrogenase), future research will also focus on genes implicated in the neurobiologic mechanisms common to all addictive drugs.

\section*{Synaptic Plasticity \& Addiction}

Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a form of experience-dependent synaptic plasticity that is induced by activating glutamate receptors of the N -methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA) type. Since NMDA receptors are blocked by magnesium at negative potentials, their activation requires the concomitant release of glutamate (presynaptic activity) onto a receiving neuron that is depolarized (postsynaptic activity). Correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity durably enhances synaptic efficacy and triggers the formation of new connections. Because associativity is a critical component, LTP has become a leading candidate mechanism underlying learning and memory. LTP can be elicited at glutamatergic synapses of the mesolimbic reward system and is modulated by dopamine. Drugs of abuse could therefore interfere with LTP at sites of convergence of dopamine and glutamate projections (eg, nucleus accumbens or prefrontal cortex). Interestingly, exposure to an addictive drug triggers LTP at excitatory afferents and reduces GABA receptor-mediated inhibition of the VTA, thus increasing the excitability of dopamine neurons. Genetic manipulations in mice that abolish LTP at this synapse also have effects on behavioral paradigms that
model core components of addiction such as conditioned place preference, further supporting the idea that LTP is involved in context-dependent components of relapse. Similarly, interfering with transcriptional signaling implicated in the late phases of LTP affects conditioned place preference.

\section*{NONADDI CTI VE DRUGS OF ABUSE}

Some drugs of abuse do not lead to addiction. This is the case for substances that alter perception without causing sensations of reward and euphoria, such as the hallucinogens and the dissociative anesthetics (Table 32-1). These agents primarily target cortical and thalamic circuits unlike addictive drugs, which primarily target the mesolimbic dopamine system (see above). Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), for example, activates the serotonin $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A}}$ receptor in the prefrontal cortex, enhancing glutamatergic transmission onto pyramidal neurons. These excitatory afferents mainly come from the thalamus and carry sensory information of different modalities, which may constitute a link to enhanced perception.
Phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine produce a feeling of separation of mind and body (which is why they are called dissociative anesthetics) and, at higher doses, stupor and coma. The principal mechanism of action is a use-dependent inhibition of glutamate receptors of the NMDA type.

The classification of NMDA antagonists as nonaddictive drugs was based on early assessments, which, in the case of PCP, have recently been questioned. In fact, animal research shows that PCP can increase mesolimbic dopamine concentrations and has some reinforcing properties in rodents. Concurrent effects on both thalamocortical and mesolimbic systems also exist for other addictive drugs. Psychosis-like symptoms can be observed with cannabinoids, amphetamines, and cocaine, which may reflect their effects on thalamocortical structures. For example, cannabinoids, in addition to their documented effects on the mesolimbic dopamine system, also enhance excitation in cortical circuits through presynaptic inhibition of GABA release.

Hallucinogens and NMDA antagonists, even if they do not produce dependence or addiction, can still have long-term effects. Flashbacks of altered perception can occur years after LSD consumption. Moreover, chronic use of PCP may lead to an irreversible schizophrenia-like psychosis.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF DRUGS OF ABUSE}

Since all addictive drugs increase dopamine concentrations in target structures of the mesolimbic projections, we classify them on the basis of their molecular targets and the underlying mechanisms (Table 32-1). The first group contains the opioids, cannabinoids, $\gamma$-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), and the hallucinogens, which all exert their action through $G_{i o}$ protein-coupled receptors. The second group includes nicotine, alcohol, the benzodiazepines, dissociative anesthetics, and some inhalants, which interact with ionotropic receptors or ion channels. The last group comprises cocaine, amphetamines, and ecstasy, which all bind to monoamine transporters. The nonaddictive drugs are classified using the same criteria.

\section*{Drugs that Activate Gio - Coupled Receptors OPIOIDS}

\section*{Pharmacology \& Clinical Aspects}

As described in Chapter 31, the opioids comprise a large family of endogenous and exogenous agonists at three G protein-coupled receptors: the $\mu, \kappa$, and $\delta$ opioid receptors. Although all three receptors couple to
inhibitory G proteins (ie, they all inhibit adenylyl cyclase), they have distinct, sometimes even opposing effects, mainly because of the cell type-specific expression throughout the brain. In the VTA, for example, $\mu$. opioid receptors are selectively expressed on GABA neurons (which they inhibit), while kopioid receptors are expressed on and inhibit dopamine neurons. This may explain why $\mu$ opioid agonists cause euphoria while $\kappa$ agonists induce dysphoria (see also Figure 32-3). In line with these observations, the rewarding effects of morphine are absent in knockout mice lacking $\mu$ receptors but persist when either of the other opioid receptors are ablated. In the VTA, $\mu$ opioids cause an inhibition of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons that leads eventually to a disinhibition of dopamine neurons (Figure 32-3).
Figure 32-3.

Disinhibition of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) through drugs that act via $\mathrm{G}_{\text {io }}$-coupled receptors. Top: Opioids target $\mu$ opioid receptors (MORs) that in the VTA are located exclusively on $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons. MORs are expressed on the presynaptic terminal of these cells and the somatodendritic compartment of the postsynaptic cells. Each compartment has distinct effectors (insets ). G protein-Br-mediated inhibition of voltagegated calcium channels (VGCC) is the major mechanism in the presynaptic terminal. Conversely, in dendrites MORs activate K channels. Middle: $\Delta^{9}$-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other cannabinoids mainly act through presynaptic inhibition. Bottom: Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) targets GABAB receptors, which are located on both cell types. However, GABA neurons are more sensitive to GHB than are DA neurons, leading to disinhibition at concentrations typically obtained with recreational use. (CB1R, cannabinoid receptors.)

The most commonly abused $\mu$ opioids include morphine, heroin (diacetylmorphine, which is rapidly
metabolized to morphine), codeine, and oxycodone. Meperidine abuse is common among health professionals. All of these drugs induce strong tolerance and dependence. The withdrawal syndrome may be very severe (except for codeine) and includes intense dysphoria, nausea or vomiting, muscle aches, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, mydriasis, piloerection, sweating, diarrhea, yawning, and fever. Beyond the withdrawal syndrome, which usually lasts no longer than a few days, individuals who have received opioids as analgesics will only rarely develop addiction. In contrast, when taken for recreational purposes, opioids are highly addictive. The relative risk of addiction is 4 out of 5 on a widely used scale (Table 32-1).

\section*{Treatment}

The opioid antagonist naloxone reverses the effects of a dose of morphine or heroin within minutes. This may be life-saving in the case of a massive overdose (see Chapters 31 and 59). Naloxone administration also provokes an acute withdrawal (precipitated abstinence) syndrome in a dependent person who has recently taken an opioid.

In the treatment of opioid addiction, a long-acting opioid (eg, methadone) is often substituted for the shorter-acting, more rewarding, opioid (eg, heroin). For substitution therapy, methadone is given orally once daily, facilitating supervised intake. The much longer half-life of methadone may also have some beneficial effects (eg, weaker drug sensitization, which typically requires intermittent exposures), but it is important to realize that abrupt termination of methadone administration invariably precipitates a withdrawal syndrome; that is, the subject on substitution therapy remains dependent. Some countries (eg, Switzerland, Netherlands) even allow substitution of heroin by heroin. A follow-up of a cohort of addicts who receive heroin injections in a controlled setting and have access to counseling indicates that addicts under heroin-substitution have an improved health status and are better integrated in society.

\section*{CANNABI NOI DS}

Endogenous cannabinoids that act as neurotransmitters include 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG) and anandamide, both of which bind to CB1 receptors. These very lipid-soluble compounds are released at the postsynaptic somatodendritic membrane, and diffuse through the extracellular space to bind at presynaptic CB1 receptors where they inhibit the release of either glutamate or GABA (Figure 32-3). Because of such backward signaling, endocannabinoids are called retrograde messengers. In the hippocampus, release of endocannabinoids from pyramidal neurons selectively affects inhibitory transmission and may contribute to the induction of synaptic plasticity during learning and memory formation.

Exogenous cannabinoids, eg in marijuana, comprise several pharmacologically active substances including $\Delta^{9}$-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a powerful psychoactive substance. Like opioids, THC causes disinhibition of dopamine neurons, mainly by presynaptic inhibition of GABA neurons in the VTA. The half-life of THC is about 4 hours. The onset of effects of THC after smoking marijuana occurs within minutes and reaches a maximum after 1-2 hours. The most prominent effects are euphoria and relaxation. Users also report feelings of well-being, grandiosity, and altered perception of passage of time. Dose-dependent perceptual changes (eg, visual distortions), drowsiness, diminished coordination, and memory impairment may occur. Cannabinoids can also create a dysphoric state and in rare cases, following the use of very high doses, may result in visual hallucinations, depersonalization, and frank psychotic episodes. Additional effects of THC, eg, increased appetite, attenuation of nausea, decreased intraocular pressure, and relief of chronic pain, have led to the use of cannabinoids in medical therapeutics. The justification of medicinal use of marijuana was comprehensively examined by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences in
its 1999 report, Marijuana \& Medicine. This continues to be a controversial issue, mainly because of the fear that cannabinoids may serve as a gateway to the consumption of "hard" drugs. Chronic exposure to marijuana leads to dependence, which is revealed by a distinctive, but mild and short-lived, withdrawal syndrome that includes restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, nausea, and cramping. The relative risk for addiction is 2 (Table 32-1).

The synthetic $\Delta^{9}$-THC analog dronabinol is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved cannabinoid agonist currently marketed in the USA and some European countries. Nabilone, an older commercial $\Delta^{9}$ THC analog, may be reintroduced in the USA in the near future. The cannabinoid system is likely to emerge as an important drug target in the future because of its apparent involvement in several therapeutically desirable effects.

\section*{GAMMA-HYDROXYBUTYRIC ACID (GHB)}

Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid is produced endogenously during the metabolism of GABA, but the function of this endogenous agent is unknown at present. The pharmacology of GHB is complex because there are two distinct binding sites. The protein that contains a high-affinity binding site ( $1 \mu \mathrm{M}$ ) for GHB has recently been cloned, but its involvement in the cellular effects of GHB at pharmacologic concentrations remains unclear. The low-affinity binding site ( 1 mM ) has been identified as the $G A B A_{B}$ receptor (Figure 32-3). In mice that lack $G A B A_{B}$ receptors even very high doses of $G H B$ have no effect, suggesting that $G A B A_{B}$ receptors are the sole mediators of GHB's pharmacologic action.

Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid was first synthesized in 1960 and introduced as a general anesthetic. Because of its narrow safety margin and its addictive potential it is not available in the USA for this purpose at present. Before causing sedation and coma, GHB causes euphoria, enhanced sensory perceptions, a feeling of social closeness, and amnesia. These properties have made it a popular "club drug" that goes by colorful street names such as "liquid ecstasy," "grievous bodily harm," or "date rape drug." As the latter name suggests, GHB has been used in date rapes, because it is odorless and can be readily dissolved in beverages. It is rapidly absorbed after ingestion and reaches a maximal plasma concentration 20-30 minutes following ingestion of a $10-20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ dose. The elimination half-life is about 30 minutes.

Although GABA ${ }_{B}$ receptors are expressed on all neurons of the VTA, GABA neurons are much more sensitive to GHB than dopamine neurons (the EC $\mathrm{E}_{50}$ differs by about one order of magnitude). Because GHB is a weak agonist, only GABA neurons are inhibited at the concentrations typically obtained with recreational use. This feature may underlie the reinforcing effects of GHB and the basis for addiction to the drug. At higher doses, however, GHB also hyperpolarizes dopamine neurons, eventually completely inhibiting dopamine release. Such an inhibition of the VTA may in turn preclude its activation by other addictive drugs and may explain why GHB might have some utility as an "anticraving" compound.

\section*{LSD, MESCALI NE, \& PSI LOCYBI N}

These three drugs are commonly called hallucinogens because of their ability to alter consciousness such that the individual senses things that are not present. They induce, often in an unpredictable way, perceptual symptoms, including shape and color distortion. Psychosis-like manifestations (depersonalization, hallucinations, distorted time perception) have led some to classify these drugs as psychotomimetics. They also produce somatic symptoms (dizziness, nausea, paresthesias, and blurred vision). Some users have reported intense reexperiencing of perceptual effects (flashbacks) up to several years after the last drug exposure.

Hallucinogens differ from most other drugs described in this chapter in that they induce neither dependence nor addiction. However repetitive exposure still leads to rapid tolerance (also called tachyphylaxis). Animals will not self-administer hallucinogens, suggesting that they are not rewarding. Additional studies show that these drugs also fail to stimulate dopamine release, further supporting the idea that only drugs that activate the mesolimbic dopamine system are addictive. Instead, hallucinogens increase glutamate release in the cortex, presumably by enhancing excitatory afferent input from the thalamus.

The molecular target of hallucinogens is the $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A}}$ receptor. This receptor couples to G proteins of the $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{q}}$ type and generates inositol trisphosphate ( $I P_{3}$ ), leading to a release of intracellular calcium. Although hallucinogens, and LSD in particular, have been proposed for several therapeutic indications, efficacy has never been demonstrated.

\section*{Drugs that Mediate Their Effects Via I onotropic Receptors NI COTI NE}

\section*{Pharmacology}

In terms of numbers affected, addiction to nicotine exceeds all other forms of addiction, touching more than $50 \%$ of all adults in some countries. Nicotine exposure occurs primarily through smoking of tobacco, which causes associated diseases that are responsible for many preventable deaths. The chronic use of chewing tobacco and snuff tobacco is also addicting.

Nicotine is a selective agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) that is normally activated by acetylcholine (see Chapter 6). Based on nicotine's enhancement of cognitive performance and the association of Alzheimer's dementia with a loss of ACh-releasing neurons from the nucleus basalis of Meynert, nAChRs are believed to play an important role in many cognitive processes. The rewarding effect of nicotine requires involvement of the VTA, where nAChRs are expressed on dopamine neurons. When nicotine excites projection neurons, dopamine is released in the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex, thus fulfilling the dopamine requirement of addictive drugs. Recent work has identified $a_{4} B_{2}-$ containing channels in the VTA as the nAChRs that are required for the rewarding effects of nicotine. This statement is based on the observation that knockout mice deficient for the $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ subunit lose interest in selfadministering nicotine, and that in these mice, this behavior can be restored through an in-vivo transfection of the $B_{2}$ subunit in neurons of the VTA. Electrophysiologic evidence suggests that homomeric nAChRs made exclusively of $Q_{7}$ subunits also contribute to the reinforcing effects of nicotine. These receptors are mainly expressed on synaptic terminals of excitatory afferents projecting onto the dopamine neurons. They also contribute to nicotine-evoked dopamine release and the long-term changes induced by the drugs related to addiction (eg, long-term synaptic potentiation of excitatory inputs).

Nicotine withdrawal is mild compared with opioid withdrawal, and involves irritability and sleeplessness. However, nicotine is among the most addictive drugs (relative risk $=4$, Table 32-1), and relapse after attempted cessation is very common.

\section*{Treatment}

Treatment for nicotine addiction includes substituting nicotine that is chewed, inhaled, or transdermally delivered for the nicotine in cigarettes, thus slowing the pharmacokinetics and eliminating the many complications associated with the toxic substances found in tobacco smoke. At present, all available agents seem to be similarly effective in relieving craving, controlling the habit, and facilitating quitting. In addition,
the antidepressant bupropion has been approved for nicotine cessation therapy. It is most effective when combined with behavioral therapies. Many countries have banned smoking in public places to create smokefree environments. This important step not only reduces passive smoking and the hazards of secondhand smoke, but also the risk that ex-smokers will be exposed to smoke, which as a contextual cue, may trigger relapse.

\section*{BENZODI AZEPI NES}

Benzodiazepines are commonly prescribed as anxiolytics and sleep medications. They represent a moderate risk for abuse, which has to be weighed against their beneficial effects. Benzodiazepines are abused by some persons for their euphoriant effects, but most often abuse occurs concomitant with other drugs, eg, to attenuate anxiety during withdrawal from opioids.

Barbiturates, which preceded benzodiazepines as the most commonly abused sedative hypnotics (after ethanol), are now rarely prescribed to outpatients and therefore constitute a less common prescription drug problem than they did in the past. Street sales of barbiturates, however, continue. Management of barbiturate withdrawal and addiction is similar to that of benzodiazepines.

While benzodiazepine dependence is very common, cases that fulfill all the diagnostic criteria for addiction are rare. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines occurs within days of stopping the medication, and varies as a function of the half-life of elimination. Symptoms include irritability, insomnia, phono- and photophobia, depression, muscle cramps, and even seizures. Typically these symptoms taper off within 1-2 weeks.

Benzodiazepines are positive modulators of the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor, increasing both single channel conductance and open-channel probability. GABA receptors are pentameric structures consisting of a., $B$, and $\gamma_{\text {subunits }}$ (see Chapter 22). GABA receptors on dopamine neurons of the VTA lack $\alpha_{1}$, a subunit that is typically present in GABA neurons. In addition, GABA ${ }_{A}$ receptors are expressed in much higher density on interneurons, so that a disinhibition of the mesolimbic dopamine system may explain the rewarding effects of benzodiazepines. Receptors containing $a_{5}$ seem to be required for tolerance to the sedative effects of benzodiazepines, and studies in humans link $\alpha_{2} \gamma_{3}$-containing receptors to alcohol dependence (the GABAA receptor is also a target of alcohol, see below). Taken together, a picture is emerging linking GABA receptors of specific subunit composition to their therapeutic effects and to dependence and addiction induced with chronic exposure.

\section*{ALCOHOL}

Alcohol (ethanol, see Chapter 23) is regularly used by a majority of the population in many Western countries. Although only a minority becomes dependent and addicted, abuse is a very serious public health problem, because of the many diseases associated with alcoholism.

\section*{Pharmacology}

The pharmacology of alcohol is complex and no single receptor mediates all of its effects. On the contrary, alcohol alters the function of several receptors and cellular functions, including GABA receptors, Kir3/GIRK channels, adenosine reuptake (through the equilibrative nucleoside transporter, ENT1), glycine receptor, NMDA receptor, and $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptor. They are all, with the exception of ENT1, either ionotropic receptors or ion channels. It is not clear which of these targets is responsible for the increase of dopamine release from the mesolimbic reward system. The inhibition of ENT1 is probably not responsible for the rewarding effects (ENT1 knockout mice drink more than controls) but seems to be involved in alcohol dependence through an
accumulation of adenosine, stimulation of adenosine $A_{2}$ receptors, and ensuing enhanced CREB signaling.
Dependence becomes apparent 6-12 hours after cessation of heavy drinking as a withdrawal syndrome that may include tremor (mainly of the hands), nausea and vomiting, excessive sweating, agitation, and anxiety. In some individuals this is followed by visual, tactile, and auditory hallucinations 12-24 hours after cessation. Generalized seizures may manifest after 24-48 hours. Finally, 48-72 hours after cessation, an alcohol withdrawal delirium (delirium tremens) may become apparent in which the person hallucinates, is disoriented, and shows evidence of autonomic instability. Delirium tremens is associated with $5-15 \%$ mortality.

\section*{Treatment}

Treatment of ethanol withdrawal is supportive and relies on benzodiazepines, taking care to use compounds such as oxazepam and lorazepam, which are not as dependent on hepatic metabolism as most other benzodiazepines. In cases where monitoring is not reliable and liver function is adequate, a longer acting benzodiazepine such as chlordiazepoxide is preferred.

As in the treatment of all chronic drug abuse problems, heavy reliance is placed on psychosocial approaches to alcohol addiction. This is perhaps even more important for the alcoholic patient because of the ubiquitous presence of alcohol in many social contexts.

The pharmacologic treatment of alcohol addiction is limited although several compounds, with different goals, have been used. Disulfiram has been used as an adjunct to create aversion to drinking. Disulfiram inhibits acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, causing nausea, vomiting, and dysphoria with coincident alcohol use. Recently the efficacy of disulfiram has been questioned, and no large trials are available that conclusively demonstrate increased abstinence.

Naltrexone is an antagonist and partial agonist of the $\mu$-opioid receptor, which may decrease the craving for alcohol, resulting in fewer relapses. Although most, but not all, studies found that naltrexone decreases relapses, the effect is modest. Combining naltrexone therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy may enhance benefit.

The antiepileptic compound topiramate facilitates GABA function and antagonizes glutamate receptors (presumably the AMPA type), and may decrease mesocorticolimbic dopamine release after alcohol and reduce cravings. However, topiramate does not have FDA approval for this indication.

In Europe several trials have been carried out with acamprosate, an NMDA receptor antagonist. However, most patients returned to drinking while still using the drug. A direct comparison with naltrexone showed acamprosate to be less effective.

\section*{KETAMI NE \& PHENCYCLI DI NE (PCP)}

Ketamine and PCP were developed as general anesthetics (see Chapter 25), but only ketamine is still used for this application. Both drugs, along with others, are now classified as "club drugs" and sold under names such as "angel dust," "Hog," and "Special K." They owe their effects to their use-dependent, noncompetitive antagonism of the NMDA receptor. The effects of these substances became apparent when patients undergoing surgery reported unpleasant vivid dreams and hallucinations after anesthesia. Ketamine and PCP are white crystalline powders in their pure forms, but on the street they are also sold as a liquids, capsules, or pills, which can be snorted, ingested, injected, or smoked. Psychedelic effects last for about 1 hour and also include increased blood pressure, impaired memory function, and visual alterations. At high
doses unpleasant out-of-body and near-death experiences have been reported. Although ketamine and phencyclidine do not cause dependence and addiction (relative risk $=1$, Table 32-1), chronic exposure, particularly to PCP, may lead to long-lasting psychosis closely resembling schizophrenia, which may persist beyond drug exposure.

\section*{I NHALANTS}

Inhalant abuse is defined as recreational exposure to chemical vapors, such as nitrates, ketones, and aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. These substances are present in a variety of household and industrial products that are inhaled by "sniffing," "huffing," or "bagging." Sniffing refers to inhalation from an open container, huffing to the soaking of a cloth in the volatile substance before inhalation, and bagging to breathing in and out of a paper or plastic bag filled with fumes. It is common for novices to start with sniffing and progress to huffing and bagging as addiction develops. Inhalant abuse is particularly prevalent in children and young adults.

The exact mechanism of action of most volatile substances remains unknown. Altered function of ionotropic receptors and ion channels throughout the central nervous system has been demonstrated for a few. Nitrous oxide, for example, binds to NMDA receptors and fuel additives enhance GABA ${ }_{A}$ receptor function. Most inhalants produce euphoria; increased excitability of the VTA has been documented for toluene and may underlie its addiction risk. Other substances, such as amyl nitrite ("poppers"), primarily produce smooth muscle relaxation and enhance erection, but are not addictive. With chronic exposure to the aromatic hydrocarbons (eg, benzene, toluene) toxic effects can be observed in many organs, including white matter lesions in the central nervous system. Management of overdose remains supportive.

\section*{Drugs that Bind to Transporters of Biogenic Amines COCAI NE}

The prevalence of cocaine abuse has increased greatly over the past decade and now represents a major public health problem worldwide. Cocaine is highly addictive (relative risk $=5$, Table 32-1), and its use is associated with a number of complications.

Cocaine is an alkaloid found in the leaves of Erythroxylon coca, a shrub indigenous to the Andes. For more than 100 years, it has been extracted and used in clinical medicine, mainly as a local anesthetic and to dilate pupils in ophthalmology. Sigmund Freud famously proposed its use to treat depression and alcohol dependence, but addiction quickly brought an end to this idea.

Cocaine hydrochloride is a water-soluble salt that can be injected or absorbed by any mucosal membrane (eg, nasal snorting). When heated in an alkaline solution it is transformed into the free base, "crack cocaine," which can then be smoked. Inhaled crack cocaine is rapidly absorbed in the lungs and penetrates swiftly into the brain, producing an almost instantaneous "rush."

In the peripheral nervous system, cocaine inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels, thus blocking initiation and conduction of action potentials (see Chapter 26). This effect, however, seems responsible for neither the acute rewarding nor the addictive effects. In the central nervous system, cocaine blocks the uptake of dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin through their respective transporters. The block of the dopamine transporter (DAT), by increasing dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens, has been implicated in the rewarding effects of cocaine (Figure 32-4). In fact, rewarding effects of cocaine are abolished in mice with a cocaine-insensitive DAT. The activation of the sympathetic nervous system results mainly from the
block of the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and leads to an acute increase in arterial pressure, tachycardia, and often, ventricular arrhythmias. Subjects typically lose appetite, are hyperactive, and sleep little. Cocaine exposure increases the risk for intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and generalized or partial seizures. Cocaine overdose may lead to hyperthermia, coma, and death.

\section*{AMPHETAMI NES}

Amphetamines are a group of synthetic, indirect-acting sympathomimetic drugs that cause the release of endogenous biogenic amines, such as dopamine and noradrenaline (see Chapters 6 and 9). Amphetamine, methamphetamine, and their many derivatives exert their effects by reversing the action of biogenic amine transporters at the plasma membrane. Amphetamines are substrates of these transporters and are taken up into the cell (Figure 32-4). Once in the cell, amphetamines interfere with the vesicular monoamine
transporter (VMAT), depleting synaptic vesicles of their neurotransmitter content. As a consequence, levels of dopamine (or other transmitter amine) in the cytoplasm increase and quickly become sufficient to cause release into the synapse by reversal of the plasma membrane DAT. Normal vesicular release of dopamine consequently decreases (because synaptic vesicles contain less transmitter), while nonvesicular release increases. Similar mechanisms apply for other biogenic amines (serotonin and norepinephrine).

Together with GHB and ecstasy, amphetamines are often referred to as "club drugs," because they are increasingly popular in the club scene. They are often produced in small clandestine laboratories, which makes their precise chemical identification difficult. They differ from ecstasy chiefly in the context of use: intravenous administration and "hard core" addiction is far more common with amphetamines, especially methamphetamine. In general, amphetamines lead to elevated catecholamine levels that increase arousal and reduce sleep, while the effects on the dopamine system mediate euphoria but may also cause abnormal movements and precipitate psychotic episodes. Effects on serotonin transmission may play a role in the hallucinogenic and anorexigenic functions as well as in the hyperthermia often caused by amphetamines.

Unlike many other abused drugs, amphetamines are neurotoxic. The exact mechanism is not known, but neurotoxicity depends on the NMDA receptor and affects mainly serotonin and dopamine neurons.

Amphetamines are typically taken initially in pill form by abusers, but can also be smoked or injected. Heavy users often progress rapidly to intravenous administration. Within hours after oral ingestion, amphetamines increase alertness, cause euphoria, agitation, and confusion. Bruxism (tooth grinding) and skin flushing may occur. Effects on heart rate may be minimal with some compounds (eg, methamphetamine), but with increasing dosage these agents often lead to tachycardia and dysrhythmias. Hypertensive crisis and vasoconstriction may lead to stroke. Spread of HIV and hepatitis infection in inner cities has been closely associated with needle sharing by intravenous users of methamphetamine.

With chronic use, tolerance may develop, leading to dose escalation. Withdrawal consists of dysphoria, drowsiness (in some cases, insomnia), and general irritability.

\section*{ECSTASY (MDMA)}

Ecstasy is the name of a class of drugs that includes a large variety of derivatives of the amphetaminerelated compound methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). MDMA was originally used in some forms of psychotherapy but no medically useful effects were documented. This is perhaps not surprising, because the main effect of ecstasy appears to be to foster feelings of intimacy and empathy without impairing intellectual capacities. Today, MDMA and its many derivatives are often produced in small quantities in ad hoc laboratories and distributed at parties or "raves" where it is taken orally. Ecstasy therefore is the prototypical designer drug and as such, increasingly popular.

Similar to the amphetamines, MDMA causes release of biogenic amines by reversing the action of their respective transporters. It has a preferential affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) and therefore most strongly increases the extracellular concentration of serotonin. This release is so profound that there is a marked intracellular depletion for 24 hours after a single dose. With repetitive administration, serotonin depletion may become permanent, which has triggered a debate on its neurotoxicity. Although direct proof from animal models for neurotoxicity remains weak, several studies report long-term cognitive impairment in heavy users of MDMA.

In contrast, there is a wide consensus that MDMA has several acute toxic effects, in particular hyperthermia, which along with dehydration (eg, caused by an all-night dance party) may be fatal. Other complications include serotonin syndrome (mental status change, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities, see Chapter 16) and seizures. Following warnings about the dangers of MDMA, some users have attempted to compensate for hyperthermia by drinking excessive amounts of water, causing water intoxication involving severe hyponatremia, seizures, and even death.

Withdrawal is marked by a mood "offset" characterized by depression lasting up to several weeks. There have also been reports of increased aggression during periods of abstinence in chronic MDMA users.

Taken together, the evidence for irreversible damage to the brain, although not completely convincing, implies that even occasional recreational use of MDMA cannot be considered safe.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF DEPENDENCE \& ADDI CTI ON}

To date no single pharmacologic treatment (even in combination with behavioral interventions) efficiently eliminates addiction. This is not to say that addiction is irreversible. Pharmacologic interventions may in fact be useful at all stages of the disease. This is particularly true in the case of a massive overdose, in which reversal of drug action may be a life-saving measure. However, in this regard, FDA-approved antagonists are only available for opioids and benzodiazepines.

Pharmacologic interventions may also aim to alleviate the withdrawal syndrome, particularly after opioid exposure. On the assumption that withdrawal reflects at least in part a hyperactivity of central adrenergic systems, the $a_{2}$-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (also used as a centrally active antihypertensive drug, see Chapter 11) has been used with some success to attenuate withdrawal. Today most clinicians prefer to manage opioid withdrawal by tapering very slowly the administration of long-acting opioids.

Another widely accepted treatment is substitution of a legally available agonist that acts at the same receptor as the abused drug. This approach has been approved for opioids and nicotine. For example, heroin addicts may receive methadone to replace heroin; smoking addicts may receive nicotine continuously via a transdermal patch system to replace smoking. In general, a rapidly acting substance is replaced with one that acts or is absorbed more slowly. Substitution treatments are largely justified by the benefits of reducing associated health risks, the reduction of drug-associated crime, and better social integration. While dependence persists, it may be possible, with the support of behavioral interventions, to motivate drug users to gradually reduce the dose and become abstinent.

The biggest challenge is the treatment of addiction itself. Several approaches have been taken, but all remain experimental. One approach is to pharmacologically reduce cravings. The $\mu$ opioid receptor antagonist and partial agonist naltrexone is FDA-approved for this indication in opioid and alcohol addiction. Its effect is modest and may involve a modulation of endogenous opioid systems.

Clinical trials are currently being conducted with a number of drugs, including the high-affinity $G A B A_{B}$ receptor agonist baclofen, and initial results have shown a significant reduction of craving. This effect may be mediated by the inhibition of the dopamine neurons of the VTA, which is possible at baclofen concentrations obtained by oral administration because of its very high affinity for the $G A B A_{B}$ receptor.

Rimonabant is a novel cannabinoid antagonist that should soon become available for the treatment of addiction. Initially developed for nicotine addiction, it may be useful in the treatment of abuse of cocaine,
heroin, and alcohol. Although its cellular mechanism is unclear, data in rodents convincingly demonstrate that this compound can reduce self-administration in naïve as well as in drug-experienced animals.

\section*{AGENTS USED I N ANEMI AS; HEMATOPOI ETI C GROWTH FACTORS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Hematopoiesis, the production from undifferentiated stem cells of circulating erythrocytes, platelets, and leukocytes, is a remarkable process that produces over 200 billion new blood cells per day in the normal person and even greater numbers of cells in people with conditions that cause loss or destruction of blood cells. The hematopoietic machinery resides primarily in the bone marrow in adults and requires a constant supply of three essential nutrients-iron, vitamin $\mathbf{B}_{12}$, and folic acid -as well as the presence of hematopoietic growth factors, proteins that regulate the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Inadequate supplies of either the essential nutrients or the growth factors result in deficiency of functional blood cells. Anemia, a deficiency in oxygen-carrying erythrocytes, is the most common and easily treated of these conditions, but thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are not rare and some forms are amenable to drug therapy. In this chapter, we first consider treatment of anemia due to deficiency of iron, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, or folic acid and then turn to the medical use of hematopoietic growth factors to combat anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia, and to support stem cell transplantation.

\section*{AGENTS USED IN ANEMI AS}

\section*{I RON}

\section*{Basic Pharmacology}

Iron deficiency is the most common cause of chronic anemia. Like other forms of chronic anemia, iron deficiency anemia leads to pallor, fatigue, dizziness, exertional dyspnea, and other generalized symptoms of tissue hypoxia. The cardiovascular adaptations to chronic anemia-tachycardia, increased cardiac output, vasodilation-can worsen the condition of patients with underlying cardiovascular disease.

Iron forms the nucleus of the iron-porphyrin heme ring, which together with globin chains forms hemoglobin. Hemoglobin reversibly binds oxygen and provides the critical mechanism for oxygen delivery from the lungs to other tissues. In the absence of adequate iron, small erythrocytes with insufficient hemoglobin are formed, giving rise to microcytic hypochromic anemia.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Free inorganic iron is extremely toxic, but iron is required for essential proteins such as hemoglobin; therefore, evolution has provided an elaborate system for regulating iron absorption, transport, and storage (Figure 33-1). The system uses specialized transport and storage proteins whose concentrations are controlled by the body's demand for hemoglobin synthesis and adequate iron stores (Table 33-1). Nearly all of the iron used to support hematopoiesis is reclaimed from catalysis of the hemoglobin in senescent or damaged erythrocytes. Normally, only a small amount of iron is lost from the body each day, so dietary requirements are small and easily fulfilled by the iron available in a wide variety of foods. However, in special populations with either increased iron requirements (eg, growing children, pregnant women) or increased losses of iron (eg, menstruating women), iron requirements can exceed normal dietary supplies and iron deficiency can develop.

Absorption, transport, and storage of iron. Intestinal epithelial cells actively absorb inorganic iron and heme iron (H). Ferrous iron that is absorbed or released from absorbed heme iron in the intestine (1) is actively transported into the blood or complexed with apoferritin (AF) and stored as ferritin. In the blood, iron is transported by transferrin (Tf) to erythroid precursors in the bone marrow for synthesis of hemoglobin (Hgb) (2) or to hepatocytes for storage as ferritin (3). The transferrin-iron complexes bind to transferrin receptors (TfR) in erythroid precursors and hepatocytes and are internalized. After release of the iron, the TfR-Tf complex is recycled to the plasma membrane and Tf is released.
Macrophages that phagocytize senescent erythrocytes (RBC) reclaim the iron from the RBC hemoglobin and either export it or store it as ferritin (4). Hepatocytes use several mechanisms to take up iron and store the iron as ferritin. See text.

\section*{ABSORPTION}

The average diet in the USA contains 10-15 mg of elemental iron daily. A normal individual absorbs 5-10\% of this iron, or about $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg}$ daily. Iron is normally absorbed in the duodenum and proximal jejunum, although the more distal small intestine can absorb iron if necessary. Iron absorption increases in response to low iron stores or increased iron requirements. Total iron absorption increases to $1-2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ in normal menstruating women and may be as high as $3-4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ in pregnant women.

Iron is available in a wide variety of foods but is especially abundant in meat. The iron in meat protein can be efficiently absorbed, because heme iron in meat hemoglobin and myoglobin can be absorbed intact without first having to be dissociated into elemental iron (Figure 33-1). Iron in other foods, especially vegetables and grains, is often tightly bound to organic compounds and is much less available for absorption. Nonheme iron in foods and iron in inorganic iron salts and complexes must be reduced to ferrous iron ( $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ) before it can be absorbed by intestinal mucosal cells.

Iron crosses the luminal membrane of the intestinal mucosal cell by two mechanisms: active transport of ferrous iron and absorption of iron complexed with heme (Figure 33-1). The divalent metal transporter, DMT1, efficiently transports ferrous iron across the luminal membrane of the intestinal enterocyte. The rate
of iron uptake is regulated by mucosal cell iron stores such that more iron is transported when stores are low. Together with iron split from absorbed heme, the newly absorbed iron can be actively transported into the blood across the basolateral membrane, probably by the transporter IREG1, also known as ferroportin1. Other proteins are involved in this process, and some of them are regulated to control iron absorption and storage. Excess iron can be stored in the mucosal cell as ferritin, a water-soluble complex consisting of a core of ferric hydroxide covered by a shell of a specialized storage protein called apoferritin. In general, when total body iron stores are high and iron requirements by the body are low, newly absorbed iron is diverted into ferritin in the intestinal mucosal cells. When iron stores are low or iron requirements are high, newly absorbed iron is immediately transported from the mucosal cells to the bone marrow to support hemoglobin production.

\section*{TRANSPORT}

Iron is transported in the plasma bound to transferrin, a B-globulin that specifically binds two molecules of ferrous iron (Figure 33-1). The transferrin-iron complex enters maturing erythroid cells by a specific receptor mechanism. Transferrin receptors-integral membrane glycoproteins present in large numbers on proliferating erythroid cells-bind and internalize the transferrin-iron complex through the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. In endosomes, the iron is released and funneled into hemoglobin synthesis, whereas the transferrin-transferrin receptor complex is recycled to the plasma membrane, where the transferrin dissociates and returns to the plasma. This process provides an efficient mechanism for supplying the iron required by developing red blood cells.

Increased erythropoiesis is associated with an increase in the number of transferrin receptors on developing erythroid cells. Iron store depletion and iron deficiency anemia are associated with an increased concentration of serum transferrin.

\section*{STORAGE}

In addition to the storage of iron in intestinal mucosal cells, iron is also stored, primarily as ferritin, in macrophages in the liver, spleen, and bone, and in parenchymal liver cells (Figure 33-1). Apoferritin synthesis is regulated by the levels of free iron. When these levels are low, apoferritin synthesis is inhibited and the balance of iron binding shifts toward transferrin. When free iron levels are high, more apoferritin is produced to sequester more iron and protect organs from the toxic effects of excess free iron.

Ferritin is detectable in serum. Since the ferritin present in serum is in equilibrium with storage ferritin in reticuloendothelial tissues, the serum ferritin level can be used to estimate total body iron stores.

\section*{ELI MI NATI ON}

There is no mechanism for excretion of iron. Small amounts are lost in the feces by exfoliation of intestinal mucosal cells, and trace amounts are excreted in bile, urine, and sweat. These losses account for no more than 1 mg of iron per day. Because the body's ability to excrete iron is so limited, regulation of iron balance must be achieved by changing intestinal absorption and storage of iron, in response to the body's needs. As noted below, impaired regulation of iron absorption leads to serious pathology.

\section*{Clinical Pharmacology}

\section*{INDI CATIONS FOR THE USE OF IRON}

The only clinical indication for the use of iron preparations is the treatment or prevention of iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency is commonly seen in populations with increased iron requirements. These include infants, especially premature infants; children during rapid growth periods; pregnant and lactating women;
and patients with chronic kidney disease who lose erythrocytes at a relatively high rate during hemodialysis and also form them at a high rate as a result of treatment with the erythrocyte growth factor erythropoietin (see below). Inadequate iron absorption can also cause iron deficiency. This is seen frequently after gastrectomy and in patients with severe small bowel disease that results in generalized malabsorption. Iron deficiency in these gastrointestinal conditions is due to inadequate iron absorption.

The most common cause of iron deficiency in adults is blood loss. Menstruating women lose about 30 mg of iron with each menstrual period; women with heavy menstrual bleeding may lose much more. Thus, many premenopausal women have low iron stores or even iron deficiency. In men and postmenopausal women, the most common site of blood loss is the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with unexplained iron deficiency anemia should be evaluated for occult gastrointestinal bleeding.

\section*{TREATMENT}

Iron deficiency anemia is treated with oral or parenteral iron preparations. Oral iron corrects the anemia just as rapidly and completely as parenteral iron in most cases if iron absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is normal. An exception is the high requirement for iron of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease who are undergoing hemodialysis and treatment with erythropoietin; for these patients, parenteral iron administration is preferred.

\section*{Oral Iron Therapy}

A wide variety of oral iron preparations are available. Because ferrous iron is most efficiently absorbed, only ferrous salts should be used. Ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, and ferrous fumarate are all effective and inexpensive and are recommended for the treatment of most patients.

Different iron salts provide different amounts of elemental iron, as shown in Table 33-2. In an iron-deficient individual, about $50-100 \mathrm{mg}$ of iron can be incorporated into hemoglobin daily, and about $25 \%$ of oral iron given as ferrous salt can be absorbed. Therefore, $200-400 \mathrm{mg}$ of elemental iron should be given daily to correct iron deficiency most rapidly. Patients unable to tolerate such large doses of iron can be given lower daily doses of iron, which results in slower but still complete correction of iron deficiency. Treatment with oral iron should be continued for 3-6 months after correction of the cause of the iron loss. This corrects the anemia and replenishes iron stores.

Common adverse effects of oral iron therapy include nausea, epigastric discomfort, abdominal cramps, constipation, and diarrhea. These effects are usually dose-related and can often be overcome by lowering the daily dose of iron or by taking the tablets immediately after or with meals. Some patients have less severe gastrointestinal adverse effects with one iron salt than another and benefit from changing preparations. Patients taking oral iron develop black stools; this has no clinical significance in itself but may obscure the diagnosis of continued gastrointestinal blood loss.

\section*{Parenteral Iron Therapy}

Parenteral therapy should be reserved for patients with documented iron deficiency who are unable to tolerate or absorb oral iron and for patients with extensive chronic blood loss who cannot be maintained with oral iron alone. This includes patients with various postgastrectomy conditions and previous small bowel resection, inflammatory bowel disease involving the proximal small bowel, malabsorption syndromes, and advanced chronic renal disease including hemodialysis and treatment with erythropoietin.

I ron dextran is a stable complex of ferric hydroxide and low-molecular-weight dextran containing 50 mg of elemental iron per milliliter of solution. It can be given by deep intramuscular injection or by intravenous infusion, although the intravenous route is used most commonly. Intravenous administration eliminates the local pain and tissue staining that often occur with the intramuscular route and allows delivery of the entire dose of iron necessary to correct the iron deficiency at one time. Adverse effects of intravenous iron dextran therapy include headache, light-headedness, fever, arthralgias, nausea and vomiting, back pain, flushing, urticaria, bronchospasm, and, rarely, anaphylaxis and death. Some of these effects represent a hypersensitivity reaction to the dextran component. Hypersensitivity reactions may be delayed for 48-72 hours after administration. Anaphylactic reactions to iron dextran, including fatal reactions, have been clearly documented. Owing to the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction, a small test dose of iron dextran should always be given before full intramuscular or intravenous doses are given. Patients with a strong
history of allergy and patients who have previously received parenteral iron dextran are more likely to have hypersensitivity reactions after treatment with parenteral iron dextran.

Iron-sucrose complex and iron sodium gluconate complex are alternative preparations. These agents can be given only by the intravenous route. These preparations appear to be much less likely than iron dextran to cause hypersensitivity reactions.

For patients who are treated chronically with parenteral iron, it is important to periodically monitor iron storage levels to avoid the serious toxicity associated with iron overload. Unlike oral iron therapy, which is subject to the regulatory mechanism provided by the intestinal uptake system, parenteral administration, which bypasses this regulatory system, can deliver more iron than can be safely stored in intestinal cells and macrophages in the liver and tissues. Iron stores can be estimated on the basis of serum concentrations of ferritin and the transferrin saturation, which is the ratio of the total serum iron concentration to the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC).

\section*{Clinical Toxicity}

\section*{ACUTE IRON TOXICITY}

Acute iron toxicity is seen almost exclusively in young children who accidentally ingest iron tablets. Although adults are able to tolerate large doses of oral iron without serious consequences, as few as 10 tablets of any of the commonly available oral iron preparations can be lethal in young children. Adult patients taking oral iron preparations should be instructed to store tablets in child-proof containers out of the reach of children. Children who are poisoned with oral iron experience necrotizing gastroenteritis, with vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea followed by shock, lethargy, and dyspnea. Subsequently, improvement is often noted, but this may be followed by severe metabolic acidosis, coma, and death. Urgent treatment is necessary. Whole bowel irrigation (see Chapter 59) should be performed to flush out unabsorbed pills. Deferoxamine, a potent iron-chelating compound, can be given systemically to bind iron that has already been absorbed and to promote its excretion in urine and feces. Activated charcoal, a highly effective adsorbent for most toxins, does not bind iron and thus is ineffective. Appropriate supportive therapy for gastrointestinal bleeding, metabolic acidosis, and shock must also be provided.

\section*{CHRONIC IRON TOXI CITY}

Chronic iron toxicity (iron overload), also known as hemochromatosis, results when excess iron is deposited in the heart, liver, pancreas, and other organs. It can lead to organ failure and death. It most commonly occurs in patients with inherited hemochromatosis, a disorder characterized by excessive iron absorption, and in patients who receive many red cell transfusions over a long period of time (eg, patients with thalassemia major).

Chronic iron overload in the absence of anemia is most efficiently treated by intermittent phlebotomy. One unit of blood can be removed every week or so until all of the excess iron is removed. Iron chelation therapy using parenteral deferoxamine is much less efficient as well as more complicated, expensive, and hazardous, but it can be the only option for iron overload that cannot be managed by phlebotomy, such as the iron overload experienced by patients with thalassemia major.

Recently, an oral iron chelator deferasirox has been approved for treatment of iron overload. Deferasirox appears to be as effective as deferoxamine at reducing liver iron concentrations and is much more convenient. However, it is not clear whether deferasirox is as effective as deferoxamine at protecting the heart from iron overload.

\section*{VITAMI N B ${ }_{12}$}

Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ serves as a cofactor for several essential biochemical reactions in humans. Deficiency of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ leads to anemia, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neurologic abnormalities. Although deficiency of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ due to an inadequate supply in the diet is unusual, deficiency of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ in adults-especially older adults-due to inadequate absorption of dietary vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is a relatively common and easily treated disorder.

\section*{Chemistry}

Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ consists of a porphyrin-like ring with a central cobalt atom attached to a nucleotide. Various organic groups may be covalently bound to the cobalt atom, forming different cobalamins.
Deoxyadenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin are the active forms of the vitamin in humans.
Cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin (both available for therapeutic use) and other cobalamins found in food sources are converted to the active forms. The ultimate source of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is from microbial synthesis; the vitamin is not synthesized by animals or plants. The chief dietary source of vitamin $B_{12}$ is microbially derived vitamin $B_{12}$ in meat (especially liver), eggs, and dairy products. Vitamin $B_{12}$ is sometimes called extrinsic factor to differentiate it from intrinsic factor, a protein normally secreted by the stomach.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

The average diet in the USA contains $5-30 \mathrm{mcg}$ of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ daily, $1-5 \mathrm{mcg}$ of which is usually absorbed. The vitamin is avidly stored, primarily in the liver, with an average adult having a total vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ storage pool of 3000-5000 mcg. Only trace amounts of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ are normally lost in urine and stool. Because the normal daily requirements of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ are only about 2 mcg , it would take about 5 years for all of the stored vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ to be exhausted and for megaloblastic anemia to develop if $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ absorption stopped. Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ in physiologic amounts is absorbed only after it complexes with intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the parietal cells of the gastric mucosa. Intrinsic factor combines with the vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ that is liberated from dietary sources in the stomach and duodenum, and the intrinsic factor-vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ complex is subsequently absorbed in the distal ileum by a highly specific receptor-mediated transport system. Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency in humans most often results from malabsorption of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ due either to lack of intrinsic factor or to loss or malfunction of the specific absorptive mechanism in the distal ileum. Nutritional deficiency is rare but may be seen in strict vegetarians after many years without meat, eggs, or dairy products.

Once absorbed, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is transported to the various cells of the body bound to a plasma glycoprotein, transcobalamin II. Excess vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is transported to the liver for storage.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Two essential enzymatic reactions in humans require vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ (Figure 33-2). In one, methylcobalamin serves as an intermediate in the transfer of a methyl group from $\mathrm{N}^{5}$-methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, forming methionine (Figure 33-2A; Figure 33-3, section 1). Without vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, conversion of the major dietary and storage folate, $\mathrm{N}^{5}$-methyltetrahydrofolate, to tetrahydrofolate, the precursor of folate cofactors, cannot occur. As a result, a deficiency of folate cofactors necessary for several biochemical reactions involving the transfer of one-carbon groups develops. In particular, the depletion of tetrahydrofolate prevents synthesis of adequate supplies of the deoxythymidylate (dTMP) and purines required for DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, as shown in Figure 33-3, section 2. The accumulation of
folate as N ${ }^{5}$-methyltetrahydrofolate and the associated depletion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors in vitamin $B_{12}$ deficiency have been referred to as the "methylfolate trap." This is the biochemical step whereby vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folic acid metabolism are linked, and it explains why the megaloblastic anemia of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency can be partially corrected by ingestion of relatively large amounts of folic acid. Folic acid can be reduced to dihydrofolate by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (Figure 33-3, reaction 3) and thus serve as a source of the tetrahydrofolate required for synthesis of the purines and dTMP that are needed for DNA synthesis.

Enzymatic reactions that use folates. Section 1 shows the vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$-dependent reaction that allows most dietary folates to enter the tetrahydrofolate cofactor pool and becomes the "folate trap" in vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency. Section 2 shows the dTMP cycle. Section 3 shows the pathway by which folic acid enters the tetrahydrofolate cofactor pool. Double arrows indicate pathways with more than one intermediate step.

The other enzymatic reaction that requires vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinylCoA by the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (Figure 33-2B). In vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency, this conversion cannot take place, and the substrate, methylmalonyl-CoA, accumulates. In the past, it was thought that abnormal accumulation of methylmalonyl-CoA causes the neurologic manifestations of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency. However, newer evidence instead implicates the disruption of the methionine synthesis pathway as the cause of neurologic problems. Whatever the biochemical explanation for neurologic damage, the important point is that administration of folic acid in the setting of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency will not prevent neurologic manifestations even though it will largely correct the anemia caused by the vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency.

\section*{Clinical Pharmacology}

Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is used to treat or prevent deficiency. There is no evidence that vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ injections have any benefit in persons who do not have vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency. The most characteristic clinical manifestation of vitamin $B_{12}$ deficiency is megaloblastic anemia. The typical clinical findings in megaloblastic anemia are macrocytic anemia, often with associated mild or moderate leukopenia or thrombocytopenia (or both), and a characteristic hypercellular bone marrow with an accumulation of megaloblastic erythroid and other precursor cells. The neurologic syndrome associated with vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency usually begins with paresthesias and weakness in peripheral nerves and progresses to spasticity, ataxia, and other central nervous system dysfunctions. Correction of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency arrests the progression of neurologic disease, but it may not fully reverse neurologic symptoms that have been present for several months. Although most patients with neurologic abnormalities caused by vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency have megaloblastic anemia when first seen, occasional patients have few if any hematologic abnormalities.

Once a diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia is made, it must be determined whether vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ or folic acid deficiency is the cause. (Other causes of megaloblastic anemia are very rare.) This can usually be accomplished by measuring serum levels of the vitamins. The Schilling test, which measures absorption and urinary excretion of radioactively labeled vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, can be used to further define the mechanism of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ malabsorption when this is found to be the cause of the megaloblastic anemia.

The most common causes of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency are pernicious anemia, partial or total gastrectomy, and conditions that affect the distal ileum, such as malabsorption syndromes, inflammatory bowel disease, or small bowel resection.

Pernicious anemia results from defective secretion of intrinsic factor by the gastric mucosal cells. Patients with pernicious anemia have gastric atrophy and fail to secrete intrinsic factor (as well as hydrochloric acid). The Schilling test shows diminished absorption of radioactively labeled vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, which is corrected when intrinsic factor is administered with radioactive $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, since the vitamin can then be normally absorbed.

Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency also occurs when the region of the distal ileum that absorbs the vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$-intrinsic factor complex is damaged, as when the ileum is involved with inflammatory bowel disease or when the ileum is surgically resected. In these situations, radioactively labeled vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is not absorbed in the Schilling test, even when intrinsic factor is added. Other rare causes of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency include bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel, chronic pancreatitis, and thyroid disease. Rare cases of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency in children have been found to be secondary to congenital deficiency of intrinsic factor and congenital selective vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ malabsorption due to defects of the receptor sites in the distal ileum.

Almost all cases of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency are caused by malabsorption of the vitamin; therefore, parenteral injections of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ are required for therapy. For patients with potentially reversible diseases, the underlying disease should be treated after initial treatment with parenteral vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$. Most patients, however, do not have curable deficiency syndromes and require lifelong treatment with vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$.

Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ for parenteral injection is available as cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin. Hydroxocobalamin is preferred because it is more highly protein-bound and therefore remains longer in the circulation. Initial therapy should consist of $100-1000 \mathrm{mcg}$ of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ intramuscularly daily or every other day for 1-2 weeks to replenish body stores. Maintenance therapy consists of $100-1000 \mathrm{mcg}$ intramuscularly once a month for life. If neurologic abnormalities are present, maintenance therapy injections should be given every 1-2 weeks for 6 months before switching to monthly injections. Oral vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$-intrinsic factor
mixtures and liver extracts should not be used to treat vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency; however, oral doses of 1000 mcg of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ daily are usually sufficient to treat patients with pernicious anemia who refuse or cannot tolerate the injections. After pernicious anemia is in remission following parenteral vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ therapy, the vitamin can be administered intranasally as a spray or gel.

\section*{FOLIC ACID}

Reduced forms of folic acid are required for essential biochemical reactions that provide precursors for the synthesis of amino acids, purines, and DNA. Folate deficiency is not uncommon, even though the deficiency is easily corrected by administration of folic acid. The consequences of folate deficiency go beyond the problem of anemia because folate deficiency is implicated as a cause of congenital malformations in newborns and may play a role in vascular disease (see Folic Acid Supplementation: A Public Health Dilemma).

\section*{Folic Acid Supplementation: A Public Health Dilemma}

Starting in January 1998, all products made from enriched grains in the USA were required to be supplemented with folic acid. This FDA ruling was issued to reduce the incidence of congenital neural tube defects. Epidemiologic studies show a strong correlation between maternal folic acid deficiency and the incidence of neural tube defects such as spina bifida and anencephaly. The FDA requirement for folic acid supplementation is a public health measure aimed at the significant number of women in the USA who do not receive prenatal care and are not aware of the importance of adequate folic acid ingestion for preventing birth defects in their babies.

There may be an added benefit for adults. N ${ }^{5}$-Methyltetrahydrofolate is required for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine (Figure 33-2; Figure 33-3, reaction 1). I mpaired synthesis of N 5 methyltetrahydrofolate results in elevated serum concentrations of homocysteine. Data from several sources suggest a positive correlation between elevated serum homocysteine and occlusive vascular diseases such as ischemic heart disease and stroke. Clinical data suggest that the folate supplementation program has improved the folate status and reduced the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in a population of middle-aged and older adults who did not use vitamin supplements. It is possible, although the evidence thus far has been negative, that the increased ingestion of folic acid will also reduce the risk of vascular disease in this population.

Although the potential benefits of supplemental folic acid during pregnancy are compelling, the decision to require folic acid in grains was-and still is-controversial. As described in the text, ingestion of folic acid can partially or totally correct the anemia caused by vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency. However, folic acid supplementation does not prevent the potentially irreversible neurologic damage caused by vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency. People with pernicious anemia and other forms of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency are usually identified because of signs and symptoms of anemia, which typically occur before neurologic symptoms. The opponents of folic acid supplementation are concerned that increased folic acid intake in the general population will mask vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency and increase the prevalence of neurologic disease in our elderly population. To put this in perspective, approximately 4000 pregnancies, including 2500 live births, in the USA each year are affected by neural tube defects. In contrast, it is estimated that over 10\% of the elderly population in the USA, or several million people, are at risk for the neuropsychiatric complications of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency. In acknowledgment of this controversy, the FDA has kept its requirements for folic acid supplementation at a somewhat low level.

\section*{Chemistry}

Folic acid (pteroylglutamic acid) is composed of a heterocycle (pteridine), p- aminobenzoic acid, and glutamic acid (Figure 33-4). Various numbers of glutamic acid moieties may be attached to the pteroyl portion of the molecule, resulting in monoglutamates, triglutamates, or polyglutamates. Folic acid can undergo reduction, catalyzed by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase ("folate reductase"), to give dihydrofolic acid (Figure 33-3, section 3). Tetrahydrofolate can subsequently be transformed to folate cofactors possessing one-carbon units attached to the 5-nitrogen, to the 10-nitrogen, or to both positions (Figure 33-3). The folate cofactors are interconvertible by various enzymatic reactions and serve the important biochemical function of donating one-carbon units at various levels of oxidation. In most of these, tetrahydrofolate is regenerated and becomes available for reutilization.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

The average diet in the USA contains $500-700 \mathrm{mcg}$ of folates daily, $50-200 \mathrm{mcg}$ of which is usually absorbed, depending on metabolic requirements. Pregnant women may absorb as much as $300-400 \mathrm{mcg}$ of folic acid daily. Various forms of folic acid are present in a wide variety of plant and animal tissues; the richest sources are yeast, liver, kidney, and green vegetables. Normally, $5-20 \mathrm{mg}$ of folates are stored in the liver and other tissues. Folates are excreted in the urine and stool and are also destroyed by catabolism, so serum levels fall within a few days when intake is diminished. Because body stores of folates are relatively low and daily requirements high, folic acid deficiency and megaloblastic anemia can develop within 1-6 months after the intake of folic acid stops, depending on the patient's nutritional status and the rate of folate utilization.

Unaltered folic acid is readily and completely absorbed in the proximal jejunum. Dietary folates, however, consist primarily of polyglutamate forms of $\mathrm{N}^{5}$-methyltetrahydrofolate. Before absorption, all but one of the glutamyl residues of the polyglutamates must be hydrolyzed by the enzyme a-1-glutamyl transferase
("conjugase") within the brush border of the intestinal mucosa. The monoglutamate N ${ }^{5}$ methyltetrahydrofolate is subsequently transported into the bloodstream by both active and passive transport and is then widely distributed throughout the body. Inside cells, N ${ }^{5}$-methyltetrahydrofolate is converted to tetrahydrofolate by the demethylation reaction that requires vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ (Figure 33-3, section $1)$.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Tetrahydrofolate cofactors participate in one-carbon transfer reactions. As described earlier in the discussion of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, one of these essential reactions produces the dTMP needed for DNA synthesis. In this reaction, the enzyme thymidylate synthase catalyzes the transfer of the one-carbon unit of $\mathrm{N}^{5}, \mathrm{~N}^{10}$ methylenetetrahydrofolate to deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to form dTMP (Figure 33-3, section 2). Unlike all the other enzymatic reactions that use folate cofactors, in this reaction the cofactor is oxidized to dihydrofolate, and for each mole of dTMP produced, 1 mole of tetrahydrofolate is consumed. In rapidly proliferating tissues, considerable amounts of tetrahydrofolate are consumed in this reaction, and continued DNA synthesis requires continued regeneration of tetrahydrofolate by reduction of dihydrofolate, catalyzed by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. The tetrahydrofolate thus produced can then reform the cofactor N 5 , N ${ }^{10}$-methylenetetrahydrofolate by the action of serine transhydroxymethylase and thus allow for the continued synthesis of dTMP. The combined catalytic activities of dTMP synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and serine transhydroxymethylase are often referred to as the dTMP synthesis cycle. Enzymes in the dTMP cycle are the targets of two anticancer drugs; methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, and a metabolite of 5-fluorouracil inhibits thymidylate synthase (see Chapter 55).

Cofactors of tetrahydrofolate participate in several other essential reactions. N 5 -Methylenetetrahydrofolate is required for the vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$-dependent reaction that generates methionine from homocysteine (Figure 33-2A; Figure 33-3, section 1). In addition, tetrahydrofolate cofactors donate one-carbon units during the de novo synthesis of essential purines. In these reactions, tetrahydrofolate is regenerated and can reenter the tetrahydrofolate cofactor pool.

\section*{Clinical Pharmacology}

Folate deficiency results in a megaloblastic anemia that is microscopically indistinguishable from the anemia caused by vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency (see above). However, folate deficiency does not cause the characteristic neurologic syndrome seen in vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency. In patients with megaloblastic anemia, folate status is assessed with assays for serum folate or for red blood cell folate. Red blood cell folate levels are often of greater diagnostic value than serum levels, because serum folate levels tend to be labile and do not necessarily reflect tissue levels.

Folic acid deficiency, unlike vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency, is often caused by inadequate dietary intake of folates. Patients with alcohol dependence and patients with liver disease often develop folic acid deficiency because of poor diet and diminished hepatic storage of folates. Pregnant women and patients with hemolytic anemia have increased folate requirements and may become folic acid-deficient, especially if their diets are marginal. Evidence implicates maternal folic acid deficiency in the occurrence of fetal neural tube defects, eg, spina bifida. (See Folic Acid Supplementation: A Public Health Dilemma.) Patients with malabsorption syndromes also frequently develop folic acid deficiency. Patients who require renal dialysis develop folic acid deficiency because folates are removed from the plasma during the dialysis procedure.

Folic acid deficiency can be caused by drugs. Methotrexate and, to a lesser extent, trimethoprim and
pyrimethamine, inhibit dihydrofolate reductase and may result in a deficiency of folate cofactors and ultimately in megaloblastic anemia. Long-term therapy with phenytoin can also cause folate deficiency, but only rarely causes megaloblastic anemia.

Parenteral administration of folic acid is rarely necessary, since oral folic acid is well absorbed even in patients with malabsorption syndromes. A dose of 1 mg folic acid orally daily is sufficient to reverse megaloblastic anemia, restore normal serum folate levels, and replenish body stores of folates in almost all patients. Therapy should be continued until the underlying cause of the deficiency is removed or corrected. Therapy may be required indefinitely for patients with malabsorption or dietary inadequacy. Folic acid supplementation to prevent folic acid deficiency should be considered in high-risk patients, including pregnant women, patients with alcohol dependence, hemolytic anemia, liver disease, or certain skin diseases, and patients on renal dialysis.

\section*{HEMATOPOI ETI C GROWTH FACTORS}

The hematopoietic growth factors are glycoprotein hormones that regulate the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow. The first growth factors to be identified were called colony-stimulating factors because they could stimulate the growth of colonies of various bone marrow progenitor cells in vitro. Many of these growth factors have been purified and cloned, and their effects on hematopoiesis have been extensively studied. Quantities of these growth factors sufficient for clinical use are produced by recombinant DNA technology.

Of the known hematopoietic growth factors, erythropoietin (epoetin alfa), granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interleukin-11 (IL-11) are currently in clinical use. Thrombopoietin and other potentially useful hematopoietic factors are still in development.

The hematopoietic growth factors have complex effects on the function of a wide variety of cell types, including nonhematologic cells. Their usefulness in other areas of medicine, particularly as potential anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs, is being investigated.

\section*{ERYTHROPOI ETI N}

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Erythropoietin, a 34-39 kDa glycoprotein, was the first human hematopoietic growth factor to be isolated. It was originally purified from the urine of patients with severe anemia. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO, epoetin alfa) is produced in a mammalian cell expression system. After intravenous administration, erythropoietin has a serum half-life of $4-13$ hours in patients with chronic renal failure. It is not cleared by dialysis. It is measured in international units (IU). Darbepoetin alfa is a glycosylated form of erythropoietin and differs from it functionally only in having a twofold to threefold longer half-life.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Erythropoietin stimulates erythroid proliferation and differentiation by interacting with specific erythropoietin receptors on red cell progenitors. The erythropoietin receptor is a member of the JAK/STAT superfamily of cytokine receptors that use protein phosphorylation and transcription factor activation to regulate cellular function (see Chapter 2). Erythropoietin also induces release of reticulocytes from the bone marrow. Endogenous erythropoietin is primarily produced in the kidney. In response to tissue hypoxia,
more erythropoietin is produced through an increased rate of transcription of the erythropoietin gene. This results in correction of the anemia, provided that the bone marrow response is not impaired by red cell nutritional deficiency (especially iron deficiency), primary bone marrow disorders (see below), or bone marrow suppression from drugs or chronic diseases.

Normally, an inverse relationship exists between the hematocrit or hemoglobin level and the serum erythropoietin level. Nonanemic individuals have serum erythropoietin levels of less than $20 \mathrm{IU} / \mathrm{L}$. As the hematocrit and hemoglobin levels fall and anemia becomes more severe, the serum erythropoietin level rises exponentially. Patients with moderately severe anemias usually have erythropoietin levels in the 100-500 IU/L range, and patients with severe anemias may have levels of thousands of IU/L. The most important exception to this inverse relationship is in the anemia of chronic renal failure. In patients with renal disease, erythropoietin levels are usually low because the kidneys cannot produce the growth factor. These are the patients most likely to respond to treatment with exogenous erythropoietin. In most primary bone marrow disorders (aplastic anemia, leukemias, myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic disorders, etc) and most nutritional and secondary anemias, endogenous erythropoietin levels are high, so there is less likelihood of a response to exogenous erythropoietin (but see below).

\section*{Clinical Pharmacology}

The availability of erythropoietin has had a significant positive impact for patients with anemia of chronic renal failure (Table 33-3). Erythropoietin consistently improves the hematocrit and hemoglobin level and usually eliminates the need for transfusions in these patients. An increase in reticulocyte count is usually observed in about 10 days and an increase in hematocrit and hemoglobin levels in 2-6 weeks. Most patients can maintain a hematocrit of about $35 \%$ with erythropoietin doses of $50-150 \mathrm{IU} / \mathrm{kg}$ intravenously or subcutaneously three times a week. Failure to respond to erythropoietin is most commonly due to concurrent iron deficiency, which can be corrected by giving oral or parenteral iron. Folate supplementation may also be necessary in some patients.

In selected patients, erythropoietin may also be useful for the treatment of anemia due to primary bone marrow disorders and secondary anemias. This includes patients with aplastic anemia and other bone marrow failure states, myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic disorders, multiple myeloma and perhaps other chronic bone marrow malignancies, and the anemias associated with chronic inflammation, AIDS, and cancer. Patients with these disorders who have disproportionately low serum erythropoietin levels for their degree of anemia are most likely to respond to treatment with this growth factor. Patients with endogenous erythropoietin levels of less than $100 \mathrm{IU} / \mathrm{L}$ have the best chance of response, although patients with erythropoietin levels between 100 and 500 IU/L respond occasionally. These patients generally require higher erythropoietin doses (150-300 IU/kg three times a week) to achieve a response, and responses are often incomplete.

Erythropoietin has been used successfully to offset the anemia produced by zidovudine treatment in patients with HIV infection and in the treatment of the anemia of prematurity. It can also be used to accelerate erythropoiesis after phlebotomies for autologous transfusion for elective surgery, or for treatment of iron overload (hemochromatosis).

Erythropoietin is one of the drugs banned by the International Olympic Committee. The use of erythropoietin by athletes is based on their hope that increased red blood cell concentration will increase oxygen delivery and improve performance.

\section*{Toxicity}

The most common adverse effects of erythropoietin are associated with a rapid increase in hematocrit and hemoglobin and include hypertension and thrombotic complications. These difficulties can be minimized by raising the hematocrit and hemoglobin slowly and by adequately monitoring and treating hypertension. Allergic reactions have been infrequent and mild.

\section*{MYELOID GROWTH FACTORS}

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

G-CSF and GM-CSF, the two myeloid growth factors currently available for clinical use, were originally
purified from cultured human cell lines (Table 33-3). Recombinant human G-CSF (rHuG-CSF; filgrastim) is produced in a bacterial expression system. It is a nonglycosylated peptide of 175 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 18 kDa . Recombinant human GM-CSF (rHuGM-CSF; sargramostim) is produced in a yeast expression system. It is a partially glycosylated peptide of 127 amino acids, with three molecular species with molecular weights of 15,$500 ; 15,800$; and 19,500 . These preparations have serum half-lives of 2-7 hours after intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Pegfilgrastim, a covalent conjugation product of filgrastim and a form of polyethylene glycol, has a much longer serum half-life than recombinant G-CSF, and so it can be injected once per myelosuppressive chemotherapy cycle instead of daily for several days.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

The myeloid growth factors stimulate proliferation and differentiation by interacting with specific receptors found on various myeloid progenitor cells. Like the erythropoietin receptor, these receptors are members of the JAK/STAT superfamily (see Chapter 2). G-CSF stimulates proliferation and differentiation of progenitors already committed to the neutrophil lineage. It also activates the phagocytic activity of mature neutrophils and prolongs their survival in the circulation. G-CSF also has a remarkable ability to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells, ie, to increase their concentration in peripheral blood. This biologic effect underlies a major advance in transplantation-the use of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) rather than bone marrow stem cells for autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (see below).

GM-CSF has broader biologic actions than G-CSF. It is a multipotential hematopoietic growth factor that stimulates proliferation and differentiation of early and late granulocytic progenitor cells as well as erythroid and megakaryocyte progenitors. Like G-CSF, GM-CSF also stimulates the function of mature neutrophils. GM-CSF acts together with interleukin- 2 to stimulate T-cell proliferation and appears to be a locally active factor at the site of inflammation. GM-CSF mobilizes peripheral blood stem cells, but it is significantly less efficacious than G-CSF in this regard.

\section*{Clinical Pharmacology}

\section*{CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NEUTROPENIA}

Neutropenia is a common adverse effect of the cytotoxic drugs used to treat cancer and increases the risk of serious infection in patients receiving chemotherapy. Unlike the treatment of anemia and thrombocytopenia, transfusion of neutropenic patients with granulocytes collected from donors is performed rarely and with limited success. The introduction of G-CSF in 1991 represented a milestone in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. This growth factor dramatically accelerates the rate of neutrophil recovery after dose-intensive myelosuppressive chemotherapy (Figure 33-5). It reduces the duration of neutropenia and usually raises the nadir count, the lowest neutrophil count seen following a cycle of chemotherapy.
Figure 33-5.

Effects of G-CSF (color) or placebo (black line) on absolute neutrophil count (ANC) after cytotoxic chemotherapy for lung cancer. Doses of chemotherapeutic drugs were administered on days 1 and 3. G-CSF or placebo injections were started on day 4 and continued daily through day 12 or 16. The first peak in ANC reflects the recruitment of mature cells by G-CSF. The second peak reflects a marked increase in new neutrophil production by the bone marrow under stimulation by G-CSF. (Normal ANC is 2.2-8.6 $\times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$.) (Modified and reproduced, with permission, from Crawford et al: Reduction by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor of fever and neutropenia induced by chemotherapy in patients with small-cell lung cancer. N Engl J Med 1991; 325: 164.)

The ability of G-CSF to increase neutrophil counts after myelosuppressive chemotherapy is nearly universal, but its impact on clinical outcomes is more variable. Some clinical trials have shown that G-CSF reduces episodes of febrile neutropenia, requirements for broad-spectrum antibiotics, and days of hospitalization; however, other trials failed to find these favorable outcomes. To date, no clinical trial has shown improved survival in cancer patients treated with G-CSF. Clinical guidelines for the use of G-CSF after cytotoxic chemotherapy recommend reserving G-CSF for patients with a prior episode of febrile neutropenia after cytotoxic chemotherapy, patients receiving dose-intensive chemotherapy, patients at high risk for febrile neutropenia, and patients who are unlikely to survive an episode of febrile neutropenia. Pegfilgrastim is an alternative to G-CSF for prevention of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia. Pegfilgrastim can be administered less frequently, and it may shorten the period of severe neutropenia slightly more than GCSF.

Like G-CSF and pegfilgrastim, GM-CSF also reduces the duration of neutropenia after cytotoxic chemotherapy. It has been more difficult to show that GM-CSF reduces the incidence of febrile neutropenia, probably because GM-CSF itself can induce fever. In the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, G-CSF, $5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$, or GM-CSF, $250 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{m}^{2} / \mathrm{d}$, is usually started within 24-72 hours after completing chemotherapy and is continued until the absolute neutrophil count is $>10,000$ cells $/ \mu \mathrm{L}$. Pegfilgrastim is given as a single dose instead of daily injections.

The utility and safety of the myeloid growth factors in the postchemotherapy supportive care of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been the subject of a number of clinical trials. Because leukemic cells arise from progenitors whose proliferation and differentiation are normally regulated by hematopoietic growth factors, including GM-CSF and G-CSF, there was concern that myeloid growth factors could stimulate leukemic cell growth and increase the rate of relapse. The results of randomized clinical trials suggest that both G-CSF and GM-CSF are safe following induction and consolidation treatment of myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia. There has been no evidence that these growth factors reduce the rate of remission or increase relapse rate. On the contrary, the growth factors accelerate neutrophil recovery and reduce infection rates and days of hospitalization. Both G-CSF and GM-CSF have FDA approval for
treatment of patients with AML.

\section*{OTHER APPLICATIONS}

G-CSF and GM-CSF have also proved to be effective in treating the neutropenia associated with congenital neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia, myelodysplasia, and aplastic anemia. Many patients with these disorders respond with a prompt and sometimes dramatic increase in neutrophil count. In some cases, this results in a decrease in the frequency of infections. Because neither G-CSF nor GM-CSF stimulates the formation of erythrocytes and platelets, they are sometimes combined with other growth factors for treatment of pancytopenia.

The myeloid growth factors play an important role in autologous stem cell transplantation for patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support is increasingly used to treat patients with tumors that are resistant to standard doses of chemotherapeutic drugs. The high-dose regimens produce extreme myelosuppression; the myelosuppression is then counteracted by reinfusion of the patient's own hematopoietic stem cells (which are collected prior to chemotherapy). The administration of G-CSF or GM-CSF early after autologous stem cell transplantation has been shown to reduce the time to engraftment and to recovery from neutropenia in patients receiving stem cells obtained either from bone marrow or from peripheral blood. These effects are seen in patients being treated for lymphoma or for solid tumors. G-CSF and GM-CSF are also used to support patients who have received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for treatment of hematologic malignancies or bone marrow failure states. In this setting, the growth factors speed the recovery from neutropenia without increasing the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease.

Perhaps the most important role of the myeloid growth factors in transplantation is for mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs). Stem cells collected from peripheral blood have nearly replaced bone marrow as the hematopoietic preparation used for autologous transplantation, and the use of PBSCs for allogeneic transplantation is also being investigated. The cells can be collected in an outpatient setting with a procedure that avoids much of the risk and discomfort of bone marrow collection, including the need for general anesthesia. In addition, there is evidence that PBSC transplantation results in more rapid engraftment of all hematopoietic cell lineages and in reduced rates of graft failure or delayed platelet recovery.

G-CSF is the cytokine most commonly used for PBSC mobilization because of its increased efficacy and reduced toxicity compared with GM-CSF. To mobilize stem cells, patients or donors are given 5-10 $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ subcutaneously for 4 days. On the fifth day, they undergo leukapheresis. The success of PBSC transplantation depends on transfusion of adequate numbers of stem cells. CD34, an antigen present on early progenitor cells and absent from later, committed, cells, is used as a marker for the requisite stem cells. The goal is to reinfuse at least $5 \times 10^{6}$ CD34 cells/kg; this number of CD34 cells usually results in prompt and durable engraftment of all cell lineages. It can take several separate leukaphereses to collect enough CD34 cells, especially from older patients and patients who have been exposed to radiation therapy or chemotherapy.

\section*{Toxicity}

Although the two growth factors have similar effects on neutrophil counts, G-CSF is used more frequently because it is better tolerated. G-CSF can cause bone pain, which clears when the drug is discontinued. GMCSF can cause more severe side effects, particularly at higher doses. These include fever, malaise,
arthralgias, myalgias, and a capillary leak syndrome characterized by peripheral edema and pleural or pericardial effusions. Allergic reactions may occur but are infrequent. Splenic rupture is a rare but serious complication of the use of G-CSF for PBSC.

\section*{MEGAKARYOCYTE GROWTH FACTORS}

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a 65-85 kDa protein produced by fibroblasts and stromal cells in the bone marrow. Oprelvekin, the recombinant form of interleukin-11 approved for clinical use (Table 33-3), is produced by expression in E coli. The half-life of IL-11 is 7-8 hours when the drug is injected subcutaneously.

Thrombopoietin, a 65-85 kDa glycosylated protein, is constitutively expressed by a variety of organs and cell types. Hepatocytes appear to be the major source of human thrombopoietin, and patients with cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia have low serum thrombopoietin levels. Recombinant thrombopoietin is produced by expression in human cells; the recombinant product contains two intramolecular disulfide bonds and a number of carbohydrate side chains.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Interleukin-11 acts through a specific cell surface cytokine receptor to stimulate the growth of multiple lymphoid and myeloid cells. It acts synergistically with other growth factors to stimulate the growth of primitive megakaryocytic progenitors and, most importantly, increases the number of peripheral platelets and neutrophils.

Acting through its own cytokine receptor, thrombopoietin also independently stimulates the growth of primitive megakaryocytic progenitors. In addition, it stimulates mature megakaryocytes and even activates mature platelets to respond to aggregation-inducing stimuli. The critical in vivo role of thrombopoietin has been demonstrated in genetically engineered knockout mice who lack either thrombopoietin or its receptor. These mice have marked thrombocytopenia but do not display anemia or leukopenia.

\section*{Clinical Pharmacology}

Patients with thrombocytopenia have a high risk of hemorrhage. Although platelet transfusion is commonly used to treat thrombocytopenia, this procedure can cause adverse reactions in the recipient; furthermore, a significant number of patients fail to exhibit the expected increase in platelet count.

Interleukin-11 is the first growth factor to gain FDA approval for treatment of thrombocytopenia. It is approved for the secondary prevention of thrombocytopenia in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for treatment of nonmyeloid cancers. Clinical trials show that it reduces the number of platelet transfusions required by patients who experience severe thrombocytopenia after a previous cycle of chemotherapy. Although IL-11 has broad stimulatory effects on hematopoietic cell lineages in vitro, it does not appear to have significant effects on the leukopenia caused by myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Interleukin-11 is given by subcutaneous injection at a dose of $50 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. It is started 6-24 hours after completion of chemotherapy and continued for 14-21 days or until the platelet count passes the nadir and rises to > 50,000 cells/H.L.

Recombinant thrombopoietin is still an investigational agent. The primary focus of current clinical trials is for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombocytopenia accompanying
hematologic stem cell transplantation.

\section*{Toxicity}

The most common adverse effects of interleukin-11 are fatigue, headache, dizziness, and cardiovascular effects. The cardiovascular effects include anemia (due to hemodilution), dyspnea (due to fluid accumulation in the lungs), and transient atrial arrhythmias. Hypokalemia has also been seen in some patients. All of these adverse effects appear to be reversible. In the limited clinical trial data available thus far, recombinant thrombopoietin appears to be well tolerated.

\section*{DRUGS USED IN DISORDERS OF COAGULATION: INTRODUCTION}

Hemostasis refers to the finely regulated dynamic process of maintaining fluidity of the blood, repairing vascular injury, and limiting blood loss while avoiding vessel occlusion (thrombosis) and inadequate perfusion of vital organs. Either extreme-excessive bleeding or thrombosis-represents a breakdown of the hemostatic mechanism. Common causes of dysregulated hemostasis include hereditary or acquired defects in the clotting mechanism and secondary effects of infection or cancer. The drugs used to limit abnormal bleeding and to inhibit thrombosis are the subjects of this chapter.

\section*{Mechanisms of Blood Coagulation}

The vascular endothelial cell layer lining blood vessels has an anticoagulant phenotype, and circulating blood platelets and clotting factors do not normally adhere to it to an appreciable extent. In the setting of vascular injury, the endothelial cell layer rapidly undergoes a series of changes resulting in a more procoagulant phenotype. Injury exposes reactive subendothelial matrix proteins such as collagen and von Willebrand factor, which results in platelet adherence and activation, and secretion and synthesis of vasoconstrictors and platelet-recruiting and activating molecules. Thus, thromboxane $\mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{2}}\left(\mathbf{T X A}_{\mathbf{2}}\right)$ is synthesized from arachadonic acid within platelets and is a platelet activator and potent vasoconstrictor. Products secreted from platelet granules include adenosine diphosphate (ADP), a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation, and serotonin (5-HT), which stimulates aggregation and vasoconstriction. Activation of platelets results in a conformational change in the $\alpha_{11 \mathrm{~b}} \beta_{111}$ integrin ( $11 \mathrm{~b} / 11 \mathrm{a}$ ) receptor, enabling it to bind fibrinogen, which cross-links adjacent platelets, resulting in aggregation and formation of a platelet plug (Figure 34-1). Simultaneously, the coagulation system cascade is activated, resulting in thrombin generation and a fibrin clot, which stabilizes the platelet plug (see below). Knowledge of the hemostatic mechanism is important for diagnosis of bleeding disorders. Patients with defects in the formation of the primary platelet plug (defects in primary hemostasis, eg, platelet function defects, von Willebrand disease) typically bleed from mucosal sites (gingiva, skin, heavy menses) with injury. In contrast, patients with defects in the clotting mechanism (secondary hemostasis, eg, hemophilia A) tend to bleed into deep tissues (joints, muscle, retroperitoneum), often with no apparent inciting event, and bleeding may recur unpredictably.
Figure 34-1.

Thrombus formation at the site of the damaged vascular wall (EC, endothelial cell) and the role of platelets and clotting factors. Platelet membrane receptors include the glycoprotein (GP) Ia receptor, binding to collagen (C); GP Ib receptor binding von Willebrand factor (vWF), and GP IIb/IIIa, which binds fibrinogen and other macromolecules. Antiplatelet prostacyclin ( $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ ) is released from the endothelium. Aggregating substances released from the degranulating platelet include adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}\left(\mathrm{TXA}_{2}\right)$, and serotonin (5-HT). Production of factor Xa is detailed in Figure 34-2. (Redrawn and reproduced, with permission, from Simoons ML, Decker JW: New directions in anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment. [Editorial.] Br Heart J 1995; 74: 337.)

The platelet is central to normal hemostasis and thromboembolic disease, and is the target of many therapies discussed in this chapter. Platelet-rich thrombi (white thrombi) form in the high flow rate and high shear force environment of arteries. Occlusive arterial thrombi cause serious disease by producing downstream ischemia of extremities or vital organs, and can result in limb amputation or organ failure. Venous clots tend to be more fibrin-rich, contain large numbers of trapped red blood cells, and are recognized pathologically as red thrombi. Venous thrombi can cause severe swelling and pain of the affected extremity, but the most feared consequence is pulmonary embolism. This occurs when part or all of the clot breaks off from its location in the deep venous system and travels as an embolus through the right side of the heart and into the pulmonary arterial circulation. Sudden occlusion of a large pulmonary artery can cause acute right heart failure and sudden death. In addition lung ischemia or infarction will occur distal to the occluded pulmonary arterial segment. Such emboli usually arise from the deep venous system of the proximal lower extremities or pelvis. Although all thrombi are mixed, the platelet nidus dominates the arterial thrombus and the fibrin tail dominates the venous thrombus.

\section*{Blood Coagulation Cascade}

Blood coagulates by the transformation of soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin. Several circulating proteins interact in a cascading series of limited proteolytic reactions (Figure 34-2). At each step, a clotting factor zymogen undergoes limited proteolysis and becomes an active protease (eg, factor VII is converted to factor VIIa). Each protease factor activates the next clotting factor in the sequence, culminating in the formation of thrombin (factor IIa). Several of these factors are targets for drug therapy (Table 34-1).
Figure 34-2.

A model of blood coagulation. With tissue factor (TF), factor VII forms an activated complex (VIIa-TF) that catalyzes the activation of factor IX to factor IXa. Activated factor XIa also catalyzes this reaction. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) inhibits the catalytic action of the VIIa-TF complex. The cascade proceeds as shown, resulting ultimately in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, an essential component of a functional clot. The two major anticoagulant drugs, heparin and warfarin (an oral anticoagulant), have very different actions. Heparin, acting in the blood, directly activates anticlotting factors, specifically antithrombin, which inactivates the factors enclosed in rectangles. Warfarin, acting in the liver, inhibits the synthesis of the factors enclosed in circles. Proteins C and S exert anticlotting effects by inactivating activated factors Va and VIIIa.

Thrombin has a central role in hemostasis and has many functions. In clotting, thrombin proteolytically cleaves small peptides from fibrinogen, allowing fibrinogen to polymerize and form a fibrin clot. Thrombin also activates many upstream clotting factors, leading to more thrombin generation, and activates factor XIII, a transaminase that cross-links the fibrin polymer and stabilizes the clot. Thrombin is a potent platelet activator and mitogen. Thrombin also exerts anti coagulant effects by activating the protein C pathway, which attenuates the clotting response (Figure 34-2). It should therefore be apparent that the response to vascular injury is a complex and precisely modulated process that ensures that under normal circumstances, repair of vascular injury occurs without thrombosis and downstream ischemia; that is, the response is proportionate and reversible. Eventually vascular remodeling and repair occur with reversion to the quiescent resting anticoagulant endothelial cell phenotype.

\section*{Initiation of Clotting: The Tissue Factor-VIIa Complex}

The main initiator of blood coagulation in vivo is the tissue factor (TF)-factor VIIa pathway (Figure 34-2). Tissue factor is a transmembrane protein ubiquitously expressed outside the vasculature, but not normally expressed in an active form within vessels. The exposure of TF on damaged endothelium or to blood that has extravasated into tissue binds TF to factor VIIa. This complex, in turn, activates factors X and IX. Factor Xa along with factor Va forms the prothrombinase complex on activated cell surfaces, which catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor IIa). Thrombin, in turn, activates upstream clotting factors, primarily factors V, VIII, and XI, resulting in amplification of thrombin generation. The TF-factor VIIa-catalyzed activation of factor Xa is regulated by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). Thus after initial activation of factor X to Xa by TF-VIIa, further propagation of the clot is by feedback amplification of thrombin through the intrinsic pathway factors VIII and IX (this provides an explanation of why patients with deficiency of factor VIII or IX-hemophilia A and hemophilia B, respectively—have a severe bleeding disorder).

It is also important to note that the coagulation mechanism in vivo does not occur in solution, but is localized to activated cell surfaces expressing anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine, and is mediated by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ bridging between the anionic phospholipids and $\gamma$-carboxyglutamic acid residues of the clotting factors. This is the basis for using calcium chelators such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid
(EDTA) or citrate to prevent blood from clotting in a test tube.
Antithrombin (AT) is an endogenous anticoagulant and a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family; it inactivates the serine proteases IIa, IXa, Xa, XIa, and XIIa. The endogenous anticoagulants protein $\mathbf{C}$ and protein $\mathbf{S}$ attenuate the blood clotting cascade by proteolysis of the two cofactors Va and VIIIa. From an evolutionary standpoint, it is of interest that factors V and VIII have an identical overall domain structure and considerable homology, consistent with a common ancestor gene; likewise the serine proteases are descendents of a trypsin-like common ancestor. Thus, the TF-VIIa initiating complex, serine proteases, and cofactors each have their own lineage-specific attenuation mechanism (see Figure 34-2). Defects in natural anticoagulants result in an increased risk of venous thrombosis. The most common defect in the natural anticoagulant system is a mutation in factor V (factor V Leiden), which results in resistance to inactivation by the protein C , protein S mechanism.

\section*{Fibrinolysis}

Fibrinolysis refers to the process of fibrin digestion by the fibrin-specific protease, plasmin. The fibrinolytic system is similar to the coagulation system in that the precursor form of the serine protease plasmin circulates in an inactive form as plasminogen. In response to injury, endothelial cells synthesize and release tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), which converts plasminogen to plasmin (Figure 34-3). Plasmin remodels the thrombus and limits its extension by proteolytic digestion of fibrin.
Figure 34-3.

Both plasminogen and plasmin have specialized protein domains (kringles) that bind to exposed lysines on the fibrin clot and impart clot specificity to the fibrinolytic process. It should be noted that this clot specificity is only observed at physiologic levels of t -PA. At the pharmacologic levels of t -PA used in thrombolytic therapy, clot specificity is lost and a systemic lytic state is created, with attendant increase in bleeding risk. As in the coagulation cascade, there are negative regulators of fibrinolysis: endothelial cells synthesize and release plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), which inhibits t-PA; in addition $\alpha_{2}$ antiplasmin circulates in the blood at high concentrations and under physiologic conditions will rapidly inactivate any plasmin that is not clot-bound. However, this regulatory system is overwhelmed by therapeutic doses of plasminogen activators.

If the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems are pathologically activated, the hemostatic system may careen out of control, leading to generalized intravascular clotting and bleeding. This process is called disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and may follow massive tissue injury, advanced cancers, obstetric emergencies such as abruptio placentae or retained products of conception, or bacterial sepsis. The treatment of DIC is to control the underlying disease process; if this is not possible, DIC is often fatal.

Regulation of the fibrinolytic system is useful in therapeutics. Increased fibrinolysis is effective therapy for thrombotic disease. Tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase, and streptokinase all activate the fibrinolytic system (Figure 34-3). Conversely, decreased fibrinolysis protects clots from lysis and reduces the bleeding of hemostatic failure. Aminocaproic acid is a clinically useful inhibitor of fibrinolysis. Heparin and the oral anticoagulant drugs do not affect the fibrinolytic mechanism.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF THE ANTI COAGULANT DRUGS}

The ideal anticoagulant drug would prevent pathologic thrombosis and limit reperfusion injury, yet allow a normal response to vascular injury and limit bleeding. Theoretically this could be accomplished by preservation of the TF-VIIa initiation phase of the clotting mechanism with attenuation of the secondary intrinsic pathway propagation phase of clot development. At this time such a drug does not exist; all anticoagulants and fibrinolytic drugs have an increased bleeding risk as their principle toxicity.

\section*{Indirect Thrombin Inhibitors}

The indirect thrombin inhibitors are so-named because their antithrombotic effect is exerted by their interaction with a separate protein, antithrombin. Unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecularweight heparin (LMWH), and the synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux bind to antithrombin and enhance its inactivation of factor Xa. Unfractionated heparin and to a lesser extent LMWH also enhance antithrombin's inactivation of thrombin.

\section*{HEPARIN}

\section*{Chemistry \& Mechanism of Action}

Heparin is a heterogeneous mixture of sulfated mucopolysaccharides. It binds to endothelial cell surfaces and a variety of plasma proteins. Its biologic activity is dependent upon the endogenous anticoagulant antithrombin. Antithrombin inhibits clotting factor proteases, especially thrombin (IIa), IXa, and Xa, by forming equimolar stable complexes with them. In the absence of heparin, these reactions are slow; in the
presence of heparin, they are accelerated 1000-fold. Only about a third of the molecules in commercial heparin preparations have an accelerating effect because the remainder lack the unique pentasaccharide sequence needed for high-affinity binding to antithrombin (Figure 34-4). The active heparin molecules bind tightly to antithrombin and cause a conformational change in this inhibitor. The conformational change of antithrombin exposes its active site for more rapid interaction with the proteases (the activated clotting factors). Heparin functions as a cofactor for the antithrombin-protease reaction without being consumed. Once the antithrombin-protease complex is formed, heparin is released intact for renewed binding to more antithrombin.
Figure 34-4.

Subunit structure of heparin. The small polymer section shown illustrates the repeating disaccharide units typical of heparin. The sequence shows the critical pentasaccharide portion required for binding to antithrombin. In addition to those shown, other saccharides occur. Heparin is a strongly acidic molecule because of its high content of anionic sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. (GlcN, glucosamine; IdUA, iduronic acid; GlcUA, glucuronic acid. The same five residues with the terminal groups shown in parentheses, constitute fondaparinux.)

The antithrombin binding region of commercial unfractionated heparin consists of repeating sulfated disaccharide units composed of D-glucosamine- L-iduronic acid and D-glucosamine- D-glucuronic acid (Figure 34-4). High-molecular-weight fractions of heparin with high affinity for antithrombin markedly inhibit blood coagulation by inhibiting all three factors, especially thrombin and factor Xa. Unfractionated heparin has a molecular weight range of 5000-30,000. In contrast, the shorter-chain low-molecular-weight (LMW) fractions of heparin inhibit activated factor $X$ but have less effect on thrombin than the HMW species. Nevertheless, numerous studies have demonstrated that LMW heparins such as enoxaparin, dalteparin, and tinzaparin are effective in several thromboembolic conditions. In fact, these LMW heparins-in comparison with UFH-have equal efficacy, increased bioavailability from the subcutaneous site of injection, and less frequent dosing requirements (once or twice daily is sufficient).

Because commercial heparin consists of a family of molecules of different molecular weights, the correlation between the concentration of a given heparin preparation and its effect on coagulation often is poor. Therefore, UFH is standardized by bioassay. Heparin sodium USP must contain at least 120 USP units per milligram. Heparin is generally used as the sodium salt, but calcium heparin is equally effective. Lithium heparin is used in vitro as an anticoagulant for blood samples. Commercial heparin is extracted from porcine intestinal mucosa and bovine lung. Enoxaparin is obtained from the same sources as regular heparin, but doses are specified in milligrams. Dalteparin, tinzaparin and danaparoid (an LMW heparanoid containing heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate), on the other hand, are specified in anti-factor Xa units.

\section*{Monitoring of Heparin Effect}

Close monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is necessary in patients receiving UFH. Levels of UFH may also be determined by protamine titration (therapeutic levels $0.2-0.4 \mathrm{unit} / \mathrm{mL}$ ) or anti-Xa units (therapeutic levels $0.3-0.7 \mathrm{unit} / \mathrm{mL}$ ). Weight-based dosing of the LMW heparins results in predictable pharmacokinetics and plasma levels in patients with normal renal function. Therefore, LMW heparin levels are not generally measured except in the setting of renal insufficiency, obesity, and pregnancy. LMW heparin levels can be determined by anti-Xa units. Peak therapeutic levels should be $0.5-1$ unit $/ \mathrm{mL}$ for twice-daily dosing, determined 4 hours after administration, and approximately 1.5 units/mL for once-daily dosing.

\section*{Toxicity}

\section*{BLEEDI NG}

The major adverse effect of heparin is bleeding. This risk can be decreased by scrupulous patient selection, careful control of dosage, and close monitoring. Elderly women and patients with renal failure are more prone to hemorrhage. Heparin is of animal origin and should be used cautiously in patients with allergy. Increased loss of hair and reversible alopecia have been reported. Long-term heparin therapy is associated with osteoporosis and spontaneous fractures. Heparin accelerates the clearing of postprandial lipemia by causing the release of lipoprotein lipase from tissues, and long-term use is associated with mineralocorticoid deficiency.

\section*{HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA}

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a systemic hypercoagulable state that occurs in $1-4 \%$ of individuals treated with UFH for a minimum of 7 days. Surgical patients are at greatest risk. The reported incidence of HIT is lower in pediatric populations outside the critical care setting and is relatively rare in pregnant women. The risk of HIT may be higher in individuals treated with UFH of bovine origin compared with porcine heparin and is lower in those treated exclusively with LMWH.

Morbidity and mortality in HIT are related to thrombotic events. Venous thrombosis occurs most commonly, but occlusion of peripheral or central arteries is not infrequent. If an indwelling catheter is present, the risk of thrombosis is increased in that extremity. Skin necrosis has been described, particularly in individuals treated with warfarin in the absence of a direct thrombin inhibitor, presumably due to acute depletion of the vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant protein C occurring in the presence of high levels of procoagulant proteins and an active hypercoagulable state.

The following points should be considered in all patients receiving heparin: Platelet counts should be performed frequently; thrombocytopenia appearing in a time frame consistent with an immune response to heparin should be considered suspicious for HIT; and any new thrombus occuring in a patient receiving heparin therapy should raise suspicion of HIT. Patients who develop HIT are treated by discontinuance of heparin and administration of a direct thrombin inhibitor or fondaparinux (see below).

\section*{Contraindications}

Heparin is contraindicated in patients with HIT, hypersensitivity to the drug, active bleeding, hemophilia, significant thrombocytopenia, purpura, severe hypertension, intracranial hemorrhage, infective endocarditis, active tuberculosis, ulcerative lesions of the gastrointestinal tract, threatened abortion, visceral carcinoma, or advanced hepatic or renal disease. Heparin should be avoided in patients who have
recently had surgery of the brain, spinal cord, or eye, and in patients who are undergoing lumbar puncture or regional anesthetic block. Despite the apparent lack of placental transfer, heparin should be used in pregnant women only when clearly indicated.

\section*{Administration \& Dosage}

The indications for the use of heparin are described in the section on clinical pharmacology. A plasma concentration of heparin of $0.2-0.4 \mathrm{unit} / \mathrm{mL}$ (by protamine titration) or $0.3-0.7 \mathrm{unit} / \mathrm{mL}$ (anti-Xa units) usually prevents pulmonary emboli in patients with established venous thrombosis. This concentration of heparin will prolong the aPTT to 2-2.5 times that of the control value. This degree of anticoagulant effect should be maintained throughout the course of continuous intravenous heparin therapy. When intermittent heparin administration is used, the aPTT should be measured 6 hours after the administered dose to maintain prolongation of the aPTT to 2-2.5 times that of the control value.

Continuous intravenous administration of heparin is accomplished via an infusion pump. After an initial bolus injection of $80-100$ units $/ \mathrm{kg}$, a continuous infusion of about $15-22$ units $/ \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h}$ is required to maintain the aPTT at 2-2.5 times control. Patients with acute pulmonary emboli often require larger doses during the first few days because of binding to a variety of acute phase proteins, such as factor VIII and von Willebrand factor, and increased heparin clearance. Low-dose prophylaxis is achieved with subcutaneous administration of heparin, 5000 units every 8-12 hours. Because of the danger of hematoma formation at the injection site, heparin must never be administered intramuscularly.

Prophylactic enoxaparin is given subcutaneously in a dosage of 30 mg twice daily or 40 mg once daily. Fulldose enoxaparin therapy is $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ subcutaneously every 12 hours. This corresponds to a therapeutic antifactor Xa level of 0.5-1 unit/mL. Selected patients may be treated with enoxaparin $1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ once a day, with a target anti-Xa level of 1.5 units $/ \mathrm{mL}$. The prophylactic dose of dalteparin is 5000 units subcutaneously once a day; therapeutic dosing is 200 units/kg once a day for venous disease or 120 units/kg every 12 hours for acute coronary syndrome. Low-molecular-weight heparins should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency or body weight greater than 150 kg . Measurement of the anti-Xa level is useful to guide dosing in these individuals.

The synthetic pentasaccharide molecule fondaparinux (Figure 34-4) avidly binds antithrombin with high specific activity, resulting in efficient inactivation of factor Xa. Fondaparinux has a long half-life of 15 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing by subcutaneous administration. Fondaparinux is effective in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism, and appears to not cross-react with pathologic HIT antibodies in most individuals. The use of fondaparinux as an alternative anticoagulant in HIT is currently being tested in clinical trials. Pharmaceutical companies have put much effort into developing an orally bioavailable antiXa inhibitor. The first of these have recently completed phase I clinical trials with promising results and are currently being evaluated for efficacy in prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism.

\section*{Reversal of Heparin Action}

Excessive anticoagulant action of heparin is treated by discontinuance of the drug. If bleeding occurs, administration of a specific antagonist such as protamine sulfate is indicated. Protamine is a highly basic peptide that combines with heparin as an ion pair to form a stable complex devoid of anticoagulant activity. For every 100 units of heparin remaining in the patient, 1 mg of protamine sulfate is given intravenously; the rate of infusion should not exceed 50 mg in any 10-minute period. Excess protamine must be avoided; it also has an anticoagulant effect. Neutralization of LMW heparin by protamine is incomplete. Limited
experience suggests that 1 mg of protamine sulfate may be used to partially neutralize 1 mg of enoxaparin. Protamine will not reverse the activity of fondaparinux. Excess danaparoid can be removed by plasmapheresis.

\section*{Direct Thrombin I nhibitors}

The direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) exert their anticoagulant effect by directly binding to the active site of thrombin, thereby inhibiting thrombin's downstream effects. This is in contrast to indirect thrombin inhibitors such as heparin and LMWH (see above), which act through antithrombin. Hirudin and bivalirudin are bivalent DTIs in that they bind at both the catalytic or active site of thrombin as well as at a substrate recognition site. Argatroban and melagatran are small molecules that bind only at the thrombin active site.

Leeches have been used for bloodletting since the age of Hippocrates. More recently, surgeons have used medicinal leeches (Hirudo medicinalis) to prevent thrombosis in the fine vessels of reattached digits. Hirudin is a specific, irreversible thrombin inhibitor from leech saliva that is now available in recombinant form as lepirudin. Its action is independent of antithrombin, which means it can reach and inactivate fibrin-bound thrombin in thrombi. Lepirudin has little effect on platelets or the bleeding time. Like heparin, it must be administered parenterally and is monitored by the aPTT. Lepirudin is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with thrombosis related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Lepirudin is excreted by the kidney and should be used with great caution in patients with renal insufficiency as no antidote exists. Up to $40 \%$ of patients who receive long-term infusions develop an antibody directed against the thrombin-lepirudin complex. These antigen-antibody complexes are not cleared by the kidney and may result in an enhanced anticoagulant effect. Some patients re-exposed to the drug have developed life-threatening anaphylactic reactions.

Bivalirudin, another bivalent inhibitor of thrombin, is administered intravenously, with a rapid onset and offset of action. The drug has a short half-life with clearance that is $20 \%$ renal and the remainder metabolic. Bivalirudin also inhibits platelet activation and has been FDA-approved for use in percutaneous coronary angioplasty.

Argatroban is a small molecule thrombin inhibitor that is FDA-approved for use in patients with HIT with or without thrombosis and coronary angioplasty in patients with HIT. It, too, has a short half-life, is given by continuous intravenous infusion, and is monitored by aPTT. Its clearance is not affected by renal disease but is dependent on liver function; dose reduction is required in patients with liver disease. Patients on argatroban will demonstrate elevated international normalized ratios (INRs), rendering the transition to warfarin difficult (ie, the INR will reflect contributions from both warfarin and argatroban). (INR is discussed in detail in the discussion of warfarin administration.) A nomogram is supplied by the manufacturer to assist in this transition. No properly designed head-to-head trials have been performed to determine whether argatroban or lepirudin is superior in the treatment of HIT. However in practice, the choice of which DTI to use in a patient with HIT is usually dictated by the condition of the clearing organ. If the patient has severe renal insufficiency, then argatroban would be preferred. If there is severe hepatic insufficiency, then lepirudin would be a better choice.

Ximelagatran is an oral prodrug that is metabolized to the DTI melagatran. Potential advantages of ximelagatran include predictable pharmacokinetics and bioavailability. This allows for fixed dosing and predictable anticoagulant response; no need for routine coagulation monitoring; lack of interaction with

P450-interacting drugs; and rapid onset and offset of action, which allow for immediate anticoagulation and thus no need for overlap with additional anticoagulant drugs. While clinical trials found that ximelagatran was as effective as other anticoagulants in venous thromboembolism and atrial fibrillation, hepatic toxicity was observed in $5-10 \%$ of individuals treated for more than one month. Thus while there is much enthusiasm for a nontoxic oral anticoagulant that might replace warfarin and not require routine monitoring, no such drug is currently FDA-approved.

\section*{Warfarin \& the Coumarin Anticoagulants}

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

The clinical use of the coumarin anticoagulants began with the discovery of an anticoagulant substance formed in spoiled sweet clover silage which caused hemorrhagic disease in cattle. At the behest of local farmers, a chemist at the University of Wisconsin identified the toxic agent as bishydroxycoumarin. A synthesized derivative, dicumarol and its congeners, most notably warfarin ( $\mathbf{W}$ isconsin A lumni R esearch F oundation, with "arin" from coumarin added; Figure 34-5), were initially used as rodenticides. In the 1950s warfarin (under the brand name Coumadin) was introduced as an antithrombotic agent in humans. Warfarin is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs, used by approximately 1.5 million individuals, and several studies have indicated that the drug is significantly underused in clinical situations where it has proven benefit.

Structural formulas of several oral anticoagulant drugs and of vitamin K. The carbon atom of warfarin shown at the asterisk is an asymmetric center.

Warfarin is generally administered as the sodium salt and has 100\% bioavailability. Over 99\% of racemic warfarin is bound to plasma albumin, which may contribute to its small volume of distribution (the albumin
space), its long half-life in plasma ( 36 hours), and the lack of urinary excretion of unchanged drug. Warfarin used clinically is a racemic mixture composed of equal amounts of two enantiomorphs. The levorotatory S -warfarin is four times more potent than the dextrorotatory R -warfarin. This observation is useful in understanding the stereoselective nature of several drug interactions involving warfarin.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Coumarin anticoagulants block the $\gamma$-carboxylation of several glutamate residues in prothrombin and factors VII, IX, and X as well as the endogenous anticoagulant proteins C and S (See Figure 34-2, Table 34-1). The blockade results in incomplete coagulation factor molecules that are biologically inactive. The protein carboxylation reaction is coupled to the oxidation of vitamin K . The vitamin must then be reduced to reactivate it. Warfarin prevents reductive metabolism of the inactive vitamin K epoxide back to its active hydroquinone form (Figure 34-6). Mutational change of the responsible enzyme, vitamin K epoxide reductase, can give rise to genetic resistance to warfarin in humans and especially in rats.
Figure 34-6.

Vitamin K cycle-metabolic interconversions of vitamin K associated with the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Vitamin $\mathrm{K}_{1}$ or $\mathrm{K}_{2}$ is activated by reduction to the hydroquinone form ( $\mathrm{KH}_{2}$ ). Stepwise oxidation to vitamin K epoxide (KO) is coupled to prothrombin carboxylation by the enzyme carboxylase. The reactivation of vitamin K epoxide is the warfarin-sensitive step (warfarin). The R on the vitamin K molecule represents a 20-carbon phytyl side chain in vitamin $\mathrm{K}_{1}$ and a 30- to 65-carbon polyprenyl side chain in vitamin $\mathrm{K}_{2}$.

There is an 8- to 12-hour delay in the action of warfarin. Its anticoagulant effect results from a balance between partially inhibited synthesis and unaltered degradation of the four vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. The resulting inhibition of coagulation is dependent on their degradation half-lives in the circulation.

These half-lives are 6, 24, 40, and 60 hours for factors VII, IX, X, and II, respectively. Larger initial doses of warfarin-up to about $0.75 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$-hasten the onset of the anticoagulant effect. Beyond this dosage, the speed of onset is independent of the dose size. The only effect of a larger loading dose is to prolong the time that the plasma concentration of drug remains above that required for suppression of clotting factor synthesis. The only difference among oral anticoagulants in producing and maintaining hypoprothrombinemia is the half-life of each drug.

\section*{Toxicity}

Warfarin crosses the placenta readily and can cause a hemorrhagic disorder in the fetus. Furthermore, fetal proteins with $\gamma$-carboxyglutamate residues found in bone and blood may be affected by warfarin; the drug can cause a serious birth defect characterized by abnormal bone formation. Thus, warfarin should never be administered during pregnancy. Cutaneous necrosis with reduced activity of protein C sometimes occurs during the first weeks of therapy. Rarely, the same process causes frank infarction of the breast, fatty tissues, intestine, and extremities. The pathologic lesion associated with the hemorrhagic infarction is venous thrombosis, suggesting that it is caused by warfarin-induced depression of protein C synthesis.

\section*{Administration \& Dosage}

Treatment with warfarin should be initiated with standard doses of $5-10 \mathrm{mg}$ rather than the large loading doses formerly used. The initial adjustment of the prothrombin time takes about 1 week, which usually results in a maintenance dose of $5-7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. The prothrombin time (PT) should be increased to a level representing a reduction of prothrombin activity to $25 \%$ of normal and maintained there for long-term therapy. When the activity is less than $20 \%$, the warfarin dosage should be reduced or omitted until the activity rises above $20 \%$.

The therapeutic range for oral anticoagulant therapy is defined in terms of an international normalized ratio (INR). The INR is the prothrombin time ratio (patient prothrombin time/mean of normal prothrombin time for lab) ${ }^{\text {ISI }}$, where the ISI exponent refers to the International Sensitivity Index, and is dependent on the specific reagents and instruments used for the determination. The ISI serves to relate measured prothrombin times to a World Health Organization reference standard thromboplastin; thus the prothrombin times performed on different properly calibrated instruments with a variety of thromboplastin reagents should give the same INR results for a given sample. For most reagent and instrument combinations in current use, the ISI is close to 1 , making the INR roughly the ratio of the patient prothrombin time to the mean normal prothrombin time. The recommended INR for prophylaxis and treatment of thrombotic disease is 2-3. Patients with some types of artificial heart valves (eg, tilting disk) or other medical conditions increasing thrombotic risk have a recommended range of 2.5-3.5.

Occasionally patients exhibit warfarin resistance, defined as progression or recurrence of a thrombotic event while in therapeutic range. These individuals may have their INR target raised (which is accompanied by an increase in bleeding risk) or be changed to an alternative form of anticoagulation (eg, daily injections of LMWH). Warfarin resistance is most commonly seen in patients with advanced cancers, typically of gastrointestinal origin (Trousseau's syndrome). A recent study has demonstrated the superiority of LMWH over warfarin in preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer.

\section*{Drug Interactions}

The oral anticoagulants often interact with other drugs and with disease states. These interactions can be broadly divided into pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects (Table 34-2). Pharmacokinetic
mechanisms for drug interaction with oral anticoagulants are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for interactions with warfarin are synergism (impaired hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis, as in hepatic disease), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and an altered physiologic control loop for vitamin K (hereditary resistance to oral anticoagulants).

${ }^{1}$ Stereoselectively inhibits the oxidative metabolism of the ( S )-warfarin enantiomorph of racemic warfarin.
The most serious interactions with warfarin are those that increase the anticoagulant effect and the risk of bleeding. The most dangerous of these interactions are the pharmacokinetic interactions with the pyrazolones phenylbutazone and sulfinpyrazone. These drugs not only augment the hypoprothrombinemia but also inhibit platelet function and may induce peptic ulcer disease (see Chapter 36). The mechanisms for their hypoprothrombinemic interaction are a stereoselective inhibition of oxidative metabolic transformation of S -warfarin (the more potent isomer) and displacement of albumin-bound warfarin, increasing the free fraction. For this and other reasons, neither phenylbutazone nor sulfinpyrazone is in common use in the USA. Metronidazole, fluconazole, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole also stereoselectively inhibit the metabolic transformation of S -warfarin, whereas amiodarone, disulfiram, and cimetidine inhibit metabolism of both enantiomorphs of warfarin. Aspirin, hepatic disease, and hyperthyroidism augment warfarin pharmacodynamically-aspirin by its effect on platelet function and the latter two by increasing the turnover rate of clotting factors. The third-generation cephalosporins eliminate the bacteria in the intestinal tract that produce vitamin K and, like warfarin, also directly inhibit vitamin K epoxide reductase.

Barbiturates and rifampin cause a marked decrease of the anticoagulant effect by induction of the hepatic enzymes that transform racemic warfarin. Cholestyramine binds warfarin in the intestine and reduces its absorption and bioavailability.

Pharmacodynamic reductions of anticoagulant effect occur with vitamin K (increased synthesis of clotting factors), the diuretics chlorthalidone and spironolactone (clotting factor concentration), hereditary resistance (mutation of vitamin K reactivation cycle molecules), and hypothyroidism (decreased turnover rate of clotting factors).

Drugs with no significant effect on anticoagulant therapy include ethanol, phenothiazines, benzodiazepines,
acetaminophen, opioids, indomethacin, and most antibiotics.

\section*{Reversal of Warfarin Action}

Excessive anticoagulant effect and bleeding from warfarin can be reversed by stopping the drug and administering oral or parenteral vitamin $K_{1}$ (phytonadione), fresh-frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates such as Bebulin and Proplex T, and recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa). The disappearance of excessive effect is not correlated with plasma warfarin concentrations but rather with reestablishment of normal activity of the clotting factors. A modest excess of anticoagulant effect without bleeding may require no more than cessation of the drug. The warfarin effect can be rapidly reversed in the setting of severe bleeding with the administration of prothrombin complex or rFVIIa coupled with intravenous vitamin K . It is important to note that due to the long half life of warfarin, a single dose of vitamin K or rFVIIa may not be sufficient.

\section*{BASIC PHARMACOLOGY OF THE FIBRI NOLYTI C DRUGS}

Fibrinolytic drugs rapidly lyse thrombi by catalyzing the formation of the serine protease plasmin from its precursor zymogen, plasminogen (Figure 34-3). These drugs create a generalized lytic state when administered intravenously. Thus, both protective hemostatic thrombi and target thromboemboli are broken down. Thrombolytic Drugs for Acute Myocardial Infarction describes the use of these drugs in one major application.

\section*{THROMBOLYTIC DRUGS FOR ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION}

The paradigm shift in 1980 on the causation of acute myocardial infarction to acute coronary occlusion by a thrombus created the rationale for thrombolytic therapy of this common lethal disease. At that time-and for the first time-intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction in the European Cooperative Study Group trial was found to reduce mortality significantly. Later studies, with thousands of patients in each trial, provided enough statistical power for the $20 \%$ reduction in mortality to be considered statistically significant. Although the standard of care in areas with adequate facilities and experience in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) now favors catheterization and placement of a stent, thrombolytic therapy is still very important where PCl is not readily available.

The proper selection of patients for thrombolytic therapy is critical. The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction is made clinically and is confirmed by electrocardiography. Patients with ST-segment elevation and bundle branch block on electrocardiography have the best outcomes. All trials to date show the greatest benefit for thrombolytic therapy when it is given early, within 6 hours after symptomatic onset of acute myocardial infarction.

Thrombolytic drugs reduce the mortality of acute myocardial infarction. The early and appropriate use of any thrombolytic drug probably transcends possible advantages of a particular drug. Adjunctive drugs such as aspirin, heparin, Bblockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce mortality even further. The principles of management are outlined in part 7 of the American Heart Association Guidelines, 2000.

Streptokinase is a protein (but not an enzyme in itself) synthesized by streptococci that combines with the proactivator plasminogen. This enzymatic complex catalyzes the conversion of inactive plasminogen to active plasmin. Urokinase is a human enzyme synthesized by the kidney that directly converts plasminogen to active plasmin. Plasmin itself cannot be used because naturally occurring inhibitors in plasma prevent its effects. However, the absence of inhibitors for urokinase and the streptokinaseproactivator complex permit their use clinically. Plasmin formed inside a thrombus by these activators is protected from plasma antiplasmins, which allows it to lyse the thrombus from within.

Anistreplase (anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex; APSAC) consists of a complex of purified human plasminogen and bacterial streptokinase that has been acylated to protect the enzyme's active site. When administered, the acyl group spontaneously hydrolyzes, freeing the activated streptokinase-proactivator complex. This product (recently discontinued in the USA) allows for rapid intravenous injection, greater clot selectivity (ie, more activity on plasminogen associated with clots than on free plasminogen in the blood), and more thrombolytic activity.

Plasminogen can also be activated endogenously by tissue plasminogen activators (t-PAs). These activators preferentially activate plasminogen that is bound to fibrin, which (in theory) confines fibrinolysis to the formed thrombus and avoids systemic activation. Human $t$-PA is manufactured as alteplase by means of recombinant DNA technology.

Reteplase is another recombinant human $t$-PA from which several amino acid sequences have been deleted. Reteplase is less expensive to produce than t-PA. Because it lacks the major fibrin-binding domain, reteplase is less fibrin-specific than t - PA. Tenecteplase is a mutant form of t- PA that has a longer half-life, and it can be given as an intravenous bolus. Tenecteplase is slightly more fibrin-specific than t -PA.

\section*{Indications \& Dosage}

Administration of fibrinolytic drugs by the intravenous route is indicated in cases of pulmonary embolism with hemodynamic instability, severe deep venous thrombosis such as the superior vena caval syndrome, and ascending thrombophlebitis of the iliofemoral vein with severe lower extremity edema. These drugs are also given intra-arterially, especially for peripheral vascular disease.

Thrombolytic therapy in the management of acute myocardial infarction requires careful patient selection, the use of a specific thrombolytic agent, and the benefit of adjuvant therapy. Streptokinase is administered by intravenous infusion of a loading dose of 250,000 units, followed by 100,000 units $/ \mathrm{h}$ for 24-72 hours. Patients with antistreptococcal antibodies can develop fever, allergic reactions, and therapeutic resistance. Urokinase requires a loading dose of 300,000 units given over 10 minutes and a maintenance dose of 300,000 units $/ \mathrm{h}$ for 12 hours. Alteplase ( t - PA) is given by intravenous infusion of 60 mg over the first hour and then 40 mg at a rate of $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{h}$. Reteplase is given as two intravenous bolus injections of 10 units each, separated by 30 minutes. Tenecteplase is given as a single intravenous bolus of $0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$. Anistreplase (where available) is given as a single intravenous injection of 30 units over 3-5 minutes. A single course of fibrinolytic drugs is expensive: hundreds of dollars for streptokinase and thousands for urokinase and t - PA.

Recombinant t-PA has also been approved for use in acute ischmic stroke within 3 hours of symptom onset. In patients without hemorrhagic infarct or other contraindications, this therapy has been demonstrated to provide better outcomes in several randomized clinical trials. The recommended dose is $0.9 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, not to exceed 90 mg , with $10 \%$ given as a bolus and the remainder during a 1 hour infusion. Streptokinase has
been associated with increased bleeding risk in acute ischemic stroke when given at a dose of 1.5 million units, and its use is not recommended in this setting.

\section*{BASIC PHARMACOLOGY OF ANTI PLATELET AGENTS}

Platelet function is regulated by three categories of substances. The first group consists of agents generated outside the platelet that interact with platelet membrane receptors, eg, catecholamines, collagen, thrombin, and prostacyclin. The second category contains agents generated within the platelet that interact with membrane receptors, eg, ADP , prostaglandin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$, prostaglandin $\mathrm{E}_{2}$, and serotonin. The third group comprises agents generated within the platelet that act within the platelet, eg, prostaglandin endoperoxides and thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$, the cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP, and calcium ion. From this list of agents, several targets for platelet inhibitory drugs have been identified (see Figure 34-1): inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (aspirin), inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation (clopidogrel, ticlopidine), and blockade of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors on platelets (abciximab, tirofiban, and eptifibatide). Dipyridamole and cilostazol are additional antiplatelet drugs.

\section*{ASPIRIN}

The prostaglandin thromboxane $\mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{2}}$ is an arachidonate product that causes platelets to change shape, release their granules, and aggregate (see Chapter 18). Drugs that antagonize this pathway interfere with platelet aggregation in vitro and prolong the bleeding time in vivo. Aspirin is the prototype of this class of drugs.

As described in Chapter 18, aspirin inhibits the synthesis of thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ by irreversible acetylation of the enzyme cyclooxygenase. Other salicylates and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also inhibit cyclooxygenase but have a shorter duration of inhibitory action because they cannot acetylate cyclooxygenase; that is, their action is reversible.

The FDA has approved the use of $325 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ for primary prophylaxis of myocardial infarction but urges caution in this use of aspirin by the general population except when prescribed as an adjunct to risk factor management by smoking cessation and lowering of blood cholesterol and blood pressure. Meta-analysis of many published trials of aspirin and other antiplatelet agents confirms the value of this intervention in the secondary prevention of vascular events among patients with a history of vascular events.

\section*{CLOPIDOGREL \& TICLOPIDINE}

Clopidogrel and ticlopidine reduce platelet aggregation by inhibiting the ADP pathway of platelets. These drugs are thienopyridine derivatives that achieve their antiplatelet effects by irreversibly blocking the ADP receptor on platelets. Unlike aspirin, these drugs have no effect on prostaglandin metabolism. Randomized clinical trials with both drugs report efficacy in the prevention of vascular events among patients with transient ischemic attacks, completed strokes, and unstable angina pectoris. Use of clopidogrel or ticlopidine to prevent thrombosis is now considered standard practice in patients undergoing placement of a coronary stent.

Adverse effects of ticlopidine include nausea, dyspepsia, and diarrhea in up to 20\% of patients, hemorrhage in $5 \%$, and, most seriously, leukopenia in $1 \%$. The leukopenia is detected by regular monitoring of the white blood cell count during the first 3 months of treatment. Development of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has also been associated with the ingestion of ticlopidine. The dosage of
ticlopidine is $\mathbf{2 5 0 ~ m g}$ twice daily. It is particularly useful in patients who cannot tolerate aspirin. Doses of ticlopidine less than $500 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ may be efficacious with fewer adverse effects.

Clopidogrel has fewer adverse effects than ticlopidine and is rarely associated with neutropenia. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura associated with clopidogrel has been reported. Because of its superior side effect profile and dosing requirements, clopidogrel is preferred over ticlopidine. The antithrombotic effects of clopidogrel are dose-dependent; within 5 hours after an oral loading dose of $300 \mathrm{mg}, 80 \%$ of platelet activity will be inhibited. The maintenance dose of clopidogrel is $75 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, which achieves maximum platelet inhibition. The duration of the antiplatelet effect is $7-10$ days.

\section*{Aspirin \& Clopidogrel Resistance}

The reported incidence of resistance to these drugs varies greatly, from less than $5 \%$ to $75 \%$. In part this tremendous variation in incidence reflects the definition of resistance (recurrent thrombosis while on antiplatelet therapy vs in vitro testing), methods by which drug response is measured, and patient compliance. Several methods for testing aspirin and clopidogrel resistance in vitro are now FDA-approved; however, their utility outside of clinical trials remains controversial.

\section*{BLOCKADE OF PLATELET GLYCOPROTEIN IIB/IIIA RECEPTORS}

The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are used in patients with acute coronary syndromes. These drugs target the platelet IIb/IIIa receptor complex (Figure 34-1). The IIb/IIIa complex functions as a receptor mainly for fibrinogen and vitronectin but also for fibronectin and von Willebrand factor. Activation of this receptor complex is the "final common pathway" for platelet aggregation. There are approximately 50,000 copies of this complex on the surface of each platelet. Persons lacking this receptor have a bleeding disorder called Glanzmann's thrombasthenia.

Abciximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against the IIb/IIIa complex including the vibronectin receptor, was the first agent approved in this class of drugs. It has been approved for use in percutaneous coronary intervention and in acute coronary syndromes. Eptifibatide is an analog of the sequence at the extreme carboxyl terminal of the delta chain of fibrinogen, which mediates the binding of fibrinogen to the receptor. Tirofiban is a smaller molecule with similar properties. Eptifibatide and tirofiban inhibit ligand binding to the IIb/IIIa receptor by their occupancy of the receptor but do not block the vibronectin receptor.

The three agents described above are administered parenterally. Oral formulations of IIb/IIIa antagonists have been developed and are in various stages of development.

\section*{ADDITIONAL ANTI PLATELET-DIRECTED DRUGS}

Dipyridamole is a vasodilator that inhibits platelet function by inhibiting adenosine uptake and cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity. Dipyridamole by itself has little or no beneficial effect. Therefore, therapeutic use of this agent is primarily in combination with aspirin to prevent cerebrovascular ischemia. It may also be used in combination with warfarin for primary prophylaxis of thromboemboli in patients with prosthetic heart valves. A combination of dipyridamole complexed with 25 mg of aspirin is now available for secondary prophylaxis of cerebrovascular disease.

Cilostazol is a newer phosphodiesterase inhibitor that promotes vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Cilostazol is used primarily to treat intermittent claudication.

\section*{Risk Factors}

\section*{I NHERITED DI SORDERS}

The inherited disorders characterized by a tendency to form thrombi (thrombophilia) derive from either quantitative or qualitative abnormalities of the natural anticoagulant system. Deficiencies (loss of function mutations) in the natural anticoagulants antithrombin, protein C , and protein S account for approximately $15 \%$ of selected patients with juvenile or recurrent thrombosis and $5-10 \%$ of unselected cases of acute venous thrombosis. Additional causes of thrombophilia include gain of function mutations such as the factor V Leiden mutation and the prothrombin 20210 mutation, elevated clotting factor and cofactor levels, and hyperhomocysteinemia that together account for the greater number of hypercoagulable patients. Although the loss of function mutations are less common, they are associated with the greatest thrombosis risk.
Some patients have multiple inherited risk factors or combinations of inherited and acquired risk factors as discussed below. These individuals are at higher risk for recurrent thrombotic events and are often considered candidates for lifelong therapy.

\section*{ACQUIRED DISEASE}

The increased risk of thromboembolism associated with atrial fibrillation and with the placement of mechanical heart valves has long been recognized. Similarly, prolonged bed rest, high-risk surgical procedures, and the presence of cancer are clearly associated with an increased incidence of deep venous thrombosis and embolism. Antiphospholipic antibody syndrome is another important acquired risk factor. Drugs may function as synergistic risk factors in concert with inherited risk factors. For example, women who have the factor $\vee$ Leiden mutation and take oral contraceptives have a synergistic increase in risk.

\section*{Antithrombotic Management}

\section*{PREVENTION}

Primary prevention of venous thrombosis reduces the incidence of and mortality rate from pulmonary emboli. Heparin and warfarin may be used to prevent venous thrombosis. Subcutaneous administration of low-dose unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, or fondaparinux provides effective prophylaxis. Warfarin is also effective but requires laboratory monitoring of the prothrombin time.

\section*{TREATMENT OF ESTABLISHED DISEASE}

Treatment for established venous thrombosis is initiated with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin for the first 5-7 days, with an overlap with warfarin. Once therapeutic effects of warfarin have been established, therapy with warfarin is continued for a minimum of 3-6 months. Patients with recurrent disease or identifiable, nonreversible risk factors may be treated indefinitely. Small thrombi confined to the calf veins may be managed without anticoagulants if there is documentation over time that the thrombus is not extending.

Warfarin readily crosses the placenta. It can cause hemorrhage at any time during pregnancy as well as developmental defects when administered during the first trimester. Therefore, venous thromboembolic disease in pregnant women is generally treated with heparin, best administered by subcutaneous injection.

\section*{ARTERIAL THROMBOSIS}

Activation of platelets is considered an essential process for arterial thrombosis. Thus, treatment with platelet-inhibiting drugs such as aspirin and clopidogrel or ticlopidine is indicated in patients with transient ischemic attacks and strokes or unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction. In angina and infarction, these drugs are often used in conjunction with Bblockers, calcium channel blockers, and fibrinolytic drugs.

\section*{DRUGS USED IN BLEEDING DISORDERS}

\section*{VITAMI N K}

Vitamin K confers biologic activity upon prothrombin and factors VII, IX, and X by participating in their postribosomal modification. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble substance found primarily in leafy green vegetables. The dietary requirement is low, because the vitamin is additionally synthesized by bacteria that colonize the human intestine. Two natural forms exist: vitamins $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$. Vitamin $K_{1}$ (phytonadione; Figure 34-5) is found in food. Vitamin $K_{2}$ (menaquinone) is found in human tissues and is synthesized by intestinal bacteria.

Vitamins $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ require bile salts for absorption from the intestinal tract. Vitamin $K_{1}$ is available clinically in oral and parenteral forms. Onset of effect is delayed for 6 hours but the effect is complete by 24 hours when treating depression of prothrombin activity by excess warfarin or vitamin K deficiency. Intravenous administration of vitamin $K_{1}$ should be slow, because rapid infusion can produce dyspnea, chest and back pain, and even death. Vitamin K repletion is best achieved with intravenous or oral administration, because its bioavailability after subcutaneous administration is erratic. Vitamin $K_{1}$ is currently administered to all newborns to prevent the hemorrhagic disease of vitamin K deficiency, which is especially common in premature infants. The water-soluble salt of vitamin $K_{3}$ (menadione) should never be used in therapeutics. It is particularly ineffective in the treatment of warfarin overdosage. Vitamin K deficiency frequently occurs in hospitalized patients in intensive care units because of poor diet, parenteral nutrition, recent surgery, multiple antibiotic therapy, and uremia. Severe hepatic failure results in diminished protein synthesis and a hemorrhagic diathesis that is unresponsive to vitamin K.

\section*{PLASMA FRACTIONS}

\section*{Sources \& Preparations}

Deficiencies in plasma coagulation factors can cause bleeding (Table 34-3). Spontaneous bleeding occurs when factor activity is less than $5-10 \%$ of normal. Factor VIII deficiency (classic hemophilia, or hemophilia A) and factor IX deficiency (Christmas disease, or hemophilia B) account for most of the heritable coagulation defects. Concentrated plasma fractions are available for the treatment of these deficiencies. Administration of plasma-derived, heat- or detergent-treated factor concentrates and recombinant factor concentrates are the standard treatments for bleeding associated with hemophilia. Lyophilized factor VIII concentrates are prepared from large pools of plasma. Transmission of viral diseases such as hepatitis B and C and HIV is reduced or eliminated by pasteurization and by extraction of plasma with solvents and detergents. However, this treatment does not remove other potential causes of transmissable diseases such as prions. For this reason, recombinant clotting factor preparations are recommended whenever possible for factor replacement. The best use of these therapeutic materials requires diagnostic specificity of the deficient factor and quantitation of its activity in plasma. Intermediate purity factor VIII concentrates (as opposed to recombinant or high purity concentrates) contain significant amounts of von Willebrand factor. Humate-P is a factor VIII concentrate that is approved by the FDA for the
treatment of bleeding associated with von Willebrand disease.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

An uncomplicated hemorrhage into a joint should be treated with sufficient factor VIII or factor IX replacement to maintain a level of at least 30-50\% of the normal concentration for 24 hours. Soft tissue hematomas require a minimum of $100 \%$ activity for 7 days. Hematuria requires at least $10 \%$ activity for 3 days. Surgery and major trauma require a minimum of $100 \%$ activity for 10 days. The initial loading dose for factor VIII is 50 units/kg of body weight to achieve $100 \%$ activity of factor VIII from a baseline of $s 1 \%$, assuming a normal hemoglobin. Each unit of factor VIII per kilogram of body weight raises its activity in plasma $2 \%$. Replacement should be administered every 12 hours. Factor IX therapy requires twice the dose of factor VIII, but with an administration of about every 24 hours because of its longer half-life. Recombinant factor IX has only $80 \%$ recovery compared with plasma-derived factor IX products. Therefore, dosing with recombinant factor IX requires $120 \%$ of the dose used with the plasma-derived product.

Desmopressin acetate increases the factor VIII activity of patients with mild hemophilia A or von Willebrand disease. It can be used in preparation for minor surgery such as tooth extraction without any requirement for infusion of clotting factors if the patient has a documented adequate response. High-dose intranasal desmopressin (see Chapter 17) is available and has been shown to be efficacious and well tolerated by patients.

Freeze-dried concentrates of plasma containing prothrombin, factors IX and X, and varied amounts of factor VII (Proplex, etc) are commercially available for treating deficiencies of these factors (Table 34-3). Each unit of factor IX per kilogram of body weight raises its activity in plasma $1.5 \%$. Heparin is often added
to inhibit coagulation factors activated by the manufacturing process. However, addition of heparin does not eliminate all thromboembolic risk.

Some preparations of factor IX concentrate contain activated clotting factors, which has led to their use in treating patients with inhibitors or antibodies to factor VIII or factor IX. Two products are available expressly for this purpose: Autoplex (with factor VIII correctional activity) and FEIBA (F actor E ight I nhibitor B ypassing A ctivity). These products are not uniformly successful in arresting hemorrhage, and the factor IX inhibitor titers often rise after treatment with them. Acquired inhibitors of coagulation factors may also be treated with porcine factor VIII (for factor VIII inhibitors) and recombinant activated factor VII. Recombinant activated factor VII (NovoSeven) is being increasingly used to treat coagulopathy associated with liver disease and major blood loss in trauma and surgery. These recombinant and plasma-derived factor concentrates are very expensive, and the indications for them are very precise. Therefore, close consultation with a hematologist knowledgeable in this area is essential.

Cryoprecipitate is a plasma protein fraction obtainable from whole blood. It is used to treat deficiencies or qualitative abnormalities of fibrinogen, such as that which occurs with disseminated intravascular coagulation and liver disease. A single unit of cryoprecipitate contains 300 mg of fibrinogen.

Cryoprecipitate may also be used for patients with factor VIII deficiency and von Willebrand disease if desmopressin is not indicated and a pathogen-inactivated, recombinant, or plasma-derived product is not available. The concentration of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor in cryoprecipitate is not as great as that found in the concentrated plasma fractions. Moreover, cryoprecipitate is not treated in any manner to decrease the risk of viral exposure. For infusion, the frozen cryoprecipitate unit is thawed and dissolved in a small volume of sterile citrate-saline solution and pooled with other units. Rh-negative women with potential for childbearing should receive only Rh-negative cryoprecipitate because of possible contamination of the product with Rh-positive blood cells.

\section*{FIBRI NOLYTI C I NHI BITORS: AMI NOCAPROI C ACID}

Aminocaproic acid (EACA), which is chemically similar to the amino acid lysine, is a synthetic inhibitor of fibrinolysis. It competitively inhibits plasminogen activation (Figure 34-3). It is rapidly absorbed orally and is cleared from the body by the kidney. The usual oral dosage of EACA is 6 g four times a day. When the drug is administered intravenously, a 5 g loading dose should be infused over 30 minutes to avoid hypotension. Tranexamic acid is an analog of aminocaproic acid and has the same properties. It is administered orally with a $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ loading dose followed by $30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ every 6 hours, but the drug is not currently available in the USA.

Clinical uses of aminocaproic acid are as adjunctive therapy in hemophilia, as therapy for bleeding from fibrinolytic therapy, and as prophylaxis for rebleeding from intracranial aneurysms. Treatment success has also been reported in patients with postsurgical gastrointestinal bleeding and postprostatectomy bleeding and bladder hemorrhage secondary to radiation- and drug-induced cystitis. Adverse effects of the drug include intravascular thrombosis from inhibition of plasminogen activator, hypotension, myopathy, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and nasal stuffiness. The drug should not be used in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation or genitourinary bleeding of the upper tract, eg, kidney and ureters, because of the potential for excessive clotting.

\section*{SERI NE PROTEASE INHIBITORS: APROTI NI N}

Aprotinin is a serine protease inhibitor ("serpin") that inhibits fibrinolysis by free plasmin and may have other antihemorrhagic effects as well. It also inhibits the plasmin-streptokinase complex in patients who have received that thrombolytic agent. Aprotinin will reduce bleeding-by as much as 50\%-from many types of surgery, especially that involving extracorporeal circulation for open heart procedures and liver transplantation. It is currently approved for use in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting who are at high risk of excessive blood loss. In earlier placebo-controlled trials, adverse effects of aprotinin were little different from those reported in patients in the placebo group. A more recent study indicated an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and renal damage in aprotinin-treated patients. In larger studies, a possible association with anaphylaxis has been reported in < 0.5\% of cases. Therefore, a small test dose is recommended before the full therapeutic dose is given.

The two major clinical sequelae of hyperlipidemias are acute pancreatitis and atherosclerosis. The former occurs in patients with marked hyperlipemia. Control of triglycerides can prevent recurrent attacks of this life-threatening disease.

Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death for both genders in the USA and other Western countries. Lipoproteins that contain apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 convey lipids into the artery wall. These are lowdensity (LDL), intermediate-density (IDL), very-low-density (VLDL), and lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]).

Cellular components in atherosclerotic plaques include foam cells, which are transformed macrophages and smooth muscle cells filled with cholesteryl esters. These cellular alterations result from endocytosis of modified lipoproteins via at least four species of scavenger receptors. Chemical modification of lipoproteins by free radicals creates ligands for these receptors. The atheroma grows with the accumulation of foam cells, collagen, fibrin, and frequently calcium. Whereas such lesions can slowly occlude coronary vessels, clinical symptoms are more frequently precipitated by rupture of unstable atheromatous plaques, leading to activation of platelets and formation of occlusive thrombi.

Although treatment of hyperlipidemia can cause slow physical regression of plaques, the well-documented reduction in acute coronary events that follows vigorous lipid-lowering treatment is attributable chiefly to mitigation of the inflammatory activity of macrophages and is evident within 2-3 months after starting therapy.

High-density lipoproteins (HDL) exert several anti atherogenic effects. They participate in retrieval of cholesterol from the artery wall and inhibit the oxidation of atherogenic lipoproteins. Low levels of HDL (hypoalphalipoproteinemia) are an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic disease and thus are a target for intervention.

Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for coronary disease. It is associated with reduced levels of HDL, impairment of cholesterol retrieval, cytotoxic effects on the endothelium, increased oxidation of lipoproteins, and stimulation of thrombogenesis. Diabetes, also a major risk factor, is another source of oxidative stress.

Normal coronary arteries can dilate in response to ischemia, increasing delivery of oxygen to the myocardium. This process is mediated by nitric oxide, acting upon smooth muscle cells of the arterial media. This function is impaired by atherogenic lipoproteins, thus aggravating ischemia. Reducing levels of atherogenic lipoproteins and inhibiting their oxidation restores endothelial function.

Because atherogenesis is multifactorial, therapy should be directed toward all modifiable risk factors. Atherogenesis is a dynamic process. Quantitative angiographic trials have demonstrated net regression of plaques during aggressive lipid-lowering therapy. Primary and secondary prevention trials have shown significant reduction in mortality from new coronary events and in all-cause mortality.

\section*{PATHOPHYSI OLOGY OF HYPERLI POPROTEI NEMI A NORMAL LI POPROTEI N METABOLI SM}

\section*{Structure}

Lipoproteins have hydrophobic core regions containing cholesteryl esters and triglycerides surrounded by unesterified cholesterol, phospholipids, and apoproteins. Certain lipoproteins contain very high-molecularweight B proteins that exist in two forms: $\mathbf{B - 4 8}$, formed in the intestine and found in chylomicrons and their remnants; and B-100, synthesized in liver and found in VLDL, VLDL remnants (IDL), LDL (formed from VLDL), and Lp(a) lipoproteins.

\section*{Synthesis \& Catabolism}

\section*{CHYLOMI CRONS}

Chylomicrons are formed in the intestine and carry triglycerides of dietary origin, unesterified cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters. They transit the thoracic duct to the bloodstream.

Triglycerides are removed in extrahepatic tissues through a pathway shared with VLDL that involves hydrolysis by the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) system. Decrease in particle diameter occurs as triglycerides are depleted. Surface lipids and small apoproteins are transferred to HDL. The resultant chylomicron remnants are taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis into hepatocytes.

\section*{VERY-LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS}

VLDL are secreted by liver and export triglycerides to peripheral tissues (Figure 35-1). VLDL triglycerides are hydrolyzed by LPL, yielding free fatty acids for storage in adipose tissue and for oxidation in tissues such as cardiac and skeletal muscle. Depletion of triglycerides produces remnants (IDL), some of which undergo endocytosis directly by liver. The remainder is converted to LDL by further removal of triglycerides mediated by hepatic lipase. This process explains the "beta shift" phenomenon, the increase of LDL (beta-lipoprotein) in serum as hypertriglyceridemia subsides. Increased levels of LDL can also result from increased secretion
of VLDL and from decreased LDL catabolism.

Metabolism of lipoproteins of hepatic origin. The heavy arrows show the primary pathways. Nascent VLDL are secreted via the Golgi apparatus. They acquire additional C lipoproteins and apo E from HDL. VLDL are converted to VLDL remnants (IDL) by lipolysis via lipoprotein lipase in the vessels of peripheral tissues. In the process, C apolipoproteins and a portion of the apo E are given back to HDL. Some of the VLDL remnants are converted to LDL by further loss of triglycerides and loss of apo E. A major pathway for LDL degradation involves the endocytosis of LDL by LDL receptors in the liver and the peripheral tissues, for which apo B-100 is the ligand.

\section*{LOW-DENSITY LI POPROTEI NS}

LDL is catabolized chiefly in hepatocytes and other cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Cholesteryl esters from LDL are hydrolyzed, yielding free cholesterol for the synthesis of cell membranes. Cells also obtain cholesterol by synthesis via a pathway involving the formation of mevalonic acid by HMG-CoA reductase. Production of this enzyme and of LDL receptors is transcriptionally regulated by the content of cholesterol in the cell. Normally, about 70\% of LDL is removed from plasma by hepatocytes. Even more cholesterol is delivered to the liver via IDL and chylomicrons. Unlike other cells, hepatocytes can eliminate cholesterol by secretion in bile and by conversion to bile acids.

\section*{LP(A) LI POPROTEI N}

Lp(a) lipoprotein is formed from LDL and the (a) protein, linked by a disulfide bridge. The (a) protein is highly homologous with plasminogen but is not activated by tissue plasminogen activator. It occurs in a number of isoforms of different molecular weights. Levels of Lp(a) vary from nil to over $500 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ and are determined chiefly by genetic factors. Lp(a) can be found in atherosclerotic plaques and may also contribute to coronary disease by inhibiting thrombolysis. Levels are elevated in nephrosis.

\section*{HIGH-DENSITY LI POPROTEI NS}

The apoproteins of HDL are secreted by the liver and intestine. Much of the lipid comes from the surface monolayers of chylomicrons and VLDL during lipolysis. HDL also acquires cholesterol from peripheral tissues, protecting the cholesterol homeostasis of cells. Free cholesterol is transported from the cell membrane by a transporter, ABCA1, acquired by a small particle termed prebeta-1 HDL, and then esterified by lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), leading to the formation of larger HDL species. Cholesterol is also exported from macrophages by the ABCG1 transporter to large HDL particles. The cholesteryl esters are transferred to VLDL, IDL, LDL, and chylomicron remnants with the aid of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). Much of the cholesteryl ester thus transferred is ultimately delivered to the liver by endocytosis of the acceptor lipoproteins. HDL can also deliver cholesteryl esters directly to the liver via a docking receptor (scavenger receptor, SR-BI) that does not cause endocytosis of the lipoproteins.

\section*{LI POPROTEI N DISORDERS}

Lipoprotein disorders are detected by measuring lipids in serum after a 10-hour fast. Risk of heart disease increases with concentrations of the atherogenic lipoproteins, is inversely related to levels of HDL, and is modified by other risk factors (Table 35-1). Evidence from clinical trials suggests that LDL cholesterol levels of $60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ may be optimal for patients with coronary disease. Ideally, triglycerides should be below 120 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Differentiation of the disorders requires identification of the lipoproteins involved (Table 35-2). Diagnosis of a primary disorder usually requires further clinical and genetic data as well as ruling out secondary hyperlipidemias (Table 35-3).
