\section*{ADRENOCEPTOR-ACTI VATI NG \& OTHER SYMPATHOMI METI C DRUGS: I NTRODUCTION}

The sympathetic nervous system is an important regulator of the activities of organs such as the heart and peripheral vasculature, especially in responses to stress (see Chapter 6). The ultimate effects of sympathetic stimulation are mediated by release from nerve terminals of norepinephrine that serves to activate the adrenoceptors on postsynaptic sites. Also, in response to a variety of stimuli such as stress, the adrenal medulla releases epinephrine, which is transported in the blood to target tissues; in other words, epinephrine acts as a hormone. Drugs that mimic the actions of epinephrine or norepinephrine-sympathomimetic drugs -would be expected to have a wide range of effects. An understanding of the pharmacology of these agents is thus a logical extension of what we know about the physiologic role of the catecholamines.

\section*{The Mode \& Spectrum of Action of Sympathomimetic Drugs}

Like the cholinomimetic drugs, the sympathomimetics can be grouped by mode of action and by the spectrum of receptors that they activate. Some of these drugs (eg, norepinephrine and epinephrine) act by a direct mode; that is, they directly interact with and activate adrenoceptors. Others act indirectly ; their actions are dependent on the release of endogenous catecholamines. These indirect agents may have either of two different mechanisms: (1) displacement of stored catecholamines from the adrenergic nerve ending (eg, amphetamine and tyramine) or (2) inhibition of reuptake of catecholamines already released (eg, cocaine and tricyclic antidepressants). Some drugs have both direct and indirect actions. Both types of sympathomimetics, direct and indirect, ultimately cause activation of adrenoceptors, leading to some or all of the characteristic effects of endogenous catecholamines. The selectivity of different sympathomimetics for various types of adrenoceptors is discussed below.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF SYMPATHOMI METI C DRUGS I DENTI FI CATI ON OF ADRENOCEPTORS}

The effort to understand the molecular mechanisms by which catecholamines act has a long and rich history. A great conceptual debt is owed to the work done by John Langley and Paul Ehrlich 100 years ago in developing the hypothesis that drugs have their effects by interacting with specific "receptive" substances. Raymond Ahlquist in 1948 rationalized a large body of observations by his conjecture that catecholamines acted via two principal receptors. He termed these receptors cand B. Alpha receptors are those that have the comparative potencies epinephrine $\geq$ norepinephrine $\gg$ isoproterenol. Beta receptors have the comparative potencies isoproterenol > epinephrine $\equiv$ norepinephrine. Ahlquist's hypothesis was dramatically confirmed by the development of drugs that selectively antagonize Breceptors but not $a$. receptors (see Chapter 10). More recent evidence suggests that areceptors comprise two major families. At present, therefore, it appears appropriate to classify adrenoceptors into three major groups, namely, $\beta, \alpha_{1}$ , and $x_{2}$ receptors. Each of these major groups of receptors also has three subtypes. Considerable effort has been expended in elucidating structure-function relationships that determine ligand binding properties and the molecular signaling characteristics of the various adrenergic receptors.

\section*{BETA ADRENOCEPTORS}

Soon after the demonstration of separate and Breceptors, it was found that there were at least two
subtypes of Breceptors, designated $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$. These subtypes are operationally defined by their affinities for epinephrine and norepinephrine: $B_{1}$ receptors have approximately equal affinity for epinephrine and norepinephrine, whereas $B_{2}$ receptors have a higher affinity for epinephrine than for norepinephrine. Subsequently, $B_{3}$ receptors were identified as a novel and distinct third $B$-adrenoceptor subtype. These receptor types are listed in Table 9-1.

\section*{ALPHA ADRENOCEPTORS}

Following the demonstration of the Bsubtypes, two major groups of areceptors were found: $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$. These receptors were originally identified with antagonist drugs that distinguished between $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$ receptors. For example, cadrenoceptors were identified in a variety of tissues by measuring the binding of radiolabeled antagonist compounds that are considered to have a high affinity for these receptors, eg, dihydroergocryptine ( $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$ ), prazosin ( $\alpha_{1}$ ), and yohimbine ( $\alpha_{2}$ ). These radioligands were used to measure the number of receptors in tissues and to determine the affinity (by displacement of the radiolabeled ligand) of other drugs that interact with the receptors.

The concept of subtypes within the group emerged out of pharmacologic experiments that demonstrated complex shapes of agonist dose-response curves of smooth muscle contraction as well as differences in antagonist affinities in inhibiting contractile responses in various tissues. These experiments demonstrated the existence of two subtypes of 1 receptor that could be distinguished on the basis of their reversible affinities for a variety of drugs and experimental compounds. A third $\alpha_{1}$-receptor subtype was subsequently identified by molecular cloning techniques. These $Q_{1}$ receptors are termed $Q_{1 \mathrm{~A}}$, and $Q_{1 \mathrm{~B}}$ receptors. There is evidence that the $Q_{1 \mathrm{~A}}$ receptor has splice variants. A major current area of investigation is determining the importance of each of these various subtypes in mediating $\alpha_{1}$-receptor responses in a variety of organs.

The hypothesis that there are subtypes of $\alpha_{2}$ receptors emerged from pharmacologic experiments and molecular cloning. It is now known that there are three subtypes of $\alpha_{2}$ receptors, termed $\alpha_{2 A}$, $\alpha_{2 B}$, and $\alpha_{2}$. 2c, which are products of distinct genes.

\section*{DOPAMINE RECEPTORS}

The endogenous catecholamine dopamine produces a variety of biologic effects that are mediated by interactions with specific dopamine receptors (Table 9-1). These receptors are distinct from cand $B$
receptors and are particularly important in the brain (see Chapters 21 and 29) and in the splanchnic and renal vasculature. There is now considerable evidence for the existence of at least five subtypes of dopamine receptors. Pharmacologically distinct dopamine receptor subtypes, termed $\mathrm{D}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{D}_{2}$, have been known for some time. Molecular cloning has identified several distinct genes encoding each of these subtypes. Further complexity occurs because of the presence of introns within the coding region of the $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ like receptor genes, which allows for alternative splicing of the exons in this major subtype. There is extensive polymorphic variation in the $\mathrm{D}_{4}$ human receptor gene. The terminology of the various subtypes is $D_{1}, D_{2}, D_{3}, D_{4}$, and $D_{5}$. They comprise two $D_{1}$-like receptors ( $D_{1}$ and $D_{5}$ ) and three $D_{2}$-like ( $D_{2}, D_{3}$, and $\mathrm{D}_{4}$ ). These subtypes may have importance for understanding the efficacy and adverse effects of novel antipsychotic drugs (see Chapter 29).

\section*{Receptor Selectivity}

Examples of clinically useful sympathomimetic agonists that are relatively selective for $\alpha_{1}-\alpha_{2}-$, and $B$ adrenoceptor subgroups are compared with some nonselective agents in Table 9-2. Selectivity means that a drug may preferentially bind to one subgroup of receptors at concentrations too low to interact extensively with another subgroup. For example, norepinephrine preferentially activates $B_{1}$ receptors compared with $B_{2}$ receptors. However, selectivity is not usually absolute (nearly absolute selectivity has been termed "specificity"), and at higher concentrations related classes of receptor may also interact with the drug. As a result, the "numeric" subclassification of adrenoceptors is clinically important mainly for drugs that have relatively marked selectivity. Given interpatient variations in drug kinetics and dynamics, the extent of a drug's selectivity should be kept in mind if this property is viewed as clinically important in the treatment of an individual patient.

The exact number of adrenoceptor subtypes that are actually expressed in human tissues is uncertain, but expression of subtypes has been demonstrated in tissues in which the physiologic or pharmacologic importance of the subtype is not yet known. These results suggest the possibility of designing novel drugs to exploit the expression of a particular receptor subtype in a single target tissue. For example, determining which blood vessels express which subtypes of $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$ receptors could lead to design of drugs having selectivity for certain vascular beds such as the splanchnic or coronary vessels. Similarly, there has been extensive investigation into the $x_{1}$-receptor subtypes mediating pharmacologic responses in the human prostate (see Receptor Selectivity and Physiologic Functions of Adrenoceptor Subtypes).

\section*{Receptor Selectivity and Physiologic Functions of Adrenoceptor Subtypes: Lessons from Knockout Mice}

Since pharmacologic tools used to evaluate the function of adrenoceptor subtypes have some limitations, a number of knockout mice have been developed with one or more adrenoceptor genes subjected to loss of function mutations, as described in Chapter 1 (see Pharmacology \& Genetics). These models have their
own complexities and extrapolations from mice to humans may be uncertain. Nonetheless, these studies have yielded some novel insights. For example, a-adrenoceptor subtypes play an important role in cardiac responses, the 2 A -adrenoceptor subtype is critical in transducing the effects of $a_{2}$ agonists on blood pressure control, and $B_{1}$ receptors play a predominant role in directly increasing heart rate in mouse heart.

\section*{MOLECULAR MECHANI SMS OF SYMPATHOMI METI C ACTI ON}

The effects of catecholamines are mediated by cell surface receptors. As described in Chapter 2, these GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors) are coupled by G proteins to the various effector proteins whose activities are regulated by those receptors. Each $G$ protein is a heterotrimer consisting of $a$, $B$, and $\gamma$ subunits. G proteins are classified on the basis of their distinctive asubunits. G proteins of particular importance for adrenoceptor function include $\mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{s}}$, the stimulatory G protein of adenylyl cyclase; $\mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{i}}$, the inhibitory G protein of adenylyl cyclase; and $\mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{q}}$, the protein coupling areceptors to phospholipase C. The activation of G protein-coupled receptors by catecholamines promotes the dissociation of GDP from the as subunit of the appropriate G protein. GTP then binds to this G protein, and the asubunit dissociates from the B- $\gamma$ unit. The activated GTP-bound asubunit then regulates the activity of its effector. Effectors of adrenoceptor-activated asubunits include adenylyl cyclase, cGMP phosphodiesterase, phospholipase C, and ion channels. The asubunit is inactivated by hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP and phosphate, and the subsequent reassociation of the asubunit with the $B-\gamma$ subunit. The $B-\gamma$ subunits have additional independent effects, acting on a variety of effectors such as ion channels and enzymes.

\section*{Receptor Types}

\section*{ALPHA RECEPTORS}

Alpha $_{1}$ receptors are coupled to polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis, leading to the formation of inositol 1,4,5trisphosphate (I P3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) (Table 9-1, Figure 9-1). G proteins in the $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{q}}$ family couple ${ }_{1}$ receptors to phospholipase C . IP 3 promotes the release of sequestered $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores, which increases the cytoplasmic concentration of free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and the activation of various calciumdependent protein kinases. Activation of these receptors may also increase influx of calcium across the cell's plasma membrane. IP 3 is sequentially dephosphorylated, which ultimately leads to the formation of free inositol. DAG activates protein kinase C, which modulates activity of many signaling pathways. In addition, $x_{1}$ receptors activate signal transduction pathways that were originally described for peptide growth factor receptors that activate tyrosine kinases. For example, $Q_{1}$ receptors have been found to activate mitogen-activated kinases (MAP kinases) and polyphosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI-3-kinase). These pathways may have importance for the $c_{1}$-receptor-mediated stimulation of cell growth and proliferation through the regulation of gene expression. The physiologic significance of this "cross talk" between major signaling pathways remains to be determined.

Activation of $Q_{1}$ responses. Stimulation of $Q_{1}$ receptors by catecholamines leads to the activation of a $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{q}}$-coupling protein. The activated asubunit ( $\alpha_{\mathrm{q}} *$ ) of this G protein activates the effector, phospholipase C , which leads to the release of IP ${ }_{3}$ (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) and DAG (diacylglycerol) from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns 4,5-P ${ }_{2}$ ). IP ${ }_{3}$ stimulates the release of sequestered stores of calcium, leading to an increased concentration of cytoplasmic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ may then activate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent protein kinases, which in turn phosphorylate their substrates. DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). See text for additional effects of $Q_{1}$-receptor activation.

Alpha ${ }_{2}$ receptors inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity and cause intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels to decrease. In addition to this well-documented effect, $\alpha_{2}$ receptors utilize other signaling pathways, including regulation of ion channel activities and the activities of important enzymes involved in signal transduction. $a_{2}$-receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity is transduced by the inhibitory regulatory protein, $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{i}}$ (Figure 9-2). How the activation of $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{i}}$ leads to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase is unclear, but it is likely that both a and the $B-\gamma$ subunits of $G_{i}$ contribute to this response. In addition, some of the effects of $a_{2}$ adrenoceptors are independent of their ability to inhibit adenylyl cyclase; for example, $\alpha_{2}$-receptor agonists cause platelet aggregation and a decrease in platelet cAMP levels, but it is not clear whether aggregation is the result of the decrease in cAMP or other mechanisms involving $G_{i}$ regulated effectors.

Alphaz -adrenoceptor ligands inhibit adenylyl cyclase by causing dissociation of the inhibitory G protein, $G_{i}$, into its subunits; ie, an activated $Q_{i}$ subunit charged with GTP and a Brunit. The mechanism by which these subunits inhibit adenylyl cyclase is uncertain. CAMP binds to the regulatory subunit (R) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, leading to the liberation of active catalytic subunits (C) that phosphorylate specific protein substrates and modify their activity. These catalytic units also phosphorylate the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which modifies gene expression. See text for other actions of $B$ and $\alpha_{2}$ adrenoceptors.

\section*{BETA RECEPTORS}

The mechanism of action of Bagonists has been studied in considerable detail. Activation of all three receptor subtypes ( $B_{1}, B_{2}$, and $B_{3}$ ) results in activation of adenylyl cyclase and increased conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cAMP (Table 9-1, Figure 9-2). Activation of the cyclase enzyme is mediated by the stimulatory coupling protein $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$. cAMP is the major second messenger of B-receptor activation. For example, in the liver of many species, $B$-receptor activation increases cAMP synthesis, which leads to a cascade of events culminating in the activation of glycogen phosphorylase. In the heart, Breceptor activation increases the influx of calcium across the cell membrane and its sequestration inside the cell. Beta-receptor activation also promotes the relaxation of smooth muscle. Although the mechanism of the smooth muscle effect is uncertain, it may involve the phosphorylation of myosin light-chain kinase to an
inactive form (see Figure 12-1). Beta adrenoceptors may activate voltage-sensitive calcium channels in the heart via $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$-mediated enhancement independently of changes in cAMP concentration. Under certain circumstances, $B_{2}$ receptors may couple to $G_{q}$ proteins. These receptors have been demonstrated to activate additional kinases, such as MAP kinases, by forming multi-subunit complexes within cells, which contain multiple signaling molecules. In addition, recent evidence suggests that formation of dimers of $B$ receptors themselves (both homodimers and heterodimers of $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ receptors) is prominently involved in their signaling mechanisms. Moreover, agonist activation of Breceptors promotes the association of several different proteins with these receptors, leading to activation of novel, additional signal pathways that regulate complex intracellular functions. Similarly, additional proteins interact directly with $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$ receptors, leading to further physiologic responses at a cellular level.

\section*{DOPAMINE RECEPTORS}

The $D_{1}$ receptor is typically associated with the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (Table 9-1); for example, $D_{1}$ -receptor-induced smooth muscle relaxation is presumably due to cAMP accumulation in the smooth muscle of those vascular beds in which dopamine is a vasodilator. $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ receptors have been found to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity, open potassium channels, and decrease calcium influx.

\section*{Receptor Regulation}

Responses mediated by adrenoceptors are not fixed and static. The number and function of adrenoceptors on the cell surface and their responses may be regulated by catecholamines themselves, other hormones and drugs, age, and a number of disease states (see Chapter 2). These changes may modify the magnitude of a tissue's physiologic response to catecholamines and can be important clinically during the course of treatment. One of the best-studied examples of receptor regulation is the desensitization of adrenoceptors that may occur after exposure to catecholamines and other sympathomimetic drugs. After a cell or tissue has been exposed for a period of time to an agonist, that tissue often becomes less responsive to further stimulation by that agent. Other terms such as tolerance, refractoriness, and tachyphylaxis have also been used to denote desensitization. This process has potential clinical significance because it may limit the therapeutic response to sympathomimetic agents.

Many mechanisms have been found to contribute to desensitization. Operating at transcriptional, translational, and protein levels, some mechanisms function relatively slowly-over the course of hours or days. Other mechanisms of desensitization occur quickly, within minutes. Rapid modulation of receptor function in desensitized cells may involve critical covalent modification of the receptor, especially by phosphorylation on specific amino acid residues, association of these receptors with other proteins, or changes in their subcellular location.

There are two major categories of desensitization of responses mediated by G protein-coupled receptors.
Homologous desensitization refers to loss of responsiveness exclusively of the receptors that have been exposed to repeated or sustained activation by a drug. Heterologous desensitization refers to loss of responsiveness of some cell surface receptors that have not been directly activated by the drug in question.

A major mechanism of desensitization that occurs rapidly involves phosphorylation of receptors by members of the $\mathbf{G}$ protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) family, of which there are at least seven members. Specific adrenoceptors are substrates for these kinases only when they are bound to an agonist. This mechanism is an example of homologous desensitization because it specifically involves only agonistoccupied receptors.

Phosphorylation of these receptors enhances their affinity for Barrestins; upon binding of a B-arrestin molecule, the capacity of the receptor to activate $G$ proteins is blunted, presumably due to steric hindrance (see Figure 2-12). Arrestins constitute another large family of widely expressed proteins. Receptor phosphorylation followed by $B$-arrestin binding has been linked to subsequent endocytosis of the receptor. This response may be facilitated by the capacity of Barrestins to bind to the structural protein clathrin. In addition to blunting responses requiring the presence of the receptor on the cell surface, these regulatory processes may also contribute to novel mechanisms of receptor signaling via intracellular pathways.

Receptor desensitization may also be mediated by second-messenger feedback. For example, $B$ adrenoceptors stimulate cAMP accumulation, which leads to activation of protein kinase A; protein kinase A can phosphorylate residues on Breceptors, resulting in inhibition of receptor function. For the $B_{2}$ receptor, phosphorylation occurs on serine residues both in the third cytoplasmic loop and in the carboxyl terminal tail of the receptor. Similarly, activation of protein kinase C by $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{q}}$-coupled receptors may lead to phosphorylation of this class of G protein-coupled receptors. This second-messenger feedback mechanism has been termed heterologous desensitization because activated protein kinase A or protein kinase C may phosphorylate any structurally similar receptor with the appropriate consensus sites for phosphorylation by these enzymes.

\section*{ADRENOCEPTOR POLYMORPHISMS}

Since elucidation of the sequences of the genes encoding the $\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}$, and Bsubtypes of adrenoceptors, it has become clear that there are relatively common genetic polymorphisms for many of these receptor subtypes in humans. Some of these may lead to changes in critical amino acid sequences that have pharmacologic importance. There is evidence that some of these polymorphisms may change the susceptibility to diseases such as heart failure, alter the propensity of a receptor to desensitize, and alter therapeutic responses to drugs in diseases such as asthma.

\section*{CHEMI STRY \& PHARMACOKI NETI CS OF SYMPATHOMI METIC DRUGS}

Phenylethylamine may be considered the parent compound from which sympathomimetic drugs are derived (Figure 9-3). This compound consists of a benzene ring with an ethylamine side chain. Substitutions may be made (1) on the terminal amino group, (2) on the benzene ring, and (3) on the aror Bcarbons. Substitution by -OH groups at the 3 and 4 positions yields sympathomimetic drugs collectively known as catecholamines. The effects of modification of phenylethylamine are to change the affinity of the drugs for $a$. and Breceptors as well as to influence the intrinsic ability to activate the receptors. In addition, chemical structure determines the pharmacokinetic properties of these molecules. Sympathomimetic drugs may activate both and Breceptors; however, the relative a.receptor versus B-receptor activity spans the range from almost pure activity (methoxamine) to almost pure Bactivity (isoproterenol).

Phenylethylamine and some important catecholamines. Catechol is shown for reference.

\section*{SUBSTITUTION ON THE AMI NO GROUP}

Increasing the size of alkyl substituents on the amino group tends to increase $B$-receptor activity. For example, methyl substitution on norepinephrine, yielding epinephrine, enhances activity at $B_{2}$ receptors. Beta activity is further enhanced with isopropyl substitution at the amino nitrogen (isoproterenol). Betaz selective agonists generally require a large amino substituent group. The larger the substituent on the amino group, the lower the activity at areceptors; for example, isoproterenol is very weak at areceptors.

\section*{SUBSTITUTION ON THE BENZENE RING}

Maximal cand Bactivity is found with catecholamines (drugs having - OH groups at the 3 and 4 positions). The absence of one or the other of these groups, particularly the hydroxyl at $\mathrm{C}_{3}$, without other substitutions on the ring may dramatically reduce the potency of the drugs. For example, phenylephrine (Figure 9-4) is much less potent than epinephrine; indeed, a-receptor affinity is decreased about 100-fold and Bactivity is almost negligible except at very high concentrations. However, catecholamines are subject to inactivation by catechol-O- methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme found in gut and liver (see Chapter 6). Therefore, absence of one or both - OH groups on the phenyl ring increases the bioavailability after oral administration and prolongs the duration of action. Furthermore, absence of ring - OH groups tends to increase the distribution of the molecule to the central nervous system. For example, ephedrine and amphetamine (Figure 9-4) are orally active, have a prolonged duration of action, and produce central nervous system effects not typically observed with the catecholamines.

\section*{SUBSTITUTION ON THE ALPHA CARBON}

Substitutions at the acarbon block oxidation by monoamine oxidase (MAO) and prolong the action of such drugs, particularly the noncatecholamines. Ephedrine and amphetamine are examples of as a compounds (Figure 9-4). Alpha-methyl compounds are also called phenylisopropylamines. In addition to their resistance to oxidation by MAO, some phenylisopropylamines have an enhanced ability to displace catecholamines from storage sites in noradrenergic nerves (see Chapter 6). Therefore, a portion of their activity is dependent on the presence of normal norepinephrine stores in the body; they are indirectly acting sympathomimetics.

\section*{SUBSTITUTION ON THE BETA CARBON}

Direct-acting agonists typically have a B-hydroxyl group, though dopamine does not. In addition to facilitating activation of adrenoceptors, this hydroxyl group may be important for storage of sympathomimetic amines in neural vesicles.

\section*{ORGAN SYSTEM EFFECTS OF SYMPATHOMI METI C DRUGS}

General outlines of the cellular actions of sympathomimetics are presented in Tables 6-3 and 9-3. The net effect of a given drug in the intact organism depends on its relative receptor affinity (a. or B), intrinsic activity, and the compensatory reflexes evoked by its direct actions.

\section*{Cardiovascular System}

\section*{BLOOD VESSELS}

Vascular smooth muscle tone is regulated by adrenoceptors; consequently, catecholamines are important in controlling peripheral vascular resistance and venous capacitance. Alpha receptors increase arterial resistance, whereas $B_{2}$ receptors promote smooth muscle relaxation. There are major differences in receptor types in the various vascular beds (Table 9-4). The skin vessels have predominantly areceptors and constrict in response to epinephrine and norepinephrine, as do the splanchnic vessels. Vessels in skeletal muscle may constrict or dilate depending on whether breceptors are activated. Consequently,
the overall effects of a sympathomimetic drug on blood vessels depend on the relative activities of that drug at and Breceptors and the anatomic sites of the vessels affected. In addition, $\mathrm{D}_{1}$ receptors promote vasodilation of renal, splanchnic, coronary, cerebral, and perhaps other resistance vessels. Activation of the $D_{1}$ receptors in the renal vasculature may play a major role in the natriuresis induced by pharmacologic administration of dopamine.
