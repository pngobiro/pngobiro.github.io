Phenotypes of abnormal lipoprotein distribution are described in this section. Drugs mentioned for use in these conditions are described in the following section on basic and clinical pharmacology.

\section*{THE PRI MARY HYPERTRI GLYCERI DEMI AS}

Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with increased risk of coronary disease. VLDL and IDL have been found in atherosclerotic plaques. These patients tend to have cholesterol-rich VLDL of small particle diameter.

Hypertriglyceridemic patients with coronary disease or risk equivalents should be treated aggressively. Patients with triglycerides above $700 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ should be treated to prevent acute pancreatitis because the LPL clearance mechanism is saturated at about this level.

\section*{Primary Chylomicronemia}

Chylomicrons are not present in the serum of normal individuals who have fasted 10 hours. The recessive traits of deficiency of lipoprotein lipase or its cofactor are usually associated with severe lipemia (2000-2500 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ of triglycerides when the patient is consuming a typical American diet). These disorders might not be diagnosed until an attack of acute pancreatitis occurs. Patients may have eruptive xanthomas, hepatosplenomegaly, hypersplenism, and lipid-laden foam cells in bone marrow, liver, and spleen. The lipemia is aggravated by estrogens because they stimulate VLDL production, and pregnancy may cause marked increases in triglycerides despite strict dietary control. Although these patients have a predominant chylomicronemia, they may also have moderately elevated VLDL, presenting with a pattern called mixed lipemia (fasting chylomicronemia and elevated VLDL). LPL deficiency is diagnosed by assay of lipolytic activity after intravenous injection of heparin. A presumptive diagnosis is made by demonstrating a pronounced decrease in triglycerides a few days after reduction of daily fat intake below 15 g . Marked restriction of total dietary fat is the basis of effective long-term treatment. Niacin or a fibrate may be of some benefit if VLDL levels are increased.

\section*{Familial Hypertriglyceridemia}

\section*{SEVERE (USUALLY MI XED LI PEMI A)}

Mixed lipemia usually results from impaired removal of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Factors that increase VLDL production aggravate the lipemia because VLDL and chylomicrons are competing substrates for LPL. The primary mixed lipemias probably reflect a variety of genetic determinants. Most patients have centripetal obesity with insulin resistance. Other factors that increase secretion of VLDL also worsen the lipemia. Eruptive xanthomas, lipemia retinalis, epigastric pain, and pancreatitis are variably present depending on the severity of the lipemia. Treatment is primarily dietary, with restriction of total fat, avoidance of alcohol and exogenous estrogens, weight reduction, and exercise. Most patients also require treatment with a fibrate or niacin.

\section*{MODERATE}

Primary increases of VLDL also reflect a genetic predisposition and are worsened by factors that increase the rate of VLDL secretion from liver, ie, obesity, alcohol, diabetes, and estrogens. Treatment includes addressing these issues and the use of fibrates or niacin as needed. Marine omega-3 fatty acids are a valuable adjuvant.

\section*{Familial Combined Hyperlipoproteinemia}

In this common disorder associated with an increased incidence of coronary disease, individuals may have elevated levels of VLDL, LDL, or both, and the pattern may change with time. Familial combined hyperlipoproteinemia involves an approximate doubling in VLDL secretion and appears to be transmitted as a semidominant trait. Triglycerides can be increased by the factors noted above. Elevations of cholesterol and triglycerides are generally moderate, and xanthomas are usually absent. Diet alone does not normalize lipid levels. A reductase inhibitor alone, or in combination with niacin or fenofibrate, is usually required to treat these patients. When fenofibrate is combined with a reductase inhibitor, pravastatin or rosuvastatin are recommended because they are not metabolized via CYP3A4.

\section*{Familial Dysbetalipoproteinemia}

In this disorder, remnants of chylomicrons and VLDL accumulate and levels of LDL are decreased. Because remnants are rich in cholesteryl esters, the level of cholesterol may be as high as that of triglycerides. Diagnosis is confirmed by the absence of the E3 and E4 isoforms of apo E or the E2/E2 genotype. Patients often develop tuberous or tuberoeruptive xanthomas, or characteristic planar xanthomas of the palmar creases. They tend to be obese, and some have impaired glucose tolerance. These factors, as well as hypothyroidism, can aggravate the lipemia. Coronary and peripheral atherosclerosis occur with increased frequency. Weight loss, together with decreased fat, cholesterol, and alcohol consumption, may be sufficient, but a fibrate or niacin is usually needed to control the condition. These agents can be given together in more resistant cases, or a reductase inhibitor may be added.

\section*{THE PRI MARY HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMI AS}

\section*{Familial Hypercholesterolemia}

Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant trait. Although levels of LDL tend to increase throughout childhood, the diagnosis can often be made on the basis of elevated umbilical cord blood cholesterol. In most heterozygotes, cholesterol levels range from 260 to $500 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Triglycerides are usually normal, tendon xanthomas are often present, and arcus corneae and xanthelasma may appear in the third decade. Coronary disease tends to occur prematurely. In homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, which can lead to coronary disease in childhood, levels of cholesterol often exceed $1000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ and early tuberous and tendinous xanthomas occur. These patients may also develop elevated plaque-like xanthomas of the aortic valve, digital webs, buttocks, and extremities.

Defects of LDL receptors underlie familial hypercholesterolemia. Some individuals have combined heterozygosity for alleles producing nonfunctional and kinetically impaired receptors. In heterozygous patients, LDL can be normalized with combined drug regimens (Figure 35-2). Homozygotes and those with combined heterozygosity whose receptors retain even minimal function may partially respond to niacin, ezetimibe, or reductase inhibitors.
Figure 35-2.

\section*{Familial Ligand-Defective Apolipoprotein B}

Defects in the domain of apo B-100 that binds to the LDL receptor impair the endocytosis of LDL, leading to hypercholesterolemia of moderate severity. Tendon xanthomas may occur. These disorders are as prevalent as familial hypercholesterolemia. Response to reductase inhibitors is variable. Up-regulation of LDL receptors in liver increases endocytosis of LDL precursors but does not increase uptake of ligand-defective LDL particles. Niacin often has beneficial effects by reducing VLDL production.

\section*{Familial Combined Hyperlipoproteinemia}

As described above, some persons with this disorder have only an elevation in LDL. Serum cholesterol is usually less than $350 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Dietary and drug treatment, usually with a reductase inhibitor, is indicated. It may be necessary to add niacin or fenofibrate to normalize LDL or to reduce triglycerides.

\section*{Lp(a) Hyperlipoproteinemia}

This familial disorder, which is associated with increased atherogenesis, is determined chiefly by alleles that dictate increased production of the (a) protein moiety. Niacin reduces levels of Lp(a) in many patients.

\section*{Other Disorders}

Deficiency of cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase can increase LDL in the heterozygous state. Homozygotes can also have elevated triglycerides, resistance to reductase inhibitors, and increased risk of gallstones. Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia is due to mutations in a protein that normally assists in endocytosis of LDL. Mutations in the PCSK9 gene also cause isolated elevations of LDL. Niacin, ezetimibe, and reductase inhibitors may be useful, variably, in these disorders.

\section*{HDL Deficiency}

Rare genetic disorders, including Tangier disease and LCAT deficiency, are associated with extremely low levels of HDL. Familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia is a more common disorder with levels of HDL cholesterol usually below $35 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in men and $45 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in women. These patients tend to have premature atherosclerosis, and the low HDL may be the only identified risk factor. Management should include special attention to avoidance or treatment of other risk factors. Niacin increases HDL in many of these patients. Reductase inhibitors and fibric acid derivatives exert lesser effects.

In the presence of hypertriglyceridemia, HDL cholesterol is low because of exchange of cholesteryl esters from HDL into triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Treatment of the hypertriglyceridemia may increase or normalize the HDL level.

\section*{SECONDARY HYPERLI POPROTEI NEMI A}

Before primary disorders can be diagnosed, secondary causes of the phenotype must be considered. The more common conditions are summarized in Table 35-3. The lipoprotein abnormality usually resolves if the underlying disorder can be treated successfully.

\section*{DI ETARY MANAGEMENT OF HYPERLI POPROTEI NEMI A}

Dietary measures are initiated first-unless the patient has evident coronary or peripheral vascular disease-and may obviate the need for drugs. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or familial combined hyperlipidemia will always require drug therapy. Cholesterol and saturated and trans fats are the principal factors that increase LDL, whereas total fat, alcohol, and excess calories increase triglycerides.

Sucrose and other simple sugars raise VLDL in hypertriglyceridemic patients. Alcohol can cause significant hypertriglyceridemia by increasing hepatic secretion of VLDL. Synthesis and secretion of VLDL are increased by excess calories. During weight loss, LDL and VLDL levels may be much lower than can be maintained during neutral caloric balance. The conclusion that diet suffices for management can only be made after weight has stabilized for at least 1 month.

General recommendations include limiting total calories from fat to 20-25\% of daily intake, saturated fats to less than $8 \%$; and cholesterol to less than $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. Reductions in serum cholesterol range from $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ on this regimen. Use of complex carbohydrates and fiber is recommended, and cis -monounsaturated fats should predominate. Weight reduction, caloric restriction, and avoidance of alcohol are especially important for patients with elevated VLDL and IDL.

The effect of dietary fats on hypertriglyceridemia is dependent upon the disposition of double bonds in the fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oils, but not those from plant sources, can induce profound reduction of triglycerides in some patients with endogenous or mixed lipemia. In contrast, the omega-6
fatty acids present in vegetable oils may cause triglycerides to increase.
Patients with primary chylomicronemia and some with mixed lipemia must consume a diet severely restricted in total fat ( $10-15 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$, of which 5 g should be vegetable oils rich in essential fatty acids), and fatsoluble vitamins should be given.

Homocysteine, which initiates proatherogenic changes in endothelium, can be reduced in many patients by restriction of total protein intake to the amount required for amino acid replacement. Supplementation with up to 2 mg of folic acid plus other B vitamins is also recommended.

\section*{BASIC \& CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF DRUGS USED IN HYPERLI PIDEMIA}

The decision to use drug therapy is based on the specific metabolic defect and its potential for causing atherosclerosis or pancreatitis. Suggested regimens for the principal lipoprotein disorders are presented in Table 35-2. Diet should be continued to achieve the full potential of the drug regimen. Drugs should be avoided in pregnant and lactating women and those likely to become pregnant. All drugs that alter plasma lipoprotein concentrations may require adjustment of doses of warfarin and indandione anticoagulants. Children with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia may be treated with a resin or reductase inhibitor, usually after 7 or 8 years of age, when myelination of the central nervous system is essentially complete. The decision to treat a child should be based on the level of LDL, other risk factors, the family history, and the child's age. Drugs are rarely indicated before age 16.

\section*{COMPETITIVE INHIBITORS OF HMG-COA REDUCTASE (REDUCTASE I NHI BITORS; "STATI NS")}

These compounds are structural analogs of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A, Figure 35-3). Lovastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin belong to this class. They are most effective in reducing LDL. Other effects include decreased oxidative stress and vascular inflammation with increased stability of atherosclerotic lesions. It has become standard practice to initiate reductase inhibitor therapy immediately after acute coronary syndromes, irrespective of lipid levels.

Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Top: The HMG-CoA intermediate that is the immediate precursor of mevalonate, a critical compound in the synthesis of cholesterol. Bottom: The structure of lovastatin and its active form, showing the similarity to the normal HMG-CoA intermediate (shaded areas).

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Lovastatin and simvastatin are inactive lactone prodrugs that are hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract to the active B-hydroxyl derivatives, whereas pravastatin has an open, active lactone ring. Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin are fluorine-containing congeners that are active as given. Absorption of the ingested doses of the reductase inhibitors varies from $40 \%$ to $75 \%$ with the exception of fluvastatin, which is almost completely absorbed. All have high first-pass extraction by the liver. Most of the absorbed dose is excreted in the bile; $5-20 \%$ is excreted in the urine. Plasma half-lives of these drugs range from 1 hour to 3 hours except for atorvastatin, which has a half-life of 14 hours, and rosuvastatin, 19 hours.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

HMG-CoA reductase mediates the first committed step in sterol biosynthesis. The active forms of the reductase inhibitors are structural analogs of the HMG-CoA intermediate (Figure 35-3) that is formed by HMG-CoA reductase in the synthesis of mevalonate. These analogs cause partial inhibition of the enzyme and thus may impair the synthesis of isoprenoids such as ubiquinone and dolichol and the prenylation of proteins. It is not known whether this has biologic significance. However, the reductase inhibitors clearly
induce an increase in high-affinity LDL receptors. This effect increases both the fractional catabolic rate of LDL and the liver's extraction of LDL precursors (VLDL remnants) from the blood, thus reducing LDL (Figure 35-2). Because of marked first-pass hepatic extraction, the major effect is on liver. Preferential activity in liver of some congeners appears to be attributable to tissue-specific differences in uptake. Modest decreases in plasma triglycerides and small increases in HDL also occur.

\section*{Therapeutic Uses \& Dosage}

Reductase inhibitors are useful alone or with resins, niacin, or ezetimibe in reducing levels of LDL. Women who are pregnant, lactating, or likely to become pregnant should not be given these agents. Use in children is restricted to those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and selected patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

Because cholesterol synthesis occurs predominantly at night, reductase inhibitors-except atorvastatin and rosuvastatin-should be given in the evening if a single daily dose is used. Absorption generally (with the exception of pravastatin) is enhanced by food. Daily doses of lovastatin vary from 10 mg to 80 mg . Pravastatin is nearly as potent on a mass basis as lovastatin up to the maximum recommended daily dose, 80 mg . Simvastatin is twice as potent and is given in doses of $5-80 \mathrm{mg}$ daily. Fluvastatin appears to be about half as potent as lovastatin on a mass basis and is given in doses of $10-80 \mathrm{mg}$ daily. Atorvastatin is given in doses of $10-80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, and rosuvastatin, the most efficacious agent for severe hypercholesterolemia, at $5-40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. The dose-response curves of pravastatin and especially of fluvastatin tend to level off in the upper part of the dosage range in patients with moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia. Those of lovastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin are somewhat more linear.

\section*{Toxicity}

Elevations of serum aminotransferase activity (up to three times normal) occur in some patients. This is often intermittent and usually not associated with other evidence of hepatic toxicity. Therapy may be continued in such patients in the absence of symptoms if aminotransferase levels are monitored and stable. In some patients, who may have underlying liver disease or a history of alcohol abuse, levels may exceed three times normal. This finding portends more severe hepatic toxicity. These patients may present with malaise, anorexia, and precipitous decreases in LDL. Medication should be discontinued immediately in these patients and in asymptomatic patients whose aminotransferase activity is persistently elevated to more than three times the upper limit of normal. These agents should be used with caution and in reduced dosage in patients with hepatic parenchymal disease, Asians, and the elderly. In general, aminotransferase activity should be measured at baseline, at 1-2 months, and then every 6-12 months (if stable).

Minor increases in creatine kinase (CK) activity in plasma are observed in some patients receiving reductase inhibitors, frequently associated with heavy physical activity. Rarely, patients may have marked elevations in CK activity, often accompanied by generalized discomfort or weakness in skeletal muscles. If the drug is not discontinued, rhabdomyolysis may cause myoglobinuria, leading to renal injury. Myopathy may occur with monotherapy, but there is an increased incidence in patients receiving certain other drugs.

The catabolism of lovastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin proceeds chiefly through CYP3A4, whereas that of fluvastatin and rosuvastatin is mediated by CYP2C9. Pravastatin is catabolized through other pathways, including sulfation. The 3A4-dependent reductase inhibitors tend to accumulate in plasma in the presence of drugs that inhibit or compete for the 3A4 cytochrome. These include the macrolide antibiotics, cyclosporine, ketoconazole and its congeners, HIV protease inhibitors, tacrolimus, nefazodone, fibrates, and others (see

Chapter 4). Concomitant use of reductase inhibitors with amiodarone or verapamil also causes an increased risk of myopathy. Conversely, drugs such as phenytoin, griseofulvin, barbiturates, rifampin, and thiazolidinediones increase expression of CYP3A4 and can reduce the plasma concentrations of the 3A4dependent reductase inhibitors. Inhibitors of CYP2C9 such as ketoconazole and its congeners, metronidazole, sulfinpyrazone, amiodarone, and cimetidine may increase plasma levels of fluvastatin and rosuvastatin. Pravastatin appears to be the drug of choice for use with verapamil, the ketoconazole group of antifungal agents, macrolides, and cyclosporine. Plasma levels of lovastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin may be elevated in patients ingesting more than 1 liter of grapefruit juice daily.

Creatine kinase activity should be measured in patients receiving potentially interacting drug combinations. In all patients, CK should be measured at baseline. If muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness appears, CK should be measured immediately and the drug discontinued if activity is elevated significantly over baseline. The myopathy usually reverses promptly upon cessation of therapy. If the association is unclear, the patient can be rechallenged under close surveillance. Myopathy in the absence of elevated CK has been reported. Rarely, hypersensitivity syndromes have been reported that include a lupus-like disorder and peripheral neuropathy.

These drugs should be temporarily discontinued in the event of serious illness, trauma, or major surgery.

\section*{NIACIN (NICOTINICACID)}

Niacin (but not niacinamide) decreases VLDL and LDL levels, and Lp(a) in most patients. It often increases HDL levels significantly.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Niacin (vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{3}$ ) is converted in the body to the amide, which is incorporated into niacinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). It is excreted in the urine unmodified and as several metabolites.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Niacin inhibits VLDL secretion, in turn decreasing production of LDL (Figure 35-2). Increased clearance of VLDL via the LPL pathway contributes to reduction of triglycerides. Niacin has no effect on bile acid production. Excretion of neutral sterols in the stool is increased acutely as cholesterol is mobilized from tissue pools and a new steady state is reached. The catabolic rate for HDL is decreased. Fibrinogen levels are reduced, and levels of tissue plasminogen activator appear to increase. Niacin inhibits the intracellular lipase of adipose tissue via receptor-mediated signaling, possibly reducing VLDL production by decreasing the flux of free fatty acids to the liver. Sustained inhibition of lipolysis has not been established, however.

\section*{Therapeutic Uses \& Dosage}

In combination with a resin or reductase inhibitor, niacin normalizes LDL in most patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and other forms of hypercholesterolemia. These combinations are also indicated in some cases of nephrosis. In severe mixed lipemia that is incompletely responsive to diet, niacin often produces marked reduction of triglycerides, an effect enhanced by marine omega-3 fatty acids. It is useful in patients with combined hyperlipidemia and in those with dysbetalipoproteinemia. It is clearly the most effective agent for increasing HDL and the only agent that may reduce Lp(a).

For treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, most patients require 2-6 g of niacin daily; more than this should not be given. For other types of hypercholesterolemia and for hypertriglyceridemia,
$1.5-3.5 \mathrm{~g}$ daily is often sufficient. Crystalline niacin should be given in divided doses with meals, starting with 100 mg two or three times daily and increasing gradually.

\section*{Toxicity}

Most persons experience a harmless cutaneous vasodilation and sensation of warmth after each dose when the drug is started or the dose increased. Taking $81-325 \mathrm{mg}$ of aspirin one half hour beforehand blunts this prostaglandin-mediated effect. Ibuprofen, once daily, also mitigates the flush. Tachyphylaxis to flushing usually occurs within a few days at doses above $1.5-3 \mathrm{~g}$ daily. Patients should be warned to expect the flush and understand that it is a harmless side effect. Pruritus, rashes, dry skin or mucous membranes, and acanthosis nigricans have been reported. The latter contraindicates use of niacin because of its association with insulin resistance. Some patients experience nausea and abdominal discomfort. Many can continue the drug at reduced dosage, with inhibitors of gastric acid secretion, or use of antacids not containing aluminum. Niacin should be avoided in most patients with severe peptic disease.

Reversible elevations in aminotransferases up to twice normal may occur, usually not associated with liver toxicity. However, liver function should be monitored at baseline and at appropriate intervals. Rarely, true hepatotoxicity may occur, and in these cases the drug should be discontinued. The association of severe hepatic dysfunction, including acute necrosis, with the use of over-the-counter sustained-release preparations of niacin has been reported. This effect has not been noted to date with one preparation, Niaspan, given at bedtime in doses of 2 g or less. Carbohydrate tolerance may be moderately impaired, but this is usually reversible except in some patients with latent diabetes. Niacin may be given to diabetics who are receiving insulin and to some receiving oral agents if insulin resistance is not increased. Hyperuricemia occurs in some patients and occasionally precipitates gout. Allopurinol can be given with niacin if needed. Rarely, niacin is associated with arrhythmias, mostly atrial, and a reversible toxic amblyopia. Patients should be instructed to report blurring of distance vision. Niacin may potentiate the action of antihypertensive agents, requiring adjustment of their dosages. Birth defects have been reported in animals given very high dosages.

\section*{FIBRIC ACID DERI VATI VES (FI BRATES)}

Gemfibrozil and fenofibrate decrease levels of VLDL and, in some patients, LDL as well. Another fibrate, bezafibrate, is not yet available in the USA.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Gemfibrozil is absorbed quantitatively from the intestine and is tightly bound to plasma proteins. It undergoes enterohepatic circulation and readily passes the placenta. The plasma half-life is 1.5 hours. Seventy percent is eliminated through the kidneys, mostly unmodified. The liver modifies some of the drug to hydroxymethyl, carboxyl, or quinol derivatives. Fenofibrate is a methylethyl ester that is hydrolyzed completely in the intestine. Its plasma half-life is 20 hours. Sixty percent is excreted in the urine as the glucuronide, and about $25 \%$ in feces.

Gemfibrozil
<smiles>CCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)C(C)(C)Oc1ccc(C(=O)c2ccc(Cl)cc2)cc1</smiles>

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

These agents function primarily as ligands for the nuclear transcription receptor, peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor-alpha (PPAR-(i).). They increase lipolysis of lipoprotein triglyceride via LPL. Intracellular lipolysis in adipose tissue is decreased. Levels of VLDL decrease, in part as a result of decreased secretion by the liver. Only modest reductions of LDL occur in most patients. In others, especially those with combined hyperlipidemia, LDL often increases as triglycerides are reduced. HDL cholesterol increases moderately. Part of this apparent increase is a consequence of decreasing triglycerides in plasma, with reduction in exchange of triglycerides into HDL in place of cholesteryl esters. Some increase in HDL protein has been reported.

\section*{Therapeutic Uses \& Dosage}

These drugs are useful in hypertriglyceridemias in which VLDL predominate and in dysbetalipoproteinemia. They also may be of benefit in treating the hypertriglyceridemia that results from treatment with viral protease inhibitors. The usual dose of gemfibrozil is 600 mg orally once or twice daily. The dosage of fenofibrate (as Tricor) is one to three 48 mg tablets (or a single 145 mg tablet) daily. Absorption of gemfibrozil is improved when the drug is taken with food.

\section*{Toxicity}

Rare adverse effects include rashes, gastrointestinal symptoms, myopathy, arrhythmias, hypokalemia, and high blood levels of aminotransferases or alkaline phosphatase. A few patients show decreases in white blood count or hematocrit. Both agents potentiate the action of coumarin and indanedione anticoagulants, and doses of these agents should be adjusted. Rhabdomyolysis has occurred rarely. Risk of myopathy increases when fibrates are given with reductase inhibitors. The use of fenofibrate with rosuvastatin appears to minimize this risk. Fibrates should be avoided in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. There appears to be a modest increase in the risk of cholesterol gallstones, reflecting an increase in the cholesterol content of bile. Therefore, fibrates should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease or in those at high risk such as women, obese patients, and Native Americans.

\section*{BILE ACID-BINDING RESINS}

Colestipol, cholestyramine, and colesevelam are useful only for isolated increases in LDL. In patients who also have hypertriglyceridemia, VLDL levels may be further increased during treatment with resins.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

These agents are large polymeric cationic exchange resins that are insoluble in water. They bind bile acids in the intestinal lumen and prevent their reabsorption. The resin itself is not absorbed.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

The bile acids, metabolites of cholesterol, are normally efficiently reabsorbed in the jejunum and ileum (Figure 35-2). Excretion is increased up to tenfold when resins are given, resulting in enhanced conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in liver via 7a-hydroxylation, which is normally controlled by negative feedback by bile acids. Increased uptake of LDL and IDL from plasma results from up-regulation of LDL receptors, particularly in liver. Therefore, the resins are without effect in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who have no functioning receptors but may be useful in patients with receptordefective combined heterozygous states.

\section*{Therapeutic Uses \& Dosage}

The resins are used in treatment of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, producing approximately 20\% reduction in LDL cholesterol in maximal dosage. If resins are used to treat LDL elevations in persons with combined hyperlipidemia, they may cause an increase in VLDL requiring the addition of a second agent such as niacin. Resins are also used in combination with other drugs to achieve further hypocholesterolemic effect (see below). They may be helpful in relieving pruritus in patients who have cholestasis and bile salt accumulation. Because the resins bind digitalis glycosides, they may be useful in digitalis toxicity.

Colestipol and cholestyramine are available as granular preparations. A gradual increase of dosage of granules from 4 or $5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ to $20 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ is recommended. Total dosages of $30-32 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ may be needed for maximum effect. The usual dosage for a child is $10-20 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$. Granular resins are mixed with juice or water and allowed to hydrate for 1 minute. Colestipol is also available in 1 g tablets that must be swallowed whole, with a maximum dose of 16 g daily. Colesevelam is available in 625 mg tablets. The maximum dose is six tablets daily. Resins should be taken in two or three doses with meals. They lack effect when taken between meals.

\section*{Toxicity}

Common complaints are constipation and bloating, usually relieved by increasing dietary fiber or mixing psyllium seed with the resin. Resins should be avoided in patients with diverticulitis. Heartburn and diarrhea are occasionally reported. In patients who have preexisting bowel disease or cholestasis, steatorrhea may occur. Malabsorption of vitamin K occurs rarely, leading to hypoprothrombinemia. Prothrombin time should be measured frequently in patients who are taking resins and anticoagulants. Malabsorption of folic acid has been reported rarely. Increased formation of gallstones, particularly in obese persons, was an anticipated adverse effect but has rarely occurred in practice.

Absorption of certain drugs, including those with neutral or cationic charge as well as anions, may be impaired by the resins. These include digitalis glycosides, thiazides, warfarin, tetracycline, thyroxine, iron salts, pravastatin, fluvastatin, folic acid, phenylbutazone, aspirin, and ascorbic acid. Any additional medication (except niacin) should be given 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after the resin to ensure adequate absorption. Colesevelam does not bind digoxin, warfarin, or reductase inhibitors.

\section*{I NHI BITORS OF I NTESTI NAL STEROL ABSORPTI ON}

Ezetimibe is the first member of a group of drugs that inhibit intestinal absorption of phytosterols and cholesterol. Its primary clinical effect is reduction of LDL levels.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Ezetimibe is readily absorbed and conjugated in the intestine to an active glucuronide, reaching peak blood levels in 12-14 hours. It undergoes enterohepatic circulation and its half-life is 22 hours. Approximately $80 \%$ of the drug is excreted in feces. Plasma concentrations are substantially increased when it is administered with fibrates and reduced when it is given with cholestyramine. Other resins may also decrease its absorption. There are no significant interactions with warfarin or digoxin.

Ezetimibe

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Ezetimibe is a selective inhibitor of intestinal absorption of cholesterol and phytosterols. A transport protein, NPC1L1, appears to be the target of the drug. It is effective even in the absence of dietary cholesterol because it inhibits reabsorption of cholesterol excreted in the bile.

\section*{Therapeutic Uses \& Dosage}

The effect on cholesterol absorption is constant over the dosage range of $5-20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. Therefore, a single daily dose of 10 mg is used. Average reduction in LDL cholesterol with ezetimibe alone in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia is about 18\%, with minimal increases in HDL cholesterol. It is also effective in patients with phytosterolemia. Ezetimibe is synergistic with reductase inhibitors, producing decrements as great as $25 \%$ in LDL cholesterol beyond that achieved with the reductase inhibitor alone.

\section*{Toxicity}

Ezetimibe does not appear to be a substrate for cytochrome P450 enzymes. Experience to date reveals a low incidence of reversible impaired hepatic function with a small increase in incidence when given with a reductase inhibitor. Myositis has been reported rarely.

\section*{TREATMENT WITH DRUG COMBINATIONS}

Combined drug therapy is useful (1) when VLDL levels are significantly increased during treatment of hypercholesterolemia with a resin; (2) when LDL and VLDL levels are both elevated initially; (3) when LDL or VLDL levels are not normalized with a single agent, or (4) when an elevated level of Lp(a) or an HDL deficiency coexists with other hyperlipidemias.

Fibric Acid Derivatives \& Bile Acid- Binding Resins

This combination is sometimes useful in treating patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia who are intolerant of niacin or statins. However, it may increase the risk of cholelithiasis.

\section*{HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors \& Bile Acid- Binding Resins}

This synergistic combination is useful in the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia but may not control levels of VLDL in some patients with familial combined hyperlipoproteinemia. Statins should be given at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after the resin to ensure their absorption.

\section*{Niacin \& Bile Acid- Binding Resins}

This combination effectively controls VLDL levels during resin therapy of familial combined hyperlipoproteinemia or other disorders involving both increased VLDL and LDL levels. When VLDL and LDL levels are both initially increased, doses of niacin as low as $1-3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ may be sufficient in combination with a resin. The niacin-resin combination is effective for treating heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

The drugs may be taken together, because niacin does not bind to the resins. LDL levels in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia require daily doses of up to 6 g of niacin with 24-30 g of resin.

\section*{Niacin \& Reductase Inhibitors}

This regimen is more effective than either agent alone in treating hypercholesterolemia. Experience indicates that it is an efficacious and practical combination for treatment of familial combined hyperlipoproteinemia.

\section*{Reductase Inhibitors \& Ezetimibe}

This combination is highly synergistic in treating primary hypercholesterolemia and has some use in the treatment of patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who have some receptor function.

\section*{Reductase Inhibitors \& Fibrates}

Fenofibrate appears to be complementary with rosuvastatin or pravastatin in the treatment of familial combined hyperlipoproteinemia and other conditions involving elevations of both LDL and VLDL. The combination of fenofibrate with rosuvastatin is particularly effective. Other statins may interact unfavorably due to effects on cytochrome P450 metabolism.

\section*{Ternary Combination of Resins, Ezetimibe, Niacin, \& Reductase I nhibitors}

These agents act in a complementary fashion to normalize cholesterol in patients with severe disorders involving elevated LDL. The effects are sustained, and little compound toxicity has been observed. Effective doses of the individual drugs may be lower than when each is used alone-eg, as little as 1-2 g of niacin may substantially increase the effects of the other agents.

\section*{THE I MMUNE RESPONSE}

The immune response occurs when immunologically competent cells are activated in response to foreign organisms or antigenic substances liberated during the acute or chronic inflammatory response. The outcome of the immune response for the host may be beneficial, as when it causes invading organisms to be phagocytosed or neutralized. On the other hand, the outcome may be deleterious if it leads to chronic inflammation without resolution of the underlying injurious process (see Chapter 56). Chronic inflammation involves the release of a number of mediators that are not prominent in the acute response. One of the most important conditions involving these mediators is rheumatoid arthritis, in which chronic inflammation results in pain and destruction of bone and cartilage that can lead to severe disability and in which systemic changes occur that can result in shortening of life.

The cell damage associated with inflammation acts on cell membranes to cause leukocytes to release lysosomal enzymes; arachidonic acid is then liberated from precursor compounds, and various eicosanoids are synthesized. As discussed in Chapter 18, the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway of arachidonate metabolism produces prostaglandins, which have a variety of effects on blood vessels, on nerve endings, and on cells involved in inflammation. The discovery of cyclooxygenase isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) led to the concepts that the constitutive COX-1 isoform tends to be homeostatic in function, while COX-2 is induced during inflammation and tends to facilitate the inflammatory response. On this basis, highly selective COX-2 inhibitors have been developed and marketed on the assumption that such selective inhibitors would be safer than nonselective COX-1 inhibitors but without loss of efficacy. The lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonate metabolism yields leukotrienes, which have a powerful chemotactic effect on eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages and promote bronchoconstriction and alterations in vascular permeability.

Kinins, neuropeptides, and histamine are also released at the site of tissue injury, as are complement components, cytokines, and other products of leukocytes and platelets. Stimulation of the neutrophil membranes produces oxygen-derived free radicals. Superoxide anion is formed by the reduction of molecular oxygen, which may stimulate the production of other reactive molecules such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. The interaction of these substances with arachidonic acid results in the generation of chemotactic substances, thus perpetuating the inflammatory process.

\section*{THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES}

The treatment of patients with inflammation involves two primary goals: first, the relief of pain, which is often the presenting symptom and the major continuing complaint of the patient; and second, the slowing or-in theory-arrest of the tissue-damaging process. In rheumatoid arthritis, response to therapy can be quantitated by means of the American College of Rheumatology scoring system values ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70, which denote the percentage of patients showing an improvement of $20 \%, 50 \%$, or $70 \%$ in a global assessment of signs and symptoms.

Reduction of inflammation with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) often results in relief of pain for significant periods. Furthermore, most of the nonopioid analgesics (aspirin, etc) also have antiinflammatory effects, so they are appropriate for the treatment of both acute and chronic inflammatory conditions.

The glucocorticoids also have powerful anti-inflammatory effects and when first introduced were considered to be the ultimate answer to the treatment of inflammatory arthritis. Although there are increasing data that low-dose corticosteroids have disease-modifying properties, the toxicity associated with chronic corticosteroid therapy usually limits their use except in the control of acute flare-ups of joint disease. The NSAIDs continue to have a significant role in the long-term treatment of arthritis.

Another important group of agents is characterized as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). They slow the bone damage associated with rheumatoid arthritis and are thought to affect more basic inflammatory mechanisms than do the NSAIDs. They may also be more toxic than the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.

\section*{NONSTEROI DAL ANTI-I NFLAMMATORY DRUGS}

Salicylates and other similar agents used to treat rheumatic disease share the capacity to suppress the signs and symptoms of inflammation. These drugs also exert antipyretic and analgesic effects, but it is their anti-inflammatory properties that make them most useful in the management of disorders in which pain is related to the intensity of the inflammatory process.

Although all NSAIDs are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the whole range of rheumatic diseases, all are probably effective in rheumatoid arthritis, seronegative spondyloarthropathies (eg, psoriatic arthritis and arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease), osteoarthritis, localized musculoskeletal syndromes (eg, sprains and strains, low back pain), and gout (except tolmetin, which appears to be ineffective in gout). Since aspirin, the original NSAID, has a number of adverse effects, many other NSAIDs have been developed in attempts to improve upon aspirin's efficacy and decrease its toxicity.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

The NSAIDs are grouped in several chemical classes, some of which are shown in Figure 36-1. This chemical diversity yields a broad range of pharmacokinetic characteristics (Table 36-1). Although there are many differences in the kinetics of NSAIDs, they have some general properties in common. All but one of the NSAIDs are weak organic acids as given; the exception, nabumetone, is a ketone prodrug that is metabolized to the acidic active drug. Most of these drugs are well absorbed, and food does not substantially change their bioavailability. Most of the NSAIDs are highly metabolized, some by phase I followed by phase II mechanisms and others by direct glucuronidation (phase II) alone. NSAID metabolism proceeds, in large part, by way of the CYP3A or CYP2C families of P450 enzymes in the liver. While renal excretion is the most important route for final elimination, nearly all undergo varying degrees of biliary excretion and reabsorption (enterohepatic circulation). In fact, the degree of lower gastrointestinal tract irritation correlates with the amount of enterohepatic circulation. Most of the NSAIDs are highly proteinbound ( $\sim 98 \%$ ), usually to albumin. Some of the NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen) are racemic mixtures, while one, naproxen, is provided as a single enantiomer and a few have no chiral center (eg, diclofenac).

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

The anti-inflammatory activity of the NSAIDs is mediated chiefly through inhibition of biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Various NSAIDs have additional possible mechanisms of action, including inhibition of chemotaxis, down-regulation of interleukin-1 production, decreased production of free radicals and superoxide, and interference with calcium-mediated intracellular events. Aspirin irreversibly acetylates and blocks platelet cyclooxygenase, while most non-COX-selective NSAIDs are reversible inhibitors.

Selectivity for COX-1 versus COX-2 is variable and incomplete for the older members, but the highly selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, is currently available and other highly selective coxibs are being developed. The highly selective COX-2 inhibitors do not affect platelet function at their usual doses. In testing using human whole blood, aspirin, indomethacin, piroxicam, and sulindac were somewhat more effective in inhibiting COX-1; ibuprofen and meclofenamate inhibited the two isozymes about equally. The efficacy of COX-2-selective drugs equals that of the older NSAIDs, while gastrointestinal safety may be improved. On the other hand, highly selective COX-2 inhibitors may increase the incidence of edema and hypertension. As of August 2006, celecoxib is the only COX-2 inhibitor marketed in the USA. Rofecoxib and valdecoxib, two previously marketed, highly selective COX-2 inhibitors, have been withdrawn from the market due to their association with increased cardiovascular thrombotic events. In early 2005 a joint meeting of the Arthritis Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee conducted by the FDA convened to assess the risk and give recommendations concerning the COX-2 inhibitors and other NSAIDs. It was concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to withdraw the COX-2 inhibitors but "black box" warnings concerning the cardiovascular risks were added to the product label. Additionally, it was recommended that all other NSAID product labels be revised to include cardiovascular risks. Presently, the future of the COX-2 inhibitors is unclear.

The NSAIDs decrease the sensitivity of vessels to bradykinin and histamine, affect lymphokine production from T lymphocytes, and reverse the vasodilation of inflammation. To varying degrees, all newer NSAIDs are analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic, and all (except the COX-2-selective agents and the nonacetylated salicylates) inhibit platelet aggregation. NSAIDs are all gastric irritants as well, although as a group the newer agents tend to cause less gastric irritation than aspirin. Nephrotoxicity has been observed for all of the drugs for which extensive experience has been reported, and hepatotoxicity can also occur with any NSAID. Nephrotoxicity is due, in part, to interference with the autoregulation of renal blood flow, which is modulated by prostaglandins.

Although these drugs effectively inhibit inflammation, there is no evidence that-in contrast to drugs such as methotrexate and gold-they alter the course of an arthritic disorder.

Several NSAIDs (including aspirin) appear to reduce the incidence of colon cancer when taken chronically. Several large epidemiologic studies have shown a $50 \%$ reduction in relative risk when the drugs are taken for 5 years or longer. The mechanism for this protective effect is unclear.

\section*{ASPIRIN}

Aspirin's long use and availability without prescription diminishes its glamour compared with that of the newer NSAIDs. Aspirin is now rarely used as an anti-inflammatory medication; it has been replaced by ibuprofen and naproxen, since they are effective, are also available over the counter, and have good to excellent safety records.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Salicylic acid is a simple organic acid with a $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}$ of 3.0. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid; ASA) has a $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}$ of 3.5 (see Table 1-1). Sodium salicylate and aspirin (Figure 36-2) are equally effective anti-inflammatory drugs, though aspirin may be more effective as an analgesic. The salicylates are rapidly absorbed from the stomach and upper small intestine, yielding a peak plasma salicylate level within 1-2 hours. Aspirin is absorbed as such and is rapidly hydrolyzed (serum half-life 15 minutes) to acetic acid and salicylate by esterases in tissue and blood. Salicylate is bound to albumin, but the binding and metabolism of salicylates are saturable so that the unbound fraction increases as total concentration increases. Beyond a total body load of 600 mg , increases in salicylate dosage increase salicylate concentration disproportionately. As doses of aspirin increase, salicylate elimination half-life increases from $3-5$ hours (for $600 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ dosage) to $12-16$ hours (dosage > $3.6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ ). Alkalinization of the urine increases the rate of excretion of free salicylate and its water-soluble conjugates.

\section*{Mechanisms of Action}

\section*{ANTI-I NFLAMMATORY EFFECTS}

Aspirin is a nonselective inhibitor of both COX isoforms (Figure 36-3), but salicylate is much less effective in inhibiting either isoform. Nonacetylated salicylates may work as oxygen radical scavengers. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX and inhibits platelet aggregation, while nonacetylated salicylates do not.

\section*{ANALGESIC EFFECTS}

Aspirin is most effective in reducing pain of mild to moderate intensity through its effects on inflammation and because it probably inhibits pain stimuli at a subcortical site.

\section*{ANTI PYRETI C EFFECTS}

Aspirin's antipyretic effect is probably mediated by both COX inhibition in the central nervous system and inhibition of interleukin-1 (which is released from macrophages during episodes of inflammation).

\section*{ANTI PLATELET EFFECTS}

Aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet COX, so that aspirin's antiplatelet effect lasts 8-10 days (the life of the platelet).

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{ANALGESIA, ANTI PYRESIS, AND ANTI-I NFLAMMATORY EFFECTS}

Aspirin is employed for mild to moderate pain of varied origin but is not effective for severe visceral pain. Aspirin and other NSAIDs have been combined with opioid analgesics for treatment of cancer pain, where their anti-inflammatory effects act synergistically with the opioids to enhance analgesia. High-dose salicylates are effective for treatment of rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory joint conditions.

\section*{OTHER EFFECTS}

Aspirin decreases the incidence of transient ischemic attacks, unstable angina, coronary artery thrombosis with myocardial infarction, and thrombosis after coronary artery bypass grafting (see Chapter 34).

Epidemiologic studies suggest that long-term use of aspirin at low dosage is associated with a lower incidence of colon cancer, possibly related to its COX-inhibiting effects.

\section*{Dosage}

The optimal analgesic or antipyretic dose of aspirin is less than the $0.6-0.65 \mathrm{~g}$ oral dose commonly used. The anti-inflammatory dose for children is $50-75 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in divided doses and the average starting antiinflammatory dose for adults is $45 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in divided doses (Table 36-1).

\section*{Adverse Effects}

At the usual dosage, aspirin's main adverse effects are gastric upset (intolerance) and gastric and duodenal ulcers; hepatotoxicity, asthma, rashes, and renal toxicity occur less frequently. A dose-related increase in fecal blood loss is routinely associated with aspirin administration, although some mucosal adaptation occurs in many patients, so that blood loss declines back to baseline over 4-6 weeks.

With higher doses, patients may experience salicylism -vomiting, tinnitus, decreased hearing, and vertigo-reversible by reducing the dosage. Still larger doses of salicylates cause hyperpnea through a direct effect on the medulla. At toxic salicylate levels, respiratory alkalosis followed by metabolic acidosis (salicylate accumulation), respiratory depression, and even cardiotoxicity and glucose intolerance can occur. Like other NSAIDs, aspirin can cause elevation of liver enzymes (a frequent but mild effect), hepatitis (rare), decreased renal function, bleeding, rashes, and asthma.

The antiplatelet action of aspirin contraindicates its use by patients with hemophilia. Although previously not recommended during pregnancy, aspirin may be valuable in treating preeclampsia-eclampsia.

Salicylate overdosage constitutes a medical emergency and requires hospitalization (see Chapter 59).

\section*{NONACETYLATED SALI CYLATES}

These drugs include magnesium choline salicylate, sodium salicylate, and salicylsalicylate. All nonacetylated salicylates are effective anti-inflammatory drugs, although they may be less effective analgesics than aspirin. Because they are much less effective than aspirin as COX inhibitors, they may be preferable when COX inhibition is undesirable, such as in patients with asthma, those with bleeding tendencies, and even (under close supervision) those with renal dysfunction.

The nonacetylated salicylates are administered in the same dosage as aspirin and can be monitored using serum salicylate measurements.

\section*{COX-2 Selective I nhibitors}

COX-2 selective inhibitors, or coxibs, were developed in an attempt to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis by the COX-2 isoenzyme induced at sites of inflammation without affecting the action of the constitutively active "housekeeping" COX-1 isoenzyme found in the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and platelets. COXibs selectively bind to and block the active site of the COX-2 enzyme much more effectively than that of COX1. COX-2 inhibitors have analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects similar to those of nonselective NSAIDs but with an approximate halving of gastrointestinal adverse effects. Likewise, COX-2 inhibitors at usual doses have been shown to have no impact on platelet aggregation, which is mediated by the COX-1 isoenzyme. As a result, COX-2 inhibitors do not offer the cardioprotective effects of traditional nonselective NSAIDs, which has resulted in some patients taking low-dose aspirin in addition to a coxib regimen to maintain this effect. Unfortunately, because COX-2 is constitutively active within the kidney, recommended doses of COX-2 inhibitors cause renal toxicities similar to those associated with traditional NSAIDs. Clinical data have suggested a higher incidence of cardiovascular thrombotic events associated with COX-2 inhibitors such as rofecoxib and valdecoxib, resulting in their withdrawal from the market.

\section*{Celecoxib}

Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor-about 10-20 times more selective for COX-2 than for COX-1. Pharmacokinetic and dosage considerations are given in Table 36-1.
<smiles>Cc1ccc(-c2cc(C(F)(F)F)nn2-c2ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc2)cc1</smiles>

\section*{Celecoxib}

Celecoxib is as effective as other NSAIDs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, and in
trials it has caused fewer endoscopic ulcers than most other NSAIDs. Probably because it is a sulfonamide, celecoxib may cause rashes. It does not affect platelet aggregation at usual doses. It interacts occasionally with warfarin-as would be expected of a drug metabolized via CYP2C9.

Although celecoxib is associated with about half the gastrointestinal side effects of nonselective NSAIDs, the frequency of other adverse effects approximates that of other NSAIDs. Celecoxib causes no more edema or renal effects than other members of the NSAID group, but edema and hypertension have been documented.

\section*{Etoricoxib}

Etoricoxib, a bipyridine derivative, is a second-generation COX-2-selective inhibitor with the highest selectivity ratio of any coxib for inhibition of COX-2 relative to COX-1. It is extensively metabolized by hepatic P450 enzymes followed by renal excretion and has an elimination half-life of 22 hours. Etoricoxib is approved in the United Kingdom for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis ( 60 mg once daily) and rheumatoid arthritis ( 90 mg once daily), for treatment of acute gouty arthritis ( 120 mg once daily), and for relief of acute musculoskeletal pain ( 60 mg once daily). Approval in the USA is still pending. Ninety mg daily of etoricoxib has superior efficacy compared with 500 mg of naproxen twice daily in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis over 12 weeks. Etoricoxib has similar efficacy to traditional NSAIDs for osteoarthritis, acute gouty arthritis, and primary dysmenorrhea and has a gastrointestinal safety profile similar to that of other coxibs. Since etoricoxib has structural similarities to diclofenac, it is appropriate to monitor hepatic function carefully in patients using this drug.

\section*{Meloxicam}

Meloxicam is an enolcarboxamide related to piroxicam that has been shown to preferentially inhibit COX-2 over COX-1, particularly at its lowest therapeutic dose of $7.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. It is not as selective as the other coxibs and may be considered "preferentially" selective rather than "highly" selective. The drug is popular in Europe and many other countries for most rheumatic diseases and has recently been approved for treatment of osteoarthritis in the USA. Its efficacy in this condition and rheumatoid arthritis is comparable to that of other NSAIDs. It is associated with fewer clinical gastrointestinal symptoms and complications than piroxicam, diclofenac, and naproxen. Similarly, while meloxicam is known to inhibit synthesis of thromboxane $A_{2}$, it appears that even at supratherapeutic doses its blockade of thromboxane $A_{2}$ does not reach levels that result in decreased in vivo platelet function. Other toxicities are similar to those of other NSAIDs.

\section*{Valdecoxib}

Valdecoxib, a diaryl-substituted isoxazole, is a new highly selective COX-2 inhibitor. Pharmacokinetic characteristics and dosage in arthritis are set forth in Table 36-1. The analgesic dose for valdecoxib is 20 mg twice daily. Gastrointestinal and other toxicities are similar to those of the other coxibs. Valdecoxib has no effect on platelet aggregation or bleeding time. Serious reactions have been reported in sulfonamidesensitive individuals. Valdecoxib was withdrawn from the market in the USA in early 2005 in response to FDA concerns about cardiovascular risks and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, but the drug is still available in other countries.

\section*{Valdecoxib}

\section*{NONSELECTIVE COX INHIBITORS}

\section*{Diclofenac}

Diclofenac is a phenylacetic acid derivative that is relatively nonselective as a COX inhibitor.
Pharmacokinetic and dosage characteristics are set forth in Table 36-1.
Adverse effects occur in approximately 20\% of patients and include gastrointestinal distress, occult gastrointestinal bleeding, and gastric ulceration, though ulceration may occur less frequently than with some other NSAIDs. A preparation combining diclofenac and misoprostol decreases upper gastrointestinal ulceration but may result in diarrhea. Another combination of diclofenac and omeprazole was also effective with respect to the prevention of recurrent bleeding, but renal adverse effects were common in high-risk patients. Diclofenac at a dosage of $150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ appears to impair renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Elevation of serum aminotransferases may occur more commonly with this drug than with other NSAIDs.

A $0.1 \%$ ophthalmic preparation is recommended for prevention of postoperative ophthalmic inflammation and can be used after intraocular lens implantation and strabismus surgery. A topical gel containing $3 \%$ diclofenac is effective for solar keratoses. Diclofenac in rectal suppository form can be considered a drug of choice for preemptive analgesia and postoperative nausea. In Europe, diclofenac is also available as an oral mouthwash and for intramuscular administration.

\section*{Diflunisal}

Although diflunisal is derived from salicylic acid, it is not metabolized to salicylic acid or salicylate. It undergoes an enterohepatic cycle with reabsorption of its glucuronide metabolite followed by cleavage of the glucuronide to again release the active moiety. Diflunisal is subject to capacity-limited metabolism, with serum half-lives at various dosages approximating that of salicylates (Table 36-1). In rheumatoid arthritis the recommended dose is $500-1000 \mathrm{mg}$ daily in two divided doses. It is claimed to be particularly effective for cancer pain with bone metastases and for pain control in dental (third molar) surgery. A $2 \%$ diflunisal oral ointment is a clinically useful analgesic for painful oral lesions.

Because its clearance depends on renal function as well as hepatic metabolism, diflunisal's dosage should be limited in patients with significant renal impairment. Its adverse event profile is similar to those of other NSAIDs; pseudoporphyria has also been reported.

\section*{Etodolac}

Etodolac is a racemic acetic acid derivative with an intermediate half-life (Table 36-1). It is slightly more COX-2-selective than most other NSAIDs, with a COX-2: COX-1 activity ratio of about 10. Unlike many other racemic NSAIDs, etodolac does not undergo chiral inversion in the body. The dosage of etodolac is 200-400 mg three to four times daily. Etodolac provides good postoperative pain relief after coronary artery bypass operations, although transient impairment of renal function has been reported. There are no data to suggest that etodolac differs significantly from other NSAIDs except in its pharmacokinetic parameters, though it has been claimed to cause less gastric toxicity in terms of ulcer disease than other nonselective NSAIDs.

\section*{Fenoprofen}

Fenoprofen, a propionic acid derivative, is the NSAID most closely associated with interstitial nephritis and is rarely used. Its other toxicities mirror those of other NSAIDs.

\section*{Flurbiprofen}

Flurbiprofen is a propionic acid derivative with a possibly more complex mechanism of action than other NSAIDs. Its (S) (-) enantiomer inhibits COX nonselectively, but it has been shown in rat tissue to also affect TNF-a. and nitric oxide synthesis. Hepatic metabolism is extensive; its (R) (+) and (S) (-) enantiomers are metabolized differently, and it does not undergo chiral conversion. It does demonstrate enterohepatic circulation.

The efficacy of flurbiprofen at dosages of $200-400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ is comparable to that of aspirin and other NSAIDs in clinical trials for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, gout, and osteoarthritis. It is also available in a topical ophthalmic formulation for inhibition of intraoperative miosis. Flurbiprofen intravenously has been found to be effective for perioperative analgesia in minor ear, neck, and nose surgery and in lozenge form for sore throat.

Although its adverse effect profile is similar to that of other NSAIDs in most ways, flurbiprofen is also associated rarely with cogwheel rigidity, ataxia, tremor, and myoclonus.

\section*{I buprofen}

Ibuprofen is a simple derivative of phenylpropionic acid. In doses of about 2400 mg daily, ibuprofen is equivalent to 4 g of aspirin in anti-inflammatory effect. Pharmacokinetic characteristics are given in Table 36-1.

Oral ibuprofen is often prescribed in lower doses ( $<2400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ), at which it has analgesic but not antiinflammatory efficacy. It is available over the counter in low-dose forms under several trade names. A topical cream preparation appears to be absorbed into fascia and muscle; an (S) (-) formulation has been tested. Ibuprofen cream was more effective than placebo cream for the treatment of primary knee osteoarthritis. A liquid gel preparation of ibuprofen 400 mg provides prompt relief and good overall efficacy in postsurgical dental pain. In comparison with indomethacin, ibuprofen decreases urine output less and also causes less fluid retention than indomethacin. Ibuprofen is effective in closing patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants, with much the same efficacy and safety as indomethacin. The oral and intravenous routes are equally effective for this indication.

Gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding occur, although less frequently than with aspirin. The use of
ibuprofen concomitantly with aspirin may decrease the total anti-inflammatory effect. The drug is relatively contraindicated in individuals with nasal polyps, angioedema, and bronchospastic reactivity to aspirin. In addition to the gastrointestinal symptoms (which can be modified by ingestion with meals), rash, pruritus, tinnitus, dizziness, headache, aseptic meningitis (particularly in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus), and fluid retention have been reported. Interaction with anticoagulants is uncommon.

The concomitant administration of ibuprofen antagonizes the irreversible platelet inhibition induced by aspirin. Thus, treatment with ibuprofen in patients with increased cardiovascular risk may limit the cardioprotective effects of aspirin. Rare hematologic effects include agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia. Effects on the kidney (as with all NSAI Ds) include acute renal failure, interstitial nephritis, and nephrotic syndrome, but these occur very rarely. Finally, hepatitis has been reported.

\section*{I ndomethacin}

Indomethacin, introduced in 1963, is an indole derivative (Figure 36-1). It is a potent nonselective COX inhibitor and may also inhibit phospholipase A and C, reduce neutrophil migration, and decrease T cell and B cell proliferation. Probenecid prolongs indomethacin's half-life by inhibiting both renal and biliary clearance. It differs somewhat from other NSAIDs in its indications and toxicities.

Indomethacin is indicated for use in rheumatic conditions and is particularly popular for gout and ankylosing spondylitis. In addition, it has been used to treat patent ductus arteriosus. Indomethacin has been tried in numerous small or uncontrolled trials for many other conditions, including Sweet's syndrome, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, pleurisy, nephrotic syndrome, diabetes insipidus, urticarial vasculitis, postepisiotomy pain, and prophylaxis of heterotopic ossification in arthroplasty. An ophthalmic preparation seems to be efficacious for conjunctival inflammation and to reduce pain after traumatic corneal abrasion. Gingival inflammation is reduced after administration of indomethacin oral rinse. Epidural injections produce a degree of pain relief similar to that achieved with methylprednisolone in postlaminectomy syndrome.

At higher dosages, at least a third of patients have reactions to indomethacin requiring discontinuance. The gastrointestinal effects may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and pancreatitis. Headache is experienced by 15-25\% of patients and may be associated with dizziness, confusion, and depression. Rarely, psychosis with hallucinations has been reported. Hepatic abnormalities are rare. Serious hematologic reactions have been noted, including thrombocytopenia and aplastic anemia. Hyperkalemia has been reported and is related to inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins in the kidney. Renal papillary necrosis has also been observed. A number of interactions with other drugs have been reported (see Appendix II).

\section*{Ketoprofen}

Ketoprofen is a propionic acid derivative that inhibits both COX (nonselectively) and lipoxygenase. Its pharmacokinetic characteristics are given in Table 36-1. Concurrent administration of probenecid elevates ketoprofen levels and prolongs its plasma half-life.

The effectiveness of ketoprofen at dosages of $100-300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ is equivalent to that of other NSAIDs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout, dysmenorrhea, and other painful conditions. In spite of its dual effect on prostaglandins and leukotrienes, ketoprofen is not superior to other NSAIDs. Its major adverse effects are on the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system.

\section*{Ketorolac}

Ketorolac is an NSAID promoted for systemic use mainly as an analgesic, not as an anti-inflammatory drug (although it has typical NSAID properties). Pharmacokinetics are presented in Table 36-1. The drug is an effective analgesic and has been used successfully to replace morphine in some situations involving mild to moderate postsurgical pain. It is most often given intramuscularly or intravenously, but an oral dose formulation is available. When used with an opioid, it may decrease the opioid requirement by $25-50 \%$. An ophthalmic preparation is available for ocular inflammatory conditions. Toxicities are similar to those of other NSAIDs, although renal toxicity may be more common with chronic use.

\section*{Meclofenamate \& Mefenamic Acid}

Meclofenamate and mefenamic acid (Table 36-1) inhibit both COX and phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}$. They are rarely used today.

\section*{Nabumetone}

Nabumetone is the only nonacid NSAID in current use; it is converted to the active acetic acid derivative in the body. It is given as a ketone prodrug that resembles naproxen in structure (Figure 36-1). Its half-life of more than 24 hours (Table 36-1) permits once-daily dosing, and the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic circulation. Renal impairment results in a doubling of its half-life and a $30 \%$ increase in the area under the curve. Its properties are very similar to those of other NSAIDs, though it may be less damaging to the stomach than some other NSAIDs when given at a dosage of $1000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. Unfortunately, higher doses (eg, 1500-2000 mg/d) are often needed, and this is a very expensive NSAID. Like naproxen, nabumetone has been reported to cause pseudoporphyria and photosensitivity in some patients. Other adverse effects mirror those of other NSAIDs.

\section*{Naproxen}

Naproxen is a naphthylpropionic acid derivative. It is the only NSAID presently marketed as a single enantiomer, and it is a nonselective COX inhibitor. Naproxen's free fraction is significantly higher in women than in men, although albumin binding is very high in both sexes (Table 36-1). Naproxen is effective for the usual rheumatologic indications and is available both in a slow-release formulation and as an oral suspension. A topical preparation and an ophthalmic solution are also available.

The incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in over-the-counter use is low but still double that of over-the-counter ibuprofen (perhaps due to a dose effect). Rare cases of allergic pneumonitis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and pseudoporphyria as well as the more common NSAID-associated adverse effects have been noted.

\section*{Oxaprozin}

Oxaprozin is another propionic acid derivative NSAID. As noted in Table 36-1, its major difference from the other members of this subgroup is a very long half-life (50-60 hours), although oxaprozin does not undergo enterohepatic circulation. The drug has the same benefits and risks that are associated with other NSAIDs. It is mildly uricosuric, making it potentially more useful in gout than some other NSAIDs.

\section*{Phenylbutazone}

Phenylbutazone, a pyrazolone derivative, rapidly gained favor after its introduction in 1949 but, because of its toxicity, is rarely used today.

\section*{Piroxicam}

Piroxicam, an oxicam (Figure 36-1), is a nonselective COX inhibitor that at high concentrations also inhibits polymorphonuclear leukocyte migration, decreases oxygen radical production, and inhibits lymphocyte function. Its long half-life (Table 36-1) permits once-daily dosing.

Piroxicam can be used for the usual rheumatic indications. Toxicity includes gastrointestinal symptoms (20\% of patients), dizziness, tinnitus, headache, and rash. When piroxicam is used in dosages higher than $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, an increased incidence of peptic ulcer and bleeding is encountered. Epidemiologic studies suggest that this risk is as much as 9.5 times higher with piroxicam than with other NSAIDs.

\section*{Sulindac}

Sulindac is a sulfoxide prodrug. It is reversibly metabolized to the active sulfide metabolite, which is excreted in bile and then reabsorbed from the intestine. The enterohepatic cycling prolongs the duration of action to 12-16 hours.

The indications and adverse reactions of sulindac are similar to those of other NSAIDs. In addition to its rheumatic disease indications, sulindac suppresses familial intestinal polyposis; it may inhibit the development of colon, breast, and prostate cancer in humans. It appears to inhibit the occurrence of gastrointestinal cancer in rats. The latter effect may be caused by the sulfone rather than the sulfide.

Among the more severe adverse reactions, Stevens-J ohnson epidermal necrolysis syndrome, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and nephrotic syndrome have all been observed. Like diclofenac, sulindac may have some propensity to cause elevation of serum aminotransferases; it is also sometimes associated with cholestatic liver damage, which disappears or becomes quiescent when the drug is stopped.

\section*{Tenoxicam}

Tenoxicam is an oxicam similar to piroxicam and shares its nonselective COX inhibition, long half-life (72 hours), efficacy, and toxicity profile. It is available abroad but not in the USA.

\section*{Tiaprofen}

Tiaprofen is a racemic propionic acid derivative but does not undergo stereoconversion. It has a short serum half-life (1-2 hours) with an increase to 2-4 hours in the elderly. This drug inhibits renal uric acid reabsorption and thus decreases serum uric acid slightly. It is available for oral and intramuscular administration. Its efficacy and adverse event profiles mirror those of other NSAIDs. Tiaprofen is not available in the USA.

\section*{Tolmetin}

Tolmetin is a nonselective COX inhibitor with a short half-life (1-2 hours) and is not often used. Its efficacy and toxicity profiles are similar to those of other NSAIDs with the following exceptions: it is ineffective (for unknown reasons) in the treatment of gout, and it may cause (rarely) thrombocytopenic purpura.

\section*{Azapropazone \& Carprofen}

These drugs are available in many other countries but are not sold in the USA. Azapropazone (apazone), a pyrazolone derivative, is structurally related to phenylbutazone but appears less likely to cause agranulocytosis. Its half-life of 12-16 hours may be doubled in patients with decreased renal function. Carprofen is a propionic acid derivative with a half-life of 10-16 hours. The indications and adverse effects
of azapropazone and carprofen are similar to those of other NSAIDs.

\section*{Clinical Pharmacology of the NSAI Ds}

All NSAIDs, including aspirin, are about equally efficacious with a few exceptions-tolmetin seems not to be effective for gout, and aspirin is less effective than other NSAIDs (eg, indomethacin) for ankylosing spondylitis. Thus, NSAIDs tend to be differentiated on the basis of toxicity and cost-effectiveness. For example, the gastrointestinal and renal side effects of ketorolac limit its use. Some surveys suggest that indomethacin, tolmetin, and meclofenamate are the NSAIDs associated with the greatest toxicity, while salsalate, aspirin, and ibuprofen are least toxic. The selective COX-2 inhibitors were not included in this analysis.

For patients with renal insufficiency, nonacetylated salicylates may be best. Fenoprofen is less often used because of its rare association with interstitial nephritis. Diclofenac and sulindac are associated with more liver function test abnormalities than other NSAIDs. The relatively expensive, selective COX-2 inhibitors are probably safest for patients at high risk for gastrointestinal bleeding but may have a higher risk of cardiovascular toxicity. Celecoxib or a nonselective NSAID plus omeprazole or misoprostol may be appropriate in patients at highest risk for gastrointestinal bleeding; in this subpopulation of patients, they are cost-effective despite their high acquisition costs.

The choice of an NSAID thus requires a balance of efficacy, cost-effectiveness, safety, and numerous personal factors (eg, other drugs also being used, concurrent illness, compliance, medical insurance coverage), so that there is no best NSAID for all patients. There may, however, be one or two best NSAIDs for a specific person.

\section*{DI SEASE-MODI FYI NG ANTI RHEUMATI C DRUGS (DMARDS)}

Careful clinical and epidemiologic studies have shown that rheumatoid arthritis is an immunologic disease that causes significant systemic effects which shorten life in addition to the joint disease that reduces mobility and quality of life. NSAIDs offer mainly symptomatic relief; they reduce inflammation and the pain it causes and often preserve function, but they have little effect on the progression of bone and cartilage destruction. Interest has therefore centered on finding treatments that might arrest-or at least slow-this progression by modifying the disease itself. The effects of disease-modifying therapies may take 6 weeks to 6 months to become evident; that is, they are slow-acting compared with NSAIDs. These therapies include methotrexate, azathioprine, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, organic gold compounds, sulfasalazine, several other immune-modulating agents, and immunoadsorption apheresis. Considerable controversy surrounds the long-term efficacy of many of these therapies.

\section*{METHOTREXATE}

Methotrexate is now considered the DMARD of first choice to treat rheumatoid arthritis and is used in up to $60 \%$ of patients. It is active in this condition at much lower doses than those needed in cancer chemotherapy (see Chapter 55).

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Methotrexate's principal mechanism of action at the low doses used in the rheumatic diseases probably relates to inhibition of aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase and thymidylate synthetase, with secondary effects on polymorphonuclear chemotaxis. There is some effect on
dihydrofolate reductase and this affects lymphocyte and macrophage function, but this is not its principal mechanism of action.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

The drug is approximately $70 \%$ absorbed after oral administration (see Chapter 55). It is metabolized to a less active hydroxylated metabolite, and both the parent compound and the metabolite are polyglutamated within cells, where they stay for prolonged periods. Methotrexate's serum half-life is usually only $6-9$ hours, although it may be as long as 24 hours in some individuals. Methotrexate's concentration is increased in the presence of hydroxychloroquine. This drug is excreted principally in the urine, but up to $30 \%$ may be excreted in bile.

\section*{Indications}

Although the most common methotrexate dosing regimen for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is $15-25 \mathrm{mg}$ weekly, there is an increased effect up to 30 or 35 mg weekly. The drug decreases the rate of appearance of new erosions. Evidence supports its use in juvenile chronic arthritis, and it has been used in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, Wegener's granulomatosis, giant cell arteritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Nausea and mucosal ulcers are the most common toxicities. Progressive dose-related hepatotoxicity in the form of enzyme elevation occurs frequently, but cirrhosis is rare ( $<1 \%$ ). Liver toxicity is not related to serum methotrexate concentrations, and liver biopsy follow-up is only recommended every 5 years. A rare "hypersensitivity" lung reaction with acute shortness of breath is documented, as are pseudolymphomatous reactions. The incidence of gastrointestinal and liver function test abnormalities can be reduced by the use of leucovorin 24 hours after each weekly dose or by the use of daily folic acid. This drug is contraindicated in pregnancy.

\section*{CHLORAMBUCIL}

\section*{Mechanism of Action \& Pharmacokinetics}

Chlorambucil, probably through its metabolite phenylacetic acid mustard, cross-links DNA, thereby preventing cell replication. Its bioavailability is about $70 \%$ and it is completely metabolized, with excretion completed within 24 hours.

\section*{Indications}

One controlled, double-blind trial plus anecdotal evidence attest to the efficacy of chlorambucil in rheumatoid arthritis. Chlorambucil has also been used in BehÃ§et's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, and other autoimmune disorders.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

The most common toxicity is dose-related bone marrow suppression. Infertility with azoospermia and amenorrhea also occurs. The risk of neoplasia is increased, with the relative risk of leukemia increased about tenfold compared with the general population, especially after more than 3 years of use.

\section*{CYCLOPHOSPHAMI DE}

Mechanism of Action

Cyclophosphamide's major active metabolite is phosphoramide mustard, which cross-links DNA to prevent cell replication. It suppresses T cell and B cell function by $30-40 \%$; T cell suppression correlates with clinical response in the rheumatic diseases.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

See Chapter 55.

\section*{Indications}

Cyclophosphamide is active against rheumatoid arthritis when given orally at dosages of $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ but not when given intravenously. It is used regularly to treat systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and other severe rheumatic diseases.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Cyclophosphamide causes significant dose-related infertility in both men and women as well as bone marrow suppression, alopecia, hemorrhagic cystitis, and, rarely, bladder carcinoma (see Chapter 55).

\section*{CYCLOSPORI NE}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Through regulation of gene transcription, cyclosporine inhibits interleukin-1 and interleukin-2 receptor production and secondarily inhibits macrophage-T cell interaction and T cell responsiveness (see Chapter 56). T cell-dependent $B$ cell function is also affected.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Cyclosporine absorption is incomplete and somewhat erratic, although a new microemulsion formulation improves its consistency and provides 20-30\% bioavailability. Grapefruit juice increases cyclosporine bioavailability by as much as $62 \%$. Cyclosporine is metabolized by CYP3A and consequently is subject to a large number of drug interactions (see Chapter 56 and Appendix II).

\section*{Indications}

Cyclosporine is approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis and retards the appearance of new bony erosions. Its usual dosage is $3-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ divided into two doses. Anecdotal reports suggest that it may be useful in systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis and dermatomyositis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and juvenile chronic arthritis.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Cyclosporine has significant nephrotoxicity, and its toxicity can be increased by drug interactions with diltiazem, potassium-sparing diuretics, and other drugs inhibiting CYP3A. Serum creatinine should be closely monitored. Other toxicities include hypertension, hyperkalemia, hepatotoxicity, gingival hyperplasia, and hirsutism.

\section*{AZATHI OPRI NE}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Azathioprine acts through its major metabolite, 6-thioguanine. 6-Thioguanine suppresses inosinic acid synthesis, B cell and T cell function, immunoglobulin production, and interleukin-2 secretion (see Chapter 56).

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

The metabolism of azathioprine is bimodal in the population, with rapid metabolizers clearing the drug four times more rapidly than slow metabolizers. Production of 6-thioguanine is dependent on thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), and patients with low or absent TPMT activity ( $0.3 \%$ of the population) are at particularly high risk of myelosuppression by excess concentrations of the parent drug if dosage is not adjusted.

\section*{Indications}

Azathioprine is approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis and is used at a dosage of $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. Controlled trials show efficacy in psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, polymyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and BehÃ§et's disease.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Azathioprine's toxicity includes bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal disturbances, and some increase in infection risk. As noted in Chapter 56, lymphomas may be increased with azathioprine use. Rarely, fever, rash, and hepatotoxicity signal acute allergic reactions.

\section*{MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is converted to mycophenolic acid, the active form of the drug. The active product inhibits cytosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and, secondarily, inhibits T cell lymphocyte proliferation; downstream, it interferes with leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells through inhibition of Eselectin, P -selectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

See Chapter 56.

\section*{Indications}

MMF is effective for the treatment of renal disease due to systemic lupus erythematosus and may be useful in vasculitis and Wegener's granulomatosis. While occasionally used at a dosage of $2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ to treat rheumatoid arthritis, there are no well-controlled data regarding its efficacy in this disease.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Comparisons with azathioprine in the renal transplantation literature show that MMF and azathioprine have similar gastrointestinal, hematopoietic, and hepatic toxicity profiles, with a possibly decreased incidence of fungal infections among patients treated with MMF. Hepatic toxicities are infrequent but must be monitored.

\section*{CHLOROQUINE \& HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are used mainly in malaria (see Chapter 53) and in the rheumatic diseases. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory action of these drugs in rheumatic diseases is unclear. The following mechanisms have been proposed: suppression of T lymphocyte responses to mitogens, decreased leukocyte chemotaxis, stabilization of lysosomal enzymes, inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis, and the trapping of free radicals.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Antimalarials are rapidly absorbed but only 50\% protein-bound in the plasma. They are very extensively tissue-bound, particularly in melanin-containing tissues such as the eyes. The drugs are deaminated in the liver and have blood elimination half-lives of up to 45 days.

\section*{Indications}

Antimalarials are approved for rheumatoid arthritis, but they are not considered very efficacious DMARDs. Dose-response and serum concentration-response relationships have been documented for hydroxychloroquine and dose-loading may increase rate of response. While antimalarials improve symptoms, there is no evidence that these compounds alter bony damage in rheumatoid arthritis at their usual dosages (up to $6.4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ hydroxychloroquine or $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ chloroquine). It usually takes 3-6 months to obtain a response. Antimalarials are often used for the treatment of the skin manifestations, serositis, and joint pains of systemic lupus erythematosus, and they have been used in SjÃ¶gren's syndrome.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Although ocular toxicity (Chapter 53) may occur at dosages greater than $250 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ for chloroquine and greater than $6.4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ for hydroxychloroquine, it rarely occurs at lower doses. Nevertheless, ophthalmologic monitoring every 6-12 months is advised. Other toxicities include dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rashes, and nightmares. These drugs appear to be relatively safe in pregnancy.

\section*{GOLD}

Gold compounds were first proved to be effective in a large double-blind trial in 1960. Because of their toxicity, they are used infrequently today. Their intramuscular formulations (aurothiomalate and aurothioglucose) contain 50\% elemental gold. The oral formulation (auranofin) contains 29\% elemental gold.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Gold alters the morphology and functional capabilities of human macrophages-possibly its major mode of action. As a result, monocyte chemotactic factor-1, interleukin-8, interleukin-1B production, and vascular endothelial growth factor are all inhibited. Intramuscular gold compounds also alter lysosomal enzyme activity, reduce histamine release from mast cells, inactivate the first component of complement, and suppress the phagocytic activities of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Oral gold (auranofin) also inhibits release of prostaglandin $\mathrm{E}_{2}$ and leukotriene $\mathrm{B}_{4}$.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

These compounds have high bioavailability after intramuscular administration and tend to concentrate in synovial membranes, liver, kidney, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. One month after an intramuscular injection, 75-80\% of the drug is eliminated from the serum, but intramuscular gold's total body half-life is approximately 1 year. Auranofin is only about $25 \%$ bioavailable. Gold compounds are excreted approximately $66 \%$ in the urine and $33 \%$ via the feces. No correlation has been found between serum gold concentration and either efficacy or toxicity.

\section*{Indications}

Gold is effective for active rheumatoid arthritis and has been shown to slow radiologic progression of the
disease. It has also been used in SjÃ¶gren's syndrome and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, while use in psoriatic arthritis is controversial. In Japan, gold is used to treat asthma. The oral form of gold is effective in rheumatoid arthritis, but it appears less effective than the intramuscular formulation and is generally felt to have only modest effects.

\section*{Clinical Use}

Intramuscular gold is given as a test dose of $5-25 \mathrm{mg}$ and then as 50 mg intramuscular doses weekly for 20 weeks. Continued treatment, with maintained response, frequently allows lengthening of the dosing interval to 2,3 , or 4 weeks. Oral gold is generally given as 6 mg doses daily.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Pruritic skin rashes occur in 15-20\% of patients, sometimes associated with eosinophilia. Stomatitis and a metallic taste in the mouth are common. Hematologic abnormalities, including thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and even pancytopenia occur in 1-10\% of patients. Aplastic anemia, while very rare, may be fatal. Eight to 10 percent of patients develop proteinuria that may progress to nephrotic syndrome. Rare toxicities include enterocolitis, cholestatic jaundice, peripheral neuropathy, and pulmonary infiltrates. Corneal gold deposition occurs but has little clinical import. Nitritoid reactions (sweating, flushing, and headaches) can occur, especially with gold thiomalate, and are presumably due to the vehicle rather than the gold salts. Adverse effects cause $30-40 \%$ of patients to discontinue gold therapy within a year.

\section*{PENI CI LLAMI NE}

Penicillamine, a metabolite of penicillin, is an analog of the amino acid cystine. The D isomer has been used in rheumatoid arthritis. Penicillamine is rarely used today because of toxicity.

\section*{SULFASALAZI NE}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Sulfasalazine is metabolized to sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid, and it is thought that the sulfapyridine is probably the active moiety when treating rheumatoid arthritis (unlike inflammatory bowel disease; see Chapter 63). Some authorities believe that the parent compound, sulfasalazine, also has an effect. In treated arthritis patients, IgA and IgM rheumatoid factor production are decreased. Suppression of T cell responses to concanavalin and inhibition of in vitro B cell proliferation have also been documented. It is not clear how these findings relate to the clinical efficacy of sulfasalazine in rheumatoid arthritis.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Only 10-20\% of orally administered sulfasalazine is absorbed, although a fraction undergoes enterohepatic recirculation into the bowel, where sulfasalazine is reduced by intestinal bacteria to liberate sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid. Sulfapyridine is well absorbed while 5-aminosalicylic acid remains unabsorbed. Some sulfasalazine is excreted unchanged in the urine whereas sulfapyridine is excreted after hepatic acetylation and hydroxylation. Sulfasalazine's half-life is 6-17 hours.

\section*{Indications}

Sulfasalazine is effective in rheumatoid arthritis and reduces radiologic disease progression. It has been used in juvenile chronic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and its associated uveitis. The usual regimen is $2-3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Approximately $30 \%$ of patients using sulfasalazine discontinue the drug because of toxicity. Common adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, headache, and rash. Hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia also occur, but rarely. Neutropenia occurs in 1.4-4.4\% of patients, while thrombocytopenia is very rare. Pulmonary toxicity and positive double-stranded DNA are occasionally seen, but drug-induced lupus is rare. Reversible infertility occurs in men, but sulfasalazine does not affect fertility in women. The drug does not appear to be teratogenic.

\section*{TNF- BLOCKI NG AGENTS}

Cytokines play a central role in the immune response (see Chapter 56) and in rheumatoid arthritis. Although a wide range of cytokines are expressed in the joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients, TNF-[: appears to be at the heart of the inflammatory process.

TNF-Q affects cellular function via activation of specific membrane-bound TNF receptors (TNFR ${ }_{1}$, TNFR ${ }_{2}$ ). Administered soluble TNF receptors, by combining with soluble TNF-a, can inhibit the effects of the endogenous cytokine. Monoclonal anti-TNF antibodies can, in theory, cross-link TNF receptors on the cell surface and inhibit T cell and macrophage function. Three drugs interfering with TNF-ave have been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic diseases.

\section*{Adalimumab}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Adalimumab is a fully human IgG $_{1}$ anti-TNF monoclonal antibody. This compound complexes with soluble TNF-2. and prevents its interaction with p55 and p75 cell surface receptors. This results in down-regulation of macrophage and T cell function.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Adalimumab is given subcutaneously and has a half-life of 10-20 days. Its clearance is decreased by more than $40 \%$ in the presence of methotrexate, and the formation of human antimonoclonal antibody is decreased when methotrexate is given at the same time.

\section*{Indications}

The compound is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis. It decreases the rate of formation of new erosions. It is effective both as monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate and other DMARDs. The usual dose is 40 mg every other week, although increased responses may be evident at higher dosages. Adalimumab is presently being tested in psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, and juvenile chronic arthritis.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

In common with the other TNF-a blocking agents, the risk of macrophage-dependent infection (including tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections) is increased, although it remains very low. Patients should be screened for latent or active tuberculosis before starting adalimumab or other TNF-a blocking agents. There is no evidence of an increased incidence of solid malignancies. It is not clear if the incidence of lymphomas is increased by adalimumab. A low incidence of newly formed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies and antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) has been documented when using adalimumab, but clinical lupus is extremely rare. Rare leukopenias and vasculitis, apparently associated with adalimumab, have been documented.

\section*{Infliximab}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Infliximab is a chimeric ( $25 \%$ mouse, $75 \%$ human) IgG ${ }_{1}$ monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to soluble and possibly membrane-bound TNF-a. Its mechanism of action probably is the same as that of adalimumab.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Infliximab is given as an intravenous infusion at doses ranging from $3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ to $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, although the usual dose is $3-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ every 8 weeks. There is a relationship between serum concentration and effect, although individual clearances vary markedly. The terminal half-life is $9-12$ days without accumulation after repeated dosing at the recommended interval of 8 weeks. After intermittent therapy, infliximab elicits human antichimeric antibodies in up to $62 \%$ of patients. Concurrent therapy with methotrexate markedly decreases the prevalence of human antichimeric antibodies.

\section*{Indications}

Infliximab is approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, and psoriatic arthritis. It is being used in other diseases, including psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, juvenile chronic arthritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, giant cell arteritis, and sarcoidosis. In rheumatoid arthritis, a regimen of infliximab plus methotrexate decreases the rate of formation of new erosions more than methotrexate alone over 52-104 weeks. While it is recommended that methotrexate be used in conjunction with infliximab, a number of other DMARDs, including antimalarials, azathioprine, and cyclosporine, can be used as background therapy for this drug.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, headache, sinusitis, rash, and cough are common when using infliximab, although their incidence does not appear to be very different from that of methotrexate. As a potent macrophage inhibitor, infliximab can be associated with activation of latent tuberculosis, and patients should be screened for latent or active tuberculosis before starting therapy. Other opportunistic infections have been documented, although rarely. There is no evidence for an increased incidence of solid malignancies and it is not clear if the incidence of lymphoma is increased with infliximab. Because rare demyelinating syndromes have been reported, patients with multiple sclerosis should not use infliximab. Rare cases of leukopenia, hepatitis, activation of hepatitis B, and vasculitis have been documented. The incidence of positive ANA and dsDNA antibodies is increased, although clinical lupus erythematosus remains an extremely rare occurrence and the presence of ANA and dsDNA does not contraindicate the use of infliximab. Infusion site reactions correlate with anti-infliximab antibodies. These reactions occur in approximately $3-11 \%$ of patients, and the combined use of antihistamines and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ blocking agents apparently prevents some of these reactions.

\section*{Etanercept}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Etanercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of two soluble TNF p75 receptor moieties linked to the Fc portion of human IgG ${ }_{1}$; it binds TNF-a. molecules and also inhibits lymphotoxin-a.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Etanercept is given subcutaneously in a dosage of 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg weekly. The drug is slowly absorbed, with peak concentration 72 hours after drug administration. Etanercept has a mean serum elimination half-life of 4.5 days. Fifty milligrams given once weekly gives the same area under the curve and minimum serum concentrations as 25 mg twice weekly.

\section*{Indications}

Etanercept is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile chronic arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. It is used both as monotherapy and with methotrexate background; over 70\% of patients taking etanercept are also using methotrexate. Etanercept decreases the rate of formation of new erosions relative to methotrexate alone. While etanercept is ineffective for treatment of Crohn's disease, it is being used in many rheumatic syndromes such as scleroderma, Wegener's granulomatosis, giant cell arteritis, and sarcoidosis.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

The incidence of activation of latent tuberculosis in patients treated with etanercept is numerically but not statistically lower than other TNF-blocking agents and tuberculosis screening is appropriate before starting this medication. Similarly, opportunistic infections can rarely occur when using etanercept. The incidence of solid malignancies is not increased, but as with other TNF-blocking agents one must be alert for lymphomas (although their incidence may not be increased compared with other DMARDs or active rheumatoid arthritis itself). While positive ANAs and dsDNAs may be found in patients receiving this drug, these findings do not contraindicate continued use if clinical lupus symptoms do not occur. Injection site reactions occur in 20-40\% of patients, although they rarely result in discontinuation of therapy. Antietanercept antibodies are present in up to $16 \%$ of treated patients, but they do not interfere with efficacy or predict toxicity.

\section*{ABATACEPT}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Abatacept is a costimulation modulator that inhibits the activation of T cells (see also Chapter 56). After a T cell has engaged an antigen-presenting cell (APC) a signal is produced by CD28 on the T cell that interacts with CD80 or CD86 on the APC, leading to activation. Abatacept (which contains the endogenous ligand CTLA-4) binds to CD80 and 86, thereby inhibiting the binding to CD28 and preventing the activation of T cells.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Abatacept is given as an intravenous infusion in three initial doses (day 0, week 2, and week 4), followed by monthly infusions. The dose is based on body weight, with patients weighing less than 60 kg receiving 500 mg , those $60-100 \mathrm{~kg}$ receiving 750 mg , and those more than 100 kg receiving 1000 mg . The terminal serum half-life is 13-16 days. Coadministration with methotrexate, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids does not influence abatacept clearance.

\section*{Indications}

Abatacept can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other DMARDs in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to DMARDs or TNF antagonists. It reduces the clinical signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, including slowing of radiographic progression.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

There is an increased risk of infection, predominately of the upper respiratory tract. Concomitant use with TNF antagonists is not recommended due to the increased incidence of infection with this combination. Infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported but the incidence is rare. Antiabatacept antibody formation is low ( $<5 \%$ ) and has no effect on clinical outcomes. The incidence of malignancies is similar to placebo with the exception of a possible increase in lymphomas and lung cancer (not statistically significant). The role of abatacept in this increase is unknown.

\section*{RITUXI MAB}

Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets CD20 B lymphocytes (see Chapter 56). It has shown benefit in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis refractory to antiTNF agents. Rituximab has been approved for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis when combined with methotrexate. It is given as two IV infusions 2 weeks apart.

\section*{LEFLUNOMI DE}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Leflunomide undergoes rapid conversion, both in the intestine and in the plasma, to its active metabolite, A77-1726. This metabolite inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, leading to a decrease in ribonucleotide synthesis and the arrest of stimulated cells in the $G_{1}$ phase of cell growth. Consequently, leflunomide inhibits T cell proliferation and production of autoantibodies by B cells. Secondary effects include increases of interleukin-10 receptor mRNA, decreased interleukin-8 receptor type A mRNA, and decreased TNF-a. - dependent NF-kB activation.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Leflunomide is completely absorbed and has a mean plasma half-life of 19 days. A77-1726 is subject to enterohepatic recirculation and is efficiently reabsorbed. Cholestyramine can enhance leflunomide excretion and increases total clearance by approximately $50 \%$.

\section*{Indications}

Leflunomide is as effective as methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis, including inhibition of bony damage. In one study, combined treatment with methotrexate and leflunomide resulted in a $46.2 \%$ ACR20 response compared with $19.5 \%$ in patients receiving methotrexate alone.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Diarrhea or loose bowels occur in approximately $25 \%$ of patients given leflunomide, although only about $3-5 \%$ discontinue the drug because of this effect. Elevation in liver enzymes also occurs. Both effects can be reduced by decreasing the dose of leflunomide. Other adverse effects associated with leflunomide are mild alopecia, weight gain, and increased blood pressure. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occur rarely. This drug is contraindicated in pregnancy.

\section*{COMBI NATION THERAPY WITH DMARDS}

In a 1998 study, approximately half of North American rheumatologists treated moderately aggressive rheumatoid arthritis with combination therapy, and the use of drug combinations is anticipated to be much higher now. Combinations of DMARDs can be designed rationally on the basis of complementary mechanisms of action, nonoverlapping pharmacokinetics, and nonoverlapping toxicity.

When added to methotrexate background therapy, cyclosporine, chloroquine, leflunomide, infliximab, adalimumab, rituximab, and etanercept have all shown improved efficacy. In contrast, azathioprine, auranofin, or sulfasalazine plus methotrexate results in no additional therapeutic benefit. Other combinations have occasionally been used, including the combination of intramuscular gold with hydroxychloroquine.

While it might be anticipated that combination therapy might result in more toxicity, this is often not the case. Combination therapy for patients not responding adequately to monotherapy is becoming the rule in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

\section*{I mmunoabsorption Apheresis}

Extracorporeal immunoabsorption of plasma over columns containing an inert silica matrix and covalently attached highly purified staphylococcal protein A (Prosorba column) involves apheresis of about 1200 mL plasma weekly for 3 months.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Although this treatment has been available for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura for several years, its mechanism of action is not understood. Removal of IgG and IgG-containing immune complexes does not explain its effects in rheumatoid arthritis. The most recent hypothesis for this treatment's mechanism of action is down-regulation of B cell function through the release of small amounts of staphylococcal protein A complexed with immunoglobulins.

\section*{Indications}

This treatment has been used in patients who have failed numerous other therapies, so its low efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis is better than it appears. The study establishing efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis showed a 41.7\% ACR20 response among Prosorba-treated patients compared with 15.6\% in the sham-treated group.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Common adverse events include joint pain, joint swelling, and hypotension. Central intravenous line usage may be associated with pulmonary emboli and sepsis. Other events, such as nausea, rash, pruritus, flushing, and fever, occurred in 1-6\% of treatments in both sham and treatment groups in the double-blind trial. Rare leukocytoclastic vasculitis has been documented.

\section*{Glucocorticoid Drugs}

The general pharmacology of corticosteroids, including mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and other applications, is discussed in Chapter 39.

\section*{Indications}

Corticosteroids have been used in 60-70\% of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Their effects are prompt and dramatic, and they are capable of slowing the appearance of new bone erosions. Corticosteroids may be administered for certain serious extra-articular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis such as pericarditis or eye involvement or during periods of exacerbation. When prednisone is required for long-term therapy, the dosage should not exceed 7.5 mg daily, and gradual reduction of the dose should be encouraged. Alternate-day corticosteroid therapy is usually unsuccessful in rheumatoid arthritis.

Other rheumatic diseases in which the corticosteroids' potent anti-inflammatory effects may be useful include vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's granulomatosis, psoriatic arthritis, giant cell arteritis, sarcoidosis, and gout.

Intra-articular corticosteroids are often helpful to alleviate painful symptoms and, when successful, are preferable to increasing the dosage of systemic medication.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Prolonged use of these drugs leads to serious and disabling toxic effects as described in Chapter 39. There is controversy over whether many of these side effects occur at doses below 7.5 mg prednisone equivalent daily, although many experts believe that even $3-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ can cause these effects in susceptible individuals.

\section*{Dietary Manipulation of Inflammation}

Arachidonic acid is an eicosatetraenoic acid that is metabolized by the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, yielding several mediators (see Chapter 18). These mediators have potent effects on many systems, including the immune system. It has been demonstrated that dietary manipulation that substitutes unsaturated fatty acids (such as eicosapentaenoic acid, found in marine fish) causes the alternative fatty acids to be metabolized, changing the final prostaglandin and leukotriene products of the process. The products of eicosapentaenoic acid metabolism are less potent than the corresponding mediators derived from arachidonic acid (sometimes by several orders of magnitude), and they diminish the activities of the eicosatetraenoic mediators by competing with them for shared target-cell receptors.

The results of clinical studies suggest that therapy with dietary eicosapentaenoic acid decreases both morning stiffness and the number of tender joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and erythema associated with psoriasis. The efficacy of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid approximates that of the NSAIDs. These preliminary results and the near absence of significant adverse effects suggest that dietary alteration or supplementation to provide $2-4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ of eicosapentaenoic acid may be a beneficial addition to conventional treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

\section*{OTHER ANALGESI CS}

Acetaminophen is one of the most important drugs used for the treatment of mild to moderate pain when an anti-inflammatory effect is not necessary. Phenacetin, a prodrug that is metabolized to acetaminophen, is more toxic than its active metabolite and has no rational indications.

\section*{ACETAMI NOPHEN}

Acetaminophen is the active metabolite of phenacetin and is responsible for its analgesic effect. It is a weak COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor in peripheral tissues and possesses no significant anti-inflammatory effects. Recent evidence suggests that acetaminophen may inhibit a third enzyme, COX-3, in the central nervous system. COX-3 appears to be a splice variant product of the COX-1 gene.

$N$-Acetyl- $p$-aminophenol (acetaminophen)

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Acetaminophen is administered orally. Absorption is related to the rate of gastric emptying, and peak blood concentrations are usually reached in 30-60 minutes. Acetaminophen is slightly bound to plasma proteins and is partially metabolized by hepatic microsomal enzymes and converted to acetaminophen sulfate and glucuronide, which are pharmacologically inactive (see Figure 4-4). Less than 5\% is excreted unchanged. A minor but highly active metabolite ( N -acetyl- p -benzoquinone) is important in large doses because it is toxic to both liver and kidney. The half-life of acetaminophen is $2-3$ hours and is relatively unaffected by renal function. With toxic doses or liver disease, the half-life may be increased twofold or more.

\section*{Indications}

Although equivalent to aspirin as an effective analgesic and antipyretic agent, acetaminophen differs in that it lacks anti-inflammatory properties. It does not affect uric acid levels and lacks platelet-inhibiting properties. The drug is useful in mild to moderate pain such as headache, myalgia, postpartum pain, and other circumstances in which aspirin is an effective analgesic. Acetaminophen alone is inadequate therapy for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, although it may be used as an analgesic adjunct to anti-inflammatory therapy. For mild analgesia, acetaminophen is the preferred drug in patients allergic to aspirin or when salicylates are poorly tolerated. It is preferable to aspirin in patients with hemophilia or a history of peptic ulcer and in those in whom bronchospasm is precipitated by aspirin. Unlike aspirin, acetaminophen does not antagonize the effects of uricosuric agents; it may be used concomitantly with probenecid in the treatment of gout. It is preferred to aspirin in children with viral infections.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

In therapeutic doses, a mild increase in hepatic enzymes may occasionally occur in the absence of jaundice; this is reversible when the drug is withdrawn. With larger doses, dizziness, excitement, and disorientation are seen. Ingestion of 15 g of acetaminophen may be fatal, death being caused by severe hepatotoxicity with centrilobular necrosis, sometimes associated with acute renal tubular necrosis (see Chapters 4 and 59). Doses greater than $4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ are not recommended and a history of alcoholism contraindicates even this dose. Early symptoms of hepatic damage include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Cases of renal damage without hepatic damage have occurred, even after usual doses of acetaminophen. Therapy is much less satisfactory than for aspirin overdose. In addition to supportive therapy, the measure that has proved most useful is the provision of sulfhydryl groups in the form of acetylcysteine to neutralize the toxic metabolites (see Chapter 59).

Hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia are very rare. Interstitial nephritis and papillary necrosis-serious complications of phenacetin-have not occurred nor has gastrointestinal bleeding. Caution is necessary in patients with any type of liver disease.

\section*{Dosage}

Acute pain and fever may be effectively treated with $325-500 \mathrm{mg}$ four times daily and proportionately less for children.

\section*{PHENACETIN}

Phenacetin is no longer prescribed in the USA and has been removed from many over-the-counter analgesic combinations. However, it is still present in several proprietary analgesics in this country and is in common use in many other parts of the world. The association between the excessive use of analgesic combinations-especially those that contain phenacetin-and the development of renal failure has been recognized for almost 30 years.

\section*{DRUGS USED IN GOUT}

Gout is a metabolic disease characterized by recurrent episodes of acute arthritis due to deposits of monosodium urate in joints and cartilage. Uric acid renal calculi, tophi, and interstitial nephritis may also occur. Gout is usually associated with high serum levels of uric acid, a poorly soluble substance that is the major end product of purine metabolism. In most mammals, uricase converts uric acid to the more soluble allantoin; this enzyme is absent in humans.

The treatment of gout aims to relieve acute gouty attacks and to prevent recurrent gouty episodes and urate lithiasis. Therapy for an attack of acute gouty arthritis is based on our current understanding of the pathophysiologic events that occur in this disease (Figure 36-4). Urate crystals are initially phagocytosed by synoviocytes, which then release prostaglandins, lysosomal enzymes, and interleukin-1. Attracted by these chemotactic mediators, polymorphonuclear leukocytes migrate into the joint space and amplify the ongoing inflammatory process. In the later phases of the attack, increased numbers of mononuclear phagocytes (macrophages) appear, ingest the urate crystals, and release more inflammatory mediators. This sequence of events suggests that the most effective agents for the management of acute urate crystal-induced inflammation are those that suppress different phases of leukocyte activation.
Figure 36-4.

Pathophysiologic events in a gouty joint. Synoviocytes phagocytose urate crystals and then secrete inflammatory mediators, which attract and activate polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and mononuclear phagocytes (MNP)
(macrophages). Drugs active in gout inhibit crystal phagocytosis and polymorphonuclear leukocyte and macrophage release of inflammatory mediators. (PG, prostaglandin; IL-1, interleukin-1; LTB ${ }_{4}$, leukotriene $\mathrm{B}_{4}$.)

Before starting chronic therapy for gout, patients in whom hyperuricemia is associated with gout and urate lithiasis must be clearly distinguished from those who have only hyperuricemia. In an asymptomatic person with hyperuricemia, the efficacy of long-term drug treatment is unproved. In some individuals, uric acid levels may be elevated up to 2 standard deviations above the mean for a lifetime without adverse consequences.

\section*{COLCHI CI NE}

Although NSAIDs are now the first-line drugs for acute gout, colchicine was the primary treatment for many years. Colchicine is an alkaloid isolated from the autumn crocus, Colchicum autumnale. Its structure is shown in Figure 36-5.

\section*{Sulfinpyrazone}

Copyright Â©2006 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.
Colchicine and uricosuric drugs.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Colchicine is absorbed readily after oral administration, reaches peak plasma levels within 2 hours, and is eliminated with a serum half-life of 9 hours. Metabolites are excreted in the intestinal tract and urine.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Colchicine relieves the pain and inflammation of gouty arthritis in 12-24 hours without altering the metabolism or excretion of urates and without other analgesic effects. Colchicine produces its antiinflammatory effects by binding to the intracellular protein tubulin, thereby preventing its polymerization into microtubules and leading to the inhibition of leukocyte migration and phagocytosis. It also inhibits the formation of leukotriene $\mathrm{B}_{4}$. Several of colchicine's adverse effects are produced by its inhibition of tubulin polymerization and cell mitosis.

\section*{Indications}

Although colchicine is more specific in gout than the NSAIDs, NSAIDs (eg, indomethacin and other NSAIDs [except aspirin]) have replaced it in the treatment of acute gout because of the troublesome diarrhea associated with colchicine therapy. Colchicine is now used for the prophylaxis of recurrent episodes of gouty arthritis, is effective in preventing attacks of acute Mediterranean fever, and may have a mild beneficial effect in sarcoid arthritis and in hepatic cirrhosis. Although it can be given intravenously, this route should be used cautiously because of increased bone marrow toxicity.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Colchicine often causes diarrhea and may occasionally cause nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Colchicine may rarely cause hair loss and bone marrow depression as well as peripheral neuritis and myopathy.

Acute intoxication after overdoses is characterized by burning throat pain, bloody diarrhea, shock, hematuria, and oliguria. Fatal ascending central nervous system depression has been reported. Treatment is supportive.

\section*{Dosage}

In prophylaxis (the most common use), the dose of colchicine is 0.6 mg one to three times daily. For terminating an attack of gout, the traditional initial dose of colchicine is usually 0.6 or 1.2 mg , followed by 0.6 mg every 2 hours until pain is relieved or nausea and diarrhea appear. The total dose can be given intravenously if necessary, but it should be remembered that as little as 8 mg in 24 hours may be fatal.

\section*{NSAI DS IN GOUT}

In addition to inhibiting prostaglandin synthase, indomethacin and other NSAIDs also inhibit urate crystal phagocytosis. Indomethacin is commonly used as initial treatment of gout as the replacement for colchicine. For acute gout 50 mg three times daily is given; when a response occurs, the dosage is reduced to 25 mg three times daily for 5-7 days.

All other NSAIDs except aspirin, salicylates, and tolmetin have been successfully used to treat acute gouty episodes. Oxaprozin, which lowers serum uric acid, is theoretically a good choice although it should not be given to patients with uric acid stones because it increases uric acid excretion in the urine. These agents appear to be as effective and safe as the older drugs.

\section*{URI COSURI C AGENTS}

Probenecid and sulfinpyrazone are uricosuric drugs employed to decrease the body pool of urate in patients with tophaceous gout or in those with increasingly frequent gouty attacks. In a patient who excretes large amounts of uric acid, the uricosuric agents should not be used.

\section*{Chemistry}

Uricosuric drugs are organic acids (Figure 36-5) and, as such, act at the anionic transport sites of the renal tubule (see Chapter 15). Sulfinpyrazone is a metabolite of an analog of phenylbutazone.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Probenecid is completely reabsorbed by the renal tubules and is metabolized slowly with a terminal serum half-life of 5-8 hours. Sulfinpyrazone or its active hydroxylated derivative is rapidly excreted by the
kidneys. Even so, the duration of its effect after oral administration is almost as long as that of probenecid, which is given once or twice daily.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Uric acid is freely filtered at the glomerulus. Like many other weak acids, it is also both reabsorbed and secreted in the middle segment $\left(\mathrm{S}_{2}\right)$ of the proximal tubule. Uricosuric drugsâprobenecid, sulfinpyrazone, and large doses of aspirin-affect these active transport sites so that net reabsorption of uric acid in the proximal tubule is decreased. Because aspirin in doses of less than 2.6 g daily causes net retention of uric acid by inhibiting the secretory transporter, it should not be used for analgesia in patients with gout. The secretion of other weak acids (eg, penicillin) is also reduced by uricosuric agents. Probenecid was originally developed to prolong penicillin blood levels.

As the urinary excretion of uric acid increases, the size of the urate pool decreases, although the plasma concentration may not be greatly reduced. In patients who respond favorably, tophaceous deposits of urate are reabsorbed, with relief of arthritis and remineralization of bone. With the ensuing increase in uric acid excretion, a predisposition to the formation of renal stones is augmented rather than decreased; therefore, the urine volume should be maintained at a high level, and at least early in treatment the urine pH should be kept above 6.0 by the administration of alkali.

\section*{Indications}

Uricosuric therapy should be initiated in gouty underexcretion of uric acid when allopurinol or febuxostat is contraindicated or when evidence of tophi appears. Therapy should not be started until 2-3 weeks after an acute attack.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Adverse effects do not provide a basis for preferring one or the other of the uricosuric agents. Both of these organic acids cause gastrointestinal irritation, but sulfinpyrazone is more active in this regard. A rash may appear after the use of either compound. Nephrotic syndrome has occurred after the use of probenecid. Both sulfinpyrazone and probenecid may rarely cause aplastic anemia.

\section*{Contraindications \& Cautions}

It is essential to maintain a large urine volume to minimize the possibility of stone formation.

\section*{Dosage}

Probenecid is usually started at a dosage of 0.5 g orally daily in divided doses, progressing to 1 g daily after 1 week. Sulfinpyrazone is started at a dosage of 200 mg orally daily, progressing to $400-800 \mathrm{mg}$ daily. It should be given in divided doses with food to reduce adverse gastrointestinal effects.

\section*{ALLOPURI NOL}

The preferred and standard-of-care therapy for gout is allopurinol, which reduces total uric acid body burden by inhibiting xanthine oxidase.

\section*{Chemistry}

The structure of allopurinol, an isomer of hypoxanthine, is shown in Figure 36-6.

Allopurinol is approximately $80 \%$ absorbed after oral administration and has a terminal serum half-life of 1-2 hours. Like uric acid, allopurinol is itself metabolized by xanthine oxidase, but the resulting compound, alloxanthine, retains the capacity to inhibit xanthine oxidase and has a long enough duration of action so that allopurinol is given only once a day.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Dietary purines are not an important source of uric acid. Quantitatively important amounts of purine are formed from amino acids, formate, and carbon dioxide in the body. Those purine ribonucleotides not incorporated into nucleic acids and derived from nucleic acid degradation are converted to xanthine or hypoxanthine and oxidized to uric acid (Figure 36-6). Allopurinol inhibits this last step, resulting in a fall in the plasma urate level and a decrease in the size of the urate pool. The more soluble xanthine and hypoxanthine are increased.

\section*{Indications}

Treatment of gout with allopurinol, as with uricosuric agents, is begun with the expectation that it will be continued for years if not for life. Allopurinol is often the first urate-lowering drug used. When starting allopurinol, colchicine should also be used until steady-state serum uric acid is normalized or decreased to less than $6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Thereafter colchicine can be stopped, while allopurinol is continued. Aside from gout, allopurinol is used as an antiprotozoal agent (see Chapter 52) and is indicated to prevent the massive uricosuria following therapy of blood dyscrasias that could otherwise lead to renal calculi.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

See above for protection against an acute attack during the initial use of allopurinol. Gastrointestinal
intolerance, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, may occur. Peripheral neuritis and necrotizing vasculitis, depression of bone marrow elements, and, rarely, aplastic anemia may also occur. Hepatic toxicity and interstitial nephritis have been reported. An allergic skin reaction characterized by pruritic maculopapular lesions occurs in 3\% of patients. Isolated cases of exfoliative dermatitis have been reported. In very rare cases, allopurinol has become bound to the lens, resulting in cataracts.

\section*{Interactions \& Cautions}

When chemotherapeutic mercaptopurines (eg, azathioprine) are given concomitantly with allopurinol, their dosage must be reduced by about $75 \%$. Allopurinol may also increase the effect of cyclophosphamide. Allopurinol inhibits the metabolism of probenecid and oral anticoagulants and may increase hepatic iron concentration. Safety in children and during pregnancy has not been established.

\section*{Dosage}

The initial dosage of allopurinol is $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. It may be titrated upward until serum uric acid is below 6 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$; this level is commonly achieved at $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ but is not restricted to this dose.

Colchicine or an NSAID should be given during the first weeks of allopurinol therapy to prevent the gouty arthritis episodes that sometimes occur.

\section*{FEBUXOSTAT}

Febuxostat is the first nonpurine inhibitor of xanthine oxidase.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Febuxostat is more than $80 \%$ absorbed following oral administration. Maximum concentration is reached in approximately 1 hour. Febuxostat is extensively metabolized in the liver. All of the drug and its metabolites appear in the urine although less than $5 \%$ appears as unchanged drug. Because it is highly metabolized to inactive metabolites, no dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Febuxostat is a potent and selective inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, and thereby reduces the formation of xanthine and uric acid. No other enzymes involved in purine or pyrimidine metabolism are inhibited. Febuxostat at a daily dose of 80 mg or 120 mg was more effective than allopurinol at a standard 300 mg daily dose in lowering serum urate levels. The urate-lowering effect was comparable regardless of the pathogenic cause of hyperuricemia-overproduction or underexcretion.

\section*{Indications}

Febuxostat is awaiting FDA approval at its 80 mg and 120 mg dose for the treatment of chronic gout. It is the first new drug for the treatment of gout in over 40 years.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

As with allopurinol, prophylactic treatment with colchicine or NSAIDs should start at the beginning of treatment to avoid gout flares. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events are liver function abnormalities, diarrhea, headache, and nausea. Febuxostat appears to be well tolerated in patients with a history of allopurinol intolerance.

\section*{HYPOTHALAMI C \& PITUITARY HORMONES: INTRODUCTI ON}

The control of metabolism, growth, and reproduction is mediated by a combination of neural and endocrine systems located in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. The pituitary weighs about 0.6 g and rests at the base of the brain in the bony sella turcica near the optic chiasm and the cavernous sinuses. The pituitary consists of an anterior lobe (adenohypophysis) and a posterior lobe (neurohypophysis) (Figure 37-1). It is connected to the overlying hypothalamus by a stalk of neurosecretory fibers and blood vessels, including a portal venous system that drains the hypothalamus and perfuses the anterior pituitary. The portal venous system carries small regulatory hormones (Figure 37-1, Table 37-1) from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary.

Figure 37-1.

The hypothalamic-pituitary endocrine system. Except for prolactin, hormones released from the anterior pituitary stimulate the production of hormones by a peripheral endocrine gland or the liver. Prolactin and the hormones released from the posterior pituitary (vasopressin and oxytocin) act directly on target tissues. Hypothalamic factors regulate the release of anterior pituitary hormones.

${ }^{1}$ All of these hormones act through G protein-coupled receptors except growth hormone and prolactin, which act through JAK/STAT receptors.
${ }^{2}$ Endogenous GnRH, which is released in pulses, stimulates LH and FSH release. When administered continuously as a drug, GnRH and its analogs inhibit LH and FSH release.

The posterior lobe hormones are synthesized in the hypothalamus and transported via the neurosecretory fibers in the stalk of the pituitary to the posterior lobe, from which they are released into the circulation.

Drugs that mimic or block the effects of hypothalamic and pituitary hormones have pharmacologic applications in three primary areas: (1) as replacement therapy for hormone deficiency states; (2) as antagonists for diseases that result from excess production of pituitary hormones; and (3) as diagnostic tools for identifying several endocrine abnormalities.

\section*{ANTERIOR PITUITARY HORMONES \& THEI R HYPOTHALAMI C REGULATORS}

All of the hormones produced by the anterior pituitary except prolactin (PRL) are key participants in
hormonal systems in which they regulate the production by peripheral tissues of hormones that perform the ultimate regulatory functions. In these systems, the secretion of the pituitary hormone is under the control of a hypothalamic hormone. Each hypothalamic-pituitary-endocrine gland system or axis provides multiple opportunities for complex neuroendocrine regulation of growth, development, and reproductive functions.

\section*{Anterior Pituitary \& Hypothalamic Hormone Receptors}

The anterior pituitary hormones can be classified according to hormone structure and the types of receptors that they activate. Growth hormone and prolactin, single-chain protein hormones with significant homology, form one group. Both hormones activate receptors of the JAK/STAT superfamily (see Chapter 2). Three pituitary hormones-thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH)-are dimeric proteins that activate G protein-coupled receptors (Chapter 2). Thyroid-stimulating hormone, FSH, and LH share a common achain. Their Bchains, although somewhat similar to each other, differ enough to confer receptor specificity. Finally, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a single peptide that is cleaved from a larger precursor that also contains the peptide $B$-endorphin (see Chapter 31), represents a third category. It does, however, like TSH, LH, and FSH, act through a G protein-coupled receptor.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone, FSH, LH, and ACTH share similarities in the regulation of their release from the pituitary. All are under the control of a hypothalamic peptide that stimulates their production by acting on G protein-coupled receptors (Table 37-1). Thyroid-stimulating hormone release is regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), whereas the release of LH and FSH (known collectively as gonadotropins) is stimulated by pulses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Adrenocorticotropin release is stimulated by corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). The final important regulatory feature shared by these three structurally related hormones is that they and their hypothalamic releasing factors are subject to feedback inhibitory regulation by the hormones whose production they control. Thyroid-stimulating hormone and TRH production is inhibited by the two key thyroid hormones, thyroxine and triiodothyronine (Chapter 38). Gonadotropin and GnRH production is inhibited in women by estrogen and progesterone, and in men by androgens such as testosterone. Production of ACTH is inhibited by cortisol. Feedback regulation is critical to the physiologic control of thyroid, adrenal cortical, and gonadal function and is also very important in pharmacologic treatments that affect these systems.

The hypothalamic hormonal control of GH and prolactin differs from the regulatory system for TSH, FSH, LH, and ACTH. The hypothalamus secretes two hormones that regulate GH; growth hormonereleasing hormone (GHRH) stimulates growth hormone production, whereas the peptide somatostatin (SST) inhibits growth hormone production. Growth hormone (GH) and its primary peripheral mediator, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), also provide feedback to inhibit GH release. Prolactin production is inhibited by the catecholamine dopamine acting through the $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ subtype of dopamine receptors. The hypothalamus does not produce a hormone that stimulates prolactin production.

Whereas all of the pituitary and hypothalamic hormones described above are available for use in humans, only a few are of major clinical importance. Because of the greater ease of administration of target endocrine gland hormones or their synthetic analogs, the related hypothalamic and pituitary
hormones (TRH, TSH, CRH, ACTH, GHRH) are either not used clinically or are used rarely for specialized diagnostic testing. These agents are listed in Tables 37-2 and 37-3 and are not discussed further in this chapter. In contrast, GH, somatostatin, LH, FSH, GnRH, and dopamine or analogs of these hormones are commonly used and are described in the following text.

\section*{GROWTH HORMONE (SOMATOTROPI N)}

Growth hormone, one of the peptide hormones produced by the anterior pituitary, is required during childhood and adolescence for attainment of normal adult size and has important effects throughout postnatal life on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and on lean body mass. Its effects are primarily mediated via insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1, somatomedin C) and to a lesser extent both directly and through insulin-like growth factor $\mathbf{2 ( I G F - 2 )}$. Individuals with congenital or acquired deficiency in GH during childhood or adolescence fail to reach their predicted adult height and have disproportionately increased body fat and decreased muscle mass. Adults with GH deficiency also have disproportionately small lean body mass.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

\section*{STRUCTURE}

Growth hormone (somatotropin) is a 191-amino-acid peptide with two sulfhydryl bridges. Its structure closely resembles that of prolactin. In the past, medicinal GH was isolated from the pituitaries of human cadavers. However, this form of GH was found to be contaminated with prions that could cause Creutzfeldt-J akob disease. For this reason, it is no longer used.

Two types of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) are approved for clinical use. Somatropin has a 191-amino-acid sequence that is identical with the predominant native form of human growth hormone. Somatrem has 192 amino acids consisting of the 191 amino acids of GH plus an extra methionine residue at the amino terminal end. The two preparations appear to be equipotent.

\section*{ABSORPTION, METABOLISM, AND EXCRETION}

Circulating endogenous GH has a half-life of 20-25 minutes and is predominantly cleared by the liver. Recombinant human GH is administered subcutaneously 3-6 times per week. Peak levels occur in 2-4 hours and active blood levels persist for approximately 36 hours.

Somatropin injectable suspension is a long-acting preparation of rhGH enclosed within microspheres. These microspheres degrade slowly after subcutaneous injection such that the rhGH is released over about 1 month.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Growth hormone mediates its effects via cell surface receptors of the JAK/STAT cytokine receptor superfamily. Dimerization of two GH receptors is stimulated by a single GH molecule and activates signaling cascades mediated by receptor-associated JAK tyrosine kinases and STATs (see Chapter 2). Growth hormone has complex effects on growth, body composition, and carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism. The growth-promoting effects are mediated through an increase in the production of IGF-1. Much of the circulating IGF-1 is produced in the liver. Growth hormone also stimulates production of IGF-1 in bone, cartilage, muscle, and the kidney, where it plays autocrine or paracrine roles. Growth hormone stimulates longitudinal bone growth until the epiphyses close-near the end of puberty. In both children and adults, GH has anabolic effects in muscle and catabolic effects in lipid cells that shift the balance of body mass to an increase in muscle mass and a reduction in central
adiposity. The effects of GH on carbohydrate metabolism are mixed, in part because GH and IGF-1 have opposite effects on insulin sensitivity. Growth hormone reduces insulin sensitivity, which results in mild hyperinsulinemia. In contrast, in patients who are unable to respond to endogenous GH because of mutated GH receptors, IGF-1 acting through its own IGF-1 receptors and through insulin receptors lowers serum glucose and reduces circulating insulin.

\section*{Clinical Pharmacology}

\section*{GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY}

Growth hormone deficiency can have a genetic basis or can be acquired as a result of damage to the pituitary or hypothalamus by a tumor, infection, surgery, or radiation therapy. In childhood, GH deficiency presents as short stature and adiposity. (Neonates with isolated GH deficiency are of normal size at birth, presumably because fetal GH is not required for normal prenatal growth.) Another early sign of GH deficiency is hypoglycemia due to unopposed action of insulin, to which young children are especially sensitive. Criteria for diagnosis of GH deficiency usually include (1) a growth rate below 4 cm per year and (2) the absence of a serum GH response to two GH secretagogues. The incidence of congenital GH deficiency is approximately 1:4000 live births. Therapy with rhGH permits many children with short stature due to GH deficiency to achieve normal adult height.

In the past, it was believed that adults with GH deficiency did not exhibit a significant syndrome. However, more detailed studies suggest that adults with GH deficiency often have generalized obesity, reduced muscle mass, asthenia, and reduced cardiac output. GH-deficient adults who have been treated with GH have been shown to experience a reversal of many of these manifestations.

\section*{GROWTH HORMONE TREATMENT OF PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH SHORT STATURE}

Although the greatest improvement in growth occurs in patients with GH deficiency, exogenous GH has some effect on height in children with short stature that is due to factors other than GH deficiency. Growth hormone has been approved for several conditions (Table 37-4) and has been used experimentally or off-label in many others. Prader-Willi syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disease that is associated with growth failure, obesity, and carbohydrate intolerance. In pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome and growth failure, GH treatment decreases body fat and increases lean body mass, linear growth, and energy expenditure.

Table 37-4. Clinical Uses of Recombinant Human Growth Hormone.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Primary Therapeutic Objective & Clinical Condition \\
\hline \multirow[t]{7}{*}{Growth} & Growth failure in pediatric patients associated with: \\

\hline Increased lean body mass, weight, and physical endurance & Wasting in patients with AIDS \\

\hline
\end{tabular}

Growth hormone treatment has also been shown to have a strong beneficial effect on final height of girls with Turner syndrome, the syndrome associated with a 45, XO karyotype. In clinical trials, GH treatment has been shown to increase final height in girls with Turner syndrome by $10-15 \mathrm{~cm}$ ( $4-6$ inches). Because girls with Turner syndrome also have either absent or rudimentary ovaries, GH must be judiciously combined with gonadal steroids to achieve the maximal height effect.

Other conditions of growth failure for which GH treatment is approved include chronic renal failure in pediatric patients and small-for-gestational-age condition at birth in which the child has failed to catch up by age 2. In all of these pediatric patients as well as in patients with GH deficiency, it is critical to start GH treatment before the long bone epiphyses have closed.

The most controversial approved use of GH is for children with idiopathic short stature, also known as non-growth hormone-deficient short stature. This is a heterogeneous population that is defined clinically by a height that is 2.25 standard deviations or more below the national norm for children of the same age. Eligible children also have growth rates that are unlikely to result in an adult height in the normal range and the absence of a condition known to be associated with impaired growth. In this group of children, multiple years of GH therapy results in an average increase in adult height of $4-7 \mathrm{~cm}$ (1.57-2.76 inches) at an average cost of $\$ 35,000$ per inch of height gained. The complex issues involved in the cost-risk-benefit relationship of this use of GH are important because an estimated

400,000 children in the USA fit the diagnostic criteria for idiopathic short stature.
Treatment of children with short stature should be carried out by specialists experienced in the use of GH. Treatment is begun with $0.025 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ daily and may be increased to a maximum of $0.045 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ daily. Somatropin injectable suspension is a long-acting preparation of rhGH that is administered subcutaneously in doses of $1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ monthly or $0.75 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ twice monthly. Children must be observed closely for slowing of growth velocity, which could indicate a need to increase the dosage or the possibility of epiphyseal fusion or intercurrent problems such as hypothyroidism or malnutrition. Children with Turner syndrome or chronic renal insufficiency require somewhat higher doses.

\section*{Other Uses of Growth Hormone}

Growth hormone affects many organ systems and also has a net anabolic effect. It has been tested in a number of conditions that are associated with a severe catabolic state and is approved for the treatment of wasting in patients with AIDS. In 2004, GH was approved for treatment of patients with short bowel syndrome who are dependent on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). After intestinal resection or bypass, the remaining functional intestine in many patients undergoes extensive adaptation that allows it to adequately absorb nutrients. However, other patients fail to adequately adapt and develop a malabsorption syndrome. Growth hormone has been shown in experimental animals to increase intestinal growth and improve its function. Results of GH treatment of patients with short bowel syndrome and dependence on total parenteral nutrition have been mixed in the clinical studies that have been published to date. Growth hormone is administered with glutamine, which also has trophic effects on the intestinal mucosa.

Growth hormone is a popular component of anti-aging programs. Serum levels of GH normally decline with aging; anti-aging programs claim that injection of GH or administration of drugs purported to increase GH release are effective anti-aging remedies. These claims are largely unsubstantiated. It is interesting that a number of studies in mice and the nematode C elegans have clearly demonstrated that analogs of human GH and IGF-1 consistently shorten lifespan and that loss-of-function mutations in the signaling pathways for the GH and IGF-1 analogs lengthen life-span. Another use of GH is by athletes for a purported increase in muscle mass and athletic performance. Growth hormone is one of the drugs banned by the Olympic Committee.

In 1993, the FDA approved the use of recombinant bovine growth hormone (rbGH) in dairy cattle to increase milk production. Although milk and meat from rbGH-treated cows appear to be safe, these cows have a higher incidence of mastitis, which could increase antibiotic use and result in greater antibiotic residues in milk and meat.

\section*{Toxicity \& Contraindications}

Children generally tolerate GH treatment well. A rarely reported side effect is intracranial hypertension, which may manifest as vision changes, headache, nausea, or vomiting. Some children develop scoliosis during rapid growth. Patients with Turner syndrome have an increased risk of otitis media while taking GH. Hypothyroidism is commonly discovered during GH treatment, so periodic assessment of thyroid function is indicated. Pancreatitis, gynecomastia, and nevus growth have occurred in patients receiving GH. Adults tend to have more adverse effects from GH therapy. Peripheral edema, myalgias, and arthralgias (especially in the hands and wrists) occur commonly but remit with dosage reduction. Carpal tunnel syndrome can occur. Growth hormone treatment increases the activity of cytochrome

P450 isoforms, which could reduce the serum levels of drugs metabolized by that enzyme system (see Chapter 4). There has been no increased incidence of malignancy among patients receiving GH therapy, but GH treatment is contraindicated in a patient with a known malignancy. Proliferative retinopathy may rarely occur. Growth hormone treatment of critically ill patients appears to increase mortality.

Side effects of the long-acting somatropin injectable suspension have included injection-site nodules that persist for 5-7 days (96\%), edema, arthralgias, transient fatigue (24\%), mild-moderate nausea ( $24 \%$ ), and headache ( $36 \%$ ).

\section*{MECASERMI N}

A small number of children with growth failure have severe IGF-1 deficiency that is not responsive to exogenous GH. Causes include mutations in the GH receptor and development of neutralizing antibodies to GH. In 2005, the FDA approved mecasermin for treatment of severe IGF-1 deficiency that is not responsive to GH. Mecasermin is a complex of recombinant human IGF-1 (rhl GF-1) and recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (rhIGFBP-3). The IGF-1 activates transmembrane receptors that, like insulin and EGF receptors, manifest tyrosine kinase activity at their intracellular domains (see Chapters 2 and 41). The binding protein rhIGFBP-3 is needed to maintain an adequate half-life of rhIGF-1. Normally, over $80 \%$ of the circulating IGF-1 is bound to IGFBP-3, which is produced by the liver under the control of GH. Patients with severe IGF-1 deficiency that is secondary to aberrant GH signaling also have deficiency of IGFBP-3, and so it is important to supply this with the IGF-1 replacement. Mecasermin is administered subcutaneously twice daily at a recommended starting dosage of $0.04-0.08 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ and increased weekly up to a maximum twice-daily dosage of $0.12 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$. The most important adverse effect observed with mecasermin is hypoglycemia. To avoid hypoglycemia, the prescribing instructions require consumption of a meal or snack 20 minutes before or after mecasermin administration. Several patients have experienced intracranial hypertension and asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes.

\section*{GROWTH HORMONE ANTAGONI STS}

The need for antagonists of GH stems from the tendency of GH-producing cells (somatotrophs) in the anterior pituitary to form secreting tumors. Pituitary adenomas occur most commonly in adults. In adults, GH-secreting adenomas cause acromegaly, which is characterized by abnormal growth of cartilage and bone tissue, and many organs including skin, muscle, heart, liver, and the gastrointestinal tract. Acromegaly adversely affects the skeletal, muscular, cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic systems. When a GH-secreting adenoma occurs before the long bone epiphyses close, it leads to the rare condition, gigantism. Small GH-secreting adenomas can be treated with GH antagonists. Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, and bromocriptine, a dopamine receptor agonist (described below) reduce the production of GH, whereas pegvisomant prevents GH from activating its receptor. Larger pituitary adenomas, which produce greater amounts of GH and also can impair visual and central nervous system function by encroaching on nearby brain structures, are treated with transsphenoidal surgery or radiation.

\section*{Somatostatin \& Octreotide}

Somatostatin, a 14-amino-acid peptide (Figure 37-2), is found in the hypothalamus, other parts of the central nervous system, the pancreas, and other sites in the gastrointestinal tract. It inhibits the
release of GH, glucagon, insulin, and gastrin.
Figure 37-2.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-1113.jpg?height=730&width=1470&top_left_y=394&top_left_x=227)

Above: Amino acid sequence of somatostatin. Below: Sequence of the synthetic analog, octreotide.
Exogenous somatostatin is rapidly cleared from the circulation, with an initial half-life of 1-3 minutes. The kidney appears to play an important role in its metabolism and excretion.

Somatostatin has limited therapeutic usefulness because of its short duration of action and its multiple effects in many secretory systems. Octreotide, an analog of somatostatin (Figure 37-2), is 45 times more potent than somatostatin in inhibiting GH release but only twice as potent in reducing insulin secretion. Because of this relatively reduced effect on pancreatic B cells, hyperglycemia rarely occurs during treatment. The plasma elimination half-life of octreotide is about 80 minutes, 30 times longer in humans than that of somatostatin.

Octreotide, $50-200 \mathrm{mcg}$ given subcutaneously every 8 hours, reduces symptoms caused by a variety of hormone-secreting tumors: acromegaly; the carcinoid syndrome; gastrinoma; glucagonoma; nesidioblastosis; the watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria (WDHA) syndrome; and diabetic diarrhea. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, using radiolabeled octreotide, is useful in localizing neuroendocrine tumors having somatostatin receptors and helps predict the response to octreotide therapy. Octreotide is also useful for the acute control of bleeding from esophageal varices.

Octreotide acetate injectable long-acting suspension is a slow-release microsphere formulation. It is instituted only after a brief course of shorter-acting octreotide has been demonstrated to be effective and tolerated. Injections into alternate gluteal muscles are repeated at 4 -week intervals in doses of $20-40 \mathrm{mg}$. Octreotide is extremely costly.

Adverse effects of octreotide therapy include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, flatulence, and steatorrhea with bulky bowel movements. Biliary sludge and gallstones may occur after 6 months of use in 20-30\% of patients. However, the yearly incidence of symptomatic gallstones is about 1\%.

Cardiac effects include sinus bradycardia ( $25 \%$ ) and conduction disturbances ( $10 \%$ ). Pain at the site of injection is common, especially with the long-acting octreotide suspension. Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency may occur with long-term use of octreotide.

\section*{Pegvisomant}

Pegvisomant is a GH receptor antagonist that is useful for the treatment of acromegaly. Pegvisomant is the polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivative of a mutant GH, B2036, which has increased affinity for one site of the GH receptor but a reduced affinity at its second binding site. This allows dimerization of the receptor but blocks the conformational changes required for signal transduction. Pegvisomant is a less potent GH receptor antagonist than is B2036, but pegylation reduces its clearance and improves its overall clinical effectiveness. When pegvisomant was administered subcutaneously to 160 patients with acromegaly daily for 12 months or more, serum levels of IGF-1 fell into the normal range in 97\%; two patients experienced growth of their GH-secreting pituitary tumors, and two patients developed increases in liver enzymes.

\section*{THE GONADOTROPI NS- FOLLI CLE-STI MULATI NG HORMONE \& LUTEI NI ZI NG HORMONE-\& HUMAN CHORIONIC GONADOTROPI N}

The gonadotropins are produced by a single type of pituitary cell, the gonadotroph. These hormones serve complementary functions in the reproductive process. In women, the principal function of FSH is to direct ovarian follicle development. Both FSH and LH are needed for ovarian steroidogenesis. In the ovary, LH stimulates androgen production by theca cells in the follicular stage of the menstrual cycle, whereas FSH stimulates the conversion by granulosa cells of androgens to estrogens. In the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, estrogen and progesterone production is primarily under the control first of LH and then, if pregnancy occurs, under the control of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Human chorionic gonadotropin is a placental protein nearly identical to LH; its actions are mediated through LH receptors.

In men, FSH is the primary regulator of spermatogenesis, whereas LH is the main stimulus for the production of testosterone by Leydig cells. FSH helps to maintain high local androgen concentrations in the vicinity of developing sperm by stimulating the production of androgen-binding protein by Sertoli cells. FSH also stimulates the conversion by Sertoli cells of testosterone to estrogen.

FSH, LH, and hCG are commercially available in several different forms. They are used in states of infertility to stimulate spermatogenesis in men and to induce ovulation in women. Their most common clinical use is for the controlled ovulation hyperstimulation that is the cornerstone of assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF, see below).

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

All three hormones-FSH, LH, and hCG-are dimers that share an identical achain in addition to a distinct Bichain that confers receptor specificity. The Bchains of hCG and LH are nearly identical, and these two hormones are used interchangeably. All of the gonadotropin preparations are administered by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, usually on a daily basis. Half-lives vary by preparation and route of injection from 10 to 40 hours.

\section*{MENOTROPI NS}

The first commercial gonadotropin product was extracted from the urine of postmenopausal women,
which contains a substance with FSH-like properties (but with $4 \%$ of the potency of FSH) and an LHlike substance. This purified extract of FSH and LH is known as menotropins, or human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG).

\section*{FOLLI CLE-STI MULATI NG HORMONE}

Three forms of purified FSH are available. Urofollitropin, also known as uFSH, is a purified preparation of human FSH that is extracted from the urine of postmenopausal women. Virtually all of the LH activity has been removed through a form of immunoaffinity chromatography that uses antihCG antibodies. Two recombinant forms of FSH (rFSH) are also available: follitropin alfa and follitropin beta. The amino acid sequences of these two products are identical to that of human FSH. These preparations differ from each other and urofollitropin in the composition of the carbohydrate side chains. The rFSH preparations have a shorter half-life than preparations derived from human urine but stimulate estrogen secretion at least as efficiently and, in some studies, more efficiently. The rFSH preparations are considerably more expensive.

\section*{LUTEINIZING HORMONE}

Lutropin, recombinant human LH (rLH), was introduced in the USA in 2004. When given by subcutaneous injection, it has a half-life of about 10 hours. Lutropin has only been approved for use in combination with follitropin alfa for stimulation of follicular development in infertile women with profound LH deficiency. It has not been approved for use with the other preparations of FSH nor for simulating the endogenous LH surge that is needed to complete follicular development and precipitate ovulation.

\section*{HUMAN CHORIONIC GONADOTROPIN}

Human chorionic gonadotropin is produced by the human placenta and excreted into the urine, whence it can be extracted and purified. It is a glycoprotein consisting of a 92-amino-acid achain virtually identical to that of FSH, LH, and TSH, and a Bchain of 145 amino acids that resembles that of LH except for the presence of a carboxyl terminal sequence of 30 amino acids not present in LH. Choriogonadotropin alfa (rhCG) is a recombinant form of hCG. Because of its greater consistency in biologic activity, the rhCG is packaged and dosed on the basis of weight rather than units of activity. All of the other gonadotropins, including rFSH, are packaged and dosed on the basis of units of activity. The preparation of hCG that is purified from human urine is administered by intramuscular injection, whereas rhCG is administered by subcutaneous injection.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

The gonadotropins and hCG exert their effects through G protein-coupled receptors. LH and FSH have complex effects on reproductive tissues in both sexes. In women, these effects change over the time course of a menstrual cycle as a result of a complex interplay between concentration-dependent effects of the gonadotropins, cross-talk between LH, FSH, and gonadal steroids, and the influence of other ovarian hormones. A coordinated pattern of FSH and LH secretion during the menstrual cycle (see Figure 40-1) is required for normal follicle development, ovulation, and pregnancy.

During the first 8 weeks of pregnancy, the progesterone and estrogen required to maintain pregnancy are produced by the ovarian corpus luteum. For the first few days after ovulation, the corpus luteum is maintained by maternal LH. However, as maternal LH concentrations fall owing to increasing concentrations of progesterone and estrogen, maintenance of the corpus luteum must be taken over
by hCG produced by the placenta.

\section*{Clinical Pharmacology OVULATION INDUCTION}

The gonadotropins are used to induce ovulation in women with anovulation due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, polycystic ovary syndrome, obesity, and other causes. Because of the high cost of gonadotropins and the need for close monitoring during their administration, gonadotropins are generally reserved for anovulatory women who fail to respond to other less complicated forms of treatment (eg, clomiphene, aromatase inhibitors, metformin; see Chapter 40). Gonadotropins are also used for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in assisted reproductive technology procedures. A number of protocols make use of gonadotropins in ovulation induction and controlled ovulation hyperstimulation, and new ones are continually being developed to improve the rates of success and to decrease the two primary risks of ovulation induction: multiple pregnancies and the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS; see below). Although the details differ, all of these protocols are based on the complex physiology that underlies a normal menstrual cycle. Like a menstrual cycle, ovulation induction is discussed in relation to a cycle that begins on the first day of a menstrual bleed (Figure 37-3). Shortly after the first day (usually on day 3), daily injections with one of the FSH preparations (hMG, urofollitropin) are begun and are continued for approximately $7-12$ days. In women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, follicle development requires treatment with a combination of FSH and LH because these women do not produce the basal level of LH that is required for adequate ovarian estrogen production and normal follicle development. The dose and duration of FSH treatment are based on the response as measured by the serum estradiol concentration and by ultrasound evaluation of ovarian follicle development and endometrial thickness. When exogenous gonadotropins are used to stimulate follicle development, there is risk of a premature endogenous surge in LH owing to the rapidly changing hormonal milieu. To prevent this, gonadotropins are almost always administered in conjunction with a drug that blocks the effects of endogenous GnRH-either continuous administration of a GnRH agonist, which down-regulates GnRH receptors, or a few days of treatment with a GnRH receptor antagonist (see below and Figure 37-3).

Figure 37-3.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-1117.jpg?height=920&width=1446&top_left_y=196&top_left_x=220)

Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in preparation for an assisted reproductive technology such as in vitro fertilization. Follicular phase: Follicle development is stimulated with gonadotropin injections that begin about 3 days after menses begin. When the follicles are ready, as assessed by measurement of serum estrogen concentration and ultrasound measurement of follicle size, final oocyte maturation is induced by an injection of hCG. Luteal phase: Shortly thereafter oocytes are retrieved and fertilized in vitro. The recipient's luteal phase is supported with injections of progesterone. To prevent a premature luteinizing hormone surge, endogenous gonadotropin secretion is inhibited during the follicular phase with either a GnRH agonist or a GnRH antagonist. In most protocols, the GnRH agonist is started midway through the preceding luteal cycle.

When appropriate follicular maturation has occurred, the FSH and GnRH agonist or GnRH antagonist injections are discontinued; the following day, hCG (5000-10,000 IU) is administered intramuscularly to induce final follicular maturation and, in ovulation induction protocols, ovulation. The hCG administration is followed by insemination in ovulation induction and by oocyte retrieval in assisted reproductive technology procedures. Because use of GnRH agonists or antagonists during the follicular phase of ovulation induction suppresses endogenous LH production, it is important to provide exogenous hormonal support of the luteal phase. In clinical trials, exogenous progesterone, hCG, or a combination of the two have been effective at providing adequate luteal support. However, progesterone is preferred because hCG for luteal support carries a higher risk of the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (see below).

\section*{MALE INFERTILITY}

Most of the signs and symptoms of hypogonadism in males (eg, delayed puberty, maintenance of secondary sex characteristics after puberty) can be adequately treated with exogenous androgen; however, treatment of infertility in hypogonadal men requires the activity of both LH and FSH. For many years, conventional therapy has consisted of initial treatment for 8-12 weeks with injections of 1000-2500 IU hCG several times per week. After the initial phase, hMG is injected at a dose of 75-150 units three times per week. In men with hypogonadal hypogonadism, it takes an average of 4-6
months of such treatment for sperm to appear in the ejaculate. With the more recent availability of urofollitropin, rFSH, and rLH, a number of alternative protocols have been developed. An advance that has indirectly benefited gonadotropin treatment of male infertility is intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), in which a single sperm is injected directly into a mature oocyte that has been retrieved after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation of a female partner. With the advent of ICSI, the minimum threshold of spermatogenesis required for pregnancy is greatly lowered.

\section*{Toxicity \& Contraindications}

In women treated with gonadotropins and hCG, the two most serious complications are the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and multiple pregnancies. Overstimulation of the ovary during ovulation induction often leads to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement that usually resolves spontaneously. The ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is a more serious complication that occurs in $0.5-4 \%$ of patients. It is characterized by ovarian enlargement, ascites, hydrothorax, and hypovolemia, sometimes resulting in shock. Hemoperitoneum (from a ruptured ovarian cyst), fever, and arterial thromboembolism can occur.

The probability of multiple pregnancies is greatly increased when ovulation induction and assisted reproductive technologies are used. In ovulation induction, the risk of multiple pregnancy is estimated to be 15-20\%, whereas the percentage of multiple pregnancies in the general population is closer to $1 \%$. Multiple pregnancies carry an increased risk of complications, such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and preterm labor. In IVF, the risk of multiple pregnancy is primarily determined by the number of embryos transferred to the recipient. A strong trend in recent years has been to transfer fewer embryos.

Other reported adverse effects of gonadotropin treatment are headache, depression, edema, precocious puberty, and (rarely) production of antibodies to hCG. In men treated with gonadotropins, the risk of gynecomastia is directly correlated with the level of testosterone produced in response to treatment. An association between ovarian cancer and fertility drugs has been reported. However, it is not known which, if any, fertility drugs are causally related to cancer.

\section*{GONADOTROPI N-RELEASI NG HORMONE \& ITS ANALOGS}

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone is secreted by neurons in the hypothalamus. It travels through the hypothalamic-pituitary venous portal plexus to the anterior pituitary, where it binds to G proteincoupled receptors on the plasma membranes of gonadotroph cells. Pulsatile GnRH secretion is required to stimulate the gonadotroph cell to produce and release LH and FSH.

Sustained, nonpulsatile administration of GnRH or GnRH analogs inhibits the release of FSH and LH by the pituitary in both women and men, resulting in hypogonadism. GnRH agonists are used to produce gonadal suppression in men with prostate cancer. They are also used in women who are undergoing assisted reproductive technology procedures or have a gynecologic problem that is benefited by ovarian suppression.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

\section*{STRUCTURE}

GnRH is a decapeptide found in all mammals. Gonadorelin is an acetate salt of synthetic human GnRH. Synthetic analogs include goserelin, histrelin, leuprolide, nafarelin, and triptorelin. These
analogs all have D-amino acids at position 6, and all but nafarelin have ethylamide substituted for glycine at position 10. Both modifications make them more potent and longer-lasting than native GnRH and gonadorelin.

\section*{PHARMACOKINETICS}

Gonadorelin can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. GnRH analogs can be administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly, via nasal spray (nafarelin), or as a subcutaneous implant. The halflife of intravenous gonadorelin is 4 minutes, and the half-lives of subcutaneous and intranasal GnRH analogs are approximately 3 hours. The duration of clinical uses of GnRH agonists varies from a few days for ovulation induction to a number of years for treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. Therefore, preparations have been developed with a range of durations of action from several hours (for daily administration) to $1,4,6$, or 12 months (depot forms).

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

The pharmacodynamic actions of GnRH exhibit complex dose-response relationships that change dramatically from the fetal period through the end of puberty. This is not surprising in view of the complex physiologic role that GnRH plays in normal reproduction, particularly in female reproduction. Pulsatile GnRH release occurs and is responsible for stimulating LH and FSH production during the fetal and neonatal period. However, from the age of 2 years until the onset of puberty, GnRH secretion falls off and the pituitary simultaneously exhibits very low sensitivity to the GnRH that is produced. Just before puberty, an increase in the frequency and amplitude of GnRH release occurs. In early puberty, pituitary sensitivity to GnRH increases. This is due in part to the effect of increasing concentrations of gonadal steroids. In females, it usually takes several months to a year after the onset of puberty for the hypothalamic-pituitary system to produce an LH surge and ovulation. By the end of puberty, the system is well established so that menstrual cycles proceed at relatively constant intervals. The amplitude and frequency of GnRH pulses also vary in a regular pattern through the menstrual cycle with the highest amplitudes occurring during the luteal phase and the highest frequency occurring late in the follicular phase. Lower pulse frequencies favor FSH secretion, whereas higher pulse frequencies favor LH secretion. Gonadal steroids as well as the peptide hormones activin and inhibin have complex modulatory effects on the gonadotropin response to GnRH.

In the pharmacologic use of GnRH and its analogs, pulsatile intravenous administration of gonadorelin every 1-4 hours stimulates FSH and LH secretion. Continuous administration of gonadorelin or its longer-acting analogs produces a biphasic response. During the first 7-10 days, an agonist effect occurs that results in increased concentrations of gonadal hormones in males and females. This initial phase is referred to as a flare. After this period, the continued presence of GnRH results in an inhibitory action that manifests as a drop in the concentration of gonadotropins and gonadal steroids. The inhibitory action is due to a combination of receptor down-regulation and changes in the signaling pathways activated by GnRH.

\section*{Clinical Pharmacology}

The GnRH agonists are occasionally used for stimulation of gonadotropin production. They are used far more commonly for suppression of gonadotropin release.

\section*{STI MULATI ON}

\section*{Female Infertility}

In the current era of widespread availability of gonadotropins and assisted reproductive technology, the use of pulsatile GnRH administration to treat infertility has become less common. Although pulsatile GnRH is less likely than gonadotropins to cause multiple pregnancies and the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, the inconvenience and cost associated with continuous use of an intravenous pump and difficulties obtaining native GnRH (gonadorelin) are barriers to pulsatile GnRH. When this approach is used, a portable battery-powered programmable pump and intravenous tubing deliver pulses of gonadorelin every 90 minutes.

Gonadorelin or a GnRH agonist analog can be used to precipitate an LH surge and ovulation in women with infertility who are undergoing ovulation induction with gonadotropins. Traditionally, hCG has been used to precipitate ovulation in this situation. However, there is some evidence that gonadorelin or a GnRH agonist is less likely than hCG to cause multiple ova to be released and less likely to cause the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

\section*{Male Infertility}

It is possible to use pulsatile gonadorelin for infertility in men with hypothalamic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. A portable pump infuses gonadorelin intravenously every 90 minutes. Serum testosterone levels and semen analyses must be done regularly. At least 3-6 months of pulsatile infusions are required before significant numbers of sperm are seen. The preferable alternative to intravenous gonadorelin treatment is the gonadotropin treatment described above.

\section*{Diagnosis of LH Responsiveness}

GnRH can be useful in determining whether delayed puberty in a hypogonadotropic adolescent is due to constitutional delay or to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The LH response (but not the FSH response) to a single dose of GnRH can distinguish between these two conditions. Serum LH levels are measured before and at various times after an intravenous or subcutaneous bolus of GnRH. An increase in serum LH with a peak that exceeds $15.6 \mathrm{mIU} / \mathrm{mL}$ is normal and suggests impending puberty. An impaired LH response suggests hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to either pituitary or hypothalamic disease, but does not rule out constitutional delay of adolescence.

\section*{SUPPRESSION OF GONADOTROPIN PRODUCTION}

\section*{Controlled Ovarian Hyperstimulation}

In the controlled ovarian hyperstimulation that provides multiple mature oocytes for assisted reproductive technologies such as IVF, it is critical to suppress an endogenous LH surge that could prematurely trigger ovulation. This suppression is most commonly achieved by daily subcutaneous injections of leuprolide or daily nasal applications of nafarelin. For leuprolide, treatment is commonly initiated with 1.0 mg daily for about 10 days or until menstrual bleeding occurs. At that point, the dose is reduced to 0.5 mg daily until hCG is administered (Figure 37-3). For nafarelin, the beginning dosage is generally 400 mcg twice a day, which is decreased to 200 mcg when menstrual bleeding occurs. In women who respond poorly to the standard protocol, alternative protocols that use shorter courses and lower doses of GnRH agonists may improve the follicular response to gonadotropins.

\section*{Endometriosis}

Endometriosis is a syndrome of cyclical abdominal pain in premenopausal women that is due to the presence of estrogen-sensitive endometrium-like tissue located outside the uterus. The pain of endometriosis is often reduced by abolishing exposure to the cyclical changes in the concentrations of estrogen and progesterone that are a normal part of the menstrual cycle. The ovarian suppression
induced by continuous treatment with a GnRH agonist greatly reduces estrogen and progesterone concentrations and prevents cyclical changes. The recommended duration of treatment with a GnRH agonist is limited to 6 months because ovarian suppression beyond this period can result in decreased bone density. Leuprolide, goserelin, and nafarelin are approved for this indication. Leuprolide and goserelin are administered as depot preparations that provide 1 or 3 months of continuous GnRH agonist activity. Nafarelin is administered twice daily as a nasal spray at a dose of 0.2 mg per spray.

\section*{Uterine Leiomyomata (Uterine Fibroids)}

Uterine leiomyomata are benign, estrogen-sensitive, fibrous growths in the uterus that can cause menorrhagia, with associated anemia and pelvic pain. Treatment for 3-6 months with a GnRH agonist reduces fibroid size and, when combined with supplemental iron, improves anemia. Leuprolide, goserelin, and nafarelin are approved for this indication. The doses and routes of administration are similar to those described for treatment of endometriosis.

\section*{Prostate Cancer}

Antiandrogen therapy is the primary medical therapy for prostate cancer. Combined antiandrogen therapy with continuous GnRH agonist and an androgen receptor antagonist such as flutamide (see Chapter 40) is as effective as surgical castration in reducing serum testosterone concentrations. Leuprolide, goserelin, histrelin, and triptorelin are approved for this indication. The preferred formulation is one of the long-acting depot forms that provide $1,3,4,6$, or 12 months of active drug therapy. During the first 7-10 days of GnRH analog therapy, serum testosterone levels increase because of the agonist action of the drug; this can precipitate pain in patients with bone metastases, and tumor growth and neurologic symptoms in patients with vertebral metastases. It can also temporarily worsen symptoms of urinary obstruction. Such tumor flares can usually be avoided with the concomitant administration of bicalutamide or one of the other androgen receptor antagonists (see Chapter 40). Within about 2 weeks, serum testosterone levels fall to the hypogonadal range.

\section*{Central Precocious Puberty}

Continuous administration of a GnRH agonist is indicated for treatment of central precocious puberty (onset of secondary sex characteristics before 8 years in girls or 9 years in boys). Before administering a GnRH agonist, one must confirm central precocious puberty by demonstrating a pubertal, not childhood, gonadotropin response to GnRH and a bone age at least 1 year beyond chronologic age. Pretreatment evaluation must also include gonadal steroid levels compatible with precocious puberty and not congenital adrenal hyperplasia; an hCG level that is low enough to exclude a chronic gonadotropin-secreting tumor; an MRI of the brain to exclude an intracranial tumor; and ultrasound examination of the adrenals and ovaries or testes to exclude a steroid-secreting tumor.

Treatment can be carried out with injections of leuprolide or nasal application of nafarelin. Leuprolide treatment is usually initiated at a dosage of $0.05 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight injected subcutaneously daily and then adjusted on the basis of the clinical response. Pediatric depot preparations of leuprolide are also available. The recommended initial dosage of nafarelin for central precocious puberty is $1.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. This is achieved with two unit dose sprays (each spray contains $0.1 \mathrm{~mL}, 0.2 \mathrm{mg}$ ) into each nostril twice daily. Treatment with a GnRH agonist is generally continued to age 11 in females and age 12 in males.

\section*{Other}

Other clinical uses for the gonadal suppression provided by continuous GnRH agonist treatment include advanced breast and ovarian cancer; thinning of the endometrial lining in preparation for an
endometrial ablation procedure in women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding; and treatment of amenorrhea and infertility in women with polycystic ovary disease.

\section*{Toxicity}

Gonadorelin can cause headache, light-headedness, nausea, and flushing. Local swelling often occurs at subcutaneous injection sites. Generalized hypersensitivity dermatitis has occurred after long-term subcutaneous administration. Rare acute hypersensitivity reactions include bronchospasm and anaphylaxis. Sudden pituitary apoplexy and blindness have been reported following administration of GnRH to a patient with a gonadotropin-secreting pituitary tumor.

Continuous treatment of women with a GnRH analog (leuprolide, nafarelin, goserelin) causes the typical symptoms of menopause, which include hot flushes, sweats, and headaches. Depression, diminished libido, generalized pain, vaginal dryness, and breast atrophy may also occur. Ovarian cysts may develop within the first 2 months of therapy and generally resolve after an additional 6 weeks; however, the cysts may persist and require discontinuation of therapy. Reduced bone density and osteoporosis may occur with prolonged use, so patients should be monitored with bone densitometry before repeated treatment courses. Depending on the condition being treated with the GnRH agonist, it may be possible to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of the hypoestrogenic state without losing clinical efficacy by adding back a small dose of a progestin and an estrogen. Contraindications to the use of GnRH agonists in women include pregnancy and breast-feeding.

In men treated with continuous GnRH agonist administration, adverse effects include hot flushes and sweats, edema, gynecomastia, decreased libido, decreased hematocrit, reduced bone density, asthenia, and injection site reactions. GnRH analog treatment of children is generally well tolerated. However, temporary exacerbation of precocious puberty may occur during the first few weeks of therapy. Nafarelin nasal spray may cause or aggravate sinusitis.

\section*{GNRH RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS}

Two synthetic decapeptides that function as competitive antagonists of GnRH receptors are available for clinical use. Ganirelix and cetrorelix inhibit the secretion of FSH and LH in a dose-dependent manner. Both are approved for use in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation as part of an assisted reproductive procedure such as IVF.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Ganirelix and cetrorelix are absorbed rapidly after subcutaneous injection. Administration of 0.25 mg daily maintains GnRH antagonism. Alternatively, a single $3.0-\mathrm{mg}$ dose of cetrorelix suppresses LH secretion for 96 hours.

\section*{Clinical Pharmacology}

GnRH antagonists are approved for preventing the LH surge during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. They offer several advantages over continuous treatment with a GnRH agonist. Because they produce an immediate antagonist effect, their use can be delayed until day 6-8 of the IVF cycle (Figure 37-3) and thus the duration of administration is shorter. They also appear to have a less negative impact on the ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation, which permits a decrease in the total duration and dose of gonadotropin. Finally, GnRH antagonists are associated with a lower risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, which can lead to cycle cancellation. On the other hand,
because their antagonist effects reverse more quickly after their discontinuation, adherence to the treatment regimen is critical. The antagonists produce a more complete suppression of gonadotropin secretion than agonists. There is concern that the suppression of LH may inhibit ovarian steroidogenesis to an extent that impairs follicular development when recombinant or the purified form of FSH is used during the follicular phase of an IVF cycle. Clinical trials have shown a slightly lower rate of pregnancy in IVF cycles that used GnRH antagonist treatment compared with cycles that used GnRH agonist treatment.

\section*{Toxicity}

The GnRH antagonists are well tolerated. The most common adverse effects are nausea and headache. When used for ovulation induction in combination with gonadotropins, the most serious toxicity is the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

\section*{PROLACTI N}

Prolactin is a 198-amino-acid peptide hormone produced in the anterior pituitary. Its structure resembles that of GH. Prolactin is the principal hormone responsible for lactation. Milk production is stimulated by prolactin when appropriate circulating levels of estrogens, progestins, corticosteroids, and insulin are present. A deficiency of prolactin-which can occur in rare states of pituitary deficiency-is manifested by failure to lactate or by a luteal phase defect. In rare cases of hypothalamic destruction, prolactin levels may be elevated as a result of impaired transport of dopamine (prolactin-inhibiting hormone) to the pituitary. Much more commonly, however, prolactin is elevated as a result of prolactin-secreting adenomas. Hyperprolactinemia produces a syndrome of amenorrhea and galactorrhea in women, and loss of libido and infertility in men. In the case of large tumors (macroadenomas), it can be associated with symptoms of a pituitary mass, including visual changes due to compression of the optic nerves. The hypogonadism and infertility associated with hyperprolactinemia result from inhibition of GnRH release.

No preparation of prolactin is available for use in prolactin-deficient patients. For patients with symptomatic hyperprolactinemia, inhibition of prolactin secretion can be achieved with dopamine agonists, which act in the pituitary to inhibit prolactin release.

\section*{DOPAMI NE AGONI STS}

Adenomas that secrete excess prolactin usually retain the sensitivity to inhibition by dopamine exhibited by the normal pituitary. Bromocriptine, cabergoline, and pergolide are ergot derivatives (see Chapters 16 and 28) with a high affinity for dopamine $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ receptors. Quinagolide, a drug approved in Europe, is a nonergot agent with similarly high $D_{2}$ receptor affinity. The chemical structure and pharmacokinetic features of ergot alkaloids are presented in Chapter 16.

Dopamine agonists suppress prolactin release very effectively in patients with hyperprolactinemia. Growth hormone release is reduced in patients with acromegaly, although not as effectively. Cabergoline, bromocriptine, and pergolide are also used in Parkinson's disease to improve motor function and reduce levodopa requirements (see Chapter 28).

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

All available dopamine agonists are active as oral preparations, and all are eliminated by metabolism. They can also be absorbed systemically after vaginal insertion of tablets. Cabergoline, with a half-life of
approximately 65 hours, has the longest duration of action. Pergolide and quinagolide have half-lives of about 20 hours, whereas the half-life of bromocriptine is about 7 hours. Following vaginal administration, serum levels peak more slowly.

\section*{Clinical Pharmacology}

\section*{HYPERPROLACTI NEMI A}

A dopamine agonist is the standard medical treatment for hyperprolactinemia. These drugs shrink pituitary prolactin-secreting tumors, lower circulating prolactin levels, and restore ovulation in approximately $70 \%$ of women with microadenomas and $30 \%$ of women with macroadenomas (Figure 37-4). Cabergoline is initiated at 0.25 mg twice weekly orally or vaginally. It can be increased gradually, according to serum prolactin determinations, up to a maximum of 1 mg twice weekly. Bromocriptine is generally taken daily after the evening meal at the initial dose of 1.25 mg ; the dose is then increased as tolerated. Most patients require $2.5-7.5 \mathrm{mg}$ daily. Long-acting oral bromocriptine formulations (Parlodel SRO) and intramuscular formulations (Parlodel L.A.R.) are available outside the USA.

Figure 37-4.

Results from a clinical trial of cabergoline in women with hyperprolactinemia and anovulation. A: The dotted line
indicates the upper limit of normal serum prolactin concentrations. B: Complete success was defined as pregnancy or at least two consecutive menses with evidence of ovulation at least once. Partial success was two menstrual cycles without evidence of ovulation or just one ovulatory cycle. The most common reasons for withdrawal from the trial were nausea, headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, and fatigue. (Modified and reproduced, with permission, from Webster J et al: A comparison of cabergoline and bromocriptine in the treatment of hyperprolactinemic amenorrhea. N Engl J Med 1994;331: 904.)

In doses of $0.15-0.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ orally, quinagolide suppresses prolactin and shrinks most prolactinomas. Quinagolide is sometimes better tolerated than ergot-derived dopamine agonists. It is not available in the USA.

\section*{PHYSIOLOGIC LACTATION}

Dopamine agonists were used in the past to prevent breast engorgement when breast feeding was not desired. Their use for this purpose has been discouraged because of toxicity (see Toxicity \& Contraindications).

\section*{ACROMEGALY}

A dopamine agonist alone or in combination with pituitary surgery, radiation therapy, or octreotide administration can be used to treat acromegaly. The doses required are higher than those used to treat hyperprolactinemia. For example, patients with acromegaly require 20 to $30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ of bromocriptine and seldom respond adequately to bromocriptine alone unless the pituitary tumor secretes prolactin as well as GH.

\section*{Toxicity \& Contraindications}

Dopamine agonists can cause nausea, headache, light-headedness, orthostatic hypotension, and fatigue. Psychiatric manifestations occasionally occur, even at lower doses, and may take months to resolve. Erythromelalgia occurs rarely. High dosages of ergot-derived preparations can cause coldinduced peripheral digital vasospasm. Pulmonary infiltrates have occurred with chronic high-dosage therapy. Cabergoline appears to cause nausea less often than bromocriptine. Vaginal administration can reduce nausea, but may cause local irritation.

Dopamine agonist therapy during the early weeks of pregnancy has not been associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion or congenital malformations. Although there has been a longer experience with the safety of bromocriptine during early pregnancy, there is growing evidence that cabergoline is also safe in women with macroadenomas who must continue a dopamine agonist during pregnancy. In patients with small pituitary adenomas, dopamine agonist therapy is discontinued upon conception because growth of microadenomas during pregnancy is rare. Patients with very large adenomas require vigilance for tumor progression and often require a dopamine agonist throughout pregnancy. There have been rare reports of stroke or coronary thrombosis in postpartum women taking bromocriptine to suppress postpartum lactation.

\section*{POSTERIOR PITUITARY HORMONES}

The two posterior pituitary hormones-vasopressin and oxytocin-are synthesized in neuronal cell bodies in the hypothalamus and then transported via their axons to the posterior pituitary, where they are stored and then released into the circulation. Each has limited but important clinical uses.

\section*{OXYTOCI N}

Oxytocin is a peptide hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary that participates in labor and delivery and elicits milk ejection in lactating women. During the second half of pregnancy, uterine smooth muscle shows an increase in the expression of oxytocin receptors and becomes increasingly sensitive to the stimulant action of endogenous oxytocin. Pharmacologic concentrations of oxytocin powerfully stimulate uterine contraction.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

\section*{STRUCTURE}

Oxytocin is a 9-amino-acid peptide with an intrapeptide disulfide cross-link (Figure 37-5). Its amino acid sequence differs from that of vasopressin at positions 3 and 8. Vasotocin is similar to oxytocin and vasopressin and is found in nonmammalian vertebrates.

Figure 37-5.

ABSORPTION, METABOLISM, AND EXCRETION
Oxytocin is administered intravenously for initiation and augmentation of labor. It also can be administered intramuscularly for control of postpartum bleeding. Oxytocin is not bound to plasma proteins and is eliminated by the kidneys and liver, with a circulating half-life of 5 minutes.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Oxytocin acts through G protein-coupled receptors and the phosphoinositide-calcium secondmessenger system to contract uterine smooth muscle. Oxytocin also stimulates the release of prostaglandins and leukotrienes that augment uterine contraction. Oxytocin in small doses increases both the frequency and force of uterine contractions. At higher doses, it produces sustained contraction.

Oxytocin also causes contraction of myoepithelial cells surrounding mammary alveoli, which leads to
milk ejection. Without oxytocin-induced contraction, normal lactation cannot occur. At high concentrations, oxytocin has weak antidiuretic and pressor activity due to activation of vasopressin receptors.

\section*{Clinical Pharmacology}

Oxytocin is used to induce labor for conditions requiring early vaginal delivery such as Rh problems, maternal diabetes, preeclampsia, or ruptured membranes. It is also used to augment abnormal labor that is protracted or displays an arrest disorder. Oxytocin has several uses in the immediate postpartum period, including the control of uterine hemorrhage after vaginal or cesarean delivery. It is sometimes used during second-trimester abortions.

Before delivery, oxytocin is usually administered intravenously via an infusion pump with appropriate fetal and maternal monitoring. For induction of labor, an initial infusion rate of $0.5-2 \mathrm{mU} / \mathrm{min}$ is increased every 30-60 minutes until a physiologic contraction pattern is established. The maximum infusion rate is $20 \mathrm{mU} / \mathrm{min}$. For postpartum uterine bleeding, 10-40 units are added to 1 L of $5 \%$ dextrose, and the infusion rate is titrated to control uterine atony. Alternatively, 10 units of oxytocin can be administered by intramuscular injection after delivery of the placenta.

During the antepartum period, oxytocin induces uterine contractions that transiently reduce placental blood flow to the fetus. The oxytocin challenge test measures the fetal heart rate response to a standardized oxytocin infusion and provides information about placental circulatory reserve. Oxytocin is infused at an initial rate of $0.5 \mathrm{mU} / \mathrm{min}$, then doubled every 20 minutes until uterine contractions decrease the fetal blood supply. An abnormal response, seen as late decelerations in the fetal heart rate, indicates fetal hypoxia and may warrant immediate cesarean delivery.

\section*{Toxicity \& Contraindications}

When oxytocin is used judiciously, serious toxicity is rare. The toxicity that does occur is due either to excessive stimulation of uterine contractions or to inadvertent activation of vasopressin receptors. Excessive stimulation of uterine contractions before deliver can cause fetal distress, placental abruption, or uterine rupture. These complications can be detected early by means of standard fetal monitoring equipment. High concentrations of oxytocin with activation of vasopressin receptors can cause excessive fluid retention, or water intoxication, leading to hyponatremia, heart failure, seizures, and death. Bolus injections of oxytocin can cause hypotension. To avoid hypotension, oxytocin is administered intravenously as dilute solutions at a controlled rate.

Contraindications to oxytocin include fetal distress, prematurity, abnormal fetal presentation, cephalopelvic disproportion, and other predispositions for uterine rupture.

\section*{OXYTOCI N ANTAGONI ST}

Atosiban is an antagonist of the oxytocin receptor that has been approved outside the USA as a treatment for preterm labor (tocolysis). Atosiban is a modified form of oxytocin that is administered by IV infusion for 2-48 hours. In a small number of published clinical trials, atosiban appears to be as effective as $B$-adrenoceptor-agonist tocolytics and to produce fewer adverse effects. However, in one placebo-controlled trial, the subject group that received atosiban had more infant deaths than the placebo group. In 1998, the FDA decided not to approve atosiban based on concerns about efficacy and safety.

\section*{VASOPRESSI N (ANTI DI URETI C HORMONE, ADH)}

Vasopressin is a peptide hormone released by the posterior pituitary in response to rising plasma tonicity or falling blood pressure. Vasopressin possesses antidiuretic and vasopressor properties. A deficiency of this hormone results in diabetes insipidus (see Chapters 15 and 17).

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

\section*{STRUCTURE}

Vasopressin is a nonapeptide with a 6-amino-acid ring and a 3-amino-acid side chain. The residue at position 8 is arginine in humans and in most other mammals except pigs and related species, whose vasopressin contains lysine at position 8 (Figure 37-5). Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP, 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) is a long-acting synthetic analog of vasopressin with minimal $\mathrm{V}_{1}$ activity and an antidiuretic-to-pressor ratio 4000 times that of vasopressin. Desmopressin is modified at position 1 and contains a D-amino acid at position 8. Like vasopressin and oxytocin, desmopressin has a disulfide linkage between positions 1 and 6.

\section*{ABSORPTION, METABOLISM, AND EXCRETION}

Vasopressin is administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection; oral administration is not effective because the peptide is inactivated by digestive enzymes. The half-life of circulating vasopressin is approximately 15 minutes, with renal and hepatic metabolism via reduction of the disulfide bond and peptide cleavage.

Desmopressin can be administered intravenously, subcutaneously, intranasally, or orally. The half-life of circulating desmopressin is $1.5-2.5$ hours. Nasal desmopressin is available as a unit dose spray that delivers 0.1 mL per spray; it is also available with a calibrated nasal tube that can be used to deliver a more precise dose. Nasal bioavailability of desmopressin is $3-4 \%$, whereas oral bioavailability is less than $1 \%$.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Vasopressin activates two subtypes of $G$ protein-coupled receptors (see Chapter 17). $V_{1}$ receptors are found on vascular smooth muscle cells and mediate vasoconstriction. $\mathrm{V}_{2}$ receptors are found on renal tubule cells and reduce diuresis through increased water permeability and water resorption in the collecting tubules. Extrarenal $\mathrm{V}_{2}$-like receptors regulate the release of coagulation factor VIII and von Willebrand factor.

\section*{Clinical Pharmacology}

Vasopressin and desmopressin are treatments of choice for pituitary diabetes insipidus. The dosage of desmopressin is $10-40 \mathrm{mcg}$ ( $0.1-0.4 \mathrm{~mL}$ ) in two to three divided doses as a nasal spray or, as an oral tablet, $0.1-0.2 \mathrm{mg}$ two to three times daily. The dosage by injection is $1-4 \mathrm{mcg}(0.25-1 \mathrm{~mL})$ every 12-24 hours as needed for polyuria, polydipsia, or hypernatremia. Bedtime desmopressin therapy, by intranasal or oral administration, ameliorates nocturnal enuresis by decreasing nocturnal urine production. Vasopressin infusion is effective in some cases of esophageal variceal bleeding and colonic diverticular bleeding.

Desmopressin is also used for the treatment of coagulopathy in hemophilia A and von Willebrand's disease (see Chapter 34).

\section*{Toxicity \& Contraindications}

Headache, nausea, abdominal cramps, agitation, and allergic reactions occur rarely. Therapy can result in hyponatremia and seizures.

Vasopressin (but not desmopressin) can cause vasoconstriction and should be used cautiously in patients with coronary artery disease. Nasal insufflation of desmopressin may be less effective when nasal congestion is present.

\section*{VASOPRESSI N ANTAGONISTS}

A group of nonpeptide antagonists of vasopressin receptors is being investigated for use in patients with hyponatremia or acute heart failure which is often associated with elevated concentrations of vasopressin. Conivaptan has high affinity for both $\mathrm{V}_{1 \mathrm{a}}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{2}$ receptors. Tolvaptan has 30 -fold higher affinity for $V_{2}$ than for $V_{1}$ receptors. In several clinical trials, both agents relieved symptoms and reduced objective signs of hyponatremia and heart failure. Conivaptan has been approved by the FDA for intravenous administration in hyponatremia but not in congestive heart failure. Several other nonselective nonpeptide vasopressin receptor antagonists are being investigated for these conditions.

\section*{THYROID PHYSIOLOGY}

The normal thyroid gland secretes sufficient amounts of the thyroid hormones-triiodothyronine ( $\mathbf{T}_{\mathbf{3}}$ ) and tetraiodothyronine ( $\mathbf{T}_{\mathbf{4}}$, thyroxine) - to normalize growth and development, body temperature, and energy levels. These hormones contain $59 \%$ and $65 \%$ (respectively) of iodine as an essential part of the molecule. Calcitonin, the second type of thyroid hormone, is important in the regulation of calcium metabolism and is discussed in Chapter 42.

\section*{I odide Metabolism}

The recommended daily adult iodide ( $I^{-}$)* intake is 150 mcg ( 200 mcg during pregnancy).
Iodide, ingested from food, water, or medication, is rapidly absorbed and enters an extracellular fluid pool. The thyroid gland removes about 75 mcg a day from this pool for hormone synthesis, and the balance is excreted in the urine. If iodide intake is increased, the fractional iodine uptake by the thyroid is diminished.

\section*{Biosynthesis of Thyroid Hormones}

Once taken up by the thyroid gland, iodide undergoes a series of enzymatic reactions that convert it into active thyroid hormone (Figure 38-1). The first step is the transport of iodide into the thyroid gland by an intrinsic follicle cell basement membrane protein called the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS). This can be inhibited by such anions as thiocyanate ( $\mathrm{SCN}^{-}$), pertechnetate ( $\mathrm{TcO}_{4}^{-}$), and perchlorate ( $\mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}$). At the apical cell membrane a second $\mathrm{I}^{-}$transport enzyme called pendrin controls the flow of iodide across the membrane. Pendrin is also found in the cochlea of the inner ear and if deficient or absent, a syndrome of deafness and goiter, called Pendred's syndrome, ensues. At the apical cell membrane, iodide is oxidized by thyroidal peroxidase to iodine, in which form it rapidly iodinates tyrosine residues within the thyroglobulin molecule to form monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). This process is called iodide organification. Thyroidal peroxidase is transiently blocked by high levels of intrathyroidal iodide and blocked more persistently by thioamide drugs.

Figure 38-1.

Two molecules of DIT combine within the thyroglobulin molecule to form L -thyroxine $\left(\mathrm{T}_{4}\right)$. One molecule of MIT and one molecule of DIT combine to form $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. In addition to thyroglobulin, other proteins within the gland may be iodinated, but these iodoproteins do not have hormonal activity. Thyroxine, $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, MIT, and DIT are released from thyroglobulin by exocytosis and proteolysis of thyroglobulin at the apical colloid border. The MIT and DIT are deiodinated within the gland, and the iodine is reutilized. This process of proteolysis is also blocked by high levels of intrathyroidal iodide. The ratio of $T_{4}$ to $T_{3}$ within thyroglobulin is approximately $5: 1$, so that most of the hormone released is thyroxine. Most of the $T_{3}$ circulating in the blood is derived from peripheral metabolism of thyroxine (see below, Figure 38-2).

Endocrinology, 7th ed. McGraw-Hill, 2004.)

\section*{Transport of Thyroid Hormones}
$T_{4}$ and $T_{3}$ in plasma are reversibly bound to protein, primarily thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). Only about $0.04 \%$ of total $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $0.4 \%$ of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ exist in the free form. Many physiologic and pathologic states and drugs affect $T_{4}, T_{3}$, and thyroid transport. However, the actual levels of free hormone generally remain normal, reflecting feedback control.

\section*{Peripheral Metabolism of Thyroid Hormones}

The primary pathway for the peripheral metabolism of thyroxine is deiodination. Deiodination of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ may occur by monodeiodination of the outer ring, producing 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine ( $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ ), which is three to four times more potent than $T_{4}$. Alternatively, deiodination may occur in the inner ring, producing 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (reverse $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, or $\mathrm{rT}_{3}$ ), which is metabolically inactive (Figure 38-2). Drugs such as amiodarone, iodinated contrast media, Bblockers, and corticosteroids, and severe illness or starvation inhibit the 5 '-deiodinase necessary for the conversion of $T_{4}$ to $T_{3}$, resulting in low $T_{3}$ and high $\mathrm{rT}_{3}$ levels in the serum. The pharmacokinetics of thyroid hormones are listed in Table 38-1. The low serum levels of $T_{3}$ and $r T_{3}$ in normal individuals are due to the high metabolic clearances of these two compounds.

\section*{THYROI D-PI TUITARY RELATI ONSHI PS}

Control of thyroid function via thyroid-pituitary feedback is also discussed in Chapter 37. Briefly, hypothalamic cells secrete thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) (Figure 38-3). TRH is secreted into capillaries of the pituitary portal venous system, and in the pituitary gland, TRH stimulates the synthesis and release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH in turn stimulates an adenylyl cyclase-mediated mechanism in the thyroid cell to increase the synthesis and release of $T_{4}$ and $T_{3}$. These thyroid hormones act in a negative feedback fashion in the pituitary to block the action of TRH and in the hypothalamus to inhibit the synthesis and secretion of TRH. Other hormones or drugs may also affect the release of TRH or TSH.

Figure 38-3.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-1140.jpg?height=1576&width=1657&top_left_y=784&top_left_x=223)

\section*{AUTOREGULATION OF THE THYROID GLAND}

The thyroid gland also regulates its uptake of iodide and thyroid hormone synthesis by intrathyroidal mechanisms that are independent of TSH. These mechanisms are primarily related to the level of iodine in the blood. Large doses of iodine inhibit iodide organification (Wolff-Chaikoff block, see Figure 38-1). In certain disease states (eg, Hashimoto's thyroiditis), this can inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis and result in hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism can result from the loss of the Wolff-Chaikoff block in susceptible individuals (eg, multinodular goiter).

\section*{ABNORMAL THYROID STI MULATORS}

In Graves' disease (see below), lymphocytes secrete a TSH receptor-stimulating antibody (TSH-R Ab [stim]), also known as thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI). This immunoglobulin binds to the TSH receptor and turns on the gland in the same fashion as TSH itself. The duration of its effect, however, is much longer than that of TSH. TSH receptors are also found in orbital fibrocytes, which may be stimulated by high levels of TSH-R Ab [stim].
*In this chapter, the term "iodine" denotes all forms of the element; the term "iodide" denotes only the ionic form, $\mathrm{I}^{-}$.

\section*{BASIC PHARMACOLOGY OF THYROI D \& ANTITHYROI D DRUGS THYROID HORMONES}

\section*{Chemistry}

The structural formulas of thyroxine and triiodothyronine as well as reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) are shown in Figure 38-2. All of these naturally occurring molecules are levo (L) isomers. The synthetic dextro (D) isomer of thyroxine, dextrothyroxine, has approximately $4 \%$ of the biologic activity of the L isomer as evidenced by its lesser ability to suppress TSH secretion and correct hypothyroidism.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Thyroxine is absorbed best in the duodenum and ileum; absorption is modified by intraluminal factors such as food, drugs, and intestinal flora. Oral bioavailability of current preparations of l-thyroxine averages $80 \%$ (Table 38-1). In contrast, $T_{3}$ is almost completely absorbed ( $95 \%$ ). $T_{4}$ and $T_{3}$ absorption appears not to be affected by mild hypothyroidism but may be impaired in severe myxedema with ileus. These factors are important in switching from oral to parenteral therapy. For parenteral use, the intravenous route is preferred for both hormones.

In patients with hyperthyroidism, the metabolic clearances of $T_{4}$ and $T_{3}$ are increased and the half-lives decreased; the opposite is true in patients with hypothyroidism. Drugs that induce hepatic microsomal enzymes (eg, rifampin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, imatinib, protease inhibitors) increase the metabolism of both $T_{4}$ and $T_{3}$ (Table 38-3). Despite this change in clearance, the normal hormone concentration is maintained in euthyroid patients as a result of compensatory hyperfunction of the thyroid. However, patients receiving $T_{4}$ replacement medication may require increased dosages to maintain clinical effectiveness. A similar compensation occurs if binding sites are altered. If TBG sites are increased by pregnancy, estrogens, or oral contraceptives, there is an initial shift of hormone from the free to the bound state and a decrease in its rate of elimination until the normal hormone concentration is restored. Thus, the concentration of total and bound hormone will increase, but the
concentration of free hormone and the steady-state elimination will remain normal. The reverse occurs when thyroid binding sites are decreased.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

A model of thyroid hormone action is depicted in Figure 38-4, which shows the free forms of thyroid hormones, $T_{4}$ and $T_{3}$, dissociated from thyroid-binding proteins, entering the cell by active transport. Within the cell, $T_{4}$ is converted to $T_{3}$ by $5^{\prime}$-deiodinase, and the $T_{3}$ enters the nucleus, where $T_{3}$ binds to a specific $T_{3}$ receptor protein, a member of the c-erb oncogene family. (This family also includes the steroid hormone receptors and receptors for vitamins A and D .) The $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ receptor exists in two forms, Q . and $B$. Differing concentrations of receptor forms in different tissues may account for variations in $T_{3}$ effect on different tissues.

Model of the interaction of $T_{3}$ with the $T_{3}$ receptor. A: Inactive phase-the unliganded $T_{3}$ receptor dimer bound to the thyroid hormone response element (TRE) along with corepressors acts as a suppressor of gene transcription.
B: Active phase- $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ circulate bound to thyroid-binding proteins (TBPs). The free hormones are transported into the cell by a specific transport system. Within the cytoplasm, $T_{4}$ is converted to $T_{3}$ by 5'deiodinase; $T_{3}$ then moves into the nucleus. There it binds to the ligand-binding domain of the thyroid receptor (TR) monomer. This promotes disruption of the TR homodimer and heterodimerization with retinoid $X$ receptor (RXR) on the TRE, displacement of corepressors, and binding of coactivators. The TR-coactivator complex activates gene transcription, which leads to alteration in protein synthesis and cellular phenotype. (TR-LBD, $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ receptor ligand-binding domain; TR-DBD, $T_{3}$ receptor DNA-binding domain; RXR-LBD, retinoid $X$ receptor ligandbinding domain; RXR-DBD, retinoid X receptor DNA-binding domain; $T_{3}$, triiodothyronine; $T_{4}$, tetraiodothyronine, L-thyroxine; 5'DI, 5'deiodinase.

Most of the effects of thyroid on metabolic processes appear to be mediated by activation of nuclear receptors that lead to increased formation of RNA and subsequent protein synthesis, eg, increased formation of $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase. This is consistent with the observation that the action of thyroid is manifested in vivo with a time lag of hours or days after its administration.

Large numbers of thyroid hormone receptors are found in the most hormone-responsive tissues (pituitary, liver, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, lung, and intestine), while few receptor sites occur in hormone-unresponsive tissues (spleen, testes). The brain, which lacks an anabolic response to $T_{3}$, contains an intermediate number of receptors. In congruence with their biologic potencies, the affinity of the receptor site for $T_{4}$ is about ten times lower than that for $T_{3}$. The number of nuclear receptors may be altered to preserve body homeostasis. For example, starvation lowers both circulating $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ hormone and cellular $T_{3}$ receptors.

\section*{Effects of Thyroid Hormones}

The thyroid hormones are responsible for optimal growth, development, function, and maintenance of all body tissues. Excess or inadequate amounts result in the signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, respectively (Table 38-4). Since $T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$ are qualitatively similar, they may be considered as one hormone in the discussion that follows.

${ }^{1}$ The anemia of hyperthyroidism is usually normochromic and caused by increased red blood cell turnover. The anemia of hypothyroidism may be normochromic, hyperchromic, or hypochromic and may be due to decreased production rate, decreased iron absorption, decreased folic acid absorption, or to autoimmune pernicious anemia. (LDH, lactic dehydrogenase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase.)

Thyroid hormone is critical for nervous, skeletal, and reproductive tissues. Its effects depend on protein synthesis as well as potentiation of the secretion and action of growth hormone. Thyroid deprivation in early life results in irreversible mental retardation and dwarfism-symptoms typical of congenital cretinism.

Effects on growth and calorigenesis are accompanied by a pervasive influence on metabolism of drugs as well as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and vitamins. Many of these changes are dependent upon or modified by activity of other hormones. Conversely, the secretion and degradation rates of virtually all other hormones, including catecholamines, cortisol, estrogens, testosterone, and insulin, are affected by thyroid status.

Many of the manifestations of thyroid hyperactivity resemble sympathetic nervous system overactivity (especially in the cardiovascular system), although catecholamine levels are not increased. Changes in catecholamine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity as measured by cAMP are found with changes in thyroid activity. Possible explanations include increased numbers of Breceptors or enhanced amplification of the Breceptor signal. Other clinical symptoms reminiscent of excessive epinephrine activity (and partially alleviated by adrenoceptor antagonists) include lid lag and retraction, tremor, excessive sweating, anxiety, and nervousness. The opposite constellation of symptoms is seen in hypothyroidism (Table 38-4).

\section*{Thyroid Preparations}

See the Preparations Available section at the end of this chapter for a list of available preparations. These preparations may be synthetic (levothyroxine, liothyronine, liotrix) or of animal origin (desiccated thyroid).

Thyroid hormones are not effective and can be detrimental in the management of obesity, abnormal vaginal bleeding, or depression if thyroid hormone levels are normal. Anecdotal reports of a beneficial effect of $T_{3}$ administered with antidepressants have not been confirmed with a controlled study.

Synthetic levothyroxine is the preparation of choice for thyroid replacement and suppression therapy because of its stability, content uniformity, low cost, lack of allergenic foreign protein, easy laboratory measurement of serum levels, and long half-life (7 days), which permits once-daily administration. In addition, $T_{4}$ is converted to $T_{3}$ intracellularly; thus, administration of $T_{4}$ produces both hormones. Generic levothyroxine preparations provide comparable efficacy and are more cost-effective than branded preparations.

Although liothyronine ( $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ ) is three to four times more potent than levothyroxine, it is not recommended for routine replacement therapy because of its shorter half-life ( 24 hours), which requires multiple daily doses; its higher cost; and the greater difficulty of monitoring its adequacy of replacement by conventional laboratory tests. Furthermore, because of its greater hormone activity and consequent greater risk of cardiotoxicity, $T_{3}$ should be avoided in patients with cardiac disease. It is best used for short-term suppression of TSH. Because oral administration of $T_{3}$ is unnecessary, use of the more expensive mixture of thyroxine and liothyronine (liotrix) instead of levothyroxine is never required.

The use of desiccated thyroid rather than synthetic preparations is never justified, since the disadvantages of protein antigenicity, product instability, variable hormone concentrations, and difficulty in laboratory monitoring far outweigh the advantage of low cost. Significant amounts of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ found in some thyroid extracts and liotrix may produce significant elevations in $T_{3}$ levels and toxicity. Equivalent doses are 100 mg of desiccated thyroid, 100 mcg of levothyroxine, and 37.5 mcg of liothyronine.

The shelf life of synthetic hormone preparations is about 2 years, particularly if they are stored in dark bottles to minimize spontaneous deiodination. The shelf life of desiccated thyroid is not known with certainty, but its potency is better preserved if it is kept dry.

\section*{ANTITHYROID AGENTS}

Reduction of thyroid activity and hormone effects can be accomplished by agents that interfere with the production of thyroid hormones, by agents that modify the tissue response to thyroid hormones, or
by glandular destruction with radiation or surgery. Goitrogens are agents that suppress secretion of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $T_{4}$ to subnormal levels and thereby increase TSH, which in turn produces glandular enlargement (goiter). The antithyroid compounds used clinically include the thioamides, iodides, and radioactive iodine.

\section*{Thioamides}

The thioamides methimazole and propylthiouracil are major drugs for treatment of thyrotoxicosis. In the United Kingdom, carbimazole, which is converted to methimazole in vivo, is widely used. Methimazole is about ten times more potent than propylthiouracil.

The chemical structures of these compounds are shown in Figure 38-5. The thiocarbamide group is essential for antithyroid activity.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Propylthiouracil is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak serum levels after 1 hour. The bioavailability of 50-80\% may be due to incomplete absorption or a large first-pass effect in the liver. The volume of distribution approximates total body water with accumulation in the thyroid gland. Most of an ingested dose of propylthiouracil is excreted by the kidney as the inactive glucuronide within 24 hours.

In contrast, methimazole is completely absorbed but at variable rates. It is readily accumulated by the thyroid gland and has a volume of distribution similar to that of propylthiouracil. Excretion is slower than with propylthiouracil; 65-70\% of a dose is recovered in the urine in 48 hours.

The short plasma half-life of these agents (1.5 hours for propylthiouracil and 6 hours for methimazole) has little influence on the duration of the antithyroid action or the dosing interval because both agents are accumulated by the thyroid gland. For propylthiouracil, giving the drug every 6-8 hours is reasonable since a single 100 mg dose can inhibit iodine organification by $60 \%$ for 7 hours. Since a single 30 mg dose of methimazole exerts an antithyroid effect for longer than 24 hours, a single daily dose is effective in the management of mild to moderate hyperthyroidism.

Both thioamides cross the placental barrier and are concentrated by the fetal thyroid, so that caution must be employed when using these drugs in pregnancy. Because of the risk of fetal hypothyroidism, both thioamides are classified as pregnancy category D (evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience). Of the two, propylthiouracil is preferable in pregnancy because it is more strongly protein-bound and, therefore, crosses the placenta less readily. In addition, methimazole has been, albeit rarely, associated with congenital malformations. Both thioamides are secreted in low concentrations in breast milk but are considered safe for the nursing infant.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

The thioamides act by multiple mechanisms. The major action is to prevent hormone synthesis by inhibiting the thyroid peroxidase-catalyzed reactions and blocking iodine organification. In addition, they block coupling of the iodotyrosines. They do not block uptake of iodide by the gland.
Propylthiouracil and (to a much lesser extent) methimazole inhibit the peripheral deiodination of $T_{4}$ and $T_{3}$ (Figure 38-1). Since the synthesis rather than the release of hormones is affected, the onset of these agents is slow, often requiring 3-4 weeks before stores of $T_{4}$ are depleted.

\section*{Toxicity}

Adverse reactions to the thioamides occur in 3-12\% of treated patients. Most reactions occur early, especially nausea and gastrointestinal distress. An altered sense of taste or smell may occur with methimazole. The most common adverse effect is a maculopapular pruritic rash ( $4-6 \%$ ), at times accompanied by systemic signs such as fever. Rare adverse effects include an urticarial rash, vasculitis, a lupus-like reaction, lymphadenopathy, hypoprothrombinemia, exfoliative dermatitis, polyserositis, and acute arthralgia. Hepatitis (more common with propylthiouracil) and cholestatic jaundice (more common with methimazole) can be fatal; although asymptomatic elevations in transaminase levels also occur.

The most dangerous complication is agranulocytosis (granulocyte count $<500$ cells $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ ), an infrequent but potentially fatal adverse reaction. It occurs in $0.1-0.5 \%$ of patients taking thioamides, but the risk may be increased in older patients and in those receiving high-dose methimazole therapy ( $>40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ). The reaction is usually rapidly reversible when the drug is discontinued, but broadspectrum antibiotic therapy may be necessary for complicating infections. Colony-stimulating factors (eg, G-CSF; see Chapter 33) may hasten recovery of the granulocytes. The cross-sensitivity between propylthiouracil and methimazole is about $50 \%$; therefore, switching drugs in patients with severe reactions is not recommended.

\section*{Anion Inhibitors}

Monovalent anions such as perchlorate ( $\mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}$), pertechnetate ( $\mathrm{TcO}_{4}^{-}$), and thiocyanate ( $\mathrm{SCN}^{-}$) can block uptake of iodide by the gland through competitive inhibition of the iodide transport mechanism.

Since these effects can be overcome by large doses of iodides, their effectiveness is somewhat unpredictable.

The major clinical use for potassium perchlorate is to block thyroidal reuptake of $\mathrm{I}^{-}$in patients with iodide-induced hyperthyroidism (eg, amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism). However, potassium perchlorate is rarely used clinically because it is associated with aplastic anemia.

\section*{I odides}

Prior to the introduction of the thioamides in the 1940s, iodides were the major antithyroid agents; today they are rarely used as sole therapy.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Iodides have several actions on the thyroid. They inhibit organification and hormone release and decrease the size and vascularity of the hyperplastic gland. In susceptible individuals, iodides can induce hyperthyroidism (jodbasedow phenomenon) or precipitate hypothyroidism.

In pharmacologic doses ( $>6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ), the major action of iodides is to inhibit hormone release, possibly through inhibition of thyroglobulin proteolysis. Improvement in thyrotoxic symptoms occurs rapidly-within 2-7 days-hence the value of iodide therapy in thyroid storm. In addition, iodides decrease the vascularity, size, and fragility of a hyperplastic gland, making the drugs valuable as preoperative preparation for surgery.

\section*{Clinical Use of I odide}

Disadvantages of iodide therapy include an increase in intraglandular stores of iodine, which may delay onset of thioamide therapy or prevent use of radioactive iodine therapy for several weeks. Thus, iodides should be initiated after onset of thioamide therapy and avoided if treatment with radioactive iodine seems likely. Iodide should not be used alone, because the gland will escape from the iodide block in 2-8 weeks, and its withdrawal may produce severe exacerbation of thyrotoxicosis in an iodineenriched gland. Chronic use of iodides in pregnancy should be avoided, since they cross the placenta and can cause fetal goiter. In radiation emergencies, the thyroid-blocking effects of potassium iodide can protect the gland from subsequent damage if administered before radiation exposure.

\section*{Toxicity}

Adverse reactions to iodine (iodism) are uncommon and in most cases reversible upon discontinuance. They include acneiform rash (similar to that of bromism), swollen salivary glands, mucous membrane ulcerations, conjunctivitis, rhinorrhea, drug fever, metallic taste, bleeding disorders and, rarely, anaphylactoid reactions.

\section*{I odinated Contrast Media}

The iodinated contrast agents-diatrizoate orally and iohexol orally or intravenously-are valuable in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, although they are not labeled for this indication. These drugs rapidly inhibit the conversion of $T_{4}$ to $T_{3}$ in the liver, kidney, pituitary gland, and brain. This accounts for the dramatic improvement in both subjective and objective parameters. For example, a decrease in heart rate is seen after only 3 days of administration of $0.5-1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ of oral contrast media. $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ levels often return to normal during this time. The prolonged effect of suppressing $T_{4}$ as well as $T_{3}$ suggests that inhibition of hormone release due to the iodine released may be an additional mechanism of action.

Fortunately, these agents are relatively nontoxic. They provide useful adjunctive therapy in the treatment of thyroid storm and offer valuable alternatives when iodides or thioamides are contraindicated. Surprisingly, these agents may not interfere with ${ }^{131}$ l retention as much as iodides despite their large iodine content. Their toxicity is similar to that of the iodides, and their safety in pregnancy is undocumented.

\section*{Radioactive I odine}
${ }^{131}$ I is the only isotope used for treatment of thyrotoxicosis (others are used in diagnosis). Administered orally in solution as sodium ${ }^{131}$, it is rapidly absorbed, concentrated by the thyroid, and incorporated into storage follicles. Its therapeutic effect depends on emission of Brays with an effective half-life of 5 days and a penetration range of 400-2000 $\mu \mathrm{m}$. Within a few weeks after administration, destruction of the thyroid parenchyma is evidenced by epithelial swelling and necrosis, follicular disruption, edema, and leukocyte infiltration. Advantages of radioiodine include easy administration, effectiveness, low expense, and absence of pain. Fears of radiation-induced genetic damage, leukemia, and neoplasia have not been realized after more than 50 years of clinical experience with radioiodine. Radioactive iodine should not be administered to pregnant women or nursing mothers, since it crosses the placenta to destroy the fetal thyroid gland and is excreted in breast milk.

\section*{Adrenoceptor-Blocking Agents}

Beta blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (eg, metoprolol, propranolol, atenolol) are effective therapeutic adjuncts in the management of thyrotoxicosis since many of these symptoms mimic those associated with sympathetic stimulation. Propranolol has been the Bblocker most widely studied and used in the therapy of thyrotoxicosis. Beta blockers cause clinical improvement of hyperthyroid symptoms but do not alter thyroid hormone levels.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF THYROI D \& ANTI THYROI D DRUGS HYPOTHYROI DISM}

Hypothyroidism is a syndrome resulting from deficiency of thyroid hormones and is manifested largely by a reversible slowing down of all body functions (Table 38-4). In infants and children, there is striking retardation of growth and development that results in dwarfism and irreversible mental retardation.

The etiology and pathogenesis of hypothyroidism are outlined in Table 38-5. Hypothyroidism can occur with or without thyroid enlargement (goiter). The laboratory diagnosis of hypothyroidism in the adult is easily made by the combination of a low free thyroxine and elevated serum TSH (Table 38-2).

${ }^{2}$ See Table 38-3 for specific pathogenesis.
The most common cause of hypothyroidism in the USA at this time is probably Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an immunologic disorder in genetically predisposed individuals. In this condition, there is evidence of humoral immunity in the presence of antithyroid antibodies and lymphocyte sensitization to thyroid antigens. Certain medications can also cause hypothyroidism (Table 38-5).

\section*{Management of Hypothyroidism}

Except for hypothyroidism caused by drugs (Table 38-5), which can be treated in some cases by simply removing the depressant agent, the general strategy of replacement therapy is appropriate. The most satisfactory preparation is levothyroxine, administered as either a branded or generic preparation. Treatment with combination levothyroxine plus liothyronine has not been found to be superior to levothyroxine alone. Infants and children require more $T_{4}$ per kilogram of body weight than adults. The average dosage for an infant $1-6$ months of age is $10-15 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$, whereas the average dosage for an adult is about $1.7 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. Older adults (> 65 years of age) may require less thyroxine for replacement. There is some variability in the absorption of thyroxine, so this dosage will vary from patient to patient. Since interactions with certain foods (eg, bran, soy) and drugs (Table 38-3) can
impair its absorption, thyroxine should be administered on an empty stomach (eg, 30 minutes before meals or 1 hour after meals). Its long half-life of 7 days permits once daily dosing. Children should be monitored for normal growth and development. Serum TSH and free thyroxine should be measured at regular intervals and TSH maintained within an optimal range of $0.5-2.5 \mathrm{mU} / \mathrm{L}$. It takes 6-8 weeks after starting a given dose of thyroxine to reach steady-state levels in the bloodstream. Thus, dosage changes should be made slowly.

In long-standing hypothyroidism, in older patients, and in patients with underlying cardiac disease, it is imperative to start treatment with reduced dosages. In such adult patients, levothyroxine is given in a dosage of 12.5-25 mcg/d for 2 weeks, increasing the daily dose by 25 mcg every 2 weeks until euthyroidism or drug toxicity is observed. In older patients, the heart is very sensitive to the level of circulating thyroxine, and if angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia develops, it is essential to stop or reduce the dose of thyroxine immediately. In younger patients or those with very mild disease, full replacement therapy may be started immediately.

The toxicity of thyroxine is directly related to the hormone level. In children, restlessness, insomnia, and accelerated bone maturation and growth may be signs of thyroxine toxicity. In adults, increased nervousness, heat intolerance, episodes of palpitation and tachycardia, or unexplained weight loss may be the presenting symptoms. If these symptoms are present, it is important to monitor serum TSH (Table 38-2), which will determine whether the symptoms are due to excess thyroxine blood levels. Chronic overtreatment with $T_{4}$, particularly in elderly patients, can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation and accelerated osteoporosis.

\section*{Special Problems in Management of Hypothyroidism MYXEDEMA AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE}

Since myxedema frequently occurs in older persons, it is often associated with underlying coronary artery disease. In this situation, the low levels of circulating thyroid hormone actually protect the heart against increasing demands that could result in angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. Correction of myxedema must be done cautiously to avoid provoking arrhythmia, angina, or acute myocardial infarction. If coronary artery surgery is indicated, it should be done first, prior to correction of the myxedema by thyroxine administration.

\section*{MYXEDEMA COMA}

Myxedema coma is an end state of untreated hypothyroidism. It is associated with progressive weakness, stupor, hypothermia, hypoventilation, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, water intoxication, shock, and death.

Management of myxedema coma is a medical emergency. The patient should be treated in the intensive care unit, since tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required. Associated illnesses such as infection or heart failure must be treated by appropriate therapy. It is important to give all preparations intravenously, because patients with myxedema coma absorb drugs poorly from other routes. Intravenous fluids should be administered with caution to avoid excessive water intake. These patients have large pools of empty $T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$ binding sites that must be filled before there is adequate free thyroxine to affect tissue metabolism. Accordingly, the treatment of choice in myxedema coma is to give a loading dose of levothyroxine intravenously-usually $300-400 \mathrm{mcg}$ initially, followed by $50-100 \mathrm{mcg}$ daily. Intravenous $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ can also be used but may be more cardiotoxic and more difficult
to monitor. Intravenous hydrocortisone is indicated if the patient has associated adrenal or pituitary insufficiency but is probably not necessary in most patients with primary myxedema. Opioids and sedatives must be used with extreme caution.

\section*{HYPOTHYROIDISM AND PREGNANCY}

Hypothyroid women frequently have anovulatory cycles and are therefore relatively infertile until restoration of the euthyroid state. This has led to the widespread use of thyroid hormone for infertility, although there is no evidence for its usefulness in infertile euthyroid patients. In a pregnant hypothyroid patient receiving thyroxine, it is extremely important that the daily dose of thyroxine be adequate because early development of the fetal brain depends on maternal thyroxine. In many hypothyroid patients, an increase in the thyroxine dose (about $30-50 \%$ ) is required to normalize the serum TSH level during pregnancy. Because of the elevated maternal TBG levels and, therefore, elevated total $T_{4}$ levels, adequate maternal thyroxine dosages warrant maintenance of TSH between 0.5 and $3.0 \mathrm{mU} / \mathrm{L}$ and the total $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ at or above the upper range of normal.

\section*{SUBCLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM}

Subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as an elevated TSH level and normal thyroid hormone levels, is found in $4-10 \%$ of the general population but increases to $20 \%$ in women older than age 50 . The consensus of expert thyroid organizations concluded that thyroid hormone therapy should be considered for patients with TSH levels greater than $10 \mathrm{mU} / \mathrm{L}$ while close TSH monitoring is appropriate for those with lower TSH elevations.

\section*{DRUG-INDUCED HYPOTHYROIDISM}

Drug-induced hypothyroidism (Table 38-3) can be satisfactorily managed with levothyroxine therapy if the offending agent cannot be stopped. In the case of amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism, levothyroxine therapy may be necessary even after discontinuance because of amiodarone's very long half-life.

\section*{HYPERTHYROI DISM}

Hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis) is the clinical syndrome that results when tissues are exposed to high levels of thyroid hormone (Table 38-4).

\section*{Graves' Disease}

The most common form of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease, or diffuse toxic goiter. The presenting signs and symptoms of Graves' disease are set forth in Table 38-4.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Graves' disease is considered to be an autoimmune disorder in which helper T lymphocytes stimulate B lymphocytes to synthesize antibodies to thyroidal antigens. The antibody described previously (TSH-R Ab [stim]) is directed against the TSH receptor site in the thyroid cell membrane and has the capacity to stimulate growth and biosynthetic activity of the thyroid cell. Spontaneous remission occurs but some patients require years of antithyroid therapy.

\section*{Laboratory Diagnosis}

In most patients with hyperthyroidism, $T_{3}, T_{4}, \mathrm{FT}_{4}$, and $\mathrm{FT}_{3}$ are elevated and TSH is suppressed (Table 38-2). Radioiodine uptake is usually markedly elevated as well. Antithyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase, and TSH-R Ab [stim] antibodies are usually present.

\section*{Management of Graves' Disease}

The three primary methods for controlling hyperthyroidism are antithyroid drug therapy, surgical thyroidectomy, and destruction of the gland with radioactive iodine.

\section*{ANTITHYROID DRUG THERAPY}

Drug therapy is most useful in young patients with small glands and mild disease. Methimazole or propylthiouracil is administered until the disease undergoes spontaneous remission. This is the only therapy that leaves an intact thyroid gland, but it does require a long period of treatment and observation (12-18 months), and there is a 50-68\% incidence of relapse.

Methimazole is preferable to propylthiouracil (except in pregnancy) because it can be administered once daily, which may enhance adherence. Antithyroid drug therapy is usually begun with divided doses, shifting to maintenance therapy with single daily doses when the patient becomes clinically euthyroid. However, mild to moderately severe thyrotoxicosis can often be controlled with methimazole given in a single morning dose of $20-40 \mathrm{mg}$ initially for $4-8$ weeks to normalize hormone levels. Maintenance therapy requires $5-15 \mathrm{mg}$ once daily. Alternatively, therapy is started with propylthiouracil, $100-150 \mathrm{mg}$ every 6 or 8 hours until the patient is euthyroid, followed by gradual reduction of the dose to the maintenance level of $50-150 \mathrm{mg}$ once daily. In addition to inhibiting iodine organification, propylthiouracil also inhibits the conversion of $T_{4}$ to $T_{3}$, so it brings the level of activated thyroid hormone down more quickly than does methimazole. The best clinical guide to remission is reduction in the size of the goiter. Laboratory tests most useful in monitoring the course of therapy are serum $\mathrm{FT}_{3}, \mathrm{FT}_{4}$, and TSH levels.

Reactivation of the autoimmune process may occur when the dosage of antithyroid drug is lowered during maintenance therapy and TSH begins to drive the gland. In some cases TSH release can be prevented by the daily administration of $50-150 \mathrm{mcg}$ of levothyroxine with $5-15 \mathrm{mg}$ of methimazole or $50-150 \mathrm{mg}$ of propylthiouracil for the second year of therapy. The relapse rate with this program is probably comparable to the rate with antithyroid therapy alone, but the risk of hypothyroidism and overtreatment is avoided.

Reactions to antithyroid drugs have been described above. A minor rash can often be controlled by antihistamine therapy. Because the more severe reaction of agranulocytosis is often heralded by sore throat or high fever, patients receiving antithyroid drugs must be instructed to discontinue the drug and seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms develop. White cell and differential counts and a throat culture are indicated in such cases, followed by appropriate antibiotic therapy.

\section*{THYROIDECTOMY}

A near-total thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with very large glands or multinodular goiters. Patients are treated with antithyroid drugs until euthyroid (about 6 weeks). In addition, for 10-14 days prior to surgery, they receive saturated solution of potassium iodide, 5 drops twice daily, to diminish vascularity of the gland and simplify surgery. About $80-90 \%$ of patients will require thyroid supplementation following near-total thyroidectomy.

\section*{RADIOACTIVE IODINE}

Radioiodine therapy utilizing ${ }^{131}$ I is the preferred treatment for most patients over 21 years of age. In patients without heart disease, the therapeutic dose may be given immediately in a range of 80-120 H. $\mathrm{Ci} / \mathrm{g}$ of estimated thyroid weight corrected for uptake. In patients with underlying heart disease or
severe thyrotoxicosis and in elderly patients, it is desirable to treat with antithyroid drugs (preferably methimazole) until the patient is euthyroid. The medication is then stopped for 5-7 days before the appropriate dose of ${ }^{131}$ I is administered. Iodides should be avoided to ensure maximal ${ }^{131}$ I uptake. Six to 12 weeks following the administration of radioiodine, the gland will shrink in size and the patient will usually become euthyroid or hypothyroid. A second dose may be required in some patients. Hypothyroidism occurs in about $80 \%$ of patients following radioiodine therapy. Serum $\mathrm{FT}_{4}$ and TSH levels should be monitored regularly. When hypothyroidism develops, prompt replacement with oral levothyroxine, $50-150 \mathrm{mcg}$ daily, should be instituted.

\section*{ADJ UNCTS TO ANTITHYROID THERAPY}

During the acute phase of thyrotoxicosis, B-adrenoceptor blocking agents without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity are extremely helpful. Propranolol, $20-40 \mathrm{mg}$ orally every 6 hours, will control tachycardia, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Propranolol is gradually withdrawn as serum thyroxine levels return to normal. Diltiazem, $90-120 \mathrm{mg}$ three or four times daily, can be used to control tachycardia in patients in whom Bblockers are contraindicated, eg, those with asthma. Other calcium channel blockers may not be as effective as diltiazem. Adequate nutrition and vitamin supplements are essential. Barbiturates accelerate $T_{4}$ breakdown (by hepatic enzyme induction) and may be helpful both as sedatives and to lower $T_{4}$ levels.

\section*{Toxic Uninodular Goiter \& Toxic Multinodular Goiter}

These forms of hyperthyroidism occur often in older women with nodular goiters. $\mathrm{FT}_{4}$ is moderately elevated or occasionally normal, but $\mathrm{FT}_{3}$ or $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is strikingly elevated. Single toxic adenomas can be managed with either surgical excision of the adenoma or with radioiodine therapy. Toxic multinodular goiter is usually associated with a large goiter and is best treated by preparation with methimazole or propylthiouracil followed by subtotal thyroidectomy.

\section*{Subacute Thyroiditis}

During the acute phase of a viral infection of the thyroid gland, there is destruction of thyroid parenchyma with transient release of stored thyroid hormones. A similar state may occur in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. These episodes of transient thyrotoxicosis have been termed spontaneously resolving hyperthyroidism. Supportive therapy is usually all that is necessary, such as $B$ -adrenoceptor blocking agents without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (eg, propranolol) for tachycardia and aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to control local pain and fever. Corticosteroids may be necessary in severe cases to control the inflammation.

\section*{Special Problems}

\section*{Thyroid Storm}

Thyroid storm, or thyrotoxic crisis, is sudden acute exacerbation of all of the symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, presenting as a life-threatening syndrome. Vigorous management is mandatory. Propranolol, $1-2 \mathrm{mg}$ slowly intravenously or $40-80 \mathrm{mg}$ orally every 6 hours, is helpful to control the severe cardiovascular manifestations. If propranolol is contraindicated by the presence of severe heart failure or asthma, hypertension and tachycardia may be controlled with diltiazem, $90-120 \mathrm{mg}$ orally three or four times daily or $5-10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{h}$ by intravenous infusion (asthmatic patients only). Release of thyroid hormones from the gland is retarded by the administration of saturated solution of potassium iodide, 10 drops orally daily, or iodinated contrast media, 1 g orally daily. The latter medication will
also block peripheral conversion of $T_{4}$ to $T_{3}$. Hormone synthesis is blocked by the administration of propylthiouracil, 250 mg orally every 6 hours. If the patient is unable to take propylthiouracil by mouth, a rectal formulation* can be prepared and administered in a dosage of 400 mg every 6 hours as a retention enema. Methimazole may also be prepared for rectal administration in a dose of 60 mg daily. Hydrocortisone, 50 mg intravenously every 6 hours, will protect the patient against shock and will block the conversion of $T_{4}$ to $T_{3}$, rapidly bringing down the level of thyroactive material in the blood.

Supportive therapy is essential to control fever, heart failure, and any underlying disease process that may have precipitated the acute storm. In rare situations, where the above methods are not adequate to control the problem, plasmapheresis or peritoneal dialysis has been used to lower the levels of circulating thyroxine.
*To prepare a water suspension propylthiouracil enema, grind eight 50 mg tablets and suspend the powder in 90 mL of sterile water.

\section*{Ophthalmopathy}

Although severe ophthalmopathy is rare, it is difficult to treat. Management requires effective treatment of the thyroid disease, usually by total surgical excision or ${ }^{131}$ ablation of the gland plus oral prednisone therapy (see below). In addition, local therapy may be necessary, eg, elevation of the head to diminish periorbital edema and artificial tears to relieve corneal drying. Smoking cessation should be advised to prevent progression of the ophthalmopathy. For the severe, acute inflammatory reaction, a short course of prednisone, $60-100 \mathrm{mg}$ orally daily for about a week and then $60-100 \mathrm{mg}$ every other day, tapering the dose over a period of 6-12 weeks, may be effective. If steroid therapy fails or is contraindicated, irradiation of the posterior orbit, using well-collimated high-energy x-ray therapy, will frequently result in marked improvement of the acute process. Threatened loss of vision is an indication for surgical decompression of the orbit. Eyelid or eye muscle surgery may be necessary to correct residual problems after the acute process has subsided.

\section*{Dermopathy}

Dermopathy or pretibial myxedema will often respond to topical corticosteroids applied to the involved area and covered with an occlusive dressing.

\section*{Thyrotoxicosis during Pregnancy}

Ideally, women in the childbearing period with severe disease should have definitive therapy with ${ }^{131}$ I or subtotal thyroidectomy prior to pregnancy in order to avoid an acute exacerbation of the disease during pregnancy or following delivery. If thyrotoxicosis does develop during pregnancy, radioiodine is contraindicated because it crosses the placenta and may injure the fetal thyroid. In the first trimester, the patient can be prepared with propylthiouracil and a subtotal thyroidectomy performed safely during the mid trimester. It is essential to give the patient a thyroid supplement during the balance of the pregnancy. However, most patients are treated with propylthiouracil during the pregnancy, and the decision regarding long-term management can be made after delivery. The dosage of propylthiouracil must be kept to the minimum necessary for control of the disease (ie, $<300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ), because it may affect the function of the fetal thyroid gland. Methimazole is a potential alternative, although there is concern about a possible risk of fetal scalp defects.

\section*{Neonatal Graves' Disease}

Graves' disease may occur in the newborn infant, either due to passage of maternal TSH-R Ab [stim] through the placenta, stimulating the thyroid gland of the neonate, or to genetic transmission of the trait to the fetus. Laboratory studies reveal an elevated free thyroxine, a markedly elevated $T_{3}$, and $a$ low TSH-in contrast to the normal infant, in whom TSH is elevated at birth. TSH-R Ab [stim] is usually found in the serum of both the child and the mother.

If caused by maternal TSH-R Ab [stim], the disease is usually self-limited and subsides over a period of 4-12 weeks, coinciding with the fall in the infant's TSH-R Ab [stim] level. However, treatment is necessary because of the severe metabolic stress the infant experiences. Therapy includes propylthiouracil in a dose of $5-10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in divided doses at 8 -hour intervals; Lugol's solution ( 8 mg of iodide per drop), 1 drop every 8 hours; and propranolol, $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in divided doses. Careful supportive therapy is essential. If the infant is very ill, oral prednisone, $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in divided doses, will help block conversion of $T_{4}$ to $T_{3}$. These medications are gradually reduced as the clinical picture improves and can be discontinued by 6-12 weeks.

\section*{Subclinical Hyperthyroidism}

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a suppressed TSH level (below the normal range) in conjunction with normal thyroid hormone levels. Cardiac toxicity (eg, atrial fibrillation), especially in older persons, is of greatest concern. The consensus of thyroid experts concluded that hyperthyroidism treatment is appropriate in those with TSH less than $0.1 \mathrm{mU} / \mathrm{L}$, while close monitoring of the TSH level is appropriate for those with less TSH suppression.

\section*{Amiodarone-I nduced Thyrotoxicosis}

Approximately 3\% of patients receiving amiodarone will develop hyperthyroidism. Two types of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis have been reported: iodine-induced (type I), which often occurs in persons with underlying thyroid disease (eg, multinodular goiter); and an inflammatory thyroiditis (type II) that occurs in patients without thyroid disease due to leakage of thyroid hormone into the circulation. Treatment of type I requires thioamides while type II responds best to glucocorticoids. Since it is not always possible to differentiate between the two types, thioamides and glucocorticoids are often administered together. If possible, amiodarone should be discontinued; however, rapid improvement does not occur due to its long half-life.

\section*{NONTOXIC GOITER}

Nontoxic goiter is a syndrome of thyroid enlargement without excessive thyroid hormone production. Enlargement of the thyroid gland is often due to TSH stimulation from inadequate thyroid hormone synthesis. The most common cause of nontoxic goiter worldwide is iodide deficiency, but in the USA, it is Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Other causes include germline or acquired mutations in genes involved in hormone synthesis, dietary goitrogens, and neoplasms (see below).

Goiter due to iodide deficiency is best managed by prophylactic administration of iodide. The optimal daily iodide intake is 150-200 mcg. Iodized salt and iodate used as preservatives in flour and bread are excellent sources of iodine in the diet. In areas where it is difficult to introduce iodized salt or iodate preservatives, a solution of iodized poppyseed oil has been administered intramuscularly to provide a long-term source of inorganic iodine.

Goiter due to ingestion of goitrogens in the diet is managed by elimination of the goitrogen or by adding sufficient thyroxine to shut off TSH stimulation. Similarly, in Hashimoto's thyroiditis and dyshormonogenesis, adequate thyroxine therapy- $150-200 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{d}$ orally-will suppress pituitary TSH and result in slow regression of the goiter as well as correction of hypothyroidism.

\section*{THYROID NEOPLASMS}

Neoplasms of the thyroid gland may be benign (adenomas) or malignant. The primary diagnostic test is a fine needle aspiration biopsy and cytologic examination. Benign lesions may be monitored for growth or symptoms of local obstruction, which would mandate surgical excision. Management of thyroid carcinoma requires a total thyroidectomy, postoperative radioiodine therapy in selected instances, and lifetime replacement with levothyroxine. The evaluation for recurrence of some thyroid malignancies often involves withdrawal of thyroxine replacement for 4-6 weeks-accompanied by the development of hypothyroidism. Tumor recurrence is likely if there is a rise in serum thyroglobulin (ie, a tumor marker) or a positive ${ }^{131}$ I scan when TSH is elevated. Alternatively, administration of recombinant human TSH (Thyrogen) can produce comparable TSH elevations without discontinuing thyroxine and avoiding hypothyroidism. Recombinant human TSH is administered intramuscularly once daily for 2 days. A rise in serum thyroglobulin or a positive ${ }^{131}$ I scan will indicate a recurrence of the thyroid cancer.

\section*{ADRENOCORTI COSTEROI DS \& ADRENOCORTI CAL ANTAGONI STS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

The natural adrenocortical hormones are steroid molecules produced and released by the adrenal cortex. Both natural and synthetic corticosteroids are used for diagnosis and treatment of disorders of adrenal function. They are also used-more often and in much larger doses-for treatment of a variety of inflammatory and immunologic disorders.

Secretion of adrenocortical steroids is controlled by the pituitary release of corticotropin (ACTH). Secretion of the salt-retaining hormone aldosterone is primarily under the influence of angiotensin. Corticotropin has some actions that do not depend upon its effect on adrenocortical secretion. However, its pharmacologic value as an anti-inflammatory agent and its use in testing adrenal function depend on its secretory action. Its pharmacology is discussed in Chapter 37 and will be reviewed only briefly here.

Inhibitors of the synthesis or antagonists of the action of the adrenocortical steroids are important in the treatment of several conditions. These agents are described at the end of this chapter.

\section*{ADRENOCORTI COSTEROI DS}

The adrenal cortex releases a large number of steroids into the circulation. Some have minimal biologic activity and function primarily as precursors, and there are some for which no function has been established. The hormonal steroids may be classified as those having important effects on intermediary metabolism and immune function (glucocorticoids), those having principally salt-retaining activity (mineralocorticoids), and those having androgenic or estrogenic activity (see Chapter 40). In humans, the major glucocorticoid is cortisol and the most important mineralocorticoid is aldosterone. Quantitatively, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in its sulfated form (DHEAS) is the major adrenal androgen, since about 20 mg is secreted daily. However, DHEA and two other adrenal androgens, androstenediol and androstenedione, are weak androgens or (by conversion) estrogens. Adrenal androgens constitute the major endogenous precursors of estrogen in women after menopause and in younger patients in whom ovarian function is deficient or absent.

\section*{THE NATURALLY OCCURRI NG GLUCOCORTI COI DS; CORTI SOL (HYDROCORTI SONE)}

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Cortisol (also called hydrocortisone, compound F) exerts a wide range of physiologic effects, including regulation of intermediary metabolism, cardiovascular function, growth, and immunity. Its synthesis and secretion are tightly regulated by the central nervous system, which is very sensitive to negative feedback by the circulating cortisol and exogenous (synthetic) glucocorticoids. Cortisol is synthesized from cholesterol (as shown in Figure 39-1). The mechanisms controlling its secretion are discussed in Chapter 37.
Figure 39-1.

In the normal adult, in the absence of stress, $10-20 \mathrm{mg}$ of cortisol is secreted daily. The rate of secretion follows a circadian rhythm governed by pulses of ACTH that peak in the early morning hours and after meals (Figure 39-2). In plasma, cortisol is bound to circulating proteins. Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), an a. 2 globulin synthesized by the liver, binds about $90 \%$ of the circulating hormone under normal circumstances.

The remainder is free (about 5-10\%) or loosely bound to albumin (about 5\%) and is available to exert its effect on target cells. When plasma cortisol levels exceed $20-30 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$, CBG is saturated, and the concentration of free cortisol rises rapidly. CBG is increased in pregnancy and with estrogen administration and in hyperthyroidism. It is decreased by hypothyroidism, genetic defects in synthesis, and protein deficiency states. Albumin has a large capacity but low affinity for cortisol, and for practical purposes albumin-bound cortisol should be considered free. Synthetic corticosteroids such as dexamethasone are largely bound to albumin rather than CBG.

Fluctuations in plasma ACTH and glucocorticoids throughout the day in a normal girl (age 16). The ACTH was measured by immunoassay and the glucocorticoids as 11-oxysteroids ( 11-OHCS). Note the marked ACTH and glucocorticoid rises in the morning, before awakening from sleep.

The half-life of cortisol in the circulation is normally about 60-90 minutes; half-life may be increased when hydrocortisone (the pharmaceutical preparation of cortisol) is administered in large amounts or when stress, hypothyroidism, or liver disease is present. Only 1\% of cortisol is excreted unchanged in the urine as free
cortisol; about 20\% of cortisol is converted to cortisone by 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the kidney and other tissues with mineralocorticoid receptors (see below) before reaching the liver. Most cortisol is metabolized in the liver. About one third of the cortisol produced daily is excreted in the urine as dihydroxy ketone metabolites and is measured as 17-hydroxysteroids (see Figure 39-3 for carbon numbering). Many cortisol metabolites are conjugated with glucuronic acid or sulfate at the $\mathrm{C}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{21}$ hydroxyls, respectively, in the liver; they are then excreted in the urine.

Chemical structures of several glucocorticoids. The acetonide-substituted derivatives (eg, triamcinolone acetonide) have increased surface activity and are useful in dermatology. Dexamethasone is identical to betamethasone except for the configuration of the methyl group at $\mathrm{C}_{16}$ : in betamethasone it is beta (projecting up from the plane of the rings); in dexamethasone it is alpha.

In some species (eg, the rat), corticosterone is the major glucocorticoid. It is less firmly bound to protein and therefore metabolized more rapidly. The pathways of its degradation are similar to those of cortisol.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

\section*{MECHANI SM OF ACTION}

Most of the known effects of the glucocorticoids are mediated by widely distributed glucocorticoid receptors. These proteins are members of the superfamily of nuclear receptors that includes steroid, sterol (vitamin D), thyroid, retinoic acid, and many other receptors with unknown or nonexistent ligands (orphan receptors). All these receptors interact with the promoters of-and regulate the transcription of-target genes (Figure

39-4). In the absence of the hormonal ligand, glucocorticoid receptors are primarily cytoplasmic, in oligomeric complexes with heat shock proteins (Hsp). The most important of these are two molecules of Hsp90, although other proteins are certainly involved. Free hormone from the plasma and interstitial fluid enters the cell and binds to the receptor, inducing conformational changes that allow it to dissociate from the heat shock proteins. The ligand-bound receptor complex then is actively transported into the nucleus, where it interacts with DNA and nuclear proteins. As a homodimer, it binds to glucocorticoid receptor elements (GRE) in the promoters of responsive genes. The GRE is composed of two palindromic sequences that bind to the hormone receptor dimer.
Figure 39-4.

A model of the interaction of a steroid, S (eg, cortisol), and its receptor, R , and the subsequent events in a target cell. The steroid is present in the blood in bound form on the corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) but enters the cell as the free molecule. The intracellular receptor is bound to stabilizing proteins, including two molecules of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and several others, denoted as "X" in the figure. This receptor complex is incapable of activating transcription. When the complex binds a molecule of cortisol, an unstable complex is created and the Hsp90 and associated molecules are released. The steroid-receptor complex is able to enter the nucleus, bind to the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) on the gene, and regulate transcription by RNA polymerase II and associated transcription factors. A variety of regulatory factors (not shown) may participate in facilitating (coactivators) or inhibiting (corepressors) the steroid response. The resulting mRNA is edited and exported to the cytoplasm for the production of protein that brings about the final hormone
response.

In addition to binding to GREs, the ligand-bound receptor also forms complexes with and influences the function of other transcription factors, such as AP1 and NF-kB, which act on non-GRE-containing promoters, to contribute to the regulation of transcription of their responsive genes. These transcription factors have broad actions on the regulation of growth factors, proinflammatory cytokines, etc, and to a great extent mediate the anti-growth, anti-inflammatory, and immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids.

Two genes for the corticoid receptor have been identified, one encoding the classic glucocorticoid receptor and the other the mineralocorticoid receptor. Alternative splicing of human glucocorticoid receptor pre-mRNA generates two highly homologous isoforms, termed hGR alpha and hGR beta. hGR alpha is the classic ligandactivated glucocorticoid receptor which, in the hormone-bound state, modulates the expression of glucocorticoid-responsive genes. In contrast, hGR beta does not bind glucocorticoids and is transcriptionally inactive. However, hGR beta is able to inhibit the effects of hormone-activated hGR alpha on glucocorticoidresponsive genes, playing the role of a physiologically relevant endogenous inhibitor of glucocorticoid action.

The glucocorticoid receptor is composed of about 800 amino acids and can be divided into three functional domains (see Figure 2-6). The glucocorticoid-binding domain is located at the carboxyl terminal of the molecule and is the area where free glucocorticoids bind. The DNA-binding domain is located in the middle of the protein and contains nine cysteine residues. This region folds into a "two-finger" structure stabilized by zinc ions connected to cysteines to form two tetrahedrons. This part of the molecule binds to the GREs that regulate glucocorticoid action on glucocorticoid-regulated genes. The zinc-fingers represent the basic structure by which the DNA-binding domain recognizes specific nucleic acid sequences. The amino-terminal domain is involved in the transactivation activity of the receptor and increases its specificity.

The interaction of glucocorticoid receptors with GREs or other transcription factors is facilitated or inhibited by several families of proteins called steroid receptor coregulators, divided into coactivators and corepressors. The coregulators do this by serving as bridges between the receptors and other nuclear proteins and by expressing enzymatic activities such as histone acetylase or deacetylase that alter the conformation of nucleosomes and the transcribability of genes.

Between $10 \%$ and $20 \%$ of expressed genes in a cell are regulated by glucocorticoids. The number and affinity of receptors for the hormone, the complement of transcription factors and coregulators, and posttranscription events determine the relative specificity of these hormones' actions in various cells. The effects of glucocorticoids are mainly due to proteins synthesized from mRNA transcribed by their target genes.

Some of the effects of glucocorticoids can be attributed to their binding to aldosterone receptors (ARs). Indeed, ARs bind aldosterone and cortisol with similar affinity. A mineralocorticoid effect of cortisol is avoided in some tissues by expression of 11 B -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 , the enzyme responsible for biotransformation to its 11-keto derivative (cortisone), which has minimal affinity for aldosterone receptors.

Prompt effects such as initial feedback suppression of pituitary ACTH occur in minutes and are too rapid to be explained on the basis of gene transcription and protein synthesis. It is not known how these effects are mediated. Among the proposed mechanisms are direct effects on cell membrane receptors for the hormone or nongenomic effects of the classic hormone-bound glucocorticoid receptor. The putative membrane receptors might be entirely different from the known intracellular receptors.

\section*{PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS}

The glucocorticoids have widespread effects because they influence the function of most cells in the body. The major metabolic consequences of glucocorticoid secretion or administration are due to direct actions of these hormones in the cell. However, some important effects are the result of homeostatic responses by insulin and glucagon. Although many of the effects of glucocorticoids are dose-related and become magnified when large amounts are administered for therapeutic purposes, there are also other effects-called permissive effects-in the absence of which many normal functions become deficient. For example, the response of vascular and bronchial smooth muscle to catecholamines is diminished in the absence of cortisol and restored by physiologic amounts of this glucocorticoid. Furthermore, the lipolytic responses of fat cells to catecholamines, ACTH, and growth hormone are attenuated in the absence of glucocorticoids.

\section*{METABOLIC EFFECTS}

The glucocorticoids have important dose-related effects on carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism. The same effects are responsible for some of the serious adverse effects associated with their use in therapeutic doses. Glucocorticoids stimulate and are required for gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis in the fasting state. They stimulate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and glycogen synthase and the release of amino acids in the course of muscle catabolism.

Glucocorticoids increase serum glucose levels and thus stimulate insulin release and inhibit the uptake of glucose by muscle cells, while they stimulate hormone-sensitive lipase and thus lipolysis. The increased insulin secretion stimulates lipogenesis and to a lesser degree inhibits lipolysis, leading to a net increase in fat deposition combined with increased release of fatty acids and glycerol into the circulation.

The net results of these actions are most apparent in the fasting state, when the supply of glucose from gluconeogenesis, the release of amino acids from muscle catabolism, the inhibition of peripheral glucose uptake, and the stimulation of lipolysis all contribute to maintenance of an adequate glucose supply to the brain.

\section*{CATABOLIC AND ANTI ANABOLIC EFFECTS}

Although glucocorticoids stimulate RNA and protein synthesis in the liver, they have catabolic and antianabolic effects in lymphoid and connective tissue, muscle, peripheral fat, and skin. Supraphysiologic amounts of glucocorticoids lead to decreased muscle mass and weakness and thinning of the skin. Catabolic and antianabolic effects on bone are the cause of osteoporosis in Cushing's syndrome and impose a major limitation in the long-term therapeutic use of glucocorticoids. In children, glucocorticoids reduce growth. This effect may be partially prevented by administration of growth hormone in high doses.

\section*{ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE EFFECTS}

Glucocorticoids dramatically reduce the manifestations of inflammation. This is due to their profound effects on the concentration, distribution, and function of peripheral leukocytes and to their suppressive effects on the inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and on other mediators of inflammation. Inflammation, regardless of its cause, is characterized by the extravasation and infiltration of leukocytes into the affected tissue. These events are mediated by a complex series of interactions of white cell adhesion molecules with those on endothelial cells and are inhibited by glucocorticoids. After a single dose of a short-acting glucocorticoid, the concentration of neutrophils in the circulation increases while the lymphocytes (T and B cells), monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils decrease. The changes are maximal at 6 hours and are dissipated in 24 hours. The increase in neutrophils is due both to the increased influx into the blood from the bone marrow and decreased migration from the blood vessels, leading to a reduction in the number of cells at the site of inflammation. The reduction in circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils is
primarily the result of their movement from the vascular bed to lymphoid tissue.
Glucocorticoids also inhibit the functions of tissue macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells. The ability of these cells to respond to antigens and mitogens is reduced. The effect on macrophages is particularly marked and limits their ability to phagocytose and kill microorganisms and to produce tumor necrosis factor-a. , interleukin-1, metalloproteinases, and plasminogen activator. Both macrophages and lymphocytes produce less interleukin-12 and interferon- $\gamma$, important inducers of Th 1 cell activity, and cellular immunity.
In addition to their effects on leukocyte function, glucocorticoids influence the inflammatory response by reducing the prostaglandin, leukotriene, and platelet-activating factor synthesis that results from activation of phospholipase $A_{2}$. Finally, glucocorticoids reduce expression of cyclooxygenase-2, the inducible form of this enzyme, in inflammatory cells, thus reducing the amount of enzyme available to produce prostaglandins (see Chapters 18 and 36).

Glucocorticoids cause vasoconstriction when applied directly to the skin, possibly by suppressing mast cell degranulation. They also decrease capillary permeability by reducing the amount of histamine released by basophils and mast cells.

The anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids are largely due to the actions described above. In humans, complement activation is unaltered, but its effects are inhibited. Antibody production can be reduced by large doses of steroids, though it is unaffected by moderate dosages (eg, 20 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ of prednisone).

The anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of these agents are widely useful therapeutically but are also responsible for some of their most serious adverse effects (see below).

\section*{OTHER EFFECTS}

Glucocorticoids have important effects on the nervous system. Adrenal insufficiency causes marked slowing of the alpha rhythm of the electroencephalogram and is associated with depression. Increased amounts of glucocorticoids often produce behavioral disturbances in humans: initially insomnia and euphoria and subsequently depression. Large doses of glucocorticoids may increase intracranial pressure (pseudotumor cerebri).

Glucocorticoids given chronically suppress the pituitary release of ACTH, growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone.

Large doses of glucocorticoids have been associated with the development of peptic ulcer, possibly by suppressing the local immune response against Helicobacter pylori. They also promote fat redistribution in the body, with increase of visceral, facial, nuchal, and supraclavicular fat, and they appear to antagonize the effect of vitamin D on calcium absorption. The glucocorticoids also have important effects on the hematopoietic system. In addition to their effects on leukocytes described above, they increase the number of platelets and red blood cells.

In the absence of physiologic amounts of cortisol, renal function (particularly glomerular filtration) is impaired, vasopressin secretion is augmented, and there is an inability to excrete a water load normally.

Glucocorticoids have important effects on the development of the fetal lungs. Indeed, the structural and functional changes in the lungs near term, including the production of pulmonary surface-active material required for air breathing (surfactant), are stimulated by glucocorticoids.

\section*{SYNTHETI C CORTI COSTEROI DS}

Glucocorticoids have become important agents for use in the treatment of many inflammatory, immunologic, hematologic, and other disorders. This has stimulated the development of many synthetic steroids with antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive activity.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

\section*{SOURCE}

Pharmaceutical steroids are usually synthesized from cholic acid obtained from cattle or steroid sapogenins found in plants. Further modifications of these steroids have led to the marketing of a large group of synthetic steroids with special characteristics that are pharmacologically and therapeutically important (Table 39-1; Figure 39-3).

\section*{DISPOSITION}

The metabolism of the naturally occurring adrenal steroids has been discussed above. The synthetic corticosteroids (Table 39-1) are in most cases rapidly and completely absorbed when given by mouth. Although they are transported and metabolized in a fashion similar to that of the endogenous steroids, important differences exist.

Alterations in the glucocorticoid molecule influence its affinity for glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors as well as its protein-binding affinity, side chain stability, rate of elimination, and metabolic products. Halogenation at the 9 position, unsaturation of the $\Delta 1-2$ bond of the A ring, and methylation at the 2 or 16 position prolong the half-life by more than $50 \%$. The $\Delta 1$ compounds are excreted in the free form. In some cases, the agent given is a prodrug; for example, prednisone is rapidly converted to the active product prednisolone in the body.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

The actions of the synthetic steroids are similar to those of cortisol (see above). They bind to the specific intracellular receptor proteins and produce the same effects but have different ratios of glucocorticoid to mineralocorticoid potency (Table 39-1).

\section*{Clinical Pharmacology}

\section*{DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF DISTURBED ADRENAL FUNCTION Adrenocortical Insufficiency \\ CHRONIC (ADDISON'S DISEASE)}

Chronic adrenocortical insufficiency is characterized by weakness, fatigue, weight loss, hypotension, hyperpigmentation, and inability to maintain the blood glucose level during fasting. In such individuals, minor noxious, traumatic, or infectious stimuli may produce acute adrenal insufficiency with circulatory shock and even death.

In primary adrenal insufficiency, about $20-30 \mathrm{mg}$ of hydrocortisone must be given daily, with increased
amounts during periods of stress. Although hydrocortisone has some mineralocorticoid activity, this must be supplemented by an appropriate amount of a salt-retaining hormone such as fludrocortisone. Synthetic glucocorticoids that are long-acting and devoid of salt-retaining activity should not be administered to these patients.

\section*{ACUTE}

When acute adrenocortical insufficiency is suspected, treatment must be instituted immediately. Therapy consists of correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities and treatment of precipitating factors in addition to large amounts of parenteral hydrocortisone.

Hydrocortisone sodium succinate or phosphate in doses of 100 mg intravenously is given every 8 hours until the patient is stable. The dose is then gradually reduced, achieving maintenance dosage within 5 days. The administration of salt-retaining hormone is resumed when the total hydrocortisone dosage has been reduced to $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$.

\section*{Adrenocortical Hypo- and Hyperfunction}

\section*{CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA}

This group of disorders is characterized by specific defects in the synthesis of cortisol. In pregnancies at high risk for congenital adrenal hyperplasia, fetuses can be protected from genital abnormalities by administration of dexamethasone to the mother. The most common defect is a decrease in or lack of P450c21 (21Bhydroxylase) activity.*

As can be seen in Figure 39-1, this would lead to a reduction in cortisol synthesis and thus produce a compensatory increase in ACTH release. The gland becomes hyperplastic and produces abnormally large amounts of precursors such as 17-hydroxyprogesterone that can be diverted to the androgen pathway, leading to virilization. Metabolism of this compound in the liver leads to pregnanetriol, which is characteristically excreted into the urine in large amounts in this disorder and can be used to make the diagnosis and to monitor efficacy of glucocorticoid substitution. However, the most reliable method of detecting this disorder is the increased response of plasma 17-hydroxyprogesterone to ACTH stimulation.

If the defect is in 11-hydroxylation, large amounts of deoxycorticosterone are produced, and because this steroid has mineralocorticoid activity, hypertension with or without hypokalemic alkalosis ensues. When 17hydroxylation is defective in the adrenals and gonads, hypogonadism is also present. However, increased amounts of 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC; see page 647) are formed, and the signs and symptoms associated with mineralocorticoid excessâsuch as hypertension and hypokalemiaâare also observed.

When first seen, the infant with congenital adrenal hyperplasia may be in acute adrenal crisis and should be treated as described above, using appropriate electrolyte solutions and an intravenous preparation of hydrocortisone in stress doses.

Once the patient is stabilized, oral hydrocortisone, $12-18 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{m}^{2} / \mathrm{d}$ in two unequally divided doses (two thirds in the morning, one third in late afternoon) is begun. The dosage is adjusted to allow normal growth and bone maturation and to prevent androgen excess. Alternate-day therapy with prednisone has also been used to achieve greater ACTH suppression without increasing growth inhibition. Fludrocortisone, 0.05-0.2 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, should also be administered by mouth, with added salt to maintain normal blood pressure, plasma renin activity, and electrolytes.
* Names for the adrenal steroid synthetic enzymes include the following: P450c11 (11B-hydroxylase) P450c17 (17a-hydroxylase) P450c21 (21B-hydroxylase)

\section*{CUSHING'S SYNDROME}

Cushing's syndrome is usually the result of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia secondary to an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma (Cushing's disease) but occasionally is due to tumors or nodular hyperplasia of the adrenal gland or ectopic production of ACTH by other tumors. The manifestations are those associated with the chronic presence of excessive glucocorticoids. When glucocorticoid hypersecretion is marked and prolonged, a rounded, plethoric face and trunk obesity are striking in appearance. The manifestations of protein loss are often found and include muscle wasting, thinning, purple striae, and easy bruising of the skin; poor wound healing; and osteoporosis. Other serious disturbances include mental disorders, hypertension, and diabetes. This disorder is treated by surgical removal of the tumor producing ACTH or cortisol, irradiation of the pituitary tumor, or resection of one or both adrenals. These patients must receive large doses of cortisol during and following the surgical procedure. Doses of up to 300 mg of soluble hydrocortisone may be given as a continuous intravenous infusion on the day of surgery. The dose must be reduced slowly to normal replacement levels, since rapid reduction in dose may produce withdrawal symptoms, including fever and joint pain. If adrenalectomy has been performed, long-term maintenance is similar to that outlined above for adrenal insufficiency.

\section*{ALDOSTERONISM}

Primary aldosteronism usually results from the excessive production of aldosterone by an adrenal adenoma. However, it may also result from abnormal secretion by hyperplastic glands or from a malignant tumor. The clinical findings of hypertension, weakness, and tetany are related to the continued renal loss of potassium, which leads to hypokalemia, alkalosis, and elevation of serum sodium concentrations. This syndrome can also be produced in disorders of adrenal steroid biosynthesis by excessive secretion of deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, or 18-hydroxycorticosterone-all compounds with inherent mineralocorticoid activity.

In contrast to patients with secondary aldosteronism (see below), these patients have low (suppressed) levels of plasma renin activity and angiotensin II. When treated with fludrocortisone ( 0.2 mg twice daily orally for 3 days) or deoxycorticosterone acetate ( $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ intramuscularly for 3 days-but not available in the USA), they fail to retain sodium and their secretion of aldosterone is not significantly reduced. When the disorder is mild, it may escape detection when serum potassium levels are used for screening. However, it may be detected by an increased ratio of plasma aldosterone to renin. Patients generally improve when treated with spironolactone, and the response to this agent is of diagnostic and therapeutic value.

\section*{Use of Glucocorticoids for Diagnostic Purposes}

It is sometimes necessary to suppress the production of ACTH in order to identify the source of a particular hormone or to establish whether its production is influenced by the secretion of ACTH. In these circumstances, it is advantageous to employ a very potent substance such as dexamethasone because the use of small quantities reduces the possibility of confusion in the interpretation of hormone assays in blood or urine. For example, if complete suppression is achieved by the use of 50 mg of cortisol, the urinary 17hydroxycorticosteroids will be $15-18 \mathrm{mg} / 24 \mathrm{~h}$, since one third of the dose given will be recovered in urine as 17-hydroxycorticosteroid. If an equivalent dose of 1.5 mg of dexamethasone is employed, the urinary excretion will be only $0.5 \mathrm{mg} / 24 \mathrm{~h}$ and blood levels will be low.

The dexamethasone suppression test is used for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome and has also been used in the differential diagnosis of depressive psychiatric states. As a screening test, dexamethasone, 1 mg , is given orally at 11 PM, and a plasma sample is obtained the following morning. In normal individuals, the morning cortisol concentration is usually less than $3 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$, whereas in Cushing's syndrome the level is
usually greater than $5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$. The results are not reliable in the presence of depression, anxiety, concurrent illness, and other stressful conditions or if the patient receives a medication that enhances the catabolism of dexamethasone in the liver. To distinguish between hypercortisolism due to anxiety, depression, and alcoholism (pseudo-Cushing syndrome) and bona fide Cushing's syndrome, a combined test is carried out, consisting of dexamethasone ( 0.5 mg orally every 6 hours for 2 days) followed by a standard corticotropinreleasing hormone (CRH) test ( $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ given as a bolus intravenous infusion 2 hours after the last dose of dexamethasone).

In patients in whom the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome has been established clinically and confirmed by a finding of elevated free cortisol in the urine, suppression with large doses of dexamethasone will help to distinguish patients with Cushing's disease from those with steroid-producing tumors of the adrenal cortex or with the ectopic ACTH syndrome. Dexamethasone is given in a dosage of 0.5 mg orally every 6 hours for 2 days, followed by 2 mg orally every 6 hours for 2 days, and the urine is then assayed for cortisol or its metabolites (Liddle's test); or dexamethasone is given as a single dose of 8 mg at 11 PM and the plasma cortisol is measured at 8 AM the following day. In patients with Cushing's disease, the suppressant effect of dexamethasone will usually produce a $50 \%$ reduction in hormone levels. In patients in whom suppression does not occur, the ACTH level will be low in the presence of a cortisol-producing adrenal tumor and elevated in patients with an ectopic ACTH-producing tumor.

\section*{CORTICOSTEROIDS AND STIMULATION OF LUNG MATURATION IN THE FETUS}

Lung maturation in the fetus is regulated by the fetal secretion of cortisol. Treatment of the mother with large doses of glucocorticoid reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in infants delivered prematurely. When delivery is anticipated before 34 weeks of gestation, intramuscular betamethasone, 12 mg , followed by an additional dose of $12 \mathrm{mg} 18-24$ hours later, is commonly used. Betamethasone is chosen because maternal protein binding and placental metabolism of this corticosteroid is less than that of cortisol, allowing increased transfer across the placenta to the fetus.

\section*{CORTICOSTEROIDS AND NONADRENAL DISORDERS}

The synthetic analogs of cortisol are useful in the treatment of a diverse group of diseases unrelated to any known disturbance of adrenal function (Table 39-2). The usefulness of corticosteroids in these disorders is a function of their ability to suppress inflammatory and immune responses and to alter leukocyte function, as described above and in Chapter 56. In disorders in which host response is the cause of the major manifestations of the disease, these agents are useful. In instances where the inflammatory or immune response is important in controlling the pathologic process, therapy with corticosteroids may be dangerous but justified to prevent irreparable damage from an inflammatory response-if used in conjunction with specific therapy for the disease process.

Since the corticosteroids are not usually curative, the pathologic process may progress while clinical manifestations are suppressed. Therefore, chronic therapy with these drugs should be undertaken with great care and only when the seriousness of the disorder warrants their use and less hazardous measures have been exhausted.

In general, attempts should be made to bring the disease process under control using medium- to intermediate-acting glucocorticoids such as prednisone and prednisolone (Table 39-1), as well as all ancillary measures possible to keep the dose low. Where possible, alternate-day therapy should be utilized (see below). Therapy should not be decreased or stopped abruptly. When prolonged therapy is anticipated, it is helpful to obtain chest x-rays and a tuberculin test, since glucocorticoid therapy can reactivate dormant disease. The presence of diabetes, peptic ulcer, osteoporosis, and psychologic disturbances should be taken into consideration, and cardiovascular function should be assessed.

Treatment of transplant rejection is a very important application of glucocorticoids. The efficacy of these agents is based on their ability to reduce antigen expression from the grafted tissue, delay revascularization, and interfere with the sensitization of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and the generation of primary antibodyforming cells.

\section*{Toxicity}

The benefits obtained from use of the glucocorticoids vary considerably. Use of these drugs must be carefully weighed in each patient against their widespread effects on every part of the organism. The major undesirable effects of the glucocorticoids are the result of their hormonal actions (see above), which lead to the clinical picture of iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome (see below).

When the glucocorticoids are used for short periods ( $<2$ weeks), it is unusual to see serious adverse effects even with moderately large doses. However, insomnia, behavioral changes (primarily hypomania), and acute peptic ulcers are occasionally observed even after only a few days of treatment. Acute pancreatitis is a rare but serious acute adverse effect of high-dose glucocorticoids.

\section*{METABOLIC EFFECTS}

Most patients who are given daily doses of 100 mg of hydrocortisone or more (or the equivalent amount of synthetic steroid) for longer than 2 weeks undergo a series of changes that have been termed iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome. The rate of development is a function of the dose and the genetic background of the patient. In the face, rounding, puffiness, fat deposition, and plethora usually appear (moon facies). Similarly, fat tends to be redistributed from the extremities to the trunk, the back of the neck, and the supraclavicular fossae. There is an increased growth of fine hair over the face, thighs and trunk. Steroid-induced punctate acne may appear, and insomnia and increased appetite are noted. In the treatment of dangerous or disabling disorders, these changes may not require cessation of therapy. However, the underlying metabolic changes accompanying them can be very serious by the time they become obvious. The continuing breakdown of protein and diversion of amino acids to glucose production increase the need for insulin and over a period of time result in weight gain; visceral fat deposition; myopathy and muscle wasting; thinning of the skin, with striae and bruising; hyperglycemia; and eventually the development of osteoporosis, diabetes, and aseptic necrosis of the hip. Wound healing is also impaired under these circumstances. When diabetes occurs, it is treated by diet and insulin. These patients are often resistant to insulin but rarely develop ketoacidosis. In general, patients treated with corticosteroids should be on high-protein and potassium-enriched diets.

\section*{OTHER COMPLICATIONS}

Other serious side effects include peptic ulcers and their consequences. The clinical findings associated with certain disorders, particularly bacterial and mycotic infections, may be masked by the corticosteroids, and patients must be carefully watched to avoid serious mishap when large doses are used. The frequency of severe myopathy is greater in patients treated with long-acting glucocorticoids. The administration of such compounds has been associated with nausea, dizziness, and weight loss in some patients. It is treated by changing drugs, reducing dosage, and increasing potassium and protein intake.

Hypomania or acute psychosis may occur, particularly in patients receiving very large doses of corticosteroids. Long-term therapy with intermediate- and long-acting steroids is associated with depression and the development of posterior subcapsular cataracts. Psychiatric follow-up and periodic slit lamp examination is indicated in such patients. Increased intraocular pressure is common, and glaucoma may be induced. Benign intracranial hypertension also occurs. In dosages of $45 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{m}^{2} / \mathrm{d}$ or more of hydrocortisone or its equivalent, growth retardation occurs in children. Medium-, intermediate-, and long-acting glucocorticoids have greater growth-suppressing potency than the natural steroid at equivalent doses.

When given in greater than physiologic amounts, steroids such as cortisone and hydrocortisone, which have mineralocorticoid effects in addition to glucocorticoid effects, cause some sodium and fluid retention and loss of potassium. In patients with normal cardiovascular and renal function, this leads to a hypokalemic, hypochloremic alkalosis and eventually a rise in blood pressure. In patients with hypoproteinemia, renal disease, or liver disease, edema may also occur. In patients with heart disease, even small degrees of sodium retention may lead to heart failure. These effects can be minimized by using synthetic non-saltretaining steroids, sodium restriction, and judicious amounts of potassium supplements.

\section*{ADRENAL SUPPRESSION}

When corticosteroids are administered for more than 2 weeks, adrenal suppression may occur. If treatment extends over weeks to months, the patient should be given appropriate supplementary therapy at times of minor stress (twofold dose increases for 24-48 hours) or severe stress (up to tenfold dose increases for 48-72 hours) such as accidental trauma or major surgery. If corticosteroid dosage is to be reduced, it should be tapered slowly. If therapy is to be stopped, the reduction process should be quite slow when the dose reaches replacement levels. It may take 2-12 months for the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to function acceptably, and cortisol levels may not return to normal for another 6-9 months. The glucocorticoid-induced suppression is not a pituitary problem, and treatment with ACTH does not reduce the time required for the return of normal function.

If the dose is reduced too rapidly in patients receiving glucocorticoids for a certain disorder, the symptoms of the disorder may reappear or increase in intensity. However, patients without an underlying disorder (eg, patients cured surgically of Cushing's disease) will also develop symptoms with rapid reductions in corticosteroid levels. These symptoms include anorexia, nausea or vomiting, weight loss, lethargy, headache, fever, joint or muscle pain, and postural hypotension. Although many of these symptoms may reflect true glucocorticoid deficiency, they may also occur in the presence of normal or even elevated plasma cortisol levels, suggesting glucocorticoid dependence.

\section*{Contraindications \& Cautions}

\section*{SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS}

Patients receiving these drugs must be monitored carefully for the development of hyperglycemia, glycosuria, sodium retention with edema or hypertension, hypokalemia, peptic ulcer, osteoporosis, and hidden infections.

The dosage should be kept as low as possible, and intermittent administration (eg, alternate-day) should be employed when satisfactory therapeutic results can be obtained on this schedule. Even patients maintained on relatively low doses of corticosteroids may require supplementary therapy at times of stress, such as when surgical procedures are performed or intercurrent illness or accidents occur.

\section*{CONTRAI NDI CATI ONS}

These agents must be used with great caution in patients with peptic ulcer, heart disease or hypertension with heart failure, certain infectious illnesses such as varicella and tuberculosis, psychoses, diabetes, osteoporosis, or glaucoma.

\section*{Selection of Drug \& Dosage Schedule}

Since these preparations differ with respect to relative anti-inflammatory and mineralocorticoid effect, duration of action, cost, and dosage forms available (Table 39-1), these factors should be taken into account in selecting the drug to be used.

\section*{ACTH VERSUS ADRENOCORTICAL STEROIDS}

In patients with normal adrenals, ACTH was used to induce the endogenous production of cortisol to obtain similar effects. However, except when the increase in androgens is desirable, the use of ACTH as a therapeutic agent has been abandoned. Instances in which ACTH was claimed to be more effective than glucocorticoids were probably due to the administration of smaller amounts of corticosteroids than were produced by the dosage of ACTH.

\section*{DOSAGE}

In determining the dosage regimen to be used, the physician must consider the seriousness of the disease, the amount of drug likely to be required to obtain the desired effect, and the duration of therapy. In some diseases, the amount required for maintenance of the desired therapeutic effect is less than the dose needed to obtain the initial effect, and the lowest possible dosage for the needed effect should be determined by gradually lowering the dose until a small increase in signs or symptoms is noted.

When it is necessary to maintain continuously elevated plasma corticosteroid levels in order to suppress ACTH, a slowly absorbed parenteral preparation or small oral doses at frequent intervals are required. The opposite situation exists with respect to the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of inflammatory and allergic disorders. The same total quantity given in a few doses may be more effective than when given in many smaller doses or in a slowly absorbed parenteral form.

Severe autoimmune conditions involving vital organs must be treated aggressively, and undertreatment is as dangerous as overtreatment. In order to minimize the deposition of immune complexes and the influx of leukocytes and macrophages, $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ of prednisone in divided doses is required initially. This dose is maintained until the serious manifestations respond. The dose can then be gradually reduced.

When large doses are required for prolonged periods of time, alternate-day administration of the compound may be tried after control is achieved. When used in this manner, very large amounts (eg, 100 mg of prednisone) can sometimes be administered with less marked adverse effects because there is a recovery period between each dose. The transition to an alternate-day schedule can be made after the disease process is under control. It should be done gradually and with additional supportive measures between doses.

When selecting a drug for use in large doses, a medium- or intermediate-acting synthetic steroid with little mineralocorticoid effect is advisable. If possible, it should be given as a single morning dose.

\section*{SPECIAL DOSAGE FORMS}

The use of local therapy, such as topical preparations for skin disease, ophthalmic forms for eye disease, intra-articular injections for joint disease, inhaled steroids for asthma, and hydrocortisone enemas for ulcerative colitis, provides a means of delivering large amounts of steroid to the diseased tissue with reduced systemic effects.

Beclomethasone dipropionate and several other glucocorticoidsâprimarily budesonide and flunisolide and mometasone furoate, administered as aerosols-have been found to be effective in the treatment of asthma (see Chapter 20).

Beclomethasone dipropionate, triamcinolone acetonide, budesonide, flunisolide, and mometasone furoate are available as nasal sprays for the topical treatment of allergic rhinitis. They are effective at doses (one or two sprays one, two, or three times daily) that in most patients result in plasma levels too low to influence adrenal function or have any other systemic effects.

Corticosteroids incorporated in ointments, creams, lotions, and sprays are used extensively in dermatology. These preparations are discussed in more detail in Chapter 62.

\section*{MI NERALOCORTI COI DS (ALDOSTERONE, DEOXYCORTI COSTERONE, FLUDROCORTI SONE)}

The most important mineralocorticoid in humans is aldosterone. However, small amounts of deoxycorticosterone (DOC) are also formed and released. Although the amount is normally insignificant, DOC was of some importance therapeutically in the past. Its actions, effects, and metabolism are qualitatively similar to those described below for aldosterone.

Fludrocortisone, a synthetic corticosteroid, is the most commonly prescribed salt-retaining hormone.

\section*{Aldosterone}

Aldosterone is synthesized mainly in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. Its structure and synthesis are illustrated in Figure 39-1.

The rate of aldosterone secretion is subject to several influences. ACTH produces a moderate stimulation of its release, but this effect is not sustained for more than a few days in the normal individual. Although aldosterone is no less than one third as effective as cortisol in suppressing ACTH, the quantities of aldosterone produced by the adrenal cortex and its plasma concentrations are insufficient to participate in any significant feedback control of ACTH secretion.

In the absence of ACTH, aldosterone secretion falls to about half the normal rate, indicating that other factors, eg, angiotensin, are able to maintain and perhaps regulate its secretion (see Chapter 17). Independent variations between cortisol and aldosterone secretion can also be demonstrated by means of lesions in the nervous system such as decerebration, which decreases the secretion of cortisol while increasing the secretion of aldosterone.

\section*{Physiologic \& Pharmacologic Effects}

Aldosterone and other steroids with mineralocorticoid properties promote the reabsorption of sodium from the distal part of the distal convoluted tubule and from the cortical collecting renal tubules, loosely coupled to the excretion of potassium and hydrogen ion. Sodium reabsorption in the sweat and salivary glands, gastrointestinal mucosa, and across cell membranes in general is also increased. Excessive levels of
aldosterone produced by tumors or overdosage with synthetic mineralocorticoids lead to hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, increased plasma volume, and hypertension.

Mineralocorticoids act by binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor in the cytoplasm of target cells, especially principal cells of the distal convoluted and collecting tubules of the kidney. The drug-receptor complex activates a series of events similar to those described above for the glucocorticoids and illustrated in Figure 39-4. It is of interest that this receptor has the same affinity for cortisol, which is present in much higher concentrations in the extracellular fluid. The specificity for mineralocorticoids at this site appears to be conferred, at least in part, by the presence of the enzyme 11B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, which converts cortisol to cortisone. The latter has low affinity for the receptor and is inactive as a mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid. The major effect of activation of the aldosterone receptor is increased expression of $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ ATPase and the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC).

\section*{Metabolism}

Aldosterone is secreted at the rate of $100-200 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{d}$ in normal individuals with a moderate dietary salt intake. The plasma level in men (resting supine) is about $0.007 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$. The half-life of aldosterone injected in tracer quantities is 15-20 minutes, and it does not appear to be firmly bound to serum proteins.

The metabolism of aldosterone is similar to that of cortisol, about $50 \mathrm{mcg} / 24 \mathrm{~h}$ appearing in the urine as conjugated tetrahydroaldosterone. Approximately $5-15 \mathrm{mcg} / 24 \mathrm{~h}$ is excreted free or as the 3-oxo glucuronide.

\section*{Deoxycorticosterone (DOC)}

DOC, which also serves as a precursor of aldosterone (Figure 39-1), is normally secreted in amounts of about $200 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{d}$. Its half-life when injected into the human circulation is about 70 minutes. Preliminary estimates of its concentration in plasma are approximately $0.03 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$. The control of its secretion differs from that of aldosterone in that the secretion of DOC is primarily under the control of ACTH. Although the response to ACTH is enhanced by dietary sodium restriction, a low-salt diet does not increase DOC secretion. The secretion of DOC may be markedly increased in abnormal conditions such as adrenocortical carcinoma and congenital adrenal hyperplasia with reduced P450c11 or P450c17 activity.

\section*{Fludrocortisone}

This compound, a potent steroid with both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activity, is the most widely used mineralocorticoid. Doses of 0.1 mg two to seven times weekly have potent salt-retaining activity and are used in the treatment of adrenocortical insufficiency associated with mineralocorticoid deficiency. These dosages are too small to have important anti-inflammatory or antigrowth effects.

\section*{ADRENAL ANDROGENS}

The adrenal cortex secretes large amounts of DHEA and smaller amounts of androstenedione and testosterone. Although these androgens are thought to contribute to the normal maturation process, they do not stimulate or support major androgen-dependent pubertal changes in humans. Recent studies suggest that DHEA and its sulfate may have other important physiologic actions. If that is correct, these results are probably due to the peripheral conversion of DHEA to more potent androgens or to estrogens and interaction with androgen and estrogen receptors, respectively. Additional effects may be exerted through an interaction with the GABAA and glutamate receptors in the brain or with a nuclear receptor in several central and peripheral sites. The therapeutic use of DHEA in humans is being explored, but the substance has already
been adopted with uncritical enthusiasm by members of the sports drug culture and the vitamin and food supplement culture. The results of a placebo-controlled trial of DHEA in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were recently reported as well as those of a study of DHEA replacement in women with adrenal insufficiency. In both studies a small beneficial effect was seen, with significant improvement of the disease in the former and a clearly added sense of well-being in the latter. The androgenic or estrogenic actions of DHEA could explain the effects of the compound in both situations.

\section*{ANTAGONI STS OF ADRENOCORTI CAL AGENTS SYNTHESIS INHIBITORS \& GLUCOCORTI COID ANTAGONISTS Metyrapone}

Metyrapone (Figure 39-5) is a relatively selective inhibitor of steroid synthesis. It inhibits 11-hydroxylation, interfering with cortisol and corticosterone synthesis. In the presence of a normal pituitary gland, there is a compensatory increase in pituitary ACTH release and adrenal 11-deoxycortisol secretion. This response is a measure of the capacity of the anterior pituitary to produce ACTH and has been adapted for clinical use as a diagnostic test. Although the toxicity of metyrapone is much lower than that of mitotane (see below), the drug may produce transient dizziness and gastrointestinal disturbances. This agent has not been widely used for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. However, in doses of 0.25 g twice daily to 1 g four times daily, metyrapone can reduce cortisol production to normal levels in some patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome. Thus, it may be useful in the management of severe manifestations of cortisol excess while the cause of this condition is being determined or in conjunction with radiation or surgical treatment. It is the only adrenal-inhibiting medication that can be administered to pregnant women with Cushing's syndrome. The major adverse effects observed are salt and water retention and hirsutism resulting from diversion of the 11deoxycortisol precursor to DOC and androgen synthesis.

Some adrenocortical antagonists. Because of their toxicity, several of these compounds are no longer available in the USA.

Metyrapone is commonly used in tests of adrenal function. The blood levels of 11-deoxycortisol and the urinary excretion of 17-hydroxycorticoids are measured before and after administration of the compound. Normally, there is a twofold or greater increase in the urinary 17-hydroxycorticoid excretion. A dose of $300-500 \mathrm{mg}$ every 4 hours for six doses is often used, and urine collections are made on the day before and the day after treatment. In patients with Cushing's syndrome, a normal response to metyrapone indicates that the cortisol excess is not the result of a cortisol-secreting adrenal carcinoma or adenoma, since secretion by such tumors produces suppression of ACTH and atrophy of normal adrenal cortex.

Pituitary function may also be tested by administering metyrapone, $2-3 \mathrm{~g}$ orally at midnight, and measuring the level of ACTH or 11-deoxycortisol in blood drawn at 8 AM, or by comparing the excretion of 17hydroxycorticosteroids in the urine during the 24 -hour periods preceding and following administration of the drug. In patients with suspected or known lesions of the pituitary, this procedure is a means of estimating the ability of the gland to produce ACTH. The drug has been withdrawn from the market in the USA but is available on a compassionate basis.

\section*{Aminoglutethimide}

Aminoglutethimide (Figure 39-5) blocks the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone and causes a reduction
in the synthesis of all hormonally active steroids (see Figure 39-1). It has been used in conjunction with dexamethasone or hydrocortisone to reduce or eliminate estrogen production in patients with carcinoma of the breast. In a dosage of $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ it was well tolerated; however, with higher dosages, lethargy and skin rash was a common effect. The use of aminoglutethimide in breast cancer patients has now been supplanted by the use of tamoxifen or another class of drugs, the aromatase inhibitors (see Chapters 40 and 55).
Aminoglutethimide can be used in conjunction with metyrapone or ketoconazole to reduce steroid secretion in patients with Cushing's syndrome due to adrenocortical cancer who do not respond to mitotane.

Aminoglutethimide also apparently increases the clearance of some steroids. It has been shown to enhance the metabolism of dexamethasone, reducing its half-life from 4-5 hours to 2 hours.

\section*{Ketoconazole}

Ketoconazole, an antifungal imidazole derivative (see Chapter 48), is a potent and rather nonselective inhibitor of adrenal and gonadal steroid synthesis. This compound inhibits the cholesterol side chain cleavage, P450c17, C17,20-lyase, 3B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and P450c11 enzymes required for steroid hormone synthesis. The sensitivity of the P450 enzymes to this compound in mammalian tissues is much lower than that needed to treat fungal infections, so that its inhibitory effects on steroid biosynthesis are seen only at high doses.

Ketoconazole has been used for the treatment of patients with Cushing's syndrome due to several causes. Dosages of 200-1200 mg/d have produced a reduction in hormone levels and impressive clinical improvement. This drug has some hepatotoxicity and should be started at $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ and slowly increased by $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ every $2-3$ days up to a total daily dose of 1000 mg .

\section*{Mifepristone (RU 486)}

The search for a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist finally succeeded in the early 1980s with the development of the 11B-aminophenyl-substituted 19-norsteroid called RU 486, later named mifepristone. This compound has strong antiprogestin activity and initially was proposed as a contraceptive-contragestive agent. High doses of mifepristone exert antiglucocorticoid activity by blocking the glucocorticoid receptor, since mifepristone binds to it with high affinity, causing (1) some stabilization of the Hsp-glucocorticoid receptor complex and inhibition of the dissociation of the RU 486-bound glucocorticoid receptor from the Hsp chaperone proteins; and (2) alteration of the interaction of the glucocorticoid receptor with coregulators, favoring the formation of a transcriptionally inactive complex in the cell nucleus. The result is inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor activation.

The mean half-life of mifepristone is 20 hours. This is longer than that of many natural and synthetic glucocorticoid agonists (dexamethasone has a half-life of $4-5$ hours). Less than $1 \%$ of the daily dose is excreted in the urine, suggesting a minor role of kidneys in the clearance of the compound. The long plasma half-life of mifepristone results from extensive and strong binding to plasma proteins. Less than $5 \%$ of the compound is found in the free form when plasma is analyzed by equilibrium dialysis. Mifepristone can bind to albumin and $Q_{1}$-acid glycoprotein, but it has no affinity for CBG.

In humans, mifepristone causes generalized glucocorticoid resistance. Given orally to several patients with Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic ACTH production or adrenal carcinoma, it was able to reverse the cushingoid phenotype, to eliminate carbohydrate intolerance, normalize blood pressure, correct thyroid and gonadal hormone suppression, and ameliorate the psychologic sequelae of hypercortisolism in these patients.

At present, this use of mifepristone can only be recommended for inoperable patients with ectopic ACTH secretion or adrenal carcinoma who have failed to respond to other therapeutic manipulations. Its pharmacology and use in women as a progesterone antagonist are discussed in Chapter 40.

\section*{Mitotane}

Mitotane (Figure 39-5) has adrenolytic properties in dogs and to a lesser extent in humans. This drug is administered orally in divided doses up to 12 g daily. About one third of patients with adrenal carcinoma show a reduction in tumor mass. In 80\% of patients, the toxic effects are sufficiently severe to require dose reduction. These include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, depression, somnolence, and skin rashes. The drug has been withdrawn from the market in the USA but is available on a compassionate basis.

\section*{Trilostane}

Trilostane is a 3B-17 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor that interferes with the synthesis of adrenal and gonadal hormones and is comparable to aminoglutethimide. Its side effects are predominantly gastrointestinal; adverse effects occur in about 50\% of patients with both agents. There is no crossresistance or crossover of side effects between these compounds.

\section*{MINERALOCORTI COI D ANTAGONI STS}

In addition to agents that interfere with aldosterone synthesis (see above), there are steroids that compete with aldosterone for its receptor and decrease its effect peripherally. Progesterone is mildly active in this respect.

Spironolactone is a 7a-acetylthiospironolactone. Its onset of action is slow, and the effects last for 2-3 days after the drug is discontinued. It is used in the treatment of primary aldosteronism in dosages of 50-100 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. This agent reverses many of the manifestations of aldosteronism. It has been useful in establishing the diagnosis in some patients and in ameliorating the signs and symptoms when surgical removal of an adenoma is delayed. When used diagnostically for the detection of aldosteronism in hypokalemic patients with hypertension, dosages of $400-500 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ for $4-8$ days-with an adequate intake of sodium and potassium-will restore potassium levels to or toward normal. This agent is also useful in preparing these patients for surgery. Dosages of $300-400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ for 2 weeks are used for this purpose and may reduce the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias.

Spironolactone is also an androgen antagonist and as such is sometimes used in treatment of hirsutism in women. Dosages of $50-200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ cause a reduction in the density, diameter, and rate of growth of facial hair in patients with idiopathic hirsutism or hirsutism secondary to androgen excess. The effect can usually be seen in 2 months and becomes maximal in about 6 months.

Spironolactone

The use of spironolactone as a diuretic is discussed in Chapter 15. The drug has benefits in heart failure greater than those predicted from its diuretic effects alone (see Chapter 13). Adverse effects reported for spironolactone include hyperkalemia, cardiac arrhythmia, menstrual abnormalities, gynecomastia, sedation, headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, and skin rashes.

Eplerenone, another aldosterone antagonist, is approved for the treatment of hypertension (see Chapters 11 and 15). This aldosterone receptor antagonist is somewhat more selective than spironolactone and has no reported effects on androgen receptors. The standard dosage in hypertension is $50-100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. The most common toxicity is hyperkalemia but this is usually mild.

Drospirenone, a progestin in an oral contraceptive, also antagonizes the effects of aldosterone.

\section*{THE OVARY (ESTROGENS, PROGESTI NS, OTHER OVARI AN HORMONES, ORAL CONTRACEPTI VES, I NHI BITORS \& ANTAGONI STS, \& OVULATI ONI NDUCI NG AGENTS)}

The ovary has important gametogenic functions that are integrated with its hormonal activity. In the human female, the gonad is relatively quiescent during childhood, the period of rapid growth and maturation. At puberty, the ovary begins a 30- to 40-year period of cyclic function called the menstrual cycle because of the regular episodes of bleeding that are its most obvious manifestation. It then fails to respond to gonadotropins secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, and the cessation of cyclic bleeding that occurs is called the menopause.

The mechanism responsible for the onset of ovarian function at the time of puberty is thought to be neural in origin, because the immature gonad can be stimulated by gonadotropins already present in the pituitary and because the pituitary is responsive to exogenous hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone. The maturation of centers in the brain may withdraw a childhood-related inhibitory effect upon hypothalamic arcuate nucleus neurons, allowing them to produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in pulses with the appropriate amplitude, which stimulates the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) (see Chapter 37). At first, small amounts of the latter two hormones are released during the night, and the limited quantities of ovarian estrogen secreted in response start to cause breast development. Subsequently, FSH and LH are secreted throughout the day and night, causing secretion of higher amounts of estrogen and leading to further breast enlargement, alterations in fat distribution, and a
growth spurt that culminates in epiphysial closure in the long bones. The beginning of ovarian function at puberty is called gonadarche.

A year or so after gonadarche, sufficient estrogen is produced to induce endometrial changes and periodic bleeding. After the first few irregular cycles, which may be anovulatory, normal cyclic function is established.

At the beginning of each cycle, a variable number of follicles (vesicular follicles), each containing an ovum, begin to enlarge in response to FSH. After 5 or 6 days, one follicle, called the dominant follicle, begins to develop more rapidly. The outer theca and inner granulosa cells of this follicle multiply and, under the influence of LH, synthesize and release estrogens at an increasing rate. The estrogens appear to inhibit FSH release and may lead to regression of the smaller, less mature follicles. The mature dominant ovarian follicle consists of an ovum surrounded by a fluid-filled antrum lined by granulosa and theca cells. The estrogen secretion reaches a peak just before midcycle, and the granulosa cells begin to secrete progesterone. These changes stimulate the brief surge in LH and FSH release that precedes and causes ovulation. When the follicle ruptures, the ovum is released into the abdominal cavity near the opening of the uterine tube.

Following the above events, the cavity of the ruptured follicle fills with blood (corpus hemorrhagicum), and the luteinized theca and granulosa cells proliferate and replace the blood to form the corpus luteum. The cells of this structure produce estrogens and progesterone for the remainder of the cycle, or longer if pregnancy occurs.

If pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum begins to degenerate and ceases hormone production, eventually becoming a corpus albicans. The endometrium, which proliferated during the follicular phase and developed its glandular function during the luteal phase, is shed in the process of menstruation. These events are summarized in Figure 40-1.

The menstrual cycle, showing plasma levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones and histologic changes.

The ovary normally ceases its gametogenic and endocrine function with time. This change is accompanied by a cessation in uterine bleeding (menopause) and occurs at a mean age of 52 years in the USA. Although the ovary ceases to secrete estrogen, significant levels of estrogen persist in many women as a result of conversion of adrenal and ovarian steroids such as androstenedione to estrone and estradiol in adipose and possibly other nonendocrine tissues.

\section*{Disturbances in Ovarian Function}

Disturbances of cyclic function are common even during the peak years of reproduction. A minority of these
result from inflammatory or neoplastic processes that influence the functions of the uterus, ovaries, or pituitary. Many of the minor disturbances leading to periods of amenorrhea or anovulatory cycles are selflimited. They are often associated with emotional or physical stress and represent temporary alterations in the stress centers in the brain that control the secretion of GnRH. Anovulatory cycles are also associated with eating disorders (bulimia, anorexia nervosa) and with severe exercise such as distance running and swimming. Among the more common organic causes of persistent ovulatory disturbances are pituitary prolactinomas and syndromes and tumors characterized by excessive ovarian or adrenal androgen production. Normal ovarian function can be modified by androgens produced by the adrenal cortex or tumors arising from it. The ovary also gives rise to androgen-producing neoplasms such as arrhenoblastomas, as well as to estrogen-producing granulosa cell tumors.

\section*{The Estrogens}

Estrogenic activity is shared by a large number of chemical substances. In addition to the variety of steroidal estrogens derived from animal sources, numerous nonsteroidal estrogens have been synthesized. Many phenols are estrogenic, and estrogenic activity has been identified in such diverse forms of life as those found in ocean sediments. Estrogen-mimetic compounds (flavonoids) are found in many plants, including saw palmetto, and soybeans and other foods. Studies have shown that a diet rich in these plant products may produce slight estrogenic effects. Additionally, some compounds used in the manufacture of plastics (bisphenols, alkylphenols, phthalate phenols) have been found to be estrogenic. It has been proposed that these agents are associated with an increased breast cancer incidence in both women and men in the industrialized world.

\section*{Natural Estrogens}

The major estrogens produced by women are estradiol (estradiol-17B, $E_{2}$ ), estrone ( $E_{1}$ ), and estriol ( $E_{3}$ ) (Figure 40-2). Estradiol is the major secretory product of the ovary. Although some estrone is produced in the ovary, most estrone and estriol are formed in the liver from estradiol or in peripheral tissues from androstenedione and other androgens (see Figure 39-1). As noted above, during the first part of the menstrual cycle estrogens are produced in the ovarian follicle by the theca and granulosa cells. After ovulation, the estrogens as well as progesterone are synthesized by the luteinized granulosa and theca cells of the corpus luteum, and the pathways of biosynthesis are slightly different.

Biosynthesis and metabolism of estrogens and testosterone.

During pregnancy, a large amount of estrogen is synthesized by the fetoplacental unit-consisting of the fetal adrenal zone, secreting androgen precursor, and the placenta, which aromatizes it into estrogen. The estriol synthesized by the fetoplacental unit is released into the maternal circulation and excreted into the urine. Repeated assay of maternal urinary estriol excretion has been used in the assessment of fetal well-being.

One of the most prolific natural sources of estrogenic substances is the stallion, which liberates more of these hormones than the pregnant mare or pregnant woman. The equine estrogens-equilenin and equilin-and their congeners are unsaturated in the B as well as the A ring and are excreted in large quantities in urine, from which they can be recovered and used for medicinal purposes.

In normal women, estradiol is produced at a rate that varies during the menstrual cycle, resulting in plasma levels as low as $50 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}$ in the early follicular phase to as high as $350-850 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}$ at the time of the preovulatory peak (Figure 40-1).

\section*{Synthetic Estrogens}

A variety of chemical alterations have been produced in the natural estrogens. The most important effect of these alterations has been to increase the oral effectiveness of the estrogens. Some structures are shown in Figure 40-3. Those with therapeutic use are listed in Table 40-1.

Pharmacokinetics

When released into the circulation, estradiol binds strongly to an $a_{2}$ globulin (sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG]) and with lower affinity to albumin. Bound estrogen is relatively unavailable for diffusion into cells, so it is the free fraction that is physiologically active. Estradiol is converted by the liver and other tissues to estrone and estriol (which have low affinity for the estrogen receptor, Figure 40-2) and their 2 -hydroxylated derivatives and conjugated metabolites (which are too insoluble in lipid to cross the cell membrane readily) and excreted in the bile. However, the conjugates may be hydrolyzed in the intestine to active, reabsorbable compounds. Estrogens are also excreted in small amounts in the breast milk of nursing mothers.

Because significant amounts of estrogens and their active metabolites are excreted in the bile and reabsorbed from the intestine, the resulting enterohepatic circulation ensures that orally administered estrogens will have a high ratio of hepatic to peripheral effects. As noted below, the hepatic effects are thought to be responsible for some undesirable actions such as synthesis of increased clotting factors and plasma renin substrate. The hepatic effects of estrogen can be minimized by routes that avoid first-pass liver exposure, ie, vaginal, transdermal, or by injection.

\section*{Physiologic Effects}

\section*{MECHANISM}

Plasma estrogens in the blood and interstitial fluid are bound to SHBG, from which they dissociate to enter the cell and bind to their receptor. Two genes code for two estrogen receptor isoforms, and $B$, which are members of the superfamily of steroid, sterol, retinoic acid, and thyroid receptors. The estrogen receptors are found predominantly in the nucleus bound to heat shock proteins that stabilize them (see Figure 39-4).

Binding of the hormone to its receptor alters its conformation and releases it from the stabilizing proteins (predominantly Hsp90). The receptor-hormone complex forms homodimers that bind to a specific sequence of nucleotides called estrogen response elements (EREs) in the promoters of various genes and regulate their transcription. The ERE is composed of two half-sites arranged as a palindrome separated by a small group of nucleotides called the spacer. The interaction of a receptor dimer with the ERE also involves a number of nuclear proteins, the coregulators, as well as components of the transcription machinery. The receptor may also bind to other transcription factors to influence the effects of these factors on their responsive genes.

The relative concentrations and types of receptors, receptor coregulators, and transcription factors confer the cell specificity of the hormone's actions. The genomic effects of estrogens are mainly due to proteins synthesized by translation of RNA transcribed from a responsive gene. Some of the effects of estrogens are indirect, mediated by the autocrine and paracrine actions of autacoids such as growth factors, lipids, glycolipids, and cytokines produced by the target cells in response to estrogen.

Rapid estrogen-induced effects such as granulosa cell $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ uptake and increased uterine blood flow do not require gene activation. These appear to be mediated by nongenomic effects of the classic estrogen receptorestrogen complex, influencing several intracellular signaling pathways.

\section*{FEMALE MATURATION}

Estrogens are required for the normal sexual maturation and growth of the female. They stimulate the development of the vagina, uterus, and uterine tubes as well as the secondary sex characteristics. They stimulate stromal development and ductal growth in the breast and are responsible for the accelerated growth phase and the closing of the epiphyses of the long bones that occur at puberty. They contribute to the growth of axillary and pubic hair and alter the distribution of body fat to produce typical female body contours. Larger quantities also stimulate development of pigmentation in the skin, most prominent in the region of the nipples
and areolae and in the genital region.

\section*{ENDOMETRIAL EFFECTS}

In addition to its growth effects on uterine muscle, estrogen also plays an important role in the development of the endometrial lining. When estrogen production is properly coordinated with the production of progesterone during the normal human menstrual cycle, regular periodic bleeding and shedding of the endometrial lining occur. Continuous exposure to estrogens for prolonged periods leads to hyperplasia of the endometrium that is usually associated with abnormal bleeding patterns.

\section*{METABOLIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS}

Estrogens have a number of important metabolic and cardiovascular effects. They seem to be partially responsible for maintenance of the normal structure and function of the skin and blood vessels in women. Estrogens also decrease the rate of resorption of bone by promoting the apoptosis of osteoclasts and by antagonizing the osteoclastogenic and pro-osteoclastic effects of parathyroid hormone and interleukin-6. Estrogens also stimulate adipose tissue production of leptin and are in part responsible for the higher levels of this hormone in women than in men.

In addition to stimulating the synthesis of enzymes and growth factors leading to uterine and breast growth and differentiation, estrogens alter the production and activity of many other proteins in the body. Metabolic alterations in the liver are especially important, so that there is a higher circulating level of proteins such as transcortin (CBG), thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), SHBG, transferrin, renin substrate, and fibrinogen. This leads to increased circulating levels of thyroxine, estrogen, testosterone, iron, copper, and other substances.

Alterations in the composition of the plasma lipids caused by estrogens are characterized by an increase in the high-density lipoproteins (HDL), a slight reduction in the low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and a reduction in total plasma cholesterol levels. Plasma triglyceride levels are increased. Estrogens decrease hepatic oxidation of adipose tissue lipid to ketones and increase synthesis of triglycerides.

\section*{EFFECTS ON BLOOD COAGULATION}

Estrogens enhance the coagulability of blood. Many changes in factors influencing coagulation have been reported, including increased circulating levels of factors II, VII, IX, and X and decreased antithrombin III, partially as a result of the hepatic effects mentioned above. Increased plasminogen levels and decreased platelet adhesiveness have also been found (see Hormonal Contraception, below).

\section*{OTHER EFFECTS}

Estrogens induce the synthesis of progesterone receptors. They are responsible for estrous behavior in animals and may influence behavior and libido in humans. Administration of estrogens stimulates central components of the stress system, including the production of corticotropin-releasing hormone and the activity of the sympathetic system, and promotes a sense of well-being when given to women who are estrogen-deficient. They also facilitate the loss of intravascular fluid into the extracellular space, producing edema. The resulting decrease in plasma volume causes a compensatory retention of sodium and water by the kidney. Estrogens also modulate sympathetic nervous system control of smooth muscle function.

\section*{Clinical Uses*}

\section*{PRIMARY HYPOGONADISM}

Estrogens have been used extensively for replacement therapy in estrogen-deficient patients. The estrogen deficiency may be due to primary failure of development of the ovaries, premature menopause, castration, or menopause.

Treatment of primary hypogonadism is usually begun at 11-13 years of age in order to stimulate the development of secondary sex characteristics and menses, to stimulate optimal growth, to prevent osteoporosis and to avoid the psychologic consequences of delayed puberty and estrogen deficiency. Treatment attempts to mimic the physiology of puberty. It is initiated with small doses of estrogen ( 0.3 mg conjugated estrogens or $5-10 \mathrm{mcg}$ ethinyl estradiol) on days $1-21$ each month and is slowly increased to adult doses and then maintained until the age of menopause (approximately 51 years of age). A progestin is added after the first uterine bleeding. When growth is completed, chronic therapy consists mainly of the administration of adult doses of both estrogens and progestins, as described below.

\section*{POSTMENOPAUSAL HORMONAL THERAPY}

In addition to the signs and symptoms that follow closely upon the cessation of normal ovarian function-such as loss of periods, vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbances, and genital atrophy-there are longer-lasting changes that influence the health and well-being of postmenopausal women. These include an acceleration of bone loss, which in susceptible women may lead to vertebral, hip, and wrist fractures; and lipid changes, which may contribute to the acceleration of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease noted in postmenopausal women. The effects of estrogens on bone have been extensively studied, and the effects of hormone withdrawal have been well-characterized. However, the role of estrogens and progestins in the cause and prevention of cardiovascular disease, which is responsible for 350,000 deaths per year, and breast cancer, which causes 35,000 deaths per year, is less well understood.

When normal ovulatory function ceases and the estrogen levels fall after menopause, oophorectomy, or premature ovarian failure, there is an accelerated rise in plasma cholesterol and LDL concentrations, while LDL receptors decline. HDL is not much affected, and levels remain higher than in men. Very-low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels are also relatively unaffected. Since cardiovascular disorders account for most deaths in this age group, the risk for these disorders constitutes a major consideration in deciding whether or not hormonal "replacement" therapy (HRT, also called HT) is indicated and influences the selection of hormones to be administered. Estrogen replacement therapy has a beneficial effect on circulating lipids and lipoproteins, and this was earlier thought to be accompanied by a reduction in myocardial infarction by about $50 \%$ and of fatal strokes by as much as $40 \%$. These findings, however, have been recently disputed by the results of a large study from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) project showing no cardiovascular benefit from estrogen plus progestin replacement therapy in perimenopausal or older postmenopausal patients. In fact, there may be a small increase in cardiovascular problems as well as breast cancer in women who received the replacement therapy. Interestingly, a small protective effect against colon cancer was observed. Although current clinical guidelines do not recommend routine hormone therapy in postmenopausal women, the validity of the WHI report has been questioned. Young women with premature menopause should definitely recieve HRT. In other recent studies, a protective effect of estrogen replacement therapy against Alzheimer's disease was observed.

Progestins antagonize estrogen's effects on LDL and HDL to a variable extent. However, one large study has shown that the addition of a progestin to estrogen replacement therapy does not influence the cardiovascular risk.

Optimal management of the postmenopausal patient requires careful assessment of her symptoms as well as consideration of her age and the presence of (or risks for) cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer. Bearing in mind the effects of the gonadal hormones on each of these disorders, the goals of therapy can then be defined and the risks of therapy assessed and discussed with the patient.

If the main indication for therapy is hot flushes and sleep disturbances, therapy with the lowest dose of estrogen required for symptomatic relief is recommended. Treatment may be required for only a limited period of time and the possible increased risk for breast cancer avoided. In women who have undergone hysterectomy, estrogens alone can be given 5 days per week or continuously, since progestins are not required to reduce the risk for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Hot flushes, sweating, insomnia, and atrophic vaginitis are generally relieved by estrogens; many patients experience some increased sense of wellbeing; and climacteric depression and other psychopathologic states are improved.

The role of estrogens in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis has been carefully studied (see Chapter 42). The amount of bone present in the body is maximal in the young active adult in the third decade of life and begins to decline more rapidly in middle age in both men and women. The development of osteoporosis also depends on the amount of bone present at the start of this process, on vitamin D and calcium intake, and on the degree of physical activity. The risk of osteoporosis is highest in smokers who are thin, Caucasian, and inactive and have a low calcium intake and a strong family history of osteoporosis. Depression also is a major risk factor for development of osteoporosis in women.

Estrogens should be used in the smallest dosage consistent with relief of symptoms. In women who have not undergone hysterectomy, it is most convenient to prescribe estrogen on the first 21-25 days of each month. The recommended dosages of estrogen are $0.3-1.25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ of conjugated estrogen or $0.01-0.02 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ of ethinyl estradiol. Dosages in the middle of these ranges have been shown to be maximally effective in preventing the decrease in bone density occurring at menopause. From this point of view, it is important to begin therapy as soon as possible after the menopause for maximum effect. In these patients and others not taking estrogen, calcium supplements that bring the total daily calcium intake up to 1500 mg are useful.

Patients at low risk of developing osteoporosis who manifest only mild atrophic vaginitis can be treated with topical preparations. The vaginal route of application is also useful in the treatment of urinary tract symptoms in these patients. It is important to realize, however, that although locally administered estrogens escape the first-pass effect (so that some undesirable hepatic effects are reduced), they are almost completely absorbed into the circulation, and these preparations should be given cyclically.

As noted below, the administration of estrogen is associated with an increased risk of endometrial carcinoma. The administration of a progestational agent with the estrogen prevents endometrial hyperplasia and markedly reduces the risk of this cancer. When estrogen is given for the first 25 days of the month and the progestin medroxyprogesterone ( $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) is added during the last 10-14 days, the risk is only half of that in women not receiving hormone replacement therapy. On this regimen, some women will experience a return of symptoms during the period off estrogen administration. In these patients, the estrogen can be given continuously. If the progestin produces sedation or other undesirable effects, its dose can be reduced to $2.5-5 \mathrm{mg}$ for the last 10 days of the cycle with a slight increase in the risk for endometrial hyperplasia. These regimens are usually accompanied by bleeding at the end of each cycle. Some women experience migraine headaches during the last few days of the cycle. The use of a continuous estrogen regimen will often prevent their occurrence. Women who object to the cyclic bleeding associated with sequential therapy can also consider continuous therapy. Daily therapy with 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens and $2.5-5 \mathrm{mg}$ of medroxyprogesterone will eliminate cyclic bleeding, control vasomotor symptoms, prevent genital atrophy, maintain bone density, and show a favorable lipid profile with a small decrease in LDL and an increase in HDL concentrations. These women have endometrial atrophy on biopsy. About half of these patients experience breakthrough bleeding during the first few months of therapy. Seventy to 80 percent become amenorrheic after the first 4 months,
and most remain so. The main disadvantage of continuous therapy is the need for uterine biopsy if bleeding occurs after the first few months.

As noted above, estrogens may also be administered vaginally or transdermally. When estrogens are given by these routes, the liver is bypassed on the first circulation, and the ratio of the liver effects to peripheral effects is reduced.

In patients in whom estrogen replacement therapy is contraindicated, such as those with estrogen-sensitive tumors, relief of vasomotor symptoms may be obtained by the use of clonidine.

\section*{OTHER USES}

Estrogens combined with progestins can be used to suppress ovulation in patients with intractable dysmenorrhea or when suppression of ovarian function is used in the treatment of hirsutism and amenorrhea due to excessive secretion of androgens by the ovary. Under these circumstances, greater suppression may be needed, and oral contraceptives containing 50 mcg of estrogen or a combination of a low estrogen pill with GnRH suppression may be required.
* The use of estrogens in contraception is discussed below.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Adverse effects of variable severity have been reported with the therapeutic use of estrogens. Many other effects reported in conjunction with hormonal contraceptives may be related to their estrogen content. These are discussed below.

\section*{UTERI NE BLEEDI NG}

Estrogen therapy is a major cause of postmenopausal uterine bleeding. Unfortunately, vaginal bleeding at this time of life may also be due to carcinoma of the endometrium. In order to avoid confusion, patients should be treated with the smallest amount of estrogen possible. It should be given cyclically so that bleeding, if it occurs, will be more likely to occur during the withdrawal period. As noted above, endometrial hyperplasia can be prevented by administration of a progestational agent with estrogen in each cycle.

\section*{CANCER}

The relation of estrogen therapy to cancer continues to be the subject of active investigation. Although no adverse effect of short-term estrogen therapy on the incidence of breast cancer has been demonstrated, a small increase in the incidence of this tumor may occur with prolonged therapy. Although the risk factor is small (1.25), the impact may be great since this tumor occurs in $10 \%$ of women, and addition of progesterone does not confer a protective effect. Studies indicate that following unilateral excision of breast cancer, women receiving tamoxifen (an estrogen partial agonist, see below) show a $35 \%$ decrease in contralateral breast cancer compared with controls. These studies also demonstrate that tamoxifen is well tolerated by most patients, produces estrogen-like alterations in plasma lipid levels, and stabilizes bone mineral loss. Studies bearing on the possible efficacy of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer are under way. A recent study shows that postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy with estrogens plus progestins was associated with greater breast epithelial cell proliferation and breast epithelial cell density than estrogens alone or no replacement therapy. Furthermore, with estrogens plus progestins, breast proliferation was localized to the terminal duct-lobular unit of the breast, which is the main site of development of breast cancer. Thus, further studies are needed to conclusively assess the possible association between progestins and breast cancer risk.

Many studies show an increased risk of endometrial carcinoma in patients taking estrogens alone. The risk seems to vary with the dose and duration of treatment: 15 times greater in patients taking large doses of estrogen for 5 or more years, in contrast with two to four times greater in patients receiving lower doses for short periods. However, as noted above, the concomitant use of a progestin prevents this increased risk and may in fact reduce the incidence of endometrial cancer to less than that in the general population.

There have been a number of reports of adenocarcinoma of the vagina in young women whose mothers were treated with large doses of diethylstilbestrol early in pregnancy. These cancers are most common in young women (ages 14-44). The incidence is less than 1 per 1000 women exposed-too low to establish a cause-and-effect relationship with certainty. However, the risks for infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and premature delivery are also increased. It is now recognized that there is no indication for the use of diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy, and it should be avoided. It is not known whether other estrogens have a similar effect or whether the observed phenomena are peculiar to diethylstilbestrol. This agent should be used only in the treatment of cancer (eg, of the prostate) or as a "morning after" contraceptive (see below).

\section*{OTHER EFFECTS}

Nausea and breast tenderness are common and can be minimized by using the smallest effective dose of estrogen. Hyperpigmentation also occurs. Estrogen therapy is associated with an increase in frequency of migraine headaches as well as cholestasis, gallbladder disease, and hypertension.

\section*{Contraindications}

Estrogens should not be used in patients with estrogen-dependent neoplasms such as carcinoma of the endometrium or in those with-or at high risk for-carcinoma of the breast. They should be avoided in patients with undiagnosed genital bleeding, liver disease, or a history of thromboembolic disorder. In addition, the use of estrogens should be avoided by heavy smokers.

\section*{Preparations \& Dosages}

The dosages of commonly used natural and synthetic preparations are listed in Table 40-1. Although all of the estrogens produce almost the same hormonal effects, their potencies vary both between agents and depending on the route of administration. As noted above, estradiol is the most active endogenous estrogen, and it has the highest affinity for the estrogen receptor. However, its metabolites estrone and estriol have weak uterine effects.

For a given level of gonadotropin suppression, oral estrogen preparations have more effect on the circulating levels of CBG, SHBG, and a host of other liver proteins, including angiotensinogen, than do transdermal preparations. The oral route of administration allows greater concentrations of hormone to reach the liver, thus increasing the synthesis of these proteins. Transdermal preparations were developed to avoid this effect. When administered transdermally, $50-100 \mathrm{mcg}$ of estradiol has effects similar to those of $0.625-1.25 \mathrm{mg}$ of conjugated oral estrogens on gonadotropin concentrations, endometrium, and vaginal epithelium. Furthermore, the transdermal estrogen preparations do not significantly increase the concentrations of renin substrate, CBG, and TBG and do not produce the characteristic changes in serum lipids. Combined oral preparations containing 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogens and 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate are available for menopausal replacement therapy. Tablets containing 0.625 of conjugated estrogens and 5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate are available to be used in conjunction with conjugated estrogens in a sequential fashion. Estrogens alone are taken on days 1-14 and the combination on days 15-28.

\section*{The Progestins}

\section*{Natural Progestins: Progesterone}

Progesterone is the most important progestin in humans. In addition to having important hormonal effects, it serves as a precursor to the estrogens, androgens, and adrenocortical steroids. It is synthesized in the ovary, testis, and adrenal from circulating cholesterol. Large amounts are also synthesized and released by the placenta during pregnancy.

In the ovary, progesterone is produced primarily by the corpus luteum. Normal males appear to secrete 1-5 mg of progesterone daily, resulting in plasma levels of about $0.03 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$. The level is only slightly higher in the female during the follicular phase of the cycle, when only a few milligrams per day of progesterone are secreted. During the luteal phase, plasma levels range from $0.5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$ to more than $2 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (Figure 40-1). Plasma levels of progesterone are further elevated and reach their peak levels in the third trimester of pregnancy.

\section*{Synthetic Progestins}

A variety of progestational compounds have been synthesized. Some are active when given by mouth. They are not a uniform group of compounds, and all of them differ from progesterone in one or more respects. Table 40-2 lists some of these compounds and their effects. In general, the 21-carbon compounds (hydroxyprogesterone, medroxyprogesterone, megestrol, and dimethisterone) are the most closely related, pharmacologically as well as chemically, to progesterone. A new group of third-generation synthetic progestins has been introduced, principally as components of oral contraceptives. These "19-nor, 13-ethyl" steroid compounds include desogestrel (Figure 40-4), gestodene, and norgestimate. They are claimed to have lower androgenic activity than older synthetic progestins.

Progesterone and some progestational agents in clinical use.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Progesterone is rapidly absorbed following administration by any route. Its half-life in the plasma is approximately 5 minutes, and small amounts are stored temporarily in body fat. It is almost completely metabolized in one passage through the liver, and for that reason it is quite ineffective when the usual formulation is administered orally. However, high-dose oral micronized progesterone preparations have been developed that provide adequate progestational effect.

In the liver, progesterone is metabolized to pregnanediol and conjugated with glucuronic acid. It is excreted into the urine as pregnanediol glucuronide. The amount of pregnanediol in the urine has been used as an index of progesterone secretion. This measure has been very useful in spite of the fact that the proportion of
secreted progesterone converted to this compound varies from day to day and from individual to individual. In addition to progesterone, 20- and 20B-hydroxyprogesterone (20\%- and 20B-hydroxy-4-pregnene-3-one) are also found. These compounds have about one fifth the progestational activity of progesterone in humans and other species. Little is known of their physiologic role, but 20x-hydroxyprogesterone is produced in large amounts in some species and may be of some importance biologically.

The usual routes of administration and durations of action of the synthetic progestins are listed in Table 40-2. Most of these agents are extensively metabolized to inactive products that are excreted mainly in the urine.

\section*{Physiologic Effects}

\section*{MECHANISM}

The mechanism of action of progesterone-described in more detail above-is similar to that of other steroid hormones. Progestins enter the cell and bind to progesterone receptors that are distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The ligand-receptor complex binds to a progesterone response element (PRE) to activate gene transcription. The response element for progesterone appears to be similar to the corticosteroid response element, and the specificity of the response depends upon which receptor is present in the cell as well as upon other cell-specific receptor coregulators and interacting transcription factors. The progesteronereceptor complex forms a dimer before binding to DNA. Like the estrogen receptor, it can form heterodimers as well as homodimers between two isoforms: A and B. These isoforms are produced by alternative splicing of the same gene.

\section*{EFFECTS OF PROGESTERONE}

Progesterone has little effect on protein metabolism. It stimulates lipoprotein lipase activity and seems to favor fat deposition. The effects on carbohydrate metabolism are more marked. Progesterone increases basal insulin levels and the insulin response to glucose. There is usually no manifest change in carbohydrate tolerance. In the liver, progesterone promotes glycogen storage, possibly by facilitating the effect of insulin. Progesterone also promotes ketogenesis.

Progesterone can compete with aldosterone for the mineralocorticoid receptor of the renal tubule, causing a decrease in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption. This leads to an increased secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex (eg, in pregnancy). Progesterone increases body temperature in humans. The mechanism of this effect is not known, but an alteration of the temperature-regulating centers in the hypothalamus has been suggested. Progesterone also alters the function of the respiratory centers. The ventilatory response to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is increased (synthetic progestins with an ethinyl group do not have respiratory effects). This leads to a measurable reduction in arterial and alveolar P CO 2 during pregnancy and in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Progesterone and related steroids also have depressant and hypnotic effects on the brain.

Progesterone is responsible for the alveolobular development of the secretory apparatus in the breast. It also participates in the preovulatory LH surge and causes the maturation and secretory changes in the endometrium that are seen following ovulation (Figure 40-1).

Progesterone decreases the plasma levels of many amino acids and leads to increased urinary nitrogen excretion. It induces changes in the structure and function of smooth endoplasmic reticulum in experimental animals.

Other effects of progesterone and its analogs are noted below in the section on Hormonal Contraception.

\section*{SYNTHETIC PROGESTINS}

The 21-carbon progesterone analogs antagonize aldosterone-induced sodium retention (see above). The remaining compounds ("19-nortestosterone" third-generation agents) produce a decidual change in the endometrial stroma, do not support pregnancy in test animals, are more effective gonadotropin inhibitors, and may have minimal estrogenic and androgenic or anabolic activity (Table 40-2, Figure 40-4). They are sometimes referred to as "impeded androgens." Progestins without androgenic activity include desogestrel, norgestimate, and gestodene. The first two of these compounds are dispensed in combination with ethinyl estradiol for oral contraception (Table 40-3) in the USA. Oral contraceptives containing the progestins cyproterone acetate (also an antiandrogen) in combination with ethinyl estradiol are investigational in the USA.

\section*{Clinical Uses of Progestins}

\section*{THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS}

The major uses of progestational hormones are for hormone replacement therapy (see above) and hormonal contraception (see below). In addition, they are useful in producing long-term ovarian suppression for other purposes. When used alone in large doses parenterally (eg, medroxyprogesterone acetate, 150 mg intramuscularly every 90 days), prolonged anovulation and amenorrhea result. This therapy has been employed in the treatment of dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, and bleeding disorders when estrogens are contraindicated, and for contraception. The major problem with this regimen is the prolonged time required in some patients for ovulatory function to return after cessation of therapy. It should not be used for patients planning a pregnancy in the near future. Similar regimens will relieve hot flushes in some menopausal women
and can be used if estrogen therapy is contraindicated.
Medroxyprogesterone acetate, $10-20 \mathrm{mg}$ orally twice weekly-or intramuscularly in doses of $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ every 1-2 weeks-will prevent menstruation, but it will not arrest accelerated bone maturation in children with precocious puberty.

Progestins do not appear to have any place in the therapy of threatened or habitual abortion. Early reports of the usefulness of these agents resulted from the unwarranted assumption that after several abortions the likelihood of repeated abortions was over $90 \%$. When progestational agents were administered to patients with previous abortions, a salvage rate of $80 \%$ was achieved. It is now recognized that similar patients abort only $20 \%$ of the time even when untreated. On the other hand, progesterone was experimentally given recently to delay premature labor with encouraging results.

Progesterone and medroxyprogesterone have been used in the treatment of women who have difficulty in conceiving and who demonstrate a slow rise in basal body temperature. There is no convincing evidence that this treatment is effective.

Preparations of progesterone and medroxyprogesterone have been used to treat premenstrual syndrome. Controlled studies have not confirmed the effectiveness of such therapy except when doses sufficient to suppress ovulation have been used.

\section*{DIAGNOSTIC USES}

Progesterone can be used as a test of estrogen secretion. The administration of progesterone, $150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, or medroxyprogesterone, $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, for $5-7$ days, is followed by withdrawal bleeding in amenorrheic patients only when the endometrium has been stimulated by estrogens. A combination of estrogen and progestin can be given to test the responsiveness of the endometrium in patients with amenorrhea.

\section*{Contraindications, Cautions, \& Adverse Effects}

Studies of progestational compounds alone and with combination oral contraceptives indicate that the progestin in these agents may increase blood pressure in some patients. The more androgenic progestins also reduce plasma HDL levels in women. (See Hormonal Contraception, below.) Two recent studies suggest that combined progestin plus estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women may increase breast cancer risk significantly compared with the risk in women taking estrogen alone. These findings require careful examination and if confirmed will lead to important changes in postmenopausal hormone replacement practice.

\section*{Other Ovarian Hormones}

The normal ovary produces small amounts of androgens, including testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone. Of these, only testosterone has a significant amount of biologic activity, although androstenedione can be converted to testosterone or estrone in peripheral tissues. The normal woman produces less than 200 mcg of testosterone in 24 hours, and about one third of this is probably formed in the ovary directly. The physiologic significance of these small amounts of androgens is not established, but they may be partly responsible for normal hair growth at puberty, for stimulation of female libido, and, possibly, for metabolic effects. Androgen production by the ovary may be markedly increased in some abnormal states, usually in association with hirsutism and amenorrhea as noted above.

The ovary also produces inhibin and activin. These peptides consist of several combinations of and $B$ subunits and are described in greater detail later. The abdimer (inhibin) inhibits FSH secretion while the BB dimer (activin) increases FSH secretion. Studies in primates indicate that inhibin has no direct effect on ovarian
steroidogenesis but that activin modulates the response to LH and FSH. For example, simultaneous treatment with activin and human FSH enhances FSH stimulation of progesterone synthesis and aromatase activity in granulosa cells. When combined with LH, activin suppressed the LH-induced progesterone response by 50\% but markedly enhanced basal and LH-stimulated aromatase activity. Activin may also act as a growth factor in other tissues. The physiologic roles of these modulators are not fully understood.

Relaxin is another peptide that can be extracted from the ovary. The three-dimensional structure of relaxin is related to that of growth-promoting peptides and is similar to that of insulin. Although the amino acid sequence differs from that of insulin, this hormone, like insulin, consists of two chains linked by disulfide bonds, cleaved from a prohormone. It is found in the ovary, placenta, uterus, and blood. Relaxin synthesis has been demonstrated in luteinized granulosa cells of the corpus luteum. It has been shown to increase glycogen synthesis and water uptake by the myometrium and decreases uterine contractility. In some species, it changes the mechanical properties of the cervix and pubic ligaments, facilitating delivery.

In women, relaxin has been measured by immunoassay. Levels were highest immediately after the LH surge and during menstruation. A physiologic role for this peptide has not been established.

Clinical trials with relaxin have been conducted in patients with dysmenorrhea. Relaxin has also been administered to patients in premature labor and during prolonged labor. When applied to the cervix of a woman at term, it facilitates dilation and shortens labor.

Several other nonsteroidal substances such as corticotropin-releasing hormone, follistatin, and prostaglandins are produced by the ovary. These probably have paracrine effects within the ovary.

\section*{Hormonal Contraception (Oral, Parenteral, \& I mplanted Contraceptives)}

A large number of oral contraceptives containing estrogens or progestins (or both) are now available for clinical use (Table 40-3). These preparations vary chemically and pharmacologically and have many properties in common as well as definite differences important for the correct selection of the optimum agent.

Two types of preparations are used for oral contraception: (1) combinations of estrogens and progestins and (2) continuous progestin therapy without concomitant administration of estrogens. The combination agents are further divided into monophasic forms (constant dosage of both components during the cycle) and biphasic or triphasic forms (dosage of one or both components is changed once or twice during the cycle). The preparations for oral use are all adequately absorbed, and in combination preparations the pharmacokinetics of neither drug is significantly altered by the other.

Few implantable contraceptive preparations are available at present in the USA. Norgestrel, also used in some oral contraceptives, is available in the subcutaneous implant form listed in Table 40-3, and has been available for several years. An implant containing etonogestrel, a newer progestin, is available overseas and will be marketed in the USA as Implanon. Several hormonal contraceptives are available as vaginal rings or intrauterine devices. Intramuscular injection of large doses of medroxyprogesterone also provides contraception of long duration.

\section*{Pharmacologic Effects}

\section*{MECHANI SM OF ACTION}

The combinations of estrogens and progestins exert their contraceptive effect largely through selective
inhibition of pituitary function that results in inhibition of ovulation. The combination agents also produce a change in the cervical mucus, in the uterine endometrium, and in motility and secretion in the uterine tubes, all of which decrease the likelihood of conception and implantation. The continuous use of progestins alone does not always inhibit ovulation. The other factors mentioned, therefore, play a major role in the prevention of pregnancy when these agents are used.

\section*{EFFECTS ON THE OVARY}

Chronic use of combination agents depresses ovarian function. Follicular development is minimal, and corpora lutea, larger follicles, stromal edema, and other morphologic features normally seen in ovulating women are absent. The ovaries usually become smaller even when enlarged before therapy.

The great majority of patients return to normal menstrual patterns when these drugs are discontinued. About $75 \%$ will ovulate in the first posttreatment cycle and $97 \%$ by the third posttreatment cycle. About $2 \%$ of patients remain amenorrheic for periods of up to several years after administration is stopped.

The cytologic findings on vaginal smears vary depending on the preparation used. However, with almost all of the combined drugs, a low maturation index is found because of the presence of progestational agents.

\section*{EFFECTS ON THE UTERUS}

After prolonged use, the cervix may show some hypertrophy and polyp formation. There are also important effects on the cervical mucus, making it more like postovulation mucus, ie, thicker and less copious.

Agents containing both estrogens and progestins produce further morphologic and biochemical changes of the endometrial stroma under the influence of the progestin, which also stimulates glandular secretion throughout the luteal phase. The agents containing "19-nor" progestins-particularly those with the smaller amounts of estrogen-tend to produce more glandular atrophy and usually less bleeding.

\section*{EFFECTS ON THE BREAST}

Stimulation of the breasts occurs in most patients receiving estrogen-containing agents. Some enlargement is generally noted. The administration of estrogens and combinations of estrogens and progestins tends to suppress lactation. When the doses are small, the effects on breast feeding are not appreciable. Studies of the transport of the oral contraceptives into breast milk suggest that only small amounts of these compounds cross into the milk, and they have not been considered to be of importance.

\section*{OTHER EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES}

\section*{Effects on the Central Nervous System}

The central nervous system effects of the oral contraceptives have not been well studied in humans. A variety of effects of estrogen and progesterone have been noted in animals. Estrogens tend to increase excitability in the brain, whereas progesterone tends to decrease it. The thermogenic action of progesterone and some of the synthetic progestins is also thought to occur in the central nervous system.

It is very difficult to evaluate any behavioral or emotional effects of these compounds in humans. Although the incidence of pronounced changes in mood, affect, and behavior appears to be low, milder changes are commonly reported, and estrogens are being successfully employed in the therapy of premenstrual tension syndrome, postpartum depression, and climacteric depression.

\section*{Effects on Endocrine Function}

The inhibition of pituitary gonadotropin secretion has been mentioned. Estrogens also alter adrenal structure and function. Estrogens given orally or at high doses increase the plasma concentration of the $\alpha_{2}$ globulin that
binds cortisol (corticosteroid-binding globulin). Plasma concentrations may be more than double the levels found in untreated individuals, and urinary excretion of free cortisol is elevated.

These preparations cause alterations in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Plasma renin activity has been found to increase, and there is an increase in aldosterone secretion.

Thyroxine-binding globulin is increased. As a result, total plasma thyroxine ( $T_{4}$ ) levels are increased to those commonly seen during pregnancy. Since more of the thyroxine is bound, the free thyroxine level in these patients is normal. Estrogens also increase the plasma level of SHBG and decrease plasma levels of free androgens by increasing their binding; large amounts of estrogen may decrease androgens by gonadotropin suppression.

\section*{Effects on Blood}

Serious thromboembolic phenomena occurring in women taking oral contraceptives gave rise to a great many studies of the effects of these compounds on blood coagulation. A clear picture of such effects has not yet emerged. The oral contraceptives do not consistently alter bleeding or clotting times. The changes that have been observed are similar to those reported in pregnancy. There is an increase in factors VII, VIII, IX, and X and a decrease in antithrombin III. Increased amounts of coumarin anticoagulants may be required to prolong prothrombin time in patients taking oral contraceptives.

There is an increase in serum iron and total iron-binding capacity similar to that reported in patients with hepatitis.

Significant alterations in the cellular components of blood have not been reported with any consistency. A number of patients have been reported to develop folic acid deficiency anemias.

\section*{Effects on the Liver}

These hormones also have profound effects on the function of the liver. Some of these effects are deleterious and will be considered below in the section on adverse effects.

The effects on serum proteins result from the effects of the estrogens on the synthesis of the various $x_{2}$ globulins and fibrinogen. Serum haptoglobins produced in the liver are depressed rather than increased by estrogen.

Some of the effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are probably influenced by changes in liver metabolism (see below).

Important alterations in hepatic drug excretion and metabolism also occur. Estrogens in the amounts seen during pregnancy or used in oral contraceptive agents delay the clearance of sulfobromophthalein and reduce the flow of bile. The proportion of cholic acid in bile acids is increased while the proportion of chenodeoxycholic acid is decreased. These changes may be responsible for the observed increase in cholelithiasis associated with the use of these agents.

\section*{Effects on Lipid Metabolism}

As noted above, estrogens increase serum triglycerides and free and esterified cholesterol. Phospholipids are also increased, as are HDL; levels of LDL usually decrease. Although the effects are marked with doses of 100 mcg of mestranol or ethinyl estradiol, doses of 50 mcg or less have minimal effects. The progestins (particularly the "19-nortestosterone" derivatives) tend to antagonize these effects of estrogen. Preparations containing small amounts of estrogen and a progestin may slightly decrease triglycerides and HDL.

\section*{Effects on Carbohydrate Metabolism}

The administration of oral contraceptives produces alterations in carbohydrate metabolism similar to those observed in pregnancy. There is a reduction in the rate of absorption of carbohydrates from the gastrointestinal tract. Progesterone increases the basal insulin level and the rise in insulin induced by carbohydrate ingestion. Preparations with more potent progestins such as norgestrel may cause progressive decreases in carbohydrate tolerance over several years. However, the changes in glucose tolerance are reversible on discontinuing medication.

\section*{Effects on the Cardiovascular System}

These agents cause small increases in cardiac output associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. The pressure returns to normal when treatment is terminated. Although the magnitude of the pressure change is small in most patients, it is marked in a few. It is important that blood pressure be followed in each patient. An increase in blood pressure has been reported to occur in few postmenopausal women treated with estrogens alone.

\section*{Effects on the Skin}

The oral contraceptives have been noted to increase pigmentation of the skin (chloasma). This effect seems to be enhanced in women with dark complexions and by exposure to ultraviolet light. Some of the androgen-like progestins might increase the production of sebum, causing acne in some patients. However, since ovarian androgen is suppressed, many patients note decreased sebum production, acne, and terminal hair growth. The sequential oral contraceptive preparations as well as estrogens alone often decrease sebum production.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

The most important use of combined estrogens and progestins is for oral contraception. A large number of preparations are available for this specific purpose, some of which are listed in Table 40-3. They are specially packaged for ease of administration. In general, they are very effective; when these agents are taken according to directions, the risk of conception is extremely small. The pregnancy rate with combination agents is estimated to be about 0.5-1 per 100 woman years at risk. Contraceptive failure has been observed in some patients when one or more doses are missed, if phenytoin is also being used (which may increase catabolism of the compounds), or if antibiotics are taken that alter enterohepatic cycling of metabolites.

Progestins and estrogens are also useful in the treatment of endometriosis. When severe dysmenorrhea is the major symptom, the suppression of ovulation with estrogen alone may be followed by painless periods. However, in most patients this approach to therapy is inadequate. The long-term administration of large doses of progestins or combinations of progestins and estrogens prevents the periodic breakdown of the endometrial tissue and in some cases will lead to endometrial fibrosis and prevent the reactivation of implants for prolonged periods.

As is true with most hormonal preparations, many of the undesired effects are physiologic or pharmacologic actions that are objectionable only because they are not pertinent to the situation for which they are being used. Therefore, the product containing the smallest effective amounts of hormones should be selected for use.
