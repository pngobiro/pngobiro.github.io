\section*{Adverse Effects}

The incidence of serious known toxicities associated with the use of these drugs is low-far lower than the risks associated with pregnancy. There are a number of reversible changes in intermediary metabolism. Minor adverse effects are frequent, but most are mild and many are transient. Continuing problems may respond to
simple changes in pill formulation. Although it is not often necessary to discontinue medication for these reasons, as many as one third of all patients started on oral contraception discontinue use for reasons other than a desire to become pregnant.

\section*{MILD ADVERSE EFFECTS}
1. Nausea, mastalgia, breakthrough bleeding, and edema are related to the amount of estrogen in the preparation. These effects can often be alleviated by a shift to a preparation containing smaller amounts of estrogen or to agents containing progestins with more androgenic effects.
2. Changes in serum proteins and other effects on endocrine function (see above) must be taken into account when thyroid, adrenal, or pituitary function is being evaluated. Increases in sedimentation rate are thought to be due to increased levels of fibrinogen.
3. Headache is mild and often transient. However, migraine is often made worse and has been reported to be associated with an increased frequency of cerebrovascular accidents. When this occurs or when migraine has its onset during therapy with these agents, treatment should be discontinued.
4. Withdrawal bleeding sometimes fails to occur-most often with combination preparations-and may cause confusion with regard to pregnancy. If this is disturbing to the patient, a different preparation may be tried or other methods of contraception used.

\section*{MODERATE ADVERSE EFFECTS}

Any of the following may require discontinuance of oral contraceptives:
1. Breakthrough bleeding is the most common problem in using progestational agents alone for contraception. It occurs in as many as $25 \%$ of patients. It is more frequently encountered in patients taking low-dose preparations than in those taking combination pills with higher levels of progestin and estrogen. The biphasic and triphasic oral contraceptives (Table 40-3) decrease breakthrough bleeding without increasing the total hormone content.
2. Weight gain is more common with the combination agents containing androgen-like progestins. It can usually be controlled by shifting to preparations with less progestin effect or by dieting.
3. Increased skin pigmentation may occur, especially in dark-skinned women. It tends to increase with time, the incidence being about $5 \%$ at the end of the first year and about $40 \%$ after 8 years. It is thought to be exacerbated by vitamin B deficiency. It is often reversible upon discontinuance of medication but may disappear very slowly.
4. Acne may be exacerbated by agents containing androgen-like progestins (Table 40-2), whereas agents containing large amounts of estrogen usually cause marked improvement in acne.
5. Hirsutism may also be aggravated by the "19-nortestosterone" derivatives, and combinations containing nonandrogenic progestins are preferred in these patients.
6. Ureteral dilation similar to that observed in pregnancy has been reported, and bacteriuria is more frequent.
7. Vaginal infections are more common and more difficult to treat in patients who are receiving oral contraceptives.
8. Amenorrhea occurs in some patients. Following cessation of administration of oral contraceptives, $95 \%$ of patients with normal menstrual histories resume normal periods and all but a few resume normal cycles during the next few months. However, some patients remain amenorrheic for several years. Many of these patients also have galactorrhea. Patients who have had menstrual irregularities before taking oral contraceptives are particularly susceptible to prolonged amenorrhea when the agents are discontinued. Prolactin levels should be measured in these patients, since many have prolactinomas.

\section*{SEVERE ADVERSE EFFECTS}

\section*{Vascular Disorders}

Thromboembolism was one of the earliest of the serious unanticipated effects to be reported and has been the most thoroughly studied.

\section*{VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLI C DI SEASE}

Superficial or deep thromboembolic disease in women not taking oral contraceptives occurs in about one patient per 1000 woman years. The overall incidence of these disorders in patients taking low-dose oral contraceptives is about threefold higher. The risk for this disorder is increased during the first month of contraceptive use and remains constant for several years or more. The risk returns to normal within a month when use is discontinued. The risk of venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism is increased among women with predisposing conditions such as stasis, altered clotting factors such as antithrombin III, increased levels of homocysteine, or injury. Genetic disorders, including mutations in the genes governing the production of protein C (factor V Leiden), protein S, hepatic cofactor II, and others, markedly increase the risk of venous thromboembolism. The incidence of these disorders is too low for cost-effective screening by current methods, but prior episodes or a family history may be helpful in identifying patients with increased risk.

The incidence of venous thromboembolism appears to be related to the estrogen but not the progestin content of oral contraceptives and is not related to age, parity, mild obesity, or cigarette smoking. Decreased venous blood flow, endothelial proliferation in veins and arteries, and increased coagulability of blood resulting from changes in platelet functions and fibrinolytic systems contribute to the increased incidence of thrombosis. The major plasma inhibitor of thrombin, antithrombin III, is substantially decreased during oral contraceptive use. This change occurs in the first month of treatment and lasts as long as treatment persists, reversing within a month thereafter.

\section*{MYOCARDI AL I NFARCTI ON}

The use of oral contraceptives is associated with a slightly higher risk of myocardial infarction in women who are obese, have a history of preeclampsia or hypertension, or have hyperlipoproteinemia or diabetes. There is a much higher risk in women who smoke. The risk attributable to oral contraceptives in women 30-40 years of age who do not smoke is about 4 cases per 100,000 users per year, as compared with 185 cases per 100,000 among women 40-44 who smoke heavily. The association with myocardial infarction is thought to involve acceleration of atherogenesis because of decreased glucose tolerance, decreased levels of HDL, increased levels of LDL, and increased platelet aggregation. In addition, facilitation of coronary arterial spasm may play a role in some of these patients. The progestational component of oral contraceptives decreases HDL cholesterol levels, in proportion to the androgenic activity of the progestin. The net effect, therefore, will depend on the specific composition of the pill used and the patient's susceptibility to the particular effects. Recent studies
suggest that risk of infarction is not increased in past users who have discontinued oral contraceptives.

\section*{CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE}

The risk of strokes is concentrated in women over age 35. It is increased in current users of oral contraceptives but not in past users. However, subarachnoid hemorrhages have been found to be increased among both current and past users and may increase with time. The risk of thrombotic or hemorrhagic stroke attributable to oral contraceptives (based on older, higher-dose preparations) has been estimated to about 37 cases per 100,000 users per year.

In summary, available data indicate that oral contraceptives increase the risk of various cardiovascular disorders at all ages and among both smokers and nonsmokers. However, this risk appears to be concentrated in women 35 years of age or older who are heavy smokers. It is clear that these risk factors must be considered in each individual patient for whom oral contraceptives are being considered. Some experts have suggested that screening for coagulopathy should be performed before starting oral contraception.

\section*{Gastrointestinal Disorders}

Many cases of cholestatic jaundice have been reported in patients taking progestin-containing drugs. The differences in incidence of these disorders from one population to another suggest that genetic factors may be involved. The jaundice caused by these agents is similar to that produced by other 17-alkyl-substituted steroids. It is most often observed in the first three cycles and is particularly common in women with a history of cholestatic jaundice during pregnancy. Jaundice and pruritus disappear 1-8 weeks after the drug is discontinued.

These agents have also been found to increase the incidence of symptomatic gallbladder disease, including cholecystitis and cholangitis. This is probably the result of the alterations responsible for jaundice and bile acid changes described above.

It also appears that the incidence of hepatic adenomas is increased in women taking oral contraceptives. Ischemic bowel disease secondary to thrombosis of the celiac and superior and inferior mesenteric arteries and veins has also been reported in women using these drugs.

\section*{Depression}

Depression of sufficient degree to require cessation of therapy occurs in about 6\% of patients treated with some preparations.

\section*{Cancer}

The occurrence of malignant tumors in patients taking oral contraceptives has been studied extensively. It is now clear that these compounds reduce the risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer. The lifetime risk of breast cancer in the population as a whole does not seem to be affected by oral contraceptive use. Some studies have shown an increased risk in younger women, and it is possible that tumors that develop in younger women become clinically apparent sooner. The relation of risk of cervical cancer to oral contraceptive use is still controversial. It should be noted that a number of recent studies associate the use of oral contraceptives by women with cervical infection with the human papillomavirus to an increased risk of cervical cancer.

\section*{Other}

In addition to the above effects, a number of other adverse reactions have been reported for which a causal relation has not been established. These include alopecia, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, and other skin disorders.

\section*{Contraindications \& Cautions}

These drugs are contraindicated in patients with thrombophlebitis, thromboembolic phenomena, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders or a past history of these conditions. They should not be used to treat vaginal bleeding when the cause is unknown. They should be avoided in patients with known or suspected tumors of the breast or other estrogen-dependent neoplasms. Since these preparations have caused aggravation of preexisting disorders, they should be avoided or used with caution in patients with liver disease, asthma, eczema, migraine, diabetes, hypertension, optic neuritis, retrobulbar neuritis, or convulsive disorders.

The oral contraceptives may produce edema, and for that reason they should be used with great caution in patients in heart failure or in whom edema is otherwise undesirable or dangerous.

Estrogens may increase the rate of growth of fibroids. Therefore, for women with these tumors, agents with the smallest amounts of estrogen and the most androgenic progestins should be selected. The use of progestational agents alone for contraception might be especially useful in such patients (see below).

These agents are contraindicated in adolescents in whom epiphysial closure has not yet been completed.
Women using oral contraceptives must be made aware of an important interaction that occurs with antimicrobial drugs. Because the normal gastrointestinal flora increases the enterohepatic cycling (and bioavailability) of estrogens, antimicrobial drugs that interfere with these organisms may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives. Additionally, coadministration with potent inducers of the hepatic microsomal metabolizing enzymes, such as rifampin, may increase liver catabolism of estrogens or progestins and diminish the efficacy of oral contraceptives.

\section*{Contraception with Progestins Alone}

Small doses of progestins administered orally or by implantation under the skin can be used for contraception. They are particularly suited for use in patients for whom estrogen administration is undesirable. They are about as effective as intrauterine devices or combination pills containing $20-30 \mathrm{mcg}$ of ethinyl estradiol. There is a high incidence of abnormal bleeding.

Effective contraception can also be achieved by injecting 150 mg of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) every 3 months. After a 150 mg dose, ovulation is inhibited for at least 14 weeks. Almost all users experience episodes of unpredictable spotting and bleeding, particularly during the first year of use. Spotting and bleeding decrease with time, and amenorrhea is common. This preparation is not desirable for women planning a pregnancy soon after cessation of therapy because ovulation suppression can sometimes persist for as long as 18 months after the last injection. Long-term DMPA use reduces menstrual blood loss and is associated with a decreased risk of endometrial cancer. Suppression of endogenous estrogen secretion may be associated with a reversible reduction in bone density, and changes in plasma lipids are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis.

The progestin implant method utilizes the subcutaneous implantation of capsules containing a progestin. These capsules release one fifth to one third as much steroid as oral agents, are extremely effective, and last for 5-6 years (Norplant) or 2-4 years (Implanon). The low levels of hormone have little effect on lipoprotein and carbohydrate metabolism or blood pressure. The disadvantages include the need for surgical insertion and removal of capsules and some irregular bleeding rather than predictable menses. An association of intracranial hypertension with implanted norgestrel has been observed in a small number of women. Patients experiencing
headache or visual disturbances should be checked for papilledema.
Contraception with progestins is useful in patients with hepatic disease, hypertension, psychosis or mental retardation, or prior thromboembolism. The side effects include headache, dizziness, bloating and weight gain of $1-2 \mathrm{~kg}$, and a reversible reduction of glucose tolerance.

\section*{Postcoital Contraceptives}

Pregnancy can be prevented following coitus by the administration of estrogens alone or in combination with progestins ("morning after" contraception). When treatment is begun within 72 hours, it is effective $99 \%$ of the time. Some effective schedules are shown in Table 40-4. The hormones are often administered with antiemetics, since $40 \%$ of the patients have nausea or vomiting. Other adverse effects include headache, dizziness, breast tenderness, and abdominal and leg cramps.

\section*{Table 40-4. Schedules for Use of Postcoital Contraceptives.}

Conjugated estrogens: 10 mg three times daily for 5 days
Ethinyl estradiol: 2.5 mg twice daily for 5 days
Diethylstilbestrol: 50 mg daily for 5 days
Mifepristone, 600 mg once with misoprostol, 400 mcg once ${ }^{1}$

L - Norgestrel: 0.75 mg twice daily for 1 day (eg, Plan B ${ }^{2}$ )

Norgestrel, 0.5 mg , with ethinyl estradiol, 0.05 mg (eg, Ovral, Preven ${ }^{2}$ ): Two tablets and then two in 12 hours
${ }^{1}$ Mifepristone given on day 1 , misoprostol on day 3 .
2 Sold as emergency contraceptive kits.

Mifepristone (RU 486), an antagonist at progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors, has a luteolytic effect and is effective as a postcoital contraceptive. When combined with a prostaglandin it is also an effective abortifacient.

\section*{Beneficial Effects of Oral Contraceptives}

It has become apparent that reduction in the dose of the constituents of oral contraceptives has markedly reduced mild and severe adverse effects, providing a relatively safe and convenient method of contraception for many young women. Treatment with oral contraceptives has also been shown to be associated with many benefits unrelated to contraception. These include a reduced risk of ovarian cysts, ovarian and endometrial cancer, and benign breast disease. There is a lower incidence of ectopic pregnancy. Iron deficiency and rheumatoid arthritis are less common, and premenstrual symptoms, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, acne, and hirsutism may be ameliorated with their use.
Estrogen \& Progesterone Inhibitors \& Antagonists TAMOXIFEN \& RELATED PARTIAL AGONIST ESTROGENS

Tamoxifen, a competitive partial agonist inhibitor of estradiol at the estrogen receptor (Figure 40-5), was the first selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) to be introduced. It is extensively used in the palliative treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women and is approved for chemoprevention of breast cancer in high-risk women (see Chapter 55). It is a nonsteroidal agent (see structure below) that is given orally. Peak plasma levels are reached in a few hours. Tamoxifen has an initial half-life of $7-14$ hours in the circulation and is predominantly excreted by the liver. It is used in doses of 10-20 mg twice daily. Hot flushes and nausea and vomiting occur in $25 \%$ of patients, and many other minor adverse effects are observed. Studies of patients treated with tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer have shown a $35 \%$ decrease in contralateral breast cancer. However, adjuvant therapy extended beyond 5 years in patients with breast cancer has shown no further improvement in outcome. Toremifene is a structurally similar compound with very similar properties, indications, and toxicities.

Control of ovarian secretion and the actions of its hormones. In the follicular phase the ovary produces mainly estrogens; in the luteal phase it produces estrogens and progesterone. (SERMs, selective estrogen receptor modulators. See text.)

Prevention of the expected loss of lumbar spine bone density and plasma lipid changes consistent with a reduction in the risk for atherosclerosis have also been reported in tamoxifen-treated patients following spontaneous or surgical menopause. However, this agonist activity also affects the uterus and may increase the risk of endometrial cancer.

Raloxifene is another partial estrogen agonist-antagonist (SERM) at some but not all target tissues. It has similar effects on lipids and bone but appears not to stimulate the endometrium or breast. Although subject to a high first-pass effect, raloxifene has a very large volume of distribution and a long half-life (> 24 hours), so it can be taken once a day. Raloxifene has been approved in the USA for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Clomiphene is an older partial agonist, a weak estrogen that also acts as a competitive inhibitor of endogenous estrogens (Figure 40-5). It has found use as an ovulation-inducing agent (see below).

\section*{MIFEPRISTONE}

Mifepristone (RU 486) is a "19-norsteroid" that binds strongly to the progesterone receptor and inhibits the activity of progesterone. The drug has luteolytic properties in $80 \%$ of women when given in the midluteal period. The mechanism of this effect is unknown, but it may provide the basis for using mifepristone as a contraceptive (as opposed to an abortifacient). However, because the compound has a long half-life, large doses may prolong the follicular phase of the subsequent cycle and so make it difficult to use continuously for this purpose. A single dose of 600 mg is an effective emergency postcoital contraceptive, though it may result in delayed ovulation in the following cycle. As noted in Chapter 39, the drug also binds to and acts as an antagonist at the glucocorticoid receptor. Limited clinical studies suggest that mifepristone or other analogs with similar properties may be useful in the treatment of endometriosis, Cushing's syndrome, breast cancer, and possibly other neoplasms such as meningiomas that contain glucocorticoid or progesterone receptors.

Mifepristone

Mifepristone's major use thus far has been to terminate early pregnancies. Doses of $400-600 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ for 4 days or $800 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ for 2 days successfully terminated pregnancy in over $85 \%$ of the women studied. The major adverse effect was prolonged bleeding that on most occasions did not require treatment. The combination of a single oral dose of 600 mg of mifepristone and a vaginal pessary containing 1 mg of prostaglandin $\mathrm{E}_{1}$ or oral misoprostol has been found to effectively terminate pregnancy in over 95\% of patients treated during the first 7 weeks after conception. The adverse effects of the medications included vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal or pelvic pain. As many as 5\% of patients have vaginal bleeding requiring intervention. Because of these
adverse effects, RU 486 is administered only by physicians at family planning centers. In a very small number of cases, use of a vaginal tablet for the prostaglandin dose has been associated with sepsis, so it is recommended that both drugs be given by mouth in all patients.

ZK 98734 (lilopristone) is a potent experimental progesterone inhibitor and abortifacient in doses of 25 mg twice daily. Like mifepristone, it also appears to have antiglucocorticoid activity.

\section*{DANAZOL}

Danazol, an isoxazole derivative of ethisterone (17-ethinyltestosterone) with weak progestational, androgenic, and glucocorticoid activities, is used to suppress ovarian function. Danazol inhibits the midcycle surge of LH and FSH and can prevent the compensatory increase in LH and FSH following castration in animals, but it does not significantly lower or suppress basal LH or FSH levels in normal women (Figure 40-5). Danazol binds to androgen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptors and can translocate the androgen receptor into the nucleus to initiate androgen-specific RNA synthesis. It does not bind to intracellular estrogen receptors, but it does bind to sex hormone-binding and corticosteroid-binding globulins. It inhibits P450scc (the cholesterol side chain-cleaving enzyme), 3B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, P450c17 (17.-hydroxylase), P450c11 (11B-hydroxylase), and P450c21 (21B-hydroxylase). However, it does not inhibit aromatase, the enzyme required for estrogen synthesis. It increases the mean clearance of progesterone, probably by competing with the hormone for binding proteins, and may have similar effects on other active steroid hormones. Ethisterone, a major metabolite of danazol, has both progestational and mild androgenic effects.

Danazol is slowly metabolized in humans, having a half-life of over 15 hours. This results in stable circulating levels when the drug is administered twice daily. It is highly concentrated in the liver, adrenals, and kidneys and is excreted in both feces and urine.

Danazol has been employed as an inhibitor of gonadal function and has found its major use in the treatment of endometriosis. For this purpose, it can be given in a dosage of $600 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. The dosage is reduced to $400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ after 1 month and to $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ in 2 months. About $85 \%$ of patients show marked improvement in 3-12 months.

Danazol has also been used in the treatment of fibrocystic disease of the breast and hematologic or allergic disorders, including hemophilia, Christmas disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and angioneurotic edema.

The major adverse effects are weight gain, edema, decreased breast size, acne and oily skin, increased hair growth, deepening of the voice, headache, hot flushes, changes in libido, and muscle cramps. Although mild adverse effects are very common, it is seldom necessary to discontinue the drug because of them. Occasionally, because of its inherent glucocorticoid activity, danazol may cause adrenal suppression.

Danazol should be used with great caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction, since it has been reported to produce mild to moderate hepatocellular damage in some patients, as evidenced by enzyme changes. It is also contraindicated during pregnancy and breast feeding, as it may produce urogenital abnormalities in the offspring.

\section*{OTHER I NHI BI TORS}

Anastrozole, a selective nonsteroidal inhibitor of aromatase (the enzyme required for estrogen synthesis,

Figures 40-2, 40-5), is effective in some women whose breast tumors have become resistant to tamoxifen (see Chapter 55). Letrozole is similar. Exemestane, a steroid molecule, is an irreversible inhibitor of aromatase. Like anastrazole and letrozole, it is approved for use in women with advanced breast cancer (see Chapter 55).

Several other aromatase inhibitors are undergoing clinical trials in patients with breast cancer. Fadrozole is a newer oral nonsteroidal (triazole) inhibitor of aromatase activity. These compounds appear to be as effective as tamoxifen. In addition to their use in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors have been successfully employed as adjuncts to androgen antagonists in the treatment of precocious puberty and as primary treatment in the excessive aromatase syndrome.

Fulvestrant is a pure estrogen receptor antagonist that has been somewhat more effective than those with partial agonist effects in some patients who have become resistant to tamoxifen. ICI 164,384 is a newer antagonist; it inhibits dimerization of the occupied estrogen receptor and interferes with its binding to DNA. It has also been used experimentally in breast cancer patients who have become resistant to tamoxifen.

GnRH and its analogs (nafarelin, buserelin, etc) have become important in both stimulating and inhibiting ovarian function. They are discussed in Chapter 37.

\section*{Ovulation-I nducing Agents}

\section*{CLOMI PHENE}

Clomiphene citrate, a partial estrogen agonist, is closely related to the estrogen chlorotrianisene (Figure 40-3). This compound is active when taken orally. Very little is known about its metabolism, but about half of the compound is excreted in the feces within 5 days after administration. It has been suggested that clomiphene is slowly excreted from an enterohepatic pool.

\section*{Pharmacologic Effects}

\section*{MECHANISMS OF ACTION}

Clomiphene is a partial agonist at estrogen receptors. The estrogenic agonist effects are best demonstrated in animals with marked gonadal deficiency. Clomiphene has also been shown to effectively inhibit the action of stronger estrogens. In humans it leads to an increase in the secretion of gonadotropins and estrogens by inhibiting estradiol's negative feedback effect on the gonadotropins (Figure 40-5).

\section*{EFFECTS}

The pharmacologic importance of this compound rests on its ability to stimulate ovulation in women with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea and ovulatory dysfunction. The majority of patients suffer from polycystic ovary syndrome, a common disorder affecting about 7\% of women of reproductive age. The syndrome is characterized by gonadotropin-dependent ovarian hyperandrogenism associated with anovulation and infertility. The disorder is frequently accompanied by adrenal hyperandrogenism. Clomiphene probably blocks the feedback inhibitory influence of estrogens on the hypothalamus, causing a surge of gonadotropins, which leads to ovulation.

\section*{Clinical Use}

Clomiphene is used in the treatment of disorders of ovulation in patients who wish to become pregnant. Usually, a single ovulation is induced by a single course of therapy, and the patient must be treated repeatedly until pregnancy is achieved, since normal ovulatory function does not usually resume. The compound is of no
value in patients with ovarian or pituitary failure.
When clomiphene is administered in doses of $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ for 5 days, a rise in plasma LH and FSH is observed after several days. In patients who ovulate, the initial rise is followed by a second rise of gonadotropin levels just prior to ovulation.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

The most common adverse effects in patients treated with this drug are hot flushes, which resemble those experienced by menopausal patients. They tend to be mild, and disappear when the drug is discontinued. There have been occasional reports of eye symptoms due to intensification and prolongation of afterimages. These are generally of short duration. Headache, constipation, allergic skin reactions, and reversible hair loss have been reported occasionally.

The effective use of clomiphene is associated with some stimulation of the ovaries and usually with ovarian enlargement. The degree of enlargement tends to be greater and its incidence higher in patients who have enlarged ovaries at the beginning of therapy.

A variety of other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, increased nervous tension, depression, fatigue, breast soreness, weight gain, urinary frequency, and heavy menses have also been reported. However, these appear to result from the hormonal changes associated with an ovulatory menstrual cycle rather than from the medication. The incidence of multiple pregnancy is approximately $10 \%$. Clomiphene has not been shown to have an adverse effect when inadvertently given to women who are already pregnant.

\section*{Contraindications \& Cautions}

Special precautions should be observed in patients with enlarged ovaries. These women are thought to be more sensitive to this drug and should receive small doses. Any patient who complains of abdominal symptoms should be examined carefully. Maximum ovarian enlargement occurs after the 5 -day course has been completed, and many patients can be shown to have a palpable increase in ovarian size by the seventh to tenth days. Treatment with clomiphene for more than a year may be associated with an increased risk for lowgrade ovarian cancer; however, the evidence for this effect is not conclusive.

Special precautions must also be taken in patients who have visual symptoms associated with clomiphene therapy, since these symptoms may make activities such as driving more hazardous.

\section*{Other Drugs Used in Ovulatory Disorders}

In addition to clomiphene, a variety of other hormonal and nonhormonal agents are used in treating anovulatory disorders. They are discussed in Chapter 37.

\section*{THE TESTIS (ANDROGENS \& ANABOLI C STEROI DS, ANTI ANDROGENS, \& MALE CONTRACEPTION)}

The testis, like the ovary, has both gametogenic and endocrine functions. The onset of gametogenic function of the testes is controlled largely by the secretion of FSH by the pituitary. High concentrations of testosterone locally are also required for continuing sperm production in the seminiferous tubules. The Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules may be the source of the estradiol produced in the testes via aromatization of locally produced testosterone. With LH stimulation, testosterone is produced by the interstitial or Leydig cells found in the spaces between the seminiferous tubules.

The Sertoli cells in the testis synthesize and secrete a variety of active proteins, including müllerian duct inhibitory factor, inhibin, and activin. As in the ovary, inhibin and activin appear to be the product of three genes that produce a common asubunit and two Bsubunits, A and B. Activin is composed of the two Bsubunits ( $B_{A} B_{B}$ ). There are two inhibins ( $A$ and $B$ ), which contain the asubunit and one of the Bsubunits. Activin stimulates pituitary FSH release and is structurally similar to transforming growth factor- $B$, which also increases FSH. The inhibins in conjunction with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone are responsible for the feedback inhibition of pituitary FSH secretion.

\section*{Androgens \& Anabolic Steroids}

In humans, the most important androgen secreted by the testis is testosterone. The pathways of synthesis of testosterone in the testes are similar to those previously described for the adrenal and ovary (Figures 39-1 and 40-2).

In men, approximately 8 mg of testosterone is produced daily. About 95\% is produced by the Leydig cells and only $5 \%$ by the adrenal. The testis also secretes small amounts of another potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone, as well as androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone, which are weak androgens. Pregnenolone and progesterone and their 17-hydroxylated derivatives are also released in small amounts. Plasma levels of testosterone in males are about $0.6 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$ after puberty and appear to decline after age 50. Testosterone is also present in the plasma of women in concentrations of approximately $0.03 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{dL}$ and is derived in approximately equal parts from the ovaries and adrenals and by the peripheral conversion of other hormones.

About 65\% of circulating testosterone is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin. SHBG is increased in plasma by estrogen, by thyroid hormone, and in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. It is decreased by androgen and growth hormone and is lower in obese individuals. Most of the remaining testosterone is bound to albumin. Approximately $2 \%$ remains free and available to enter cells and bind to intracellular receptors.

\section*{Metabolism}

In many target tissues, testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone by 5a-reductase. In these tissues, dihydrotestosterone is the major active androgen. The conversion of testosterone to estradiol by P450 aromatase also occurs in some tissues, including adipose tissue, liver, and the hypothalamus, where it may be of importance in regulating gonadal function.

The major pathway for the degradation of testosterone in humans occurs in the liver, with the reduction of the double bond and ketone in the A ring, as is seen in other steroids with a $\Delta^{4}$-ketone configuration in the A ring. This leads to the production of inactive substances such as androsterone and etiocholanolone that are then conjugated and excreted in the urine.

Androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) are also produced in significant amounts in humans, although largely in the adrenal rather than in the testes. They contribute slightly to the normal maturation process supporting other androgen-dependent pubertal changes in the human, primarily development of pubic and axillary hair and bone maturation. As noted in Chapter 39, some studies suggest that DHEA and DHEAS may have other central nervous system and metabolic effects and may prolong life in rabbits. In men they may improve the sense of well-being and inhibit atherosclerosis. In a recent placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, DHEA demonstrated some beneficial effects (see Adrenal Androgens, Chapter 39). Adrenal androgens are to a large extent
metabolized in the same fashion as testosterone. Both steroids-but particularly androstenedione-can be converted by peripheral tissues to estrone in very small amounts (1-5\%). The P450 aromatase enzyme responsible for this conversion is also found in the brain and is thought to play an important role in development.

\section*{Physiologic Effects}

In the normal male, testosterone or its active metabolite 5a-dihydrotestosterone is responsible for the many changes that occur in puberty. In addition to the general growth-promoting properties of androgens on body tissues, these hormones are responsible for penile and scrotal growth. Changes in the skin include the appearance of pubic, axillary, and beard hair. The sebaceous glands become more active, and the skin tends to become thicker and oilier. The larynx grows and the vocal cords become thicker, leading to a lower-pitched voice. Skeletal growth is stimulated and epiphysial closure accelerated. Other effects include growth of the prostate and seminal vesicles, darkening of the skin, and increased skin circulation. Androgens play an important role in stimulating and maintaining sexual function in men. Androgens increase lean body mass and stimulate body hair growth and sebum secretion. Metabolic effects include the reduction of hormone binding and other carrier proteins and increased liver synthesis of clotting factors, triglyceride lipase, $a_{1}$-antitrypsin, haptoglobin, and sialic acid. They also stimulate renal erythropoietin secretion and decrease HDL levels.

\section*{Synthetic Steroids with Androgenic \& Anabolic Action}

Testosterone, when administered by mouth, is rapidly absorbed. However, it is largely converted to inactive metabolites, and only about one sixth of the dose administered is available in active form. Testosterone can be administered parenterally, but it has a more prolonged absorption time and greater activity in the propionate, enanthate, undecanoate, or cypionate ester forms. These derivatives are hydrolyzed to release free testosterone at the site of injection. Testosterone derivatives alkylated at the 17 position, eg, methyltestosterone and fluoxymesterone, are active when given by mouth.

Testosterone and its derivatives have been used for their anabolic effects as well as in the treatment of testosterone deficiency. Although testosterone and other known active steroids can be isolated in pure form and measured by weight, biologic assays are still used in the investigation of new compounds. In some of these studies in animals, the anabolic effects of the compound as measured by trophic effects on muscles or the reduction of nitrogen excretion may be dissociated from the other androgenic effects. This has led to the marketing of compounds claimed to have anabolic activity associated with only weak androgenic effects. Unfortunately, this dissociation is less marked in humans than in the animals used for testing (Table 40-5), and all are potent androgens.

\section*{Pharmacologic Effects}

\section*{MECHANISMS OF ACTION}

Like other steroids, testosterone acts intracellularly in target cells. In skin, prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis, it is converted to 5 -dihydrotestosterone by 5 -reductase. In these tissues, dihydrotestosterone is the dominant androgen. The distribution of this enzyme in the fetus is different and has important developmental implications.

Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone bind to the intracellular androgen receptor, initiating a series of events similar to those described above for estradiol and progesterone, leading to growth, differentiation, and synthesis of a variety of enzymes and other functional proteins.

\section*{EFFECTS}

In the male at puberty, androgens cause development of the secondary sex characteristics (see above). In the adult male, large doses of testosterone-when given alone-or its derivatives suppress the secretion of gonadotropins and result in some atrophy of the interstitial tissue and the tubules of the testes. Since fairly large doses of androgens are required to suppress gonadotropin secretion, it has been postulated that inhibin, in combination with androgens, is responsible for the feedback control of secretion. In women, androgens are capable of producing changes similar to those observed in the prepubertal male. These include growth of facial and body hair, deepening of the voice, enlargement of the clitoris, frontal baldness, and prominent musculature. The natural androgens stimulate erythrocyte production.

The administration of androgens reduces the excretion of nitrogen into the urine, indicating an increase in protein synthesis or a decrease in protein breakdown within the body. This effect is much more pronounced in women and children than in normal men.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{ANDROGEN REPLACEMENT THERAPY IN MEN}

Androgens are used to replace or augment endogenous androgen secretion in hypogonadal men (Table 40-6). Even in the presence of pituitary deficiency, androgens are used rather than gonadotropin except when normal spermatogenesis is to be achieved. In patients with hypopituitarism, androgens are not added to the treatment regimen until puberty, at which time they are instituted in gradually increasing doses to achieve the growth spurt and the development of secondary sex characteristics. In these patients, therapy should be started with long-acting agents such as testosterone enanthate or cypionate in doses of 50 mg intramuscularly, initially every 4, then every 3, and finally every 2 weeks, with each change taking place at 3month intervals. The dose is then doubled to 100 mg every 2 weeks until maturation is complete. Finally, it is changed to the adult replacement dose of 200 mg at 2-week intervals. Testosterone propionate, though potent, has a short duration of action and is not practical for long-term use. Testosterone undecanoate can be given orally, administering large amounts of the steroid twice daily (eg, $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ); however, this is not recommended because oral testosterone administration has been associated with liver tumors. Testosterone can also be administered transdermally; skin patches or gels are available for scrotal or other skin area application. Two applications daily are usually required for replacement therapy. Implanted pellets and other longer-acting preparations are under study. The development of polycythemia or hypertension may require some reduction in dose.

\section*{GYNECOLOGIC DISORDERS}

Androgens are used occasionally in the treatment of certain gynecologic disorders, but the undesirable effects in women are such that they must be used with great caution. Androgens have been used to reduce breast engorgement during the postpartum period, usually in conjunction with estrogens. The weak androgen danazol is used in the treatment of endometriosis (see above).

Androgens are sometimes given in combination with estrogens for replacement therapy in the postmenopausal period in an attempt to eliminate the endometrial bleeding that may occur when only estrogens are used and to enhance libido. They have been used for chemotherapy of breast tumors in premenopausal women.

\section*{USE AS PROTEIN ANABOLIC AGENTS}

Androgens and anabolic steroids have been used in conjunction with dietary measures and exercises in an attempt to reverse protein loss after trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobilization and in patients with debilitating diseases.

\section*{ANEMIA}

In the past, large doses of androgens were employed in the treatment of refractory anemias such as aplastic anemia, Fanconi's anemia, sickle cell anemia, myelofibrosis, and hemolytic anemias. Recombinant erythropoietin has largely replaced androgens for this purpose.

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS}

Androgens and anabolic agents have been used in the treatment of osteoporosis, either alone or in conjunction with estrogens. With the exception of substitution therapy in hypogonadism, bisphosphonates have largely replaced androgen use for this purpose.

\section*{USE AS GROWTH STI MULATORS}

These agents have been used to stimulate growth in boys with delayed puberty. If the drugs are used carefully, these children will probably achieve their expected adult height. If treatment is too vigorous, the patient may grow rapidly at first but will not achieve full predicted final stature because of the accelerated epiphysial closure that occurs. It is difficult to control this type of therapy adequately even with frequent x-ray examination of the epiphyses, since the action of the hormones on epiphysial centers may continue for many months after therapy is discontinued.

\section*{ANABOLIC STEROID AND ANDROGEN ABUSE IN SPORTS}

The use of anabolic steroids by athletes has received worldwide attention. Many athletes and their coaches believe that anabolic steroids-in doses 10-200 times larger than the daily normal production-increase strength and aggressiveness, thereby improving competitive performance. Such effects have been unequivocally demonstrated only in women. Furthermore, the adverse effects of these drugs clearly make their use inadvisable.

\section*{AGI NG}

Androgen production falls with age in men and may contribute to the decline in muscle mass, strength, and libido. Preliminary studies of androgen replacement in aging males with low androgen levels show an increase
in lean body mass and hematocrit and a decrease in bone turnover. Longer studies will be required to assess the usefulness of this therapy.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

The adverse effects of these compounds are due largely to their masculinizing actions and are most noticeable in women and prepubertal children. In women, the administration of more than 200-300 mg of testosterone per month is usually associated with hirsutism, acne, amenorrhea, clitoral enlargement, and deepening of the voice. These effects may occur with even smaller doses in some women. Some of the androgenic steroids exert progestational activity, leading to endometrial bleeding upon discontinuation. These hormones also alter serum lipids and could conceivably increase susceptibility to atherosclerotic disease in women.

Except under the most unusual circumstances, androgens should not be used in infants. Recent studies in animals suggest that administration of androgens in early life may have profound effects on maturation of central nervous system centers governing sexual development, particularly in the female. Administration of these drugs to pregnant women may lead to masculinization or undermasculinization of the external genitalia in the female and male fetus, respectively. Although the above-mentioned effects may be less marked with the anabolic agents, they do occur.

Sodium retention and edema are not common but must be carefully watched for in patients with heart and kidney disease.

Most of the synthetic androgens and anabolic agents are 17-alkyl-substituted steroids. Administration of drugs with this structure is often associated with evidence of hepatic dysfunction. Hepatic dysfunction usually occurs early in the course of treatment, and the degree is proportionate to the dose. Bilirubin levels occasionally increase until clinical jaundice is apparent. The cholestatic jaundice is reversible upon cessation of therapy, and permanent changes do not occur. In older males, prostatic hyperplasia may develop, causing urinary retention.

Replacement therapy in men may cause acne, sleep apnea, erythrocytosis, gynecomastia, and azoospermia. Supraphysiologic doses of androgens produce azoospermia and decrease in testicular size, both of which may take months to recover after cessation of therapy. The alkylated androgens in high doses can produce peliosis hepatica, cholestasis, and hepatic failure. They lower plasma HDL2 and may increase LDL. Hepatic adenomas and carcinomas have also been reported. Behavioral effects include psychologic dependence, increased aggressiveness, and psychotic symptoms.

\section*{Contraindications \& Cautions}

The use of androgenic steroids is contraindicated in pregnant women or women who may become pregnant during the course of therapy.

Androgens should not be administered to male patients with carcinoma of the prostate or breast. Until more is known about the effects of these hormones on the central nervous system in developing children, they should be avoided in infants and young children.

Special caution is required in giving these drugs to children to produce a growth spurt. In most patients, the use of somatotropin is more appropriate (see Chapter 37).

Care should be exercised in the administration of these drugs to patients with renal or cardiac disease predisposed to edema. If sodium and water retention occurs, it will respond to diuretic therapy.

Methyltestosterone therapy is associated with creatinuria, but the significance of this finding is not known.

Caution: Several cases of hepatocellular carcinoma have been reported in patients with aplastic anemia treated with androgen anabolic therapy. Colony-stimulating factors (see Chapter 33) should be used instead.

\section*{Androgen Suppression \& Antiandrogens}

\section*{ANDROGEN SUPPRESSION}

The treatment of advanced prostatic carcinoma often requires orchiectomy or large doses of estrogens to reduce available endogenous androgen. The psychologic effects of the former and gynecomastia produced by the latter make these approaches undesirable. As noted in Chapter 37, the GnRH analogs such as goserelin, nafarelin, buserelin, and leuprolide acetate produce gonadal suppression when blood levels are continuous rather than pulsatile (see Chapter 37 and Figure 40-6).
Figure 40-6.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-1243.jpg?height=2120&width=839&top_left_y=184&top_left_x=670)

Control of androgen secretion and activity and some sites of action of antiandrogens. (1), competitive inhibition of GnRH
receptors; (2), stimulation (+, pulsatile administration) or inhibition via desensitization of GnRH receptors (-, continuous administration); (3), decreased synthesis of testosterone in the testis; (4), decreased synthesis of dihydrotestosterone by inhibition of 5x-reductase; (5), competition for binding to cytosol androgen receptors.

\section*{ANTI ANDROGENS}

The potential usefulness of antiandrogens in the treatment of patients producing excessive amounts of testosterone has led to the search for effective drugs that can be used for this purpose. Several approaches to the problem, especially inhibition of synthesis and receptor antagonism, have met with some success.

\section*{Steroid Synthesis Inhibitors}

Ketoconazole, used primarily in the treatment of fungal disease, is an inhibitor of adrenal and gonadal steroid synthesis, as described in Chapter 39. It does not affect ovarian aromatase, but it reduces human placental aromatase activity. It displaces estradiol and dihydrotestosterone from sex hormone-binding protein in vitro and increases the estradiol: testosterone ratio in plasma in vivo by a different mechanism. However, it does not appear to be clinically useful in women with increased androgens because of the toxicity associated with prolonged use of the $400-800 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ required. The drug has also been used experimentally to treat prostatic carcinoma, but the results have not been encouraging. Men treated with ketoconazole often develop reversible gynecomastia during therapy; this may be due to the demonstrated increase in the estradiol:testosterone ratio.

\section*{Conversion of Steroid Precursors to Androgens}

Several compounds have been developed that inhibit the 17-hydroxylation of progesterone or pregnenolone, thereby preventing the action of the side chain-splitting enzyme and the further transformation of these steroid precursors to active androgens. A few of these compounds have been tested clinically but have been too toxic for prolonged use.

Since dihydrotestosterone-not testosterone-appears to be the essential androgen in the prostate, androgen effects in this and similar dihydrotestosterone-dependent tissues can be reduced by an inhibitor of 5areductase (Figure 40-6). Finasteride, a steroid-like inhibitor of this enzyme, is orally active and causes a reduction in dihydrotestosterone levels that begins within 8 hours after administration and lasts for about 24 hours. The half-life is about 8 hours (longer in elderly individuals). Forty to 50 percent of the dose is metabolized; more than half is excreted in the feces. Finasteride has been reported to be moderately effective in reducing prostate size in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and is approved for this use in the USA. The dosage is $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. Its use in advanced prostatic carcinoma is under study. The drug is not approved for use in women or children, although it has been used successfully in the treatment of hirsutism in women and early male pattern baldness in men ( $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ).
<smiles>CNC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4NC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3CCC12C</smiles>

\section*{Receptor Inhibitors}

Cyproterone and cyproterone acetate are effective antiandrogens that inhibit the action of androgens at the target organ. The acetate form has a marked progestational effect that suppresses the feedback enhancement of LH and FSH, leading to a more effective antiandrogen effect. These compounds have been used in women to treat hirsutism and in men to decrease excessive sexual drive and are being studied in other conditions in which the reduction of androgenic effects would be useful. Cyproterone acetate in a dosage of 2 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ administered concurrently with an estrogen is used in the treatment of hirsutism in women, doubling as a contraceptive pill; it has orphan drug status in the USA.

Flutamide, a substituted anilide, is a potent antiandrogen that has been used in the treatment of prostatic carcinoma. Although not a steroid, it behaves like a competitive antagonist at the androgen receptor. It is rapidly metabolized in humans. It frequently causes mild gynecomastia (probably by increasing testicular estrogen production) and occasionally causes mild reversible hepatic toxicity. Administration of this compound causes some improvement in most patients who have not had prior endocrine therapy. Preliminary studies indicate that flutamide is also useful in the management of excess androgen effect in women.
<smiles>CC(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c(C(F)(F)F)c1</smiles>

Flutamide

Bicalutamide and nilutamide are potent orally active antiandrogens that can be administered as a single daily dose and are used in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the prostate. Studies in patients with carcinoma of the prostate indicate that these agents are well tolerated. Bicalutamide is recommended for use in combination with a GnRH analog (to reduce tumor flare) and may have fewer gastrointestinal side effects than flutamide. A dosage of $150-200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ (when used alone) is required to reduce prostate-specific antigen levels to those achieved by castration, but, in combination with a GnRH analog, $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ may be adequate. Nilutamide is approved for use following surgical castration in a dosage of $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ for 30 days followed by $150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$.

Spironolactone, a competitive inhibitor of aldosterone (see Chapter 15), also competes with dihydrotestosterone for the androgen receptors in target tissues. It also reduces 17.-hydroxylase activity, lowering plasma levels of testosterone and androstenedione. It is used in dosages of $50-200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ in the
treatment of hirsutism in women and appears to be as effective as finasteride, flutamide, or cyproterone in this condition.

\section*{Chemical Contraception in Men}

Although many studies have been conducted, an effective oral contraceptive for men has not yet been found. For example, various androgens, including testosterone and testosterone enanthate, in a dosage of 400 mg per month, produced azoospermia in less than half the men treated. Minor adverse reactions, including gynecomastia and acne, were encountered. Testosterone in combination with danazol was well tolerated but no more effective than testosterone alone. Androgens in combination with a progestin such as medroxyprogesterone acetate were no more effective. However, preliminary studies indicate that the intramuscular administration of 100 mg of testosterone enanthate weekly together with 500 mg of levonorgestrel daily orally can produce azoospermia in $94 \%$ of men.

Cyproterone acetate, a very potent progestin and antiandrogen, also produces oligospermia; however, it does not cause reliable contraception.

At present, pituitary hormones-and potent antagonist analogs of GnRH-are receiving increased attention. A GnRH antagonist in combination with testosterone has been shown to produce reversible azoospermia in nonhuman primates.

\section*{GOSSYPOL}

Extensive trials of this cottonseed derivative have been conducted in China. This compound destroys elements of the seminiferous epithelium but does not significantly alter the endocrine function of the testis.

In Chinese studies, large numbers of men were treated with $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ of gossypol or gossypol acetic acid for 2 months, followed by a maintenance dosage of $60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{wk}$. On this regimen, $99 \%$ of men developed sperm counts below 4 million $/ \mathrm{mL}$. Preliminary data indicate that recovery (return of normal sperm count) following discontinuance of gossypol administration is more apt to occur in men whose counts do not fall to extremely low levels and when administration is not continued for more than 2 years. Hypokalemia is the major adverse effect and may lead to transient paralysis. The drug has also been tried as an intravaginal spermicide contraceptive.

\section*{THE ENDOCRINE PANCREAS}

The endocrine pancreas in the adult human consists of approximately 1 million islets of Langerhans interspersed throughout the pancreatic gland. Within the islets, at least four hormone-producing cells are present (Table 41-1). Their hormone products include insulin, the storage and anabolic hormone of the body; islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP, or amylin), which modulates appetite, gastric emptying, and glucagon and insulin secretion; glucagon, the hyperglycemic factor that mobilizes glycogen stores; somatostatin, a universal inhibitor of secretory cells; and pancreatic peptide, a small protein that facilitates digestive processes by a mechanism not yet clarified.

The elevated blood glucose associated with diabetes mellitus results from absent or inadequate pancreatic insulin secretion, with or without concurrent impairment of insulin action. The disease states underlying the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus are now classified into four categories: type 1, insulin-dependent diabetes; type 2, noninsulin-dependent diabetes ; type 3, other; and type 4, gestational diabetes mellitus (Expert Committee, 2003).

\section*{Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus}

The hallmark of type 1 diabetes is selective B-cell destruction and severe or absolute insulin deficiency.

Administration of insulin is essential in patients with type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is further subdivided into immune and idiopathic causes. The immune form is the most common form of type 1 diabetes. Although most patients are younger than 30 years of age at the time of diagnosis, the onset can occur at any age. Type 1 diabetes is found in all ethnic groups, but the highest incidence is in people from northern Europe and from Sardinia. Susceptibility appears to involve a multifactorial genetic linkage but only 10-15\% of patients have a positive family history.

\section*{Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus}

Type 2 diabetes is characterized by tissue resistance to the action of insulin combined with a relative deficiency in insulin secretion. A given individual may have more resistance or more B-cell deficiency, and the abnormalities may be mild or severe. Although insulin is produced by the B cells in these patients, it is inadequate to overcome the resistance, and the blood glucose rises. The impaired insulin action also affects fat metabolism, resulting in increased free fatty acid flux and triglyceride levels and reciprocally low levels of highdensity lipoprotein (HDL).

Individuals with type 2 diabetes may not require insulin to survive, but $30 \%$ or more will benefit from insulin therapy to control the blood glucose. It is likely that $10-20 \%$ of individuals in whom type 2 diabetes was initially diagnosed actually have both type 1 and type 2 or a slowly progressing type 1, and ultimately will require full insulin replacement. Although persons with type 2 diabetes ordinarily do not develop ketosis, ketoacidosis may occur as the result of stress such as infection or use of medication that enhances resistance, eg, corticosteroids. Dehydration in untreated and poorly controlled individuals with type 2 diabetes can lead to a life-threatening condition called nonketotic hyperosmolar coma. In this condition, the blood glucose may rise to 6-20 times the normal range and an altered mental state develops or the person loses consciousness. Urgent medical care and rehydration is required.

\section*{Type 3 Diabetes Mellitus}

The type 3 designation refers to multiple other specific causes of an elevated blood glucose: nonpancreatic diseases, drug therapy, etc. For a detailed list the reader is referred to Expert Committee, 2003.

\section*{Type 4 Diabetes Mellitus}

Gestational diabetes (GDM) is defined as any abnormality in glucose levels noted for the first time during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed in approximately 4\% of all pregnancies in the USA. During pregnancy, the placenta and placental hormones create an insulin resistance that is most pronounced in the last trimester. Risk assessment for diabetes is suggested starting at the first prenatal visit. High-risk women should be screened immediately. Screening may be deferred in lower-risk women until the 24th to 28th week of gestation.

\section*{INSULIN}

\section*{Chemistry}

Insulin is a small protein with a molecular weight in humans of 5808 . It contains 51 amino acids arranged in two chains (A and B) linked by disulfide bridges; there are species differences in the amino acids of both chains. Proinsulin, a long single-chain protein molecule, is processed within the Golgi apparatus and packaged into granules, where it is hydrolyzed into insulin and a residual connecting segment called C-peptide by
removal of four amino acids (shown in dashed circles in Figure 41-1).
Figure 41-1.

(GIU) Insulin Glulisine
Structure of human proinsulin and some commercially available insulin analogs. Insulin is shown as the shaded (darker color) peptide chains, A and B. Differences in the A and B chains and amino acid modifications for insulin aspart, lispro, and glulisine are noted.

Insulin and C-peptide are secreted in equimolar amounts in response to all insulin secretagogues; a small quantity of unprocessed or partially hydrolyzed proinsulin is released as well. Although proinsulin may have some mild hypoglycemic action, C-peptide has no known physiologic function. Granules within the B cells store the insulin in the form of crystals consisting of two atoms of zinc and six molecules of insulin. The entire human pancreas contains up to 8 mg of insulin, representing approximately 200 biologic units. Originally, the unit was defined on the basis of the hypoglycemic activity of insulin in rabbits. With improved purification techniques, the unit is presently defined on the basis of weight, and present insulin standards used for assay purposes contain 28 units per milligram.

\section*{Insulin Secretion}

Insulin is released from pancreatic $B$ cells at a low basal rate and at a much higher stimulated rate in response to a variety of stimuli, especially glucose. Other stimulants such as other sugars (eg, mannose), certain amino acids (eg, leucine, arginine), hormones such as glucagon-like polypeptide-1 and vagal activity are recognized. One mechanism of stimulated insulin release is diagrammed in Figure 41-2. As shown in the figure, hyperglycemia results in increased intracellular ATP levels, which close the ATP-dependent potassium channels. Decreased outward potassium efflux results in depolarization of the B cell and opening of voltagegated calcium channels. The resulting increased intracellular calcium triggers secretion of the hormone. The insulin secretagogue drug group (sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and D -phenylalanine) exploits parts of this mechanism.
Figure 41-2.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-1259.jpg?height=928&width=1269&top_left_y=203&top_left_x=455)

One model of control of insulin release from the pancreatic B cell by glucose and by sulfonylurea drugs. In the resting cell with normal (low) ATP levels, potassium diffuses down its concentration gradient through ATP-gated potassium channels, maintaining the intracellular potential at a fully polarized, negative level. Insulin release is minimal. If glucose concentration rises, ATP production increases, potassium channels close, and depolarization of the cell results. As in muscle and nerve, voltage-gated calcium channels open in response to depolarization, allowing more calcium to enter the cell. Increased intracellular calcium results in increased insulin secretion. Insulin secretagogues close the ATP-dependent potassium channel, thereby depolarizing the membrane and causing increased insulin release by the same mechanism.

\section*{Insulin Degradation}

The liver and kidney are the two main organs that remove insulin from the circulation. The liver normally clears the blood of approximately $60 \%$ of the insulin released from the pancreas by virtue of its location as the terminal site of portal vein blood flow, with the kidney removing 35-40\% of the endogenous hormone. However, in insulin-treated diabetics receiving subcutaneous insulin injections, this ratio is reversed, with as much as $60 \%$ of exogenous insulin being cleared by the kidney and the liver removing no more than $30-40 \%$. The half-life of circulating insulin is $3-5$ minutes.

\section*{Circulating I nsulin}

Basal insulin values of $5-15 \mu \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{mL}$ ( $30-90 \mathrm{pmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) are found in normal humans, with a peak rise to 60-90 $\mu$. $\mathrm{U} / \mathrm{mL}$ (360-540 pmol/L) during meals.

\section*{The Insulin Receptor}

After insulin has entered the circulation, it diffuses into tissues, where it is bound by specialized receptors that are found on the membranes of most tissues. The biologic responses promoted by these insulin-receptor complexes have been identified in the primary target tissues, ie, liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. The
receptors bind insulin with high specificity and affinity in the picomolar range. The full insulin receptor consists of two covalently linked heterodimers, each containing an asubunit, which is entirely extracellular and constitutes the recognition site, and a Bsubunit that spans the membrane (Figure 41-3). The Bsubunit contains a tyrosine kinase. The binding of an insulin molecule to the asubunits at the outside surface of the cell activates the receptor and through a conformational change brings the catalytic loops of the opposing cytoplasmic Bsubunits into closer proximity. This facilitates mutual phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the Bsubunits and tyrosine kinase activity directed at cytoplasmic proteins.
Figure 41-3.

Schematic diagram of the insulin receptor heterodimer in the activated state. IRS, insulin receptor substrate; P, phosphate; tyr, tyrosine.

The first proteins to be phosphorylated by the activated receptor tyrosine kinases are the docking proteins,
insulin receptor substrate-1 through -6 (IRS-1 to IRS-6). After tyrosine phosphorylation at several critical sites, the IRS molecules bind to and activate other kinases-most significantly phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-which produce further phosphorylations or to an adaptor protein such as growth factor receptor-binding protein 2, which translates the insulin signal to a guanine nucleotide-releasing factor that ultimately activates the GTP binding protein ras, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) system. The particular IRSphosphorylated tyrosine kinases have binding specificity with downstream molecules based on their surrounding 4-5 amino acid sequences or motifs that recognize specific Src homology 2 (SH2) domains on the other protein. This network of phosphorylations within the cell represents insulin's second message and results in multiple effects, including translocation of glucose transporters (especially GLUT 4, Table 41-2) to the cell membrane with a resultant increase in glucose uptake; increased glycogen synthase activity and increased glycogen formation; multiple effects on protein synthesis, lipolysis, and lipogenesis; and activation of transcription factors that enhance DNA synthesis and cell growth and division. The IRS-2 signaling pathway is associated with cellular proliferation and mitogenesis.

Various hormonal agents (eg, glucocorticoids) lower the affinity of insulin receptors for insulin; growth hormone in excess increases this affinity slightly.

\section*{Effects of Insulin on Its Targets}

Insulin promotes the storage of fat as well as glucose (both sources of energy) within specialized target cells (Figure 41-4) and influences cell growth and the metabolic functions of a wide variety of tissues (Table 41-3). Figure 41-4.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-1262.jpg?height=898&width=906&top_left_y=868&top_left_x=631)

Insulin promotes synthesis (from circulating nutrients) and storage of glycogen, triglycerides, and protein in its major target tissues: liver, fat, and muscle. The release of insulin from the pancreas is stimulated by increased blood glucose, incretins, vagal nerve stimulation, and other factors (see text).

\section*{Characteristics of Available Insulin Preparations}

Commercial insulin preparations differ in a number of ways, such as differences in the recombinant DNA production techniques, amino acid sequence, concentration, solubility, and the time of onset and duration of their biologic action. In 2006, 17 insulin formulations were available in the USA.

\section*{PRINCIPAL TYPES AND DURATION OF ACTION OF INSULIN PREPARATIONS}

Four principal types of injected insulins are available: (1) rapid-acting, with very fast onset and short duration; (2) short-acting, with rapid onset of action; (3) intermediate-acting; and (4) long-acting, with slow onset of action (Figure 41-5, Table 41-4). An inhaled form of rapid-acting insulin also is marketed. Injected rapidacting and short-acting insulins are dispensed as clear solutions at neutral pH and contain small amounts of zinc to improve their stability and shelf-life. Inhaled rapid-acting human insulin is available as a powder for alveolar absorption. Injected intermediate-acting NPH insulins have been modified to provide prolonged action and are dispensed as a turbid suspension at neutral pH with protamine in phosphate buffer (neutral protamine Hagedorn [NPH] insulin). Insulin glargine and insulin detemir are the soluble long-acting insulins. The goal of subcutaneous insulin therapy is to replace the normal basal (overnight, fasting, and between meal) as well as bolus or prandial (mealtime) insulin. Current regimens generally use long-acting insulins to provide basal or background coverage, and rapid-acting insulin to meet the mealtime requirements. The latter insulins are given as supplemental doses to correct transient hyperglycemia. Intensive therapy ("tight control") attempts to restore near-normal glucose patterns throughout the day while minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia.

Figure 41-5.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-1264.jpg?height=787&width=1554&top_left_y=295&top_left_x=307)

Extent and duration of action of various types of insulin as indicated by the glucose infusion rates ( $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ ) required to maintain a constant glucose concentration. The durations of action shown are typical of an average dose of $0.2-0.3 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{kg}$; with the exception of insulin lispro, aspart, and glulisine, duration increases considerably when dosage is increased.

${ }^{1}$ All of these agents (except insulin lispro, insulin aspart, insulin detemir, insulin glulisine, inhaled insulin, and U500 regular Humulin) are available without a prescription. All insulins should be refrigerated and brought to room temperature just before injection.
${ }^{2}$ Velosulin contains phosphate buffer, which favors its use to prevent insulin aggregation in pump tubing but precludes its being mixed with lente insulin.

An exact reproduction of the normal glycemic profile is technically not possible because of the limitations inherent in subcutaneous administration of insulin. The most sophisticated insulin regimen delivers rapid-acting insulin through a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion device; alternative intensive regimens referred to as multiple daily injections (MDI) use long-acting insulins with multiple boluses of rapid-acting insulin. Conventional therapy presently consists of split-dose injections of mixtures of rapid- or short-acting and intermediate-acting insulins.

\section*{Rapid-Acting Insulin}

Three injected rapid-acting insulin analogs: insulin lispro, insulin aspart, and insulin glulisine, and one
inhaled form of rapid-acting insulin, human insulin recombinant inhaled, are commercially available. The rapid-acting insulins permit more physiologic prandial insulin replacement because their rapid onset and early peak action more closely mimic normal endogenous prandial insulin secretion than does regular insulin, and they have the additional benefit of allowing insulin to be taken immediately before the meal without sacrificing glucose control. Their duration of action is rarely more than 3-5 hours (with the exception of inhaled insulin, which may last 6-7 hours), which decreases the risk of late postmeal hypoglycemia. The injected rapid-acting insulins have the lowest variability of absorption (approximately $5 \%$ ) of all available commercial insulins (compared to $25 \%$ for regular insulin and $25-50 \%$ for intermediate- and long-acting formulations). They are the preferred insulins for use in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion devices.

Insulin lispro, the first monomeric insulin analog to be marketed, is produced by recombinant technology wherein two amino acids near the carboxyl terminal of the B chain have been reversed in position: Proline at position B28 has been moved to B29, and lysine at position B29 has been moved to B28 (Figure 41-1). Reversing these two amino acids does not interfere in any way with insulin lispro's binding to the insulin receptor, its circulating half-life, or its immunogenicity, which are similar to those of human regular insulin. However, the advantage of this analog is its very low propensity-in contrast to human insulin-to selfassociate in antiparallel fashion and form dimers. To enhance the shelf-life of insulin in vials, insulin lispro is stabilized into hexamers by a cresol preservative. When injected subcutaneously, the drug quickly dissociates into monomers and is rapidly absorbed with onset of action within 5-15 minutes and peak activity as early as 1 hour. The time to peak action is relatively constant, regardless of the dose.

Insulin aspart is created by the substitution of the B28 proline with a negatively charged aspartic acid (Figure 41-1). This modification reduces the normal ProB28 and GlyB23 monomer-monomer interaction, thereby inhibiting insulin self-aggregation. Its absorption and activity profile is similar to that of insulin lispro, and it is more reproducible than regular insulin, but has similar binding properties, activity, and mitogenicity characteristics to regular insulin and equivalent immunogenicity.

Insulin glulisine is formulated by substituting an asparagine for lysine at B3 and glutamic acid for lysine at B29. Its absorption, action, and immunologic characteristics are similar to the other injected rapid-acting insulins. After high-dose insulin glulisine-insulin receptor interaction, there may be downstream differences in IRS-2 pathway activation relative to human insulin. The clinical significance of such differences is unclear.

Inhaled human insulin is a powder form of rDNA human insulin that is administered through an inhaler device and is marketed for pre-prandial and blood sugar correction use in adults with type 1 and 2 diabetes. Because of concerns about lung safety, it is not approved for use in children, teenagers, or adults with asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, smokers, or those within 6 months of quitting smoking. Although this route of administration is well tolerated, studies have shown that less than $30 \%$ of users were able to achieve target blood glucoses after 6 months of therapy with inhaled human insulin.

\section*{Short-Acting Insulin}

Regular insulin is a short-acting soluble crystalline zinc insulin made by recombinant DNA techniques to produce a molecule identical to human insulin. Its effect appears within 30 minutes and peaks between 2 and 3 hours after subcutaneous injection and generally lasts $5-8$ hours. In high concentrations, eg, in the vial, regular insulin molecules self-aggregate in antiparallel fashion to form dimers that stabilize around zinc ions to create insulin hexamers. The hexameric nature of regular insulin causes a delayed onset and prolongs the time to peak action. After subcutaneous injection, the insulin hexamers are too large and bulky to be transported across the vascular endothelium into the bloodstream. As the insulin depot is diluted by interstitial fluid and
the concentration begins to fall, the hexamers break down into dimers and finally monomers. This results in three rates of absorption of the injected insulin, with the final monomeric phase having the fastest uptake out of the injection site. The delayed absorption results in a mismatching of insulin availability with need.

Specifically, when regular insulin is administered at mealtime, the blood glucose rises faster than the insulin with resultant early postprandial hyperglycemia and an increased risk of late postprandial hypoglycemia. Regular insulin should be injected 30-45 or more minutes before the meal to minimize the mismatching. As with all older insulin formulations, the duration of action as well as the time of onset and the intensity of peak action increase with the size of the dose. Clinically, this is a critical issue because the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of small doses of regular and NPH insulins differ greatly from those of large doses. Shortacting soluble insulin is the only type that should be administered intravenously because the dilution causes the hexameric insulin to immediately dissociate into monomers. It is particularly useful for intravenous therapy in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis and when the insulin requirement is changing rapidly, such as after surgery or during acute infections.

\section*{Intermediate-Acting and Long-Acting Insulins}

\section*{NPH (NEUTRAL PROTAMI NE HAGEDORN, OR ISOPHANE) I NSULI N}

NPH insulin is an intermediate-acting insulin wherein absorption and the onset of action are delayed by combining appropriate amounts of insulin and protamine so that neither is present in an uncomplexed form ("isophane"). Protamine is a mixture of six major and some minor compounds of similar structure isolated from the sperm of rainbow trout. They appear to be basic, arginine-rich peptides with an average molecular weight of approximately 4400. To form an isophane complex (one in which neither component retains any free binding sites), approximately a 1:10 ratio by weight of protamine to insulin is required, representing approximately six molecules of insulin per molecule of protamine. After subcutaneous injection, proteolytic tissue enzymes degrade the protamine to permit absorption of insulin. NPH insulin has an onset of approximately $2-5$ hours and duration of 4-12 hours (Figure 41-5); it is usually mixed with regular, lispro, aspart, or glulisine insulin and given two to four times daily for insulin replacement in patients with type 1 diabetes. The dose regulates the action profile; specifically, small doses have lower, earlier peaks and a short duration of action with the converse true for large doses.

\section*{I NSULI N GLARGI NE}

Insulin glargine is a soluble, "peakless" (ie, having a broad plasma concentration plateau), ultra-long-acting insulin analog. This product was designed to provide reproducible, convenient, background insulin replacement. The attachment of two arginine molecules to the B chain carboxyl terminal and substitution of a glycine for asparagine at the A21 position created an analog that is soluble in an acidic solution but precipitates in the more neutral body pH after subcutaneous injection. Individual insulin molecules slowly dissolve away from the crystalline depot and provide a low, continuous level of circulating insulin. Insulin glargine has a slow onset of action (1-1.5 hours) and achieves a maximum effect after 4-6 hours. This maximum activity is maintained for 11-24 hours or longer. Glargine is usually given once daily, although some very insulin-sensitive individuals benefit from split (twice a day) dosing. To maintain solubility, the formulation is unusually acidic (pH 4.0) and insulin glargine should not be mixed with other insulins. Separate syringes must be used to minimize the risk of contamination and subsequent loss of efficacy. The absorption pattern of insulin glargine appears to be independent of the anatomic site of injection, and this drug is associated with less immunogenicity than human insulin in animal studies. Glargine's interaction with the insulin receptor is similar to that of native insulin and shows no increase in mitogenic activity in vitro. It has sixfold to sevenfold greater binding than native insulin to the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor, but the clinical
significance of this is unclear.

\section*{I NSULI N DETEMI R}

This insulin is the most recently developed long-acting insulin analog. The terminal threonine is dropped from the B30 position and myristic acid (a C-14 fatty acid chain) is attached to the terminal B29 lysine. These modifications prolong the availability of the injected analog by increasing both self-aggregation in subcutaneous tissue and reversible albumin binding. Insulin detemir has the most reproducible effect of the intermediate- and long-acting insulins, and its use is associated with less hypoglycemia than NPH insulin. Insulin detemir has a dose-dependent onset of action of 1-2 hours and duration of action of more than 24 hours. It is given twice daily to obtain a smooth background insulin level.

\section*{Mixtures of Insulins}

Because intermediate-acting NPH insulins require several hours to reach adequate therapeutic levels, their use in type 1 diabetic patients requires supplements of rapid- or short-acting insulin before meals. For convenience, these are often mixed together in the same syringe before injection. Insulin lispro, aspart, and glulisine can be acutely mixed (ie, just before injection) with NPH insulin without affecting their rapid absorption. However, premixed preparations have thus far been unstable. To remedy this, intermediate insulins composed of isophane complexes of protamine with insulin lispro and insulin aspart have been developed. These intermediate insulins have been designated as "NPL" (neutral protamine lispro) and "NPA" (neutral protamine aspart) and have the same duration of action as NPH insulin. They have the advantage of permitting formulation as premixed combinations of NPL and insulin lispro, and as NPA and insulin aspart, and they have been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials. The FDA has approved $50 \% / 50 \%$ and $75 \% / 25 \% \mathrm{NPL} /$ insulin lispro and $70 \% / 30 \% \mathrm{NPA} /$ insulin aspart premixed formulations. Additional ratios are available abroad. Insulin glargine and detemir must be given as separate injections. They are not miscible acutely or in a premixed preparation with any other insulin formulation.

\section*{INSULIN PRODUCTION}

\section*{Human Insulins}

Mass production of human insulin and insulin analogs by recombinant DNA techniques is carried out by inserting the human or a modified proinsulin gene into Escherichia coli or yeast and treating the extracted proinsulin to form the insulin or insulin analog molecules.

\section*{CONCENTRATION}

All insulins in the USA and Canada are currently available in a concentration of $100 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{mL}$ (U100). A limited supply of U500 regular human insulin is available for use in rare cases of severe insulin resistance in which larger doses of insulin are required.

\section*{Insulin Delivery Systems}

The standard mode of insulin therapy is subcutaneous injection using conventional disposable needles and syringes. During the last three decades, much effort has gone into exploration of other means of administration, and inhaled insulin is now available.

\section*{PORTABLE PEN INJ ECTORS}

To facilitate multiple subcutaneous injections of insulin, particularly during intensive insulin therapy, portable pen-sized injectors have been developed. These contain cartridges of insulin and replaceable needles. Disposable insulin pens are also available for selected formulations. These are regular insulin, insulin lispro, insulin aspart, insulin glulisine, insulin glargine, insulin detemir, and several mixtures of NPH with regular,
lispro, or aspart insulin (Table 41-4). They have been well accepted by patients because they eliminate the need to carry syringes and bottles of insulin to the workplace and while traveling.

\section*{CONTINUOUS SUBCUTANEOUS INSULIN INFUSION DEVICES (CSII, INSULIN PUMPS)}

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion devices are external open-loop pumps for insulin delivery. The devices have a user-programmable pump that delivers individualized basal and bolus insulin replacement doses based on blood glucose self-monitoring results. Normally, the 24 -hour background basal rates are relatively constant from day to day, although temporarily altered rates can be superimposed to adjust for a short-term change in requirement. For example, the basal delivery rate might need to be decreased for several hours because of the increased insulin sensitivity associated with strenuous activity. In contrast, the bolus amounts frequently vary and are used to correct high blood glucose levels and to cover mealtime insulin requirements based on the carbohydrate content of the food and concurrent activity. The pump-which contains an insulin reservoir, the program chip, the keypad, and the display screen-is about the size of a pager. It is usually placed on a belt or in a pocket, and the insulin is infused through thin plastic tubing that is connected to the subcutaneously inserted infusion set. The abdomen is the favored site for the infusion set, although flanks and thighs are also used. The insulin reservoir, tubing, and infusion set need to be changed using sterile techniques every 2 or 3 days. CSII delivery is regarded as the most physiologic method of insulin replacement.

The use of these continuous infusion devices is encouraged for individuals who are unable to obtain target control while on multiple injection regimens and in circumstances in which excellent glycemic control is desired, such as during pregnancy. Their optimal use requires responsible involvement and commitment by the patient. Velosulin (a regular insulin) and insulin aspart, lispro, and glulisine are all specifically approved for pump use. Insulins aspart, lispro, and glulisine are preferred pump insulins because their favorable pharmacokinetic attributes allow glycemic control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.

\section*{INHALED INSULIN}

The FDA has approved an inhaled insulin preparation of finely powdered and aerosolized human insulin. Insulin is readily absorbed into the bloodstream through alveolar walls, but the challenge has been to create particles that are small enough to pass through the bronchial tree without being trapped and still enter the alveoli in sufficient amounts to have a clinical effect. Insulin delivered by the inhaled route has pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of both rapid- and short-acting insulin. It has a rapid onset and peak insulin levels (by 30 minutes) similar to insulin lispro, aspart, and glulisine, and peak effect ( $2-2.5$ hours) and duration of action (6-8 hours) similar to regular insulin. Inhaled insulin can be used to cover mealtime insulin requirements or to correct high glucose levels, but not to provide background or basal insulin coverage. Less than $10 \%$ of the inhaled insulin dose (which ranges from 1 mg to 6 mg ) is absorbed. One milligram of inhaled insulin is equivalent to 2-3 units of regular human insulin injected subcutaneously. Safety concerns include possible pulmonary fibrosis or hypertension, reduced lung volume or oxygen diffusing capacity, and excessive insulin antibody formation.

\section*{Treatment with Insulin}

The current classification of diabetes mellitus identifies a group of patients who have virtually no insulin secretion and whose survival depends on administration of exogenous insulin. This insulin-dependent group (type 1) represents $5-10 \%$ of the diabetic population in the USA. Most type 2 diabetics do not require exogenous insulin for survival, but many need exogenous supplementation of their endogenous secretion to achieve optimum health.

\section*{Benefit of Glycemic Control in Diabetes Mellitus}

The consensus of the American Diabetes Association is that intensive glycemic control associated with comprehensive self-management training should become standard therapy in type 1 patients (see Benefits of Tight Glycemic Control in Diabetes). Exceptions include patients with advanced renal disease and the elderly, since the risks of hypoglycemia outweigh the benefit of tight glycemic control in these groups. In children under the age of 7 years, the extreme susceptibility of the developing brain to damage from hypoglycemia contraindicates attempts at intensive glycemic control. A similar conclusion regarding the benefits of tight control in type 2 diabetes was reached as the result of a large study in the United Kingdom.

\section*{BENEFITS OF TIGHT GLYCEMIC CONTROL IN DIABETES}

A long-term randomized prospective study involving 1441 type 1 patients in 29 medical centers reported in 1993 that "near normalization" of blood glucose resulted in a delay in onset and a major slowing of progression of microvascular and neuropathic complications of diabetes during follow-up periods of up to 10 years (Diabetes Control And Complications Trial [DCCT] Research Group, 1993). In the intensively treated group, a mean glycated hemoglobin $\mathrm{HbA}_{1 \mathrm{c}}$ of $7.2 \%$ (normal $<6 \%$ ) and a mean blood glucose of $155 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ were achieved, whereas in the conventionally treated group, $\mathrm{HbA}_{1 \mathrm{c}}$ averaged $8.9 \%$ with an average blood glucose of $225 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Over the study period, which averaged 7 years, approximately a $60 \%$ reduction in risk of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy was noted in the tight control group compared with the standard control group.

The DCCT study, in addition, has introduced the concept of glycemic memory, which comprises the long-term benefits of any significant period of glycemic control. During a 6-year follow-up period, both the intensively and the conventionally treated groups had similar levels of glycemic control, and both had progression of carotid intimal-medial thickness. However, the intensively treated cohort had significantly less progression of intimal thickness.

The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) was a very large randomized prospective study carried out to study the effects of intensive glycemic control with several types of therapies and the effects of blood pressure control in type 2 diabetic patients. A total of 3867 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients were studied over 10 years. A significant fraction of these were overweight and hypertensive. Patients were given dietary treatment alone or intensive therapy with insulin, chlorpropamide, glyburide, or glipizide. Metformin was an option for patients with inadequate response to other therapies. Tight control of blood pressure was added as a variable, with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, B-blocker or, in some cases, a calcium channel blocker available for this purpose.

Tight control of diabetes, with reduction of $\mathrm{HbA}_{1 \mathrm{c}}$ from $9.1 \%$ to $7 \%$, was shown to reduce the risk of microvascular complications overall compared with that achieved with conventional therapy (mostly diet alone, which decreased $\mathrm{HbA}_{1 \mathrm{c}}$ to $7.9 \%$ ). Cardiovascular complications were not noted for any particular therapy; metformin treatment alone reduced the risk of macrovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke).

Tight control of hypertension also had a surprisingly significant effect on microvascular disease (as well as more conventional hypertension-related sequelae) in these diabetic patients. These studies show that tight glycemic control benefits both type 1 and type 2 patients.

The STOP-NIDDM trial followed up 1429 patients with impaired glucose tolerance who were randomized to treatment with acarbose or placebo over 3 years. This trial demonstrated that normalization of glycemic control in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance significantly diminished cardiovascular risk. The acarbose-
treated group had a significant reduction in the development of major cardiovascular events and hypertension. A prospective placebo-controlled subgroup analysis has shown a marked decrease in the progression of intimal-medial thickness.

\section*{Complications of Insulin Therapy}

\section*{HYPOGLYCEMI A}

\section*{Mechanisms and Diagnosis}

Hypoglycemic reactions are the most common complication of insulin therapy. They may result from a delay in taking a meal, inadequate carbohydrate consumed, unusual physical exertion, or a dose of insulin that is too large for immediate needs.

Rapid development of hypoglycemia in individuals with intact hypoglycemic awareness causes signs of autonomic hyperactivity, both sympathetic (tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, tremulousness) and parasympathetic (nausea, hunger) and may progress to convulsions and coma if untreated.

In individuals exposed to frequent hypoglycemic episodes during tight glycemic control, autonomic warning signals of hypoglycemia are less common or even absent. This dangerous acquired condition is termed "hypoglycemic unawareness." When patients lack the early warning signs of low blood glucose, they may not take corrective measures in time. In patients with persistent, untreated hypoglycemia, the manifestations of insulin excess may develop-confusion, weakness, bizarre behavior, coma, seizures-at which point they may not be able to procure or safely swallow glucose-containing foods. Hypoglycemic awareness may be restored by preventing frequent hypoglycemic episodes. An identification bracelet, necklace, or card in the wallet or purse, as well as some form of rapidly absorbed glucose, should be carried by every diabetic who is receiving hypoglycemic drug therapy.

\section*{Treatment of Hypoglycemia}

All the manifestations of hypoglycemia are relieved by glucose administration. To expedite absorption, simple sugar or glucose should be given, preferably in a liquid form. To treat mild hypoglycemia in a patient who is conscious and able to swallow, dextrose tablets, glucose gel, or any sugar-containing beverage or food may be given. If more severe hypoglycemia has produced unconsciousness or stupor, the treatment of choice is to give $20-50 \mathrm{~mL}$ of $50 \%$ glucose solution by intravenous infusion over a period of $2-3$ minutes. If intravenous therapy is not available, 1 mg of glucagon injected either subcutaneously or intramuscularly usually restores consciousness within 15 minutes to permit ingestion of sugar. If the patient is stuporous and glucagon is not available, small amounts of honey or syrup can be inserted into the buccal pouch. In general, however, oral feeding is contraindicated in unconscious patients. Emergency medical services should be called for all episodes of severely impaired consciousness.

\section*{I MMUNOPATHOLOGY OF INSULI N THERAPY}

At least five molecular classes of insulin antibodies may be produced in diabetics during the course of insulin therapy: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. There are two major types of immune disorders in these patients:

\section*{Insulin Allergy}

Insulin allergy, an immediate type hypersensitivity, is a rare condition in which local or systemic urticaria results from histamine release from tissue mast cells sensitized by anti-insulin IgE antibodies. In severe cases, anaphylaxis results. Because sensitivity is often to noninsulin protein contaminants, the human and analog insulins have markedly reduced the incidence of insulin allergy, especially local reactions.

A low titer of circulating IgG anti-insulin antibodies that neutralize the action of insulin to a negligible extent develops in most insulin-treated patients. Rarely, the titer of insulin antibodies leads to insulin resistance and may be associated with other systemic autoimmune processes such as lupus erythematosus.

\section*{LI PODYSTROPHY AT INJ ECTION SITES}

Injection of older animal insulin preparations sometimes led to atrophy of subcutaneous fatty tissue at the site of injection. This type of immune complication is almost never seen since the development of human and analog insulin preparations of neutral pH. Injection of these newer preparations directly into the atrophic area often results in restoration of normal contours. Hypertrophy of subcutaneous fatty tissue remains a problem if injected repeatedly at the same site. However, this may be corrected by avoidance of that specific injection site or with liposuction.

\section*{ORAL ANTI DI ABETI C AGENTS}

Four categories of oral antidiabetic agents are now available in the USA: insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas, meglitinides, D -phenylalanine derivatives), biguanides, thiazolidinediones, and aglucosidase inhibitors. The sulfonylureas and biguanides have been available the longest and are the traditional initial treatment choice for type 2 diabetes. Novel classes of rapidly acting insulin secretagogues, the meglitinides and D -phenylalanine derivatives, are alternatives to the short-acting sulfonylurea, tolbutamide. The thiazolidinediones, under development since the early 1980s, are very effective agents that reduce insulin resistance. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors have a relatively weak antidiabetic effect and significant adverse effects, and they are used primarily as adjunctive therapy in individuals who cannot achieve their glycemic goals with other medications.

\section*{I NSULI N SECRETAGOGUES: SULFONYLUREAS}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

The major action of sulfonylureas is to increase insulin release from the pancreas (Table 41-5). Two additional mechanisms of action have been proposed-a reduction of serum glucagon levels and closure of potassium channels in extrapancreatic tissues.

\section*{INSULIN RELEASE FROM PANCREATIC B CELLS}

Sulfonylureas bind to a 140-kDa high-affinity sulfonylurea receptor (Figure 41-2) that is associated with a Bcell inward rectifier ATP-sensitive potassium channel. Binding of a sulfonylurea inhibits the efflux of potassium ions through the channel and results in depolarization. Depolarization opens a voltage-gated calcium channel and results in calcium influx and the release of preformed insulin.

\section*{REDUCTION OF SERUM GLUCAGON CONCENTRATIONS}

Long-term administration of sulfonylureas to type 2 diabetics reduces serum glucagon levels, which may contribute to the hypoglycemic effect of the drugs. The mechanism for this suppressive effect of sulfonylureas on glucagon levels is unclear but appears to involve indirect inhibition due to enhanced release of both insulin and somatostatin, which inhibit A-cell secretion.

\section*{POTASSIUM CHANNEL CLOSURE IN EXTRAPANCREATIC TISSUES}

Insulin secretagogues bind to sulfonylurea receptors in potassium channels in extrapancreatic tissues, but the binding affinity varies among the drug classes and is much less avid than for the B-cell receptors. The clinical significance of extrapancreatic binding is not known.

\section*{Efficacy \& Safety of the Sulfonylureas}

In 1970, the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP) in the USA reported that the number of deaths due to cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients treated with tolbutamide was excessive compared with either insulin-treated patients or those receiving placebos. Owing to design flaws, this study and its conclusions were not generally accepted. A study in the United Kingdom, the UKPDS, did not find an untoward cardiovascular effect of sulfonylurea usage in their large, long-term study.

The sulfonylureas continue to be widely prescribed, and six are available in the USA (Table 41-6). They are conventionally divided into first-generation and second-generation agents, which differ primarily in their
potency and adverse effects. The first-generation sulfonylureas are increasingly difficult to procure, and as the second-generation agents become generic and less expensive, the older compounds probably will be discontinued.

${ }^{1}$ Outside USA.
${ }^{2}$ Elimination half-life considerably shorter (see text).

\section*{First-Generation Sulfonylureas}

Tolbutamide is well absorbed but rapidly metabolized in the liver. Its duration of effect is relatively short, with an elimination half-life of 4-5 hours, and it is best administered in divided doses. Because of its short half-life, it is the safest sulfonylurea for elderly diabetics. Prolonged hypoglycemia has been reported rarely, mostly in
patients receiving certain drugs (eg, dicumarol, phenylbutazone, some sulfonamides) that inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide.

Chlorpropamide has a half-life of 32 hours and is slowly metabolized in the liver to products that retain some biologic activity; approximately $20-30 \%$ is excreted unchanged in the urine. Chlorpropamide also interacts with the drugs mentioned above that depend on hepatic oxidative catabolism, and it is contraindicated in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency. Dosages higher than 500 mg daily increase the risk of jaundice. The average maintenance dosage is 250 mg daily, given as a single dose in the morning. Prolonged hypoglycemic reactions are more common in elderly patients, and the drug is contraindicated in this group. Other side effects include a hyperemic flush after alcohol ingestion in genetically predisposed patients and dilutional hyponatremia. Hematologic toxicity (transient leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) occurs in less than $1 \%$ of patients.

Tolazamide is comparable to chlorpropamide in potency but has a shorter duration of action. Tolazamide is more slowly absorbed than the other sulfonylureas, and its effect on blood glucose does not appear for several hours. Its half-life is about 7 hours. Tolazamide is metabolized to several compounds that retain hypoglycemic effects. If more than $500 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ are required, the dose should be divided and given twice daily.

\section*{Second-Generation Sulfonylureas}

The second-generation sulfonylureas are more frequently prescribed in the USA than the first-generation agents because they have fewer adverse effects and drug interactions. These potent sulfonylurea compounds—glyburide, glipizide, and glimepiride—should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease or in elderly patients, in whom hypoglycemia would be especially dangerous.

Glyburide is metabolized in the liver into products with very low hypoglycemic activity. The usual starting dosage is $2.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ or less, and the average maintenance dosage is $5-10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ given as a single morning dose; maintenance dosages higher than $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ are not recommended. A formulation of "micronized" glyburide (Glynase PresTab) is available in a variety of tablet sizes. However, there is some question as to its bioequivalence with nonmicronized formulations, and the FDA recommends careful monitoring to retitrate dosage when switching from standard glyburide doses or from other sulfonylurea drugs.

Glyburide has few adverse effects other than its potential for causing hypoglycemia. Flushing has rarely been reported after ethanol ingestion, and the compound slightly enhances free water clearance. Glyburide is contraindicated in the presence of hepatic impairment and in patients with renal insufficiency.

Glipizide has the shortest half-life (2-4 hours) of the more potent agents. For maximum effect in reducing postprandial hyperglycemia, this agent should be ingested 30 minutes before breakfast, because absorption is delayed when the drug is taken with food. The recommended starting dosage is $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, with up to $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ given as a single dose. When higher daily dosages are required, they should be divided and given before meals. The maximum total daily dosage recommended by the manufacturer is $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, although some studies indicate that the maximum therapeutic effect is achieved by $15-20 \mathrm{mg}$ of the drug. An extendedrelease preparation (Glucotrol XL) provides 24-hour action after a once-daily morning dose (maximum of 20 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ). However, this formulation appears to have sacrificed its lower propensity for severe hypoglycemia compared with longer-acting glyburide without showing any demonstrable therapeutic advantages over the latter (which can be obtained as a generic drug).

Because of its shorter half-life, the regular formulation of glipizide is much less likely than glyburide to produce
serious hypoglycemia. At least $90 \%$ of glipizide is metabolized in the liver to inactive products, and $10 \%$ is excreted unchanged in the urine. Glipizide therapy is therefore contraindicated in patients with significant hepatic or renal impairment, who would be at high risk for hypoglycemia.

Glimepiride is approved for once-daily use as monotherapy or in combination with insulin. Glimepiride achieves blood glucose lowering with the lowest dose of any sulfonylurea compound. A single daily dose of 1 mg has been shown to be effective, and the recommended maximal daily dose is 8 mg . It has a long duration of effect with a half-life of 5 hours, allowing once-daily dosing and thereby improving compliance. It is completely metabolized by the liver to inactive products.

\section*{Secondary Failure \& Tachyphylaxis to Sulfonylureas}

Secondary failure, ie, failure to maintain a good response to sulfonylurea therapy over the long term, remains a disconcerting problem in the management of type 2 diabetes. A progressive decrease in B-cell mass, reduction in physical activity, decline in lean body mass, or increase in ectopic fat deposition in chronic type 2 diabetes also may contribute to secondary failure.

\section*{I NSULI N SECRETAGOGUES: MEGLI TI NI DES}

The meglitinides are a relatively new class of insulin secretagogues. Repaglinide, the first member of the group, was approved for clinical use in 1998 (Table 41-7). These drugs modulate B-cell insulin release by regulating potassium efflux through the potassium channels previously discussed. There is overlap with the sulfonylureas in their molecular sites of action because the meglitinides have two binding sites in common with the sulfonylureas and one unique binding site.

Repaglinide has a very fast onset of action, with a peak concentration and peak effect within approximately 1 hour after ingestion, but the duration of action is $5-8$ hours. It is hepatically cleared by CYP3A4 with a plasma half-life of 1 hour. Because of its rapid onset, repaglinide is indicated for use in controlling postprandial glucose excursions. The drug should be taken just before each meal in doses of $0.25-4 \mathrm{mg}$ (maximum, $16 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ); hypoglycemia is a risk if the meal is delayed or skipped or contains inadequate carbohydrate. This drug should be used cautiously in individuals with renal and hepatic impairment. Repaglinide is approved as monotherapy or in combination with biguanides. There is no sulfur in its structure, so repaglinide may be used in type 2 diabetic individuals with sulfur or sulfonylurea allergy.

\section*{I NSULI N SECRETAGOGUE: D -PHENYLALANI NE DERI VATI VE}

Nateglinide, a D -phenylalanine derivative, is the latest insulin secretagogue to become clinically available. Nateglinide stimulates very rapid and transient release of insulin from B cells through closure of the ATPsensitive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel. It also partially restores initial insulin release in response to an intravenous glucose tolerance test. This may be a significant advantage of the drug because type 2 diabetes is associated with loss of this initial insulin response. The restoration of more normal insulin secretion may suppress glucagon release early in the meal and result in less endogenous or hepatic glucose production. Nateglinide may have a special role in the treatment of individuals with isolated postprandial hyperglycemia, but it has minimal effect on overnight or fasting glucose levels. Nateglinide is efficacious when given alone or in combination with nonsecretagogue oral agents (such as metformin). In contrast to other insulin secretagogues, dose titration is not required.

Nateglinide is ingested just before meals. It is absorbed within 20 minutes after oral administration with a time to peak concentration of less than 1 hour and is hepatically metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 with a half-life of 1.5 hours. The overall duration of action is less than 4 hours.

Nateglinide amplifies the insulin secretory response to a glucose load but has a markedly diminished effect in the presence of normoglycemia. The incidence of hypoglycemia may be the lowest of all the secretagogues,
and it has the advantage of being safe in individuals with very reduced renal function.

\section*{BI GUANI DES}

The structure of metformin is shown below. Phenformin (an older biguanide) was discontinued in the USA because of its association with lactic acidosis and because there was no documentation of any long-term benefit from its use.

Metformin

\section*{Mechanisms of Action}

A full explanation of the biguanides' mechanism of action remains elusive. Their blood glucose-lowering action does not depend on functioning pancreatic B cells. Patients with type 2 diabetes have considerably less fasting hyperglycemia as well as lower postprandial hyperglycemia after biguanides; however, hypoglycemia during biguanide therapy is essentially unknown. These agents are therefore more appropriately termed "euglycemic" agents. Currently proposed mechanisms of action include (1) reduced hepatic and renal gluconeogenesis; (2) slowing of glucose absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, with increased glucose to lactate conversion by enterocytes; (3) direct stimulation of glycolysis in tissues, with increased glucose removal from blood; and (4) reduction of plasma glucagon levels.

\section*{Metabolism \& Excretion}

Metformin has a half-life of 1.5-3 hours, is not bound to plasma proteins, is not metabolized, and is excreted by the kidneys as the active compound. As a consequence of metformin's blockade of gluconeogenesis, the drug may impair the hepatic metabolism of lactic acid. In patients with renal insufficiency, biguanides accumulate and thereby increase the risk of lactic acidosis, which appears to be a dose-related complication.

\section*{Clinical Use}

Biguanides have been most often prescribed for patients whose hyperglycemia is due to ineffective insulin action, ie, insulin resistance syndrome. Because metformin is an insulin-sparing agent and does not increase weight or provoke hypoglycemia, it offers obvious advantages over insulin or sulfonylureas in treating hyperglycemia in such individuals. The UKPDS reported that metformin therapy decreases the risk of macrovascular as well as microvascular disease; this is in contrast to the other therapies, which only modified microvascular morbidity. Biguanides are also indicated for use in combination with insulin secretagogues or thiazolidinediones in type 2 diabetics in whom oral monotherapy is inadequate. Metformin is useful in the prevention of type 2 diabetes; the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program concluded that metformin is efficacious in preventing the new onset of type 2 diabetes in middle-aged, obese persons with impaired glucose tolerance and fasting hyperglycemia. It is interesting that metformin did not prevent diabetes in older, leaner prediabetics.

The dosage of metformin is from 500 mg to a maximum of 2.55 g daily, with the lowest effective dose being recommended. A common schedule would be to begin with a single $500-\mathrm{mg}$ tablet given with breakfast for several days. If this is tolerated without gastrointestinal discomfort and if hyperglycemia persists, a second 500-mg tablet may be added with the evening meal. If further dose increases are required after 1 week, an
additional $500-\mathrm{mg}$ tablet can be added to be taken with the midday meal, or the larger ( $850-\mathrm{mg}$ ) tablet can be prescribed twice daily or even three times daily (the maximum recommended dosage) if needed. Dosage should always be divided because ingestion of more than 1000 mg at any one time usually provokes significant gastrointestinal side effects.

\section*{Toxicities}

The most common toxic effects of metformin are gastrointestinal (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea) and occur in up to $20 \%$ of patients. They are dose-related, tend to occur at the onset of therapy, and are often transient. However, metformin may have to be discontinued in $3-5 \%$ of patients because of persistent diarrhea. Absorption of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ appears to be reduced during long-term metformin therapy, and annual screening of serum vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ levels and red blood cell parameters has been encouraged by the manufacturer to determine the need for vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ injections. In the absence of hypoxia or renal or hepatic insufficiency, lactic acidosis is less common with metformin therapy than with phenformin therapy.

Biguanides are contraindicated in patients with renal disease, alcoholism, hepatic disease, or conditions predisposing to tissue anoxia (eg, chronic cardiopulmonary dysfunction), because of an increased risk of lactic acidosis induced by biguanide drugs in the presence of these diseases.

\section*{THI AZOLI DI NEDI ONES}

Thiazolidinediones (Tzds) act to decrease insulin resistance. Their primary action is the regulation of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation. Tzds are ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR- $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ ), part of the steroid and thyroid superfamily of nuclear receptors. These PPAR receptors are found in muscle, fat, and liver. PPAR- $\gamma$ receptors are complex and modulate the expression of the genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism, insulin signal transduction, and adipocyte and other tissue differentiation. The available Tzds do not have identical clinical effects, and new drug development will focus on defining PPAR effects and designing ligands that have selective action-much like the selective estrogen receptor modulators (see Chapter 40).

In addition to targeting adipocytes, myocytes, and hepatocytes, Tzds also have significant effects on vascular endothelium, the immune system, the ovaries, and tumor cells. Some of these responses may be independent of the PPAR- $\gamma$ pathway.

In persons with diabetes, a major site of Tzd action is adipose tissue, where the drug promotes glucose uptake and utilization and modulates synthesis of lipid hormones or cytokines and other proteins involved in energy regulation. Tzds also regulate adipocyte apoptosis and differentiation. Numerous other effects have been documented in animal studies but applicability to human tissues has yet to be determined.

Two thiazolidinediones are currently available: pioglitazone and rosiglitazone (Table 41-8). Their distinct side chains create differences in therapeutic action, metabolism, metabolite profile, and adverse effects. A third compound, troglitazone, was withdrawn from the market because of hepatic toxicity thought to be related to its side chain. Pioglitazone has PPAR- as well as PPAR- $\gamma$ activity. It is absorbed within 2 hours of ingestion; although food may delay uptake, total bioavailability is not affected. Pioglitazone is metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 to active metabolites. The bioavailability of numerous other drugs also degraded by these enzymes may be affected by pioglitazone therapy, including estrogen-containing oral contraceptives; additional methods of contraception are advised. Pioglitazone may be taken once daily; the usual starting dose is $15-30 \mathrm{mg}$. The triglyceride lowering effect is more significant than that observed with rosiglitazone,
presumably because of its PPAR- binding characteristics. Pioglitaxone therapy reduces mortality and macrovascular events (myocardial infarction and stroke). Pioglitazone is approved as a monotherapy and in combination with metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
Table 41-8. Thiazolidinediones.

Rosiglitazone is rapidly absorbed and highly protein-bound. It is metabolized in the liver to minimally active metabolites, predominantly by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9. It is administered once or twice daily; $4-8 \mathrm{mg}$ is the usual total dose. Rosiglitazone shares the common Tzd adverse effects but does not seem to have any significant drug interactions. The drug is approved for use in type 2 diabetes as monotherapy or in combination with a biguanide, sulfonylurea, in combination with a biguanide and sulfonylurea, and insulin.

Tzds are considered "euglycemics" and are efficacious in about 70\% of new users. The overall response is similar to sulfonylurea and biguanide monotherapy. Individuals experiencing secondary failure to other oral agents should benefit from the addition (rather than substitution) of a Tzd. Because their mechanism of action involves gene regulation, the Tzds have a slow onset and offset of activity over weeks or even months. Combination therapy with sulfonylureas and insulin can lead to hypoglycemia and may require dosage adjustment. Long-term therapy is associated with a drop in triglyceride levels and a slight rise in HDL and lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol values. An adverse effect common to both Tzds is fluid retention, which presents as a mild anemia and peripheral edema, especially when used in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues. Some reports have suggested an increased risk of heart failure. Rarely, new or worsening macular edema has been reported in association with rosiglitazone treatment. Many users have a dose-related
weight gain (average 1-3 kg), which may be fluid-related. These agents should not be used during pregnancy or in the presence of significant liver disease (ALT more than $2.5 \times$ upper limit of normal), or if there is a concurrent diagnosis of heart failure. Anovulatory women may resume ovulation and should be counseled on the increased risk of pregnancy. Because of the hepatotoxicity observed with troglitazone, a discontinued Tzd, the FDA continues to require monitoring of liver function tests before initiation of Tzd therapy and periodically afterward. To date, hepatotoxicity has not been associated with rosiglitazone or pioglitazone.

Thiazolidinediones have an emerging benefit in the prevention of type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Trial reported a 75\% reduction in the diabetes incidence rate when troglitazone was administered to patients with prediabetes. Another study reported that troglitazone therapy significantly decreased the recurrence of diabetes mellitus in high-risk Hispanic women with a history of gestational diabetes. Other trials using clinically available Tzds are in progress.

\section*{ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITORS}

Only monosaccharides, such as glucose and fructose, can be transported out of the intestinal lumen and into the bloodstream. Complex starches, oligosaccharides, and disaccharides must be broken down into individual monosaccharides before being absorbed in the duodenum and upper jejunum. This digestion is facilitated by enteric enzymes, including pancreatic a-amylase, and a-glucosidases that are attached to the brush border of the intestinal cells. Acarbose and miglitol are competitive inhibitors of the intestinal a.glucosidases and reduce the postprandial digestion and absorption of starch and disaccharides (Table 41-9). Miglitol differs structurally from acarbose and is six times more potent in inhibiting sucrase. Although the binding affinity of the two compounds differs, acarbose and miglitol both target the a-glucosidases: sucrase, maltase, glycoamylase, and dextranase. Miglitol alone has effects on isomaltase and on B-glucosidases, which split Blinked sugars such as lactose. Acarbose alone has a small effect on a-amylase. The consequence of enzyme inhibition is to minimize upper intestinal digestion and defer digestion (and thus absorption) of the ingested starch and disaccharides to the distal small intestine, thereby lowering postmeal glycemic excursions as much as $45-60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ and creating an insulin-sparing effect. Monotherapy with these drugs is associated with a modest drop ( $0.5-1 \%$ ) in glycohemoglobin levels and a $20-25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ fall in fasting glucose levels. They are FDA-approved for persons with type 2 diabetes as monotherapy and in combination with sulfonylureas, in which the glycemic effect is additive. Both acarbose and miglitol are taken in doses of $25-100 \mathrm{mg}$ just before ingesting the first portion of each meal; therapy should be initiated with the lowest dose and slowly titrated upward.

Prominent adverse effects include flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal pain and result from the appearance of undigested carbohydrate in the colon that is then fermented into short-chain fatty acids, releasing gas. These side effects tend to diminish with ongoing use because chronic exposure to carbohydrate induces the expression of a.glucosidase in the jejunum and ileum, increasing distal small intestine glucose absorption and minimizing the passage of carbohydrate into the colon. Although not a problem with monotherapy or combination therapy with a biguanide, hypoglycemia may occur with concurrent sulfonylurea treatment. Hypoglycemia should be treated with glucose (dextrose) and not sucrose, whose breakdown may be blocked. These drugs are contraindicated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or any intestinal condition that could be worsened by gas and distention. Because both miglitol and acarbose are excreted by the kidneys, these medications should not be prescribed in individuals with renal impairment. Acarbose has been associated with reversible hepatic enzyme elevation and should be used with caution in the presence of hepatic disease.

The STOP-NIDDM trial demonstrated that a-glucosidase therapy in prediabetic individuals successfully prevented a significant number of new cases of type 2 diabetes and helped restore B-cell function, in addition to reducing cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Intervention with acarbose also reduced cardiovascular events in individuals with diabetes. Diabetes and cardiovascular disease prevention may become a further indication for this class of medications.

\section*{PRAMLI NTI DE}

Pramlintide, a synthetic analog of amylin, is an injectable antihyperglycemic that modulates postprandial glucose levels and is approved for preprandial use in individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is administered in addition to insulin in those individuals who are unable to achieve their target postprandial blood sugars. Pramlintide suppresses glucagon release via undetermined mechanisms, delays gastric emptying, and has central nervous system-mediated anorectic effects. It is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; levels peak within 20 minutes, and the duration of action is not more than 150 minutes. Pramlintide is renally metabolized and excreted, but even at low creatinine clearance there is no significant change in bioavailability. It has not been evaluated in dialysis patients. The most reliable absorption is from the abdomen and thigh; arm administration is less reliable. Pramlintide should be injected immediately before eating; doses range from 15 mcg to 120 mcg subcutaneously. Therapy with this agent should be initiated with the lowest dose and titrated upward. Because of the risk of hypoglycemia, concurrent rapid- or short-acting mealtime insulin doses should be decreased by 50\% or more. Pramlintide should always be injected by itself with a separate syringe; it cannot be mixed with insulin. The major side effects of pramlintide are hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and anorexia.

\section*{EXENATIDE}

As a synthetic analog of glucagon-like-polypeptide 1 (GLP-1), exenatide is the first incretin therapy to become available for the treatment of diabetes. Exenatide is approved as an injectable, adjunctive therapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin or sulfonylureas who still have suboptimal glycemic control. In clinical studies, exenatide therapy is shown to have multiple actions such as potentiation of glucosemediated insulin secretion, suppression of postprandial glucagon release through as-yet unknown mechanisms, slowed gastric emptying and a central loss of appetite. The increased insulin secretion is speculated to be due in part to an increase in B-cell mass. It is not known whether the increased B-cell mass results from a decreased B-cell turnover, increased B-cell formation, or both.

Exenatide is absorbed equally from arm, abdomen, or thigh injection sites, reaching a peak concentration in approximately 2 hours with a duration of up to 10 hours. It undergoes glomerular filtration, and dosage adjustment is required only when the creatinine clearance is less than $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. Exenatide is injected subcutaneously within 60 minutes before a meal; therapy is initiated at 5 mcg twice daily, with a maximum dosage of 10 mcg twice daily. When exenatide is added to preexisting sulfonylurea therapy, the oral hypoglycemic dosage may need to be decreased to prevent hypoglycemia. The major side effects are nausea (about 44\% of users) and vomiting and diarrhea. The nausea decreases with ongoing exenatide usage.

\section*{SITAGLI PTI N}

Sitagliptin is an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), the enzyme that degrades incretin and other GLP-1-like molecules. This drug appears likely to be approved for use in type 2 diabetes. In phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, sitagliptin was reported to have a bioavailability of approximately $80 \%$ and a half-life of $8-14$ hours. Control of hyperglycemia and reductions in $\mathrm{HbA}_{1 \mathrm{c}}$ were documented at doses of 100 mg orally once daily. Dosage should be reduced in patients with renal impairment. Hypoglycemic episodes were rare and the drug facilitated weight loss. Sitagliptin therapy can be combined with metformin, Tzds, or sulfonylureas. The drug will be marketed as J anuvia.

\section*{COMBI NATI ON THERAPY WITH ORAL ANTI DI ABETI C AGENTS \& I NJ ECTABLE MEDI CATI ON}

\section*{COMBINATION THERAPY IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS}

\section*{Combination Therapy with Exenatide}

Exenatide is approved for use in individuals who fail to achieve desired glycemic control on biguanides, sulfonylureas, or both. Although the combination of exenatide and Tzds, D - phenylalanine derivatives, meglitinides, ar-glucosidase inhibitors, and insulin has not been studied, these regimens are clinically prescribed. Hypoglycemia is a risk when exenatide is used with an insulin secretagogue or insulin. The doses of the latter drugs have to be reduced at the initiation of exenatide therapy and subsequently titrated.

\section*{Combination Therapy with Pramlintide}

Pramlintide is approved for concurrent mealtime administration in individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin, metformin, or a sulfonylurea who are unable to achieve their postmeal glucose targets. Combination therapy results in a significant reduction in early postprandial glucose excursions; mealtime insulin or sulfonylurea doses usually have to be reduced to prevent hypoglycemia.

\section*{Combination Therapy with Insulin}

Bedtime insulin has been suggested as an adjunct to oral antidiabetic therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes patients who have not responded to maximal oral therapy. Clinical practice has evolved to include sulfonylureas, meglitinides, D -phenylalanine derivatives, biguanides, thiazolidinediones, or a-glucosidase
inhibitors given in conjunction with insulin.
Individuals unable to achieve glycemic control with bedtime insulin as described above generally require full insulin replacement and multiple daily injections of insulin. Insulin secretagogues are redundant when an individual is receiving multiple daily insulin injections, but persons with severe insulin resistance may benefit from the addition of one of the biguanides, thiazolidinediones, or a.-glucosidase inhibitors. In some cases, multiple oral agents have been required together with insulin. When oral agents are added to the regimen of a person already taking insulin, the blood glucose should be closely monitored and the insulin dosage decreased as needed to avoid hypoglycemia.

\section*{COMBINATION THERAPY IN TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS}

\section*{Combination Therapy with Pramlintide}

Pramlintide is approved for concurrent mealtime administration in individuals with type 1 diabetes who have poor glucose control after eating despite optimal insulin therapy. The addition of pramlintide leads to a significant reduction in early postprandial glucose excursions; mealtime insulin doses usually have to be reduced to prevent hypoglycemia.

\section*{Combination Therapy with Oral Medications}

There is no indication for combining insulin with insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas, meglitinides, or D phenylalanine derivatives) in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetics with diets very high in starch may benefit from the addition of a-glucosidase inhibitors, but this is not typically practiced in the USA. Although not approved for use in type 1 diabetes, Tzds have been prescribed for type 1 individuals with significant insulin resistance and a combined type 1, type 2 phenotype, or latent autoimmune diabetes mellitus of adulthood (LADA). The insulin dose has to be reduced with the addition of Tzd therapy to prevent hypoglycemia.

\section*{GLUCAGON}

\section*{Chemistry \& Metabolism}

Glucagon is synthesized in the A cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans (see Table 41-1). Glucagon is a peptide-identical in all mammals-consisting of a single chain of 29 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 3485. Selective proteolytic cleavage converts a large precursor molecule of approximately $18,000 \mathrm{MW}$ to glucagon. One of the precursor intermediates consists of a 69-amino-acid peptide called glicentin, which contains the glucagon sequence interposed between peptide extensions.

Glucagon is extensively degraded in the liver and kidney as well as in plasma and at its tissue receptor sites. Because of its rapid inactivation by plasma, chilling of the collecting tubes and addition of inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes are necessary when samples of blood are collected for immunoassay of circulating glucagon. Its half-life in plasma is between 3 and 6 minutes, which is similar to that of insulin.

\section*{"Gut Glucagon"}

Glicentin immunoreactivity has been found in cells of the small intestine as well as in pancreatic A cells and in effluents of perfused pancreas. The intestinal cells secrete enteroglucagon, a family of glucagon-like peptides, of which glicentin is a member, along with glucagon-like peptides 1 and 2 (GLP-1 and GLP-2). Unlike the pancreatic A cell, these intestinal cells lack the enzymes to convert glucagon precursors to true glucagon by removing the carboxyl terminal extension from the molecule.

The function of the enteroglucagons has not been clarified, although smaller peptides can bind hepatic glucagon receptors where they exert partial activity. A derivative of the 37-amino-acid form of GLP-1 that lacks the first six amino acids (GLP-1[7-37]) is a potent stimulant of insulin release. It represents the predominant form of GLP in the human intestine and has been termed "insulinotropin." It has been considered as a potential therapeutic agent in type 2 diabetes. However, it requires continuous subcutaneous infusion to produce a sustained lowering of both fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic patients; therefore, its clinical usefulness is limited. Exenatide (see above) is an analog of GLP-1.

\section*{Pharmacologic Effects of Glucagon}

\section*{METABOLIC EFFECTS}

The first six amino acids at the amino terminal of the glucagon molecule bind to specific receptors on liver cells. This leads to $a G_{s}$ protein-coupled increase in adenylyl cyclase activity and the production of cAMP, which facilitates catabolism of stored glycogen and increases gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis. The immediate pharmacologic result of glucagon infusion is to raise blood glucose at the expense of stored hepatic glycogen. There is no effect on skeletal muscle glycogen, presumably because of the lack of glucagon receptors on skeletal muscle. Pharmacologic amounts of glucagon cause release of insulin from normal pancreatic B cells, catecholamines from pheochromocytoma, and calcitonin from medullary carcinoma cells.

\section*{CARDI AC EFFECTS}

Glucagon has a potent inotropic and chronotropic effect on the heart, mediated by the cAMP mechanism described above. Thus, it produces an effect very similar to that of B-adrenoceptor agonists without requiring functioning Breceptors.

\section*{EFFECTS ON SMOOTH MUSCLE}

Large doses of glucagon produce profound relaxation of the intestine. In contrast to the above effects of the peptide, this action on the intestine may be due to mechanisms other than adenylyl cyclase activation.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA}

The major use of glucagon is for emergency treatment of severe hypoglycemic reactions in patients with type 1 diabetes when unconsciousness precludes oral feedings and intravenous glucose is not possible.
Recombinant glucagon is currently available in $1-\mathrm{mg}$ vials for parenteral use (Glucagon Emergency Kit). Nasal sprays have been developed for this purpose but have not yet received FDA approval.

\section*{ENDOCRINE DIAGNOSIS}

Several tests use glucagon to diagnose endocrine disorders. In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, a standard test of pancreatic B-cell secretory reserve uses 1 mg of glucagon administered as an intravenous bolus. Because insulin-treated patients develop circulating anti-insulin antibodies that interfere with radioimmunoassays of insulin, measurements of C-peptide are used to indicate B-cell secretion.

\section*{BETA-BLOCKER POISONING}

Glucagon is sometimes useful for reversing the cardiac effects of an overdose of B-blocking agents because of its ability to increase cAMP production in the heart. However, it is not clinically useful in the treatment of cardiac failure.

\section*{RADIOLOGY OF THE BOWEL}

Glucagon has been used extensively in radiology as an aid to x-ray visualization of the bowel because of its
ability to relax the intestine.

\section*{Adverse Reactions}

Transient nausea and occasional vomiting can result from glucagon administration. These are generally mild, and glucagon is relatively free of severe adverse reactions.

\section*{I SLET AMYLOI D POLYPEPTI DE (I APP, AMYLI N)}

Amylin is a 37-amino-acid peptide originally derived from islet amyloid deposits in pancreas material from patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes or insulinomas. It is produced by pancreatic B cells, packaged within B-cell granules in a concentration 1-2\% that of insulin and co-secreted with insulin in a pulsatile manner and in response to physiologic secretory stimuli. Approximately 1 molecule of amylin is released for every 10 molecules of insulin. It circulates in a glycated (active) and nonglycated (inactive) form with physiologic concentrations ranging from $4-25 \mathrm{pmol} / \mathrm{L}$ and is primarily renally excreted. Amylin appears to be a member of the superfamily of neuroregulatory peptides, with $46 \%$ homology with the calcitonin gene-related peptide CGRP (see Chapter 17). The physiologic effect of amylin may be to modulate insulin release by acting as a negative feed back on insulin secretion. At pharmacologic doses, amylin reduces glucagon secretion, slows gastric emptying by a vagally medicated mechanism, and centrally decreases appetite. An analog of amylin, pramlintide (see above), differs from amylin by the substitution of proline at positions 25, 28, and 29. These modifications make pramlintide soluble and non-self-aggregating.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY}

Calcium and phosphate, the major mineral constituents of bone, are also two of the most important minerals for general cellular function. Accordingly, the body has evolved a complex set of mechanisms by which calcium and phosphate homeostasis are carefully maintained (Figure 42-1). Approximately $98 \%$ of the $1-2 \mathrm{~kg}$ of calcium and $85 \%$ of the 1 kg of phosphorus in the human adult are found in bone, the principal reservoir for these minerals. These functions are dynamic, with constant remodeling of bone and ready exchange of bone mineral with that in the extracellular fluid. Bone also serves as the principal structural support for the body and provides the space for hematopoiesis. Thus, abnormalities in bone mineral homeostasis can lead not only to a wide variety of cellular dysfunctions (eg, tetany, coma, muscle weakness) but also to disturbances in structural support of the body (eg, osteoporosis with fractures) and loss of hematopoietic capacity (eg, infantile osteopetrosis).

Figure 42-1.

Some mechanisms contributing to bone mineral homeostasis. Direct actions are shown and feedback may alter the net effect. Calcium and phosphorus concentrations in the serum are controlled principally by two hormones, $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}_{3}(\mathrm{D})$ and parathyroid hormone (PTH), through their action on absorption from the gut and from bone and on excretion in the urine. Both hormones increase input of calcium and phosphorus from bone into the serum; both hormones also stimulate bone formation; vitamin D also increases absorption from the gut. Vitamin D decreases urinary excretion of both calcium and phosphorus, whereas PTH reduces calcium but increases phosphorus excretion. Calcitonin (CT) is a less critical hormone for calcium homeostasis, but in pharmacologic
concentrations CT can reduce serum calcium and phosphorus by inhibiting bone resorption and stimulating their renal excretion. FGF23 is a recently discovered hormone that stimulates renal excretion of phosphate. Feedback may alter the effects shown; for example, vitamin D usually increases urinary calcium excretion because of effects on calcium absorption from the gut and effects on PTH.

Calcium and phosphate enter the body from the intestine. The average American diet provides $600-1000 \mathrm{mg}$ of calcium per day, of which approximately $100-250 \mathrm{mg}$ is absorbed. This figure represents net absorption, because both absorption (principally in the duodenum and upper jejunum) and secretion (principally in the ileum) occur. The amount of phosphorus in the American diet is about the same as that of calcium. However, the efficiency of absorption (principally in the jejunum) is greater, ranging from $70 \%$ to $90 \%$, depending on intake. In the steady state, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate balances intestinal absorption. In general, over $98 \%$ of filtered calcium and $85 \%$ of filtered phosphate is reabsorbed by the kidney. The movement of calcium and phosphate across the intestinal and renal epithelia is closely regulated. Intrinsic disease of the intestine (eg, nontropical sprue) or kidney (eg, chronic renal failure) disrupts bone mineral homeostasis.

Two hormones serve as the principal regulators of calcium and phosphate homeostasis: the peptide parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the steroid vitamin D (Figure 42-2). Vitamin D is a prohormone rather than a true hormone, because it must be further metabolized to gain biologic activity. PTH stimulates the production of the active metabolite of vitamin $\mathrm{D}, 1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D} .1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$, on the other hand, suppresses the production of PTH. $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ stimulates the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ and PTH promote both bone formation and resorption in part by stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Both PTH and $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ enhance renal retention of calcium, but PTH promotes renal phosphate excretion. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a newly discovered hormone that stimulates renal phosphate excretion and inhibits renal production of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$. Other hormones-calcitonin, prolactin, growth hormone, insulin, thyroid hormone, glucocorticoids, and sex steroids-influence calcium and phosphate homeostasis under certain physiologic circumstances and can be considered secondary regulators. Deficiency or excess of these secondary regulators within a physiologic range does not produce the disturbance of calcium and phosphate homeostasis that is observed in situations of deficiency or excess of PTH and vitamin D. However, certain of these secondary regulators-especially calcitonin, glucocorticoids, and estrogens-are useful therapeutically and are discussed in subsequent sections.

In addition to these hormonal regulators, calcium and phosphate themselves, other ions such as
sodium and fluoride, and a variety of drugs (bisphosphonates, plicamycin, and diuretics) also alter calcium and phosphate homeostasis.

\section*{Principal Hormonal Regulators of Bone Mineral Homeostasis PARATHYROID HORMONE}

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a single-chain peptide hormone composed of 84 amino acids. It is produced in the parathyroid gland in a precursor form of 115 amino acids, the remaining 31 amino terminal amino acids being cleaved off before secretion. Within the gland is a calcium-sensitive protease capable of cleaving the intact hormone into fragments. Biologic activity resides in the amino terminal region such that synthetic 1-34 PTH is fully active. Loss of the first two amino terminal amino acids eliminates most biologic activity.

The metabolic clearance of intact PTH is rapid, with a half-time of disappearance measured in minutes. Most of the clearance occurs in the liver and kidney. The biologically inactive carboxyl terminal fragments produced during metabolism of the intact hormone have a much lower clearance, especially in renal failure. This accounts in part for the very high PTH values often observed in the past in patients with renal failure when measured by radioimmunoassays directed against the carboxyl terminal region of the molecule. However, most PTH assays currently in use measure the intact hormone by a double antibody method, so that this circumstance is less frequently encountered in clinical practice. PTH regulates calcium and phosphate flux across cellular membranes in bone and kidney, resulting in increased serum calcium and decreased serum phosphate. In bone, PTH increases the activity and number of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. However, this stimulation of osteoclasts is not a direct effect. Rather, PTH acts on the osteoblast (the bone-forming cell) to induce a membrane-bound protein called RANK ligand (RANKL). This factor acts on osteoclasts and osteoclast precursors to increase both the numbers and the activity of osteoclasts. This action increases bone turnover or bone remodeling, a specific sequence of cellular events initiated by osteoclastic bone resorption and followed by osteoblastic bone formation. Although both bone resorption and bone formation are enhanced by PTH, the net effect of excess PTH is to increase bone resorption. PTH in low and intermittent doses increases bone formation without first stimulating bone resorption. This action appears to be indirect, involving other growth factors such as IGF-1. This has led to the recent approval of recombinant PTH 1-34 (teriparatide) for the treatment of osteoporosis. In the kidney, PTH increases the ability of the nephron to reabsorb calcium and magnesium but reduces its ability to reabsorb phosphate, amino acids, bicarbonate, sodium, chloride, and sulfate. Another important action of PTH on the kidney is its stimulation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D $\left(1,25[\mathrm{OH}]_{2} \mathrm{D}\right)$ production.

\section*{VITAMIN D}

Vitamin D is a secosteroid produced in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol under the influence of ultraviolet irradiation. Vitamin D is also found in certain foods and is used to supplement dairy products. Both the natural form (vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{3}$, cholecalciferol) and the plant-derived form (vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$, ergocalciferol) are present in the diet. These forms differ in that ergocalciferol contains a double bond ( $\mathrm{C}_{22-23}$ ) and an additional methyl group in the side chain (Figure 42-3). In humans, this difference apparently is of limited physiologic consequence (although ergocalciferol is less potent), and the following comments apply equally well to both forms of vitamin D.

Figure 42-3.
(cholecalciferol)

Conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ and metabolism of $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ to $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}_{3}$ and $24,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}_{3}$. Control of the latter step is exerted primarily at the level of the kidney, where low serum phosphorus, low serum calcium, and high parathyroid hormone favor the production of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}_{3}$. The inset shows the side chain for ergosterol. Ergosterol undergoes similar transformation to vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ (ergocalciferol), which, in turn, is metabolized to $25(\mathrm{OH}) \mathrm{D}_{2}, 1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}_{2}$, and $24,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}_{2}$. In humans, corresponding $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ derivatives have equivalent effects and potency. They are therefore referred to in the text without a subscript.

Vitamin D is a prohormone that serves as precursor to a number of biologically active metabolites (Figure 42-3). Vitamin D is first hydroxylated in the liver to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). This metabolite is further converted in the kidney to a number of other forms, the best-studied of which are 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin $\mathrm{D}\left(1,25[\mathrm{OH}]_{2} \mathrm{D}\right)$ and 24,25 -dihydroxyvitamin $\mathrm{D}\left(24,25[\mathrm{OH}]_{2} \mathrm{D}\right)$. Of the natural metabolites, only vitamin D and 1,25(OH) ${ }_{2} \mathrm{D}$ (as calcitriol) are available for clinical use (Table 42-1). Moreover, a number of analogs of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ are being synthesized to extend the usefulness of this metabolite to a variety of nonclassic conditions. Calcipotriene (calcipotriol), for example, is being used to treat psoriasis, a hyperproliferative skin disorder. Doxercalciferol and paricalcitol have
recently been approved for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease. Other analogs are being investigated for the treatment of various malignancies. The regulation of vitamin D metabolism is complex, involving calcium, phosphate, and a variety of hormones, the most important of which is PTH, which stimulates the production of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ by the kidney.

Vitamin D and its metabolites circulate in plasma tightly bound to a carrier protein, the vitamin Dbinding protein. This a vitamin D and $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ with lower affinity. In normal subjects, the terminal half-life of injected calcifediol is 23 days, whereas in anephric subjects it is 42 days. The half-life of $24,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ is probably similar. Tracer studies with vitamin D have shown a rapid clearance from the blood. The liver appears to be the principal organ for clearance. Excess vitamin D is stored in adipose tissue. The metabolic clearance of calcitriol in humans indicates a rapid turnover, with a terminal half-life measured in hours. Several of the $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ analogs are bound poorly by the vitamin D-binding protein. As a result, their clearance is very rapid, with a terminal half-life measured in minutes. Such analogs have little of the hypercalcemic, hypercalciuric effects of calcitriol, an important aspect of their use for the management of conditions such as psoriasis and hyperparathyroidism.

The mechanism of action of the vitamin D metabolites remains under active investigation. However, calcitriol is well established as the most potent agent with respect to stimulation of intestinal calcium and phosphate transport and bone resorption. Calcitriol appears to act on the intestine both by induction of new protein synthesis (eg, calcium-binding protein) and by modulation of calcium flux across the brush border and basolateral membranes by a means that does not require new protein synthesis. The molecular action of calcitriol on bone has received less attention. However, like PTH, calcitriol can induce RANK ligand in osteoblasts and proteins such as osteocalcin, which may regulate the mineralization process. The metabolites $25(\mathrm{OH}) \mathrm{D}$ and $24,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ are far less potent stimulators of intestinal calcium and phosphate transport or bone resorption. However, $25(\mathrm{OH}) \mathrm{D}$ appears to be more potent than $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ in stimulating renal reabsorption of calcium and phosphate and may be the major metabolite regulating calcium flux and contractility in muscle. Specific receptors for $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ exist in target tissues. However, the role and even the existence of separate receptors for $25(\mathrm{OH}) \mathrm{D}$ and $24,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ remain controversial.

The receptor for $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ exists in a wide variety of tissues-not just bone, gut, and kidney. In these "nonclassic" tissues, $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ exerts a number of actions including regulation of parathyroid hormone secretion from the parathyroid gland, insulin secretion from the pancreas, cytokine production by macrophages and T cells, and proliferation and differentiation of a large number of cells, including cancer cells. Thus, the clinical utility of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ analogs is likely to expand.

\section*{I NTERACTI ON OF PTH \& VITAMI N D}

A summary of the principal actions of PTH and vitamin D on the three main target tissues-intestine, kidney, and bone-is presented in Table 42-2. The net effect of PTH is to raise serum calcium and reduce serum phosphate; the net effect of vitamin D is to raise both. Regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis is achieved through a variety of feedback loops. Calcium is the principal regulator of PTH secretion. It binds to a novel ion recognition site that is part of a $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{q}}$ protein-coupled receptor called the calcium sensing receptor (CaR) and links changes in intracellular free calcium concentration to changes in extracellular calcium. As serum calcium levels rise and bind to this receptor, intracellular calcium levels increase and inhibit PTH secretion. Phosphate regulates PTH secretion directly and indirectly by forming complexes with calcium in the serum. Because it is the ionized free concentration of calcium that is detected by the parathyroid gland, increases in serum phosphate levels reduce the ionized calcium and lead to enhanced PTH secretion. Such feedback regulation is appropriate to the net effect of PTH to raise serum calcium and reduce serum phosphate levels. Likewise, both calcium and phosphate at high levels reduce the amount of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ produced by the kidney and increase the amount of $24,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ produced. The high calcium works directly and indirectly by reducing PTH secretion. The high phosphate works directly and indirectly by increasing FGF23 levels. Since $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ raises serum calcium and phosphate, whereas $24,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ has less effect, such feedback regulation is again appropriate. $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ itself directly inhibits PTH secretion (independently of its effect on serum calcium) by a direct action on PTH gene transcription. This provides yet another negative feedback loop. The ability of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ to inhibit PTH secretion directly is being exploited using calcitriol analogs that have less effect on serum calcium because of their lesser effect on intestinal calcium absorption. Such drugs are proving useful in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism accompanying chronic kidney disease and may be useful in selected cases of primary hyperparathyroidism.

${ }^{1}$ Direct effect. Vitamin D often increases urine calcium owing to increased calcium absorption from the intestine and resulting decreased PTH.

\section*{Secondary Hormonal Regulators of Bone Mineral Homeostasis}

A number of hormones modulate the actions of PTH and vitamin D in regulating bone mineral homeostasis. Compared with that of PTH and vitamin D, the physiologic impact of such secondary regulation on bone mineral homeostasis is minor. However, in pharmacologic amounts, a number of these hormones have actions on the bone mineral homeostatic mechanisms that can be exploited therapeutically.

\section*{CALCITONIN}

The calcitonin secreted by the parafollicular cells of the mammalian thyroid is a single-chain peptide hormone with 32 amino acids and a molecular weight of 3600. A disulfide bond between positions 1 and 7 is essential for biologic activity. Calcitonin is produced from a precursor with MW 15,000. The circulating forms of calcitonin are multiple, ranging in size from the monomer (MW 3600) to forms with an apparent molecular weight of 60,000 . Whether such heterogeneity includes precursor forms or covalently linked oligomers is not known. Because of its heterogeneity, calcitonin is standardized by bioassay in rats. Activity is compared to a standard maintained by the British Medical Research Council (MRC) and expressed as MRC units.

Human calcitonin monomer has a half-life of about 10 minutes with a metabolic clearance of 8-9 $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$. Salmon calcitonin has a longer half-life and a reduced metabolic clearance ( $3 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ ), making it more attractive as a therapeutic agent. Much of the clearance occurs in the kidney, although
little intact calcitonin appears in the urine.
The principal effects of calcitonin are to lower serum calcium and phosphate by actions on bone and kidney. Calcitonin inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption. Although bone formation is not impaired at first after calcitonin administration, with time both formation and resorption of bone are reduced. In the kidney, calcitonin reduces both calcium and phosphate reabsorption as well as reabsorption of other ions, including sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Tissues other than bone and kidney are also affected by calcitonin. Calcitonin in pharmacologic amounts decreases gastrin secretion and reduces gastric acid output while increasing secretion of sodium, potassium, chloride, and water in the gut. Pentagastrin is a potent stimulator of calcitonin secretion (as is hypercalcemia), suggesting a possible physiologic relationship between gastrin and calcitonin. In the adult human, no readily demonstrable problem develops in cases of calcitonin deficiency (thyroidectomy) or excess (medullary carcinoma of the thyroid). However, the ability of calcitonin to block bone resorption and lower serum calcium makes it a useful drug for the treatment of Paget's disease, hypercalcemia, and osteoporosis.

\section*{GLUCOCORTI COI DS}

Glucocorticoid hormones alter bone mineral homeostasis by antagonizing vitamin D-stimulated intestinal calcium transport, by stimulating renal calcium excretion, and by blocking bone formation. Although these observations underscore the negative impact of glucocorticoids on bone mineral homeostasis, these hormones have proved useful in reversing the hypercalcemia associated with lymphomas and granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis (in which production of $1,25[\mathrm{OH}]_{2} \mathrm{D}$ is increased) or in cases of vitamin D intoxication. Prolonged administration of glucocorticoids is a common cause of osteoporosis in adults and stunted skeletal development in children.

\section*{ESTROGENS}

Estrogens can prevent accelerated bone loss during the immediate postmenopausal period and at least transiently increase bone in the postmenopausal woman. The prevailing hypothesis advanced to explain these observations is that estrogens reduce the bone-resorbing action of PTH. Estrogen administration leads to an increased $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ level in blood, but estrogens have no direct effect on $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ production in vitro. The increased $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ levels in vivo following estrogen treatment may result from decreased serum calcium and phosphate and increased PTH. Estrogen receptors have been found in bone, and estrogen has direct effects on bone remodeling. Recent case reports of men who lack the estrogen receptor or who are unable to produce estrogen because of aromatase deficiency noted marked osteopenia and failure to close epiphyses. This further substantiates the role of estrogen in bone development, even in men. The principal therapeutic application for estrogen administration in disorders of bone mineral homeostasis is the treatment or prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, long-term use of estrogen is being discouraged because of its deleterious side effects. Rather, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have been developed to retain the beneficial effects on bone while minimizing these deleterious side effects on breast, uterus, and the cardiovascular system (see Newer Therapies for Osteoporosis).

\section*{Newer Therapies for Osteoporosis}

Bone undergoes a continuous remodeling process involving bone resorption and formation. Any process that disrupts this balance by increasing resorption relative to formation results in osteoporosis. Inadequate sex hormone production is a major cause of osteoporosis in men and women. Estrogen replacement therapy at menopause is a well-established means of preventing osteoporosis in the female, but many women fear its adverse effects, particularly the increased risk of breast cancer from continued estrogen use (the well-demonstrated increased risk of endometrial cancer is prevented by cycling with a progestin) and do not like the persistence of menstrual bleeding that often accompanies this form of therapy. Medical enthusiasm for this treatment has waned with the demonstration that it does not protect against heart disease. Raloxifene is the first of the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs; see Chapter 40) to be approved for the prevention of osteoporosis. Raloxifene shares some of the beneficial effects of estrogen on bone without increasing the risk of breast or endometrial cancer (it may actually reduce the risk of breast cancer). Although not as effective as estrogen in increasing bone density, raloxifene has been shown to reduce vertebral fractures.

Nonhormonal forms of therapy for osteoporosis with proven efficacy in reducing fracture risk have also been developed. Bisphosphonates such as alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate have been conclusively shown to increase bone density and reduce fractures over at least 5 years when used continuously at a dosage of $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ or $70 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{wk}$ for alendronate and $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ or $35 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{wk}$ for risedronate, $2.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ or $150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mo}$ for ibandronate. Side-byside trials between alendronate and calcitonin (another approved nonestrogen drug for osteoporosis) indicated a greater efficacy of alendronate. Bisphosphonates are poorly absorbed and must be given on an empty stomach or infused intravenously. At the higher oral doses used in the treatment of Paget's disease, alendronate causes gastric irritation, but this is not a significant problem at the doses recommended for osteoporosis when patients are instructed to take the drug with a glass of water and remain upright. The most recently approved drug for osteoporosis is teriparatide, the recombinant form of $\mathrm{PTH}_{1-34}$. Unlike other approved drugs for osteoporosis, teriparatide stimulates bone formation rather than inhibiting bone resorption. However, teriparatide must be given daily by subcutaneous injection. Its efficacy in preventing fractures appears to be at least as great as that of the bisphosphonates. In all cases, adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D needs to be maintained.

Thus, we now have several well-validated, efficacious forms of treatment for this common debilitating disease.

\section*{Nonhormonal Agents Affecting Bone Mineral Homeostasis BISPHOSPHONATES}

The bisphosphonates are analogs of pyrophosphate in which the P-O-P bond has been replaced with a nonhydrolyzable P-C-P bond (Figure 42-4). Etidronate, pamidronate, and alendronate have now been joined by risedronate, tiludronate, ibandronate, and zoledronate for clinical use. The bisphosphonates owe at least part of their clinical usefulness and toxicity to their ability to retard formation and dissolution of hydroxyapatite crystals within and outside the skeletal system. They
localize to regions of bone resorption and so exert their greatest effects on osteoclasts. However, the exact mechanism by which they selectively inhibit bone resorption is not clear.

The structure of pyrophosphate and of the first three bisphosphonates-etidronate, pamidronate, and alendronate-that were approved for use in the USA.

The results from animal and clinical studies indicate that less than 10\% of an oral dose of these drugs is absorbed. Food reduces absorption even further, necessitating their administration on an empty stomach. Because it causes gastric irritation, pamidronate is not available as an oral preparation. However, with the possible exception of etidronate, all currently available bisphosphonates have this complication. Nearly half of the absorbed drug accumulates in bone; the remainder is excreted unchanged in the urine. Decreased renal function, esophageal motility disorders, and peptic ulcer disease are the main contraindications to the use of these drugs. The portion bound to bone is retained for months, depending on the turnover of bone itself.

Etidronate and the other bisphosphonates exert a variety of effects on bone mineral homeostasis. In particular, bisphosphonates are useful for the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, for Paget's disease, and for osteoporosis (See Newer Therapies for Osteoporosis). Contrary to expectations, alendronate appears to increase bone mineral density well beyond the 2-year period predicted for a drug whose effects are limited to blocking bone resorption. The bisphosphonates exert
a variety of other cellular effects, including inhibition of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ production, inhibition of intestinal calcium transport, metabolic changes in bone cells such as inhibition of glycolysis, inhibition of cell growth, and changes in acid and alkaline phosphatase.

Amino bisphosphonates such as alendronate have recently been found to block farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway that appears to be critical for osteoclast survival. Statins, which block mevalonate synthesis, stimulate bone formation at least in animal studies. Thus, the mevalonate pathway appears to be important in bone cell function and provides new targets for drug development. These effects vary depending on the bisphosphonate being studied (ie, only amino bisphosphonates have this property) and may account for some of the clinical differences observed in the effects of the various bisphosphonates on bone mineral homeostasis. However, with the exceptions of the induction of a mineralization defect by higher than approved doses of etidronate and gastric and esophageal irritation by pamidronate and by high doses of alendronate, these drugs have proved to be remarkably free of adverse effects when used at the doses recommended for the treatment of osteoporosis. Higher doses used in the treatment of hypercalcemia have been associated with renal deterioration and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Esophageal irritation can be minimized by taking the drug with a full glass of water and remaining upright for 30 minutes.

\section*{CALCI MI METI CS}

Cinacalcet is the first representative of a new class of drugs that activates the calcium sensing receptor (CaR). CaR is widely distributed but has its greatest concentration in the parathyroid gland. Cinacalcet blocks PTH secretion by this mechanism and is approved for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease and for the treatment of parathyroid carcinoma.

\section*{PLI CAMYCI N (MITHRAMYCIN)}

Plicamycin is a cytotoxic antibiotic (see Chapter 55) that has been used clinically for two disorders of bone mineral metabolism: Paget's disease and hypercalcemia. The cytotoxic properties of the drug appear to involve its binding to DNA and interruption of DNA-directed RNA synthesis. The reasons for its usefulness in the treatment of Paget's disease and hypercalcemia are unclear but may relate to the need for protein synthesis to sustain bone resorption. The doses required to treat Paget's disease and hypercalcemia are about one tenth the amounts required to achieve cytotoxic effects.

\section*{THI AZI DES}

The chemistry and pharmacology of this family of drugs are covered in Chapter 15. The principal application of thiazides in the treatment of bone mineral disorders is in reducing renal calcium excretion. Thiazides may increase the effectiveness of parathyroid hormone in stimulating reabsorption of calcium by the renal tubules or may act on calcium reabsorption secondarily by increasing sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule. In the distal tubule, thiazides block sodium reabsorption at the luminal surface, increasing the calcium-sodium exchange at the basolateral membrane and thus enhancing calcium reabsorption into the blood at this site. Thiazides have proved to be useful in reducing the hypercalciuria and incidence of stone formation in subjects with idiopathic hypercalciuria. Part of their efficacy in reducing stone formation may lie in their ability to decrease urine oxalate excretion and increase urine magnesium and zinc levels (both of which inhibit calcium oxalate stone formation).

\section*{FLUORIDE}

Fluoride is well established as effective for the prophylaxis of dental caries and has been under investigation for the treatment of osteoporosis. Both therapeutic applications originated from epidemiologic observations that subjects living in areas with naturally fluoridated water (1-2 ppm) had less dental caries and fewer vertebral compression fractures than subjects living in nonfluoridated water areas. Fluoride is accumulated by bones and teeth, where it may stabilize the hydroxyapatite crystal. Such a mechanism may explain the effectiveness of fluoride in increasing the resistance of teeth to dental caries, but it does not explain new bone growth.

Fluoride in drinking water appears to be most effective in preventing dental caries if consumed before the eruption of the permanent teeth. The optimum concentration in drinking water supplies is 0.5-1 ppm. Topical application is most effective if done just as the teeth erupt. There is little further benefit to giving fluoride after the permanent teeth are fully formed. Excess fluoride in drinking water leads to mottling of the enamel proportionate to the concentration above 1 ppm.

Because of the paucity of agents that stimulate new bone growth in patients with osteoporosis, fluoride for this disorder has been examined (see Osteoporosis, below). Results of earlier studies indicated that fluoride alone without adequate calcium supplementation produced osteomalacia. More recent studies, in which calcium supplementation has been adequate, have demonstrated an improvement in calcium balance, an increase in bone mineral, and an increase in trabecular bone volume. However, studies of the ability of fluoride to reduce fractures reach opposite conclusions. Adverse effects observed-at the doses used for testing fluoride's effect on bone-include nausea and vomiting, gastrointestinal blood loss, arthralgias, and arthritis in a substantial proportion of patients. Such effects are usually responsive to reduction of the dose or giving fluoride with meals (or both). At present, fluoride is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in osteoporosis.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY}

Disorders of bone mineral homeostasis generally present with abnormalities in serum or urine calcium levels (or both), often accompanied by abnormal serum phosphate levels. These abnormal mineral concentrations may themselves cause symptoms requiring immediate treatment (eg, coma in malignant hypercalcemia, tetany in hypocalcemia). More commonly, they serve as clues to an underlying disorder in hormonal regulators (eg, primary hyperparathyroidism), target tissue response (eg, chronic kidney disease), or drug misuse (eg, vitamin D intoxication). In such cases, treatment of the underlying disorder is of prime importance.

Since bone and kidney play central roles in bone mineral homeostasis, conditions that alter bone mineral homeostasis usually affect one or both of these tissues secondarily. Effects on bone can result in osteoporosis (abnormal loss of bone; remaining bone histologically normal), osteomalacia (abnormal bone formation due to inadequate mineralization), or osteitis fibrosa (excessive bone resorption with fibrotic replacement of resorption cavities and marrow). Biochemical markers of skeletal involvement include changes in serum levels of the skeletal isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin (reflecting osteoblastic activity) and urine levels of hydroxyproline and pyridinoline cross-links (reflecting osteoclastic activity). The kidney becomes involved when the calcium $\times$ phosphate product in serum exceeds the point at which ectopic calcification occurs (nephrocalcinosis) or when the calcium
$\times$ oxalate (or phosphate) product in urine exceeds saturation, leading to nephrolithiasis. Subtle early indicators of such renal involvement include polyuria, nocturia, and hyposthenuria. Radiologic evidence of nephrocalcinosis and stones is not generally observed until later. The degree of the ensuing renal failure is best followed by monitoring the decline in creatinine clearance. On the other hand, chronic kidney disease can be a primary cause of bone disease because of altered handling of calcium and phosphate, decreased $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ production, and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

\section*{Abnormal Serum Calcium \& Phosphate Levels HYPERCALCEMI A}

Hypercalcemia causes central nervous system depression, including coma, and is potentially lethal. Its major causes (other than thiazide therapy) are hyperparathyroidism and cancer with or without bone metastases. Less common causes are hypervitaminosis D, sarcoidosis, thyrotoxicosis, milk-alkali syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, and immobilization. With the possible exception of hypervitaminosis D, the latter disorders seldom require emergency lowering of serum calcium. A number of approaches are used to manage the hypercalcemic crisis.

\section*{Saline Diuresis}

In hypercalcemia of sufficient severity to produce symptoms, rapid reduction of serum calcium is required. The first steps include rehydration with saline and diuresis with furosemide. Most patients presenting with severe hypercalcemia have a substantial component of prerenal azotemia owing to dehydration, which prevents the kidney from compensating for the rise in serum calcium by excreting more calcium in the urine. Therefore, the initial infusion of $500-1000 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$ of saline to reverse the dehydration and restore urine flow can by itself substantially lower serum calcium. The addition of a loop diuretic such as furosemide not only enhances urine flow but also inhibits calcium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle (see Chapter 15). Monitoring central venous pressure is important to forestall the development of heart failure and pulmonary edema in predisposed subjects. In many subjects, saline diuresis suffices to reduce serum calcium levels to a point at which more definitive diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition can be achieved. If this is not the case or if more prolonged medical treatment of hypercalcemia is required, the following agents are available (discussed in order of preference).

\section*{Bisphosphonates}

Pamidronate, 60-90 mg, infused over 2-4 hours, and zoledronate, 4 mg , infused over at least 15 minutes, have been approved for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy and have largely replaced the less effective etidronate for this indication. The effects generally persist for weeks, but treatment can be repeated after a 7-day interval if necessary and if renal function is not impaired. Some patients experience a self-limited flu-like syndrome after the infusion. Repeated doses of these drugs have been linked to renal deterioration and osteonecrosis of the jaw, but this adverse effect is rare.

\section*{Calcitonin}

Calcitonin has proved useful as ancillary treatment in a large number of patients. Calcitonin by itself seldom restores serum calcium to normal, and refractoriness frequently develops. However, its lack of toxicity permits frequent administration at high doses ( 200 MRC units or more). An effect on serum
calcium is observed within 4-6 hours and lasts for 6-10 hours. Calcimar (salmon calcitonin) is available for parenteral and nasal administration.

\section*{Gallium Nitrate}

Gallium nitrate is approved by the FDA for the management of hypercalcemia of malignancy and is undergoing trials for the treatment of advanced Paget's disease. This drug acts by inhibiting bone resorption. At a dosage of $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ body surface area per day given as a continuous intravenous infusion in $5 \%$ dextrose for 5 days, gallium nitrate proved superior to calcitonin in reducing serum calcium in cancer patients. Because of potential nephrotoxicity, patients should be well hydrated and have good renal output before starting the infusion.

\section*{Plicamycin (Mithramycin)}

Because of its toxicity, plicamycin (mithramycin) is not the drug of first choice for the treatment of hypercalcemia. However, when other forms of therapy fail, $25-50 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg}$ given intravenously usually lowers serum calcium substantially within $24-48$ hours. This effect can last for several days. This dose can be repeated as necessary. The most dangerous toxic effect is sudden thrombocytopenia followed by hemorrhage. Hepatic and renal toxicity can also occur. Hypocalcemia, nausea, and vomiting may limit therapy. Use of this drug must be accompanied by careful monitoring of platelet counts, liver and kidney function, and serum calcium levels.

\section*{Phosphate}

Giving intravenous phosphate is probably the fastest and surest way to reduce serum calcium, but it is a hazardous procedure if not done properly. Intravenous phosphate should be used only after other methods of treatment (bisphosphonates, calcitonin, and saline diuresis with furosemide) have failed to control symptomatic hypercalcemia. Phosphate must be given slowly ( 50 mmol or 1.5 g elemental phosphorus over 6-8 hours) and the patient switched to oral phosphate ( $1-2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ elemental phosphorus, as one of the salts indicated below) as soon as symptoms of hypercalcemia have cleared. The risks of intravenous phosphate therapy include sudden hypocalcemia, ectopic calcification, acute renal failure, and hypotension. Oral phosphate can also lead to ectopic calcification and renal failure if serum calcium and phosphate levels are not carefully monitored, but the risk is less and the time of onset much longer. Phosphate is available in oral and intravenous forms as sodium or potassium salt. Amounts required to provide 1 g of elemental phosphorus are as follows:

\section*{Intravenous:}

In-Phos: 40 mL
Hyper-Phos-K: 15 mL
Oral:
Fleet Phospho-Soda: 6.2 mL
Neutra-Phos: 300 mL
K-Phos-Neutral: 4 tablets

\section*{Glucocorticoids}

Glucocorticoids have no clear role in the acute treatment of hypercalcemia. However, the chronic
hypercalcemia of sarcoidosis, vitamin D intoxication, and certain cancers may respond within several days to glucocorticoid therapy. Prednisone in oral doses of $30-60 \mathrm{mg}$ daily is generally used, although equivalent doses of other glucocorticoids are effective. The rationale for the use of glucocorticoids in these diseases differs, however. The hypercalcemia of sarcoidosis is secondary to increased production of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$, possibly by the sarcoid tissue itself. Glucocorticoid therapy directed at the reduction of sarcoid tissue results in restoration of normal serum calcium and $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ levels. The treatment of hypervitaminosis D with glucocorticoids probably does not alter vitamin D metabolism significantly but is thought to reduce vitamin D-mediated intestinal calcium transport. An action of glucocorticoids to reduce vitamin D-mediated bone resorption has not been excluded, however. The effect of glucocorticoids on the hypercalcemia of cancer is probably twofold. The malignancies responding best to glucocorticoids (ie, multiple myeloma and related lymphoproliferative diseases) are sensitive to the lytic action of glucocorticoids. Therefore part of the effect may be related to decreased tumor mass and activity. Glucocorticoids have also been shown to inhibit the secretion or effectiveness of cytokines elaborated by multiple myeloma and related cancers that stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption. Other causes of hypercalcemia-particularly primary hyperparathyroidism-do not respond to glucocorticoid therapy.

\section*{HYPOCALCEMI A}

The main features of hypocalcemia are neuromuscular-tetany, paresthesias, laryngospasm, muscle cramps, and convulsions. The major causes of hypocalcemia in the adult are hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, chronic kidney disease, and malabsorption. Neonatal hypocalcemia is a common disorder that usually resolves without therapy. The roles of PTH, vitamin D, and calcitonin in the neonatal syndrome are under active investigation. Large infusions of citrated blood can produce hypocalcemia by the formation of citrate-calcium complexes. Calcium and vitamin D (or its metabolites) form the mainstay of treatment of hypocalcemia.

\section*{Calcium}

A number of calcium preparations are available for intravenous, intramuscular, and oral use. Calcium gluceptate ( 0.9 mEq calcium $/ \mathrm{mL}$ ), calcium gluconate ( 0.45 mEq calcium $/ \mathrm{mL}$ ), and calcium chloride ( $0.68-1.36 \mathrm{mEq}$ calcium $/ \mathrm{mL}$ ) are available for intravenous therapy. Calcium gluconate is the preferred form because it is less irritating to veins. Oral preparations include calcium carbonate ( $40 \%$ calcium), calcium lactate ( $13 \%$ calcium), calcium phosphate ( $25 \%$ calcium), and calcium citrate ( $21 \%$ calcium). Calcium carbonate is often the preparation of choice because of its high percentage of calcium, ready availability (eg, Tums), low cost, and antacid properties. In achlorhydric patients, calcium carbonate should be given with meals to increase absorption or the patient switched to calcium citrate, which is somewhat better absorbed. Combinations of vitamin D and calcium are available, but treatment must be tailored to the individual patient and individual disease, a flexibility lost by fixed-dosage combinations. Treatment of severe symptomatic hypocalcemia can be accomplished with slow infusion of $5-20 \mathrm{~mL}$ of $10 \%$ calcium gluconate. Rapid infusion can lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Less severe hypocalcemia is best treated with oral forms sufficient to provide approximately $400-1200 \mathrm{mg}$ of elemental calcium (1-3 g calcium carbonate) per day. Dosage must be adjusted to avoid hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.

\section*{Vitamin D}

When rapidity of action is required, $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}_{3}$ (calcitriol), $0.25-1 \mathrm{mcg}$ daily, is the vitamin D metabolite of choice, because it is capable of raising serum calcium within $24-48$ hours. Calcitriol also raises serum phosphate, although this action is usually not observed early in treatment. The combined effects of calcitriol and all other vitamin D metabolites and analogs on both calcium and phosphate make careful monitoring of these mineral levels especially important to avoid ectopic calcification secondary to an abnormally high serum calcium x phosphate product. Since the choice of the appropriate vitamin D metabolite or analog for long-term treatment of hypocalcemia depends on the nature of the underlying disease, further discussion of vitamin D treatment is found under the headings of the specific diseases.

\section*{HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA}

Hyperphosphatemia is a common complication of renal failure but is also found in all types of hypoparathyroidism (idiopathic, surgical, and pseudo-), vitamin D intoxication, and the rare syndrome of tumoral calcinosis. Emergency treatment of hyperphosphatemia is seldom necessary but can be achieved by dialysis or glucose and insulin infusions. In general, control of hyperphosphatemia involves restriction of dietary phosphate plus the use of phosphate-binding gels such as sevelamer and of calcium supplements. Because of their potential to induce aluminum-associated bone disease, aluminum-containing antacids should be used sparingly and only when other measures fail to control the hyperphosphatemia.

\section*{HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA}

A variety of conditions are associated with hypophosphatemia, including primary hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, idiopathic hypercalciuria, vitamin D-resistant rickets, various other forms of renal phosphate wasting (eg, Fanconi's syndrome), overzealous use of phosphate binders, and parenteral nutrition with inadequate phosphate content. Acute hypophosphatemia may lead to a reduction in the intracellular levels of high-energy organic phosphates (eg, ATP), interfere with normal hemoglobin-totissue oxygen transfer by decreasing red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate levels, and lead to rhabdomyolysis. However, clinically significant acute effects of hypophosphatemia are seldom seen, and emergency treatment is generally not indicated. The long-term effects of hypophosphatemia include proximal muscle weakness and abnormal bone mineralization (osteomalacia). Therefore, hypophosphatemia should be avoided during other forms of therapy and treated in conditions such as hypophosphatemic rickets, of which it is a cardinal feature. Oral forms of phosphate available for use are listed above in the section on hypercalcemia.

\section*{Specific Disorders I nvolving the Bone Mineral-Regulating Hormones}

\section*{PRI MARY HYPERPARATHYROI DI SM}

This rather common disease, if associated with symptoms and significant hypercalcemia, is best treated surgically. Oral phosphate and bisphosphonates have been tried but cannot be recommended. Asymptomatic patients with mild disease in general do not get worse and may be left untreated. The calcimimetic agentcinacalcet, the first representative of a new class of drugs that act through the calcium sensing receptor, has been approved for secondary hyperparathyroidism and is in clinical trials for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism. If such drugs prove efficacious, medical management of this disease will need to be reconsidered.

\section*{HYPOPARATHYROI DISM}

In the absence of PTH (idiopathic or surgical hypoparathyroidism) or an abnormal target tissue response to PTH (pseudohypoparathyroidism), serum calcium falls and serum phosphate rises. In such patients, $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ levels are usually low, presumably reflecting the lack of stimulation by PTH of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ production. The skeletons of patients with idiopathic or surgical hypoparathyroidism are normal except for a slow turnover rate. A number of patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism appear to have osteitis fibrosa, suggesting that the normal or high PTH levels found in such patients are capable of acting on bone but not on the kidney. The distinction between pseudohypoparathyroidism and idiopathic hypoparathyroidism is made on the basis of normal or high PTH levels but deficient renal response (ie, diminished excretion of cAMP or phosphate) in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism.

The principal therapeutic concern is to restore normocalcemia and normophosphatemia. Under most circumstances, vitamin D (25,000-100,000 units three times per week) and dietary calcium supplements suffice. More rapid increments in serum calcium can be achieved with calcitriol, although it is not clear whether this metabolite offers a substantial advantage over vitamin D itself for long-term therapy. Many patients treated with vitamin D develop episodes of hypercalcemia. This complication is more rapidly reversible with cessation of therapy using calcitriol rather than vitamin D. This would be of importance to the patient in whom such hypercalcemic crises are common.

\section*{NUTRITIONAL VITAMI N D DEFI CI ENCY OR INSUFFI CI ENCY}

Vitamin D deficiency (generally defined as $25(\mathrm{OH}) \mathrm{D}$ levels $<10 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ ), once thought to be rare in this country, is being recognized more often, especially in the pediatric and geriatric populations on vegetarian diets and with reduced sunlight exposure. Vitamin D insufficiency, generally defined as 25 (OH)D levels between $10 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ and $32 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$, is very frequently found in most populations, and is associated with decreased bone mineral density and predisposition to falls and fractures in the elderly. This problem can be avoided by daily intake of 800-1200 units of vitamin D and treated by higher dosages ( 4000 units per day or 50,000 units per week for several weeks). No other metabolite is indicated. The diet should also contain adequate amounts of calcium and phosphate.

\section*{CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE}

The major problems of chronic kidney disease that impact on bone mineral homeostasis are the loss of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ production, the retention of phosphate that reduces ionized calcium levels, and the secondary hyperparathyroidism that results. With the loss of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ production, less calcium is absorbed from the intestine and less bone is resorbed under the influence of PTH. As a result hypocalcemia usually develops, furthering the development of hyperparathyroidism. The bones show a mixture of osteomalacia and osteitis fibrosa.

In contrast to the hypocalcemia that is more often associated with chronic kidney disease, some patients may become hypercalcemic from two causes (in addition to overzealous treatment with calcium). The most common cause of hypercalcemia is the development of severe secondary (sometimes referred to as tertiary) hyperparathyroidism. In such cases, the PTH level in blood is very high. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels also tend to be high. Treatment often requires parathyroidectomy.

A less common circumstance leading to hypercalcemia is development of a form of bone disease
characterized by a profound decrease in bone cell activity and loss of the calcium buffering action of bone (adynamic bone disease). In the absence of kidney function, any calcium absorbed from the intestine accumulates in the blood. Therefore, such patients are very sensitive to the hypercalcemic action of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$. These individuals generally have a high serum calcium but nearly normal alkaline phosphatase and PTH levels. The bone in such patients may have a high aluminum content, especially in the mineralization front, which blocks normal bone mineralization. These patients do not respond favorably to parathyroidectomy. Deferoxamine, an agent used to chelate iron (see Chapter 58), also binds aluminum and is being used as therapy for this disorder. However, with less use of aluminum-containing phosphate binders, most cases of adynamic bone disease are not associated with aluminum deposition but are attributed to overzealous suppression of PTH secretion.

\section*{Vitamin D Preparations}

The choice of vitamin D preparation to be used in the setting of chronic kidney disease depends on the type and extent of bone disease and hyperparathyroidism. Individuals with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency should first have their 25(OH)D levels restored to normal (above $32 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ ) with vitamin D. $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}_{3}$ (calcitriol) rapidly corrects hypocalcemia and at least partially reverses the secondary hyperparathyroidism and osteitis fibrosa. Many patients with muscle weakness and bone pain gain an improved sense of well-being.

Two analogs of calcitriol, doxercalciferol and paricalcitol, are approved for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism of chronic kidney disease. Their principal advantage is that they are less likely than calcitriol to induce hypercalcemia for any given reduction in PTH. Their greatest impact is in patients in whom the use of calcitriol may lead to unacceptably high serum calcium levels.

Regardless of the drug used, careful attention to serum calcium and phosphate levels is required. A calcium $\times$ phosphate product (in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ units) less than 55 is desired with both calcium and phosphate in the normal range. Calcium adjustments in the diet and dialysis bath and phosphate restriction (dietary and with oral ingestion of phosphate binders) should be used along with vitamin D metabolites. Monitoring serum PTH and alkaline phosphatase levels is useful in determining whether therapy is correcting or preventing secondary hyperparathyroidism. Although not generally available, percutaneous bone biopsies for quantitative histomorphometry may help in choosing appropriate therapy and following the effectiveness of such therapy, especially in cases suspected of having adynamic bone disease. Unlike the rapid changes in serum values, changes in bone morphology require months to years. Monitoring serum levels of the vitamin D metabolites is useful to determine compliance, absorption, and metabolism.

\section*{I NTESTI NAL OSTEODYSTROPHY}

A number of gastrointestinal and hepatic diseases result in disordered calcium and phosphate homeostasis that ultimately leads to bone disease. The bones in such patients show a combination of osteoporosis and osteomalacia. Osteitis fibrosa does not occur, as in renal osteodystrophy. The common features that appear to be important in this group of diseases are malabsorption of calcium and malabsorption of vitamin D. Liver disease may, in addition, reduce the production of 25(OH)D from vitamin D , although its importance in all but patients with terminal liver failure remains in dispute. The malabsorption of vitamin D is probably not limited to exogenous vitamin D . The liver secretes into bile a substantial number of vitamin D metabolites and conjugates that are reabsorbed in (presumably) the
distal jejunum and ileum. Interference with this process could deplete the body of endogenous vitamin D metabolites as well as limit absorption of dietary vitamin D.

In mild forms of malabsorption, vitamin D (25,000-50,000 units three times per week) should suffice to raise serum levels of 25(OH)D into the normal range. Many patients with severe disease do not respond to vitamin D. Clinical experience with the other metabolites is limited, but both calcitriol and calcifediol have been used successfully in doses similar to those recommended for treatment of renal osteodystrophy. Theoretically, calcifediol should be the drug of choice under these conditions, because no impairment of the renal metabolism of $25(\mathrm{OH}) \mathrm{D}$ to $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ and $24,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ exists in these patients. Both calcitriol and $24,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ may be of importance in reversing the bone disease. However, calcifediol is no longer available. As in the other diseases discussed, treatment of intestinal osteodystrophy with vitamin D and its metabolites should be accompanied by appropriate dietary calcium supplementation and monitoring of serum calcium and phosphate levels.

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS}

Osteoporosis is defined as abnormal loss of bone predisposing to fractures. It is most common in postmenopausal women but also occurs in men. The annual cost of fractures in older women and men in the USA was estimated at $\$ 13.8$ billion in 1996 and would be much higher today. It may occur as a side effect of long-term administration of glucocorticoids or other drugs; as a manifestation of endocrine disease such as thyrotoxicosis or hyperparathyroidism; as a feature of malabsorption syndrome; as a consequence of alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking; or without obvious cause (idiopathic). The ability of some agents to reverse the bone loss of osteoporosis is shown in Figure 42-5. The postmenopausal form of osteoporosis may be accompanied by lower $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ levels and reduced intestinal calcium transport. This form of osteoporosis is due to estrogen deficiency and can be treated with estrogen (cycled with a progestin in women with a uterus to prevent endometrial carcinoma). However, concern that estrogen increases the risk of breast cancer and fails to reduce the development of heart disease has reduced enthusiasm for this form of therapy.

Typical changes in bone mineral density with time after the onset of menopause, with and without treatment. In the untreated condition, bone is lost during aging in both men and women. Fluoride and PTH promote new bone formation and can increase bone mineral density in subjects who respond to it throughout the period of treatment. In contrast, estrogen, calcitonin, and bisphosphonates block bone resorption. This leads to a transient increase in bone mineral density because bone formation is not initially decreased. However, with time, both bone formation and bone resorption are decreased and bone mineral density reaches a new plateau.

As noted above, estrogen-like SERMs (selective estrogen receptor modulators, Chapter 40) have been developed that prevent the increased risk of breast and uterine cancer associated with estrogen while maintaining the benefit to bone. Raloxifene is such a drug approved for treatment of osteoporosis. Like tamoxifen, it appears to reduce the risk of breast cancer. Raloxifene protects against spine fractures but not hip fractures-unlike bisphosphonates and teriparatide, which protect against both. Raloxifene does not prevent hot flushes and imposes the same increased risk of thrombophlebitis as estrogen. To counter the reduced intestinal calcium transport associated with osteoporosis, vitamin D therapy is often used in addition to dietary calcium supplementation. There is no clear evidence that pharmacologic doses of vitamin D are of much additional benefit beyond cyclic estrogens and calcium supplementation. However, in several large studies, vitamin D supplementation ( $800 \mathrm{IU} / \mathrm{d}$ ) has been shown to be useful. In addition, calcitriol and its analog $1 \mathrm{~F}(\mathrm{OH}) \mathrm{D}_{3}$ have been shown to increase bone mass and reduce fractures in several recent studies. Use of these agents for osteoporosis is not FDAapproved, although they are used in other countries.

Despite early promise that fluoride might be useful in the prevention or treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, this form of therapy remains controversial. A new formulation of fluoride (slow release, lower dose) appears to avoid much of the toxicity of earlier formulations and may reduce fracture rates. However, this formulation has not been approved by the FDA. Teriparatide, the recombinant form of PTH 1-34, has recently been approved for treatment of osteoporosis. Teriparatide is given in a dosage of 20 mcg subcutaneously daily. Like fluoride, teriparatide stimulates new bone formation, but unlike fluoride, this new bone appears structurally normal and is associated with a substantial reduction in the incidence of fractures.

Calcitonin is approved for use in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. It has been shown to
increase bone mass and reduce fractures, but only in the spine. It does not appear to be as effective as bisphosphonates or teriparatide.

Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of bone resorption. They increase bone density and reduce the risk of fractures in the hip, spine, and other locations. Alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate are approved for the treatment of osteoporosis, using either daily dosing schedules: alendronate 10 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, risedronate $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, ibandronate $2.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$; weekly schedules: alendronate $70 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{wk}$, risedronate $35 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{wk}$; or monthly schedules: ibandronate $150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mo}$. These drugs are effective in men as well as women and for various causes of osteoporosis.

\section*{X-LI NKED \& AUTOSOMAL DOMI NANT HYPOPHOSPHATEMI A}

These disorders are manifested by the appearance of rickets and hypophosphatemia in children, although they may first present in adults. X-linked hypophosphatemia is caused by mutations in a gene encoding a protein called PHEX, which appears to be an endopeptidase. Mutations in the gene responsible for the autosomal dominant form target FGF23. The current concept is that FGF23 blocks the renal uptake of phosphate and blocks $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}_{3}$ production. Mutations in PHEX inactivate it, and FGF23 levels increase. Similarly, mutations in FGF23 that resist hydrolysis, as seen in patients with the autosomal form of hypophosphatemic rickets, also have elevated FGF23 levels.

Initially, it was thought that FGF23 was a direct substrate for PHEX, but this no longer appears to be the case. In either disease, intact and biologically active FGF23 accumulates, leading to phosphate wasting in the urine and hypophosphatemia.

Phosphate is critical to normal bone mineralization; when phosphate stores are deficient, a clinical and pathologic picture resembling vitamin D-deficient rickets develops. However, such children fail to respond to the usual doses of vitamin D used in the treatment of nutritional rickets. A defect in $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ production by the kidney has also been noted, because the serum $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ levels tend to be low in comparison with the degree of hypophosphatemia observed. This combination of low serum phosphate and low or low-normal serum $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ provides the rationale for treating such patients with oral phosphate ( $1-3 \mathrm{~g}$ daily) and calcitriol ( $0.25-2 \mathrm{mcg}$ daily). Reports of such combination therapy are encouraging in this otherwise debilitating disease.

\section*{VITAMIN D- DEPENDENT RI CKETS TYPES I \& II}

These distinctly different autosomal recessive diseases present as childhood rickets that does not respond to conventional doses of vitamin D. Type I vitamin D-dependent rickets, now known as pseudovitamin D deficiency rickets, is due to an isolated deficiency of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ production caused by mutations in $25(\mathrm{OH}) \mathrm{D}-1 \mathrm{c}$-hydroxylase. This condition can be treated with vitamin D ( 4000 units daily) or calcitriol ( $0.25-0.5 \mathrm{mcg}$ daily). Type II vitamin D-dependent rickets, now known as hereditary vitamin D resistant rickets, is caused by mutations in the gene for the vitamin D receptor, which disrupt the functions of this receptor and lead to this syndrome. The serum levels of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ are very high in type II but not in type I vitamin D-dependent rickets. Treatment with large doses of calcitriol has been claimed to be effective in restoring normocalcemia in some patients, presumably those with a partially functional vitamin D receptor. Some patients are totally refractory to vitamin D. One recent report indicates a reversal of resistance to calcitriol when $24,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ was given. These diseases are rare.

\section*{NEPHROTIC SYNDROME}

Patients with nephrotic syndrome can lose vitamin D metabolites in the urine, presumably by loss of the vitamin D-binding protein. Such patients may have very low 25(OH)D levels. Some of them develop bone disease. It is not yet clear what value vitamin $D$ therapy has in such patients, because therapeutic trials with vitamin D (or any other vitamin D metabolite) have not yet been carried out. Because the problem is not related to vitamin D metabolism, one would not anticipate any advantage in using the more expensive vitamin D metabolites in place of vitamin D itself.

\section*{I DI OPATHI C HYPERCALCI URIA}

People with idiopathic hypercalciuria, characterized by hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis with normal serum calcium and PTH levels, have been subdivided into three groups: (1) hyperabsorbers, patients with increased intestinal absorption of calcium, resulting in high-normal serum calcium, low-normal PTH, and a secondary increase in urine calcium; (2) renal calcium leakers, patients with a primary decrease in renal reabsorption of filtered calcium, leading to low-normal serum calcium and highnormal serum PTH; and (3) renal phosphate leakers, patients with a primary decrease in renal reabsorption of phosphate, leading to stimulation of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ production, increased intestinal calcium absorption, increased ionized serum calcium, low-normal PTH levels, and a secondary increase in urine calcium. There is some disagreement about this classification, and many patients are not readily categorized. Many such patients present with mild hypophosphatemia, and oral phosphate has been used with some success to reduce stone formation. However, a clear role for phosphate in the treatment of this disorder has not been established.

Therapy with hydrochlorothiazide, up to 50 mg twice daily, or chlorthalidone, $50-100 \mathrm{mg}$ daily, is recommended. Loop diuretics such as furosemide and ethacrynic acid should not be used because they increase urinary calcium excretion. The major toxicity of thiazide diuretics, besides hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperglycemia, is hypercalcemia. This is seldom more than a biochemical observation unless the patient has a disease such as hyperparathyroidism in which bone turnover is accelerated. Accordingly, one should screen patients for such disorders before starting thiazide therapy and monitor serum and urine calcium when therapy has begun.

An alternative to thiazides is allopurinol. Some studies indicate that hyperuricosuria is associated with idiopathic hypercalcemia and that a small nidus of urate crystals could lead to the calcium oxalate stone formation characteristic of idiopathic hypercalcemia. Allopurinol, 300 mg daily, may reduce stone formation by reducing uric acid excretion.

\section*{Other Disorders of Bone Mineral Homeostasis PAGET'S DISEASE OF BONE}

Paget's disease is a localized bone disease characterized by uncontrolled osteoclastic bone resorption with secondary increases in bone formation. This new bone is poorly organized, however. The cause of Paget's disease is obscure, although some studies suggest that a slow virus may be involved. The disease is fairly common, although symptomatic bone disease is less common. The biochemical parameters of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline are useful for diagnosis. Along with the characteristic radiologic and bone scan findings, these biochemical determinations provide good markers by which to follow therapy.

The goal of treatment is to reduce bone pain and stabilize or prevent other problems such as progressive deformity, hearing loss, high-output cardiac failure, and immobilization hypercalcemia. Calcitonin and bisphosphonates are the first-line agents for this disease. Treatment failures may respond to plicamycin. Calcitonin is administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly in doses of 50-100 MRC units every day or every other day. Nasal inhalation at 200-400 units per day is also effective. Higher or more frequent doses have been advocated when this initial regimen is ineffective. Improvement in bone pain and reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase and urine hydroxyproline levels require weeks to months. Often a patient who responds well initially loses the response to calcitonin. This refractoriness is not correlated with the development of antibodies.

Sodium etidronate, alendronate, risedronate, and tiludronate are the bisphosphonates currently approved for clinical use in this condition in the USA. However, other bisphosphonates, including pamidronate, are being used in other countries. The recommended dosages of bisphosphonates are etidronate, $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$; alendronate, $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$; risedronate, $30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$; and tiludronate, $400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. Longterm (months to years) remission may be expected in patients who respond to these agents. Treatment should not exceed 6 months per course but can be repeated after 6 months if necessary. The principal toxicity of etidronate is the development of osteomalacia and an increased incidence of fractures when the dosage is raised substantially above $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. The newer bisphosphonates such as risedronate and alendronate do not share this side effect. Some patients treated with etidronate develop bone pain similar in nature to the bone pain of osteomalacia. This subsides after stopping the drug. The principal side effect of alendronate and the newer bisphosphonates is gastric irritation when used at these high doses. This is reversible on cessation of the drug.

The use of a potentially lethal cytotoxic drug such as plicamycin in a generally benign disorder such as Paget's disease is recommended only when other less toxic agents (calcitonin, alendronate) have failed and the symptoms are debilitating. Insufficient clinical data on long-term use of plicamycin are available to determine its usefulness for extended therapy. However, short courses involving 15-25 $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ intravenously for $5-10$ days followed by $15 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg}$ intravenously each week have been used to control the disease.

\section*{ENTERI C OXALURI A}

Patients with short bowel syndromes associated with fat malabsorption can present with renal stones composed of calcium and oxalate. Such patients characteristically have normal or low urine calcium levels but elevated urine oxalate levels. The reasons for the development of oxaluria in such patients are thought to be twofold: first, in the intestinal lumen, calcium (which is now bound to fat) fails to bind oxalate and no longer prevents its absorption; second, enteric flora, acting on the increased supply of nutrients reaching the colon, produce larger amounts of oxalate. Although one would ordinarily avoid treating a patient with calcium oxalate stones with calcium supplementation, this is precisely what is done in patients with enteric oxaluria. The increased intestinal calcium binds the excess oxalate and prevents its absorption. One to 2 g of calcium carbonate can be given daily in divided doses, with careful monitoring of urinary calcium and oxalate to be certain that urinary oxalate falls without a dangerous increase in urinary calcium.

\section*{BETA-LACTAM COMPOUNDS PENI CI LLI NS}

The penicillins share features of chemistry, mechanism of action, pharmacology, and immunologic characteristics with cephalosporins, monobactams, carbapenems, and B-lactamase inhibitors. All are Blactam compounds, so named because of their unique four-membered lactam ring.

\section*{Chemistry}

All penicillins have the basic structure shown in Figure 43-1. A thiazolidine ring (A) is attached to a B-lactam ring (B) that carries a secondary amino group (RNH-). Substituents (R; examples shown in Figure 43-2) can be attached to the amino group. Structural integrity of the 6 -aminopenicillanic acid nucleus is essential for the biologic activity of these compounds. Hydrolysis of the B-lactam ring by bacterial B-lactamases yields penicilloic acid, which lacks antibacterial activity.
Figure 43-1.

Core structures of four B-lactam antibiotic families. The ring marked B in each structure is the B-lactam ring. The penicillins are susceptible to bacterial metabolism and inactivation by amidases and lactamases at the points shown. Note that the carbapenems have a different stereochemical configuration in the lactam ring that apparently imparts resistance to $B$-lactamases. Substituents for the penicillin and cephalosporin families are shown in Figures 43-2 and 43-6, respectively.

\section*{\section*{CLASSI FI CATI ON}}

Substituents of the 6-aminopenicillanic acid moiety determine the essential pharmacologic and antibacterial properties of the resulting molecules. Penicillins can be assigned to one of three groups (below). Within each
of these groups are compounds that are relatively stable to gastric acid and suitable for oral administration, eg, penicillin V, dicloxacillin, and amoxicillin. The side chains of some representatives of each group are shown in Figure 43-2, with a few distinguishing characteristics.

\section*{Penicillins (eg, Penicillin G)}

These have greatest activity against gram-positive organisms, gram-negative cocci, and non-B-lactamaseproducing anaerobes. However, they have little activity against gram-negative rods, and they are susceptible to hydrolysis by B-lactamases.

\section*{Antistaphylococcal Penicillins (eg, Nafcillin)}

These penicillins are resistant to staphylococcal B-lactamases. They are active against staphylococci and streptococci but not against enterococci, anaerobic bacteria, and gram-negative cocci and rods.

\section*{Extended-Spectrum Penicillins (Ampicillin and the Antipseudomonal Penicillins)}

These drugs retain the antibacterial spectrum of penicillin and have improved activity against gram-negative organisms. Like penicillin, however, they are relatively susceptible to hydrolysis by B-lactamases.

\section*{PENICILLIN UNITS AND FORMULATIONS}

The activity of penicillin G was originally defined in units. Crystalline sodium penicillin G contains approximately 1600 units per mg ( 1 unit $=0.6 \mathrm{mcg}$; 1 million units of penicillin $=0.6 \mathrm{~g}$ ). Semisynthetic penicillins are prescribed by weight rather than units. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of any penicillin (or other antimicrobial) is usually given in $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Most penicillins are dispensed as the sodium or potassium salt of the free acid. Potassium penicillin G contains about 1.7 mEq of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$per million units of penicillin ( $2.8 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{g}$ ). Nafcillin contains $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, 2.8 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{g}$. Procaine salts and benzathine salts of penicillin G provide repository forms for intramuscular injection. In dry crystalline form, penicillin salts are stable for years at $4{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Solutions lose their activity rapidly (eg, 24 hours at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) and must be prepared fresh for administration.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Penicillins, like all B-lactam antibiotics, inhibit bacterial growth by interfering with the transpeptidation reaction of bacterial cell wall synthesis. The cell wall is a rigid outer layer unique to bacterial species. It completely surrounds the cytoplasmic membrane (Figure 43-3), maintains cell shape and integrity, and prevents cell lysis from high osmotic pressure. The cell wall is composed of a complex cross-linked polymer of polysaccharides and polypeptides, peptidoglycan (murein, mucopeptide). The polysaccharide contains alternating amino sugars, N -acetylglucosamine and N -acetylmuramic acid (Figure 43-4). A five-amino-acid peptide is linked to the N -acetylmuramic acid sugar. This peptide terminates in D -alanyl- D -alanine. Penicillin-binding protein (PBP, an enzyme) removes the terminal alanine in the process of forming a crosslink with a nearby peptide. Cross-links give the cell wall its structural rigidity. B-Lactam antibiotics, structural analogs of the natural D -Ala- D -Ala substrate, covalently bind to the active site of PBPs. This inhibits the transpeptidation reaction (Figure 43-5), halting peptidoglycan synthesis, and the cell dies. The exact mechanism of cell death is not completely understood, but autolysins and disruption of cell wall morphogenesis are involved. Penicillins and cephalosporins kill bacterial cells only when they are actively growing and synthesizing cell wall.

A highly simplified diagram of the cell envelope of a gram-negative bacterium. The outer membrane, a lipid bilayer, is present in gram-negative but not gram-positive organisms. It is penetrated by porins, proteins that form channels providing hydrophilic access to the cytoplasmic membrane. The peptidoglycan layer is unique to bacteria and is much thicker in gram-positive organisms than in gram-negative ones. Together, the outer membrane and the peptidoglycan layer constitute the cell wall. Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are membrane proteins that cross-link peptidoglycan. BLactamases, if present, reside in the periplasmic space or on the outer surface of the cytoplasmic membrane, where they may destroy B-lactam antibiotics that penetrate the outer membrane.

The transpeptidation reaction in Staphylococcus aureus that is inhibited by B-lactam antibiotics. The cell wall of grampositive bacteria is made up of long peptidoglycan polymer chains consisting of the alternating aminohexoses N acetylglucosamine (G) and N-acetylmuramic acid (M) with pentapeptide side chains linked (in S aureus) by pentaglycine
bridges. The exact composition of the side chains varies among species. The diagram illustrates small segments of two such polymer chains and their amino acid side chains. These linear polymers must be cross-linked by transpeptidation of the side chains at the points indicated by the asterisk to achieve the strength necessary for cell viability.

\section*{Resistance}

Resistance to penicillins and other $B$-lactams is due to one of four general mechanisms: (1) inactivation of antibiotic by B-lactamase, (2) modification of target PBPs, (3) impaired penetration of drug to target PBPs, and (4) efflux. B-Lactamase production is the most common mechanism of resistance. Many hundreds of different $B$-lactamases have been identified. Some, such as those produced by Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus sp, and Escherichia coli, are relatively narrow in substrate specificity, preferring penicillins to cephalosporins. Other B-lactamases, eg, AmpC B-lactamase produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter sp, and extended-spectrum B-lactamases (ESBLs), hydrolyze both cephalosporins and penicillins. Carbapenems are highly resistant to hydrolysis by penicillinases and cephalosporinases but they are hydrolyzed by metallo-B-lactamase and carbapenemases.

Altered target PBPs are the basis of methicillin resistance in staphylococci and of penicillin resistance in pneumococci and enterococci. These resistant organisms produce PBPs that have low affinity for binding Blactam antibiotics, and consequently they are not inhibited except at relatively high, often clinically unachievable, drug concentrations.

Resistance due to impaired penetration of antibiotic to target PBPs occurs only in gram-negative species because of their impermeable outer cell wall membrane, which is absent in gram-positive bacteria. B-Lactam antibiotics cross the outer membrane and enter gram-negative organisms via outer membrane protein channels (porins). Absence of the proper channel or down-regulation of its production can greatly impair drug entry into the cell. Poor penetration alone is usually not sufficient to confer resistance, because enough antibiotic eventually enters the cell to inhibit growth. However, this barrier can become important in the presence of a B-lactamase, even a relatively inactive one, as long as it can hydrolyze drug faster than it enters the cell. Gram-negative organisms also may produce an efflux pump, which consists of cytoplasmic and periplasmic protein components that efficiently transport some B-lactam antibiotics from the periplasm back across the outer membrane.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Absorption of orally administered drug differs greatly for different penicillins, depending in part on their acid stability and protein binding. Gastrointestinal absorption of nafcillin is erratic, so it is not suitable for oral administration. Dicloxacillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin are acid-stable and relatively well absorbed, producing serum concentrations in the range of $4-8 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ following a 500 mg oral dose. Absorption of most oral penicillins (amoxicillin being an exception) is impaired by food, and the drugs should be administered at least 1-2 hours before or after a meal.

After parenteral administration, absorption of most penicillins is complete and rapid. Intravenous administration is preferred to the intramuscular route because of irritation and local pain from intramuscular injection of large doses. Serum concentrations 30 minutes after an intravenous injection of 1 g of a penicillin (equivalent to approximately 1.6 million units of penicillin G) are $20-50 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Only a small amount of the total drug in serum is present as free drug, the concentration of which is determined by protein binding. Highly protein-bound penicillins (eg, nafcillin) generally achieve lower free-drug concentrations in serum than less protein-bound penicillins (eg, penicillin G, ampicillin). Protein binding becomes clinically relevant when the protein-bound percentage is approximately $95 \%$ or more. Penicillins are widely distributed in body fluids and tissues with a few exceptions. They are polar molecules, so intracellular concentrations are well below those found in extracellular fluids.

Benzathine and procaine penicillins are formulated to delay absorption, resulting in prolonged blood and tissue concentrations. A single intramuscular injection of 1.2 million units of benzathine penicillin maintains serum levels above $0.02 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ for 10 days, sufficient to treat $B$-hemolytic streptococcal infection. After 3 weeks, levels still exceed $0.003 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$, which is enough to prevent B-hemolytic streptococcal infection. A 600,000 unit dose of procaine penicillin yields peak concentrations of $1-2 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ and clinically useful concentrations for 12-24 hours after a single intramuscular injection.

Penicillin concentrations in most tissues are equal to those in serum. Penicillin is also excreted into sputum and milk to levels $3-15 \%$ of those present in the serum. Penetration into the eye, the prostate, and the central nervous system is poor. However, with active inflammation of the meninges, as in bacterial meningitis, penicillin concentrations of $1-5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ can be achieved with a daily parenteral dose of 18-24 million units. These concentrations are sufficient to kill susceptible strains of pneumococci and meningococci.

Penicillin is rapidly excreted by the kidneys; small amounts are excreted by other routes. About $10 \%$ of renal excretion is by glomerular filtration and $90 \%$ by tubular secretion. The normal half-life of penicillin G is approximately 30 minutes; in renal failure, it may be as long as 10 hours. Ampicillin and the extendedspectrum penicillins are secreted more slowly than penicillin $G$ and have half-lives of 1 hour. For penicillins that are cleared by the kidney, the dose must be adjusted according to renal function, with approximately one fourth to one third the normal dose being administered if creatinine clearance is $10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ or less (Table 43-1).

Nafcillin is primarily cleared by biliary excretion. Oxacillin, dicloxacillin, and cloxacillin are eliminated by both the kidney and biliary excretion; no dosage adjustment is required for these drugs in renal failure. Because
clearance of penicillins is less efficient in the newborn, doses adjusted for weight alone result in higher systemic concentrations for longer periods than in the adult.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Except for oral amoxicillin, penicillins should be given 1-2 hours before or after a meal; they should not be given with food to minimize binding to food proteins and acid inactivation. Blood levels of all penicillins can be raised by simultaneous administration of probenecid, 0.5 g ( $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ in children) every 6 hours orally, which impairs renal tubular secretion of weak acids such as B-lactam compounds.

\section*{PENICILLIN}

Penicillin G is a drug of choice for infections caused by streptococci, meningococci, enterococci, penicillinsusceptible pneumococci, non-B-lactamase-producing staphylococci, Treponema pallidum and many other spirochetes, clostridium species, actinomyces, and other gram-positive rods and non-B-lactamase-producing gram-negative anaerobic organisms. Depending on the organism, the site, and the severity of infection, effective doses range between 4 and 24 million units per day administered intravenously in four to six divided doses. High-dose penicillin G can also be given as a continuous intravenous infusion.

Penicillin V, the oral form of penicillin, is indicated only in minor infections because of its relatively poor bioavailability, the need for dosing four times a day, and its narrow antibacterial spectrum. Amoxicillin (see below) is often used instead.

Benzathine penicillin and procaine penicillin G for intramuscular injection yield low but prolonged drug levels. A single intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin, 1.2 million units, is effective treatment for Bhemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis; given intramuscularly once every 3-4 weeks, it prevents reinfection. Benzathine penicillin G, 2.4 million units intramuscularly once a week for 1-3 weeks, is effective in the treatment of syphilis. Procaine penicillin G, formerly a work horse for treating uncomplicated pneumococcal pneumonia or gonorrhea, is rarely used nowadays because many strains are penicillin-resistant.

\section*{PENICILLINS RESI STANT TO STAPHYLOCOCCAL BETA-LACTAMASE (METHICILLIN, NAFCILLIN, AND ISOXAZOLYL PENICILLINS)}

These semisynthetic penicillins are indicated for infection by B-lactamase-producing staphylococci, although penicillin-susceptible strains of streptococci and pneumococci are also susceptible. Listeria, enterococci, and methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci are resistant.

An isoxazolyl penicillin such as oxacillin, cloxacillin, or dicloxacillin, $0.25-0.5 \mathrm{~g}$ orally every $4-6$ hours (15-25 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ for children), is suitable for treatment of mild to moderate localized staphylococcal infections. All are relatively acid-stable and have reasonable bioavailability. However, food interferes with absorption, and the drugs should be administered 1 hour before or after meals.

For serious systemic staphylococcal infections, oxacillin or nafcillin, $8-12 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$, is given by intermittent intravenous infusion of 1-2 g every 4-6 hours ( $50-100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ for children).

\section*{EXTENDED-SPECTRUM PENICILLINS (AMINOPENICILLINS, CARBOXYPENICILLINS, AND UREI DOPENI CI LLI NS)}

These drugs have greater activity than penicillin against gram-negative bacteria because of their enhanced ability to penetrate the gram-negative outer membrane. Like penicillin $G$, they are inactivated by many $B$ lactamases.

The aminopenicillins, ampicillin and amoxicillin, have identical spectrum and activity, but amoxicillin is better
absorbed orally. Amoxicillin, $250-500 \mathrm{mg}$ three times daily, is equivalent to the same amount of ampicillin given four times daily. These drugs are given orally to treat urinary tract infections, sinusitis, otitis, and lower respiratory tract infections. Ampicillin and amoxicillin are the most active of the oral B-lactam antibiotics against penicillin-resistant pneumococci and are the preferred $B$-lactam antibiotics for treating infections suspected to be caused by these resistant strains. Ampicillin (but not amoxicillin) is effective for shigellosis. Its use to treat uncomplicated salmonella gastroenteritis is controversial because it may prolong the carrier state.

Ampicillin, at dosages of $4-12 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ intravenously, is useful for treating serious infections caused by penicillinsusceptible organisms, including anaerobes, enterococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and B-lactamase-negative strains of gram-negative cocci and bacilli such as E coli, and salmonella species. Non-B-lactamase-producing strains of H influenzae are generally susceptible, but strains that are resistant because of altered PBPs are emerging. Many gram-negative species produce $B$-lactamases and are resistant, precluding use of ampicillin for empirical therapy of urinary tract infections, meningitis, and typhoid fever. Ampicillin is not active against klebsiella, enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter, serratia, indole-positive proteus species, and other gram-negative aerobes that are commonly encountered in hospital-acquired infections.

Carbenicillin, the very first antipseudomonal carboxypenicillin, is obsolete. A derivative, carbenicillin indanyl sodium, can be given orally for urinary tract infections. There are more active, better tolerated alternatives. A carboxypenicillin with activity similar to that of carbenicillin is ticarcillin. It is less active than ampicillin against enterococci. The ureidopenicillins, piperacillin, mezlocillin, and azlocillin, are also active against selected gram-negative bacilli, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae. Although supportive clinical data are lacking for superiority of combination therapy over single-drug therapy, because of the propensity of P aeruginosa to develop resistance, an antipseudomonal penicillin is frequently used in combination with an aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone for pseudomonal infections outside the urinary tract.

Ampicillin, amoxicillin, ticarcillin, and piperacillin are also available in combination with one of several $\beta$ lactamase inhibitors: clavulanic acid, sulbactam, or tazobactam. The addition of a B-lactamase inhibitor extends the activity of these penicillins to include $B$-lactamase-producing strains of $S$ aureus as well as some B-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria (see below).

\section*{Adverse Reactions}

The penicillins are remarkably nontoxic. Most of the serious adverse effects are due to hypersensitivity. All penicillins are cross-sensitizing and cross-reacting. The antigenic determinants are degradation products of penicillins, particularly penicilloic acid and products of alkaline hydrolysis bound to host protein. A history of a penicillin reaction is not reliable; about $5-8 \%$ of people claim such a history, but only a small number of these will have an allergic reaction when given penicillin. Less than $1 \%$ of persons who previously received penicillin without incident will have an allergic reaction when given penicillin. Because of the potential for anaphylaxis, however, penicillin should be administered with caution or a substitute drug given if there is a history of penicillin allergy. The incidence of allergic reactions in small children is negligible.

Allergic reactions include anaphylactic shock (very rare-0.05\% of recipients); serum sickness-type reactions (now rare-urticaria, fever, joint swelling, angioneurotic edema, intense pruritus, and respiratory embarrassment occurring 7-12 days after exposure); and a variety of skin rashes. Oral lesions, fever, interstitial nephritis (an autoimmune reaction to a penicillin-protein complex), eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia and other hematologic disturbances, and vasculitis may also occur. Most patients allergic to penicillins can be
treated with alternative drugs. However, if necessary (eg, treatment of enterococcal endocarditis or neurosyphilis in a highly penicillin-allergic patient), desensitization can be accomplished with gradually increasing doses of penicillin.

In patients with renal failure, penicillin in high doses can cause seizures. Nafcillin is associated with neutropenia; oxacillin can cause hepatitis; and methicillin causes interstitial nephritis (and is no longer used for this reason). Large doses of penicillins given orally may lead to gastrointestinal upset, particularly nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Ampicillin has been associated with pseudomembranous colitis. Secondary infections such as vaginal candidiasis may occur. Ampicillin and amoxicillin can cause skin rashes that are not allergic in nature.

\section*{CEPHALOSPORINS \& CEPHAMYCI NS}

Cephalosporins are similar to penicillins, but more stable to many bacterial B-lactamases and therefore have a broader spectrum of activity. However, strains of E coli and Klebsiella species expressing extendedspectrum B-lactamases that can hydrolyze most cephalosporins are becoming a problem. Cephalosporins are not active against enterococci and L monocytogenes.

\section*{Chemistry}

The nucleus of the cephalosporins, 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (Figure 43-6), bears a close resemblance to 6-aminopenicillanic acid (Figure 43-1). The intrinsic antimicrobial activity of natural cephalosporins is low, but the attachment of various $\mathrm{R}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{R}_{2}$ groups has yielded hundreds of potent compounds of low toxicity (Figure 43-6). Cephalosporins can be classified into four major groups or generations, depending mainly on the spectrum of antimicrobial activity.

\section*{FI RST-GENERATI ON CEPHALOSPORI NS}

First-generation cephalosporins include cefadroxil, cefazolin, cephalexin, cephalothin, cephapirin, and cephradine. These drugs are very active against gram-positive cocci, such as pneumococci, streptococci, and staphylococci. Cephalosporins are not active against methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. E coli, K pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis are often sensitive, but activity against P aeruginosa, indole-positive proteus, enterobacter, Serratia marcescens, citrobacter, and acinetobacter is poor. Anaerobic cocci (eg,
peptococcus, peptostreptococcus) are usually sensitive, but Bacteroides fragilis is not.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

\section*{ORAL}

Cephalexin, cephradine, and cefadroxil are absorbed from the gut to a variable extent. After oral doses of 500 mg , serum levels are $15-20 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Urine concentration is usually very high, but in most tissues levels are variable and generally lower than in serum. Cephalexin and cephradine are given orally in dosages of $0.25-0.5 \mathrm{~g}$ four times daily ( $15-30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) and cefadroxil in dosages of $0.5-1 \mathrm{~g}$ twice daily. Excretion is mainly by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion into the urine. Drugs that block tubular secretion, eg, probenecid, may increase serum levels substantially. In patients with impaired renal function, dosage must be reduced (Table 43-2).

\section*{PARENTERAL}

Cefazolin is the only first-generation parenteral cephalosporin still in general use. After an intravenous infusion of 1 g , the peak level of cefazolin is $90-120 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. The usual intravenous dosage of cefazolin for adults is 0.5-2 g intravenously every 8 hours. Cefazolin can also be administered intramuscularly. Excretion is via the kidney, and dose adjustments must be made for impaired renal function.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Although the first-generation cephalosporins are broad spectrum and relatively nontoxic, they are rarely the drug of choice for any infection. Oral drugs may be used for the treatment of urinary tract infections, for staphylococcal, or for streptococcal infections including cellulitis or soft tissue abscess. However, oral cephalosporins should not be relied on in serious systemic infections.

Cefazolin penetrates well into most tissues. It is a drug of choice for surgical prophylaxis. Cefazolin may be a choice in infections for which it is the least toxic drug (eg, K pneumoniae ) and in persons with staphylococcal or streptococcal infections who have a history of penicillin allergy other than immediate hypersensitivity. Cefazolin does not penetrate the central nervous system and cannot be used to treat meningitis. Cefazolin is an alternative to an antistaphylococcal penicillin for patients who are allergic to penicillin.

\section*{SECOND-GENERATION CEPHALOSPORINS}

Members of the second-generation cephalosporins include cefaclor, cefamandole, cefonicid, cefuroxime, cefprozil, loracarbef, and ceforanide and the structurally related cephamycins cefoxitin, cefmetazole, and cefotetan, which have activity against anaerobes. This is a heterogeneous group of drugs with marked individual differences in activity, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity. In general, they are active against organisms inhibited by first-generation drugs, but in addition they have extended gram-negative coverage. Klebsiellae (including those resistant to cephalothin) are usually sensitive. Cefamandole, cefuroxime, cefonicid, ceforanide, and cefaclor are active against H influenzae but not against serratia or B fragilis. In contrast, cefoxitin, cefmetazole, and cefotetan are active against B fragilis and some serratia strains but are less active against H influenzae. As with first-generation agents, none is active against enterococci or P aeruginosa. Second-generation cephalosporins may exhibit in vitro activity against enterobacter species, but resistant mutants that constitutively express a chromosomal B-lactamase that hydrolyzes these compounds (and thirdgeneration cephalosporins) are readily selected, and they should not be used to treat enterobacter infections.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

\section*{ORAL}

Cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefprozil, and loracarbef can be given orally. The usual dosage for adults is 10-15 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in two to four divided doses; children should be given $20-40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ up to a maximum of $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$. Except for cefuroxime axetil, these drugs are not predictably active against penicillin-resistant pneumococci and should be used cautiously, if at all, to treat suspected or proved pneumococcal infections. Cefaclor is more susceptible to B-lactamase hydrolysis compared with the other agents, and its usefulness is correspondingly diminished.

\section*{PARENTERAL}

After a 1-g intravenous infusion, serum levels are $75-125 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ for most second-generation cephalosporins. Intramuscular administration is painful and should be avoided. Doses and dosing intervals vary depending on the specific agent (Table 43-2). There are marked differences in half-life, protein binding, and interval between doses. All are renally cleared and require dosage adjustment in renal failure.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

The oral second-generation cephalosporins are active against B-lactamase-producing H influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis and have been primarily used to treat sinusitis, otitis, or lower respiratory tract infections, in which these organisms have an important role. Because of their activity against anaerobes
(including B fragilis ), cefoxitin, cefotetan, or cefmetazole can be used to treat mixed anaerobic infections such as peritonitis or diverticulitis. Cefuroxime is used to treat community-acquired pneumonia because it is active against B -lactamase-producing H influenzae or K pneumoniae and penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Although cefuroxime crosses the blood-brain barrier, it is less effective in treatment of meningitis than ceftriaxone or cefotaxime and should not be used.

\section*{THI RD-GENERATION CEPHALOSPORI NS}

Third-generation agents include cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, cefixime, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefdinir, cefditoren pivoxil, ceftibuten, and moxalactam.

\section*{Antimicrobial Activity}

Compared with second-generation agents, these drugs have expanded gram-negative coverage, and some are able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Third-generation drugs are active against citrobacter, S marcescens, and providencia (though resistance can emerge during treatment of infections caused by these species due to selection of mutants that constitutively produce cephalosporinase). They are also effective against $B$-lactamase-producing strains of haemophilus and neisseria. Ceftazidime and cefoperazone are the only two drugs with useful activity against $P$ aeruginosa. Like the second-generation drugs, third-generation cephalosporins are hydrolyzable by constitutively produced AmpC B-lactamase, and they are not reliably active against enterobacter species. Serratia, providencia, and citrobacter also produce a chromosomally encoded cephalosporinase that, when constitutively expressed, can confer resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. Ceftizoxime and moxalactam are active against B fragilis. Cefixime, cefdinir, ceftibuten, and cefpodoxime proxetil are oral agents possessing similar activity except that cefixime and ceftibuten are much less active against pneumococci (and completely inactive against penicillin-resistant strains) and have poor activity against S aureus.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

Intravenous infusion of 1 g of a parenteral cephalosporin produces serum levels of $60-140 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Cephalosporins penetrate body fluids and tissues well and, with the exception of cefoperazone and all oral cephalosorins, achieve levels in the cerebrospinal fluid sufficient to inhibit most pathogens, including gramnegative rods, except pseudomonas.

The half-lives of these drugs and the necessary dosing intervals vary greatly: Ceftriaxone (half-life 7-8 hours) can be injected once every 24 hours at a dosage of $15-50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. A single daily $1-\mathrm{g}$ dose is sufficient for most serious infections, with 4 g once daily recommended for treatment of meningitis. Cefoperazone (half-life 2 hours) can be injected every $8-12$ hours in a dosage of $25-100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. The remaining drugs in the group (half-life 1-1.7 hours) can be injected every 6-8 hours in dosages between 2 and $12 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$, depending on the severity of infection. Cefixime can be given orally ( 200 mg twice daily or 400 mg once daily) for respiratory or urinary tract infections. The adult dose for cefpodoxime proxetil or cefditoren pivoxil is $200-400 \mathrm{mg}$ twice daily; for ceftibuten, 400 mg once daily; and for cefdinir, $300 \mathrm{mg} / 12 \mathrm{~h}$. The excretion of cefoperazone and ceftriaxone is mainly through the biliary tract, and no dosage adjustment is required in renal insufficiency. The others are excreted by the kidney and therefore require dosage adjustment in renal insufficiency.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Third-generation cephalosporins are used to treat a wide variety of serious infections caused by organisms that are resistant to most other drugs. Strains expressing extended-spectrum B-lactamases, however, are
not susceptible. Third-generation cephalosporins should be avoided in treatment of enterobacter infections-even if the clinical isolate appears susceptible in vitro-because of emergence of resistance. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime are approved for treatment of meningitis, including meningitis caused by pneumococci, meningococci, H influenzae, and susceptible enteric gram-negative rods, but not by L monocytogenes. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime are the most active cephalosporins against penicillin-resistant strains of pneumococci and are recommended for empirical therapy of serious infections that may be caused by these strains. Meningitis caused by highly penicillin-resistant strains of pneumococci (ie, those susceptible only to penicillin MICs > $1 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ ) may not respond even to these agents, and addition of vancomycin is recommended. Other potential indications include empirical therapy of sepsis of unknown cause in both the immunocompetent and the immunocompromised patient and treatment of infections for which a cephalosporin is the least toxic drug available. In neutropenic, febrile immunocompromised patients, thirdgeneration cephalosporins are often used in combination with an aminoglycoside.

\section*{FOURTH-GENERATION CEPHALOSPORINS}

Cefepime is an example of a so-called fourth-generation cephalosporin. It is more resistant to hydrolysis by chromosomal B-lactamases (eg, those produced by enterobacter). It has good activity against P aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, $S$ aureus, and $S$ pneumoniae. Cefepime is highly active against haemophilus and neisseria. It penetrates well into cerebrospinal fluid. It is cleared by the kidneys and has a half-life of 2 hours, and its pharmacokinetic properties are very similar to those of ceftazidime. Unlike ceftazidime, however, cefepime has good activity against most penicillin-resistant strains of streptococci, and it may be useful in treatment of enterobacter infections. Otherwise, its clinical role is similar to that of third-generation cephalosporins.

\section*{ADVERSE EFFECTS OF CEPHALOSPORINS}

\section*{Allergy}

Cephalosporins are sensitizing and may elicit a variety of hypersensitivity reactions that are identical to those of penicillins, including anaphylaxis, fever, skin rashes, nephritis, granulocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. However, the chemical nucleus of cephalosporins is sufficiently different from that of penicillins so that some individuals with a history of penicillin allergy may tolerate cephalosporins. The frequency of cross-allergenicity between the two groups of drugs is uncertain but is probably around $5-10 \%$. However, patients with a history of anaphylaxis to penicillins should not receive cephalosporins.

\section*{Toxicity}

Local irritation can produce severe pain after intramuscular injection and thrombophlebitis after intravenous injection. Renal toxicity, including interstitial nephritis and even tubular necrosis, has been demonstrated and has caused the withdrawal of cephaloridine from clinical use.

Cephalosporins that contain a methylthiotetrazole group (eg, cefamandole, cefmetazole, cefotetan, cefoperazone) frequently cause hypoprothrombinemia and bleeding disorders. Administration of vitamin $\mathrm{K}_{1}$, 10 mg twice weekly, can prevent this. Drugs with the methylthiotetrazole ring can also cause severe disulfiram-like reactions; consequently, alcohol and alcohol-containing medications must be avoided.

\section*{OTHER BETA-LACTAM DRUGS}

\section*{MONOBACTAMS}

Monobactams are drugs with a monocyclic B-lactam ring (Figure 43-1). They are relatively resistant to Blactamases and active against gram-negative rods (including pseudomonas and serratia). They have no activity against gram-positive bacteria or anaerobes. Aztreonam is the only monobactam available in the USA. It resembles aminoglycosides (Chapter 45) in its spectrum of activity. Aztreonam is given intravenously every 8 hours in a dose of $1-2 \mathrm{~g}$, providing peak serum levels of $100 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. The half-life is $1-2$ hours and is greatly prolonged in renal failure.

Penicillin-allergic patients tolerate aztreonam without reaction. Occasional skin rashes and elevations of serum aminotransferases occur during administration of aztreonam, but major toxicity has not yet been reported. The clinical usefulness of aztreonam has not been fully defined.

\section*{BETA-LACTAMASE I NHI BITORS (CLAVULANIC ACID, SULBACTAM, \& TAZOBACTAM)}

These substances resemble B-lactam molecules (Figure 43-7) but they have very weak antibacterial action. They are potent inhibitors of many but not all bacterial $B$-lactamases and can protect hydrolyzable penicillins from inactivation by these enzymes. B-Lactamase inhibitors are most active against Ambler class A Blactamases (plasmid-encoded transposable element [TEM] B-lactamases in particular), such as those produced by staphylococci, H influenzae, N gonorrhoeae, salmonella, shigella, E coli, and K pneumoniae. They are not good inhibitors of class C B-lactamases, which typically are chromosomally encoded and inducible, produced by enterobacter, citrobacter, serratia, and pseudomonas, but they do inhibit chromosomal Blactamases of bacteroides and branhamella.

B-lactamase inhibitors.

The three inhibitors differ slightly with respect to pharmacology, stability, potency, and activity, but these differences usually are of little therapeutic significance. B-Lactamase inhibitors are available only in fixed combinations with specific penicillins. The antibacterial spectrum of the combination is determined by the companion penicillin, not the $B$-lactamase inhibitor. (The fixed combinations available in the USA are listed in the Preparations Available section.) An inhibitor extends the spectrum of a penicillin provided that the inactivity of the penicillin is due to destruction by $B$-lactamase and that the inhibitor is active against the $B$ lactamase that is produced. Thus, ampicillin-sulbactam is active against $B$-lactamase-producing $S$ aureus and H influenzae but not serratia, which produces a B-lactamase that is not inhibited by sulbactam. Similarly, if a strain of P aeruginosa is resistant to piperacillin, it is also resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam, because tazobactam does not inhibit the chromosomal B-lactamase.

The indications for penicillin- $B$-lactamase inhibitor combinations are empirical therapy for infections caused by
}
a wide range of potential pathogens in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients and treatment of mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections, such as intra-abdominal infections. Doses are the same as those used for the single agents except that the recommended dosage of piperacillin in the piperacillintazobactam combination is 3 g every 6 hours. Adjustments for renal insufficiency are made based on the penicillin component.

\section*{CARBAPENEMS}

The carbapenems are structurally related to B-lactam antibiotics (Figure 43-1). Ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem are licensed for use in the USA. Imipenem has a wide spectrum with good activity against many gram-negative rods, including $P$ aeruginosa, gram-positive organisms, and anaerobes. It is resistant to most B-lactamases but not metallo-B-lactamases. Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci, Clostridium difficile, Burkholderia cepacia, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia are resistant. Imipenem is inactivated by dehydropeptidases in renal tubules, resulting in low urinary concentrations. Consequently, it is administered together with an inhibitor of renal dehydropeptidase, cilastatin, for clinical use. Meropenem is similar to imipenem but has slightly greater activity against gram-negative aerobes and slightly less activity against gram-positives. It is not significantly degraded by renal dehydropeptidase and does not require an inhibitor. Ertapenem is less active than meropenem or imipenem against $P$ aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. It is not degraded by renal dehydropeptidase.

Carbapenems penetrate body tissues and fluids well, including the cerebrospinal fluid. All are cleared renally, and the dose must be reduced in patients with renal insufficiency. The usual dose of imipenem is $0.25-0.5 \mathrm{~g}$ given intravenously every 6-8 hours (half-life 1 hour). The usual adult dose of meropenem is 1 g intravenously every 8 hours. Ertapenem has the longest half-life ( 4 hours) and is administered as a oncedaily dose of 1 g intravenously or intramuscularly. Intramuscular ertapenem is irritating, and for that reason the drug is formulated with $1 \%$ lidocaine for administration by this route.

A carbapenem is indicated for infections caused by susceptible organisms, eg, P aeruginosa, which are resistant to other available drugs and for treatment of mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections. Carbapenems are active against many highly penicillin-resistant strains of pneumococci. A carbapenem is the B-lactam antibiotic of choice for treatment of enterobacter infections because it is resistant to destruction by the $B$ lactamase produced by these organisms; it is also the treatment of choice for infections caused by ESBLproducing gram-negatives. Ertapenem is insufficiently active against $P$ aeruginosa and should not be used to treat infections caused by that organism. Imipenem or meropenem with or without an aminoglycoside may be effective treatment for febrile neutropenic patients.

The most common adverse effects of carbapenems-which tend to be more common with imipenem-are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, and reactions at the infusion sites. Excessive levels of imipenem in patients with renal failure may lead to seizures. Meropenem and ertapenem are less likely to cause seizures than imipenem. Patients allergic to penicillins may be allergic to carbapenems as well.

\section*{OTHER CELL WALL OR MEMBRANE-ACTI VE AGENTS VANCOMYCI N}

Vancomycin is an antibiotic produced by Streptococcus orientalis. With the single exception of flavobacterium, it is active only against gram-positive bacteria, particularly staphylococci. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide of
molecular weight 1500. It is water-soluble and quite stable.

\section*{Mechanisms of Action \& Basis of Resistance}

Vancomycin inhibits cell wall synthesis by binding firmly to the D-Ala- D-Ala terminus of nascent peptidoglycan pentapeptide (Figure 43-5). This inhibits the transglycosylase, preventing further elongation of peptidoglycan and cross-linking. The peptidoglycan is thus weakened, and the cell becomes susceptible to lysis. The cell membrane is also damaged, which contributes to the antibacterial effect.

Resistance to vancomycin in enterococci is due to modification of the D-Ala- D-Ala binding site of the peptidoglycan building block in which the terminal D-Ala is replaced by D-lactate. This results in the loss of a critical hydrogen bond that facilitates high-affinity binding of vancomycin to its target and loss of activity. This mechanism is also present in vancomycin-resistant $S$ aureus strains ( $\mathrm{MIC} \equiv 32 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ ), which have acquired the enterococcal resistance determinants. The mechanism for reduced vancomycin susceptibility of vancomycin-intermediate strains ( MICs $=8-16 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ ) is not known.

\section*{Antibacterial Activity}

Vancomycin is bactericidal for gram-positive bacteria in concentrations of $0.5-10 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Most pathogenic staphylococci, including those producing B-lactamase and those resistant to nafcillin and methicillin, are killed by $2 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ or less. Vancomycin kills staphylococci relatively slowly and only if cells are actively dividing; the rate is less than that of the penicillins both in vitro and in vivo. Vancomycin is synergistic in vitro with gentamicin and streptomycin against Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis strains that do not exhibit high levels of aminoglycoside resistance.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Vancomycin is poorly absorbed from the intestinal tract and is administered orally only for the treatment of antibiotic-associated enterocolitis caused by C difficile. Parenteral doses must be administered intravenously. A 1 -hour intravenous infusion of 1 g produces blood levels of $15-30 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ for $1-2$ hours. The drug is widely distributed in the body. Cerebrospinal fluid levels 7-30\% of simultaneous serum concentrations are achieved if there is meningeal inflammation. Ninety percent of the drug is excreted by glomerular filtration. In the presence of renal insufficiency, striking accumulation may occur (Table 43-2). In functionally anephric patients, the half-life of vancomycin is $6-10$ days. The drug is not removed by hemodialysis.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

The main indication for parenteral vancomycin is sepsis or endocarditis caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci. However, vancomycin is not as effective as an antistaphylococcal penicillin for treatment of serious infections such as endocarditis caused by methicillin-susceptible strains. Vancomycin in combination with gentamicin is an alternative regimen for treatment of enterococcal endocarditis in a patient with serious penicillin allergy. Vancomycin (in combination with cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or rifampin) is also recommended for treatment of meningitis suspected or known to be caused by a highly penicillin-resistant strain of pneumococcus (ie, MIC > $1 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ ). The recommended dosage is $30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in two or three divided doses. A typical dosing regimen for most infections in adults with normal renal function is 1 g every 12 hours. The dosage in children is $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in three or four divided doses. Clearance of vancomycin is directly proportional to creatinine clearance, and the dose is reduced accordingly in patients with renal insufficiency. For functionally anephric adult patients, a 1-g dose administered once a week is usually sufficient. Patients receiving a prolonged course of therapy should have serum concentrations checked. Recommended peak
serum concentrations are $20-50 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$, and trough concentrations are $10-15 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$.
Oral vancomycin, $0.125-0.25 \mathrm{~g}$ every 6 hours, is used to treat antibiotic-associated enterocolitis caused by C difficile. However, because of the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and the strong selective pressure of oral vancomycin for these resistant organisms, metronidazole is strongly preferred as initial therapy and vancomycin should be reserved for treatment of refractory cases.

\section*{Adverse Reactions}

Adverse reactions are encountered in about 10\% of cases. Most reactions are minor. Vancomycin is irritating to tissue, resulting in phlebitis at the site of injection. Chills and fever may occur. Ototoxicity is rare and nephrotoxicity uncommon with current preparations. However, administration with another ototoxic or nephrotoxic drug, such as an aminoglycoside, increases the risk of these toxicities. Ototoxicity can be minimized by maintaining peak serum concentrations below $60 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Among the more common reactions is the so-called "red man" or "red neck" syndrome. This infusion-related flushing is caused by release of histamine. It can be largely prevented by prolonging the infusion period to 1-2 hours or increasing the dosing interval.

\section*{TEI COPLANI N}

Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is very similar to vancomycin in mechanism of action and antibacterial spectrum. Unlike vancomycin, it can be given intramuscularly as well as intravenously. Teicoplanin has a long half-life (45-70 hours), permitting once-daily dosing. This drug is available in Europe but has not been approved for use in the United States.

\section*{DAPTOMYCIN}

Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide fermentation product of Streptomyces roseosporus (Figure 43-8). Its spectrum of activity is similar to that of vancomycin except that it is more rapidly bactericidal in vitro and it is active against vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococci and vancomycin-intermediate and -resistant strains of S aureus. The precise mechanism of action is not known, but it appears to bind to and depolarize the cell membrane, causing potassium efflux and rapid cell death. Daptomycin is cleared renally. The recommended doses are $4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ dose for treatment of skin and soft tissue infections and $6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ dose for treatment of bacteremia and endocarditis once daily in patients with normal renal function and every other day in patients with creatinine clearance of less than $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. In clinical trials powered for noninferiority, daptomycin was equivalent in efficacy to vancomycin. It can cause myopathy, and creatine phosphokinase levels should be monitored. Pulmonary surfactant antagonizes daptomycin and it should not be used to treat pneumonia. Scattered cases of treatment failures have been reported in association with an increase in daptomycin MIC for clinical isolates obtained during therapy. The relation between an increase in MIC and treatment failure is unclear at this point. Daptomycin is an effective alternative to vancomycin, and its ultimate role continues to unfold.

Structure of daptomycin.

\section*{FOSFOMYCIN}

Fosfomycin trometamol, a stable salt of fosfomycin (phosphonomycin), inhibits a very early stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis (Figure 43-5). An analog of phosphoenolpyruvate, it is structurally unrelated to any other antimicrobial agent. It inhibits the cytoplasmic enzyme enolpyruvate transferase by covalently binding to the cysteine residue of the active site and blocking the addition of phosphoenolpyruvate to UDP- N acetylglucosamine. This reaction is the first step in the formation of UDP- N - acetylmuramic acid, the precursor of N- acetylmuramic acid, which is found only in bacterial cell walls. The drug is transported into the bacterial cell by glycerophosphate or glucose 6-phosphate transport systems. Resistance is due to inadequate
transport of drug into the cell.
Fosfomycin is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms at concentrations $s 125$ $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Susceptibility tests should be performed in growth medium supplemented with glucose 6 -phosphate to minimize false-positive indications of resistance. In vitro synergism occurs when fosfomycin is combined with B-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, or fluoroquinolones.

Fosfomycin trometamol is available in both oral and parenteral formulations, although only the oral preparation is approved for use in the USA. Oral bioavailability is approximately $40 \%$. Peak serum concentrations are $10 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ and $30 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ following a $2-\mathrm{g}$ or $4-\mathrm{g}$ oral dose, respectively. The half-life is approximately 4 hours. The active drug is excreted by the kidney, with urinary concentrations exceeding MICs for most urinary tract pathogens.

Fosfomycin is approved for use as a single 3-g dose for treatment of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in women. The drug appears to be safe for use in pregnancy.

\section*{BACI TRACI N}

Bacitracin is a cyclic peptide mixture first obtained from the Tracy strain of Bacillus subtilis in 1943. It is active against gram-positive microorganisms. Bacitracin inhibits cell wall formation by interfering with dephosphorylation in cycling of the lipid carrier that transfers peptidoglycan subunits to the growing cell wall (Figure 43-5). There is no cross-resistance between bacitracin and other antimicrobial drugs.

Bacitracin is highly nephrotoxic when administered systemically and is only used topically (Chapter 62). Bacitracin is poorly absorbed. Topical application results in local antibacterial activity without systemic toxicity. Bacitracin, 500 units/g in an ointment base (often combined with polymyxin or neomycin), is indicated for the suppression of mixed bacterial flora in surface lesions of the skin, in wounds, or on mucous membranes. Solutions of bacitracin containing 100-200 units $/ \mathrm{mL}$ in saline can be used for irrigation of joints, wounds, or the pleural cavity.

\section*{CYCLOSERINE}

Cycloserine is an antibiotic produced by Streptomyces orchidaceus. It is water-soluble and very unstable at acid pH. Cycloserine inhibits many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, but it is used almost exclusively to treat tuberculosis caused by strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to first-line agents. Cycloserine is a structural analog of D -alanine and inhibits the incorporation of D -alanine into peptidoglycan pentapeptide by inhibiting alanine racemase, which converts L-alanine to D-alanine, and D-alanyl- Dalanine ligase (Figure 43-5). After ingestion of 0.25 g of cycloserine blood levels reach 20-30 $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$-sufficient to inhibit many strains of mycobacteria and gram-negative bacteria. The drug is widely distributed in tissues. Most of the drug is excreted in active form into the urine. The dosage for treating tuberculosis is 0.5 to $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ in two or three divided doses.

Cycloserine causes serious dose-related central nervous system toxicity with headaches, tremors, acute psychosis, and convulsions. If oral dosages are maintained below $0.75 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$, such effects can usually be avoided.

Free tetracyclines are crystalline amphoteric substances of low solubility. They are available as hydrochlorides, which are more soluble. Such solutions are acid and, with the exception of chlortetracycline, fairly stable. Tetracyclines chelate divalent metal ions, which can interfere with their absorption and activity. A newly approved tetracycline analog, tigecycline, is a glycylcycline and a semisynthetic derivative of minocycline.

\section*{Antimicrobial Activity}

Tetracyclines are broad-spectrum bacteriostatic antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis. They are active against many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including anaerobes, rickettsiae, chlamydiae, mycoplasmas, and L forms; and against some protozoa, eg, amebas. The antibacterial activities of most tetracyclines are similar except that tetracycline-resistant strains may be susceptible to doxycycline, minocycline, and tigecycline, all of which are poor substrates for the efflux pump that
mediates resistance. Differences in clinical efficacy for susceptible organisms are minor and attributable largely to features of absorption, distribution, and excretion of individual drugs.

Tetracyclines enter microorganisms in part by passive diffusion and in part by an energy-dependent process of active transport. Susceptible cells concentrate the drug intracellularly. Once inside the cell, tetracyclines bind reversibly to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, blocking the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the acceptor site on the mRNA-ribosome complex (Figure 44-1). This prevents addition of amino acids to the growing peptide.

\section*{Figure 44-1.}

Steps in bacterial protein synthesis and targets of several antibiotics. Amino acids are shown as numbered circles. The 70 S ribosomal mRNA complex is shown with its 50 S and 30 S subunits. In step 1, the charged tRNA unit carrying amino acid 8 binds to the acceptor site A on the 70S ribosome. The peptidyl tRNA at the donor site, with amino acids 1 through 7, then binds the growing amino acid chain to amino acid 8 (transpeptidation, step 2). The uncharged tRNA left at the donor site is released (step 3), and the new 8-amino acid chain with its tRNA shifts to the peptidyl site (translocation, step 4). The antibiotic binding sites are shown schematically as triangles. Chloramphenicol (C) and macrolides (M) bind to the 50S subunit and block transpeptidation (step 2). The tetracyclines (T) bind to the 30S subunit and prevent binding of the incoming charged tRNA unit (step 1).

\section*{Resistance}

Three mechanisms of resistance to tetracycline analogs have been described: (1) impaired influx or increased efflux by an active transport protein pump; (2) ribosome protection due to production of proteins that interfere with tetracycline binding to the ribosome; and (3) enzymatic inactivation. The most important of these are production of an efflux pump and ribosomal protection. Tet(AE) efflux pump-expressing gram-negative species are resistant to the older tetracyclines, doxycycline, and minocycline. They are susceptible, however, to tigecycline, which is not a substrate of these pumps. Similarly, the Tet(K) efflux pump of staphylococci confers resistance to tetracyclines, but not to
doxycycline, minocycline, or tigecycline, none of which are pump substrates. The Tet(M) ribosomal protection protein expressed by gram-positives produces resistance to the tetracyclines, doxycycline, and minocycline, but not to tigecycline, which because of its bulky t-butylglycylamido substituent has a steric hindrance effect on Tet(M) binding to the ribosome. Tigecycline is a substrate of the chromosomally encoded multidrug efflux pumps of Proteus sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, accounting for their intrinsic resistance to all tetracyclines including tigecycline.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Tetracyclines mainly differ in their absorption after oral administration and their elimination. Absorption after oral administration is approximately 30\% for chlortetracycline; 60-70\% for tetracycline, oxytetracycline, demeclocycline, and methacycline; and 95-100\% for doxycycline and minocycline. Tigecycline is poorly absorbed orally and must be administered intravenously. A portion of an orally administered dose of tetracycline remains in the gut lumen, modifies intestinal flora, and is excreted in the feces. Absorption occurs mainly in the upper small intestine and is impaired by food (except doxycycline and minocycline); by divalent cations ( $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{Mg}^{2+}, \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ) or $\mathrm{Al}^{3+}$; by dairy products and antacids, which contain multivalent cations; and by alkaline pH. Specially buffered tetracycline solutions are formulated for intravenous administration.

Tetracyclines are 40-80\% bound by serum proteins. Oral dosages of 500 mg every 6 hours of tetracycline hydrochloride or oxytetracycline produce peak blood levels of $4-6 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Intravenously injected tetracyclines give somewhat higher levels, but only temporarily. Peak levels of $2-4 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ are achieved with a $200-\mathrm{mg}$ dose of doxycycline or minocycline. Steady-state peak serum concentrations of tigecycline are $0.6 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ at the usual dosage. Tetracyclines are distributed widely to tissues and body fluids except for cerebrospinal fluid, where concentrations are 10-25\% of those in serum. Minocycline reaches very high concentrations in tears and saliva, which makes it useful for eradication of the meningococcal carrier state. Tetracyclines cross the placenta to reach the fetus and are also excreted in milk. As a result of chelation with calcium, tetracyclines are bound to-and damage-growing bones and teeth. Carbamazepine, phenytoin, barbiturates, and chronic alcohol ingestion may shorten the half-life of doxycycline $50 \%$ by induction of hepatic enzymes that metabolize the drug.

Tetracyclines are excreted mainly in bile and urine. Concentrations in bile exceed those in serum tenfold. Some of the drug excreted in bile is reabsorbed from the intestine (enterohepatic circulation) and may contribute to maintenance of serum levels. Ten to 50 percent of various tetracyclines is excreted into the urine, mainly by glomerular filtration. Ten to 40 percent of the drug is excreted in feces. Doxycycline and tigecycline, in contrast to other tetracyclines, are eliminated by nonrenal mechanisms, do not accumulate significantly and require no dosage adjustment in renal failure.

Tetracyclines are classified as short-acting (chlortetracycline, tetracycline, oxytetracycline), intermediate-acting (demeclocycline and methacycline), or long-acting (doxycycline and minocycline) based on serum half-lives of 6-8 hours, 12 hours, and 16-18 hours, respectively. Tigecycline has a half-life of 36 hours. The almost complete absorption and slow excretion of doxycycline and minocycline allow for once-daily dosing.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

A tetracycline is the drug of choice in infections with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydiae, rickettsiae,
and some spirochetes. They are used in combination regimens to treat gastric and duodenal ulcer disease caused by Helicobacter pylori. They may be used in various gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections, including vibrio infections, provided the organism is not resistant. In cholera, tetracyclines rapidly stop the shedding of vibrios, but tetracycline resistance has appeared during epidemics. Tetracyclines remain effective in most chlamydial infections, including sexually transmitted diseases. Tetracyclines are no longer recommended for treatment of gonococcal disease because of resistance. A tetracycline-usually in combination with an aminoglycoside-is indicated for plague, tularemia, and brucellosis. Tetracyclines are sometimes used in the treatment of protozoal infections, eg, those due to Entamoeba histolytica or Plasmodium falciparum (see Chapter 53). Other uses include treatment of acne, exacerbations of bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, Lyme disease, relapsing fever, leptospirosis, and some nontuberculous mycobacterial infections (eg, Mycobacterium marinum). Tetracyclines formerly were used for a variety of common infections, including bacterial gastroenteritis, pneumonia (other than mycoplasmal or chlamydial pneumonia), and urinary tract infections. However, many strains of bacteria causing these infections now are resistant, and other agents have largely supplanted tetracyclines.

Minocycline, 200 mg orally daily for 5 days, can eradicate the meningococcal carrier state, but because of side effects and resistance of many meningococcal strains, rifampin is preferred. Demeclocycline inhibits the action of ADH in the renal tubule and has been used in the treatment of inappropriate secretion of ADH or similar peptides by certain tumors (see Chapter 15).

Tigecycline, the first glycylcycline to reach the clinic, has several unique features that warrant its consideration apart from the older tetracyclines. Many tetracycline-resistant strains are susceptible to tigecycline because the common resistance determinants have no activity against it. Its spectrum is very broad. Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillinresistant, vancomycin-intermediate, and vancomycin-resistant strains; streptococci, penicillinsusceptible and -resistant; enterococci, including vancomycin-resistant strains; gram-positive rods; Enterobacteriaceae; multidrug-resistant strains of Acinetobacter sp; anaerobes, both gram-positive and gram-negative; atypical agents, rickettsiae, chlamydia, and legionella; and rapidly growing mycobacteria all are susceptible. Proteus and P aeruginosa, however, are intrinsically resistant.

Tigecycline, formulated for intravenous administration only, is given as a $100-\mathrm{mg}$ loading dose; then 50 mg every 12 hours. As with all tetracyclines, tissue and intracellular penetration is excellent; consequently, the volume of distribution is quite large and peak serum concentrations are somewhat blunted. Elimination is primarily biliary, and no dosage adjustment is needed for patients with renal insufficiency. In addition to the tetracycline class effects, the chief adverse effect of tigecycline is nausea, which occurs in up to one third of patients, and occasionally vomiting. Neither nausea nor vomiting usually requires discontinuation of the drug.

Tigecycline is FDA-approved for treatment of skin and skin-structure infection and intraabdominal infections. Because active drug concentrations in the urine are relatively low, tigecycline may not be effective for urinary tract infections and has no indication for this use. Because it is active against a wide variety of multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens (eg, methicillin-resistant S aureus, extended-spectrum B-lactamase-producing gram-negatives, and acinetobacter sp.), tigecycline is a welcome addition to the antimicrobial drug group.

\section*{ORAL DOSAGE}

The oral dosage for rapidly excreted tetracyclines, equivalent to tetracycline hydrochloride, is 0.25-0.5 g four times daily for adults and $20-40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ for children ( 8 years of age and older). For severe systemic infections, the higher dosage is indicated, at least for the first few days. The daily dose is 600 mg for demeclocycline or methacycline, 100 mg once or twice daily for doxycycline, and 100 mg twice daily for minocycline. Doxycycline is the oral tetracycline of choice because it can be given as a oncedaily dose and its absorption is not significantly affected by food. All tetracyclines chelate with metals, and none should be orally administered with milk, antacids, or ferrous sulfate. To avoid deposition in growing bones or teeth, tetracyclines should be avoided in pregnant women and children under 8 years of age.

\section*{PARENTERAL DOSAGE}

Several tetracyclines are available for intravenous injection in doses of 0.1-0.5 g every 6-12 hours (similar to oral doses) but doxycycline is the usual preferred agent, at a dosage of 100 mg every 12-24 hours. Intramuscular injection is not recommended because of pain and inflammation at the injection site.

\section*{Adverse Reactions}

Hypersensitivity reactions (drug fever, skin rashes) to tetracyclines are uncommon. Most adverse effects are due to direct toxicity of the drug or to alteration of microbial flora.

\section*{GASTROI NTESTI NAL ADVERSE EFFECTS}

Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are the most common reasons for discontinuing tetracycline medication. These effects are attributable to direct local irritation of the intestinal tract. Nausea, anorexia, and diarrhea can usually be controlled by administering the drug with food or carboxymethylcellulose, reducing drug dosage, or discontinuing the drug.

Tetracyclines modify the normal flora, with suppression of susceptible coliform organisms and overgrowth of pseudomonas, proteus, staphylococci, resistant coliforms, clostridia, and candida. This can result in intestinal functional disturbances, anal pruritus, vaginal or oral candidiasis, or enterocolitis with shock and death.

\section*{BONY STRUCTURES AND TEETH}

Tetracyclines are readily bound to calcium deposited in newly formed bone or teeth in young children. When a tetracycline is given during pregnancy, it can be deposited in the fetal teeth, leading to fluorescence, discoloration, and enamel dysplasia; it can also be deposited in bone, where it may cause deformity or growth inhibition. If the drug is given for long periods to children under 8 years of age, similar changes can result.

\section*{LIVER TOXI CITY}

Tetracyclines can probably impair hepatic function, especially during pregnancy, in patients with preexisting hepatic insufficiency and when high doses are given intravenously. Hepatic necrosis has been reported with daily doses of 4 g or more intravenously.

\section*{KIDNEY TOXICITY}

Renal tubular acidosis and other renal injury resulting in nitrogen retention have been attributed to the administration of outdated tetracycline preparations. Tetracyclines given along with diuretics may produce nitrogen retention. Tetracyclines other than doxycycline may accumulate to toxic levels in patients with impaired kidney function.

\section*{LOCAL TISSUE TOXI CITY}

Intravenous injection can lead to venous thrombosis. Intramuscular injection produces painful local irritation and should be avoided.

\section*{PHOTOSENSITIZATION}

Systemically administered tetracycline, especially demeclocycline, can induce sensitivity to sunlight or ultraviolet light, particularly in fair-skinned persons.

\section*{VESTIBULAR REACTIONS}

Dizziness, vertigo, nausea, and vomiting have been noted particularly with doxycycline at doses above 100 mg . With dosages of $200-400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ of minocycline, $35-70 \%$ of patients will have these reactions.

\section*{MACROLI DES}

The macrolides are a group of closely related compounds characterized by a macrocyclic lactone ring (usually containing 14 or 16 atoms) to which deoxy sugars are attached. The prototype drug, erythromycin, which consists of two sugar moieties attached to a 14-atom lactone ring, was obtained in 1952 from Streptomyces erythreus. Clarithromycin and azithromycin are semisynthetic derivatives of erythromycin.

Clarithromycin ( $\mathrm{R}_{1}, \mathrm{R}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ )

\section*{ERYTHROMYCI N}

\section*{Chemistry}

The general structure of erythromycin is shown above with the macrolide ring and the sugars desosamine and cladinose. It is poorly soluble in water ( $0.1 \%$ ) but dissolves readily in organic solvents. Solutions are fairly stable at $4{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ but lose activity rapidly at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and at acid pH . Erythromycins are usually dispensed as various esters and salts.

\section*{Antimicrobial Activity}

Erythromycin is effective against gram-positive organisms, especially pneumococci, streptococci, staphylococci, and corynebacteria, in plasma concentrations of $0.02-2 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Mycoplasma, legionella, Chlamydia trachomatis, C psittaci, C pneumoniae, helicobacter, listeria, and certain mycobacteria (Mycobacterium kansasii, M scrofulaceum) are also susceptible. Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria sp, Bordetella pertussis, Bartonella henselae, and B quintana (etiologic agents of cat-scratch disease and bacillary angiomatosis), some rickettsia sp, Treponema pallidum, and campylobacter sp are susceptible. Haemophilus influenzae is somewhat less susceptible.

The antibacterial action of erythromycin may be inhibitory or bactericidal, particularly at higher concentrations, for susceptible organisms. Activity is enhanced at alkaline pH. Inhibition of protein synthesis occurs via binding to the 50 S ribosomal RNA, which blocks the aminoacyl translocation reaction and formation of initiation complexes (Figure 44-1).

\section*{Resistance}

Resistance to erythromycin is usually plasmid-encoded. Three mechanisms have been identified: (1) reduced permeability of the cell membrane or active efflux; (2) production (by Enterobacteriaceae) of esterases that hydrolyze macrolides; and (3) modification of the ribosomal binding site (so-called ribosomal protection) by chromosomal mutation or by a macrolide-inducible or constitutive methylase. Efflux and methylase production are by far the most important resistance mechanisms in gram-positive organisms. Cross-resistance is complete between erythromycin and the other macrolides. Constitutive methylase production also confers resistance to structurally unrelated but mechanistically similar compounds such as clindamycin and streptogramin B (so-called macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin, or MLS-type B, resistance), which share the same ribosomal binding site. Because nonmacrolides are poor inducers of the methylase, strains expressing an inducible methylase will appear susceptible in vitro. However, constitutive mutants that are resistant can be selected out and emerge during therapy with clindamycin.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Erythromycin base is destroyed by stomach acid and must be administered with enteric coating. Food interferes with absorption. Stearates and esters are fairly acid-resistant and somewhat better absorbed. The lauryl salt of the propionyl ester of erythromycin (erythromycin estolate) is the bestabsorbed oral preparation. Oral dosage of $2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ results in serum erythromycin base and ester concentrations of approximately $2 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. However, only the base is microbiologically active, and its concentration tends to be similar regardless of the formulation. A $500-\mathrm{mg}$ intravenous dose of erythromycin lactobionate produces serum concentrations of $10 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL} 1$ hour after dosing. The serum half-life is approximately 1.5 hours normally and 5 hours in patients with anuria. Adjustment for renal failure is not necessary. Erythromycin is not removed by dialysis. Large amounts of an administered dose are excreted in the bile and lost in feces, and only 5\% is excreted in the urine. Absorbed drug is distributed widely except to the brain and cerebrospinal fluid. Erythromycin is taken up by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages. It traverses the placenta and reaches the fetus.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

An erythromycin is a drug of choice in corynebacterial infections (diphtheria, corynebacterial sepsis, erythrasma); in respiratory, neonatal, ocular, or genital chlamydial infections; and in treatment of
community-acquired pneumonia because its spectrum of activity includes pneumococcus, mycoplasma, and legionella. Erythromycin is also useful as a penicillin substitute in penicillin-allergic individuals with infections caused by staphylococci (assuming that the isolate is susceptible), streptococci, or pneumococci. Emergence of erythromycin resistance in strains of group A streptococci and pneumococci (penicillin-resistant pneumococci in particular) has made macrolides less attractive as first-line agents for treatment of pharyngitis, skin and soft tissue infections, and pneumonia.
Erythromycin has been recommended as prophylaxis against endocarditis during dental procedures in individuals with valvular heart disease, although clindamycin, which is better tolerated, has largely replaced it. Although erythromycin estolate is the best-absorbed salt, it imposes the greatest risk of adverse reactions. Therefore, the stearate or succinate salt may be preferred.

The oral dosage of erythromycin base, stearate, or estolate is $0.25-0.5 \mathrm{~g}$ every 6 hours (for children, $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ). The dosage of erythromycin ethylsuccinate is $0.4-0.6 \mathrm{~g}$ every 6 hours. Oral erythromycin base ( 1 g ) is sometimes combined with oral neomycin or kanamycin for preoperative preparation of the colon. The intravenous dosage of erythromycin gluceptate or lactobionate is $0.5-1.0 \mathrm{~g}$ every 6 hours for adults and $20-40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ for children. The higher dosage is recommended when treating pneumonia caused by Legionella sp.

\section*{Adverse Reactions}

\section*{GASTROI NTESTI NAL EFFECTS}

Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea occasionally accompany oral administration. Gastrointestinal intolerance, which is due to a direct stimulation of gut motility, is the most common reason for discontinuing erythromycin and substituting another antibiotic.

\section*{LIVER TOXICITY}

Erythromycins, particularly the estolate, can produce acute cholestatic hepatitis (fever, jaundice, impaired liver function), probably as a hypersensitivity reaction. Most patients recover from this, but hepatitis recurs if the drug is readministered. Other allergic reactions include fever, eosinophilia, and rashes.

\section*{DRUG INTERACTIONS}

Erythromycin metabolites can inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes and thus increase the serum concentrations of numerous drugs, including theophylline, oral anticoagulants, cyclosporine, and methylprednisolone. Erythromycin increases serum concentrations of oral digoxin by increasing its bioavailability.

\section*{CLARITHROMYCIN}

Clarithromycin is derived from erythromycin by addition of a methyl group and has improved acid stability and oral absorption compared with erythromycin. Its mechanism of action is the same as that of erythromycin. Clarithromycin and erythromycin are virtually identical with respect to antibacterial activity except that clarithromycin is more active against Mycobacterium avium complex (see Chapter 47). Clarithromycin also has activity against M leprae and Toxoplasma gondii. Erythromycin-resistant streptococci and staphylococci are also resistant to clarithromycin.

A $500-\mathrm{mg}$ dose of clarithromycin produces serum concentrations of $2-3 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. The longer half-life of clarithromycin (6 hours) compared with erythromycin permits twice-daily dosing. The recommended dosage is $250-500 \mathrm{mg}$ twice daily or 1000 mg of the extended release formulation once daily.

Clarithromycin penetrates most tissues well, with concentrations equal to or exceeding serum concentrations.

Clarithromycin is metabolized in the liver. The major metabolite is 14-hydroxyclarithromycin, which also has antibacterial activity. A portion of active drug and this major metabolite is eliminated in the urine, and dosage reduction (eg, a $500-\mathrm{mg}$ loading dose, then 250 mg once or twice daily) is recommended for patients with creatinine clearances less than $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. Clarithromycin has drug interactions similar to those described for erythromycin.

The advantages of clarithromycin compared with erythromycin are lower incidence of gastrointestinal intolerance and less frequent dosing. Except for the specific organisms noted above, the two drugs are otherwise therapeutically very similar, and the choice of one over the other usually turns out to be cost and tolerability.

\section*{AZI THROMYCI N}

Azithromycin, a 15-atom lactone macrolide ring compound, is derived from erythromycin by addition of a methylated nitrogen into the lactone ring. Its spectrum of activity and clinical uses are virtually identical to those of clarithromycin. Azithromycin is active against M avium complex and T gondii. Azithromycin is slightly less active than erythromycin and clarithromycin against staphylococci and streptococci and slightly more active against H influenzae. Azithromycin is highly active against chlamydia.

Azithromycin differs from erythromycin and clarithromycin mainly in pharmacokinetic properties. A 500-mg dose of azithromycin produces relatively low serum concentrations of approximately 0.4 $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. However, azithromycin penetrates into most tissues (except cerebrospinal fluid) and phagocytic cells extremely well, with tissue concentrations exceeding serum concentrations by 10- to 100-fold. The drug is slowly released from tissues (tissue half-life of 2-4 days) to produce an elimination half-life approaching 3 days. These unique properties permit once-daily dosing and shortening of the duration of treatment in many cases. For example, a single 1-g dose of azithromycin is as effective as a 7-day course of doxycycline for chlamydial cervicitis and urethritis. Communityacquired pneumonia can be treated with azithromycin given as a $500-\mathrm{mg}$ loading dose, followed by a $250-\mathrm{mg}$ single daily dose for the next 4 days.

Azithromycin is rapidly absorbed and well tolerated orally. It should be administered 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals. Aluminum and magnesium antacids do not alter bioavailability but delay absorption and reduce peak serum concentrations. Because it has a 15 -member (not 14 -member) lactone ring, azithromycin does not inactivate cytochrome P450 enzymes and therefore is free of the drug interactions that occur with erythromycin and clarithromycin.

\section*{KETOLI DES}

Ketolides are semisynthetic 14-membered-ring macrolides, differing from erythromycin by substitution of a 3-keto group for the neutral sugar I-cladinose. Telithromycin is approved for clinical use. It is active in vitro against Streptococcus pyogenes, S pneumoniae, S aureus, H influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, mycoplasmas, Legionella sp, chlamydia sp, H pylori, N gonorrhoeae, B fragilis, T gondii, and nontuberculosis mycobacteria. Many macrolide-resistant strains are susceptible to ketolides because the structural modification of these compounds renders them poor substrates for efflux pump-
mediated resistance and they bind to ribosomes of some bacterial species with higher affinity than macrolides.

Oral bioavailability of telithromycin is $57 \%$, and tissue and intracellular penetration is generally good. Telithromycin is metabolized in the liver and eliminated by a combination of biliary and urinary routes of excretion. It is administered as a once-daily dose of 800 mg , which results in peak serum concentrations of approximately $2 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Telithromycin is indicated for treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, sinusitis, and streptococcal pharyngitis. It is a reversible inhibitor of the CYP3A4 enzyme system and may slightly prolong the $\mathrm{QT}_{\mathrm{c}}$ interval. Rare cases of hepatitis and liver failure have been reported.

\section*{CLI NDAMYCI N}

Clindamycin is a chlorine-substituted derivative of lincomycin, an antibiotic that is elaborated by Streptomyces lincolnensis.

Clindamycin

\section*{Antibacterial Activity}

Streptococci, staphylococci, and pneumococci are inhibited by clindamycin, $0.5-5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Enterococci and gram-negative aerobic organisms are resistant (in contrast to their susceptibility to erythromycin). Bacteroides sp and other anaerobes, both gram-positive and gram-negative, are usually susceptible. Clindamycin, like erythromycin, inhibits protein synthesis by interfering with the formation of initiation complexes and with aminoacyl translocation reactions. The binding site for clindamycin on the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome is identical with that for erythromycin. Resistance to clindamycin, which generally confers cross-resistance to macrolides, is due to (1) mutation of the ribosomal receptor site; (2) modification of the receptor by a constitutively expressed methylase (see section on Erythromycin Resistance, above); and (3) enzymatic inactivation of clindamycin. Gram-negative aerobic species are intrinsically resistant because of poor permeability of the outer membrane.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Oral dosages of clindamycin, $0.15-0.3 \mathrm{~g}$ every 8 hours ( $10-20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ for children), yield serum levels of $2-3 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. When administered intravenously, 600 mg of clindamycin every 8 hours gives levels of $5-15 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. The drug is about $90 \%$ protein-bound. Clindamycin penetrates well into most tissues, with brain and cerebrospinal fluid being important exceptions. It penetrates well into abscesses and is actively taken up and concentrated by phagocytic cells. Clindamycin is metabolized
by the liver, and both active drug and active metabolites are excreted in bile and urine. The half-life is about 2.5 hours in normal individuals, increasing to 6 hours in patients with anuria. No dosage adjustment is required for renal failure.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Clindamycin is indicated for treatment of anaerobic infection caused by bacteroides and other anaerobes that often participate in mixed infections. Clindamycin, sometimes in combination with an aminoglycoside or cephalosporin, is used to treat penetrating wounds of the abdomen and the gut; infections originating in the female genital tract, eg, septic abortion and pelvic abscesses; and aspiration pneumonia. Clindamycin is now recommended rather than erythromycin for prophylaxis of endocarditis in patients with valvular heart disease who are undergoing certain dental procedures. Clindamycin plus primaquine is an effective alternative to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for moderate to moderately severe Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in AIDS patients. It is also used in combination with pyrimethamine for AIDS-related toxoplasmosis of the brain.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Common adverse effects are diarrhea, nausea, and skin rashes. Impaired liver function (with or without jaundice) and neutropenia sometimes occur. Severe diarrhea and enterocolitis have followed clindamycin administration. Administration of clindamycin is a risk factor for diarrhea and colitis due to Clostridium difficile.

\section*{CHLORAMPHENICOL}

Crystalline chloramphenicol is a neutral, stable compound with the following structure:
<smiles>O=C(CCl)NC(CO)C(O)c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1</smiles>

Chloramphenicol

It is soluble in alcohol but poorly soluble in water. Chloramphenicol succinate, which is used for parenteral administration, is highly water-soluble. It is hydrolyzed in vivo with liberation of free chloramphenicol.

\section*{Antimicrobial Activity}

Chloramphenicol is a potent inhibitor of microbial protein synthesis. It binds reversibly to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome (Figure 44-1) and inhibits the peptidyl transferase step of protein synthesis. Chloramphenicol is a bacteriostatic broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. It is active also against rickettsiae but not chlamydiae. Most gram-positive bacteria are inhibited at concentrations of $1-10 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$, and many gram-negative bacteria are inhibited by concentrations of $0.2-5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL} . \mathrm{H}$ influenzae, N meningitidis, and some strains of bacteroides are highly susceptible, and for them chloramphenicol may be bactericidal.

Low-level resistance to chloramphenicol may emerge from large populations of chloramphenicolsusceptible cells by selection of mutants that are less permeable to the drug. Clinically significant
resistance is due to production of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, a plasmid-encoded enzyme that inactivates the drug.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

The usual dosage of chloramphenicol is $50-100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. After oral administration, crystalline chloramphenicol is rapidly and completely absorbed. A 1-g oral dose produces blood levels between 10 and $15 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Chloramphenicol palmitate is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed in the intestine to yield free chloramphenicol. The parenteral formulation is a prodrug, chloramphenicol succinate, which hydrolyzes to yield free chloramphenicol, giving blood levels somewhat lower than those achieved with orally administered drug. Chloramphenicol is widely distributed to virtually all tissues and body fluids, including the central nervous system and cerebrospinal fluid, such that the concentration of chloramphenicol in brain tissue may be equal to that in serum. The drug penetrates cell membranes readily.

Most of the drug is inactivated either by conjugation with glucuronic acid (principally in the liver) or by reduction to inactive aryl amines. Active chloramphenicol (about 10\% of the total dose administered) and its inactive degradation products (about $90 \%$ of the total) are eliminated in the urine. A small amount of active drug is excreted into bile and feces. The systemic dosage of chloramphenicol need not be altered in renal insufficiency, but it must be reduced markedly in hepatic failure. Newborns less than a week old and premature infants also clear chloramphenicol less well, and the dosage should be reduced to $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Because of potential toxicity, bacterial resistance, and the availability of many other effective alternatives, chloramphenicol is rarely used. It may be considered for treatment of serious rickettsial infections such as typhus and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. It is an alternative to a B-lactam antibiotic for treatment of meningococcal meningitis occurring in patients who have major hypersensitivity reactions to penicillin or bacterial meningitis caused by penicillin-resistant strains of pneumococci. The dosage is $50-100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in four divided doses.

Chloramphenicol is used topically in the treatment of eye infections because of its broad spectrum and its penetration of ocular tissues and the aqueous humor. It is ineffective for chlamydial infections.

\section*{Adverse Reactions}

\section*{GASTROI NTESTI NAL DI STURBANCES}

Adults occasionally develop nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. This is rare in children. Oral or vaginal candidiasis may occur as a result of alteration of normal microbial flora.

\section*{BONE MARROW DISTURBANCES}

Chloramphenicol commonly causes a dose-related reversible suppression of red cell production at dosages exceeding $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ after $1-2$ weeks. Aplastic anemia, a rare consequence ( 1 in 24,000 to 40,000 courses of therapy) of chloramphenicol administration by any route, is an idiosyncratic reaction unrelated to dose, although it occurs more frequently with prolonged use. It tends to be irreversible and can be fatal.

\section*{TOXICITY FOR NEWBORN INFANTS}

Newborn infants lack an effective glucuronic acid conjugation mechanism for the degradation and
detoxification of chloramphenicol. Consequently, when infants are given dosages above $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$, the drug may accumulate, resulting in the gray baby syndrome, with vomiting, flaccidity, hypothermia, gray color, shock, and collapse. To avoid this toxic effect, chloramphenicol should be used with caution in infants and the dosage limited to $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ or less (during the first week of life) in full-term infants more than 1 week old and $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in premature infants.

\section*{INTERACTION WITH OTHER DRUGS}

Chloramphenicol inhibits hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize several drugs. Half-lives are prolonged, and the serum concentrations of phenytoin, tolbutamide, chlorpropamide, and warfarin are increased. Like other bacteriostatic inhibitors of microbial protein synthesis, chloramphenicol can antagonize bactericidal drugs such as penicillins or aminoglycosides.

\section*{STREPTOGRAMI NS}

Quinupristin-dalfopristin is a combination of two streptogramins-quinupristin, a streptogramin B, and dalfopristin, a streptogramin A—in a 30:70 ratio. It is rapidly bactericidal for most organisms except Enterococcus faecium, which is killed slowly. Quinupristin-dalfopristin is active against grampositive cocci, including multidrug-resistant strains of streptococci, penicillin-resistant strains of S pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of staphylococci, and E faecium (but not E faecalis). Resistance is due to modification of the quinupristin binding site (MLS-B type), enzymatic inactivation of dalfopristin, or efflux.

Quinupristin-dalfopristin is administered intravenously at a dosage of $7.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ every $8-12 \mathrm{hours}$. Peak serum concentrations following an infusion of $7.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ over 60 minutes are $3 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ for quinupristin and $7 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ for dalfopristin. Quinupristin and dalfopristin are rapidly metabolized, with half-lives of 0.85 and 0.7 hours, respectively. Elimination is principally by the fecal route. Dose adjustment is not necessary for renal failure, peritoneal dialysis, or hemodialysis. Patients with hepatic insufficiency may not tolerate the drug at usual doses, however, because of increased area under the concentration curve of both parent drugs and metabolites. This may necessitate a dose reduction to $7.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ every 12 hours or $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ every 8 hours. Quinupristin and dalfopristin significantly inhibit CYP3A4, which metabolizes warfarin, diazepam, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and cyclosporine, among others. Dosage reduction of cyclosporine may be necessary.

Quinupristin-dalfopristin is approved for treatment of infections caused by staphylococci or by vancomycin-resistant strains of E faecium, but not E faecalis, which is intrinsically resistant probably because of an efflux-type resistance mechanism. The principal toxicities are infusion-related events, such as pain at the infusion site, and an arthralgia-myalgia syndrome.

\section*{OXAZOLI DI NONES}

Linezolid is a member of the oxazolidinones, a new class of synthetic antimicrobials. It is active against gram-positive organisms including staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, gram-positive anaerobic cocci, and gram-positive rods such as corynebacteria and Listeria monocytogenes. It is primarily a bacteriostatic agent except for streptococci, for which it is bactericidal. It is active in vitro against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Linezolid inhibits protein synthesis by preventing formation of the ribosome complex that initiates protein synthesis. Its unique binding site, located on 23 S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit, results in no cross-resistance with other drug classes. Resistance is caused by mutation of the linezolid binding site on 23 S ribosomal RNA.

The principal toxicity of linezolid is hematologic-reversible and generally mild. Thrombocytopenia is the most common manifestation (seen in approximately $3 \%$ of treatment courses), particularly when the drug is administered for longer than 2 weeks. Neutropenia may also occur, most commonly in patients with a predisposition to or underlying bone marrow suppression. Linezolid is 100\% bioavailable after oral administration and has a half-life of $4-6$ hours. It is metabolized by oxidative metabolism, yielding two inactive metabolites. It is neither an inducer nor an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Peak serum concentrations average $18 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ following a $600-\mathrm{mg}$ oral dose. The recommended dosage for most indications is 600 mg twice daily, either orally or intravenously. Linezolid is approved for vancomycin-resistant E faecium infections; nosocomial pneumonia; community-acquired pneumonia; and skin infections, complicated or uncomplicated. It should be reserved for treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria.

\section*{AMI NOGLYCOSI DES \& SPECTI NOMYCI N: I NTRODUCTI ON}

The drugs described in this chapter are bactericidal inhibitors of protein synthesis that interfere with ribosomal function. These agents are useful mainly against aerobic gram-negative microorganisms.

\section*{AMI NOGLYCOSI DES}

The aminoglycosides include streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, sisomicin, netilmicin, and others. They are used most widely against gram-negative enteric bacteria, especially in bacteremia and sepsis, in combination with vancomycin or a penicillin for endocarditis, and for treatment of tuberculosis.

\section*{General Properties of Aminoglycosides}

\section*{PHYSICAL AND CHEMI CAL PROPERTIES}

Aminoglycosides have a hexose ring, either streptidine (in streptomycin) or 2-deoxystreptamine (other aminoglycosides), to which various amino sugars are attached by glycosidic linkages (Figures 45-1 and 45-2). They are water-soluble, stable in solution, and more active at alkaline than at acid pH .

Structures of several important aminoglycoside antibiotics. Ring II is 2-deoxystreptamine. The resemblance between kanamycin and amikacin and between gentamicin, netilmicin, and tobramycin can be seen. The circled numerals on the kanamycin molecule indicate points of attack of plasmid-mediated bacterial transferase enzymes that can inactivate this drug. (1), (2), and (3), acetyltransferase; (4), phosphotransferase; (5), adenylyltransferase. Amikacin is resistant to modification at (2), (3), (4), and (5).

\section*{MECHANISM OF ACTION}

The mode of action of streptomycin has been studied far more closely than that of other aminoglycosides, but probably all act similarly. Aminoglycosides are irreversible inhibitors of protein synthesis, but the precise mechanism for bactericidal activity is not known. The initial event is passive diffusion via porin channels across the outer membrane. Drug is then actively transported across the cell membrane into the cytoplasm by an oxygen-dependent process. The transmembrane electrochemical gradient supplies the energy for this process, and transport is coupled to a proton pump. Low extracellular pH and anaerobic conditions inhibit transport by reducing the gradient. Transport may be enhanced by cell wall-active drugs such as penicillin or vancomycin; this enhancement may be the basis of the synergism of these antibiotics with aminoglycosides.

Inside the cell, aminoglycosides bind to specific 30S-subunit ribosomal proteins (S12 in the case of streptomycin). Protein synthesis is inhibited by aminoglycosides in at least three ways (Figure 45-3): (1) interference with the initiation complex of peptide formation; (2) misreading of mRNA, which causes incorporation of incorrect amino acids into the peptide, resulting in a nonfunctional or toxic protein; and (3) breakup of polysomes into nonfunctional monosomes. These activities occur more or less simultaneously, and the overall effect is irreversible and lethal for the cell.

Figure 45-3.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-1380.jpg?height=1088&width=1191&top_left_y=182&top_left_x=464)

Putative mechanisms of action of the aminoglycosides. Normal protein synthesis is shown in the top panel. At least three aminoglycoside effects have been described, as shown in the bottom panel: block of formation of the initiation complex; miscoding of amino acids in the emerging peptide chain due to misreading of the mRNA; and block of translocation on mRNA. Block of movement of the ribosome may occur after the formation of a single initiation complex, resulting in an mRNA chain with only a single ribosome on it, a so-called monosome.

\section*{MECHANISMS OF RESI STANCE}

Three principal mechanisms have been established: (1) production of a transferase enzyme or enzymes inactivates the aminoglycoside by adenylylation, acetylation, or phosphorylation. This is the principal type of resistance encountered clinically. (Specific transferase enzymes are discussed below.) (2) There is impaired entry of aminoglycoside into the cell. This may be genotypic, ie, resulting from mutation or deletion of a porin protein or proteins involved in transport and maintenance of the electrochemical gradient; or phenotypic, eg, resulting from growth conditions under which the oxygen-dependent transport process described above is not functional. (3) The receptor protein on the 30 S ribosomal subunit may be deleted or altered as a result of a mutation.

\section*{PHARMACOKI NETI CS AND ONCE-DAI LY DOSI NG}

Aminoglycosides are absorbed very poorly from the intact gastrointestinal tract; almost the entire oral dose is excreted in feces after oral administration. However, the drugs may be absorbed if ulcerations are present. After intramuscular injection, aminoglycosides are well absorbed, giving peak concentrations in blood within 30-90 minutes. Aminoglycosides are usually administered
intravenously as a 30- to 60-minute infusion; after a brief distribution phase, this results in serum concentrations that are identical to those following intramuscular injection.

Traditionally, aminoglycosides have been administered in two or three equally divided daily doses for patients with normal renal function. However, once-daily aminoglycoside dosing may be preferred in certain clinical situations. Aminoglycosides have concentration-dependent killing; that is, increasing concentrations kill an increasing proportion of bacteria and at a more rapid rate. They also have a significant postantibiotic effect, such that the antibacterial activity persists beyond the time during which measurable drug is present. The postantibiotic effect of aminoglycosides can reach several hours. Because of these properties, a given total amount of aminoglycoside may have better efficacy when administered as a single large dose than when administered as multiple smaller doses.

Aminoglycoside toxicity is both time- and concentration-dependent. Toxicity is unlikely to occur until a certain threshold concentration is achieved, but once that concentration is achieved the time above this threshold becomes critical. This threshold is not precisely defined, but a trough concentration above $2 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ is predictive of toxicity. At clinically relevant doses, the time above this threshold will be greater with multiple smaller doses of drug than with a single large dose.

Numerous clinical studies demonstrate that a single daily dose of aminoglycoside is just as effective-and no more (and often less) toxic-than multiple smaller doses. Therefore, many authorities now recommend that aminoglycosides be administered as a single daily dose in many clinical situations. The efficacy of once-daily aminoglycoside dosing in combination therapy of enterococcal, streptococcal, and staphylococcal endocarditis remains to be defined, and the standard low-dose, thrice-daily administration is still recommended. The role of once-daily dosing in pregnancy and in neonates also is not well-defined.

Once-daily dosing has potential practical advantages. For example, determination of serum concentrations is probably unnecessary unless aminoglycoside is given for more than 3 days. A drug administered once a day rather than three times a day saves time. And once-a-day dosing lends itself to outpatient therapy.

Once-daily dosing, however, does not eliminate responsibility for careful monitoring and dosage adjustment to minimize toxicity. Selection of the appropriate dose is particularly critical if renal function is impaired. Aminoglycosides are cleared by the kidney, and excretion is directly proportional to creatinine clearance. Rapidly changing renal function, which may occur with acute renal failure in the patient with septic shock, must be anticipated to avoid overdose. Provided these pitfalls are avoided, once-daily aminoglycoside dosing is safe and effective. If the creatinine clearance is 100 $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{min}$, gentamicin is given as a $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ dose ( $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ for amikacin) over $30-60$ minutes. If the creatinine clearance is $80 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, the dose is $4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ( $12 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ for amikacin); if creatinine clearance is $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, the dose is $3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ( $9 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ for amikacin). If the creatinine clearance is less than $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, a $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ gentamicin loading dose is given and subsequent doses are adjusted as would normally be done. Serum concentrations need not be routinely checked until the second or third day of therapy, depending on the stability of renal function and the anticipated duration of therapy. It is probably unnecessary to check peak concentrations, because they will be high. The goal is to administer drug so that concentrations of less than $1 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ are present between 18 and 24 hours after dosing. This provides a sufficient period of time for washout of drug to occur before the
next dose is given. This is most easily determined either by measuring serum concentrations in samples obtained 2 hours and 12 hours after dosing and then adjusting the dose based on the actual clearance of drug or by measuring the concentration in a sample obtained 8 hours after a dose. If the 8-hour concentration is between 1.5 mcg and $6 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$, the target trough will be achieved at 18 hours.

Aminoglycosides are highly polar compounds that do not enter cells readily. They are largely excluded from the central nervous system and the eye. In the presence of active inflammation, however, cerebrospinal fluid levels reach $20 \%$ of plasma levels, and in neonatal meningitis the levels may be higher. Intrathecal or intraventricular injection is required for high levels in cerebrospinal fluid. Even after parenteral administration, concentrations of aminoglycosides are not high in most tissues except the renal cortex. Concentration in most secretions is also modest; in the bile, it may reach $30 \%$ of the blood level. With prolonged therapy, diffusion into pleural or synovial fluid may result in concentrations $50-90 \%$ of that of plasma.

The normal half-life of aminoglycosides in serum is $2-3$ hours, increasing to $24-48$ hours in patients with significant impairment of renal function. Aminoglycosides are only partially and irregularly removed by hemodialysis-eg, 40-60\% for gentamicin-and even less effectively by peritoneal dialysis.

Dosage adjustments must be made to avoid accumulation of drug and toxicity in patients with renal insufficiency. Either the dose of drug is kept constant and the interval between doses is increased, or the interval is kept constant and the dose is reduced. Nomograms and formulas have been constructed relating serum creatinine levels to adjustments in treatment regimens. The simplest formula divides the dose (calculated on the basis of normal renal function) by the serum creatinine value ( $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). Thus, a 60-kg patient with normal renal function might receive $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ of gentamicin (maximum daily dose of $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ), whereas a $60-\mathrm{kg}$ patient with a serum creatinine of 3 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ would receive $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. However, this approach fails to take into account the age and gender of the patient, both of which significantly affect creatinine clearance without necessarily being reflected as a change in serum creatinine. Because aminoglycoside clearance is directly proportional to the creatinine clearance, a better method for determining the aminoglycoside dose is to estimate creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault formula described in Chapter 61.

The daily dosage of aminoglycoside is calculated by multiplying the maximum daily dose by the ratio of estimated creatinine clearance to normal creatinine clearance, ie, $120 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, which is a typical value for a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ young adult male. For a 60 -year-old female weighing 60 kg with a serum creatinine of $3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, the corrected dosage of gentamicin would be approximately $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, half the dose calculated by the simplest formula. There is considerable individual variation in aminoglycoside serum levels among patients with similar estimated creatinine clearance values. Therefore, it is mandatory, especially when using higher dosages for more than a few days or when renal function is rapidly changing, to measure serum drug levels to avoid severe toxicity. For a traditional twice- or thricedaily dosing regimen, peak serum concentrations should be determined from a blood sample obtained 30-60 minutes after a dose and trough concentrations from a sample obtained just before the next dose.

\section*{ADVERSE EFFECTS}

All aminoglycosides are ototoxic and nephrotoxic. Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity are more likely to be
encountered when therapy is continued for more than 5 days, at higher doses, in the elderly, and in the setting of renal insufficiency. Concurrent use with loop diuretics (eg, furosemide, ethacrynic acid) or other nephrotoxic antimicrobial agents (eg, vancomycin or amphotericin) can potentiate nephrotoxicity and should be avoided if possible. Ototoxicity can manifest itself either as auditory damage, resulting in tinnitus and high-frequency hearing loss initially, or as vestibular damage, evident by vertigo, ataxia, and loss of balance. Nephrotoxicity results in rising serum creatinine levels or reduced creatinine clearance, although the earliest indication often is an increase in trough serum aminoglycoside concentrations. Neomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin are the most ototoxic agents. Streptomycin and gentamicin are the most vestibulotoxic. Neomycin, tobramycin, and gentamicin are the most nephrotoxic.

In very high doses, aminoglycosides can produce a curare-like effect with neuromuscular blockade that results in respiratory paralysis. This paralysis is usually reversible by calcium gluconate (given promptly) or neostigmine. Hypersensitivity occurs infrequently.

\section*{CLI NI CAL USES}

Aminoglycosides are mostly used against gram-negative enteric bacteria, especially when the isolate may be drug-resistant and when there is suspicion of sepsis. They are almost always used in combination with a B-lactam antibiotic to extend coverage to include potential gram-positive pathogens and to take advantage of the synergism between these two classes of drugs. Penicillinaminoglycoside combinations also are used to achieve bactericidal activity in treatment of enterococcal endocarditis and to shorten duration of therapy for viridans streptococcal and staphylococcal endocarditis. Which aminoglycoside and what dose should be used depend on the infection being treated and the susceptibility of the isolate.

\section*{STREPTOMYCI N}

Streptomycin (Figure 45-1) was isolated from a strain of Streptomyces griseus. The antimicrobial activity of streptomycin is typical of that of other aminoglycosides, as are the mechanisms of resistance. Resistance has emerged in most species, severely limiting the current usefulness of streptomycin, with the exceptions listed below. Ribosomal resistance to streptomycin develops readily, limiting its role as a single agent.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTIONS}

Streptomycin is mainly used as a second-line agent for treatment of tuberculosis. The dosage is $0.5-1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ ( $7.5-15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ for children), which is given intramuscularly or intravenously. It should be used only in combination with other agents to prevent emergence of resistance. See Chapter 47 for additional information regarding the use of streptomycin in mycobacterial infections.

\section*{NONTUBERCULOUS INFECTIONS}

In plague, tularemia, and sometimes brucellosis, streptomycin, $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ ( $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ for children), is given intramuscularly in combination with an oral tetracycline.

Penicillin plus streptomycin is effective for enterococcal endocarditis and 2-week therapy of viridans streptococcal endocarditis. Gentamicin has largely replaced streptomycin for these indications. Streptomycin remains a useful agent for treating enterococcal infections, however, because approximately $15 \%$ of enterococcal isolates that are resistant to gentamicin (and therefore to
netilmicin, tobramycin, and amikacin) will be susceptible to streptomycin.

\section*{Adverse Reactions}

Fever, skin rashes, and other allergic manifestations may result from hypersensitivity to streptomycin. This occurs most frequently with prolonged contact with the drug either in patients who receive a prolonged course of treatment (eg, for tuberculosis) or in medical personnel who handle the drug. Desensitization is occasionally successful.

Pain at the injection site is common but usually not severe. The most serious toxic effect with streptomycin is disturbance of vestibular function-vertigo and loss of balance. The frequency and severity of this disturbance are in proportion to the age of the patient, the blood levels of the drug, and the duration of administration. Vestibular dysfunction may follow a few weeks of unusually high blood levels (eg, in individuals with impaired renal function) or months of relatively low blood levels. Vestibular toxicity tends to be irreversible. Streptomycin given during pregnancy can cause deafness in the newborn and therefore is relatively contraindicated.

\section*{GENTAMI CI N}

Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside (Figure 45-2) isolated from Micromonospora purpurea. It is effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, and many of its properties resemble those of other aminoglycosides. Sisomicin is very similar to the $\mathrm{C}_{1 \mathrm{a}}$ component of gentamicin.

\section*{Antimicrobial Activity}

Gentamicin sulfate, $2-10 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$, inhibits in vitro many strains of staphylococci and coliforms and other gram-negative bacteria. It is active alone, but also as a synergistic companion with B-lactam antibiotics, against pseudomonas, proteus, enterobacter, klebsiella, serratia, stenotrophomonas, and other gram-negative rods that may be resistant to multiple other antibiotics. Like all aminoglycosides, it has no activity against anaerobes.

\section*{Resistance}

Streptococci and enterococci are relatively resistant to gentamicin owing to failure of the drug to penetrate into the cell. However, gentamicin in combination with vancomycin or a penicillin produces a potent bactericidal effect, which in part is due to enhanced uptake of drug that occurs with inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Resistance to gentamicin rapidly emerges in staphylococci owing to selection of permeability mutants. Ribosomal resistance is rare. Among gram-negative bacteria, resistance is most commonly due to plasmid-encoded aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. Gramnegative bacteria that are gentamicin-resistant usually are susceptible to amikacin, which is much more resistant to modifying enzyme activity. The enterococcal enzyme that modifies gentamicin is a bifunctional enzyme that also inactivates amikacin, netilmicin, and tobramycin, but not streptomycin; the latter is modified by a different enzyme. This is why some gentamicin-resistant enterococci are susceptible to streptomycin.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{INTRAMUSCULAR OR INTRAVENOUS ADMI NISTRATION}

Gentamicin is used mainly in severe infections (eg, sepsis and pneumonia) caused by gram-negative bacteria that are likely to be resistant to other drugs, especially pseudomonas, enterobacter, serratia, proteus, acinetobacter, and klebsiella. It usually is used in combination with a second agent, as an
aminoglycoside alone may not be effective for infections outside the urinary tract. For example, gentamicin should not be used as a single agent to treat staphylococcal infections because resistance develops rapidly. Aminoglycosides should not be used for single-agent therapy of pneumonia because penetration of infected lung tissue is poor and local conditions of low pH and low oxygen tension contribute to poor activity. Gentamicin $5-6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ traditionally is given intravenously in three equal doses, but once-daily administration is just as effective for some organisms and less toxic.

Serum gentamicin concentrations and renal function should be monitored if gentamicin is administered for more than a few days or if renal function is changing (eg, in sepsis, which often is complicated by acute renal failure). For patients receiving dosing every 8 hours, target peak concentrations are $5-10 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$, and trough concentrations should be less than $1-2 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Trough concentrations above $2 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ indicate accumulation of drug and are associated with toxicity; in this case, the dose should be lowered or the interval extended to achieve the target range.

\section*{TOPICAL ADMI NISTRATION}

Creams, ointments, and solutions containing 0.1-0.3\% gentamicin sulfate have been used for the treatment of infected burns, wounds, or skin lesions and the prevention of intravenous catheter infections. Topical gentamicin is partly inactivated by purulent exudates. Ten milligrams can be injected subconjunctivally for treatment of ocular infections.

\section*{I NTRATHECAL ADMI NI STRATION}

Meningitis caused by gram-negative bacteria has been treated by the intrathecal injection of gentamicin sulfate, $1-10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. However, neither intrathecal nor intraventricular gentamicin was beneficial in neonates with meningitis, and intraventricular gentamicin was toxic, raising questions about the utility of this form of therapy. Moreover, the availability of third-generation cephalosporins for gram-negative meningitis has rendered this therapy obsolete in most cases.

\section*{Adverse Reactions}

Nephrotoxicity is usually reversible and mild. It occurs in 5-25\% of patients receiving gentamicin for longer than 3-5 days. Such toxicity requires, at the very least, adjustment of the dosing regimen and should prompt reconsideration of the need for the drug, particularly if there is a less toxic alternative agent. Measurement of gentamicin serum levels is essential. Ototoxicity, which tends to be irreversible, manifests itself mainly as vestibular dysfunction. Loss of hearing can also occur. The incidence of ototoxicity is in part genetically determined, having been linked to point mutations in mitochondrial DNA, and occurs in 1-5\% for patients receiving gentamicin for more than 5 days. Hypersensitivity reactions to gentamicin are uncommon.

\section*{TOBRAMYCI N}

This aminoglycoside (Figure 45-2) has an antibacterial spectrum similar to that of gentamicin. Although there is some cross-resistance between gentamicin and tobramycin, it is unpredictable in individual strains. Separate laboratory susceptibility tests are therefore necessary.

The pharmacokinetic properties of tobramycin are virtually identical to those of gentamicin. The daily dose of tobramycin is $5-6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ intramuscularly or intravenously, traditionally divided into three equal amounts and given every 8 hours. Monitoring blood levels in renal insufficiency is an essential guide to proper dosing.

Tobramycin has almost the same antibacterial spectrum as gentamicin with a few exceptions. Gentamicin is slightly more active against serratia, whereas tobramycin is slightly more active against pseudomonas; Enterococcus faecalis is susceptible to both gentamicin and tobramycin, but E faecium is resistant to tobramycin. Gentamicin and tobramycin are otherwise interchangeable clinically. Gentamicin is much less expensive, however, and is preferred for this reason.

Like other aminoglycosides, tobramycin is ototoxic and nephrotoxic. Nephrotoxicity of tobramycin may be slightly less than that of gentamicin, but the difference is clinically inconsequential.

Tobramycin is also formulated in solution ( 300 mg in 5 mL ) for inhalation for treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lower respiratory tract infections complicating cystic fibrosis. The drug is recommended as a $300-\mathrm{mg}$ dose regardless of the patient's age or weight for administration twice daily in repeated cycles of 28 days on therapy followed by 28 days off therapy. Serum concentrations 1 hour after inhalation average $1 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$; consequently, nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity rarely occur. Caution should be used when administering the tobramycin to patients with preexisting renal, vestibular, or hearing disorders.

\section*{AMI KACI N}

Amikacin is a semisynthetic derivative of kanamycin; it is less toxic than the parent molecule (Figure 45-2). It is resistant to many enzymes that inactivate gentamicin and tobramycin, and it therefore can be used against some microorganisms resistant to the latter drugs. Many gram-negative enteric bacteria, including many strains of proteus, pseudomonas, enterobacter, and serratia, are inhibited by $1-20 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ amikacin in vitro. After injection of 500 mg of amikacin every 12 hours ( 15 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) intramuscularly, peak levels in serum are $10-30 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$.

Strains of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including streptomycin-resistant strains, are usually susceptible to amikacin. Kanamycin-resistant strains may be cross-resistant to amikacin. The dosage of amikacin for tuberculosis is $7.5-15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ as a once-daily or two to three times weekly injection and always in combination with other drugs to which the isolate is susceptible.

Like all aminoglycosides, amikacin is nephrotoxic and ototoxic (particularly for the auditory portion of the eighth nerve). Serum concentrations should be monitored. Target peak serum concentrations for an every- 12 -hours dosing regimen are $20-40 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$, and troughs should be maintained at less than $2 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$.

\section*{NETI LMI CI N}

Netilmicin shares many characteristics with gentamicin and tobramycin. However, the addition of an ethyl group to the 1 -amino position of the 2 -deoxystreptamine ring (ring II, Figure 45-2) sterically protects the netilmicin molecule from enzymatic degradation at the 3-amino (ring II) and 2-hydroxyl (ring III) positions. Consequently, netilmicin may be active against some gentamicin-resistant and tobramycin-resistant bacteria.

The dosage ( $5-7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) and the routes of administration are the same as for gentamicin. It is completely therapeutically interchangeable with gentamicin or tobramycin and has similar toxicities.

\section*{NEOMYCIN \& KANAMYCI N}

Neomycin and kanamycin are closely related. Paromomycin is also a member of this group. All have
similar properties.

\section*{Antimicrobial Activity \& Resistance}

Drugs of the neomycin group are active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and some mycobacteria. Pseudomonas and streptococci are generally resistant. Mechanisms of antibacterial action and resistance are the same as with other aminoglycosides. The widespread use of these drugs in bowel preparation for elective surgery has resulted in the selection of resistant organisms and some outbreaks of enterocolitis in hospitals. Cross-resistance between kanamycin and neomycin is complete.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Drugs of the neomycin group are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. After oral administration, the intestinal flora is suppressed or modified, and the drug is excreted in the feces. Excretion of any absorbed drug is mainly through glomerular filtration into the urine.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Neomycin and kanamycin are now limited to topical and oral use. Neomycin is too toxic for parenteral use. With the advent of more potent and less toxic aminoglycosides, parenteral administration of kanamycin has also been largely abandoned.

\section*{TOPICAL ADMI NISTRATION}

Solutions containing $1-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}$ are used on infected surfaces or injected into joints, the pleural cavity, tissue spaces, or abscess cavities where infection is present. The total amount of drug given in this fashion must be limited to $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ because at higher doses enough drug may be absorbed to produce systemic toxicity. Whether topical application for active infection adds anything to appropriate systemic therapy is questionable. Ointments, often formulated as a neomycin-polymyxinbacitracin combination, can be applied to infected skin lesions or in the nares for suppression of staphylococci but they are largely ineffective.

\section*{ORAL ADMI NISTRATION}

In preparation for elective bowel surgery, 1 g of neomycin is given orally every $6-8$ hours for 1-2 days, often combined with 1 g of erythromycin base. This reduces the aerobic bowel flora with little effect on anaerobes. In hepatic coma, coliform flora can be suppressed by giving 1 g every $6-8$ hours together with reduced protein intake, thus reducing ammonia intoxication. Use of neomycin for hepatic coma has been almost entirely supplanted by lactulose, which is much less toxic. Paromomycin, 1 g every 6 hours orally for 2 weeks, has been effective in intestinal amebiasis (see Chapter 53).

\section*{Adverse Reactions}

All members of the neomycin group have significant nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Auditory function is affected more than vestibular. Deafness has occurred, especially in adults with impaired renal function and prolonged elevation of drug levels.

The sudden absorption of postoperatively instilled kanamycin from the peritoneal cavity ( $3-5 \mathrm{~g}$ ) has resulted in curare-like neuromuscular blockade and respiratory arrest. Calcium gluconate and neostigmine can act as antidotes.

Although hypersensitivity is not common, prolonged application of neomycin-containing ointments to skin and eyes has resulted in severe allergic reactions.

\section*{SPECTI NOMYCI N}

Spectinomycin is an aminocyclitol antibiotic that is structurally related to aminoglycosides. It lacks amino sugars and glycosidic bonds.
<smiles>CNC1C(O)C(NC)C2O[C@]3(O)C(=O)CC(C)OC3OC2C1O</smiles>

Spectinomycin

Spectinomycin is active in vitro against many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, but it is used almost solely as an alternative treatment for drug-resistant gonorrhea or gonorrhea in penicillinallergic patients. The majority of gonococcal isolates are inhibited by $6 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ of spectinomycin. Strains of gonococci may be resistant to spectinomycin, but there is no cross-resistance with other drugs used in gonorrhea. Spectinomycin is rapidly absorbed after intramuscular injection. A single dose of $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ up to a maximum of 2 g is given. There is pain at the injection site and occasionally fever and nausea. Nephrotoxicity and anemia have been observed rarely.

\section*{ANTI FOLATE DRUGS SULFONAMI DES}

\section*{Chemistry}

The basic formula of the sulfonamides and their structural similarity to p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) are shown in Figure 46-1. Sulfonamides with varying physical, chemical, pharmacologic, and antibacterial properties are produced by attaching substituents to the amido group ( $-\mathrm{SO}_{2}-\mathrm{NH}-\mathrm{R}$ ) or the amino group ( $-\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ ) of the sulfanilamide nucleus. Sulfonamides tend to be much more soluble at alkaline than at acid pH. Most can be prepared as sodium salts, which are used for intravenous administration.

Figure 46-1.

Structures of some sulfonamides and p-aminobenzoic acid.

\section*{Antimicrobial Activity}

Sulfonamide-susceptible organisms, unlike mammals, cannot use exogenous folate but must synthesize it from PABA (Figure 46-2). This pathway is thus essential for production of purines and nucleic acid synthesis. Because sulfonamides are structural analogs of PABA, they inhibit dihydropteroate synthase and folate production. Sulfonamides inhibit both gram-positive and gramnegative bacteria, nocardia, Chlamydia trachomatis, and some protozoa. Some enteric bacteria, such as E coli, klebsiella, salmonella, shigella, and enterobacter, are also inhibited. It is interesting that rickettsiae are not inhibited by sulfonamides but are actually stimulated in their growth. Activity is poor against anaerobes.

Figure 46-2.

Actions of sulfonamides and trimethoprim.

Combination of a sulfonamide with an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (trimethoprim or pyrimethamine) provides synergistic activity because of sequential inhibition of folate synthesis (Figure 46-2).

\section*{Resistance}

Mammalian cells (and some bacteria) lack the enzymes required for folate synthesis from PABA and depend on exogenous sources of folate; therefore, they are not susceptible to sulfonamides. Sulfonamide resistance may occur as a result of mutations that (a) cause overproduction of PABA, (b) cause production of a folic acid-synthesizing enzyme that has low affinity for sulfonamides, or (c)
impair permeability to the sulfonamide. Dihydropteroate synthase with low sulfonamide affinity is often encoded on a plasmid that is transmissible and can disseminate rapidly and widely. Sulfonamideresistant dihydropteroate synthase mutants also can emerge under selective pressure.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Sulfonamides can be divided into three major groups: (1) oral, absorbable; (2) oral, nonabsorbable; and (3) topical. The oral, absorbable sulfonamides can be classified as short-, intermediate-, or longacting on the basis of their half-lives (Table 46-1). They are absorbed from the stomach and small intestine and distributed widely to tissues and body fluids (including the central nervous system and cerebrospinal fluid), placenta, and fetus. Protein binding varies from 20\% to over 90\%. Therapeutic concentrations are in the range of $40-100 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ of blood. Blood levels generally peak 2-6 hours after oral administration.

\section*{Table 46-1. Pharmacokinetic Properties of Some Sulfonamides and Trimethoprim.}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Drug & Half-Life & Oral Absorption \\
\hline Sulfonamides & & \\
\hline Sulfacytine & Short & Prompt (peak levels in 1-4 hours) \\
\hline Sulfisoxazole & Short (6 hours) & Prompt \\
\hline Sulfamethizole & Short (9 hours) & Prompt \\
\hline Sulfadiazine & Intermediate (10-17 hours) & Slow (peak levels in 4-8 hours) \\
\hline Sulfamethoxazole & Intermediate (10-12 hours) & Slow \\
\hline Sulfapyridine & Intermediate (17 hours) & Slow \\
\hline Sulfadoxine & Long (7-9 days) & Intermediate \\
\hline Pyrimidines & & \\
\hline Trimethoprim & Intermediate (11 hours) & Prompt \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

A portion of absorbed drug is acetylated or glucuronidated in the liver. Sulfonamides and inactive metabolites are then excreted into the urine, mainly by glomerular filtration. In significant renal failure, the dosage of sulfonamide must be reduced.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Sulfonamides are infrequently used as single agents. Many strains of formerly susceptible species, including meningococci, pneumococci, streptococci, staphylococci, and gonococci, are now resistant. The fixed-drug combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the drug of choice for infections such as Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly P carinii) pneumonia, toxoplasmosis, nocardiosis, and occasionally
other bacterial infections.

\section*{ORAL ABSORBABLE AGENTS}

Sulfisoxazole and sulfamethoxazole are short- to medium-acting agents used almost exclusively to treat urinary tract infections. The usual adult dosage is 1 g of sulfisoxazole four times daily or 1 g of sulfamethoxazole two or three times daily.

Sulfadiazine in combination with pyrimethamine is first-line therapy for treatment of acute toxoplasmosis. The combination of sulfadiazine with pyrimethamine, a potent inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, is synergistic because these drugs block sequential steps in the folate synthetic pathway blockade (Figure 46-2). The dosage of sulfadiazine is 1 g four times daily, with pyrimethamine given as a $75-\mathrm{mg}$ loading dose followed by a $25-\mathrm{mg}$ once-daily dose. Folinic acid, 10 mg orally each day, should also be administered to minimize bone marrow suppression.

Sulfadoxine is the only long-acting sulfonamide currently available in the United States and only as a combination formulation with pyrimethamine (Fansidar), a second-line agent in treatment for malaria (see Chapter 53).

\section*{ORAL NONABSORBABLE AGENTS}

Sulfasalazine (salicylazosulfapyridine) is widely used in ulcerative colitis, enteritis, and other inflammatory bowel disease (see Chapter 63).

\section*{TOPICAL AGENTS}

Sodium sulfacetamide ophthalmic solution or ointment is effective treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis and as adjunctive therapy for trachoma. Another sulfonamide, mafenide acetate, is used topically but can be absorbed from burn sites. The drug and its primary metabolite inhibit carbonic anhydrase and can cause metabolic acidosis, a side effect that limits its usefulness. Silver sulfadiazine is a much less toxic topical sulfonamide and is preferred to mafenide for prevention of infection of burn wounds.

\section*{Adverse Reactions}

All sulfonamides, including antimicrobial sulfas, diuretics, diazoxide, and the sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents, have been considered to be partially cross-allergenic. However, evidence for this is not extensive. The most common adverse effects are fever, skin rashes, exfoliative dermatitis, photosensitivity, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulties referable to the urinary tract (see below). Stevens-Johnson syndrome, although relatively uncommon (ie, less than $1 \%$ of treatment courses), is a particularly serious and potentially fatal type of skin and mucous membrane eruption associated with sulfonamide use. Other unwanted effects include stomatitis, conjunctivitis, arthritis, hematopoietic disturbances (see below), hepatitis, and, rarely, polyarteritis nodosa and psychosis.

\section*{URINARY TRACT DISTURBANCES}

Sulfonamides may precipitate in urine, especially at neutral or acid pH , producing crystalluria, hematuria, or even obstruction. This is rarely a problem with the more soluble sulfonamides (eg, sulfisoxazole). Sulfadiazine when given in large doses, particularly if fluid intake is poor, can cause crystalluria. Crystalluria is treated by administration of sodium bicarbonate to alkalinize the urine and fluids to maintain adequate hydration. Sulfonamides have also been implicated in various types of nephrosis and in allergic nephritis.

\section*{HEMATOPOIETIC DISTURBANCES}

Sulfonamides can cause hemolytic or aplastic anemia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, or leukemoid reactions. Sulfonamides may provoke hemolytic reactions in patients with glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Sulfonamides taken near the end of pregnancy increase the risk of kernicterus in newborns.

\section*{TRI METHOPRI M \& TRI METHOPRI M-SULFAMETHOXAZOLE MI XTURES}

Trimethoprim, a trimethoxybenzylpyrimidine, selectively inhibits bacterial dihydrofolic acid reductase, which converts dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, a step leading to the synthesis of purines and ultimately to DNA (Figure 46-2). Trimethoprim is about 50,000 times less efficient in inhibition of mammalian dihydrofolic acid reductase. Pyrimethamine, another benzylpyrimidine, selectively inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase of protozoa compared with that of mammalian cells. As noted above, trimethoprim or pyrimethamine in combination with a sulfonamide blocks sequential steps in folate synthesis, resulting in marked enhancement (synergism) of the activity of both drugs. The combination often is bactericidal, compared with the bacteriostatic activity of a sulfonamide alone.

Pyrimethamine

\section*{Resistance}

Resistance to trimethoprim can result from reduced cell permeability, overproduction of dihydrofolate reductase, or production of an altered reductase with reduced drug binding. Resistance can emerge by mutation, although more commonly it is due to plasmid-encoded trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductases. These resistant enzymes may be coded within transposons on conjugative plasmids that exhibit a broad host range, accounting for rapid and widespread dissemination of trimethoprim resistance among numerous bacterial species.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Trimethoprim is usually given orally, alone or in combination with sulfamethoxazole, which has a similar half-life. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can also be given intravenously. Trimethoprim is well absorbed from the gut and distributed widely in body fluids and tissues, including cerebrospinal fluid. Because trimethoprim is more lipid-soluble than sulfamethoxazole, it has a larger volume of distribution than the latter drug. Therefore, when 1 part of trimethoprim is given with 5 parts of
sulfamethoxazole (the ratio in the formulation), the peak plasma concentrations are in the ratio of $1: 20$, which is optimal for the combined effects of these drugs in vitro. About $30-50 \%$ of the sulfonamide and $50-60 \%$ of the trimethoprim (or their respective metabolites) are excreted in the urine within 24 hours. The dose should be reduced by half for patients with creatinine clearances of $15-30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$.

Trimethoprim concentrates in prostatic fluid and in vaginal fluid, which are more acidic than plasma. Therefore, it has more antibacterial activity in prostatic and vaginal fluids than many other antimicrobial drugs.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{ORAL TRI METHOPRI M}

Trimethoprim can be given alone ( 100 mg twice daily) in acute urinary tract infections. Most community-acquired organisms tend to be susceptible to the high concentrations that are found in the urine ( $200-600 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ ).

\section*{ORAL TRIMETHOPRIM- SULFAMETHOXAZOLE (TMP-SMZ)}

A combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective treatment for a wide variety of infections including P jiroveci pneumonia, shigellosis, systemic salmonella infections, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, and some nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. It is active against most $S$ aureus strains, both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant, and against respiratory tract pathogens such as the pneumococcus, Haemophilus species, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (but not Mycoplasma pneumoniae). However, the increasing prevalence of strains of E coli (up to $30 \%$ or more) and pneumococci that are resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole must be considered before using this combination for empirical therapy of upper urinary tract infections or pneumonia.

One double-strength tablet (each tablet contains trimethoprim 160 mg plus sulfamethoxazole 800 mg ) given every 12 hours is effective treatment for urinary tract infections and prostatitis. One half of the regular (single-strength) tablet given three times weekly for many months may serve as prophylaxis in recurrent urinary tract infections of some women. One double-strength tablet every 12 hours is effective treatment for infections caused by susceptible strains of shigella and salmonella. The dosage for children treated for shigellosis, urinary tract infection, or otitis media is $8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ trimethoprim and $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ sulfamethoxazole every 12 hours.

Infections with P jiroveci and some other pathogens can be treated orally with high doses of the combination (dosed on the basis of the trimethoprim component at $15-20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) or can be prevented in immunosuppressed patients by one double-strength tablet daily or three times weekly.

\section*{I NTRAVENOUS TRI METHOPRI M-SULFAMETHOXAZOLE}

A solution of the mixture containing 80 mg trimethoprim plus 400 mg sulfamethoxazole per 5 mL diluted in 125 mL of $5 \%$ dextrose in water can be administered by intravenous infusion over 60-90 minutes. It is the agent of choice for moderately severe to severe pneumocystis pneumonia. It may be used for gram-negative bacterial sepsis, including that caused by some multidrug-resistant species such as enterobacter and serratia; shigellosis; typhoid fever; or urinary tract infection caused by a susceptible organism when the patient is unable to take the drug by mouth. The dosage is 10-20 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ of the trimethoprim component.

\section*{ORAL PYRI METHAMI NE WITH SULFONAMI DE}

Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine have been used for treatment of leishmaniasis and toxoplasmosis. In falciparum malaria, the combination of pyrimethamine with sulfadoxine (Fansidar) has been used (see Chapter 53).

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Trimethoprim produces the predictable adverse effects of an antifolate drug, especially megaloblastic anemia, leukopenia, and granulocytopenia. The combination trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may cause all of the untoward reactions associated with sulfonamides. Nausea and vomiting, drug fever, vasculitis, renal damage, and central nervous system disturbances occasionally occur also. Patients with AIDS and pneumocystis pneumonia have a particularly high frequency of untoward reactions to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, especially fever, rashes, leukopenia, diarrhea, elevations of hepatic aminotransferases, hyperkalemia, and hyponatremia.

\section*{DNA GYRASE I NHI BITORS FLUOROQUI NOLONES}

The important quinolones are synthetic fluorinated analogs of nalidixic acid (Figure 46-3). They are active against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Quinolones block bacterial DNA synthesis by inhibiting bacterial topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV. Inhibition of DNA gyrase prevents the relaxation of positively supercoiled DNA that is required for normal transcription and replication. Inhibition of topoisomerase IV interferes with separation of replicated chromosomal DNA into the respective daughter cells during cell division.

Structures of nalidixic acid and some fluoroquinolones.
Earlier quinolones such as nalidixic acid did not achieve systemic antibacterial levels and were useful only for treatment of lower urinary tract infections. Fluorinated derivatives (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and others; Figure 46-3 and Table 46-2) have greatly improved antibacterial activity compared with nalidixic acid and achieve bactericidal levels in blood and tissues.

\section*{Antibacterial Activity}

Fluoroquinolones were originally developed because of their excellent activity against gram-negative aerobic bacteria; they had limited activity against gram-positive organisms. Several newer agents have improved activity against gram-positive cocci. This relative activity against gram-negative versus gram-positive species is useful for classification of these agents. Norfloxacin is the least active of the fluoroquinolones against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) fourfold to eightfold higher than those of ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, lomefloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, and pefloxacin make up a second group of similar agents possessing excellent gram-negative activity and moderate to good activity against gram-positive bacteria. MICs for gram-negative cocci and bacilli, including Enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas, neisseria, haemophilus, and campylobacter, are $1-2 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ and often less. Methicillin-susceptible strains of S aureus are generally susceptible to these fluoroquinolones, but methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci are often resistant. Streptococci and enterococci tend to be less susceptible than staphylococci, and efficacy in infections caused by these organisms is limited. Ciprofloxacin is the most active agent of this group against gram-negatives, P aeruginosa in particular. Levofloxacin, the L isomer of ofloxacin, has superior activity against gram-positive organisms, including $S$ pneumoniae.

Gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin make up a third group of fluoroquinolones with improved activity against gram-positive organisms, particularly $S$ pneumoniae and some staphylococci. Gemifloxacin is active in vitro against ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of $S$ pneumoniae, but in vivo efficacy is unproven. Although MICs of these agents for staphylococci are lower than those of ciprofloxacin (and the other compounds mentioned in the paragraph above) and may fall within the susceptible range, it is not known whether the enhanced activity is sufficient to permit use of these
agents for treatment of infections caused by ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. In general, none of these agents is as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative organisms. Fluoroquinolones also are active against agents of atypical pneumonia (eg, mycoplasmas and chlamydiae) and against intracellular pathogens such as Legionella species and some mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M avium complex. Moxifloxacin also has good activity against anaerobic bacteria. Because of toxicity, gatifloxacin is no longer available in the USA.

\section*{Resistance}

During fluoroquinolone therapy, resistant organisms emerge about once in $10^{7}-10^{9}$, especially among staphylococci, pseudomonas, and serratia. Resistance is due to one or more point mutations in the quinolone binding region of the target enzyme or to a change in the permeability of the organism. Resistance to one fluoroquinolone, particularly if it is of high level, generally confers cross-resistance to all other members of this class.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

After oral administration, the fluoroquinolones are well absorbed (bioavailability of 80-95\%) and distributed widely in body fluids and tissues (Table 46-2). Serum half-lives range from 3 to 10 hours. The relatively long half-lives of levofloxacin, gemifloxacin gatifloxacin, and moxifloxacin permit oncedaily dosing. Oral absorption is impaired by divalent cations, including those in antacids. Serum concentrations of intravenously administered drug are similar to those of orally administered drug. Most fluoroquinolones are eliminated by renal mechanisms, either tubular secretion or glomerular filtration (Table 46-2). Dose adjustment is required for patients with creatinine clearances less than 50 $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{min}$, the exact adjustment depending on the degree of renal impairment and the specific fluoroquinolone being used. Dose adjustment for renal failure is not necessary for moxifloxacin. Nonrenally cleared fluoroquinolones are relatively contraindicated in patients with hepatic failure.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

Fluoroquinolones (other than moxifloxacin, which achieves relatively low urinary levels) are effective in urinary tract infections even when caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, eg, pseudomonas. These agents are also effective for bacterial diarrhea caused by shigella, salmonella, toxigenic E coli, and campylobacter. Fluoroquinolones (except norfloxacin, which does not achieve adequate systemic concentrations) have been used in infections of soft tissues, bones, and joints and in intra-abdominal and respiratory tract infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant organisms such as pseudomonas and enterobacter. Ciprofloxacin is a drug of choice for prophylaxis and treatment of anthrax, although the newer fluoroquinolones are active in vitro and very likely in vivo as well.

Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are effective for gonococcal infection, including disseminated disease and chlamydial urethritis or cervicitis. Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin is occasionally used for treatment of tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infections. They may be suitable for eradication of meningococci from carriers or for prophylaxis of infection in neutropenic patients.

Levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin, so-called respiratory fluoroquinolones, with their enhanced gram-positive activity and activity against atypical pneumonia agents (eg, chlamydia, mycoplasma, and legionella), are effective and used increasingly for treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Fluoroquinolones are extremely well tolerated. The most common effects are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Occasionally, headache, dizziness, insomnia, skin rash, or abnormal liver function tests develop. Photosensitivity has been reported with lomefloxacin and pefloxacin. $\mathrm{QT}_{\mathrm{c}}$ prolongation may occur with gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin. I deally, these agents should be avoided or used with caution in patients with known $\mathrm{QT}_{\mathrm{c}}$ interval prolongation or uncorrected hypokalemia; in those receiving class IA (eg, quinidine or procainamide) or class III antiarrhythmic agents (sotalol, ibutilide, amiodarone); and in patients receiving other agents known to increase the QT $_{\text {c }}$ interval (eg, erythromycin, tricyclic antidepressants). Gatifloxacin has been associated with hyperglycemia in diabetic patients and with hypoglycemia in patients also receiving oral hypoglycemic agents. Because of these serious effects (including some fatalities), gatifloxacin was withdrawn from sales in the USA in 2006; it may be available elsewhere.

Fluoroquinolones may damage growing cartilage and cause an arthropathy. Thus, these drugs are not routinely recommended for patients under 18 years of age. However, the arthropathy is reversible, and there is a growing consensus that fluoroquinolones may be used in children in some cases (eg, for treatment of pseudomonal infections in patients with cystic fibrosis). Tendinitis, a rare complication that has been reported in adults, is potentially more serious because of the risk of tendon rupture. They should be avoided during pregnancy in the absence of specific data documenting their safety.

\section*{ANTI MYCOBACTERI AL DRUGS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Mycobacteria are intrinsically resistant to most antibiotics. Because they grow slowly compared with other bacteria, antibiotics that are most active against growing cells are relatively ineffective. Mycobacterial cells can also be dormant and thus completely resistant to many drugs or killed only very slowly. The lipid-rich mycobacterial cell wall is impermeable to many agents. Mycobacterial species are intracellular pathogens, and organisms residing within macrophages are inaccessible to drugs that penetrate these cells poorly. Finally, mycobacteria are notorious for their ability to develop resistance. Combinations of two or more drugs are required to overcome these obstacles and to prevent emergence of resistance during the course of therapy. The response of mycobacterial infections to chemotherapy is slow, and treatment must be administered for months to years, depending on which drugs are used. The drugs used to treat tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infections, and leprosy are described in this chapter.

\section*{DRUGS USED IN TUBERCULOSI S}

Isoniazid (INH), rifampin (or other rifamycin), pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin are the five first-line agents for treatment of tuberculosis (Table 47-1). Isoniazid and rifampin are the two most active drugs. An isoniazid-rifampin combination administered for 9 months will cure 95-98\% of cases of tuberculosis caused by susceptible strains. The addition of pyrazinamide to an isoniazid-rifampin combination for the first 2 months allows the total duration of therapy to be reduced to 6 months without loss of efficacy (Table 47-2). In practice, therapy is initiated with a fourdrug regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and either ethambutol or streptomycin until susceptibility of the clinical isolate has been determined. Neither ethambutol nor streptomycin adds substantially to the overall activity of the regimen (ie, the duration of treatment cannot be further reduced if either drug is used), but they provide additional coverage if the isolate proves to be resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, or both. The prevalence of isoniazid resistance among US clinical isolates is approximately $10 \%$. Prevalence of resistance to both isoniazid and rifampin (ie, multiple drug resistance) is about $3 \%$.

\section*{I SONI AZI D (I NH)}

Isoniazid is the most active drug for the treatment of tuberculosis caused by susceptible strains. It is small (MW 137) and freely soluble in water. The structural similarity to pyridoxine is shown below.
<smiles>NC(=O)c1ccncc1</smiles>

Isoniazid
<smiles>Cc1ncc(C=O)c(CO)c1O</smiles>

Pyridoxine
In vitro, isoniazid inhibits most tubercle bacilli in a concentration of $0.2 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ or less and is bactericidal for actively growing tubercle bacilli. It is less effective against atypical mycobacterial species. Isoniazid penetrates into macrophages and is active against both extracellular and intracellular organisms.

\section*{Mechanism of Action \& Basis of Resistance}

Isoniazid inhibits synthesis of mycolic acids, which are essential components of mycobacterial cell walls. Isoniazid is a prodrug that is activated by KatG, the mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase. The activated form of isoniazid forms a covalent complex with an acyl carrier protein (AcpM) and KasA, a beta-ketoacyl carrier protein synthetase, which blocks mycolic acid synthesis and kills the cell.

Resistance to isoniazid is associated with mutations resulting in overexpression of inhA, which encodes an NADH-dependent acyl carrier protein reductase; mutation or deletion of the katG gene; promoter mutations resulting in overexpression of ahpC, a putative virulence gene involved in protection of the cell from oxidative stress; and mutations in kasA. Overproducers of inhA express low-level isoniazid resistance and cross-resistance to ethionamide. KatG mutants express high-level isoniazid resistance and often are not cross-resistant to ethionamide.

Drug-resistant mutants are normally present in susceptible mycobacterial populations at about 1 bacillus in $10^{6}$. Since tuberculous lesions often contain more than $10^{8}$ tubercle bacilli, resistant mutants are readily selected out if isoniazid or any other drug is given as a single agent. The use of two independently acting drugs in combination is much more effective. The probability that a bacillus is resistant to both drugs is approximately 1 in $10^{6} \times 10^{6}$, or 1 in $10^{12}$, several orders of magnitude greater than the number of infecting organisms. Thus, at least two (or more in certain cases) active agents should always be used to treat active tuberculosis to prevent emergence of resistance during therapy.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Isoniazid is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. A $300-\mathrm{mg}$ oral dose ( $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ in children) achieves peak plasma concentrations of $3-5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ within $1-2$ hours. Isoniazid diffuses readily into all body fluids and tissues. The concentration in the central nervous system and cerebrospinal fluid ranges between $20 \%$ and $100 \%$ of simultaneous serum concentrations.

Metabolism of isoniazid, especially acetylation by liver N -acetyltransferase, is genetically determined (see Chapter 4). The average plasma concentration of isoniazid in rapid acetylators is about one third to one half of that in slow acetylators, and average half-lives are less than 1 hour and 3 hours, respectively. More rapid clearance of isoniazid by rapid acetylators is usually of no therapeutic consequence when appropriate doses are administered daily, but subtherapeutic concentrations may occur if drug is administered as a once-weekly dose or if there is malabsorption.

Isoniazid metabolites and a small amount of unchanged drug are excreted mainly in the urine. The dose need not be adjusted in renal failure. Dose adjustment is not well defined in patients with severe preexisting hepatic insufficiency (isoniazid is contraindicated if it is the cause of the hepatitis) and should be guided by serum concentrations if a reduction in dose is contemplated.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

The usual dosage of isoniazid is $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$; a typical adult dose is 300 mg given once daily. Up to 10 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ may be used for serious infections or if malabsorption is a problem. A $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ dose, or 900 mg , may be used in a twice-weekly dosing regimen in combination with a second antituberculous agent (eg, rifampin 600 mg ). Pyridoxine, $25-50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, is recommended for those with conditions predisposing to neuropathy, an adverse effect of isoniazid. Isoniazid is usually given by mouth but can be given parenterally in the same dosage.

Isoniazid as a single agent is also indicated for treatment of latent tuberculosis. The dosage is 300 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ( $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) or 900 mg twice weekly for 9 months.

\section*{Adverse Reactions}

The incidence and severity of untoward reactions to isoniazid are related to dosage and duration of
administration.

\section*{IMMUNOLOGIC REACTIONS}

Fever and skin rashes are occasionally seen. Drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported.

\section*{DIRECT TOXI CITY}

Isoniazid-induced hepatitis is the most common major toxic effect. This is distinct from the minor increases in liver aminotransferases (up to three or four times normal), which do not require cessation of the drug and which are seen in 10-20\% of patients, who usually are asymptomatic. Clinical hepatitis with loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain occurs in $1 \%$ of isoniazid recipients and can be fatal, particularly if the drug is not discontinued promptly. There is histologic evidence of hepatocellular damage and necrosis. The risk of hepatitis depends on age. It occurs rarely under age 20, in $0.3 \%$ of those aged 21-35, $1.2 \%$ of those aged 36-50, and $2.3 \%$ for those aged 50 and above. The risk of hepatitis is greater in alcoholics and possibly during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Development of isoniazid hepatitis contraindicates further use of the drug.

Peripheral neuropathy is observed in 10-20\% of patients given dosages greater than $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ but is infrequently seen with the standard 300 mg adult dose. It is more likely to occur in slow acetylators and patients with predisposing conditions such as malnutrition, alcoholism, diabetes, AIDS, and uremia. Neuropathy is due to a relative pyridoxine deficiency. Isoniazid promotes excretion of pyridoxine, and this toxicity is readily reversed by administration of pyridoxine in a dosage as low as $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. Central nervous system toxicity, which is less common, includes memory loss, psychosis, and seizures. These may also respond to pyridoxine.

Miscellaneous other reactions include hematologic abnormalities, provocation of pyridoxine deficiency anemia, tinnitus, and gastrointestinal discomfort. Isoniazid can reduce the metabolism of phenytoin, increasing its blood level and toxicity.

\section*{RIFAMPIN}

Rifampin is a semisynthetic derivative of rifamycin, an antibiotic produced by Streptomyces mediterranei. It is active in vitro against gram-positive and gram-negative cocci, some enteric bacteria, mycobacteria, and chlamydia. Susceptible organisms are inhibited by less than $1 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Resistant mutants are present in all microbial populations at approximately 1 in $10^{6}$ and are rapidly selected out if rifampin is used as a single drug, especially if there is active infection. There is no cross-resistance to other classes of antimicrobial drugs, but there is cross-resistance to other rifamycin derivatives, eg, rifabutin and rifapentine.

\section*{Antimycobacterial Activity, Resistance, \& Pharmacokinetics}

Rifampin binds to the Bsubunit of bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and thereby inhibits RNA synthesis. Resistance results from any one of several possible point mutations in rpoB, the gene for the Bsubunit of RNA polymerase. These mutations result in reduced binding of rifampin to RNA polymerase. Human RNA polymerase does not bind rifampin and is not inhibited by it. Rifampin is bactericidal for mycobacteria. It readily penetrates most tissues and into phagocytic cells. It can kill organisms that are poorly accessible to many other drugs, such as intracellular organisms and those sequestered in abscesses and lung cavities.

Rifampin is well absorbed after oral administration and excreted mainly through the liver into bile. It then undergoes enterohepatic recirculation, with the bulk excreted as a deacylated metabolite in feces and a small amount in the urine. Dosage adjustment for renal or hepatic insufficiency is not necessary. Usual doses result in serum levels of $5-7 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Rifampin is distributed widely in body fluids and tissues. Rifampin is relatively highly protein-bound, and adequate cerebrospinal fluid concentrations are achieved only in the presence of meningeal inflammation.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTIONS}

Rifampin, usually $600 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ( $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) orally, must be administered with isoniazid or other antituberculous drugs to patients with active tuberculosis to prevent emergence of drug-resistant mycobacteria. In some short-course therapies, 600 mg of rifampin are given twice weekly. Rifampin 600 mg daily or twice weekly for 6 months also is effective in combination with other agents in some atypical mycobacterial infections and in leprosy. Rifampin, 600 mg daily for 4 months as a single drug, is an alternative to isoniazid prophylaxis for patients with latent tuberculosis only who are unable to take isoniazid or who have had exposure to a case of active tuberculosis caused by an isoniazid-resistant, rifampin-susceptible strain.

\section*{OTHER INDICATIONS}

Rifampin has other uses. An oral dosage of 600 mg twice daily for 2 days can eliminate meningococcal carriage. Rifampin, $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ for 4 days, is used as prophylaxis in contacts of children with Haemophilus influenzae type b disease. Rifampin combined with a second agent is used to eradicate staphylococcal carriage. Rifampin combination therapy is also indicated for treatment of serious staphylococcal infections such as osteomyelitis and prosthetic valve endocarditis.

\section*{Adverse Reactions}

Rifampin imparts a harmless orange color to urine, sweat, tears, and contact lenses (soft lenses may be permanently stained). Occasional adverse effects include rashes, thrombocytopenia, and nephritis. It may cause cholestatic jaundice and occasionally hepatitis. Rifampin commonly causes light-chain proteinuria. If administered less often than twice weekly, rifampin causes a flu-like syndrome characterized by fever, chills, myalgias, anemia, and thrombocytopenia and sometimes is associated with acute tubular necrosis. Rifampin strongly induces most cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYPs 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4), which increases the elimination of numerous other drugs including methadone, anticoagulants, cyclosporine, some anticonvulsants, protease inhibitors, some nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, contraceptives, and a host of others. Administration of rifampin results in significantly lower serum levels of these drugs.

\section*{ETHAMBUTOL}

Ethambutol is a synthetic, water-soluble, heat-stable compound, the dextro-isomer of the structure shown below, dispensed as the dihydrochloride salt.
<smiles>CCC(CO)NCCNC(C)CO</smiles>

\section*{Ethambutol}

Susceptible strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacteria are inhibited in vitro by ethambutol, $1-5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Ethambutol inhibits mycobacterial arabinosyl transferases, which are encoded by the embCAB operon. Arabinosyl transferases are involved in the polymerization reaction of arabinoglycan, an essential component of the mycobacterial cell wall. Resistance to ethambutol is due to mutations resulting in overexpression of emb gene products or within the embB structural gene.

Ethambutol is well absorbed from the gut. After ingestion of $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, a blood level peak of 2-5 $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ is reached in $2-4$ hours. About $20 \%$ of the drug is excreted in feces and $50 \%$ in urine in unchanged form. Ethambutol accumulates in renal failure, and the dose should be reduced by half if creatinine clearance is less than $10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. Ethambutol crosses the blood-brain barrier only if the meninges are inflamed. Concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid are highly variable, ranging from $4 \%$ to $64 \%$ of serum levels in the setting of meningeal inflammation.

As with all antituberculous drugs, resistance to ethambutol emerges rapidly when the drug is used alone. Therefore, ethambutol is always given in combination with other antituberculous drugs.

\section*{Clinical Use}

Ethambutol hydrochloride, $15-25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, is usually given as a single daily dose in combination with isoniazid or rifampin. The higher dose is recommended for treatment of tuberculous meningitis. The dose of ethambutol is $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ when a twice-weekly dosing schedule is used.

\section*{Adverse Reactions}

Hypersensitivity to ethambutol is rare. The most common serious adverse event is retrobulbar neuritis, resulting in loss of visual acuity and red-green color blindness. This dose-related side effect is more likely to occur at doses of $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ continued for several months. At $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ or less, visual disturbances are very rare. Periodic visual acuity testing is desirable if the $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ dosage is used. Ethambutol is relatively contraindicated in children too young to permit assessment of visual acuity and red-green color discrimination.

\section*{PYRAZI NAMI DE}

Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a relative of nicotinamide, stable, and slightly soluble in water. It is inactive at neutral pH, but at pH 5.5 it inhibits tubercle bacilli and some other mycobacteria at concentrations of approximately $20 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. The drug is taken up by macrophages and exerts its activity against mycobacteria residing within the acidic environment of lysosomes.

Pyrazinamide is converted to pyrazinoic acid—the active form of the drug-by mycobacterial pyrazinamidase, which is encoded by pncA. The drug target and mechanism of action are unknown. Resistance may be due to impaired uptake of pyrazinamide or mutations in pncA that impair conversion of pyrazinamide to its active form.
<smiles>NC(=O)c1cnccn1</smiles>

Pyrazinamide (PZA)

\section*{Clinical Use}

Serum concentrations of $30-50 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ at $1-2$ hours after oral administration are achieved with dosages of $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. Pyrazinamide is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and widely distributed in body tissues, including inflamed meninges. The half-life is $8-11$ hours. The parent compound is metabolized by the liver, but metabolites are renally cleared; therefore, pyrazinamide should be administered at $25-35 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ three times weekly (not daily) in hemodialysis patients and those in whom the creatinine clearance is less than $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. In patients with normal renal function, a dose of $40-50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ is used for thrice-weekly or twice-weekly treatment regimens. Pyrazinamide is an important front-line drug used in conjunction with isoniazid and rifampin in shortcourse (ie, 6-month) regimens as a "sterilizing" agent active against residual intracellular organisms that may cause relapse. Tubercle bacilli develop resistance to pyrazinamide fairly readily, but there is no cross-resistance with isoniazid or other antimycobacterial drugs.

\section*{Adverse Reactions}

Major adverse effects of pyrazinamide include hepatotoxicity (in 1-5\% of patients), nausea, vomiting, drug fever, and hyperuricemia. The latter occurs uniformly and is not a reason to halt therapy. Hyperuricemia may provoke acute gouty arthritis.

\section*{STREPTOMYCI N}

The mechanism of action and other pharmacologic features of streptomycin are discussed in Chapter 45. The typical adult dose is $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ ( $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ). If the creatinine clearance is less than $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ or the patient is on hemodialysis, the dose is $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ two or three times a week. Most tubercle bacilli are inhibited by streptomycin, $1-10 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$, in vitro. Nontuberculosis species of mycobacteria other than Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and Mycobacterium kansasii are resistant. All large populations of tubercle bacilli contain some streptomycin-resistant mutants. On average, 1 in $10^{8}$ tubercle bacilli can be expected to be resistant to streptomycin at levels of $10-100 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Resistance is due to a point mutation in either the rpsL gene encoding the S12 ribosomal protein gene or the rrs gene encoding 16 S ribosomal rRNA, which alters the ribosomal binding site.

Streptomycin penetrates into cells poorly and is active mainly against extracellular tubercle bacilli. Streptomycin crosses the blood-brain barrier and achieves therapeutic concentrations with inflamed meninges.

\section*{Clinical Use in Tuberculosis}

Streptomycin sulfate is used when an injectable drug is needed or desirable, principally in individuals with severe, possibly life-threatening forms of tuberculosis, eg, meningitis and disseminated disease, and in treatment of infections resistant to other drugs. The usual dosage is $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ intramuscularly or intravenously daily for adults ( $20-40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$, not to exceed $1-1.5 \mathrm{~g}$ for children)
for several weeks, followed by 1-1.5 g two or three times weekly for several months. Serum concentrations of approximately $40 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ are achieved $30-60$ minutes after intramuscular injection of a $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ dose. Other drugs are always given in combination to prevent emergence of resistance.

\section*{Adverse Reactions}

Streptomycin is ototoxic and nephrotoxic. Vertigo and hearing loss are the most common side effects and may be permanent. Toxicity is dose-related, and the risk is increased in the elderly. As with all aminoglycosides, the dose must be adjusted according to renal function (see Chapter 45). Toxicity can be reduced by limiting therapy to no more than 6 months whenever possible.

\section*{ALTERNATIVE SECOND-LINE DRUGS FOR TUBERCULOSIS}

The alternative drugs listed below are usually considered only (1) in case of resistance to first-line agents; (2) in case of failure of clinical response to conventional therapy; (3) in case of serious treatment-limiting adverse drug reactions; and (4) when expert guidance is available to deal with the toxic effects. For many of the second-line drugs listed in the following text, the dosage, emergence of resistance, and long-term toxicity have not been fully established.

\section*{Ethionamide}

Ethionamide is chemically related to isoniazid and also blocks the synthesis of mycolic acids. It is poorly water-soluble and available only in oral form. It is metabolized by the liver.
<smiles>CCCCCCc1cc(C(N)=S)ccn1</smiles>

Ethionamide

Most tubercle bacilli are inhibited in vitro by ethionamide, $2.5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ or less. Some other species of mycobacteria also are inhibited by ethionamide, $10 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Serum concentrations in plasma and tissues of approximately $20 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ are achieved by a dosage of $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations are equal to those in serum.

Ethionamide is administered at an initial dose of 250 mg once daily, which is increased in 250 -mg increments to the recommended dosage of $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ (or $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ), if possible. The $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ dosage, although theoretically desirable, is poorly tolerated because of the intense gastric irritation and neurologic symptoms that commonly occur, and one often must settle for a total daily dose of $500-750 \mathrm{mg}$. Ethionamide is also hepatotoxic. Neurologic symptoms may be alleviated by pyridoxine.

Resistance to ethionamide as a single agent develops rapidly in vitro and in vivo. There can be lowlevel cross-resistance between isoniazid and ethionamide.

\section*{Capreomycin}

Capreomycin is a peptide protein synthesis inhibitor antibiotic obtained from Streptomyces capreolus. Daily injection of 1 g intramuscularly results in blood levels of $10 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ or more. Such
concentrations in vitro are inhibitory for many mycobacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains of M tuberculosis.

Capreomycin ( $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) is an important injectable agent for treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Strains of M tuberculosis that are resistant to streptomycin or amikacin (eg, the multidrug-resistant W strain) usually are susceptible to capreomycin. Resistance to capreomycin, when it occurs, may be due to an rrs mutation.

Capreomycin is nephrotoxic and ototoxic. Tinnitus, deafness, and vestibular disturbances occur. The injection causes significant local pain, and sterile abscesses may occur.

Dosing of capreomycin is the same as that of streptomycin. Toxicity is reduced if 1 g is given two or three times weekly after an initial response has been achieved with a daily dosing schedule.

\section*{Cycloserine}

Cycloserine is an inhibitor of cell wall synthesis and is discussed in Chapter 43. Concentrations of $15-20 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ inhibit many strains of M tuberculosis. The dosage of cycloserine in tuberculosis is $0.5-1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ in two divided doses. Cycloserine is cleared renally, and the dose should be reduced by half if creatinine clearance is less than $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$.

The most serious toxic effects are peripheral neuropathy and central nervous system dysfunction, including depression and psychotic reactions. Pyridoxine $150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ should be given with cycloserine because this ameliorates neurologic toxicity. Adverse effects, which are most common during the first 2 weeks of therapy, occur in $25 \%$ or more of patients, especially at higher doses. Side effects can be minimized by monitoring peak serum concentrations. The peak concentration is reached $2-4$ hours after dosing. The recommended range of peak concentrations is $20-40 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$.

\section*{Aminosalicylic Acid (PAS)}

Aminosalicylic acid is a folate synthesis antagonist that is active almost exclusively against M tuberculosis. It is structurally similar to p-aminobenzoic aid (PABA) and to the sulfonamides (see Chapter 46).
<smiles>Nc1ccc(C(=O)O)c(O)c1</smiles>

\section*{Aminosalicylic acid (PAS)}

Tubercle bacilli are usually inhibited in vitro by aminosalicylic acid, $1-5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Aminosalicylic acid is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Serum levels are $50 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ or more after a $4-\mathrm{g}$ oral dose. The dosage is $8-12 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ orally for adults and $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ for children. The drug is widely distributed in tissues and body fluids except the cerebrospinal fluid. Aminosalicylic acid is rapidly excreted in the urine, in part as active aminosalicylic acid and in part as the acetylated compound and other metabolic products. Very high concentrations of aminosalicylic acid are reached in the urine, which can result in crystalluria.

Aminosalicylic acid is used infrequently now because other oral drugs are better tolerated. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common and may be diminished by giving the drug with meals and with antacids. Peptic ulceration and hemorrhage may occur. Hypersensitivity reactions manifested by fever, joint pains, skin rashes, hepatosplenomegaly, hepatitis, adenopathy, and granulocytopenia often occur after 3-8 weeks of aminosalicylic acid therapy, making it necessary to stop aminosalicylic acid administration temporarily or permanently.

\section*{Kanamycin \& Amikacin}

The aminoglycoside antibiotics are discussed in Chapter 45. Kanamycin has been used for treatment of tuberculosis caused by streptomycin-resistant strains, but the availability of less toxic alternatives (eg, capreomycin and amikacin) has rendered it obsolete.

The role of amikacin in treatment of tuberculosis has increased with the increasing incidence and prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Prevalence of amikacin-resistant strains is low (less than $5 \%$ ), and most multidrug-resistant strains remain amikacin-susceptible. M tuberculosis is inhibited at concentrations of $1 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ or less. Amikacin is also active against atypical mycobacteria. There is no cross-resistance between streptomycin and amikacin, but kanamycin resistance often indicates resistance to amikacin as well. Serum concentrations of $30-50 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ are achieved $30-60$ minutes after a $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ intravenous infusion. Amikacin is indicated for treatment of tuberculosis suspected or known to be caused by streptomycin-resistant or multidrug-resistant strains. Amikacin must be used in combination with at least one and preferably two or three other drugs to which the isolate is susceptible for treatment of drug-resistant cases. The recommended dosages are the same as that for streptomycin.

\section*{Fluoroquinolones}

In addition to their activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (discussed in Chapter 46), ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, and moxifloxacin inhibit strains of M tuberculosis at concentrations less than $2 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. They are also active against atypical mycobacteria. Moxifloxacin is the most active against M tuberculosis by weight in vitro. Levofloxacin tends to be slightly more active than ciprofloxacin against M tuberculosis, whereas ciprofloxacin is slightly more active against atypical mycobacteria.

Fluoroquinolones are an important addition to the drugs available for tuberculosis, especially for strains that are resistant to first-line agents. Resistance, which may result from any one of several single point mutations in the gyrase A subunit, develops rapidly if a fluoroquinolone is used as a single agent; thus, the drug must be used in combination with two or more other active agents. The standard dosage of ciprofloxacin is 750 mg orally twice a day. The dosage of levofloxacin is 500-750 mg once a day. The dosage of moxifloxacin is 400 mg once a day.

\section*{Linezolid}

Linezolid (discussed in Chapter 44) inhibits strains of M tuberculosis in vitro at concentrations of 4 to $8 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. It achieves good intracellular concentrations, and it is active in murine models of tuberculosis. Linezolid has been used in combination with other second- and third-line drugs to treat patients with tuberculosis caused by multidrug-resistant strains. Conversion of sputum cultures to negative was associated with linezolid use in these cases, and some may have been cured. Significant and at times treatment-limiting adverse effects, including bone marrow suppression and irreversible
peripheral and optic neuropathy, have been reported with the prolonged courses of therapy that are necessary for treatment of tuberculosis. A $600-\mathrm{mg}$ (adult) dose administered once a day (half of that used for treatment of other bacterial infections) seems to be sufficient and may limit the occurrence of these adverse effects. Although linezolid may eventually prove to be an important new agent for treatment of tuberculosis, at this point it should be considered a drug of last resort for infection caused by multidrug-resistant strains that also are resistant to several other first- and second-line agents.

\section*{Rifabutin (Ansamycin)}

Rifabutin is derived from rifamycin and is related to rifampin. It has significant activity against M tuberculosis, M avium-intracellulare, and M fortuitum (see below). Its activity is similar to that of rifampin, and cross-resistance with rifampin is virtually complete. Some rifampin-resistant strains may appear susceptible to rifabutin in vitro, but a clinical response is unlikely because the molecular basis of resistance, rpoB mutation, is the same. Rifabutin is both substrate and inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Because it is a less potent inducer, rifabutin is indicated in place of rifampin for treatment of tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients who are receiving concurrent antiretroviral therapy with a protease inhibitor or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (eg, efavirenz) - drugs that also are cytochrome P450 substrates.

The usual dose of rifabutin is $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ unless the patient is receiving a protease inhibitor, in which case the dose should be reduced to $150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. If efavirenz (also a P450 inducer) is used, the recommended dose of rifabutin is $450 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$.

Rifabutin is effective in prevention and treatment of disseminated atypical mycobacterial infection in AIDS patients with CD4 counts below 50/H. It is also effective for preventive therapy of tuberculosis, either alone in a 3-4 month regimen or with pyrazinamide in a 2-month regimen.

\section*{Rifapentine}

Rifapentine is an analog of rifampin. It is active against both M tuberculosis and M avium. As with all rifamycins, it is a bacterial RNA polymerase inhibitor, and cross-resistance between rifampin and rifapentine is complete. Like rifampin, rifapentine is a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes, and it has the same drug interaction profile. Toxicity is similar to that of rifampin. Rifapentine and its microbiologically active metabolite, 25-desacetylrifapentine, have an elimination half-life of 13 hours. Rifapentine 600 mg ( $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) once weekly is indicated for treatment of tuberculosis caused by rifampin-susceptible strains during the continuation phase only (ie, after the first 2 months of therapy and ideally after conversion of sputum cultures to negative). Rifapentine should not be used to treat HIV-infected patients because of an unacceptably high relapse rate with rifampin-resistant organisms.

\section*{DRUGS ACTI VE AGAI NST ATYPI CAL MYCOBACTERI A}

About 10\% of mycobacterial infections seen in clinical practice in the USA are caused not by M tuberculosis or M tuberculosis complex organisms, but by nontuberculous or so-called "atypical" mycobacteria. These organisms have distinctive laboratory characteristics, are present in the environment, and are not communicable from person to person. As a rule, these mycobacterial species are less susceptible than M tuberculosis to antituberculous drugs. On the other hand, agents
such as erythromycin, sulfonamides, or tetracycline, which are not active against M tuberculosis, may be effective for infections caused by atypical strains. Emergence of resistance during therapy is also a problem with these mycobacterial species, and active infection should be treated with combinations of drugs. M kansasii is susceptible to rifampin and ethambutol, partially resistant to isoniazid, and completely resistant to pyrazinamide. A three-drug combination of isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol is the conventional treatment for M kansasii infection. A few representative pathogens, with the clinical presentation and the drugs to which they are often susceptible, are given in Table 47-3.

Table 47-3. Clinical Features and Treatment Options for Infections with Atypical Mycobacteria.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Species & Clinical Features & Treatment Options \\
\hline M kansasii & Resembles tuberculosis & Ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole \\
\hline M marinum & Granulomatous cutaneous disease & Amikacin, clarithromycin, ethambutol, doxycycline, minocycline, rifampin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole \\
\hline M scrofulaceum & Cervical adenitis in children & Amikacin, erythromycin (or other macrolide), rifampin, streptomycin (Surgical excision is often curative and the treatment of choice.) \\
\hline M avium complex & Pulmonary disease in patients with chronic lung disease; disseminated infection in AIDS & Amikacin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ethambutol, rifabutin \\
\hline M chelonae & Abscess, sinus tract, ulcer; bone, joint, tendon infection & Amikacin, doxycycline, imipenem, macrolides, tobramycin \\
\hline M fortuitum & Abscess, sinus tract, ulcer; bone, joint, tendon infection & Amikacin, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, ofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole \\
\hline M ulcerans & Skin ulcers & Isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, minocycline (Surgical excision may be effective.) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

M avium complex, which includes both M avium and M intracellulare, is an important and common cause of disseminated disease in late stages of AIDS (CD4 counts < 50/H L). M avium complex is much less susceptible than M tuberculosis to most antituberculous drugs. Combinations of agents are required to suppress the disease. Azithromycin, 500 mg once daily, or clarithromycin, 500 mg twice daily, plus ethambutol, $15-25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$, is an effective and well-tolerated regimen for treatment of disseminated disease. Some authorities recommend use of a third agent, such as ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice daily or rifabutin, 300 mg once daily. Other agents that may be useful are listed in Table

47-3. Rifabutin in a single daily dose of 300 mg has been shown to reduce the incidence of M avium complex bacteremia in AIDS patients with CD4 less than 100/H. Clarithromycin also effectively prevents MAC bacteremia in AIDS patients, but if breakthrough bacteremia occurs, the isolate often is resistant to both clarithromycin and azithromycin, precluding the use of the most effective drugs for treatment.

\section*{DRUGS USED IN LEPROSY}

Mycobacterium leprae has never been grown in vitro, but animal models, such as growth in injected mouse footpads, have permitted laboratory evaluation of drugs. Only those drugs that have the widest clinical use are presented here. Because of increasing reports of dapsone resistance, treatment of leprosy with combinations of the drugs listed below is recommended.

\section*{DAPSONE \& OTHER SULFONES}

Several drugs closely related to the sulfonamides have been used effectively in the long-term treatment of leprosy. The most widely used is dapsone (diaminodiphenylsulfone). Like the sulfonamides, it inhibits folate synthesis. Resistance can emerge in large populations of M leprae, eg, in lepromatous leprosy, if very low doses are given. Therefore, the combination of dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine is recommended for initial therapy. Dapsone may also be used to prevent and treat Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in AIDS patients.
<smiles>Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)c2ccc(N)cc2)cc1</smiles>

Sulfones are well absorbed from the gut and widely distributed throughout body fluids and tissues. Dapsone's half-life is 1-2 days, and drug tends to be retained in skin, muscle, liver, and kidney. Skin heavily infected with M leprae may contain several times more drug than normal skin. Sulfones are excreted into bile and reabsorbed in the intestine. Excretion into urine is variable, and most excreted drug is acetylated. In renal failure, the dose may have to be adjusted. The usual adult dosage in leprosy is 100 mg daily. For children, the dose is proportionately less depending on weight.

Dapsone is usually well tolerated. Many patients develop some hemolysis, particularly if they have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Methemoglobinemia is common, but usually is not a problem clinically. Gastrointestinal intolerance, fever, pruritus, and various rashes occur. During dapsone therapy of lepromatous leprosy, erythema nodosum leprosum often develops. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish reactions to dapsone from manifestations of the underlying illness. Erythema nodosum leprosum may be suppressed by corticosteroids or by thalidomide.

\section*{RIFAMPIN}

Rifampin (see earlier discussion) in a dosage of 600 mg daily is highly effective in lepromatous leprosy. Because of the probable risk of emergence of rifampin-resistant M leprae, the drug is given in combination with dapsone or another antileprosy drug. A single monthly dose of 600 mg may be beneficial in combination therapy.

\section*{CLOFAZI MI NE}

Clofazimine is a phenazine dye that can be used as an alternative to dapsone. Its mechanism of action is unknown but may involve DNA binding.

Absorption of clofazimine from the gut is variable, and a major portion of the drug is excreted in feces. Clofazimine is stored widely in reticuloendothelial tissues and skin, and its crystals can be seen inside phagocytic reticuloendothelial cells. It is slowly released from these deposits, so that the serum half-life may be 2 months.

Clofazimine is given for sulfone-resistant leprosy or when patients are intolerant to sulfones. A common dosage is $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ orally. The most prominent untoward effect is skin discoloration ranging from red-brown to nearly black. Gastrointestinal intolerance occurs occasionally.

\section*{ANTI FUNGAL AGENTS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Human fungal infections have increased dramatically in incidence and severity in recent years, owing mainly to advances in surgery, cancer treatment, and critical care accompanied by increases in the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials and the HIV epidemic. These changes have resulted in increased numbers of patients at risk for fungal infections.

Pharmacotherapy of fungal disease has been revolutionized by the introduction of the relatively nontoxic oral azole drugs and the echinocandins. Combination therapy is being reconsidered, and new formulations of old agents are becoming available. Unfortunately, the appearance of azole-resistant organisms, as well as the rise in the number of patients at risk for mycotic infections, has created new challenges.

The antifungal drugs presently available fall into several categories: systemic drugs (oral or parenteral) for systemic infections, oral drugs for mucocutaneous infections, and topical drugs for mucocutaneous infections.

\section*{SYSTEMI C ANTI FUNGAL DRUGS FOR SYSTEMI C I NFECTI ONS AMPHOTERI CI N B}

Amphotericin A and B are antifungal antibiotics produced by Streptomyces nodosus. Amphotericin A is not in clinical use.

\section*{Chemistry}

Amphotericin B is an amphoteric polyene macrolide (polyene $=$ containing many double bonds; macrolide $=$ containing a large lactone ring of 12 or more atoms). It is nearly insoluble in water and is therefore prepared as a colloidal suspension of amphotericin B and sodium desoxycholate for intravenous injection. Several new formulations have been developed in which amphotericin B is packaged in a lipid-associated delivery system (Table 48-1 and Liposomal Amphotericin B).

\section*{LI POSOMAL AMPHOTERI CI N B}

Therapy with amphotericin B is often limited by toxicity, especially drug-induced renal impairment. This has led to the development of lipid drug formulations on the assumption that lipid-packaged drug binds to the mammalian membrane less readily, permitting the use of effective doses of the drug with lower toxicity. Liposomal amphotericin preparations package the active drug in lipid delivery vehicles, in contrast to the colloidal suspensions, which were previously the only available forms. Amphotericin binds to the lipids in these vehicles with an affinity between that for fungal ergosterol and that for human cholesterol. The lipid vehicle then serves as an amphotericin reservoir, reducing nonspecific binding to human cell membranes. This preferential binding allows for a reduction of toxicity without sacrificing efficacy and permits use of larger doses. Furthermore, some fungi contain lipases that may liberate free amphotericin B directly at the site of infection.

Three such formulations are now available and have differing pharmacologic properties as summarized in Table 48-1. Although clinical trials have demonstrated different renal and infusion-related toxicities for these preparations compared with regular amphotericin B, there are no trials comparing the different formulations with each other. Limited studies have suggested at best a moderate improvement in the clinical efficacy of the lipid formulations compared with conventional amphotericin B. Because the lipid preparations are much more expensive, their use is usually restricted to patients intolerant to, or not responding to, conventional amphotericin treatment.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Amphotericin B is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Oral amphotericin B is thus effective only on fungi within the lumen of the tract and cannot be used for treatment of systemic disease. The intravenous injection of $0.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ of amphotericin B results in average blood levels of $0.3-1 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$; the drug is more than $90 \%$ bound by serum proteins. Although it is mostly metabolized, some amphotericin $B$ is excreted slowly in the urine over a period of several days. The serum $t_{1 / 2}$ is approximately 15 days. Hepatic impairment, renal impairment, and dialysis have little impact on drug concentrations, and therefore no dose adjustment is required. The drug is widely distributed in most tissues, but only $2-3 \%$ of the blood level is reached in cerebrospinal fluid, thus occasionally necessitating intrathecal therapy for certain types of fungal meningitis.

Mechanism of Action

Amphotericin B is selective in its fungicidal effect because it exploits the difference in lipid composition of fungal and mammalian cell membranes. Ergosterol, a cell membrane sterol, is found in the cell membrane of fungi, whereas the predominant sterol of bacteria and human cells is cholesterol. Amphotericin B binds to ergosterol and alters the permeability of the cell by forming amphotericin B-associated pores in the cell membrane. As suggested by its chemistry, amphotericin B combines avidly with lipids (ergosterol) along the double bond-rich side of its structure and associates with water molecules along the hydroxyl-rich side. This amphipathic characteristic facilitates pore formation by multiple amphotericin molecules, with the lipophilic portions around the outside of the pore and the hydrophilic regions lining the inside. The pore allows the leakage of intracellular ions and macromolecules, eventually leading to cell death. Some binding to human membrane sterols does occur, probably accounting for the drug's prominent toxicity.

Resistance to amphotericin B occurs if ergosterol binding is impaired, either by decreasing the membrane concentration of ergosterol or by modifying the sterol target molecule to reduce its affinity for the drug.

\section*{Antifungal Activity}

Amphotericin B remains the antifungal agent with the broadest spectrum of action. It has activity against the clinically significant yeasts, including Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans; the organisms causing endemic mycoses, including Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis, and Coccidioides immitis; and the pathogenic molds, such as Aspergillus fumigatus and mucor. Some fungal organisms such as Candida lusitaniae and Pseudallescheria boydii display intrinsic amphotericin B resistance.

\section*{Clinical Use}

Owing to its broad spectrum of activity and fungicidal action, amphotericin B remains a useful agent for nearly all life-threatening mycotic infections, although newer less toxic agents have begun to replace amphotericin B for many conditions. It is often used as the initial induction regimen for serious fungal infections and is then replaced by one of the newer azole drugs (described below) for chronic therapy or prevention of relapse. Such induction therapy is especially important for immunosuppressed patients and those with severe fungal pneumonia, cryptococcal meningitis with altered mental status, or sepsis syndrome due to fungal infection. Once a clinical response has been elicited, these patients then often continue maintenance therapy with an azole; therapy may be lifelong in patients at high risk for disease relapse. Amphotericin has also been used as empiric therapy for selected patients in whom the risks of leaving a systemic fungal infection untreated are high. The most common such patient is the cancer patient with neutropenia who remains febrile on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

For treatment of systemic fungal disease, amphotericin B is given by slow intravenous infusion at a dosage of $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. It is usually continued to a defined total dose ( $\mathrm{eg}, 1-2 \mathrm{~g}$ ), rather than a defined time span, as used with other antimicrobial drugs.

Intrathecal therapy for fungal meningitis is poorly tolerated and fraught with difficulties related to maintaining cerebrospinal fluid access. Thus, intrathecal therapy with amphotericin B is being increasingly supplanted by other therapies but remains an option in cases of fungal central nervous system infections that have not responded to other agents.

Local administration of amphotericin B has been used with success. Mycotic corneal ulcers and keratitis can be cured with topical drops as well as by direct subconjunctival injection. Fungal arthritis has been treated with adjunctive local injection directly into the joint. Candiduria responds to bladder irrigation with amphotericin B, and this route has been shown to produce no significant systemic toxicity.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

The toxicity of amphotericin B can be divided into two broad categories: immediate reactions, related to the infusion of the drug, and those occurring more slowly.

\section*{I NFUSION-RELATED TOXI CITY}

These infusion-related reactions are nearly universal and consist of fever, chills, muscle spasms, vomiting, headache, and hypotension. They can be ameliorated by slowing the infusion rate or decreasing the daily dose. Premedication with antipyretics, antihistamines, meperidine, or corticosteroids can be helpful. When starting therapy, many clinicians administer a test dose of 1 mg intravenously to gauge the severity of the reaction. This can serve as a guide to an initial dosing regimen and premedication strategy.

\section*{CUMULATI VE TOXI CITY}

Renal damage is the most significant toxic reaction. Renal impairment occurs in nearly all patients treated with clinically significant doses of amphotericin. The degree of azotemia is variable and often stabilizes during therapy, but it can be serious enough to necessitate dialysis. A reversible component is associated with decreased renal perfusion and represents a form of prerenal renal failure. An irreversible component results from renal tubular injury and subsequent dysfunction. The irreversible form of amphotericin nephrotoxicity usually occurs in the setting of prolonged administration ( $>4 \mathrm{~g}$ cumulative dose). Renal toxicity commonly manifests as renal tubular acidosis and severe potassium and magnesium wasting. There is some evidence that the prerenal component can be attenuated with sodium loading, and it is common practice to administer normal saline infusions with the daily doses of amphotericin B.

Abnormalities of liver function tests are occasionally seen, as is a varying degree of anemia due to reduced erythropoietin production by damaged renal tubular cells. After intrathecal therapy with amphotericin, seizures and a chemical arachnoiditis may develop, often with serious neurologic sequelae.

\section*{FLUCYTOSI NE}

Flucytosine (5-FC) was discovered in 1957 during a search for novel antineoplastic agents. Though devoid of anticancer properties, it became apparent that it was a potent antifungal agent. Flucytosine is a watersoluble pyrimidine analog related to the chemotherapeutic agent fluorouracil (5-FU). Its spectrum of action is much narrower than that of amphotericin B.

Flucytosine

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Flucytosine is currently available in North America only in an oral formulation. The dosage is 100-150 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in patients with normal renal function. It is well absorbed (> 90\%), with serum concentrations peaking 1-2 hours after an oral dose. It is poorly protein-bound and penetrates well into all body fluid compartments, including the cerebrospinal fluid. It is eliminated by glomerular filtration with a half-life of

3-4 hours and is removed by hemodialysis. Levels rise rapidly with renal impairment and can lead to toxicity. Toxicity is more likely to occur in AIDS patients and those with renal insufficiency. Peak serum concentrations should be measured periodically in patients with renal insufficiency and maintained between 50 and $100 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Flucytosine is taken up by fungal cells via the enzyme cytosine permease. It is converted intracellularly first to 5-FU and then to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP), which inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis, respectively. Human cells are unable to convert the parent drug to its active metabolites.

Synergy with amphotericin B has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. It may be related to enhanced penetration of the flucytosine through amphotericin-damaged fungal cell membranes. In vitro synergy with azole drugs has also been seen, although the mechanism is unclear.

Resistance is thought to be mediated through altered metabolism of flucytosine, and, though uncommon in primary isolates, it develops rapidly in the course of flucytosine monotherapy.

\section*{Clinical Use}

The spectrum of activity of flucytosine is restricted to Cryptococcus neoformans, some candida species, and the dematiaceous molds that cause chromoblastomycosis. Flucytosine is not used as a single agent because of its demonstrated synergy with other agents and to avoid the development of secondary resistance. Clinical use at present is confined to combination therapy, either with amphotericin B for cryptococcal meningitis or with itraconazole for chromoblastomycosis.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

The adverse effects of flucytosine result from metabolism (possibly by intestinal flora) to the toxic antineoplastic compound fluorouracil. Bone marrow toxicity with anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are the most common adverse effects, with derangement of liver enzymes occurring less frequently. A form of toxic enterocolitis can occur. There seems to be a narrow therapeutic window, with an increased risk of toxicity at higher drug levels and resistance developing rapidly at subtherapeutic concentrations. The use of drug concentration measurements may be helpful in reducing the incidence of toxic reactions, especially when flucytosine is combined with nephrotoxic agents such as amphotericin B.

\section*{AZOLES}

Azoles are synthetic compounds that can be classified as either imidazoles or triazoles according to the number of nitrogen atoms in the five-membered azole ring as indicated below. The imidazoles consist of ketoconazole, miconazole, and clotrimazole (Figure 48-1). The latter two drugs are now used only in topical therapy. The triazoles include itraconazole, fluconazole, and voriconazole.
