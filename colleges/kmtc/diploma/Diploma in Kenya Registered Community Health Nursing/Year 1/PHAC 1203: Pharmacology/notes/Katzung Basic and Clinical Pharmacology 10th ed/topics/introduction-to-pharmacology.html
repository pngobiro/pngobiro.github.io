                    <p>Pharmacology can be defined as the study of substances that interact with living systems through chemical processes, especially by binding to regulatory molecules and activating or inhibiting normal body processes. These substances may be chemicals administered to achieve a beneficial therapeutic effect on some process within the patient or for their toxic effects on regulatory processes in parasites infecting the patient. Such deliberate therapeutic applications may be considered the proper role of medical pharmacology, which is often defined as the science of substances used to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease. Toxicology is that branch of pharmacology which deals with the undesirable effects of chemicals on living systems, from individual cells to complex ecosystems.</p>

                        </h2>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Prehistoric people undoubtedly recognized the beneficial or toxic effects of many plant and animal materials. Early written records from China and from Egypt list remedies of many types, including a few still recognized as useful drugs today. Most, however, were worthless or actually harmful. In the 1500 years or so preceding the present, there were sporadic attempts to introduce rational methods into medicine, but none was successful owing to the dominance of systems of thought that purported to explain all of biology and disease without the need for experimentation and observation. These schools promulgated bizarre notions such as the idea that disease was caused by excesses of bile or blood in the body, that wounds could be healed by applying a salve to the weapon that caused the wound, and so on.</p>
                            <p>Around the end of the 17th century, reliance on observation and experimentation began to replace theorizing in medicine, following the example of the physical sciences. As the value of these methods in the study of disease became clear, physicians in Great Britain and on the Continent began to apply them to the effects of traditional drugs used in their own practices. Thus, materia medica‚Äîthe science of drug preparation and the medical use of drugs‚Äîbegan to develop as the precursor to pharmacology. However, any real understanding of the mechanisms of action of drugs was prevented by the absence of methods for purifying active agents from the crude materials that were available and‚Äîeven more‚Äîby the lack of methods for testing hypotheses about the nature of drug actions.</p>
                            <p>In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Fran√ßois Magendie, and later his student Claude Bernard, began to develop the methods of experimental animal physiology and pharmacology. Advances in chemistry and the further development of physiology in the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries laid the foundation needed for understanding how drugs work at the organ and tissue levels. Paradoxically, real advances in basic pharmacology during this time were accompanied by an outburst of unscientific promotion by manufacturers and marketers of worthless "patent medicines." Not until the concepts of rational therapeutics, especially that of the controlled clinical trial, were reintroduced into medicine‚Äîonly about 50 years ago‚Äîdid it become possible to accurately evaluate therapeutic claims.</p>
                            <p>Around the same time, a major expansion of research efforts in all areas of biology began. As new concepts and new techniques were introduced, information accumulated about drug action and the biologic substrate of that action, the drug receptor. During the last half-century, many fundamentally new drug groups and new members of old groups were introduced. The last three decades have seen an
                                even more rapid growth of information and understanding of the molecular basis for drug action. The molecular mechanisms of action of many drugs have now been identified, and numerous receptors have been isolated, structurally characterized, and cloned. In fact, the use of receptor identification methods (described in Chapter 2) has led to the discovery of many orphan receptors‚Äîreceptors for which no ligand has been discovered and whose function can only be surmised. Studies of the local molecular environment of receptors have shown that receptors and effectors do not function in isolation; they are strongly influenced by companion regulatory proteins. Decoding of the genomes of many species‚Äîfrom bacteria to humans‚Äîhas led to the recognition of unsuspected relationships between receptor families and the ways that receptor proteins have evolved. Pharmacogenomics‚Äîthe relation of the individual's genetic makeup to his or her response to specific drugs‚Äîis close to becoming a practical area of therapy (see Pharmacology & Genetics). Much of that progress is summarized in this book.</p>
                            <p>The extension of scientific principles into everyday therapeutics is still going on, although the medication-consuming public unfortunately is still exposed to vast amounts of inaccurate, incomplete, or unscientific information regarding the pharmacologic effects of chemicals. This has resulted in the faddish use of innumerable expensive, ineffective, and sometimes harmful remedies and the growth of a huge "alternative health care" industry. Conversely, lack of understanding of basic scientific principles in biology and statistics and the absence of critical thinking about public health issues has led to rejection of medical science by a segment of the public and to a common tendency to assume that all adverse drug effects are the result of malpractice.</p>
                            <p>Two general principles that the student should always remember are, first, that all substances can under certain circumstances be toxic; and second, that all dietary supplements and all therapies promoted as health-enhancing should meet the same standards of efficacy and safety, ie, there should be no artificial separation between scientific medicine and "alternative" or "complementary" medicine.</p>

                            <p>It has been known for centuries that certain diseases are inherited, and we now understand that individuals with such diseases have a heritable abnormality in their DNA. During the last 10 years, the genomes of humans, mice, and many other organisms have been decoded in considerable detail. This has opened the door to a remarkable range of new approaches to research and treatment. It is now possible in the case of some inherited diseases to define exactly which DNA base pairs are anomalous and in which chromosome they appear. In a small number of animal models of such diseases, it has been possible to correct the abnormality by gene therapy, ie, insertion of an appropriate "healthy" gene into somatic cells. Human somatic cell gene therapy has been attempted, but the technical difficulties are great.</p>
                            <p>Studies of a newly discovered receptor or endogenous ligand are often confounded by incomplete knowledge of the exact role of that receptor or ligand. One of the most powerful of the new genetic techniques is the ability to breed animals (usually mice) in which the gene for the receptor or its endogenous ligand has been "knocked out," ie, mutated so that the gene product is absent or nonfunctional. Homozygous knockout mice usually have complete suppression of that function, whereas heterozygous animals usually have partial suppression. Observation of the behavior, biochemistry, and physiology of the knockout mice often defines the role of the missing gene product very clearly. When the products of a particular gene are so essential that even heterozygotes do not survive to birth, it is sometimes possible to breed "knockdown" versions with only limited suppression of
                                function. Conversely, "knockin" mice have been bred, which overexpress certain proteins of interest.</p>
                            <p>Some patients respond to certain drugs with greater than usual sensitivity to standard doses. It is now clear that such increased sensitivity is often due to a very small genetic modification that results in decreased activity of a particular enzyme responsible for eliminating that drug. (Such variations are discussed in Chapter 4.) Pharmacogenomics (or pharmacogenetics) is the study of the genetic variations that cause differences in drug response among individuals or populations. Future clinicians may screen every patient for a variety of such differences before prescribing a drug.</p>

                             <p>Much of the recent progress in the application of drugs to disease problems can be ascribed to the pharmaceutical industry and specifically to "big pharma," the multibillion-dollar corporations that specialize in drug discovery and development. These entities deserve great credit for making possible many of the therapeutic advances that we enjoy today. As described in Chapter 5, these companies are uniquely skilled in exploiting discoveries from academic and governmental laboratories and translating these basic findings into commercially successful therapeutic breakthroughs.</p>
                            <p>Such breakthroughs come at a price, however, and the escalating cost of drugs has become a significant contributor to the inflationary increase in the cost of health care. Development of new drugs is enormously expensive and to survive and prosper, big pharma must pay the costs of drug development and marketing and return a profit to its shareholders. At present, considerable controversy surrounds drug pricing. Critics claim that the costs of development and marketing are grossly inflated by marketing procedures, which may consume as much as 25% or more of a company's budget in advertising and other promotional efforts. Furthermore, profit margins for big pharma have historically exceeded all other industries by a significant factor. Finally, pricing schedules for many drugs vary dramatically from country to country and even within countries, where large organizations can negotiate favorable prices and small ones cannot. Some countries have already addressed these problems, and it seems likely that all countries will have to do so during the next few decades.</p>

                            <p>In the most general sense, a drug may be defined as any substance that brings about a change in biologic function through its chemical actions. In the great majority of cases, the drug molecule interacts with a specific molecule in the biologic system that plays a regulatory role. This molecule is called a receptor. The nature of receptors is discussed more fully in Chapter 2. In a very small number of cases, drugs known as chemical antagonists may interact directly with other drugs, whereas a few drugs (osmotic agents) interact almost exclusively with water molecules. Drugs may be synthesized within the body (eg, hormones) or may be chemicals not synthesized in the body, ie, xenobiotics (from the Greek xenos, meaning "stranger"). Poisons are drugs that have almost exclusively harmful effects. However, Paracelsus (1493-1541) famously stated that "the dose makes the poison," meaning that almost all substances can be harmful if taken in the wrong dosage. Toxins are usually defined as poisons of biologic origin, ie, synthesized by plants or animals, in contrast to inorganic poisons such as lead and arsenic.</p>
                            <p>To interact chemically with its receptor, a drug molecule must have the appropriate size, electrical charge, shape, and atomic composition. Furthermore, a drug is often administered at a location distant from its intended site of action, eg, a pill given orally to relieve a headache. Therefore, a useful drug must have the necessary properties to be transported from its site of administration to its site of action. Finally, a practical drug should be inactivated or excreted from the body at a reasonable rate so that its actions will be of appropriate duration.</p>

                            <p>The molecular size of drugs varies from very small (lithium ion, MW 7) to very large (eg, alteplase [tPA], a protein of MW 59,050). However, most drugs have molecular weights between 100 and 1000. The lower limit of this narrow range is probably set by the requirements for specificity of action. To have a good "fit" to only one type of receptor, a drug molecule must be sufficiently unique in shape, charge, and other properties, to prevent its binding to other receptors. To achieve such selective binding, it appears that a molecule should in most cases be at least 100 MW units in size. The upper limit in molecular weight is determined primarily by the requirement that drugs be able to move within the body (eg, from site of administration to site of action). Drugs much larger than MW 1000 do not diffuse readily between compartments of the body (see Permeation, below). Therefore, very large drugs (usually proteins) must often be administered directly into the compartment where they have their effect. In the case of alteplase, a clot-dissolving enzyme, the drug is administered directly into the vascular compartment by intravenous or intra-arterial infusion.</p>

                            <p>Drugs interact with receptors by means of chemical forces or bonds. These are of three major types: covalent, electrostatic, and hydrophobic. Covalent bonds are very strong and in many cases not reversible under biologic conditions. Thus, the covalent bond formed between the acetyl group of aspirin and its enzyme target in platelets, cyclooxygenase, is not readily broken. The platelet aggregation-blocking effect of aspirin lasts long after free acetylsalicylic acid has disappeared from the bloodstream (about 15 minutes) and is reversed only by the synthesis of new enzyme in new platelets, a process that takes about 7 days. Other examples of highly reactive, covalent bond-forming drugs are the DNA-alkylating agents used in cancer chemotherapy to disrupt cell division in the tumor.</p>
                            <p>Electrostatic bonding is much more common than covalent bonding in drug-receptor interactions. Electrostatic bonds vary from relatively strong linkages between permanently charged ionic molecules to weaker hydrogen bonds and very weak induced dipole interactions such as van der Waals forces and similar phenomena. Electrostatic bonds are weaker than covalent bonds.</p>
                            <p>Hydrophobic bonds are usually quite weak and are probably important in the interactions of highly lipidsoluble drugs with the lipids of cell membranes and perhaps in the interaction of drugs with the internal walls of receptor "pockets."</p>
                            <p>The specific nature of a particular drug-receptor bond is of less practical importance than the fact that drugs that bind through weak bonds to their receptors are generally more selective than drugs that bind by means of very strong bonds. This is because weak bonds require a very precise fit of the drug to its receptor if an interaction is to occur. Only a few receptor types are likely to provide such a precise fit for a particular drug structure. Thus, if we wished to design a highly selective short-acting drug for a particular receptor, we would avoid highly reactive molecules that form covalent bonds and instead choose molecules that form weaker bonds.</p>
                            <p>A few substances that are almost completely inert in the chemical sense nevertheless have significant pharmacologic effects. For example, xenon, an "inert" gas, has anesthetic effects at elevated pressures.</p>

                             <p>The shape of a drug molecule must be such as to permit binding to its receptor site via the bonds just described. Optimally, the drug's shape is complementary to that of the receptor site in the same way that a key is complementary to a lock. Furthermore, the phenomenon of chirality (stereoisomerism) is so common in biology that more than half of all useful drugs are chiral molecules; that is, they exist as enantiomeric pairs. Drugs with two asymmetric centers have four diastereomers, eg, ephedrine, a sympathomimetic drug. In most cases, one of these enantiomers is much more potent than its mirror image enantiomer, reflecting a better fit to the receptor molecule. For example, the ( S ) ( + ) enantiomer of methacholine, a parasympathomimetic drug, is over 250 times more potent than the (R)(-) enantiomer. If one imagines the receptor site to be like a glove into which the drug molecule must fit to bring about its effect, it is clear why a "left-oriented" drug is more effective in binding to a left-hand receptor than its "right-oriented" enantiomer.</p>
                            <p>The more active enantiomer at one type of receptor site may not be more active at another type, eg, a receptor type that may be responsible for some other effect. For example, carvedilol, a drug that interacts with adrenoceptors, has a single chiral center and thus two enantiomers (Table 1-1). One of these enantiomers, the (S)(- ) isomer, is a potent B-receptor blocker. The (R)(+) isomer is 100 -fold weaker at the Breceptor. However, the isomers are approximately equipotent as a-receptor blockers. Ketamine is an intravenous anesthetic. The (+) enantiomer is a more potent anesthetic and is less toxic than the (-) enantiomer. Unfortunately, the drug is still used as the racemic mixture.</p>

                             <p>Rational design of drugs implies the ability to predict the appropriate molecular structure of a drug on the basis of information about its biologic receptor. Until recently, no receptor was known in sufficient detail to permit such drug design. Instead, drugs were developed through random testing of chemicals or modification of drugs already known to have some effect (see Chapter 5). However, during the past three decades, many receptors have been isolated and characterized. A few drugs now in use were developed through molecular design based on a knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the receptor site. Computer programs are now available that can iteratively optimize drug structures to fit known receptors. As more becomes known about receptor structure, rational drug design will become more common.</p>

The actions of the drug on the body are termed pharmacodynamic processes; the principles of pharmacodynamics are presented in greater detail in Chapter 2. These properties determine the group in which the drug is classified and play the major role in deciding whether that group is appropriate therapy for a particular symptom or disease. The actions of the body on the drug are called pharmacokinetic processes and are described in Chapters 3 and 4. Pharmacokinetic processes govern the absorption, distribution, and elimination of drugs and are of great practical importance in the choice and administration of a particular drug for a particular patient, eg, a patient with impaired renal function.

                            <p>Agonist drugs bind to and activate the receptor in some fashion, which directly or indirectly brings about the effect. Some receptors incorporate effector machinery in the same molecule, so that drug binding brings about the effect directly, eg, opening of an ion channel or activation of enzyme activity. Other receptors are linked through one or more intervening coupling molecules to a separate effector molecule. The five major types of drug-receptor-effector coupling systems are discussed in Chapter 2. Pharmacologic antagonist drugs, by binding to a receptor, prevent binding by other molecules. For example, acetylcholine receptor blockers such as atropine are antagonists because they prevent access of acetylcholine and similar agonist drugs to the acetylcholine receptor and they stabilize the receptor in its inactive state. These agents reduce the effects of acetylcholine and similar molecules in the body.</p>

For example, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, by slowing the destruction of endogenous acetylcholine, cause cholinomimetic effects that closely resemble the actions of cholinoceptor agonist molecules even though cholinesterase inhibitors do not bind or only incidentally bind to cholinoceptors (see Chapter 7, Cholinoceptor-Activating & Cholinesterase-Inhibiting Drugs). Other drugs bind to receptors and activate them but do not evoke as great a response as so-called full agonists. Thus, pindolol, a Badrenoceptor "partial agonist," may act as either an agonist (if no full agonist is present) or as an antagonist (if a full agonist such as epinephrine is present).

In many cases, however, the action may persist after the drug has dissociated, because, for example, some coupling molecule is still present in activated form. In
                                the case of drugs that bind covalently to the receptor site, the effect may persist until the drug-receptor complex is destroyed and new receptors or enzymes are synthesized, as described previously for aspirin.

                            <p>To function as a receptor, an endogenous molecule must first be selective in choosing ligands (drug molecules) to bind; and second, it must change its function upon binding in such a way that the function of the biologic system (cell, tissue, etc) is altered. The first characteristic is required to avoid constant activation of the receptor by promiscuous binding of many different ligands. The second characteristic is clearly necessary if the ligand is to cause a pharmacologic effect. The body contains many molecules that are capable of binding drugs, however, and not all of these endogenous molecules are regulatory molecules. Binding of a drug to a nonregulatory molecule such as plasma albumin will result in no detectable change in the function of the biologic system, so this endogenous molecule can be called an inert binding site. Such binding is not completely without significance, however, because it affects the distribution of drug within the body and determines the amount of free drug in the circulation. Both of these factors are of pharmacokinetic importance (see below and Chapter 3).</p>

Most often, a drug is administered into one body compartment, eg, the gut, and must move to its site of action in another compartment, eg, the brain. This requires that the drug be absorbed into the blood from its site of administration and distributed to its site of action, permeating through the various barriers that separate these compartments. For a drug given orally to produce an effect in the central nervous system, these barriers include the tissues that make up the wall of the intestine, the walls of the capillaries that perfuse the gut, and the "blood-brain barrier," the walls of the capillaries that perfuse the brain. Finally, after bringing about its effect, a drug should be eliminated at a reasonable rate by metabolic inactivation, by excretion from the body, or by a combination of these processes.</p>

                             <p>Aqueous diffusion occurs within the larger aqueous compartments of the body (interstitial space, cytosol, etc) and across epithelial membrane tight junctions and the endothelial lining of blood vessels through aqueous pores that‚Äîin some tissues‚Äîpermit the passage of molecules as large as MW 20,000-30,000.*</p>
                            <p>Aqueous diffusion of drug molecules is usually driven by the concentration gradient of the permeating drug, a downhill movement described by Fick's law (see below). Drug molecules that are bound to large plasma proteins (eg, albumin) do not permeate most vascular aqueous pores. If the drug is charged, its flux is also influenced by electrical fields (eg, the membrane potential and‚Äîin parts of the nephron‚Äîthe transtubular potential).</p>
                            <p>*The capillaries of the brain, the testes, and some other tissues are characterized by the absence of pores that permit aqueous diffusion. They may also contain high concentrations of drug export pumps (MDR pumps; see text). These tissues are therefore protected or "sanctuary" sites from many circulating drugs.</p>

                             <p>Lipid diffusion is the most important limiting factor for drug permeation because of the large number of lipid barriers that separate the compartments of the body. Because these lipid barriers separate aqueous compartments, the lipid:aqueous partition coefficient of a drug determines how readily the molecule moves between aqueous and lipid media. In the case of weak acids and weak bases (which gain or lose electrical charge-bearing protons, depending on the pH ), the ability to move from aqueous to lipid or vice versa varies with the pH of the medium, because charged molecules attract water molecules. The ratio of lipid-soluble form to water-soluble form for a weak acid or weak base is expressed by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (see below).</p>

                             <p>Special carrier molecules exist for certain substances that are important for cell function and too large or too insoluble in lipid to diffuse passively through membranes, eg, peptides, amino acids, glucose. These carriers bring about movement by active transport or facilitated diffusion and, unlike passive diffusion, are saturable and inhibitable. Because many drugs are or resemble such naturally occurring peptides, amino acids, or sugars, they can use these carriers to cross membranes.</p>
                            <p>Many cells also contain less selective membrane carriers that are specialized for expelling foreign molecules. One large family of such transporters bind adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and is called the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) family. This family includes the P-glycoprotein or multidrug-resistance type 1 (MDR1) transporter found in the brain, testes, and other tissues, and in some drug-resistant neoplastic cells. Similar transport molecules from the ABC family, the multidrug resistanceassociated protein (MRP1 through MRP5) transporters, play important roles in excretion of some drugs or their metabolites into urine and bile and in resistance of some tumors to chemotherapeutic drugs. Several other transporter families have been identified that do not bind ATP but use ion gradients for transport energy. Some of these are particularly important in the uptake of neurotransmitters across nerve ending membranes.</p>

                             <p>A few substances are so large or impermeant that they can enter cells only by endocytosis, the process by which the substance is engulfed by the cell membrane and carried into the cell by pinching off of the newly formed vesicle inside the membrane. The substance can then be released inside the cytosol by breakdown of the vesicle membrane. This process is responsible for the transport of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, complexed with a binding protein (intrinsic factor) across the wall of the gut into the blood. Similarly, iron is transported into hemoglobin-synthesizing red blood cell precursors in association with the protein transferrin. Specific receptors for the transport proteins must be present for this process to work.</p>
                            <p>The reverse process (exocytosis) is responsible for the secretion of many substances from cells. For example, many neurotransmitter substances are stored in membrane-bound vesicles in nerve endings to protect them from metabolic destruction in the cytoplasm. Appropriate activation of the nerve ending causes fusion of the storage vesicle with the cell membrane and expulsion of its contents into the extracellular space (see Chapter 6).</p>

                            <p>Note that the protonated form of a weak acid is the neutral, more lipid-soluble form, whereas the unprotonated form of a weak base is the neutral form. The law of mass action requires that these reactions move to the left in an acid environment (low pH, excess protons available) and to the right in an alkaline environment. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates the ratio of protonated to unprotonated weak acid or weak base to the molecule's $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}$ and the pH of the medium as follows:</p>
                             <div class="equation">
                                 $$
                                 \log \frac{\text { (Protonated) }}{\text { (Unprotonated) }}=\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}-\mathrm{pH}
                                 $$
                             </div>
                            <p>This equation applies to both acidic and basic drugs. Inspection confirms that the lower the pH relative to the $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}$, the greater will be the fraction of drug in the protonated form. Because the uncharged form is the more lipid-soluble, more of a weak acid will be in the lipid-soluble form at acid pH , whereas more of a basic drug will be in the lipid-soluble form at alkaline pH .</p>
                            <p>Application of this principle is made in the manipulation of drug excretion by the kidney. Almost all drugs are filtered at the glomerulus. If a drug is in a lipid-soluble form during its passage down the renal tubule, a significant fraction will be reabsorbed by simple passive diffusion. If the goal is to accelerate excretion of the drug (eg, in a case of drug overdose), it is important to prevent its reabsorption from the tubule. This can often be accomplished by adjusting urine pH to make certain that most of the drug is in the ionized state, as shown in Figure 1-1. As a result of this partitioning effect, the drug will be "trapped" in the urine. Thus, weak acids are usually excreted faster in alkaline urine; weak bases are usually excreted faster in acidic urine. Other body fluids in which pH differences from blood pH may cause trapping or reabsorption are the contents of the stomach and small intestine; breast milk; aqueous humor; and vaginal and prostatic secretions (Table 1-3).</p>

                            <p>${}^{1}$ Body fluid protonated-to-unprotonated drug ratios were calculated using each of the pH extremes cited; a blood pH of 7.4 was used for blood: drug ratio. For example, the steady-state urine: blood ratio for sulfadiazine is 0.12 at a urine pH of 5.0 ; this ratio is 4.65 at a urine pH of 8.0 . Thus, sulfadiazine is much more effectively trapped and excreted in alkaline urine.</p>

                            <p>As suggested by Table 1-2, a large number of drugs are weak bases. Most of these bases are aminecontaining molecules. The nitrogen of a neutral amine has three atoms associated with it plus a pair of unshared electrons (see the display that follows). The three atoms may consist of one carbon (designated "R") and two hydrogens (a primary amine), two carbons and one hydrogen (a secondary amine), or three carbon atoms (a tertiary amine). Each of these three forms may reversibly bind a proton with the unshared electrons. Some drugs have a fourth carbon-nitrogen bond; these are quaternary amines. However, the quaternary amine is permanently charged and has no unshared electrons with which to reversibly bind a proton. Therefore, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines may undergo reversible protonation and vary their lipid solubility with pH , but quaternary amines are always in the poorly lipid-soluble charged form.</p>

                                an impractical goal and, fortunately, is unnecessary. Almost all of the several thousand drugs currently available can be arranged in about 70 groups. Many of the drugs within each group are very similar in pharmacodynamic actions and often in their pharmacokinetic properties as well. For most groups, one or more prototype drugs can be identified that typify the most important characteristics of the group. This permits classification of other important drugs in the group as variants of the prototype, so that only the prototype must be learned in detail and, for the remaining drugs, only the differences from the prototype.</p>

                            <p>The references at the end of each chapter in this book were selected to provide reviews, or classic publications, of information specific to those chapters. Specific questions relating to basic or clinical research are best answered by referring to the journals covering general pharmacology and clinical specialties. For the student and the physician, three periodicals can be recommended as especially useful sources of current information about drugs: The New England Journal of Medicine, which publishes much original drug-related clinical research as well as frequent reviews of topics in pharmacology; The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics, which publishes brief critical reviews of new and old therapies, mostly pharmacologic; and Drugs, which publishes extensive reviews of drugs and drug groups.</p>
                            <p>Other sources of information pertinent to the USA should be mentioned as well. The "package insert" is a summary of information that the manufacturer is required to place in the prescription sales package; Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR) is a compendium of package inserts published annually with supplements twice a year. The USP DI (vol 1, Drug Information for the Health Care Professional) is a large annual drug compendium with monthly Internet updates published by the Micromedex Corporation. The package insert consists of a brief description of the pharmacology of the product. While this brochure contains much practical information, it is also used as a means of shifting liability for untoward drug reactions from the manufacturer onto the practitioner. Therefore, the manufacturer typically lists every toxic effect ever reported, no matter how rare. A useful and objective quarterly handbook that presents information on drug toxicity and interactions is Drug Interactions: Analysis and Management. Finally, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has an Internet website that carries news regarding recent drug approvals, withdrawals, warnings, etc. It can be reached using a personal computer equipped with Internet browser software at http://www.fda.gov.</p>
