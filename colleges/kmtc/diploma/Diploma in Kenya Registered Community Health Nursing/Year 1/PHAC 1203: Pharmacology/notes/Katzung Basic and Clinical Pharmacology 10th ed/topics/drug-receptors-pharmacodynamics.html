                     <p>Therapeutic and toxic effects of drugs result from their interactions with molecules in the patient. Most drugs ac by associating with specific macromolecules in ways that alter the macromolecules' biochemical or biophysical activities. This idea, more than a century old, is embodied in the term receptor: the component of a cell or organism that interacts with a drug and initiates the chain of events leading to the drug's observed effects.</p>
                    <p>Receptors have become the central focus of investigation of drug effects and their mechanisms of action (pharmacodynamics). The receptor concept, extended to endocrinology, immunology, and molecular biology, h. proved essential for explaining many aspects of biologic regulation. Many drug receptors have been isolated an characterized in detail, thus opening the way to precise understanding of the molecular basis of drug action.</p>
                    <p>The receptor concept has important practical consequences for the development of drugs and for arriving at therapeutic decisions in clinical practice. These consequences form the basis for understanding the actions and clinical uses of drugs described in almost every chapter of this book. They may be briefly summarized as follow:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li class="list-item">

                            <span class="item-text">(1) Receptors largely determine the quantitative relations between dose or concentration of drug a pharmacologic effects. The receptor's affinity for binding a drug determines the concentration of drug require to form a significant number of drug-receptor complexes, and the total number of receptors may limit the maximal effect a drug may produce.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-item">

                            <span class="item-text">(2) Receptors are responsible for selectivity of drug action. The molecular size, shape, and electrical charge of a drug determine whether‚Äîand with what affinity‚Äîit will bind to a particular receptor among the vasi array of chemically different binding sites available in a cell, tissue, or patient. Accordingly, changes in the chemical structure of a drug can dramatically increase or decrease a new drug's affinities for different classes o receptors, with resulting alterations in therapeutic and toxic effects.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-item">
                            <span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span>
                            <span class="item-text">(3) Receptors mediate the actions of both pharmacologic agonists and antagonists. Some drugs and many natural ligands, such as hormones and neurotransmitters, regulate the function of receptor macromolecu as agonists; ie, they activate the receptor to signal as a direct result of binding to it. Some agonists activate a single kind of receptor to produce all of their biologic functions, whereas others selectively promote one receptc function more than another.</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Other drugs act as pharmacologic antagonists; ie, they bind to receptors but do not activate generation of a signal; consequently, they interfere with the ability of an agonist to activate the receptor. The effect of a so-call "pure" antagonist on a cell or in a patient depends entirely on its preventing the binding of agonist molecules ar blocking their biologic actions. Other antagonists, in addition to preventing agonist binding, suppress the basal signaling ("constitutive") activity of receptors. Some of the most useful drugs in clinical medicine are pharmacologic antagonists.</p>

                            <p>Most receptors are proteins, presumably because the structures of polypeptides provide both the necessary diversity and the necessary specificity of shape and electrical charge. Receptors vary greatly in structure and ce
                                be identified in many ways. Traditionally, drug binding was used to identify or purify receptors from tissue extracts; consequently, receptors were discovered more recently than the drugs that bind to them. However, advances in molecular biology and genome sequencing have begun to reverse this order. Now receptors are be discovered by predicted structure or sequence homology to other (known) receptors, and drugs that bind to the are developed later using chemical screening methods. This effort has revealed, for many known drugs, a large diversity of receptors than previously anticipated. It has also identified a number of "orphan" receptors, so-call because their ligands are presently unknown, which may prove to be useful targets for the development of new drugs.</p>
                            <p>The best-characterized drug receptors are regulatory proteins, which mediate the actions of endogenous chemical signals such as neurotransmitters, autacoids, and hormones. This class of receptors mediates the effe of many of the most useful therapeutic agents. The molecular structures and biochemical mechanisms of these regulatory receptors are described in a later section entitled Signaling Mechanisms & Drug Action.</p>
                            <p>Other classes of proteins that have been clearly identified as drug receptors include enzymes, which may be inhibited (or, less commonly, activated) by binding a drug (eg, dihydrofolate reductase, the receptor for the antineoplastic drug methotrexate); transport proteins (eg, $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase, the membrane receptor for cardioactive digitalis glycosides); and structural proteins (eg, tubulin, the receptor for colchicine, an antiinflammatory agent).</p>
                            <p>This chapter deals with three aspects of drug receptor function, presented in increasing order of complexity: (1 Receptors as determinants of the quantitative relation between the concentration of a drug and the pharmacolc response. (2) Receptors as regulatory proteins and components of chemical signaling mechanisms that provide targets for important drugs. (3) Receptors as key determinants of the therapeutic and toxic effects of drugs in patients.</p>

                            <p>This hyperbolic relation resembles the mass action law, which describes association between two molecules of a given affinity. This resemblance suggests that drug agonists act by binding to ("occupying") a distinct class of biologic molecules with a characteristic affinity for the drug receptor. Radioactive receptor ligands have been us to confirm this occupancy assumption in many drug-receptor systems. In these systems, drug bound to receptc (B) relates to the concentration of free (unbound) drug (C) as depicted in Figure 2-1B and as described by an analogous equation:</p>

                            <p>in which $\mathrm{B}_{\text {max }}$ indicates the total concentration of receptor sites (ie, sites bound to the drug at infinitely high concentrations of free drug). $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{d}}$ (the equilibrium dissociation constant) represents the concentration of free dru at which half-maximal binding is observed. This constant characterizes the receptor's affinity for binding the dri in a reciprocal fashion: If the $K_{d}$ is low, binding affinity is high, and vice versa. The $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ and $K_{d}$ may be identical
                                but need not be, as discussed below. Dose-response data are often presented as a plot of the drug effect (ordinate) against the logarithm of the dose or concentration (abscissa). This mathematical maneuver transforr the hyperbolic curve of Figure 2-1 into a sigmoid curve with a linear midportion (eg, Figure 2-2). This expands the scale of the concentration axis at low concentrations (where the effect is changing rapidly) and compresses at high concentrations (where the effect is changing slowly), but has no special biologic or pharmacologic significance.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                             <p>When a receptor is occupied by an agonist, the resulting conformational change is only the first of many steps usually required to produce a pharmacologic response. The transduction process that links drug occupancy of receptors and pharmacologic response is often termed coupling. The relative efficiency of occupancy-response coupling is partially determined by the initial conformational change in the receptor; thus, the effects of full agonists can be considered more efficiently coupled to receptor occupancy than can the effects of partial agonis as described below. Coupling efficiency is also determined by the biochemical events that transduce receptor
                                occupancy into cellular response. Sometimes the biologic effect of the drug is linearly related to the number of receptors bound. This is often true for drug-regulated ion channels, eg, where the ion current produced by the drug is directly proportional to the number of receptors (ion channels) bound. In other cases the biologic respor is a more complex function of drug binding to receptors. This is often true for receptors linked to enzymatic sigr transduction cascades, eg, where the biologic response often increases disproportionately to the number of receptors occupied by drug.</p>
                            <p>Many factors can contribute to nonlinear occupancy-response coupling, and often these factors are only partiall: understood. The concept of "spare" receptors, irrespective of the precise biochemical mechanism involved, can help us to think about these effects. Receptors are said to be "spare" for a given pharmacologic response if it is possible to elicit a maximal biologic response at a concentration of agonist that does not result in occupancy of full complement of available receptors. Experimentally, spare receptors may be demonstrated by using irreversible antagonists to prevent binding of agonist to a proportion of available receptors and showing that h·ªã concentrations of agonist can still produce an undiminished maximal response (Figure 2-2). Thus, the same maximal inotropic response of heart muscle to catecholamines can be elicited even under conditions where 90% of the B-adrenoceptors are occupied by a quasi-irreversible antagonist. Accordingly, myocardial cells are said tc contain a large proportion of spare B-adrenoceptors.</p>
                            <p>How can we account for the phenomenon of spare receptors? In the example of the B-adrenoceptor, receptor activation promotes binding of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to an intermediate signaling protein, and activatio of the signaling intermediate may greatly outlast the agonist-receptor interaction (see the following section on 1 Proteins & Second Messengers). In such a case, the "spareness" of receptors is temporal . Maximal response c√© be elicited by activation of relatively few receptors because the response initiated by an individual ligand-recept binding event persists longer than the binding event itself.</p>
                            <p>In other cases, where the biochemical mechanism is not understood, we imagine that the receptors might be spare in number. If the concentration or amount of cellular components other than the receptors limits the coupling of receptor occupancy to response, then a maximal response can occur without occupancy of all receptors. Thus, the sensitivity of a cell or tissue to a particular concentration of agonist depends not only on tr affinity of the receptor for binding the agonist (characterized by the $K_{d}$ ) but also on the degree of sparenesstotal number of receptors present compared with the number actually needed to elicit a maximal biologic response.</p>
                            <p>The concept of spare receptors is very useful clinically because it allows one to think precisely about the effects drug dosage, without needing to consider biochemical details of the signaling response. The $K_{d}$ of the agonistreceptor interaction determines what fraction ( $\mathrm{B}/ \mathrm{B}_{\max }$ ) of total receptors will be occupied at a given free concentration (C) of agonist regardless of the receptor concentration:</p>
                             <div class="equation">
                                 $$
                                 \frac{B}{B_{\max }}=\frac{C}{C+K_{d}}
                                 $$
                             </div>
                             <p>Imagine a responding cell with four receptors and four effectors. Here the number of effectors does not limit thr maximal response, and the receptors are not spare in number. Consequently, an agonist present at a concentration equal to the $K_{d}$ will occupy 50% of the receptors, and half of the effectors will be activated, producing a half-maximal response (ie, two receptors stimulate two effectors). Now imagine that the number of receptors increases 10-fold to 40 receptors but that the total number of effectors remains constant. Most of the receptors are now spare in number. As a result, a much lower concentration of agonist suffices to occupy two o

                             <p>Receptor antagonists bind to receptors but do not activate them. The primary action of antagonists is to preven agonists (other drugs or endogenous regulatory molecules) from activating receptors. Some antagonists (socalled "inverse agonists"), also reduce receptor activity below basal levels observed in the absence of bound ligand. Antagonists are divided into two classes depending on whether or not they reversibly compete with agonists for binding to receptors.</p>
                            <p>In the presence of a fixed concentration of agonist, increasing concentrations of a reversible competitive antagonist progressively inhibit the agonist response; high antagonist concentrations prevent response completely. Conversely, sufficiently high concentrations of agonist can completely surmount the effect of a give concentration of the antagonist; that is, the $\mathrm{E}_{\text {max }}$ for the agonist remains the same for any fixed concentration c antagonist (Figure 2-3A). Because the antagonism is competitive, the presence of antagonist increases the agonist concentration required for a given degree of response, and so the agonist concentration-effect curve is shifted to the right.</p>

                            <p>Changes in agonist concentration-effect curves produced by a competitive antagonist (Panel A ) or by an irreversible antago‡•§ (Panel B ). In the presence of a competitive antagonist, higher concentrations of agonist are required to produce a given eff thus the agonist concentration ( $\mathrm{C}^{\prime}$ ) required for a given effect in the presence of concentration [ 1 ] of an antagonist is shifted the right, as shown. High agonist concentrations can overcome inhibition by a competitive antagonist. This is not the case w an irreversible (or noncompetitive) antagonist, which reduces the maximal effect the agonist can achieve, although it may nc change its $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$.</p>

                            <p>The concentration ( $\mathrm{C}^{\prime}$ ) of an agonist required to produce a given effect in the presence of a fixed concentration ([I]) of competitive antagonist is greater than the agonist concentration (C) required to produce the same effec in the absence of the antagonist. The ratio of these two agonist concentrations (the "dose ratio") is related to tr dissociation constant ( $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{i}}$ ) of the antagonist by the Schild equation:</p>
                             <div class="equation">
                                 $$
                                 \frac{C^{\prime}}{C}=1+\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}
                                 $$
                             </div>
                            <p>Pharmacologists often use this relation to determine the $K_{i}$ of a competitive antagonist. Even without knowledg of the relationship between agonist occupancy of the receptor and response, the $K_{i}$ can be determined simply a accurately. As shown in Figure 2-3, concentration response curves are obtained in the presence and in the absence of a fixed concentration of competitive antagonist; comparison of the agonist concentrations required $t$ produce identical degrees of pharmacologic effect in the two situations reveals the antagonist's $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{i}}$. If $\mathrm{C}^{\prime}$ is twice C, for example, then [I] = $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{i}}$.</p>
                            <p>For the clinician, this mathematical relation has two important therapeutic implications:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                                    <span class="item-text">(1) The degree of inhibition produced by a competitive antagonist depends on the concentration of antagonist. Different patients receiving a fixed dose of propranolol, for example, exhibit a wide range of plasma concentrations, owing to differences in clearance of the drug. As a result, the effects of a fixed dose of this competitive antagonist of norepinephrine may vary widely in patients, and the dose must be adjusted accordin!.</span>
                                </li>

                                    <span class="item-text">(2) Clinical response to a competitive antagonist depends on the concentration of agonist that is competing for binding to receptors. Here also propranolol provides a useful example: When this competitive B-adrenoceptor antagonist is administered in doses sufficient to block the effect of basal levels of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, resting heart rate is decreased. However, the increase in release of norepinephrine and epinephrine that occurs with exercise, postural changes, or emotional stress may suffice to overcome competiti antagonism by propranolol and increase heart rate, and thereby can influence therapeutic response.</span>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Some receptor antagonists bind to the receptor in an irreversible or nearly irreversible fashion, either by form a covalent bond with the receptor or by binding so tightly that, for practical purposes, the receptor is unavailab for binding of agonist. After occupancy of some proportion of receptors by such an antagonist, the number of remaining unoccupied receptors may be too low for the agonist (even at high concentrations) to elicit a respons comparable to the previous maximal response (Figure 2-3B). If spare receptors are present, however, a lower dose of an irreversible antagonist may leave enough receptors unoccupied to allow achievement of maximum response to agonist, although a higher agonist concentration will be required (Figures 2-2B and C ; see Receptc Effector Coupling and Spare Receptors, above).</p>
                            <p>Therapeutically, irreversible antagonists present distinctive advantages and disadvantages. Once the irreversibl antagonist has occupied the receptor, it need not be present in unbound form to inhibit agonist responses. Consequently, the duration of action of such an irreversible antagonist is relatively independent of its own rate elimination and more dependent on the rate of turnover of receptor molecules.</p>
                            <p>Phenoxybenzamine, an irreversible a
                                catecholamines released from pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal medulla. If administration of phenoxybenzamine lowers blood pressure, blockade will be maintained even when the tumor episodically releas very large amounts of catecholamine. In this case, the ability to prevent responses to varying and high concentrations of agonist is a therapeutic advantage. If overdose occurs, however, a real problem may arise. If the adrenoceptor blockade cannot be overcome, excess effects of the drug must be antagonized "physiologically," ie, by using a pressor agent that does not act via areceptors.</p>
                            <p>Antagonists can function noncompetitively in a different way; that is, by binding to a site on the receptor protei separate from the agonist binding site and thereby preventing receptor activation without blocking agonist binding. Although these drugs act noncompetitively, their actions are reversible if they do not bind covalently. Some drugs, often called allosteric modulators, bind to a separate site on the receptor protein and alter recept function without inactivating the receptor. For example, benzodiazepines bind noncompetitively to ion channels activated by the neurotransmitter $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA), enhancing the net activating effect of GABA on channel conductance.</p>

                            <p>Based on the maximal pharmacologic response that occurs when all receptors are occupied, agonists can be divided into two classes: partial agonists produce a lower response, at full receptor occupancy, than do full agonists. Partial agonists produce concentration-effect curves that resemble those observed with full agonists the presence of an antagonist that irreversibly blocks some of the receptor sites (compare Figures 2-2 [curve [ and 2-4B). It is important to emphasize that the failure of partial agonists to produce a maximal response is nc due to decreased affinity for binding to receptors. Indeed, a partial agonist's inability to cause a maximal pharmacologic response, even when present at high concentrations that saturate binding to all receptors, is indicated by the fact that partial agonists competitively inhibit the responses produced by full agonists (Figure 2-4C). Many drugs used clinically as antagonists are in fact weak partial agonists.</p>

                            <p>Not all of the mechanisms of antagonism involve interactions of drugs or endogenous ligands at a single type of receptor, and some types of antagonism do not involve a receptor at all. For example, protamine, a protein tha positively charged at physiologic pH, can be used clinically to counteract the effects of heparin, an anticoagulan that is negatively charged; in this case, one drug acts as a chemical antagonist of the other simply by ionic binding that makes the other drug unavailable for interactions with proteins involved in blood clotting.</p>
                            <p>Another type of antagonism is physiologic antagonism between endogenous regulatory pathways mediated k different receptors. For example, several catabolic actions of the glucocorticoid hormones lead to increased bloc sugar, an effect that is physiologically opposed by insulin. Although glucocorticoids and insulin act on quite disti receptor-effector systems, the clinician must sometimes administer insulin to oppose the hyperglycemic effects a glucocorticoid hormone, whether the latter is elevated by endogenous synthesis (eg, a tumor of the adrenal cortex) or as a result of glucocorticoid therapy.</p>
                            <p>In general, use of a drug as a physiologic antagonist produces effects that are less specific and less easy to control than are the effects of a receptor-specific antagonist. Thus, for example, to treat bradycardia caused by increased release of acetylcholine from vagus nerve endings, the physician could use isoproterenol, a Badrenoceptor agonist that increases heart rate by mimicking sympathetic stimulation of the heart. However, us of this physiologic antagonist would be less rational‚Äîand potentially more dangerous‚Äîthan would use of a receptor-specific antagonist such as atropine (a competitive antagonist at the receptors at which acetylcholine slows heart rate).</p>

                            <p>Most transmembrane signaling is accomplished by a small number of different molecular mechanisms. Each typ of mechanism has been adapted, through the evolution of distinctive protein families, to transduce many differ signals. These protein families include receptors on the cell surface and within the cell, as well as enzymes and
                                other components that generate, amplify, coordinate, and terminate postreceptor signaling by chemical second messengers in the cytoplasm. This section first discusses the mechanisms for carrying chemical information across the plasma membrane and then outlines key features of cytoplasmic second messengers.</p>
                            <p>Five basic mechanisms of transmembrane signaling are well understood (Figure 2-5). Each uses a different strategy to circumvent the barrier posed by the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. These strategies use (1) lipid-soluble ligand that crosses the membrane and acts on an intracellular receptor; (2) a transmembrane receptor protein whose intracellular enzymatic activity is allosterically regulated by a ligand that binds to a site the protein's extracellular domain; (3) a transmembrane receptor that binds and stimulates a protein tyrosine kinase; (4) a ligand-gated transmembrane ion channel that can be induced to open or close by the binding of a ligand; or (5) a transmembrane receptor protein that stimulates a GTP-binding signal transducer protein (G protein), which in turn modulates production of an intracellular second messenger.</p>

For example, binding of glucocorticoid hormone to its normal receptor protein relieves an inhibitory constraint on the transcription-stimulating activity of the protein. Figure 2-6 schematically depicts the molecular mechanism of glucocorticoid action: In the absence of hormone, the receptor is bound to hsp90, a protein that appears to prevent normal folding of several structural domains of the receptor. Binding of hormone to the ligand-binding domain triggers release of hsp90. This allows the DNA-binding and transcription-activating domains of the receptor to fold into their functionally active conformations, so that the activated receptor can initiate transcript of target genes.</p>

                            <p>Mechanism of glucocorticoid action. The glucocorticoid receptor polypeptide is schematically depicted as a protein with three distinct domains. A heat-shock protein, hsp90, binds to the receptor in the absence of hormone and prevents folding into thr

                            <p>The mechanism used by hormones that act by regulating gene expression has two therapeutically important consequences:</p>

These receptors are polypeptides consisting of an extracellular hormone-binding domain and a cytoplasmic enzyme domain, which may be a protein tyrosine kinase, a serine kinase, or a guany cyclase (Figure 2-7).

                            <p>Mechanism of activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, a representative receptor tyrosine kinase. The recep polypeptide has extracellular and cytoplasmic domains, depicted above and below the plasma membrane. Upon binding of E( (circle), the receptor converts from its inactive monomeric state (left) to an active dimeric state (right), in which two receptc polypeptides bind noncovalently. The cytoplasmic domains become phosphorylated ( P ) on specific tyrosine residues ( Y ) and their enzymatic activities are activated, catalyzing phosphorylation of substrate proteins (S).</p>

                             <p>The receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway begins with binding of ligand, typically a polypeptide hormone o growth factor, to the receptor's extracellular domain. The resulting change in receptor conformation causes receptor molecules to bind to one another, which in turn brings together the tyrosine kinase domains, which become enzymatically active, and phosphorylate one another as well as additional downstream signaling protei‡•§ Activated receptors catalyze phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on different target signaling proteins, thereby allowing a single type of activated receptor to modulate a number of biochemical processes.</p>
                            <p>Insulin, for example, uses a single class of receptors to trigger increased uptake of glucose and amino acids, ar to regulate metabolism of glycogen and triglycerides in the cell. Similarly, each of the growth factors initiates in specific target cells a complex program of cellular events ranging from altered membrane transport of ions and metabolites to changes in the expression of many genes. Inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases are finding increased use in neoplastic disorders where excessive growth factor signaling is often involved. Some of these inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies (eg, trastuzumab, cetuximab), which bind to the extracellular domain of a particular receptor and interfere with binding of growth factor. Other inhibitors are membrane-permeant "small molecule" chemicals (eg, gefitinib, erlotinib), which inhibit the receptor's kinase activity in the cytoplasm.</p>
                            <p>The intensity and duration of action of EGF, PDGF, and other agents that act via receptor tyrosine kinases are limited by a process called receptor down-regulation. Ligand binding often induces accelerated endocytosis of receptors from the cell surface, followed by the degradation of those receptors (and their bound ligands). Wher this process occurs at a rate faster than de novo synthesis of receptors, the total number of cell-surface receptƒ± is reduced (down-regulated) and the cell's responsiveness to ligand is correspondingly diminished. A well-
                                understood example is the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase, which undergoes rapid endocytosis and is trafficked tc lysosomes after EGF binding; genetic mutations that interfere with this process cause excessive growth factor-induced cell proliferation and are associated with an increased susceptibility to certain types of cancer. Endocytosis of other receptor tyrosine kinases, most notably receptors for nerve growth factor, serves a very different function. Internalized nerve growth factor receptors are not rapidly degraded and are translocated in endocytic vesicles from the distal axon, where receptors are activated by nerve growth factor released from the innervated tissue, to the cell body. In the cell body the growth factor signal is transduced to transcription factor regulating the expression of genes controlling cell survival. This process effectively transports a critical survival signal from its site of release to its site of signaling effect, and does so over a remarkably long distance‚Äîmore than 1 meter in certain sensory neurons. A number of regulators of growth and differentiation, including TGF-B, act on another class of transmembrane receptor enzymes that phosphorylate serine and threonine residues. AN an important regulator of blood volume and vascular tone, acts on a transmembrane receptor whose intracellul domain, a guanylyl cyclase, generates cGMP (see below). Receptors in both groups, like the receptor tyrosine kinases, are active in their dimeric forms.</p>

These receptors $\iota$ a mechanism (Figure 2-8) closely resembling that of receptor tyrosine kinases, except that in this case, the protein tyrosine kinase activity is not intrinsic to the receptor molecule. Instead, a separate protein tyrosine kinase, from the Janus-kinase (JAK) family, binds noncovalently to the receptor. As in the case of the EGFreceptor, cytokine receptors dimerize after they bind the activating ligand, allowing the bound JAKs to become activated and to phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptor. Tyrosine phosphates on the receptor then set motion a complex signaling dance by binding another set of proteins, called STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription). The bound STATs are themselves phosphorylated by the JAKs, two STAT molecules dimerize (attaching to one another's tyrosine phosphates), and finally the STAT/STAT dimer dissociates from th receptor and travels to the nucleus, where it regulates transcription of specific genes.</p>

                            <p>Many of the most useful drugs in clinical medicine act by mimicking or blocking the actions of endogenous ligan that regulate the flow of ions through plasma membrane channels.

                            <p>Each of their receptors transmits its signal across the plasma membrane by increasing transmembrane conductance of the relevant ion and thereby altering the electrical potential across the membrane.

These polypeptides, each of which crosses the lipid bilayer four times, form a cylindric structure 8 nm in diameter.

                            <p>Many extracellular ligands act by increasing the intracellular concentrations of second messengers such as cycli adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), calcium ion, or the phosphoinositides (described below). In most case they use a transmembrane signaling system with three separate components. First, the extracellular ligand is specifically detected by a cell-surface receptor. The receptor in turn triggers the activation of a G protein locate on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. The activated G protein then changes the activity of an effec element, usually an enzyme or ion channel. This element then changes the concentration of the intracellular second messenger. For cAMP, the effector enzyme is adenylyl cyclase, a membrane protein that converts intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cAMP. The corresponding G protein, $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$, stimulates adenylyl cycla: after being activated by hormones and neurotransmitters that act via specific $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$-coupled receptors. There are many examples of such receptors including B-adrenoceptors, glucagon receptors, thyrotropin receptors, and certain subtypes of dopamine and serotonin receptors.</p>
                             <p>$\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$ and other G proteins use a molecular mechanism that involves binding and hydrolysis of GTP (Figure 2-10).</p>

                            <p>The guanine nucleotide-dependent activation-inactivation cycle of G proteins. The agonist activates the receptor (R $\rightarrow$ R*), wh promotes release of GDP from the G protein (G), allowing entry of GTP into the nucleotide binding site. In its GTP-bound sta (G-GTP), the G protein regulates activity of an effector enzyme or ion channel (E). The signal is terminated by hydrolysis of GTP, followed by return of the system to the basal unstimulated state. Open arrows denote regulatory effects. ( $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate.)</p>

                            <p>This mechanism allows the transduced signal to be amplified. For example, a neurotransmitter such as norepinephrine may encounter its membrane receptor for only a few milliseconds. When the encounter generat a GTP-bound $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$ molecule, however, the duration of activation of adenylyl cyclase depends on the longevity of C binding to $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$ rather than on the receptor's affinity for norepinephrine. Indeed, like other G proteins, GTP-bound $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$ may remain active for tens of seconds, enormously amplifying the original signal. This mechanism also helps explain how signaling by G proteins produces the phenomenon of spare receptors (described above). The famil! of G proteins contains several functionally diverse subfamilies (Table 2-1), each of which mediates effects of a particular set of receptors to a distinctive group of effectors. Note that an endogenous ligand (eg, norepinephrir acetylcholine, serotonin, many others not listed in Table 2-1) may bind and stimulate receptors that couple to different subsets of G proteins. The apparent promiscuity of such a ligand allows it to elicit different G proteindependent responses in different cells. For instance, the body responds to danger by using catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine) both to increase heart rate and to induce constriction of blood vessels in the skin, by acting on $G_{s}$ - coupled B-adrenoceptors and $G_{q}$ - coupled $\alpha_{1}$-adrenoceptors, respectively. Ligand promiscuity also offers opportunities in drug development (see Receptor Classes & Drug Development, below).</p>

                            <p>Receptors coupled to G proteins comprise a family of "seven-transmembrane" (7-TM) or "serpentine" receptors so called because the receptor polypeptide chain "snakes" across the plasma membrane seven times (Figure 2-11). Receptors for adrenergic amines, serotonin, acetylcholine (muscarinic but not nicotinic), many peptide hormones, odorants, and even visual receptors (in retinal rod and cone cells) all belong to the serpentine famil) All were derived from a common evolutionary precursor. Several serpentine receptors exist as dimers or larger complexes. Serpentine receptors signal by a different mechanism than receptor tyrosine kinases and cytokine

                             <p>Transmembrane topology of a typical serpentine receptor. The receptor's amino ( N ) terminal is extracellular (above the plan the membrane), and its carboxyl (C) terminal intracellular. The terminals are connected by a polypeptide chain that traverse the plane of the membrane seven times. The hydrophobic transmembrane segments (light color) are designated by roman numerals (I-VII). The agonist (Ag) approaches the receptor from the extracellular fluid and binds to a site surrounded by th transmembrane regions of the receptor protein. G proteins interact with cytoplasmic regions of the receptor, especially with portions of the third cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane regions V and VI. The receptor's cytoplasmic terminal tail contains numerous serine and threonine residues whose hydroxyl (-OH) groups can be phosphorylated. This phosphorylatio may be associated with diminished receptor-G protein interaction.</p>

                             <p>All serpentine receptors transduce signals across the plasma membrane in essentially the same way. Often the agonist ligand‚Äîeg, a catecholamine, acetylcholine, or the photon-activated chromophore of retinal photoreceptors‚Äîis bound in a pocket enclosed by the transmembrane regions of the receptor (as in Figure 2-1 The resulting change in conformation of these regions is transmitted to cytoplasmic loops of the receptor, whick turn activate the appropriate G protein by promoting replacement of GDP by GTP, as described above. Amino acids in the third cytoplasmic loop of the serpentine receptor polypeptide are generally thought to play a key ro in mediating receptor interaction with G proteins (shown by arrows in Figure 2-11).</p>

                             <p>Rapid desensitization and longer-term down-regulation of B-adrenoceptors. Panel A: Response to a B-adrenoceptor agonist (ordinate) versus time (abscissa). Temporal duration of exposure to a constant concentration of agonist is indicated by the light-colored bar. The break in the time axis indicates passage of time in the absence of agonist. Desensitization refers to the reduced cAMP response after several minutes in the continued presence of agonist; restored response is observed after a br period (typically several more minutes) in the absence of agonist. Panel B: Agonist-induced phosphorylation (P) by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) of carboxyl terminal hydroxyl groups (-OH) of the $\bar{B}$-adrenoceptor. This phosphorylation induces binding of a protein, B-arrestin ( B-arr), which prevents the receptor from interacting with $G_{s}$. Removal of agonist for a short period of time (on the order of several minutes) allows dissociation of B-arr, removal of phosphate (Pi) from the receptor by phosphatases (P'ase), and restoration of the receptor's normal responsiveness to agoni! Panel C: Agonist-induced endocytosis and endocytic membrane trafficking of receptors. Beta-arrestin promotes receptor binding to endocytotic structures in the plasma membrane called coated pits. After short-term agonist exposure, receptors primarily undergo dephosphorylation by phosphatases (P'ase) and recycling, promoting rapid recovery of signaling responsiveness. After longer-term agonist exposure, receptors that have undergone endocytosis traffic to lysosomes, promoting the process of receptor down-regulation.

                                 <p>The mechanism mediating rapid desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors often involves receptor phosphorylation, as illustrated by rapid desensitization of the B-adrenoceptor (Figure 2-12, top). The agonistinduced change in conformation of the receptor causes it to bind, activate, and serve as a substrate for a family specific receptor kinases, called G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). The activated GRK then phosphorylates serine residues in the receptor's carboxyl terminal tail. The presence of phosphoserines increasi the receptor's affinity for binding a third protein, $\beta$-arrestin. Binding of $\beta$-arrestin to cytoplasmic loops of the receptor diminishes the receptor's ability to interact with $G_{s}$, thereby reducing the agonist response (ie, stimulation of adenylyl cyclase). Upon removal of agonist, GRK activation is terminated and the desensitization process can be reversed by cellular phosphatases.</p>
                            <p>For the B-adrenoceptor, and many other serpentine receptors, B-arrestin binding also accelerates endocytosis c receptors from the plasma membrane. Endocytosis of receptors promotes their dephosphorylation, by a receptÿå phosphatase that is present at high concentration on endosome membranes, and receptors then return to the plasma membrane. This helps explain the ability of cells to recover receptor-mediated signaling responsiveness very efficiently after agonist-induced desensitization. Several serpentine receptors‚Äîincluding the B -adrenoceptƒ± if it is persistently activated‚Äîinstead traffic to lysosomes after endocytosis and are degraded. This process effectively attenuates (rather than restores) cellular responsiveness, similar to the process of down-regulation described above for the epidermal growth factor receptor. Thus, depending on the particular receptor and duration of activation, endocytosis can contribute to either rapid recovery or prolonged attenuation of cellular responsiveness (Figure 2-12).</p>

In these smooth muscle cells, cGMP synthes can be elevated by two different transmembrane signaling mechanisms utilizing two different guanylyl cyclases. Atrial natriuretic peptide, a blood-borne peptide hormone, stimulates a transmembrane receptor by binding to i extracellular domain, thereby activating the guanylyl cyclase activity that resides in the receptor's intracellular domain. The other mechanism mediates responses to nitric oxide (NO; see Chapter 19), which is generated in vascular endothelial cells in response to natural vasodilator agents such as acetylcholine and histamine. After entering the target cell, NO binds to and activates a cytoplasmic guanylyl cyclase. A number of useful vasodilati drugs, such as nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside used in treating cardiac ischemia and acute hypertension act by generating or mimicking NO. Other drugs produce vasodilation by inhibiting specific phosphodiesterases, thereby interfering with the metabolic breakdown of cGMP.

                             <p>Almost all second messenger signaling involves reversible phosphorylation, which performs two principal functic in signaling: amplification and flexible regulation. In amplification, rather like GTP bound to a G protein, the attachment of a phosphoryl group to a serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue powerfully amplifies the initial regulatory signal by recording a molecular memory that the pathway has been activated; dephosphorylation erases the memory, taking a longer time to do so than is required for dissociation of an allosteric ligand. In flexible regulation, differing substrate specificities of the multiple protein kinases regulated by second messengers provide branch points in signaling pathways that may be independently regulated. In this way, cAN $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, or other second messengers can use the presence or absence of particular kinases or kinase substrates produce quite different effects in different cell types. Inhibitors of protein kinases have great potential as therapeutic agents, particularly in neoplastic diseases. Trastuzumab, an antibody that antagonizes growth factc receptor signaling, was discussed earlier and is a useful therapeutic agent for breast cancer. Another example c this general approach is imatinib, a small molecule inhibitor of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Abl, which is activated by growth factor signaling pathways. Imatinib appears to be very effective for treating chronic myelogenous leukemia, which is caused by a chromosomal translocation event that produces an active Bcr/Abl fusion protein in hematopoietic cells.</p>

Thus, studies of the relation between structure and activity of a series of agonists and antagonists can identify a species of receptor that mediates a set of pharmacologic responses.</p>
                            <p>Exactly the same experimental procedure can show that observed effects of a drug are mediated by different receptors. In this case, effects mediated by different receptors may exhibit different orders of potency among agonists and different $K_{i}$ values for each competitive antagonist.</p>
                            <p>Wherever we look, evolution has created many different receptors that function to mediate responses to any individual chemical signal. In some cases, the same chemical acts on completely different structural receptor classes. For example, acetylcholine uses ligand-gated ion channels (nicotinic AChRs) to initiate a fast excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in postganglionic neurons. Acetylcholine also activates a separate class of G prote coupled receptors (muscarinic AChRs), which modulate responsiveness of the same neurons to the fast EPSP. I addition, each structural class usually includes multiple subtypes of receptor, often with significantly different signaling or regulatory properties. For example, many biogenic amines (eg, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and serotonin) activate more than one receptor, each of which may activate a different G protein, as described abo (see also Table 2-1). The existence of multiple receptor classes and subtypes for the same endogenous ligand I created important opportunities for drug development. For example, propranolol, a selective antagonist of Badrenoceptors, can reduce an accelerated heart rate without preventing the sympathetic nervous system from causing vasoconstriction, an effect mediated by $Q_{1}$ receptors.</p>
                            <p>The principle of drug selectivity may even apply to structurally identical receptors expressed in different cells, e receptors for steroids such as estrogen (Figure 2-6). Different cell types express different accessory proteins, which interact with steroid receptors and change the functional effects of drug-receptor interaction. For exampl tamoxifen acts as an antagonist on estrogen receptors expressed in mammary tissue but as an agonist on estrogen receptors in bone. Consequently, tamoxifen may be useful not only in the treatment and prophylaxis c breast cancer but also in the prevention of osteoporosis by increasing bone density (see Chapters 40 and 42). Tamoxifen may also create complications in postmenopausal women, however, by exerting an agonist action in the uterus, stimulating endometrial cell proliferation.</p>
                            <p>New drug development is not confined to agents that act on receptors for extracellular chemical signals. Pharmaceutical chemists are now determining whether elements of signaling pathways distal to the receptors n may also serve as targets of selective and useful drugs. For example, clinically useful agents might be developed the act selectively on specific G proteins, kinases, phosphatases, or the enzymes that degrade second messengers.</p>
                            <p>Thus, the propensity of drugs to bind to different classes of receptor sites is not only a potentially vexing proble in treating patients, it also presents a continuing challenge to pharmacology and an opportunity for developing new and more useful drugs.</p>

                                             <p>Drugs A and B are said to be more potent than drugs C and D because of the relative positions of their doseresponse curves along the dose axis of Figure 2-15. Potency refers to the concentration ( $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ ) or dose ( $\mathrm{ED}_{50}$ of a drug required to produce 50% of that drug's maximal effect. Thus, the pharmacologic potency of drug A in Figure 2-15 is less than that of drug B , a partial agonist, because the $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ of A is greater than the $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ of B . Potency of a drug depends in part on the affinity ( $K_{d}$ ) of receptors for binding the drug and in part on the efficiency with which drug-receptor interaction is coupled to response. Note that some doses of drug A can produce larger effects than any dose of drug B, despite the fact that we describe drug B as pharmacologically more potent. The reason for this is that drug A has a larger maximal efficacy, as described below.</p>
                                            <p>For clinical use, it is important to distinguish between a drug's potency and its efficacy. The clinical effectivenes of a drug depends not on its potency ( $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ ), but on its maximal efficacy (see below) and its ability to reach the relevant receptors. This ability can depend on its route of administration, absorption, distribution through the body, and clearance from the blood or site of action. In deciding which of two drugs to administer to a patient, prescriber must usually consider their relative effectiveness rather than their relative potency. Pharmacologic
                                                potency can largely determine the administered dose of the chosen drug.</p>

Drugs $A$, $C$, and $D$ in Figl 2-15 have equal maximal efficacy, while all have greater maximal efficacy than drug B. The maximal efficacy (sometimes referred to simply as efficacy) of a drug is obviously crucial for making clinical decisions when a lars response is needed. It may be determined by the drug's mode of interactions with receptors (as with partial agonists, described above)* or by characteristics of the receptor-effector system involved.</p>
                                            <p>Thus, diuretics that act on one portion of the nephron may produce much greater excretion of fluid and electrolytes than diuretics that act elsewhere. In addition, the practical efficacy of a drug for achieving a therapeutic end point (eg, increased cardiac contractility) may be limited by the drug's propensity to cause a to effect (eg, fatal cardiac arrhythmia) even if the drug could otherwise produce a greater therapeutic effect.</p>
                                            <p>* Note that "maximal efficacy," used in a therapeutic context, does not have exactly the same meaning the tern denotes in the more specialized context of drug-receptor interactions described earlier in this chapter. In an idealized in vitro system, efficacy denotes the relative maximal efficacy of agonists and partial agonists that act via the same receptor. In therapeutics, efficacy denotes the extent or degree of an effect that can be achieved the intact patient. Thus, therapeutic efficacy may be affected by the characteristics of a particular drug-recepto interaction, but it also depends on a host of other factors as noted in the text.</p>

For example, such curves may be impossible to construct if the pharmacologic response is an either-or (quantal) event, such as prevention of convulsions, arrhythmia, or death. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of a quantitative dose-response relationship in a single patient, no matter how precisely defined, mas be limited in application to other patients, owing to the great potential variability among patients in severity of disease and responsiveness to drugs.</p>
                                            <p>Some of these difficulties may be avoided by determining the dose of drug required to produce a specified magnitude of effect in a large number of individual patients or experimental animals and plotting the cumulativi frequency distribution of responders versus the log dose (Figure 2-16). The specified quantal effect may be chosen on the basis of clinical relevance (eg, relief of headache) or for preservation of safety of experimental subjects (eg, using low doses of a cardiac stimulant and specifying an increase in heart rate of 20 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$ as the quantal effect), or it may be an inherently quantal event (eg, death of an experimental animal). For most
                                                drugs, the doses required to produce a specified quantal effect in individuals are lognormally distributed; that is frequency distribution of such responses plotted against the log of the dose produces a gaussian normal curve ( variation (colored area, Figure 2-16). When these responses are summated, the resulting cumulative frequenc! distribution constitutes a quantal dose-effect curve (or dose-percent curve) of the proportion or percentage of individuals who exhibit the effect plotted as a function of log dose (Figure 2-16).</p>

                                            <p>The quantal dose-effect curve is often characterized by stating the median effective dose ( $\mathbf{ED}_{\mathbf{50}}$ ), the dose $i$ which 50% of individuals exhibit the specified quantal effect. (Note that the abbreviation $\mathrm{ED}_{50}$ has a different meaning in this context from its meaning in relation to graded dose-effect curves, described above.) Similarly, dose required to produce a particular toxic effect in 50% of animals is called the median toxic dose (TD $\mathbf{50}$ ). I the toxic effect is death of the animal, a median lethal dose ( $\mathbf{L} \mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{5 0}}$ ) may be experimentally defined. Such values provide a convenient way of comparing the potencies of drugs in experimental and clinical settings: Thus the $\mathrm{ED}_{50} \mathrm{~s}$ of two drugs for producing a specified quantal effect are 5 and 500 mg , respectively, then the first drug can be said to be 100 times more potent than the second for that particular effect. Similarly, one can obta a valuable index of the selectivity of a drug's action by comparing its ED50s for two different quantal effects in a population (eg, cough suppression versus sedation for opioid drugs).</p>
                                            <p>Quantal dose-effect curves may also be used to generate information regarding the margin of safety to be
                                                expected from a particular drug used to produce a specified effect. One measure, which relates the dose of a di required to produce a desired effect to that which produces an undesired effect, is the therapeutic index. In animal studies, the therapeutic index is usually defined as the ratio of the $\mathrm{TD}_{50}$ to the $\mathrm{ED}_{50}$ for some therapeutically relevant effect. The precision possible in animal experiments may make it useful to use such a therapeutic index to estimate the potential benefit of a drug in humans. Of course, the therapeutic index of a d/ in humans is almost never known with real precision; instead, drug trials and accumulated clinical experience often reveal a range of usually effective doses and a different (but sometimes overlapping) range of possibly to doses. The clinically acceptable risk of toxicity depends critically on the severity of the disease being treated. Fc example, the dose range that provides relief from an ordinary headache in the great majority of patients shoulc be very much lower than the dose range that produces serious toxicity, even if the toxicity occurs in a small minority of patients. However, for treatment of a lethal disease such as Hodgkin's lymphoma, the acceptable difference between therapeutic and toxic doses may be smaller.</p>
                                            <p>Finally, note that the quantal dose-effect curve and the graded dose-response curve summarize somewhat different sets of information, although both appear sigmoid in shape on a semilogarithmic plot (compare Figure: 2-15 and 2-16). Critical information required for making rational therapeutic decisions can be obtained from ec type of curve. Both curves provide information regarding the potency and selectivity of drugs; the graded do: response curve indicates the maximal efficacy of a drug, and the quantal dose-effect curve indicates the potential variability of responsiveness among individuals.</p>

The idiosyncratic responses are usually caused by genetic differences in metabolism of the drug or by immunologic mechanisms, including allergic reactions.</p>
                            <p>Quantitative variations in drug response are in general more common and more clinically important. An individu patient is hyporeactive or hyperreactive to a drug in that the intensity of effect of a given dose of drug is diminished or increased in comparison to the effect seen in most individuals. (Note: The term hypersensitivit usually refers to allergic or other immunologic responses to drugs.) With some drugs, the intensity of response a given dose may change during the course of therapy; in these cases, responsiveness usually decreases as a consequence of continued drug administration, producing a state of relative tolerance to the drug's effects. When responsiveness diminishes rapidly after administration of a drug, the response is said to be subject to tachyphylaxis.</p>
                            <p>Even before administering the first dose of a drug, the prescriber should consider factors that may help in predicting the direction and extent of possible variations in responsiveness. These include the propensity of a particular drug to produce tolerance or tachyphylaxis as well as the effects of age, sex, body size, disease state genetic factors, and simultaneous administration of other drugs.</p>
                            <p>Four general mechanisms may contribute to variation in drug responsiveness among patients or within an individual patient at different times.</p>

                                 such pharmacokinetic differences may alter the clinical response. Some differences can be predicted on the bas of age, weight, sex, disease state, liver and kidney function, and by testing specifically for genetic differences tl may result from inheritance of a functionally distinctive complement of drug-metabolizing enzymes (see Chapte 3 and 4). Another important mechanism influencing drug availability is active transport of drug from the cytoplasm, mediated by a family of membrane transporters encoded by the so-called multidrug resistance (MDI genes. For example, up-regulation of MDR gene-encoded transporter expression is a major mechanism by whic tumor cells develop resistance to anticancer drugs.</p>

                             <p>Experimental studies have documented changes in drug responsiveness caused by increases or decreases in th number of receptor sites or by alterations in the efficiency of coupling of receptors to distal effector mechanism In some cases, the change in receptor number is caused by other hormones; for example, thyroid hormones increase both the number of Breceptors in rat heart muscle and cardiac sensitivity to catecholamines. Similar changes probably contribute to the tachycardia of thyrotoxicosis in patients and may account for the usefulness propranolol, a B-adrenoceptor antagonist, in ameliorating symptoms of this disease.</p>
                            <p>In other cases, the agonist ligand itself induces a decrease in the number (eg, down-regulation) or coupling efficiency (eg, desensitization) of its receptors. These mechanisms (discussed above, under Signaling Mechanis & Drug Actions) may contribute to two clinically important phenomena: first, tachyphylaxis or tolerance to the effects of some drugs (eg, biogenic amines and their congeners), and second, the "overshoot" phenomena that follow withdrawal of certain drugs. These phenomena can occur with either agonists or antagonists. An antagor may increase the number of receptors in a critical cell or tissue by preventing down-regulation caused by an endogenous agonist. When the antagonist is withdrawn, the elevated number of receptors can produce an exaggerated response to physiologic concentrations of agonist. Potentially disastrous withdrawal symptoms can result for the opposite reason when administration of an agonist drug is discontinued. In this situation, the number of receptors, which has been decreased by drug-induced down-regulation, is too low for endogenous agonist to produce effective stimulation. For example, the withdrawal of clonidine (a drug whose $a_{2}$-adrenocep agonist activity reduces blood pressure) can produce hypertensive crisis, probably because the drug downregulates $\alpha_{2}$-adrenoceptors (see Chapter 11).</p>
                            <p>Genetic factors also can play an important role in altering the number or function of specific receptors. For example, a specific genetic variant of the 2 c -adrenoceptor‚Äîwhen inherited together with a specific variant of the $a_{1}$-adrenoceptor‚Äîconfers increased risk for developing heart failure, which may be reduced by early intervention using antagonist drugs. The identification of such genetic factors, part of the rapidly developing fiel of pharmacogenetics, holds promise for clinical diagnosis and in the future may help physicians design the mosi appropriate pharmacologic therapy for individual patients. Another interesting example of genetic effects on dri response is seen in the treatment of cancers involving excessive growth factor signaling. Somatic mutations affecting the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor confer enhanced sensitivity to kinc
                                inhibitors such as gefitinib in certain lung cancers. This effect enhances the antineoplastic effect of the drug anc because the somatic mutation is specific to the tumor and not present in the host, the therapeutic index of thes drugs can be significantly enhanced in patients whose tumors harbor such somatic mutations.</p>

                            <p>Although a drug initiates its actions by binding to receptors, the response observed in a patient depends on the functional integrity of biochemical processes in the responding cell and physiologic regulation by interacting org systems.

                            <p>Before initiating therapy with a drug, the prescriber should be aware of patient characteristics that may limit th clinical response. These characteristics include the age and general health of the patient and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîthe severity and pathophysiologic mechanism of the disease.

                             <p>Although we classify drugs according to their principal actions, it is clear that no drug causes only a single, spec effect. Why is this so? It is exceedingly unlikely that any kind of drug molecule will bind to only a single type of receptor molecule, if only because the number of potential receptors in every patient is astronomically large. Ev if the chemical structure of a drug allowed it to bind to only one kind of receptor, the biochemical processes controlled by such receptors would take place in multiple cell types and would be coupled to many other biochemical functions; as a result, the patient and the prescriber would probably perceive more than one drug effect. Accordingly, drugs are only selective ‚Äîrather than specific‚Äîin their actions, because they bind to one or few types of receptor more tightly than to others and because these receptors control discrete processes that result in distinct effects.</p>
                            <p>It is only because of their selectivity that drugs are useful in clinical medicine. Selectivity can be measured by comparing binding affinities of a drug to different receptors or by comparing $\mathrm{ED}_{50} \mathrm{~s}$ for different effects of a dru in vivo. In drug development and in clinical medicine, selectivity is usually considered by separating effects into two categories: beneficial or therapeutic effects versus toxic effects. Pharmaceutical advertisements and prescribers occasionally use the term side effect, implying that the effect in question is insignificant or occurs a pathway that is to one side of the principal action of the drug; such implications are frequently erroneous.</p>

In some of these cases (eg, bleeding caused by anticoagulant therapy; hypoglycemic coma due to insulin), toxicity may be avoided by judicious management of the dose of drug administered, guided by careful monitoring of effect (measurements of blood coagulation or serum glucose) and aided by ancillary measures (avoiding tissue trauma that may lead to hemorrhage; regulation of carbohydrate intake). In still oth
                                cases, the toxicity may be avoided by not administering the drug at all, if the therapeutic indication is weak or i other therapy is available.</p>
