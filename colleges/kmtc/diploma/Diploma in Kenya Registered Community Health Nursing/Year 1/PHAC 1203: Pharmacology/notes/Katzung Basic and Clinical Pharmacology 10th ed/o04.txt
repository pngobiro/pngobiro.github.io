\section*{I NTRODUCTION TO THE PHARMACOLOGY OF CNS DRUGS: I NTRODUCTION}

Drugs acting in the central nervous system (CNS) were among the first to be discovered by primitive humans a are still the most widely used group of pharmacologic agents. In addition to their use in therapy, many drugs acting on the CNS are used without prescription to increase one's sense of well-being.

The mechanisms by which various drugs act in the CNS have not always been clearly understood. In the last three decades, however, dramatic advances have been made in the methodology of CNS pharmacology. It is nc possible to study the action of a drug on individual cells and even single ion channels within synapses. The information obtained from such studies is the basis for several major developments in studies of the CNS.

First, it is clear that nearly all drugs with CNS effects act on specific receptors that modulate synaptic transmission. A very few agents such as general anesthetics and alcohol may have nonspecific actions on membranes (although these exceptions are not fully accepted), but even these nonreceptor-mediated actions result in demonstrable alterations in synaptic transmission.

Second, drugs are among the most important tools for studying all aspects of CNS physiology, from the mechanism of convulsions to the laying down of long-term memory. As described below, agonists that mimic natural transmitters (and in many cases are more selective than the endogenous substances) and antagonists i extremely useful in such studies. Natural Toxins: Tools for Characterizing Ion Channels, describes a few of thes substances.

Third, unraveling the actions of drugs with known clinical efficacy has led to some of the most fruitful hypothest regarding the mechanisms of disease. For example, information on the action of antipsychotic drugs on dopami receptors has provided the basis for important hypotheses regarding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Studies of the effects of a variety of agonists and antagonists on $\uparrow$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors has resulted in new concepts pertaining to the pathophysiology of several diseases, including anxiety and epilepsy.

This chapter provides an introduction to the functional organization of the CNS and its synaptic transmitters as basis for understanding the actions of the drugs described in the following chapters.

\section*{Natural Toxins: Tools for Characterizing I on Channels}

Evolution is tireless in the development of natural toxins. A vast number of variations are possible with even a small number of amino acids in peptides, and peptides make up only one of a broad array of toxic compounds. For example, the predatory marine snail genus Conus is estimated to include at least 500 different species. Eac species kills or paralyzes its prey with a venom that contains 50-200 different peptides or proteins. Furthermor there is little duplication of peptides among Conus species. Other animals with useful toxins include snakes, fro! spiders, bees, wasps, and scorpions. Plant species with toxic (or therapeutic) substances are too numerous to mention here; they are referred to in many chapters of this book.

Since many toxins act on ion channels, they provide a wealth of chemical tools for studying the function of thes channels. In fact, much of our current understanding of the properties of ion channels comes from studies utilizing only a small percentage of the highly potent and selective toxins that are now available. The toxins typically target voltage-sensitive ion channels, but a number of very useful toxins block ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors. Table 21-1 lists some of the toxins most commonly used in research, their mode of action, and their source.

\section*{Methods for the Study of CNS Pharmacology}

Like many areas of science, major progress in the study of CNS drugs has depended on the development of nei experimental techniques. The first detailed description of synaptic transmission was made possible by the invention of glass microelectrodes, which permit intracellular recording. The development of the brain slice technique permitted an analysis of the physiology and pharmacology of synapses. Detailed electrophysiologic studies of the action of drugs on both voltage- and transmitter-operated channels were further facilitated by th introduction of the patch clamp technique, which permits the recording of current through single channels. Histochemical, immunologic, and radioisotopic methods have made it possible to map the distribution of specifi, transmitters, their associated enzyme systems, and their receptors. Molecular cloning has had a major impact ( our understanding of CNS receptors. These techniques make it possible to determine the precise molecular structure of the receptors and their associated channels. Finally, mice with mutated genes for specific receptors or enzymes (knockout mice) can provide important information regarding the physiologic and pharmacologic ro of these components.

\section*{I ON CHANNELS \& NEUROTRANSMI TTER RECEPTORS}

The membranes of nerve cells contain two types of channels defined on the basis of the mechanisms controllinc their gating (opening and closing): voltage-gated and ligand-gated channels (Figure 21-1A and B). Voltagegated channels respond to changes in the membrane potential of the cell. The voltage-gated sodium channel described in Chapter 14 for the heart is an example of the first type of channel. In nerve cells, these channels a concentrated on the initial segment and the axon and are responsible for the fast action potential, which transmits the signal from cell body to nerve terminal. There are many types of voltage-sensitive calcium and potassium channels on the cell body, dendrites, and initial segment, which act on a much slower time scale anc modulate the rate at which the neuron discharges. For example, some types of potassium channels opened by depolarization of the cell result in slowing of further depolarization and act as a brake to limit further action potential discharge.

Types of ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors in the CNS. A shows a voltage-gated channel in which a voltage sensc component of the protein controls the gating (broken arrow) of the channel. B shows a ligand-gated channel in which the binding of the neurotransmitter to the ionotropic channel receptor controls the gating (broken arrow) of the channel. C show a G protein-coupled (metabotropic) receptor, which when bound, activates a G protein that then interacts directly with an iol channel. D shows a G protein-coupled receptor, which when bound, activates a G protein that then activates an enzyme. Thi activated enzyme generates a diffusible second messenger, eg, cAMP, which interacts with an ion channel.

Ligand-gated channels, also called ionotropic receptors, are opened by the binding of neurotransmitters to tr channel. The receptor is formed of subunits, and the channel is an integral part of the receptor complex (see Figures 22-6 and 27-1). These channels are insensitive or only weakly sensitive to membrane potential. Activation of these channels typically results in a brief (a few milliseconds to tens of milliseconds) opening of th channel. Ligand-gated channels are responsible for fast synaptic transmission typical of hierarchical pathways ir the CNS (see below).

It is now well established that the traditional view of completely separate voltage-gated and ligand-gated channels requires substantial modifications. As discussed in Chapter 2, most neurotransmitters, in addition to binding to ionotropic receptors, also bind to G protein-coupled receptors, often referred to as metabotropic receptors. Metabotropic receptors, via G proteins, modulate voltage-gated channels. This interaction can occui entirely within the membrane and is then referred to as a membrane delimited pathway (Figure 21-1C). In tl case, the G protein (often the Brsubunit) interacts directly with the voltage-gated ion channel. In general, two types of voltage-gated ion channels are the targets of this type of signaling: calcium channels and potassium channels. When G proteins interact with calcium channels, they inhibit channel function. This mechanism accou for the presynaptic inhibition that occurs when presynaptic metabotropic receptors are activated. In contrast, when these receptors are postsynaptic, they activate (cause the opening of) potassium channels, resulting in a slow postsynaptic inhibition. Metabotropic receptors can also modulate voltage-gated channels less directly by 1 generation of diffusible second messengers (Figure 21-1D). A classic example of this type of action is provided by the Badrenoceptor, which generates cAMP via the activation of adenylyl cyclase (see Chapter 2). Whereas membrane-delimited actions occur within microdomains in the membrane, second messenger-mediat! effects can occur over considerable distances. Finally, an important consequence of the involvement of G protei in receptor signaling is that, in contrast to the brief effect of ionotropic receptors, the effects of metabotropic receptor activation can last tens of seconds to minutes. Metabotropic receptors predominate in the diffuse neuronal systems in the CNS (see below).

\section*{THE SYNAPSE \& SYNAPTI C POTENTI ALS}

The communication between neurons in the CNS occurs through chemical synapses in the vast majority of case (A few instances of electrical coupling between neurons have been documented, and such coupling may play a role in synchronizing neuronal discharge. However, it is unlikely that these electrical synapses are an important site of drug action.) The events involved in synaptic transmission can be summarized as follows.

An action potential in the presynaptic fiber propagates into the synaptic terminal and activates voltage-sensitive calcium channels in the membrane of the terminal (see Figure 6-3). The calcium channels responsible for the release of transmitter are generally resistant to the calcium channel-blocking agents discussed in Chapter 12 (verapamil, etc) but are sensitive to blockade by certain marine toxins and metal ions (see Tables 12-4 and 21-1). Calcium flows into the terminal, and the increase in intraterminal calcium concentration promotes the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. The transmitter contained in the vesicles is releasec into the synaptic cleft and diffuses to the receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. Binding of the transmitter t , its receptor causes a brief change in membrane conductance (permeability to ions) of the postsynaptic cell. The time delay from the arrival of the presynaptic action potential to the onset of the postsynaptic response is approximately 0.5 ms . Most of this delay is consumed by the release process, particularly the time required for calcium channels to open.

The first systematic analysis of synaptic potentials in the CNS was in the early 1950s by Eccles and associates, who recorded intracellularly from spinal motoneurons. When a microelectrode enters a cell, there is a sudden change in the potential recorded by the electrode, which is typically about -70 mV (Figure 21-2). This is the resting membrane potential of the neuron. Two types of pathways-excitatory and inhibitory-impinge on the motoneuron.

Figure 21-2.

Excitatory synaptic potentials and spike generation. The figure shows entry of a microelectrode into a postsynaptic cell and subsequent recording of a resting membrane potential of -70 mV . Stimulation of an excitatory pathway (E) generates transie depolarization. Increasing the stimulus strength (second E) increases the size of the depolarization, so that the threshold for spike generation is reached.

When an excitatory pathway is stimulated, a small depolarization or excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPS is recorded. This potential is due to the excitatory transmitter acting on an ionotropic receptor, causing an increase in sodium and potassium permeability. Changing the stimulus intensity to the pathway and, therefore, the number of presynaptic fibers activated, results in a graded change in the size of the depolarization. When a sufficient number of excitatory fibers are activated, the EPSP depolarizes the postsynaptic cell to threshold, and an all-or-none action potential is generated.

When an inhibitory pathway is stimulated, the postsynaptic membrane is hyperpolarized owing to the selective opening of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels, producing an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (I PSP) (Figure 21-3). However, because the equilibrium potential for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$is only slightly more negative than the resting potential ( $\sim-65 \mathrm{mV}$ ), th hyperpolarization is small and contributes only modestly to the inhibitory action. The opening of the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel during the IPSP makes the neuron "leaky" so that changes in membrane potential are more difficult to achieve. This shunting effect decreases the change in membrane potential during the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). As a result an EPSP that evoked an action potential under resting conditions fails to evoke an action potential during the IPSP (Figure 21-3). A second type of inhibition is termed presynaptic inhibition. It was first described for sensory fibers entering the spinal cord, where excitatory synaptic terminals receive synapses called axoaxonic synapses (described later). When activated, axoaxonic synapses reduce the amount of transmitter released from the terminals of sensory fibers. It is interesting that presynaptic inhibitory receptors i present on virtually all presynaptic terminals in the brain even though axoaxonic synapses appear to be restrict to the spinal cord. In the brain, transmitter spills over to neighboring synapses to activate the presynaptic receptors.

Interaction of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. On the left, a suprathreshold stimulus is given to an excitatory pathway (E and an action potential is evoked. On the right, this same stimulus is given shortly after activating an inhibitory pathway (I), which results in an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) that prevents the excitatory potential from reaching threshold.

\section*{SITES OF DRUG ACTION}

Virtually all of the drugs that act in the CNS produce their effects by modifying some step in chemical synaptic transmission. Figure 21-4 illustrates some of the steps that can be altered. These transmitter-dependent actior can be divided into presynaptic and postsynaptic categories.
Figure 21-4.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-0632.jpg?height=1301&width=831&top_left_y=184&top_left_x=696)

Sites of drug action. Schematic drawing of steps at which drugs can alter synaptic transmission. (1) Action potential in presynaptic fiber; (2) synthesis of transmitter; (3) storage; (4) metabolism; (5) release; (6) reuptake; (7) degradation; (8) receptor for the transmitter; (9) receptor-induced increase or decrease in ionic conductance.

Drugs acting on the synthesis, storage, metabolism, and release of neurotransmitters fall into the presynaptic category. Synaptic transmission can be depressed by blockade of transmitter synthesis or storage. For example reserpine depletes monoamine synapses of transmitter by interfering with intracellular storage. Blockade of transmitter catabolism inside the nerve terminal can increase transmitter concentrations and has been reportec to increase the amount of transmitter released per impulse. Drugs can also alter the release of transmitter. The stimulant amphetamine induces the release of catecholamines from adrenergic synapses (Chapters 6 and 32). Capsaicin causes the release of the peptide substance $P$ from sensory neurons, and tetanus toxin blocks the release of transmitters. After a transmitter has been released into the synaptic cleft, its action is terminated either by uptake or by degradation. For most neurotransmitters, there are uptake mechanisms into the synapti terminal and also into surrounding neuroglia. Cocaine, for example, blocks the uptake of catecholamines at adrenergic synapses and thus potentiates the action of these amines. However, acetylcholine is inactivated by enzymatic degradation, not reuptake. Anticholinesterases block the degradation of acetylcholine and thereby prolong its action. No uptake mechanism has been found for any of the numerous CNS peptides, and it has yet be demonstrated whether specific enzymatic degradation terminates the action of peptide transmitters.

In the postsynaptic region, the transmitter receptor provides the primary site of drug action. Drugs can act eith as neurotransmitter agonists, such as the opioids, which mimic the action of enkephalin, or they can block receptor function. Receptor antagonism is a common mechanism of action for CNS drugs. An example is strychnine's blockade of the receptor for the inhibitory transmitter glycine. This block, which underlies strychnine's convulsant action, illustrates how the blockade of inhibitory processes results in excitation. Drugs c also act directly on the ion channel of ionotropic receptors. For example, barbiturates can enter and block the channel of many excitatory ionotropic receptors. In the case of metabotropic receptors, drugs can act at any of the steps downstream of the receptor. Perhaps the best example is provided by the methylxanthines, which cal modify neurotransmitter responses mediated through the second-messenger cAMP. At high concentrations, the methylxanthines elevate the level of cAMP by blocking its metabolism and thereby prolong its action.

The selectivity of CNS drug action is based almost entirely on the fact that different transmitters are used by different groups of neurons. Furthermore, these transmitters are often segregated into neuronal systems that subserve broadly different CNS functions. Without such segregation, it would be impossible to selectively modif'. CNS function even if one had a drug that operated on a single neurotransmitter system. That such segregation does occur has provided neuroscientists with a powerful pharmacologic approach for analyzing CNS function anı treating pathologic conditions.

\section*{I DENTI FI CATI ON OF CENTRAL NEUROTRANSMI TTERS}

Because drug selectivity is based on the fact that different pathways utilize different transmitters, a primary go of neuropharmacologists is to identify the transmitters in CNS pathways. Establishing that a chemical substance a transmitter has been far more difficult for central synapses than for peripheral synapses. The following criterii have been established for transmitter identification.

\section*{Localization}

Approaches that have been used to prove that a suspected transmitter resides in the presynaptic terminal of th pathway under study include biochemical analysis of regional concentrations of suspected transmitters and immunocytochemical techniques for enzymes and peptides.

\section*{Release}

To determine whether the substance is released from a particular region, local collection (in vivo) of the extracellular fluid can sometimes be accomplished. In addition, slices of brain tissue can be electrically or chemically stimulated in vitro and the released substances measured. To determine whether the release is relevant to synaptic transmission, it is important to establish that the release is calcium-dependent.

\section*{Synaptic Mimicry}

Finally, application of the suspected substance should produce a response that mimics the action of the transmitter released by nerve stimulation. Furthermore, application of a selective antagonist should block the response. Microiontophoresis, which permits highly localized drug administration, has been a valuable techniqui in assessing the action of suspected transmitters. Because of the complexity of the CNS, specific pharmacologic antagonism of a synaptic response provides a particularly powerful technique for transmitter identification.

\section*{CELLULAR ORGANIZATION OF THE BRAI N}

Most of the neuronal systems in the CNS can be divided into two broad categories: hierarchical systems and
nonspecific or diffuse neuronal systems.

\section*{Hierarchical Systems}

Hierarchical systems include all the pathways directly involved in sensory perception and motor control. The pathways are generally clearly delineated, being composed of large myelinated fibers that can often conduct action potentials at a rate in excess of $50 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. The information is typically phasic and occurs in bursts of action potentials. In sensory systems, the information is processed sequentially by successive integrations at each reli nucleus on its way to the cortex. A lesion at any link will incapacitate the system. Within each nucleus and in th cortex, there are two types of cells: relay or projection neurons and local circuit neurons (Figure 21-5A). The projection neurons that form the interconnecting pathways transmit signals over long distances. The cell bodies are relatively large, and their axons emit collaterals that arborize extensively in the vicinity of the neuror These neurons are excitatory, and their synaptic influences, which involve ionotropic receptors, are very shortlived. The excitatory transmitter released from these cells is, in most instances, glutamate. Local circuit neuro are typically smaller than projection neurons, and their axons arborize in the immediate vicinity of the cell body The majority of these neurons are inhibitory, and they release either GABA or glycine. They synapse primarily on the cell body of the projection neurons but can also synapse on the dendrites of projection neurons as well a with each other. Two common types of pathways for these neurons (Figure 21-5A) include recurrent feedback pathways and feed-forward pathways. A special class of local circuit neurons in the spinal cord forms axoaxonic synapses on the terminals of sensory axons (Figure 21-5B). In some sensory pathways such as the retina and olfactory bulb, local circuit neurons may actually lack an axon and release neurotransmitter from dendritic synapses in a graded fashion in the absence of action potentials.

Although there is a great variety of synaptic connections in these hierarchical systems, the fact that a limited number of transmitters are utilized by these neurons indicates that any major pharmacologic manipulation of tr system will have a profound effect on the overall excitability of the CNS. For instance, selectively blocking GABA receptors with a drug such as picrotoxin results in generalized convulsions. Thus, although the mechanism of action of picrotoxin is specific in blocking the effects of GABA, the overall functional effect appears to be quite nonspecific, because GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition is so widely utilized in the brain.

\section*{Nonspecific or Diffuse Neuronal Systems}

Neuronal systems that contain one of the monoamines-norepinephrine, dopamine, or 5-hydroxytryptamine
(serotonin)-provide examples in this category. Certain other pathways emanating from the reticular formation and possibly some peptide-containing pathways also fall into this category. These systems differ in fundamenta ways from the hierarchical systems, and the noradrenergic systems serve to illustrate the differences.

Noradrenergic cell bodies are found primarily in a compact cell group called the locus ceruleus located in the caudal pontine central gray matter. The number of neurons in this cell group is small, approximately 1500 on each side of the brain in the rat.

Because these axons are fine and unmyelinated, they conduct very slowly, at about $0.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. The axons branch repeatedly and are extraordinarily divergent. Branches from the same neuron can innervate several functionall) different parts of the CNS. In the neocortex, these fibers have a tangential organization and therefore can monosynaptically influence large areas of cortex. The pattern of innervation by noradrenergic fibers in the corte and nuclei of the hierarchical systems is diffuse, and these fibers form a very small percentage of the total number in the area. In addition, the axons are studded with periodic enlargements called varicosities, which contain large numbers of vesicles. In some instances, these varicosities do not form synaptic contacts, suggest that norepinephrine may be released in a rather diffuse manner, as occurs with the noradrenergic autonomic innervation of smooth muscle. This indicates that the cellular targets of these systems are determined largely l the location of the receptors rather than by the location of the release sites. Finally, most neurotransmitters utilized by diffuse neuronal systems, including norepinephrine, act—perhaps exclusively-on metabotropic receptors and therefore initiate long-lasting synaptic effects. Based on these observations, it is clear that the monoamine systems cannot be conveying topographically specific types of information; rather, vast areas of th. CNS must be affected simultaneously and in a rather uniform way. It is not surprising, then, that these systems have been implicated in such global functions as sleeping and waking, attention, appetite, and emotional states

\section*{Amino Acids}

The amino acids of primary interest to the pharmacologist fall into two categories: the acidic amino acid glutamate and the neutral amino acids glycine and GABA. All of these compounds are present in high concentrations in the CNS and are extremely potent modifiers of neuronal excitability.

\section*{GLUTAMATE}

Excitatory synaptic transmission is mediated by glutamate, which is present in very high concentrations in excitatory synaptic vesicles ( $\sim 100 \mathrm{mM}$ ). Glutamate is released into the synaptic cleft by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent exocytosis (Figure 21-6). The released glutamate acts on postsynaptic glutamate receptors and is cleared by glutamate transporters present on surrounding glia. In glia, glutamate is converted to glutamine by glutamine synthetase, released from the glia, taken up by the nerve terminal, and converted back to glutamate by the enzyme glutaminase. The high concentration of glutamate in synaptic vesicles is achieved by the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT).

Schematic diagram of a glutamate synapse. Glutamine is imported into the glutamatergic neuron (A) and converted into glutamate by glutaminase. The glutamate is then concentrated in vesicles by the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT). Upon release into the synapse, glutamate can interact with AMPA and NMDA ionotropic receptor channels (AMPAR, NMDAR) the postsynaptic density (PSD) and with metabotropic receptors (MGluR) on the postsynaptic cell (B) . Synaptic transmissio। terminated by active transport of the glutamate into a neighboring glial cell (C) by a glutamate transporter. It is synthesized into glutamine by glutamine synthetase and exported into the glutamatergic axon. (D) shows a model NMDA receptor chann complex consisting of a tetrameric protein that becomes permeable to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ when it binds a glutamate molecule.

Virtually all neurons that have been tested are strongly excited by glutamate. This excitation is caused by the activation of both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors, which have been extensively characterized by molecu cloning. The ionotropic receptors can be further divided into three subtypes based on the action of selective agonists: a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA), kainic acid (KA) and N-methyl- Daspartate (NMDA). All of the ionotropic receptors are composed of four subunits. AMPA receptors, which are present on all neurons, are heterotetramers assembled from four subunits (GluR1-GluR4). The majority of AMP، receptors contain the GluR2 subunit and are permeable to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, but not to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Some AMPA receptors typically present on inhibitory interneurons, lack the GluR2 subunit and are also permeable to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.

Kainate receptors are not as uniformly distributed as AMPA receptors, being expressed at high levels in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and spinal cord. They are formed from a number of subunit combinations (GluR5GluR7, and KA1 and KA2). Although KA1 and KA2 are unable to form channels on their own, their presence in t receptor changes the receptor's affinity and kinetics. Similar to AMPA receptors, kainate receptors are permeab to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and in some subunit combinations can also be permeable to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.

NMDA receptors are as ubiquitous as AMPA receptors, being present on essentially all neurons in the CNS. All NMDA receptors require the presence of the subunit NR1. The channel also contains one or two NR2 subunits (NR2A-D). Unlike AMPA and kainate receptors, all NMDA receptors are highly permeable to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ as well as to N and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. NMDA receptor function is controlled in a number of intriguing ways. In addition to glutamate binding, the channel also requires the binding of glycine to a separate site. The physiologic role for glycine binding is unclear because the glycine site appears to be saturated at normal ambient levels of glycine. Another key difference between AMPA and kainate receptors on the one hand, and NMDA receptors on the other, is that AMI and kainate receptor activation results in channel opening at resting membrane potential, whereas NMDA receptor activation does not. This is due to the voltage-dependent block of the NMDA pore by extracellular Mg ${ }^{2-}$ When the neuron is strongly depolarized, as occurs with intense activation of the synapse or by activation of neighboring synapses, the $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ ion is expelled and the channel opens. Thus, there are two requirements for NMDA receptor channel opening: Glutamate must bind the receptor and the membrane must be depolarized. Tl rise in intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ that accompanies channel opening results in a long-lasting enhancement in synaptic strength that is referred to as long-term potentiation (LTP). The change can last for many hours or even da' and is generally accepted as an important cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory.

The metabotropic glutamate receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that act indirectly on ion channels via G proteins. Metabotropic receptors (mGluR1-mGluR8) have been divided into three groups (I, II, and III). A varie of agonists and antagonists have been developed that interact selectively with the different groups. Group I receptors are typically located postsynaptically and are thought to cause neuronal excitation by activating a nonselective cation channel. These receptors also activate phospholipase C, leading to IP ${ }_{3}$-mediated intracelluli $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release. In contrast, group II and group III receptors are typically located on presynaptic nerve terminals and act as inhibitory autoreceptors. Activation of these receptors causes the inhibition of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels resultin in inhibition of transmitter release. These receptors are activated only when the concentration of glutamate rise to high levels during repetitive stimulation of the synapse. Activation of these receptors causes the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and decreases cAMP generation.

The postsynaptic membrane at excitatory synapses is thickened and referred to as the postsynaptic density (PSD; Figure 21-6). This is a highly complex structure containing glutamate receptors, signaling proteins, scaffolding proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins. A typical excitatory synapse contains AMPA receptors, which ten to be located toward the periphery, and NMDA receptors, which are concentrated in the center. Kainate receptc are present at a subset of excitatory synapses, but their exact location is unknown. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (group I), which are localized just outside the PSD, are also present at some excitatory synapses.

\section*{GABA AND GLYCI NE}

Both GABA and glycine are inhibitory neurotransmitters, which are typically released from local interneurons. Interneurons that release glycine are restricted to the spinal cord and brain stem, whereas interneurons releasi GABA are present throughout the CNS, including the spinal cord. It is interesting that some interneurons in the spinal cord can release both GABA and glycine. Glycine receptors are pentameric structures that are selectively permeable to $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. Strychnine, which is a potent spinal cord convulsant and has been used in some rat poisons,
selectively blocks glycine receptors.
GABA receptors are divided into two main types: $G A B A_{A}$ and $G A B A_{B}$. IPSPs in many areas of the brain have $a f_{i}$ and slow component. The fast component is mediated by $G A B A_{A}$ receptors and the slow component by $G A B A_{B}$ receptors. The difference in kinetics stems from the differences in coupling of the receptors to ion channels. GABA $_{\text {A }}$ receptors are inotropic receptors and, like glycine receptors, are pentameric structures that are selective permeable to $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. These receptors are selectively inhibited by picrotoxin and bicuculline, both of which cause generalized convulsions. A great many subunits for $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptors have been cloned; this accounts for the las diversity in the pharmacology of $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptors, making them key targets for clinically useful agents (see Chapter 22). GABAB receptors are metabotropic receptors that are selectively activated by the antispastic drug baclofen. These receptors are coupled to G proteins that, depending on their cellular location, either inhibit $\mathrm{Ca}^{2}$ channels or activate $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. The $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{B}}$ component of the IPSP is due to a selective increase in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ conductance. This IPSP is long-lasting and slow because the coupling of receptor activation to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel openi is indirect and delayed. $G A B A_{B}$ receptors are localized to the perisynaptic region and thus require the spillover c GABA from the synaptic cleft. GABA ${ }_{B}$ receptors are also present on the axon terminals of many excitatory and inhibitory synapses. In this case, GABA spills over onto these presynaptic GABA receptors, inhibiting transmitte release by inhibiting $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. In addition to their coupling to ion channels, GABA receptors also inhibit adenylyl cyclase and decrease cAMP generation.

\section*{Acetylcholine}

Acetylcholine was the first compound to be identified pharmacologically as a transmitter in the CNS. Eccles showed in the early 1950s that excitation of Renshaw cells by motor axon collaterals in the spinal cord was blocked by nicotinic antagonists. Furthermore, Renshaw cells were extremely sensitive to nicotinic agonists. These experiments were remarkable for two reasons. First, this early success at identifying a transmitter for a central synapse was followed by disappointment because it remained the sole central synapse for which the transmitter was known until the late 1960s, when comparable data became available for GABA and glycine. Second, the motor axon collateral synapse remains one of the best-documented examples of a cholinergic nicotinic synapse in the mammalian CNS, despite the rather widespread distribution of nicotinic receptors as defined by in situ hybridization studies. Most CNS responses to acetylcholine are mediated by a large family of ( protein-coupled muscarinic receptors. At a few sites, acetylcholine causes slow inhibition of the neuron by activating the $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ subtype of receptor, which opens potassium channels. A far more widespread muscarinic actic in response to acetylcholine is a slow excitation that in some cases is mediated by $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ receptors. These muscari effects are much slower than either nicotinic effects on Renshaw cells or the effect of amino acids. Furthermore this $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ muscarinic excitation is unusual in that acetylcholine produces it by decreasing the membrane permeability to potassium, ie, the opposite of conventional transmitter action.

A number of pathways contain acetylcholine, including neurons in the neostriatum, the medial septal nucleus, a the reticular formation. Cholinergic pathways appear to play an important role in cognitive functions, especially memory. Presenile dementia of the Alzheimer type is reportedly associated with a profound loss of cholinergic neurons. However, the specificity of this loss has been questioned because the levels of other putative transmitters, eg, somatostatin, are also decreased.

\section*{Monoamines}

Monoamines include the catecholamines (dopamine and norepinephrine) and 5-hydroxytryptamine. Although these compounds are present in very small amounts in the CNS, they can be localized using extremely sensitive
histochemical methods. These pathways are the site of action of many drugs; for example, the CNS stimulants cocaine and amphetamine appear to act primarily at catecholamine synapses. Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, whereas amphetamines cause presynaptic terminals to release these transmitte

\section*{DOPAMI NE}

The major pathways containing dopamine are the projection linking the substantia nigra to the neostriatum anc the projection linking the ventral tegmental region to limbic structures, particularly the limbic cortex. The therapeutic action of the antiparkinsonism drug levodopa is associated with the former area (Chapter 28), whereas the therapeutic action of the antipsychotic drugs is thought to be associated with the latter (Chapter 2 Dopamine-containing neurons in the tuberobasal ventral hypothalamus play an important role in regulating hypothalamohypophysial function. Five dopamine receptors have been identified, and they fall into two categories: $D_{1}$-like ( $D_{1}$ and $D_{5}$ ) and $D_{2}$-like ( $D_{2}, D_{3}, D_{4}$ ). All dopamine receptors are metabotropic. Dopamir generally exerts a slow inhibitory action on CNS neurons. This action has been best characterized on dopaminecontaining substantia nigra neurons, where $D_{2}$-receptor activation opens potassium channels via the $G_{i}$ couplin protein.

\section*{NOREPINEPHRINE}

Most noradrenergic neurons are located in the locus ceruleus or the lateral tegmental area of the reticular formation. Although the density of fibers innervating various sites differs considerably, most regions of the CNS receive diffuse noradrenergic input. All noradrenergic receptor subtypes are metabotropic. When applied to neurons, norepinephrine can hyperpolarize them by increasing potassium conductance. This effect is mediated $\alpha_{2}$ receptors and has been characterized most thoroughly on locus ceruleus neurons. In many regions of the Cr norepinephrine actually enhances excitatory inputs by both indirect and direct mechanisms. The indirect mechanism involves disinhibition; that is, inhibitory local circuit neurons are inhibited. The direct mechanism involves blockade of potassium conductances that slow neuronal discharge. Depending on the type of neuron, $t$ effect is mediated by either $\alpha_{1}$ or Breceptors. Facilitation of excitatory synaptic transmission is in accordance wi many of the behavioral processes thought to involve noradrenergic pathways, eg, attention and arousal.

\section*{5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMI NE}

Most 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) pathways originate from neurons in the raphe or midline regions o the pons and upper brain stem. 5-HT is contained in unmyelinated fibers that diffusely innervate most regions c the CNS, but the density of the innervation varies. 5-HT acts on more than a dozen receptor subtypes. Except $f$ the $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptor, all of these receptors are metabotropic. The ionotropic $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptor exerts a rapid excitatory action at a very limited number of sites in the CNS. In most areas of the CNS, 5-HT has a strong inhibitory action. This action is mediated by $5-\mathrm{HT}_{1 \mathrm{~A}}$ receptors and is associated with membrane hyperpolarizatic caused by an increase in potassium conductance. It has been found that $5-H T_{1 A}$ receptors and $G A B A_{B}$ receptors share the same potassium channels. Some cell types are slowly excited by 5-HT owing to its blockade of potassium channels via $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ or $5-\mathrm{HT}_{4}$ receptors. Both excitatory and inhibitory actions can occur on the same neuron. It has often been speculated that 5-HT pathways may be involved in the hallucinations induced by LSD since this compound can antagonize the peripheral actions of 5-HT. However, LSD does not appear to be a 5-H antagonist in the CNS, and typical LSD-induced behavior is still seen in animals after raphe nuclei are destroyer Other proposed regulatory functions of 5-HT-containing neurons include sleep, temperature, appetite, and neuroendocrine control.

\section*{Peptides}

A great many CNS peptides have been discovered that produce dramatic effects both on animal behavior and o
the activity of individual neurons. Many of the peptides have been mapped with immunohistochemical techniqui and include opioid peptides (eg, enkephalins, endorphins), neurotensin, substance P, somatostatin, cholecystokinin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, neuropeptide $Y$, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone. As in the peripheral autonomic nervous system, peptides often coexist with a conventional nonpeptide transmitter in the same neuron. A good example of the approaches used to define the role of these peptides in the CNS comes fr studies on substance $P$ and its association with sensory fibers. Substance $P$ is contained in and released from small unmyelinated primary sensory neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem and causes a slow EPSP in targe neurons. These sensory fibers are known to transmit noxious stimuli, and it is therefore surprising that-althou! substance $P$ receptor antagonists can modify responses to certain types of pain-they do not block the respons Glutamate, which is released with substance $P$ from these synapses, presumably plays an important role in transmitting pain stimuli. Substance P is certainly involved in many other functions, because it is found in many areas of the CNS that are unrelated to pain pathways.

Many of these peptides are also found in peripheral structures, including peripheral synapses. They are describı in Chapters 6 and 17.

\section*{Nitric Oxide}

The CNS contains a substantial amount of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which is found within certain classes of neurons. This neuronal NOS is an enzyme activated by calcium-calmodulin, and activation of NMDA receptors, which increases intracellular calcium, results in the generation of nitric oxide. Although a physiologic role for nit। oxide has been clearly established for vascular smooth muscle, its role in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity remains controversial.

\section*{Endocannabinoids}

The primary psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, $\Delta^{9}$-tetrahydrocannabinol ( $\Delta^{9}-\mathrm{THC}$ ), affects the brain mainly I activating a specific cannabinoid receptor, CB1. CB1 is expressed at high levels in many brain regions, and several endogenous brain lipids, including anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol, have been identified as CB1 ligands. These ligands are not stored, as are classic neurotransmitters, but instead are rapidly synthesized by neurons in response to depolarization and consequent calcium influx. In further contradistinction to classic neurotransmitters, endogenous cannabinoids can function as retrograde synaptic messengers: They are releast from postsynaptic neurons and travel backward across synapses, activating CB1 receptors on presynaptic neurons and suppressing transmitter release. Cannabinoids may affect memory, cognition, and pain perception by this mechanism.

\section*{SEDATI VE-HYPNOTI C DRUGS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Assignment of a drug to the sedative-hypnotic class indicates that it is able to cause sedation (with concomitant relief of anxiety) or to encourage sleep. Because there is considerable chemical variation within the group, this drug classification is based on clinical uses rather than on similarities in chemical structure. Anxiety states and sleep disorders are common problems, and sedative-hypnotics are widely prescribed drugs worldwide.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF SEDATI VE-HYPNOTI CS}

An effective sedative (anxiolytic) agent should reduce anxiety and exert a calming effect. The degree of central nervous system depression caused by a sedative should be the minimum consistent with therapeutic efficacy. A hypnotic drug should produce drowsiness and encourage the onset and maintenance of a state of sleep. Hypnotic effects involve more pronounced depression of the central nervous system than sedation, and this can be achieved with many drugs in this class simply by increasing the dose. Graded dose-dependent depression of central nervous system function is a characteristic of most sedative-hypnotics. However, individual drugs differ in the relationship between the dose and the degree of central nervous system depression. Two examples of such dose-response relationships are shown in Figure 22-1. The linear slope for drug A is typical of many of the older sedative-hypnotics, including the barbiturates and alcohols. With such drugs, an increase in dose higher than that needed for hypnosis may lead to a state of general anesthesia. At still higher doses, these sedative-hypnotics may depress respiratory and vasomotor centers in the medulla, leading to coma and death. Deviations from a linear dose-response relationship, as shown for drug B, require proportionately greater dosage increments to achieve central nervous system depression more profound than hypnosis. This appears to be the case for benzodiazepines and for certain newer hypnotics that have a similar mechanism of action.

\section*{CHEMI CAL CLASSI FI CATI ON}

The benzodiazepines are widely used sedative-hypnotics. All of the structures shown in Figure 22-2 are 1,4-benzodiazepines, and most contain a carboxamide group in the 7 -membered heterocyclic ring structure. A substituent in the 7 position, such as a halogen or a nitro group, is required for sedativehypnotic activity.

The chemical structures of some older and less commonly used sedative-hypnotics, including several barbiturates, are shown in Figure 22-3. Glutethimide and meprobamate are of distinctive chemical structure but are practically equivalent to barbiturates in their pharmacologic effects. Their clinical use is rapidly declining. The sedative-hypnotic class also includes compounds of simpler chemical structure,
including ethanol (see Chapter 23) and chloral hydrate.

Chemical structures of barbiturates and other sedative-hypnotics.

Several drugs with novel chemical structures have been introduced more recently for use in sleep disorders. Zolpidem, an imidazopyridine, zaleplon, a pyrazolopyrimidine, and eszopiclone, a cyclopyrrolone (Figure 22-4), although structurally unrelated to benzodiazepines, share a similar mechanism of action, as described below. Eszopiclone is the ( S )-enantiomer of zopiclone, a hypnotic drug that has been available outside the United States since 1989. Ramelteon, a melatonin receptor agonist, is a new hypnotic drug (see Ramelteon). Buspirone is a slow-onset anxiolytic agent whose actions are quite different from those of conventional sedative-hypnotics (see Buspirone).

Chemical structures of newer hypnotics.
Other classes of drugs that exert sedative effects include antipsychotics (Chapter 29), and many antidepressant drugs (Chapter 30). The latter are currently used widely in management of chronic anxiety disorders. Certain antihistaminic agents including hydroxyzine and promethazine (Chapter 16) are also sedating. These agents commonly also exert marked effects on the peripheral autonomic nervous system. Certain antihistaminics with sedative effects are available in over-the-counter sleep aids.

\section*{Ramelteon}

Melatonin receptors are thought to be involved in maintaining circadian rhythms underlying the sleep-wake cycle (Chapter 16). Ramelteon, a novel hypnotic drug prescribed specifically for patients who have difficulty in falling asleep, is an agonist at $\mathrm{MT}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{MT}_{2}$ melatonin receptors located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the brain. The drug has no direct effects on GABAergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system. In polysomnography studies of patients with chronic insomnia, ramelteon reportedly reduced the latency to persistent sleep with no rebound insomnia or withdrawal symptoms. The drug is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, forming an active metabolite with longer half-life (2-5 hours) than the parent drug. The CYP1A2 isoform of cytochrome P450 is mainly responsible for the metabolism of ramelteon; the drug should not be used with fluvoxamine (an inhibitor of CYP1A2) and should be used with caution in patients with liver dysfunction. Adverse effects of ramelteon include dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, and endocrine changes as well as decreases in testosterone and increases in prolactin. Ramelteon is not a controlled substance.

\section*{Buspirone}

Buspirone has selective anxiolytic effects, and its pharmacologic characteristics are different from those of other drugs described in this chapter. Buspirone relieves anxiety without causing marked sedative, hypnotic, or euphoric effects. Unlike benzodiazepines, the drug has no anticonvulsant or muscle relaxant properties. Buspirone does not interact directly with GABAergic systems. It may exert its anxiolytic effects by acting as a partial agonist at brain 5$\mathrm{HT}_{1 \mathrm{~A}}$ receptors, but it also has affinity for brain dopamine $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ receptors. Buspirone-treated patients show no rebound anxiety or withdrawal signs on abrupt discontinuance. The drug is not effective in blocking the acute withdrawal syndrome resulting from abrupt cessation of use of benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics. Buspirone has minimal abuse liability. In marked contrast to the benzodiazepines, the anxiolytic effects of buspirone may take more than a week to become established, making the drug unsuitable for management of acute anxiety states. The drug is used in generalized anxiety states but is less effective in panic disorders.

Buspirone is rapidly absorbed orally but undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism via hydroxylation and dealkylation reactions to form several active metabolites. The major metabolite is 1-(2-pyrimidyl)-piperazine (1-PP), which has $a_{2}$-adrenoceptor-blocking actions and which enters the central nervous system to reach higher levels than the parent drug. It is not known what role (if any) 1-PP plays in the central actions of buspirone. The elimination half-life of buspirone is 2-4 hours, and liver dysfunction may slow its clearance. Rifampin, an inducer of cytochrome P450, decreases the half-life of buspirone; inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg, erythromycin, ketoconazole) increase its plasma levels.

Buspirone causes less psychomotor impairment than benzodiazepines and does not affect driving skills. The drug does not potentiate effects of conventional sedative-hypnotic drugs, ethanol, or tricyclic antidepressants, and elderly patients do not appear to be more sensitive to its actions. Tachycardia, palpitations, nervousness, gastrointestinal distress, and paresthesias
and a dose-dependent pupillary constriction may occur. Blood pressure may be elevated in patients receiving MAO inhibitors.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

\section*{ABSORPTION AND DISTRIBUTION}

The rates of oral absorption of sedative-hypnotics differ depending on a number of factors, including lipophilicity. For example, the absorption of triazolam is extremely rapid, and that of diazepam and the active metabolite of clorazepate is more rapid than other commonly used benzodiazepines.
Clorazepate, a prodrug, is converted to its active form, desmethyldiazepam (nordiazepam), by acid hydrolysis in the stomach. Most of the barbiturates and other older sedative-hypnotics, as well as the newer hypnotics (eszopiclone, zaleplon, zolpidem), are absorbed rapidly into the blood following oral administration.

Lipid solubility plays a major role in determining the rate at which a particular sedative-hypnotic enters the central nervous system. This property is responsible for the rapid onset of central nervous system effects of triazolam, thiopental (Chapter 25), and the newer hypnotics.

All sedative-hypnotics cross the placental barrier during pregnancy. If sedative-hypnotics are given during the predelivery period, they may contribute to the depression of neonatal vital functions. Sedative-hypnotics are also detectable in breast milk and may exert depressant effects in the nursing infant.

\section*{BI OTRANSFORMATI ON}

Metabolic transformation to more water-soluble metabolites is necessary for clearance of sedativehypnotics from the body. The microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme systems of the liver are most important in this regard. Few sedative-hypnotics are excreted from the body in unchanged form, so elimination half-life depends mainly on the rate of metabolic transformation.

\section*{Benzodiazepines}

Hepatic metabolism accounts for the clearance of all benzodiazepines. The patterns and rates of metabolism depend on the individual drugs. Most benzodiazepines undergo microsomal oxidation (phase I reactions), including N-dealkylation and aliphatic hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 isozymes, especially CYP3A4. The metabolites are subsequently conjugated (phase II reactions) to form glucuronides that are excreted in the urine. However, many phase I metabolites of benzodiazepines are pharmacologically active, some with long half-lives (Figure 22-5). For example, desmethyldiazepam, which has an elimination half-life of more than 40 hours, is an active metabolite of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, prazepam, and clorazepate. Alprazolam and triazolam undergo a.hydroxylation, and the resulting metabolites appear to exert short-lived pharmacologic effects because they are rapidly conjugated to form inactive glucuronides. The short elimination half-life of triazolam ( $2-3$ hours) favors its use as a hypnotic rather than as a sedative drug.

Figure 22-5.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-0655.jpg?height=1255&width=1678&top_left_y=332&top_left_x=221)

The formation of active metabolites has complicated studies on the pharmacokinetics of the benzodiazepines in humans because the elimination half-life of the parent drug may have little relation to the time course of pharmacologic effects. Benzodiazepines for which the parent drug or active metabolites have long half-lives are more likely to cause cumulative effects with multiple doses. Cumulative and residual effects such as excessive drowsiness appear to be less of a problem with such drugs as estazolam, oxazepam, and lorazepam, which have relatively short half-lives and are metabolized directly to inactive glucuronides. Some pharmacokinetic properties of selected benzodiazepines are listed in Table 22-1. The metabolism of several commonly used benzodiazepines including diazepam, midazolam, and triazolam is affected by inhibitors and inducers of hepatic P450 isozymes (see Chapter 4).

\section*{Barbiturates}

With the exception of phenobarbital, only insignificant quantities of the barbiturates are excreted unchanged. The major metabolic pathways involve oxidation by hepatic enzymes to form alcohols, acids, and ketones, which appear in the urine as glucuronide conjugates. The overall rate of hepatic metabolism in humans depends on the individual drug but (with the exception of the thiobarbiturates) is usually slow. The elimination half-lives of secobarbital and pentobarbital range from 18 to 48 hours in different individuals. The elimination half-life of phenobarbital in humans is 4-5 days. Multiple dosing with these agents can lead to cumulative effects.

\section*{Newer Hypnotics}

After oral administration of the standard formulation, zolpidem reaches peak plasma levels in 1.6 hours. A biphasic release formulation extends plasma levels by approximately 2 hours. Zolpidem is rapidly metabolized to inactive metabolites via oxidation and hydroxylation by hepatic cytochromes P450 including the CYP3A4 isozyme. The elimination half-life of the drug is 1.5-3.5 hours, with clearance decreased in elderly patients. Zaleplon is metabolized to inactive metabolites mainly by hepatic aldehyde oxidase and partly by the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP3A4. The half-life of the drug is about 1 hour. Dosage should be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment and in the elderly. Cimetidine, which inhibits both aldehyde dehydrogenase and CYP3A4, markedly increases the peak plasma level of zaleplon. Eszopiclone is metabolized by hepatic cytochromes P450 (especially CYP3A4) to form the inactive N -oxide derivative and weakly active desmethyleszopiclone. The elimination halflife of eszopiclone is approximately 6 hours and is prolonged in the elderly and in the presence of inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole). Inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, rifampin) increase the hepatic metabolism of eszopiclone.

\section*{EXCRETION}

The water-soluble metabolites of sedative-hypnotics, mostly formed via the conjugation of phase I metabolites, are excreted mainly via the kidney. In most cases, changes in renal function do not have a marked effect on the elimination of parent drugs. Phenobarbital is excreted unchanged in the urine to a certain extent (20-30\% in humans), and its elimination rate can be increased significantly by alkalinization of the urine. This is partly due to increased ionization at alkaline pH , since phenobarbital is a weak acid with a $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}$ of 7.4.

\section*{FACTORS AFFECTING BIODISPOSITION}

The biodisposition of sedative-hypnotics can be influenced by several factors, particularly alterations in hepatic function resulting from disease or drug-induced increases or decreases in microsomal enzyme activities (see Chapter 4).

In very old patients and in patients with severe liver disease, the elimination half-lives of these drugs are often increased significantly. In such cases, multiple normal doses of these sedative-hypnotics can result in excessive central nervous system effects.

The activity of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzymes may be increased in patients exposed to certain older sedative-hypnotics on a long-term basis (enzyme induction; see Chapter 4). Barbiturates (especially phenobarbital) and meprobamate are most likely to cause this effect, which may result in an increase in their hepatic metabolism as well as that of other drugs. Increased biotransformation of other pharmacologic agents as a result of enzyme induction by barbiturates is a potential mechanism underlying drug interactions (Appendix II). In contrast, benzodiazepines and the newer hypnotics do not change hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme activity with continuous use.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics of Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates, \& Newer Hypnotics MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY OF THE GABAA RECEPTOR}

The benzodiazepines, the barbiturates, zolpidem, zaleplon, eszopiclone, and many other drugs bind to molecular components of the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor in neuronal membranes in the central nervous system. This receptor, which functions as a chloride ion channel, is activated by the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (see Chapter 21).

The $G A B A_{A}$ receptor has a pentameric structure assembled from five subunits (each with four transmembrane-spanning domains) selected from multiple polypeptide classes ( $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, \varepsilon, \pi, \rho$, etc). Multiple subunits of several of these classes have been characterized, eg, six different $\alpha$, four $B$, and three $\gamma$. A model of the hypothetical $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor-chloride ion channel macromolecular complex is shown in Figure 22-6.

Figure 22-6.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-0658.jpg?height=831&width=879&top_left_y=590&top_left_x=612)

A model of the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor-chloride ion channel macromolecular complex (others could be proposed). A heterooligomeric glycoprotein, the complex consists of five or more membrane-spanning subunits. Multiple forms of $Q$, $B$, and $\gamma_{\text {subunits }}$ are arranged in different pentameric combinations so that $\mathrm{GABA}_{A}$ receptors exhibit molecular heterogeneity. GABA appears to interact with cor Bsubunits triggering chloride channel opening with resulting membrane hyperpolarization. Binding of benzodiazepines to 'subunits or to an area of the cunit influenced by the 'runit facilitates the process of channel opening but does not directly initiate chloride current. (Modified and reproduced, with permission, from Zorumski CF, Isenberg KE: Insights into the structure and function of GABA receptors: Ion channels and psychiatry. Am J Psychiatry 1991; 148: 162.)

A major isoform of the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor that is found in many regions of the brain consists of two $\mathrm{a}_{1}$ and two $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ subunits and one $\gamma_{2}$ subunit. In this isoform, the binding sites for GABA are located between adjacent $\alpha_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ subunits, and the binding pocket for benzodiazepines (the $\mathbf{B Z}$ site of the GABA receptor) is between an $\alpha_{1}$ and the $\gamma_{2}$ subunit. However, $G A B A_{A}$ receptors in different areas of the central nervous system consist of various combinations of the essential subunits, and the benzodiazepines bind to many of these, including receptor isoforms containing $\alpha_{2}, \alpha_{3}$, and $\alpha_{5}$ subunits. Barbiturates also bind to multiple isoforms of the GABA $_{\text {A }}$ receptor but at different sites from those with which benzodiazepines interact. In contrast to benzodiazepines, zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone bind more selectively because these drugs interact only with GABA ${ }_{A}$-receptor isoforms that contain ${ }_{1}$
subunits. The heterogeneity of $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptors may constitute the molecular basis for the varied pharmacologic actions of benzodiazepines and related drugs (see GABA Receptor Heterogeneity \& Pharmacologic Selectivity).

In contrast to GABA itself, benzodiazepines and other sedative-hypnotics have a low affinity for $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{B}}$ receptors, which are activated by the spasmolytic drug baclofen (see Chapters 21 and 27).

\section*{NEUROPHARMACOLOGY}

GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (Chapter 21). Electrophysiologic studies have shown that benzodiazepines potentiate GABAergic inhibition at all levels of the neuraxis, including the spinal cord, hypothalamus, hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellar cortex, and cerebral cortex. Benzodiazepines appear to increase the efficiency of GABAergic synaptic inhibition. The benzodiazepines do not substitute for GABA but appear to enhance GABA's effects allosterically without directly activating GABA receptors or opening the associated chloride channels. The enhancement in chloride ion conductance induced by the interaction of benzodiazepines with GABA takes the form of an increase in the frequency of channelopening events.

Barbiturates also facilitate the actions of GABA at multiple sites in the central nervous system, but-in contrast to benzodiazepines-they appear to increase the duration of the GABA-gated chloride channel openings. At high concentrations, the barbiturates may also be GABA-mimetic, directly activating chloride channels. These effects involve a binding site or sites distinct from the benzodiazepine binding sites. Barbiturates are less selective in their actions than benzodiazepines, because they also depress the actions of excitatory neurotransmitters (eg, glutamic acid) and exert nonsynaptic membrane effects in parallel with their effects on GABA neurotransmission. This multiplicity of sites of action of barbiturates may be the basis for their ability to induce full surgical anesthesia (see Chapter 25) and for their more pronounced central depressant effects (which result in their low margin of safety) compared with benzodiazepines and the newer hypnotics.

\section*{GABA Receptor Heterogeneity \& Pharmacologic Selectivity}

Studies involving genetically engineered mice have demonstrated that the specific pharmacologic actions elicited by benzodiazepines and other drugs that modulate GABA actions are influenced by the composition of the subunits assembled to form the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor. Benzodiazepines interact only with brain $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptors in which the asubunits ( $1,2,3$, and 5 ) have a conserved histidine residue in the N -terminal domain. Strains of mice, in which a point mutation has been inserted converting histidine to arginine in the subunit, show resistance to both the sedative and amnestic effects of benzodiazepines, but anxiolytic and musclerelaxing effects are largely unchanged. These animals are also unresponsive to the hypnotic actions of zolpidem and zaleplon, drugs that bind selectively to GABA receptors containing $\alpha_{1}$ subunits. In contrast, mice with selective histidine-arginine mutations in the $x_{2}$ subunit of GABA $_{\text {A }}$ receptors show selective resistance to the antianxiety effects of benzodiazepines. Based on studies of this type, it has been suggested that $\alpha_{1}$ subunits in $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptors mediate sedation, amnesia, and possibly antiseizure effects of benzodiazepines, whereas $\alpha_{2}$ subunits are involved in their anxiolytic and muscle-relaxing actions. Other mutation studies have led to suggestions that an $\alpha_{5}$ subtype is involved in at least some of the memory impairment caused by benzodiazepines. It should be noted that these studies involving genetic manipulations of
the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor utilize rodent models of the anxiolytic and amnestic actions of drugs.

\section*{BENZODI AZEPI NE BINDING SITE LIGANDS}

The components of the GABA receptor-chloride ion channel macromolecule that function as benzodiazepine binding sites exhibit heterogeneity (see The Versatility of the Chloride Channel GABA Receptor Complex). Three types of ligand-benzodiazepine receptor interactions have been reported:
(1) Agonists facilitate GABA actions, and this occurs at multiple BZ binding sites in the case of the benzodiazepines. As noted above, the nonbenzodiazepines zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone are selective agonists at the BZ sites that contain an $\alpha_{1}$ subunit. Endogenous agonist ligands for the BZ binding sites have been proposed, because benzodiazepine-like chemicals have been isolated from brain tissue of animals never exposed to these drugs. Nonbenzodiazepine molecules that have affinity for BZ sites on the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor have also been detected in human brain. (2) Antagonists are typified by the synthetic benzodiazepine derivative flumazenil, which blocks the actions of benzodiazepines, eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem but does not antagonize the actions of barbiturates, meprobamate, or ethanol. Certain endogenous neuropeptides are also capable of blocking the interaction of benzodiazepines with BZ binding sites. (3) I nverse agonists act as negative allosteric modulators of GABA-receptor function. Their interaction with BZ sites on the GABA receptor can produce anxiety and seizures, an action that has been demonstrated for several compounds, especially the B-carbolines, eg, n-butyl-B-carboline-3-carboxylate (B-CCB). In addition to their direct actions, these molecules can block the effects of benzodiazepines.

The physiologic significance of endogenous modulators of the functions of GABA in the central nervous system remains unclear. To date, it has not been established that the putative endogenous ligands of BZ binding sites play a role in the control of states of anxiety, sleep patterns, or any other characteristic behavioral expression of central nervous system function.

\section*{The Versatility of the Chloride Channel GABA Receptor Complex}

The GABA ${ }_{\text {A }}$-chloride channel macromolecular complex is one of the most versatile drugresponsive machines in the body. In addition to the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and the newer hypnotics (eg, zolpidem), many other drugs with central nervous system effects can modify the function of this important ionotropic receptor. These include alcohol; alphaxolone, etomidate, and propofol (intravenous anesthetics); volatile anesthetics (eg, halothane); several anticonvulsants (eg, gabapentin, vigabatrin); and ivermectin (an anthelmintic agent). Most of these agents facilitate or mimic the action of GABA. (It has not been shown that these drugs act exclusively or even primarily by this mechanism.) Central nervous system excitatory agents that act on the chloride channel include picrotoxin and bicuculline. These convulsant drugs block the channel directly (picrotoxin) or interfere with GABA binding (bicuculline).

\section*{ORGAN LEVEL EFFECTS}

\section*{Sedation}

Benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and most older sedative-hypnotic drugs exert calming effects with concomitant reduction of anxiety at relatively low doses. In most cases, however, the anxiolytic actions of sedative-hypnotics are accompanied by some depressant effects on psychomotor and cognitive functions. In experimental animal models, benzodiazepines and older sedative-hypnotic drugs are able to disinhibit punishment-suppressed behavior. This disinhibition has been equated with antianxiety effects of sedative-hypnotics, and it is not a characteristic of all drugs that have sedative effects, eg,
the tricyclic antidepressants and antihistamines. However, the disinhibition of previously suppressed behavior may be more related to behavioral disinhibitory effects of sedative-hypnotics, including euphoria, impaired judgment, and loss of self-control, which can occur at dosages in the range of those used for management of anxiety. The benzodiazepines also exert dose-dependent anterograde amnesic effects (inability to remember events occurring during the drug's duration of action).

\section*{Hypnosis}

By definition, all of the sedative-hypnotics induce sleep if high enough doses are given. The effects of sedative-hypnotics on the stages of sleep depend on several factors, including the specific drug, the dose, and the frequency of its administration. The general effects of benzodiazepines and older sedative-hypnotics on patterns of normal sleep are as follows: (1) the latency of sleep onset is decreased (time to fall asleep); (2) the duration of stage 2 NREM sleep is increased; (3) the duration of REM sleep is decreased; and (4) the duration of stage 4 NREM slow-wave sleep is decreased. The newer hypnotics all decrease the latency to persistent sleep. Zolpidem decreases REM sleep but has minimal effect on slow-wave sleep. Zaleplon decreases the latency of sleep onset with little effect on total sleep time, NREM, or REM sleep. Eszopiclone increases total sleep time, mainly via increases in stage 2 NREM sleep, and at low doses has little effect on sleep patterns. At the highest recommended dose, eszopiclone decreases REM sleep.

More rapid onset of sleep and prolongation of stage 2 are presumably clinically useful effects. However, the significance of sedative-hypnotic drug effects on REM and slow-wave sleep is not clear. Deliberate interruption of REM sleep causes anxiety and irritability followed by a rebound increase in REM sleep at the end of the experiment. A similar pattern of "REM rebound" can be detected following abrupt cessation of drug treatment with older sedative-hypnotics, especially when drugs with short durations of action (eg, triazolam) are used at high doses. With respect to zolpidem and the other newer hypnotics, there is little evidence of REM rebound when these drugs are discontinued after use of recommended doses. However, rebound insomnia occurs with both zolpidem and zaleplon if used at higher doses. Despite possible reductions in slow-wave sleep, there are no reports of disturbances in the secretion of pituitary or adrenal hormones when either barbiturates or benzodiazepines are used as hypnotics. The use of sedative-hypnotics for more than 1-2 weeks leads to some tolerance to their effects on sleep patterns.

\section*{Anesthesia}

As shown in Figure 22-1, high doses of certain sedative-hypnotics depress the central nervous system to the point known as stage III of general anesthesia (see Chapter 25). However, the suitability of a particular agent as an adjunct in anesthesia depends mainly on the physicochemical properties that determine its rapidity of onset and duration of effect. Among the barbiturates, thiopental and methohexital are very lipid-soluble, penetrating brain tissue rapidly following intravenous administration, a characteristic favoring their use for the induction of anesthesia. Rapid tissue redistribution (not rapid elimination) accounts for the short duration of action of these drugs, a feature useful in recovery from anesthesia.

Benzodiazepines—including diazepam, lorazepam, and midazolam—are used intravenously in anesthesia (see Chapter 25), often in combination with other agents. Not surprisingly, benzodiazepines given in large doses as adjuncts to general anesthetics may contribute to a persistent postanesthetic respiratory depression. This is probably related to their relatively long half-lives and the formation of
active metabolites. However, such depressant actions of the benzodiazepines are usually reversible with flumazenil.

\section*{Anticonvulsant Effects}

Many sedative-hypnotics are capable of inhibiting the development and spread of epileptiform electrical activity in the central nervous system. Some selectivity exists in that some members of the group can exert anticonvulsant effects without marked central nervous system depression (although psychomotor function may be impaired). Several benzodiazepines-including clonazepam, nitrazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam-are sufficiently selective to be clinically useful in the management of seizures (see Chapter 24). Of the barbiturates, phenobarbital and metharbital (converted to phenobarbital in the body) are effective in the treatment of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone lack anticonvulsant activity, presumably because of their more selective binding than that of benzodiazepines to $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor isoforms.

\section*{Muscle Relaxation}

Some sedative-hypnotics, particularly members of the carbamate (eg, meprobamate) and benzodiazepine groups, exert inhibitory effects on polysynaptic reflexes and internuncial transmission and at high doses may also depress transmission at the skeletal neuromuscular junction. Somewhat selective actions of this type that lead to muscle relaxation can be readily demonstrated in animals and have led to claims of usefulness for relaxing contracted voluntary muscle in muscle spasm (see Clinical Pharmacology). Muscle relaxation is not a characteristic action of zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone.

\section*{Effects on Respiration and Cardiovascular Function}

At hypnotic doses in healthy patients, the effects of sedative-hypnotics on respiration are comparable to changes during natural sleep. However, even at therapeutic doses, sedative-hypnotics can produce significant respiratory depression in patients with pulmonary disease. Effects on respiration are doserelated, and depression of the medullary respiratory center is the usual cause of death due to overdose of sedative-hypnotics.

At doses up to those causing hypnosis, no significant effects on the cardiovascular system are observed in healthy patients. However, in hypovolemic states, heart failure, and other diseases that impair cardiovascular function, normal doses of sedative-hypnotics may cause cardiovascular depression, probably as a result of actions on the medullary vasomotor centers. At toxic doses, myocardial contractility and vascular tone may both be depressed by central and peripheral effects, leading to circulatory collapse. Respiratory and cardiovascular effects are more marked when sedative-hypnotics are given intravenously.

\section*{Tolerance; Psychologic \& Physiologic Dependence}

Tolerance-decreased responsiveness to a drug following repeated exposure-is a common feature of sedative-hypnotic use. It may result in the need for an increase in the dose required to maintain symptomatic improvement or to promote sleep. It is important to recognize that partial cross-tolerance occurs between the sedative-hypnotics described here and also with ethanol (Chapter 23)-a feature of some clinical importance, as explained below. The mechanisms responsible for tolerance to sedativehypnotics are not well understood. An increase in the rate of drug metabolism (metabolic tolerance) may be partly responsible in the case of chronic administration of barbiturates, but changes in responsiveness of the central nervous system (pharmacodynamic tolerance) are of greater importance
for most sedative-hypnotics. In the case of benzodiazepines, the development of tolerance in animals has been associated with down-regulation of brain benzodiazepine receptors. Tolerance has been reported to occur with the extended use of zolpidem. Minimal tolerance was observed with the use of zaleplon over a 5-week period and eszopiclone over a 6-month period.

The perceived desirable properties of relief of anxiety, euphoria, disinhibition, and promotion of sleep have led to the compulsive misuse of virtually all sedative-hypnotics. (See Chapter 32 for a detailed discussion.) For this reason, most sedative-hypnotic drugs are classified as Schedule III or Schedule IV drugs for prescribing purposes. The consequences of abuse of these agents can be defined in both psychologic and physiologic terms. The psychologic component may initially parallel simple neurotic behavior patterns difficult to differentiate from those of the inveterate coffee drinker or cigarette smoker. When the pattern of sedative-hypnotic use becomes compulsive, more serious complications develop, including physiologic dependence and tolerance.

Physiologic dependence can be described as an altered physiologic state that requires continuous drug administration to prevent an abstinence or withdrawal syndrome. In the case of sedative-hypnotics, this syndrome is characterized by states of increased anxiety, insomnia, and central nervous system excitability that may progress to convulsions. Most sedative-hypnotics-including benzodiazepines-are capable of causing physiologic dependence when used on a long-term basis. However, the severity of withdrawal symptoms differs among individual drugs and depends also on the magnitude of the dose used immediately before cessation of use. When higher doses of sedative-hypnotics are used, abrupt withdrawal leads to more serious withdrawal signs. Differences in the severity of withdrawal symptoms resulting from individual sedative-hypnotics relate in part to half-life, since drugs with long half-lives are eliminated slowly enough to accomplish gradual withdrawal with few physical symptoms. The use of drugs with very short half-lives for hypnotic effects may lead to signs of withdrawal even between doses. For example, triazolam, a benzodiazepine with a half-life of about 4 hours, has been reported to cause daytime anxiety when used to treat sleep disorders. The abrupt cessation of zolpidem, zaleplon, or eszopiclone may also result in withdrawal symptoms, though usually of less intensity than those seen with benzodiazepines.

\section*{BENZODI AZEPI NE ANTAGONI STS: FLUMAZENI L}

Flumazenil is one of several 1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives with a high affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site on the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor that act as competitive antagonists. It blocks many of the actions of benzodiazepines, zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone, but does not antagonize the central nervous system effects of other sedative-hypnotics, ethanol, opioids, or general anesthetics. Flumazenil is approved for use in reversing the central nervous system depressant effects of benzodiazepine overdose and to hasten recovery following use of these drugs in anesthetic and diagnostic procedures. Although the drug reverses the sedative effects of benzodiazepines, antagonism of benzodiazepineinduced respiratory depression is less predictable. When given intravenously, flumazenil acts rapidly but has a short half-life (0.7-1.3 hours) due to rapid hepatic clearance. Because all benzodiazepines have a longer duration of action than flumazenil, sedation commonly recurs, requiring repeated administration of the antagonist.

Adverse effects of flumazenil include agitation, confusion, dizziness, and nausea. Flumazenil may cause a severe precipitated abstinence syndrome in patients who have developed physiologic benzodiazepine dependence. In patients who have ingested benzodiazepines with tricyclic antidepressants, seizures
and cardiac arrhythmias may follow flumazenil administration.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF SEDATI VE-HYPNOTI CS TREATMENT OF ANXI ETY STATES}

The psychologic, behavioral, and physiologic responses that characterize anxiety can take many forms. Typically, the psychic awareness of anxiety is accompanied by enhanced vigilance, motor tension, and autonomic hyperactivity. Anxiety is often secondary to organic disease states-acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, gastrointestinal ulcers, etc-which themselves require specific therapy. Another class of secondary anxiety states (situational anxiety) results from circumstances that may have to be dealt with only once or a few times, including anticipation of frightening medical or dental procedures and family illness or other stressful event. Even though situational anxiety tends to be selflimiting, the short-term use of sedative-hypnotics may be appropriate for the treatment of this and certain disease-associated anxiety states. Similarly, the use of a sedative-hypnotic as premedication prior to surgery or some unpleasant medical procedure is rational and proper (Table 22-2).
\begin{tabular}{|l|}

\hline For insomnia \\
\hline For sedation and amnesia before and during medical and surgical procedures \\

\hline
\end{tabular}

Excessive or unreasonable anxiety about life circumstances (generalized anxiety disorder, GAD), panic disorders, and agoraphobia are also amenable to drug therapy, sometimes in conjunction with psychotherapy. The benzodiazepines continue to be widely used for the management of acute anxiety states and for rapid control of panic attacks. They are also used in the long-term management of GAD and panic disorders. Anxiety symptoms may be relieved by many benzodiazepines, but it is not always easy to demonstrate the superiority of one drug over another. However, alprazolam is particularly effective in the treatment of panic disorders and agoraphobia and appears to be more selective in these conditions than other benzodiazepines. The choice of benzodiazepines for anxiety is based on several sound pharmacologic principles: (1) a relatively high therapeutic index (see drug B in Figure 22-1), plus availability of flumazenil for treatment of overdose; (2) a low risk of drug interactions based on liver enzyme induction; (3) minimal effects on cardiovascular or autonomic functions.

Disadvantages of the benzodiazepines include the risk of dependence, depression of central nervous system functions, and amnestic effects. In addition, the benzodiazepines exert additive central nervous system depression when administered with other drugs, including ethanol. The patient should be warned of this possibility to avoid impairment of performance of any task requiring mental alertness and motor coordination. In the treatment of generalized anxiety disorders and certain phobias, newer antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are now considered by many authorities to be drugs of first choice (see Chapter 30). However, these agents have minimal effectiveness in acute anxiety states.

Sedative-hypnotics should be used with appropriate caution so as to minimize adverse effects. A dose should be prescribed that does not impair mentation or motor functions during waking hours. Some patients may tolerate the drug better if most of the daily dose is given at bedtime, with smaller doses during the day. Prescriptions should be written for short periods, since there is little justification for long-term therapy (defined as use of therapeutic doses for 2 months or longer). The physician should make an effort to assess the efficacy of therapy from the patient's subjective responses. Combinations of antianxiety agents should be avoided, and people taking sedatives should be cautioned about the consumption of alcohol and the concurrent use of over-the-counter medications containing antihistaminic or anticholinergic drugs (see Chapter 64).

\section*{TREATMENT OF SLEEP PROBLEMS}

Sleep disorders are common and often result from inadequate treatment of underlying medical conditions or psychiatric illness. True primary insomnia is rare. Nonpharmacologic therapies that are useful for sleep problems include proper diet and exercise, avoiding stimulants before retiring, ensuring a comfortable sleeping environment, and retiring at a regular time each night. In some cases, however, the patient will need and should be given a sedative-hypnotic for a limited period. It should be noted that the abrupt discontinuance of many drugs in this class can lead to rebound insomnia.

Benzodiazepines can cause a dose-dependent decrease in both REM and slow-wave sleep, though to a lesser extent than the barbiturates. The newer hypnotics zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone are less likely than the benzodiazepines to change sleep patterns. However, so little is known about the clinical impact of these effects that statements about the desirability of a particular drug based on its effects on sleep architecture have more theoretical than practical significance. Clinical criteria of efficacy in alleviating a particular sleeping problem are more useful. The drug selected should be one that provides sleep of fairly rapid onset (decreased sleep latency) and sufficient duration, with minimal "hangover" effects such as drowsiness, dysphoria, and mental or motor depression the following day. Older drugs such as chloral hydrate, secobarbital, and pentobarbital continue to be used, but benzodiazepines, zolpidem, zaleplon, or eszopiclone are generally preferred. Daytime sedation is more common with benzodiazepines that have slow elimination rates (eg, lorazepam) and those that are biotransformed to active metabolites (eg, flurazepam, quazepam). If benzodiazepines are used nightly, tolerance can occur, which may lead to dose increases by the patient to produce the desired effect. Anterograde amnesia occurs to some degree with all benzodiazepines used for hypnosis.

Eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem have efficacies similar to those of the hypnotic benzodiazepines in the management of sleep disorders. Favorable clinical features of zolpidem and the other newer hypnotics include rapid onset of activity and modest day-after psychomotor depression with few
amnestic effects. Zolpidem, currently the most frequently prescribed hypnotic drug in the United States, is available in a biphasic release formulation that provides sustained drug levels for sleep maintenance. Zaleplon acts rapidly, and because of its short half-life, the drug appears to have value in the management of patients who awaken early in the sleep cycle. At recommended doses, zaleplon and eszopiclone (despite its relatively long half-life) appear to cause less amnesia or day-after somnolence than zolpidem or benzodiazepines. The drugs commonly used for sedation and hypnosis are listed in Table 22-3 together with recommended doses. Note: Long-term use of hypnotics is an irrational and dangerous medical practice.

\section*{OTHER THERAPEUTI C USES}

Table 22-2 summarizes several other important clinical uses of drugs in the sedative-hypnotic class. Drugs used in the management of seizure disorders and as intravenous agents in anesthesia are discussed in Chapters 24 and 25.

For sedative and possible amnestic effects during medical or surgical procedures such as endoscopy
and bronchoscopy-as well as for premedication prior to anesthesia-oral formulations of shorter-acting drugs are preferred.

Long-acting drugs such as chlordiazepoxide and diazepam and, to a lesser extent, phenobarbital are administered in progressively decreasing doses to patients during withdrawal from physiologic dependence on ethanol or other sedative-hypnotics. Parenteral lorazepam is used to suppress the symptoms of delirium tremens.

Meprobamate and, more recently, the benzodiazepines have frequently been used as central muscle relaxants, though evidence for general efficacy without accompanying sedation is lacking. A possible exception is diazepam, which has useful relaxant effects in skeletal muscle spasticity of central origin (see Chapter 27).

Psychiatric uses of benzodiazepines other than treatment of anxiety states include the initial management of mania, the control of drug-induced hyperexcitability states (eg, phencyclidine intoxication), and possibly the treatment of major depressive disorders with alprazolam. Sedativehypnotics are also used occasionally as diagnostic aids in neurology and psychiatry.

\section*{CLI NI CAL TOXI COLOGY OF SEDATI VE-HYPNOTI CS}

\section*{Direct Toxic Actions}

Many of the common adverse effects of sedative-hypnotics result from dose-related depression of the central nervous system. Relatively low doses may lead to drowsiness, impaired judgment, and diminished motor skills, sometimes with a significant impact on driving ability, job performance, and personal relationships. Benzodiazepines may cause a significant dose-related anterograde amnesia; they can significantly impair ability to learn new information, particularly that involving effortful cognitive processes, while leaving the retrieval of previously learned information intact. This effect is utilized for uncomfortable clinical procedures, eg, endoscopy, because the patient is able to cooperate during the procedure but amnesic regarding it afterward. The criminal use of benzodiazepines in cases of "date rape" is based on their dose-dependent amnestic effects. Hangover effects are not uncommon following use of hypnotic drugs with long elimination half-lives. Because elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of sedative-hypnotics, doses approximately half of those used in younger adults are safer and usually as effective. The most common reversible cause of confusional states in the elderly is overuse of sedative-hypnotics. At higher doses, toxicity may present as lethargy or a state of exhaustion or, alternatively, as gross symptoms equivalent to those of ethanol intoxication. The physician should be aware of variability among patients in terms of doses causing adverse effects. An increased sensitivity to sedative-hypnotics is more common in patients with cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, or hepatic impairment and in older patients. Sedative-hypnotics can exacerbate breathing problems in patients with chronic pulmonary disease and in those with symptomatic sleep apnea.

Sedative-hypnotics are the drugs most frequently involved in deliberate overdoses, in part because of their general availability as very commonly prescribed pharmacologic agents. The benzodiazepines are considered to be safer drugs in this respect, since they have flatter dose-response curves. Epidemiologic studies on the incidence of drug-related deaths support this general assumption-eg, 0.3 deaths per million tablets of diazepam prescribed versus 11.6 deaths per million capsules of secobarbital in one study. Alprazolam is purportedly more toxic in overdose than other
benzodiazepines. Of course, many factors other than the specific sedative-hypnotic could influence such data-particularly the presence of other central nervous system depressants, including ethanol. In fact, most serious cases of drug overdosage, intentional or accidental, do involve polypharmacy; and when combinations of agents are taken, the practical safety of benzodiazepines may be less than the foregoing would imply.

The lethal dose of any sedative-hypnotic varies with the patient and the circumstances (see Chapter 59). If discovery of the ingestion is made early and a conservative treatment regimen is started, the outcome is rarely fatal, even following very high doses. On the other hand, for most sedative-hypnotics-with the exception of benzodiazepines and possibly the newer hypnotic drugs that have a similar mechanism of action-a dose as low as ten times the hypnotic dose may be fatal if the patient is not discovered or does not seek help in time. With severe toxicity, the respiratory depression from central actions of the drug may be complicated by aspiration of gastric contents in the unattended patient-an even more likely occurrence if ethanol is present. Cardiovascular depression further complicates successful resuscitation. In such patients, treatment consists of ensuring a patent airway, with mechanical ventilation if needed, and maintenance of plasma volume, renal output, and cardiac function. Use of a positive inotropic drug such as dopamine, which preserves renal blood flow, is sometimes indicated. Hemodialysis or hemoperfusion may be used to hasten elimination of some of these drugs.

Flumazenil reverses the sedative actions of benzodiazepines, and probably those of eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem, although experience with its use in overdose of the newer hypnotics is limited. However, its duration of action is short, its antagonism of respiratory depression is unpredictable, and there is a risk of precipitation of withdrawal symptoms in long-term users of benzodiazpines (see below). Consequently, the use of flumazenil in benzodiazepine overdose remains controversial and must be accompanied by adequate monitoring and support of respiratory function. The extensive clinical use of triazolam has led to reports of serious central nervous system effects including behavioral disinhibition, delirium, aggression, and violence. Although behavioral disinhibition may occur with sedative-hypnotic drugs, it does not appear to be more prevalent with triazolam than with other benzodiazepines. Disinhibitory reactions during benzodiazepine treatment are more clearly associated with the use of very high doses and the pretreatment level of patient hostility.

Adverse effects of the sedative-hypnotics that are not referable to their central nervous system actions occur infrequently. Hypersensitivity reactions, including skin rashes, occur only occasionally with most drugs of this class. Reports of teratogenicity leading to fetal deformation following use of piperidinediones and certain benzodiazepines justify caution in the use of these drugs during pregnancy. Because barbiturates enhance porphyrin synthesis, they are absolutely contraindicated in patients with a history of acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, or symptomatic porphyria.

\section*{Alterations in Drug Response}

Depending on the dosage and the duration of use, tolerance occurs in varying degrees to many of the pharmacologic effects of sedative-hypnotics. However, it should not be assumed that the degree of tolerance achieved is identical for all pharmacologic effects. There is evidence that the lethal dose range is not altered significantly by the long-term use of sedative-hypnotics. Cross-tolerance between the different sedative-hypnotics, including ethanol, can lead to an unsatisfactory therapeutic response
when standard doses of a drug are used in a patient with a recent history of excessive use of these agents. However, there have been very few reports of tolerance development when eszopiclone, zolpidem, or zaleplon was used for less than 4 weeks.

With the long-term use of sedative-hypnotics, especially if doses are increased, a state of physiologic dependence can occur. This may develop to a degree unparalleled by any other drug group, including the opioids. Withdrawal from a sedative-hypnotic can have severe and life-threatening manifestations. Withdrawal symptoms range from restlessness, anxiety, weakness, and orthostatic hypotension to hyperactive reflexes and generalized seizures. Symptoms of withdrawal are usually more severe following discontinuance of sedative-hypnotics with shorter half-lives. However, eszopiclone, zolpidem, and zaleplon appear to be exceptions to this, because withdrawal symptoms are minimal following abrupt discontinuance of these newer short-acting agents. Symptoms are less pronounced with longeracting drugs, which may partly accomplish their own "tapered" withdrawal by virtue of their slow elimination. Cross-dependence, defined as the ability of one drug to suppress abstinence symptoms from discontinuance of another drug, is quite marked among sedative-hypnotics. This provides the rationale for therapeutic regimens in the management of withdrawal states: Longer-acting drugs such as chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and phenobarbital can be used to alleviate withdrawal symptoms of shorter-acting drugs, including ethanol.

\section*{Drug I nteractions}

The most common drug interactions involving sedative-hypnotics are interactions with other central nervous system depressant drugs, leading to additive effects. These interactions have some therapeutic usefulness when these drugs are used as adjuvants in anesthesia practice. However, if not anticipated, such interactions can lead to serious consequences, including enhanced depression with concomitant use of many other drugs. Additive effects can be predicted with concomitant use of alcoholic beverages, opioid analgesics, anticonvulsants, and phenothiazines. Less obvious but just as important is enhanced central nervous system depression with a variety of antihistamines, antihypertensive agents, and antidepressant drugs of the tricyclic class.

Interactions involving changes in the activity of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme systems have been discussed (see also Chapter 4 and Appendix II).

\section*{THE ALCOHOLS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Alcohol, primarily in the form of ethyl alcohol (ethanol), has occupied an important place in the history of humankind for at least 8000 years. In Western society, beer and wine were a main staple of daily life until the 19th century. These relatively dilute alcoholic beverages were preferred over water, which was known to be associated with acute and chronic illness. They provided important calories and nutrients and served as a main source of daily liquid intake. As systems for improved sanitation and water purification were introduced in the 1800s, beer and wine became less important components of the human diet, and the consumption of alcoholic beverages, including distilled preparations with higher concentrations of alcohol, shifted toward their present-day role, in many societies, as a socially acceptable form of recreation.

Today, alcohol is widely consumed. Like other sedative-hypnotic drugs, alcohol in low to moderate amounts relieves anxiety and fosters a feeling of well-being or even euphoria. However, alcohol is also the most commonly abused drug in the world, and a cause of vast medical and societal costs. In the United States, approximately 75\% of the adult population drinks alcohol regularly. The majority of this drinking population are able to enjoy the pleasurable effects of alcohol without allowing their alcohol consumption to become a health risk. However, about $10 \%$ of the general population in the United States are unable to limit their ethanol consumption, a condition known as alcohol abuse. People who continue to drink alcohol in spite of adverse medical or social consequences related directly to their alcohol consumption suffer from alcoholism, a complex disorder that appears to have genetic as well as environmental determinants.

The societal and medical costs of alcohol abuse are staggering. It is estimated that about $30 \%$ of all people admitted to hospitals have coexisting alcohol problems. Once in the hospital, people with chronic alcoholism generally have poorer outcomes. In addition, each year thousands of children are born in the USA with morphologic and functional defects resulting from prenatal exposure to ethanol. Despite the investment of many resources and much basic research, alcoholism remains a common chronic disease that is difficult to treat.

Ethanol and many other alcohols with potentially toxic effects are used in industry, some in enormous quantities. In addition to ethanol, methanol and ethylene glycol toxicity occur with sufficient frequency to warrant discussion in this chapter.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF ETHANOL}

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Ethanol is a small water-soluble molecule that is absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract. After ingestion of alcohol in the fasting state, peak blood alcohol concentrations are reached within 30 minutes. The presence of food in the gut delays absorption by slowing gastric emptying. Distribution is rapid, with tissue levels approximating the concentration in blood. The volume of distribution for ethanol approximates total body water ( $0.5-0.7 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{kg}$ ). For an equivalent oral dose of alcohol, women have a higher peak concentration than men, in part because women have a lower total body water
content. In the central nervous system, the concentration of ethanol rises quickly since the brain receives a large proportion of total blood flow and ethanol readily crosses biologic membranes.

Over $90 \%$ of alcohol consumed is oxidized in the liver; much of the remainder is excreted through the lungs and in the urine. The excretion of a small but consistent proportion of alcohol by the lungs is utilized for breath alcohol tests that serve as a basis for a legal definition of "driving under the influence" in many countries. At levels of ethanol usually achieved in blood, the rate of oxidation follows zero-order kinetics; that is, it is independent of time and concentration of the drug. The typical adult can metabolize $7-10 \mathrm{~g}(150-220 \mathrm{mmol})$ of alcohol per hour, the equivalent of approximately one "drink" (10 oz of beer, 3.5 oz of wine, or 1 oz of distilled 80 proof spirits).

Two major pathways of alcohol metabolism to acetaldehyde have been identified (Figure 23-1). Acetaldehyde is then oxidized by a third metabolic process.

Metabolism of ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase and the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS). Alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase are inhibited by fomepizole and disulfiram, respectively.

\section*{ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE PATHWAY}

The primary pathway for alcohol metabolism involves alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde (Figure 23-1, left). This enzyme is located mainly in the liver, but it is also found in other organs such as the brain and stomach. In some Asian populations with polymorphisms in ADH that affect enzyme activity, a form of ADH with reduced activity is associated with an increased risk of alcoholism.

A significant amount of ethanol metabolism by gastric ADH occurs in the stomach in men, but a
smaller amount occurs in women, who appear to have lower levels of the gastric enzyme. This difference in gastric metabolism of alcohol in women probably contributes to the sex-related differences in blood alcohol concentrations noted above.

During conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde, hydrogen ion is transferred from alcohol to the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD ${ }^{+}$) to form NADH. As a net result, alcohol oxidation generates an excess of reducing equivalents in the liver, chiefly as NADH. The excess NADH production appears to contribute to a number of metabolic disorders that accompany chronic alcoholism.

\section*{MI CROSOMAL ETHANOL OXI DIZI NG SYSTEM (MEOS)}

This enzyme system, also known as the mixed function oxidase system, uses NADPH as a cofactor in the metabolism of ethanol (Figure 23-1, right) and consists primarily of cytochrome P450 2E1, 1A2, and 3A4 (see Chapter 4).

At blood concentrations below $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(22 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$, the MEOS system, which has a relatively high $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{m}}$ for alcohol, contributes little to the metabolism of ethanol. However, when large amounts of ethanol are consumed, the alcohol dehydrogenase system becomes saturated owing to depletion of the required cofactor, $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. As the concentration of ethanol increases above $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, there is increased contribution from the MEOS system, which does not rely upon NAD ${ }^{+}$as a cofactor.

During chronic alcohol consumption, MEOS activity is induced. As a result, chronic alcohol consumption results in significant increases not only in ethanol metabolism but also in the clearance of other drugs eliminated by the cytochrome P450s that constitute the MEOS system and the generation of the toxic byproducts of cytochrome P 450 reactions (toxins, free radicals, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ ).

\section*{ACETALDEHYDE METABOLISM}

Much of the acetaldehyde formed from alcohol appears to be oxidized in the liver in a reaction catalyzed by mitochondrial NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). The product of this reaction is acetate (Figure 23-1), which can be further metabolized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and water.

Oxidation of acetaldehyde is inhibited by disulfiram, a drug that has been used to deter drinking by alcohol-dependent patients undergoing treatment. When ethanol is consumed in the presence of disulfiram, acetaldehyde accumulates and causes an unpleasant reaction of facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. Several other drugs (eg, metronidazole, cefotetan, trimethoprim) inhibit ALDH and can cause a disulfiram-like reaction if combined with ethanol.

Some people, primarily of Asian descent, have a genetic deficiency in the activity of the mitochondrial form of ALDH. When these individuals drink alcohol, they develop high blood acetaldehyde concentrations and experience a flushing reaction similar to that seen with the combination of disulfiram and ethanol. Although the presence of the form of ALDH with reduced activity appears to protect against alcoholism, its presence in alcoholics is associated with increased risk of severe liver disease, presumably owing to the toxic effects of aldehyde.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics of Acute Ethanol Consumption}

\section*{CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM}

The central nervous system (CNS) is markedly affected by acute alcohol consumption. Alcohol causes sedation and relief of anxiety and, at higher concentrations, slurred speech, ataxia, impaired judgment, and disinhibited behavior, a condition usually called intoxication or drunkenness (Table

23-1). These CNS effects are most marked as the blood level is rising, because acute tolerance to the effects of alcohol occurs after a few hours of drinking. For chronic drinkers who are tolerant to the effects of alcohol, much higher concentrations are needed to elicit these central nervous system effects. For example, a chronic alcoholic may appear sober or only slightly intoxicated with a blood alcohol concentration of $300-400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, whereas this level is associated with marked intoxication or even coma in a nontolerant individual. The propensity of moderate doses of alcohol to inhibit the attention and information-processing skills as well as the motor skills required for operation of motor vehicles has profound effects. Approximately half of all traffic accidents resulting in a fatality in the United States involve at least one person with blood alcohol near or above the legal level of intoxication, and drunken driving is a leading cause of death in young adults.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Table 23-1. Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) and Clinical Effects in Nontolerant Individuals.} \\
\hline BAC (mg/ dL) ${ }^{1}$ & Clinical Effect \\
\hline 50-100 & Sedation, subjective "high," slower reaction times \\
\hline 100-200 & Impaired motor function, slurred speech, ataxia \\

\hline 300-400 & Coma \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
$1_{\text {In many parts of the USA, a blood level above } 80-100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL} \text { for adults or } 10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL} \text { for persons }}$ under 21 is sufficient for conviction of driving while "under the influence."

Like other sedative-hypnotic drugs, alcohol is a central nervous system depressant. At high blood concentrations, it induces coma, respiratory depression, and death.

Ethanol affects a large number of membrane proteins that participate in signaling pathways, including neurotransmitter receptors for amines, amino acids, and opioids; enzymes such as $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase, adenylyl cyclase, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, and ion channels. Much attention has focused on alcohol's effects on neurotransmission by glutamate and GABA, the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the CNS. Acute ethanol exposure enhances the action of GABA at $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptors, which is consistent with the ability of GABA-mimetics to intensify many of the acute effects of alcohol and of GABA antagonists to attenuate some of the actions of ethanol. Ethanol inhibits the ability of glutamate to open the cation channel associated with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors. The NMDA receptor is implicated in many aspects of cognitive function, including learning and memory. "Blackouts"-periods of memory loss that occur with high levels of alcohol-may result from inhibition of NMDA receptor activation. Experiments that use modern genetic approaches eventually will yield a more precise definition of ethanol's direct and indirect targets. In recent years, experiments with mutant strains of worms and flies have focused
attention on several key genes, including a calcium-regulated and voltage-gated potassium channel that may be one of ethanol's direct targets (see What Can Drunken Worms, Flies, and Mice Tell Us About Alcohol?).

\section*{What Can Drunken Worms, Flies, and Mice Tell Us About Alcohol?}

For a drug like ethanol, which exhibits low potency and specificity and modifies complex behaviors, the identification of direct molecular targets is difficult and has thus far proved elusive. Increasingly, ethanol researchers are employing genetic approaches to complement standard neurobiologic experimentation. Three experimental animal systems for which powerful genetic techniques exist—mice, flies, and worms—have yielded intriguing results.

Strains of mice with abnormal sensitivity to ethanol were identified many years ago by breeding and selection programs. Using sophisticated genetic mapping and sequencing techniques, researchers have made progress in identifying the genes that confer these traits. A more targeted approach is the use of transgenic mice to test hypotheses about specific genes. For example, after earlier experiments suggested a link between brain neuropeptide $Y$ (NPY) and ethanol, researchers used two transgenic mouse models to further investigate the link. They found that a strain of mice that lacks the gene for NPY-NPY knockout mice-consume more ethanol than control mice and are less sensitive to ethanol's sedative effects. As would be expected if increased concentrations of NPY in the brain make mice more sensitive to ethanol, a strain of mice that overexpresses NPY drinks less alcohol than the controls even though their total consumption of food and liquid is normal. Work with other transgenic knockout mice have also implicated the dopamine $D_{2}$ and $D_{4}$ receptors and a subtype of protein kinase C with altered sensitivity to ethanol.

It is easy to imagine mice having measurable behavioral responses to alcohol but drunken worms and fruit flies are harder to imagine. Actually, both invertebrates respond to ethanol in ways that parallel mammalian responses. Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies that are exposed to ethanol vapor show increased locomotion at low concentrations but at higher concentrations, become poorly coordinated, sedated, and finally immobile. The behaviors can be monitored by sophisticated laser or video tracking methods or with an ingenious "chromatography" column that separates relatively insensitive flies from inebriated flies that drop to the bottom of the column. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans similarly exhibits increased locomotion at low ethanol concentrations and, at higher concentrations, reduced locomotion, sedation, and-something that can be turned into an effective screen for mutant worms that are resistant to ethanol-impaired egg laying. The advantage of using flies and worms as genetic models for ethanol research is their relatively simple neuroanatomy, wellestablished techniques for genetic manipulation, an extensive library of well-characterized mutants, and completely or nearly completely solved genetic code. Already, much information has accumulated about candidate proteins involved with the effects of ethanol in flies. In an elegant study on C elegans, researchers found evidence that a calcium-activated, voltage-gated BK potassium channel is a direct target of ethanol. This channel, which is activated by ethanol, has close homologs in flies and vertebrates, and evidence is accumulating that ethanol has similar effects in these homologs. Genetic experiments in these model systems should provide information that will help narrow and focus research into
the complex and important effects of ethanol in humans.

\section*{HEART}

Significant depression of myocardial contractility has been observed in individuals who acutely consume moderate amounts of alcohol, ie, at a blood concentration above $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$.

\section*{SMOOTH MUSCLE}

Ethanol is a vasodilator, probably as a result of both central nervous system effects (depression of the vasomotor center) and direct smooth muscle relaxation caused by its metabolite, acetaldehyde.
In cases of severe overdose, hypothermia-caused by vasodilation-may be marked in cold environments. Ethanol also relaxes the uterus and-before the introduction of more effective and safer uterine relaxants (eg, calcium blockers, magnesium ion, and $B_{2}$-adrenoceptor stimulants)-was used intravenously for the suppression of premature labor.

\section*{Consequences of Chronic Alcohol Consumption}

Chronic alcohol consumption profoundly affects the function of several vital organs-particularly the liver and skeletal muscle-and the nervous, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Since ethanol has low potency, it requires concentrations thousands of times higher than other misused drugs (eg, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines) to produce its intoxicating effects. As a result, ethanol is consumed in quantities that are unusually large for a pharmacologically active drug. The tissue damage caused by chronic alcohol ingestion results from a combination of the direct effects of ethanol and the metabolic consequences of processing a heavy load of a metabolically active substance. Specific mechanisms implicated in tissue damage include increased oxidative stress coupled with depletion of glutathione, damage to mitochondria, growth factor dysregulation, and potentiation of cytokine-induced injury.

Chronic consumption of large amounts of alcohol is associated with an increased risk of death. Deaths linked to alcohol consumption are caused by liver disease, cancer, accidents, and suicide.

\section*{LIVER AND GASTROI NTESTI NAL TRACT}

Liver disease is the most common medical complication of alcohol abuse; an estimated $15-30 \%$ of chronic heavy drinkers eventually develop severe liver disease. Alcoholic fatty liver, a reversible condition, may progress to alcoholic hepatitis and finally to cirrhosis and liver failure. In the USA, chronic alcohol abuse is the leading cause of liver cirrhosis and of the need for liver transplantation. The risk of developing liver disease is related both to the average amount of daily consumption and to the duration of alcohol abuse. Women appear to be more susceptible to alcohol hepatotoxicity than men. Concurrent infection with hepatitis B or C virus increases the risk of severe liver disease.

The pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease is a multifactorial process involving metabolic repercussions of ethanol oxidation in the liver, dysregulation of fatty acid oxidation and synthesis, and activation of the innate immune system by a combination of direct effects of ethanol and its metabolites and by bacterial endotoxins that access the liver as a result of ethanol-induced changes in the intestinal tract. Tumor necrosis factor-a, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is consistently elevated in animal models of alcoholic liver disease and in patients with alcoholic liver disease, appears to play a pivotal role in the progression of alcoholic liver disease and may be a fruitful therapeutic target.

Other portions of the gastrointestinal tract can also be injured. Chronic alcohol ingestion is by far the
most common cause of chronic pancreatitis in the Western world. In addition to its direct toxic effect on pancreatic acinar cells, alcohol alters pancreatic epithelial permeability and promotes the formation of protein plugs and calcium carbonate-containing stones.

Chronic alcoholics are prone to gastritis and have increased susceptibility to blood and plasma protein loss during drinking, which may contribute to anemia and protein malnutrition. Alcohol also reversibly injures the small intestine, leading to diarrhea, weight loss, and multiple vitamin deficiencies.

Malnutrition from dietary deficiency and vitamin deficiencies due to malabsorption are common in alcoholic individuals. Malabsorption of water-soluble vitamins is especially severe.

\section*{NERVOUS SYSTEM}

\section*{Tolerance and Physical Dependence}

The consumption of alcohol in high doses over a long period results in tolerance and in physical and psychologic dependence. Tolerance to the intoxicating effects of alcohol is a complex process involving poorly understood changes in the nervous system as well as the metabolic changes described earlier. As with other sedative-hypnotic drugs, there is a limit to tolerance, so that only a relatively small increase in the lethal dose occurs with increasing alcohol use.

Chronic alcohol drinkers, when forced to reduce or discontinue alcohol, experience a withdrawal syndrome, which indicates the existence of physical dependence. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms classically consist of hyperexcitability in mild cases and seizures, toxic psychosis, and delirium tremens in severe ones. The dose, rate, and duration of alcohol consumption determine the intensity of the withdrawal syndrome. When consumption has been very high, merely reducing the rate of consumption may lead to signs of withdrawal.

Psychologic dependence upon alcohol is characterized by a compulsive desire to experience the rewarding effects of alcohol and, for current drinkers, a desire to avoid the negative consequences of withdrawal. People who have recovered from alcoholism and become abstinent still experience periods of intense craving for alcohol that can be set off by environmental cues associated in the past with drinking, such as familiar places, groups of people, or events.

The molecular basis of alcohol tolerance and dependence is not known, nor is it known if the two phenomena reflect opposing effects upon a shared molecular pathway. Tolerance may result from ethanol-induced up-regulation of a pathway in response to the continuous presence of ethanol. Dependence may result from overactivity of that same pathway after the ethanol effect dissipates and before the system has time to return to a normal ethanol-free state. Chronic exposure of animals or cultured cells to alcohol elicits a multitude of adaptive responses involving neurotransmitters and their receptors, ion channels, and enzymes that participate in signal transduction pathways. Upregulation of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors and voltage-sensitive $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels may underlie the seizures that accompany the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Based on the ability of sedative-hypnotic drugs that enhance GABAergic neurotransmission to substitute for alcohol during alcohol withdrawal and evidence of down-regulation of $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$-mediated responses with chronic alcohol exposure, changes in GABA neurotransmission are believed to play a central role in tolerance and withdrawal.

Neurotransmission events involved in the sensation of reward are also important. Alcohol affects local concentrations of serotonin, opioids, and dopamine-neurotransmitters involved in brain reward
circuits (see Chapter 32). Alcohol also has complex effects on the expression of receptors for these neurotransmitters and their signaling pathways. The discovery that naltrexone, a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist, helps patients who are recovering from alcoholism abstain from drinking supports the idea that a common neurochemical reward system is shared by very different drugs associated with physical and psychological dependence.

\section*{Neurotoxicity}

Consumption of large amounts of alcohol over extended periods (usually years) often leads to neurologic deficits. The most common neurologic abnormality in chronic alcoholism is generalized symmetric peripheral nerve injury, which begins with distal paresthesias of the hands and feet. Chronic alcoholics may also exhibit gait disturbances and ataxia that are due to degenerative changes in the central nervous system. Other neurologic disturbances associated with alcoholism include dementia and, rarely, demyelinating disease.

Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a relatively uncommon but important entity characterized by paralysis of the external eye muscles, ataxia, and a confused state that can progress to coma and death. It is associated with thiamin deficiency but is rarely seen in the absence of alcoholism. Because of the importance of thiamin in this pathologic condition and the absence of toxicity associated with thiamine administration, all patients suspected of having Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (including virtually all patients who present to the emergency department with altered consciousness, seizures, or both) should receive thiamine therapy. Often, the ocular signs, ataxia, and confusion improve promptly upon administration of thiamine. However, most patients are left with a chronic disabling memory disorder known as Korsakoff's psychosis.

Alcohol may also impair visual acuity, with painless blurring that occurs over several weeks of heavy alcohol consumption. Changes are usually bilateral and symmetric and may be followed by optic nerve degeneration. Ingestion of ethanol substitutes such as methanol (see Pharmacology of Other Alcohols) causes severe visual disturbances.

\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM}

\section*{Cardiomyopathy and Heart Failure}

Alcohol has complex effects on the cardiovascular system. Heavy alcohol consumption of long duration is associated with a dilated cardiomyopathy with ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis. In animals and humans, alcohol induces a number of changes in heart cells that may contribute to cardiomyopathy. They include membrane disruption, depressed function of mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum, intracellular accumulation of phospholipids and fatty acids, and up-regulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels. There is evidence that patients with alcohol-induced dilated cardiomyopathy do significantly worse than patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, even though cessation of drinking is associated with a reduction in cardiac size and improved function. The poorer prognosis for patients who continue to drink appears to be due in part to interference by ethanol with the beneficial effects of Bblockers and ACE inhibitors.

\section*{Arrhythmias}

Heavy drinking-and especially "binge" drinking-are associated with both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal syndrome can develop severe arrhythmias that may reflect abnormalities of potassium or magnesium metabolism as well as enhanced release of catecholamines. Seizures, syncope, and sudden death during alcohol withdrawal may be due to these
arrhythmias.

\section*{Hypertension}

A link between heavier alcohol consumption (more than three drinks per day) and hypertension has been firmly established in epidemiologic studies. Alcohol is estimated to be responsible for approximately $5 \%$ of cases of hypertension, making it one of the most common causes of reversible hypertension. This association is independent of obesity, salt intake, coffee drinking, and cigarette smoking. A reduction in alcohol intake appears to be effective in lowering blood pressure in hypertensives who are also heavy drinkers; the hypertension seen in this population is also responsive to standard blood pressure medications.

\section*{Coronary Heart Disease}

Although the deleterious effects of excessive alcohol use on the cardiovascular system are well established, there is controversy over the effects of moderate drinking (one to three drinks per day) on the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD). A number of observational studies concluded that moderate alcohol consumption actually prevents CHD and even reduces mortality. This type of relationship between mortality and the dose of a drug is called a "J-shaped" relationship. Results of these clinical studies are supported by ethanol's ability to raise serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the form of cholesterol that appears to protect against atherosclerosis; see Chapter 35), its ability to inhibit some of the inflammatory processes that underlie atherosclerosis, and the presence in alcoholic beverages (especially red wine) of antioxidants and other substances that may protect against atherosclerosis. More recently, the relationship between moderate drinking and CHD has been called into question based on further investigation of confounders that affected the outcome of earlier epidemiologic studies. For example, moderate drinkers, especially wine drinkers, come from a higher socioeconomic level and may have healthier dietary habits; consumption tends to decrease with age; abstinence often is associated with ill health; and documenting precise amounts of consumption is difficult. Therefore, definitive conclusions regarding a cardioprotective effect of alcohol must await better clinical evidence.

\section*{BLOOD}

Alcohol indirectly affects hematopoiesis through metabolic and nutritional effects and may also directly inhibit the proliferation of all cellular elements in bone marrow. The most common hematologic disorder seen in chronic drinkers is mild anemia resulting from alcohol-related folic acid deficiency. Iron deficiency anemia may result from gastrointestinal bleeding. Alcohol has also been implicated as a cause of several hemolytic syndromes, some of which are associated with hyperlipidemia and severe liver disease.

\section*{ENDOCRINE SYSTEM AND ELECTROLYTE BALANCE}

Chronic alcohol use has important effects on the endocrine system and on fluid and electrolyte balance. Clinical reports of gynecomastia and testicular atrophy in alcoholics with or without cirrhosis suggest a derangement in steroid hormone balance.

Alcoholics with chronic liver disease may have disorders of fluid and electrolyte balance, including ascites, edema, and effusions. Alterations of whole body potassium induced by vomiting and diarrhea, as well as severe secondary aldosteronism, may contribute to muscle weakness and can be worsened by diuretic therapy. Some alcoholic patients develop hypoglycemia, probably as a result of impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis. Some alcoholics also develop ketosis, caused by excessive lipolytic
factors, especially increased cortisol and growth hormone.

\section*{FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME}

Chronic maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy is associated with teratogenic effects, and alcohol appears to be a leading cause of mental retardation and congenital malformation. The abnormalities that have been characterized as fetal alcohol syndrome include (1) intrauterine growth retardation, (2) microcephaly, (3) poor coordination, (4) underdevelopment of midfacial region (appearing as a flattened face), and (5) minor joint anomalies. More severe cases may include congenital heart defects and mental retardation. While the level of alcohol intake required for causing serious neurologic deficits appears quite high, the threshold for causing more subtle neurologic deficits is uncertain.

The mechanisms that underlie ethanol's teratogenic effects are unknown. Ethanol rapidly crosses the placenta and reaches concentrations in the fetus that are similar to those in maternal blood. The fetal liver has little or no alcohol dehydrogenase activity, so the fetus must rely on maternal and placental enzymes for elimination of alcohol.

The neuropathologic abnormalities seen in humans and in animal models of fetal alcohol syndrome indicate that ethanol triggers apoptotic neurodegeneration and also causes aberrant neuronal and glial migration in the developing nervous system. In tissue culture systems, ethanol causes a striking reduction in neurite outgrowth.

\section*{I MMUNE SYSTEM}

The effects of alcohol on the immune system are complex; immune function in some tissues is inhibited (eg, the lung), whereas pathologic, hyperactive immune function in other tissues is triggered (eg, liver, pancreas). In addition, acute and chronic exposure to alcohol have widely different effects on immune function. The types of immunologic changes reported for the lung include suppression of the function of alveolar macrophages, inhibition of chemotaxis of granulocytes, and reduced number and function of T cells. In the liver, there is enhanced function of key cells of the innate immune system (eg, Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells) and increased cytokine production. In addition to the inflammatory damage that chronic heavy alcohol use precipitates in the liver and pancreas, it predisposes to the development of infections, especially of the lung, and worsens the morbidity and increases the mortality risk of patients with pneumonia.

\section*{I NCREASED RISK OF CANCER}

Chronic alcohol use increases the risk for cancer of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, and liver. Evidence also points to a small increase in the risk of breast cancer in women. Much more information is required before a threshold level for alcohol consumption as it relates to cancer can be established. Alcohol itself does not appear to be a carcinogen in most test systems. However, its primary metabolite, acetaldehyde, can damage DNA, as can the reactive oxygen species produced by increased cytochrome P450 activity. Other factors implicated in the link between alcohol and cancer include changes in folate metabolism and the growth-promoting effects of chronic inflammation.

\section*{Alcohol-Drug I nteractions}

Interactions between ethanol and other drugs can have important clinical effects that result from alterations in the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the second drug.

The most frequent pharmacokinetic alcohol-drug interactions occur as a result of alcohol-induced
increases of drug-metabolizing enzymes, as described in Chapter 4. Thus, prolonged intake of alcohol without damage to the liver may enhance the metabolic biotransformation of other drugs. Ethanolmediated induction of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes is particularly important with regard to acetaminophen. Chronic consumption at the level of three or more drinks per day increases the risk of hepatotoxicity due to toxic or even high therapeutic levels of acetaminophen. This is probably due to increased P450-mediated conversion of acetaminophen to reactive hepatotoxic metabolites (see Figure 4-4). In 1998, the FDA announced that all OTC products containing acetaminophen must carry a warning about the relationship between chronic ethanol consumption and acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity.

In contrast, acute alcohol use may inhibit metabolism of other drugs. This inhibition may be due to decreased enzyme activity or decreased liver blood flow. Phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and sedative-hypnotic drugs are the most important drugs that may interact with alcohol by this pharmacokinetic mechanism.

Pharmacodynamic alcohol interactions are also of great clinical significance. Additive central nervous system depression with other central nervous system depressants, particularly sedative-hypnotics, is most important. Alcohol also potentiates the pharmacologic effects of many nonsedative drugs, including vasodilators and oral hypoglycemic agents.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF ETHANOL}

Ethanol is the cause of more preventable morbidity and mortality than all other drugs combined with the exception of tobacco. The search for specific etiologic factors or the identification of significant predisposing variables for alcohol abuse has generally led to disappointing results. Personality type, severe life stresses, psychiatric disorders, and parental role models are not reliable predictors of alcohol abuse. Although environmental factors clearly play a role, evidence suggests that there is a large genetic contribution to the development of alcoholism. Not surprisingly, polymorphisms in alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase that lead to increased aldehyde accumulation (and therefore more severe hangover symptoms) appear to protect against alcoholism. Much attention in genetic mapping experiments has focused on membrane-signaling proteins known to be affected by ethanol and on protein constituents of reward pathways in the brain. Early reports of an association of an allele of the dopamine $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ receptor with alcohol dependence have not been confirmed. Other candidate genes for susceptibility to alcoholism identified in genome-wide screens in humans include the dopamine $D_{4}$ receptor, the $B_{1}$ subunit of the $G A B A_{A}$ receptor, and tyrosine hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine (see Chapter 6).

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ALCOHOL I NTOXI CATION}

Nontolerant individuals who consume alcohol in large quantities develop typical effects of acute sedative-hypnotic drug overdose along with the cardiovascular effects described above (vasodilation, tachycardia) and gastrointestinal irritation. Since tolerance is not absolute, even chronic alcoholics may become severely intoxicated if sufficient alcohol is consumed.

The most important goals in the treatment of acute alcohol intoxication are to prevent severe respiratory depression and to prevent aspiration of vomitus. Even with very high blood ethanol levels,
survival is probable as long as the respiratory and cardiovascular systems can be supported. The average blood alcohol concentration in fatal cases is above $400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$; however, the lethal dose of alcohol varies because of varying degrees of tolerance.

Metabolic alterations may require treatment of hypoglycemia and ketosis by administration of glucose. Thiamine is given to protect against the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Alcoholic patients who are dehydrated and vomiting should also receive electrolyte solutions. If vomiting is severe, large amounts of potassium may be required as long as renal function is normal. Especially important is recognition of decreased serum concentrations of phosphate, which may be aggravated by glucose administration.

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME}

Abrupt alcohol withdrawal leads to a characteristic syndrome of motor agitation, anxiety, insomnia, and reduction of seizure threshold. The severity of the syndrome is usually proportionate to the degree and duration of alcohol abuse. However, this can be greatly modified by the use of other sedatives as well as by associated factors (eg, diabetes, injury). In its mildest form, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome of tremor, anxiety, and insomnia occurs $6-8$ hours after alcohol consumption is stopped. These effects usually abate in 1-2 days. In some patients, more severe withdrawal reactions occur in which visual hallucinations, total disorientation, and marked abnormalities of vital signs occur. Alcohol withdrawal is one of the most common causes of seizures in adults.

The major objective of drug therapy in the alcohol withdrawal period is prevention of seizures, delirium, and arrhythmias. Potassium, magnesium, and phosphate balance should be restored as rapidly as is consistent with renal function. Thiamine therapy is initiated in all cases. Persons in mild alcohol withdrawal do not need any other pharmacologic assistance.

Specific drug treatment for detoxification in severe cases involves two basic principles: substituting a long-acting sedative-hypnotic drug for alcohol and then gradually reducing ("tapering") the dose of the long-acting drug. Because of their wide margin of safety, benzodiazepines are preferred, though barbiturates such as phenobarbital were used in the past. Since any benzodiazepine will prevent symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, the choice of a specific agent in this class is generally based on pharmacokinetic or economic considerations. Long-acting benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide, clorazepate, and diazepam, have the advantage of requiring less frequent dosing. Since their pharmacologically active metabolites are eliminated slowly, the long-acting drugs provide a built-in tapering effect. A disadvantage of the long-acting drugs is that they and their pharmacologically active metabolites may accumulate, especially in patients with compromised liver function. Short-acting drugs such as lorazepam and oxazepam are rapidly converted to inactive water-soluble metabolites that will not accumulate, and for this reason the short-acting drugs are especially useful in alcoholic patients with liver disease. Benzodiazepines can be administered orally in mild or moderate cases, or parenterally for patients with more severe withdrawal reactions.

After the alcohol withdrawal syndrome has been treated acutely, sedative-hypnotic medications must be tapered slowly over several weeks. Complete detoxification is not achieved with just a few days of alcohol abstinence. Several months may be required for restoration of normal nervous system function, especially sleep.

\section*{TREATMENT OF ALCOHOLISM}

Following detoxification, psychosocial therapy either in intensive inpatient or in outpatient rehabilitation programs serves as the primary treatment for alcohol dependence. Other psychiatric problems, most commonly depressive or anxiety disorders, often coexist with alcoholism and, if untreated, can contribute to the tendency of detoxified alcoholics to relapse. Treatment of these associated disorders with counseling and drugs can help decrease the rate of relapse for alcoholic patients.

Three drugs-disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate-have FDA approval for adjunctive treatment of alcohol dependence.

\section*{Naltrexone}

Naltrexone is an orally active opioid receptor antagonist that blocks the effects at $\mu$ opioid receptors of exogenous and endogenous opioids (see Chapter 31). Studies in experimental animals first suggested a link between alcohol consumption and opioids. Injection of small amounts of opioids was followed by an increase in alcohol drinking, whereas administration of opioid antagonists inhibited self-administration of alcohol.

Naltrexone, a relatively long-acting oral opioid antagonist, has been shown in a number of short-term (12-week) placebo-controlled trials to reduce craving for alcohol and to reduce the rate of relapse to either drinking or alcohol dependence. Longer trials (6-12 months) have failed to show evidence to support long-term treatment. Naltrexone was approved in 1994 by the FDA for treatment of alcohol dependence.

Naltrexone is taken once a day in a dose of 50 mg for treatment of alcoholism. The drug should be used with caution in alcoholic patients with evidence of mild abnormalities in serum aminotransferase activity. The combination of naltrexone plus disulfiram should be avoided since both drugs are potential hepatotoxins. Administration of naltrexone to patients who are physically dependent on opioids will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome, so patients must be opioid-free before initiating naltrexone therapy. Naltrexone also blocks the therapeutic effects of usual doses of opioids.

\section*{Acamprosate}

Acamprosate has been used in Europe for a number of years to treat alcohol dependence and was approved for this use by the FDA in 2004. Like ethanol itself, acamprosate has many molecular effects including effects on GABA, glutamate, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic effects. Probably its best characterized actions are as a weak NMDA-receptor antagonist and a GABA ${ }_{A^{-}}$ receptor activator. In clinical trials, acamprosate reduces short-term and long-term (more than 6 months) relapse rates when combined with psychotherapy.

Acamprosate is administered as 1-2 enteric-coated 333-mg tablets three times per day. It is poorly absorbed, and food reduces its absorption even further. Acamprosate is widely distributed and is eliminated renally. It does not participate in drug-drug interactions. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and rash. It is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment.

\section*{Disulfiram}

Disulfiram causes extreme discomfort in patients who drink alcoholic beverages. Disulfiram given by itself to nondrinkers has little effect; however, flushing, throbbing headache, nausea, vomiting,
sweating, hypotension, and confusion occur within a few minutes after drinking alcohol. The effect may last 30 minutes in mild cases or several hours in severe ones. Disulfiram acts by inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase. Thus, alcohol is metabolized as usual, but acetaldehyde accumulates.

Disulfiram is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; however, a period of 12 hours is required for its full action. Its elimination rate is slow, so that its action may persist for several days after the last dose. The drug inhibits the metabolism of many other therapeutic agents, including phenytoin, oral anticoagulants, and isoniazid. It should not be administered with medications that contain alcohol, including nonprescription medications such as those listed in Table 64-3. Disulfiram can cause small increases in liver function tests. Its safety in pregnancy has not been demonstrated.

Because compliance with disulfiram therapy is low and because the evidence from clinical trials for its effectiveness is weak, disulfiram is no longer commonly used.

\section*{Other Drugs}

There is some evidence that topiramate, a drug used for partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (Chapter 24), and ondansetron, a serotonin 5-HT3-receptor antagonist (Chapters 16, 63), are effective in reducing craving in chronic alcoholics.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGY OF OTHER ALCOHOLS}

Other alcohols related to ethanol have wide applications as industrial solvents and occasionally cause severe poisoning. Of these, methanol and ethylene glycol are two of the most common causes of intoxication.

\section*{Methanol}

Methanol (methyl alcohol, wood alcohol) is widely used in the industrial production of synthetic organic compounds and as a constituent of many commercial solvents. In the home, methanol is most frequently found in the form of "canned heat" or in windshield-washing products. Poisonings occur from accidental ingestion of methanol-containing products or when it is used by alcoholics as an ethanol substitute.

Methanol can be absorbed through the skin or from the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract and is then distributed in body water. The primary mechanism of elimination of methanol in humans is by oxidation to formaldehyde, formic acid, and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ :
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-0688.jpg?height=225&width=1029&top_left_y=1858&top_left_x=239)

Animal species show great variability in mean lethal doses of methanol. The special susceptibility of humans to methanol toxicity is probably due to folate-dependent production of formate and not to methanol itself or to formaldehyde, the intermediate metabolite.

The most characteristic symptom in methanol poisoning is a visual disturbance, frequently described
as "like being in a snowstorm." A complaint of blurred vision with a relatively clear sensorium should strongly suggest the diagnosis of methanol poisoning. Since much of the toxicity is due to metabolites of methanol, there is often a delay of up to 30 hours before development of visual disturbances and other signs of severe intoxication.

Physical findings in methanol poisoning are generally nonspecific. In severe cases, the odor of formaldehyde may be present on the breath or in the urine. Changes in the retina may sometimes be detected on examination, but these are usually late. The development of bradycardia, prolonged coma, seizures, and resistant acidosis all imply a poor prognosis. The cause of death in fatal cases is sudden cessation of respiration.

It is critical that the blood methanol level be determined as soon as possible if the diagnosis is suspected. Methanol concentrations higher than $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ are thought to be an absolute indication for hemodialysis and ethanol treatment, though formate blood levels are a better indication of clinical pathology. Additional laboratory evidence includes metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap and osmolar gap (see Chapter 59). A decrease in serum bicarbonate is a uniform feature of severe methanol poisoning.

The first treatment for methanol poisoning, as in all critical poisoning situations, is support of respiration.There are three specific modalities of treatment for severe methanol poisoning: suppression of metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase to toxic products, hemodialysis to enhance removal of methanol and its toxic products, and alkalinization to counteract metabolic acidosis.

The enzyme chiefly responsible for methanol oxidation in the liver is alcohol dehydrogenase. Ethanol has a higher affinity than methanol for alcohol dehydrogenase; thus, saturation of the enzyme with ethanol reduces formate production. Ethanol is often used intravenously as treatment for methanol poisoning. The dose-dependent characteristics of ethanol metabolism and the variability of ethanol metabolism require frequent monitoring of blood ethanol levels to ensure appropriate alcohol concentration. Fomepizole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning (see next section) and methanol poisoning.

Hemodialysis rapidly eliminates both methanol and formate. However, ethanol is also eliminated in the dialysate, requiring alterations in the dose of ethanol. Hemodialysis is discussed in Chapter 59.

Two other measures are commonly taken. Because of profound metabolic acidosis in methanol poisoning, treatment with bicarbonate often is necessary. Since folate-dependent systems are responsible for the oxidation of formic acid to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in humans, it is probably useful to administer folic acid to patients poisoned with methanol, though this has never been fully tested in clinical studies.

\section*{Ethylene Glycol}

Polyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol ( $\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{OHCH}_{2} \mathrm{OH}$ ) are used as heat exchangers, in antifreeze formulations, and as industrial solvents. Young children and animals are sometimes attracted by the sweet taste of ethylene glycol and, rarely, it is ingested intentionally as an ethanol substitute or in attempted suicide. While ethylene glycol itself is relatively harmless and eliminated by the kidney, it is metabolized to toxic aldehydes and oxalate.

Three stages of ethylene glycol overdose occur. Within the first few hours after ingestion, there is transient excitation followed by central nervous system depression. After a delay of 4-12 hours,
severe metabolic acidosis develops from accumulation of acid metabolites and lactate. Finally, delayed renal insufficiency follows deposition of oxalate in renal tubules. The key to the diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning is recognition of anion gap acidosis, osmolar gap, and oxalate crystals in the urine in a patient without visual symptoms.

As with methanol poisoning, early ethanol infusion and hemodialysis are standard treatments for ethylene glycol poisoning. Fomepizole, an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, has FDA approval for treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning in adults based on its ability to decrease concentrations of toxic metabolites in blood and urine and to prevent renal injury. Intravenous treatment with fomepizole is initiated immediately and continued until the patient's serum ethylene glycol concentration drops below a toxic threshold ( $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). Adverse effects associated with fomepizole are not severe. Headache, nausea, and dizziness are most frequently reported, and a few patients experience minor allergic reactions. Fomepizole is classified as an orphan drug (see Chapter 5) because ethylene glycol poisoning is relatively uncommon. Its cost—estimated to be $\$ 4000$ per patient-is much higher than the cost of infusible ethanol, but fomepizole offers some advantages over ethanol as an antidote for this potentially fatal poisoning.

\section*{ANTI SEI ZURE DRUGS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Approximately $1 \%$ of the world's population has epilepsy, the second most common neurologic disorder after stroke. Although standard therapy permits control of seizures in $80 \%$ of these patients, millions (500,000 people in the USA alone) have uncontrolled epilepsy. Epilepsy is a heterogeneous symptom complex-a chronic disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Seizures are finite episodes of brain dysfunction resulting from abnormal discharge of cerebral neurons. The causes of seizures are many and include the full range of neurologic diseases—from infection to neoplasm and head injury. In some subgroups, heredity has proved to be a predominant factor.

The antiseizure drugs described in this chapter are also used in patients with febrile seizures or with seizures occurring as part of an acute illness such as meningitis. The term "epilepsy" is not usually applied to such patients unless chronic seizures develop later. Seizures are occasionally caused by an acute underlying toxic or metabolic disorder, in which case appropriate therapy should be directed toward the specific abnormality, eg, hypocalcemia. In most cases of epilepsy, however, the choice of medication depends on the empiric seizure classification.

\section*{Drug Development for Epilepsy}

For a long time it was assumed that a single drug could be developed for the treatment of all forms of epilepsy, but the causes of epilepsy are extremely diverse, encompassing genetic and developmental defects and infective, traumatic, neoplastic, and degenerative disease processes. Drug therapy to date shows little evidence of etiologic specificity. There is, however, some specificity according to seizure type (Table 24-1). This is most clearly seen with generalized seizures of the absence type. These are typically seen with $2-3 \mathrm{~Hz}$ spike-and-wave discharges on the electroencephalogram, which respond to ethosuximide and valproate but can be exacerbated by phenytoin and carbamazepine. Drugs acting selectively on absence seizures can be identified by animal screens, using either threshold pentylenetetrazol clonic seizures in mice or rats or mutant mice showing absence-like episodes (socalled lethargic, star-gazer, or tottering mutants). In contrast, the maximal electroshock (MES) test, with suppression of the tonic extensor phase, identifies drugs such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine that are active against generalized tonic-clonic seizures and complex partial seizures. Use of the maximal electroshock test as the major initial screen for new drugs has probably led to the identification of drugs with a common mechanism of action involving prolonged inactivation of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel. Limbic seizures induced in rats by the process of electrical kindling (involving repeated episodes of focal electrical stimulation) probably provide a better screen for predicting efficacy in complex partial seizures.

\end{tabular}
${ }^{1}$ An epileptic syndrome rather than a specific seizure type; drugs useful in infantile spasms will be reviewed separately.

Existing antiseizure drugs provide adequate seizure control in about two thirds of patients. A fraction of the epileptic population is resistant to all available drugs, and this may be due to increased expression of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein 170, a product of the ABCB1 gene. In children, some severe seizure syndromes associated with progressive brain damage are very difficult to treat. In adults, some focal seizures are refractory to medications. Some, particularly in the temporal lobe, are amenable to surgical resection. Some of the drug-resistant population may respond to vagus-nerve stimulation (VNS), a nonpharmacologic treatment for epilepsy now widely approved for treatment of patients with partial seizures. VNS is indicated for refractory cases or for patients in whom antiseizure drugs are poorly tolerated. Stimulating electrodes are implanted in the left vagus nerve, and the pacemaker is implanted in the chest wall or axilla. Use of this device may permit seizure control with lower doses of drugs.

New antiseizure drugs are being sought not only by the screening tests noted above but also by more rational approaches. Compounds are sought that act by one of three mechanisms: (1) enhancement of GABAergic (inhibitory) transmission, (2) diminution of excitatory (usually glutamatergic) transmission, or (3) modification of ionic conductances.

\section*{BASIC PHARMACOLOGY OF ANTI SEI ZURE DRUGS}

\section*{Chemistry}

Until 1990, approximately 16 antiseizure drugs were available, and 13 of them can be classified into five very similar chemical groups: barbiturates, hydantoins, oxazolidinediones, succinimides, and acetylureas. These groups have in common a similar heterocyclic ring structure with a variety of substituents (Figure 24-1). For drugs with this basic structure, the substituents on the heterocyclic ring determine the pharmacologic class, either anti-MES or antipentylenetetrazol. Very small changes in structure can dramatically alter the mechanism of action and clinical properties of the compound. The remaining drugs-carbamazepine, valproic acid, and the benzodiazepines-are structurally dissimilar, as are the newer compounds marketed since 1990, ie, felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, pregabalin, tiagabine, topiramate, vigabatrin, and zonisamide.

Antiseizure heterocyclic ring structure. The "X" varies as follows: hydantoin derivatives, - N-; barbiturates, - C - N -; oxazolidinediones, $-\mathrm{O}-$; succinimides, $-\mathrm{C}-$; acetylureas, $-\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ ( N connected to $\mathrm{C}_{2}$ ). $\mathrm{R}_{1}, \mathrm{R}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{R}_{3}$ vary within each subgroup.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

The antiseizure drugs exhibit many similar pharmacokinetic properties-even those whose structural and chemical properties are quite diverse-because most have been selected for oral activity and all must enter the central nervous system. Although many of these compounds are only slightly soluble, absorption is usually good, with 80-100\% of the dose reaching the circulation. Most antiseizure drugs are not highly bound to plasma proteins.

Antiseizure drugs are cleared chiefly by hepatic mechanisms, although they have low extraction ratios (see Chapter 3). Many are converted to active metabolites that are also cleared by the liver. These drugs are predominantly distributed into total body water. Plasma clearance is relatively slow; many anticonvulsants are therefore considered to be medium- to long-acting. Some have half-lives longer than 12 hours. Many of the older antiseizure drugs are potent inducers of hepatic microsomal enzyme activity.

\section*{Drugs Used in Partial Seizures \& Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures}

The classic major drugs for partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures are phenytoin (and congeners), carbamazepine, valproate, and the barbiturates. However, the availability of newer drugs-lamotrigine, levetiracetam, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, pregabalin, topiramate, vigabatrin, and zonisamide is altering clinical practice in countries where these compounds are available.

\section*{PHENYTOI N}

Phenytoin is the oldest nonsedative antiseizure drug, introduced in 1938, after a systematic evaluation of compounds such as phenobarbital that altered electrically induced seizures in laboratory animals. It was known for decades as diphenylhydantoin.

\section*{Chemistry}

Phenytoin is a diphenyl-substituted hydantoin with the structure shown below. It has much lower sedative properties than compounds with alkyl substituents at the 5 position. A more soluble prodrug of phenytoin, fosphenytoin, is available for parenteral use; this phosphate ester compound is rapidly converted to phenytoin in the plasma.

Phenytoin

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Phenytoin has major effects on several physiologic systems. It alters $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ conductance, membrane potentials, and the concentrations of amino acids and the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Studies with neurons in cell culture show that phenytoin blocks sustained high-frequency repetitive firing of action potentials (Figure 24-2). This effect is seen at therapeutically relevant concentrations. It is a use-dependent effect (see Chapter 14) on $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$conductance, arising from preferential binding to-and prolongation of-the inactivated state of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel. This effect is also seen with therapeutically relevant concentrations of carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and valproate and probably contributes to their antiseizure action in the electroshock model and in partial seizures.

Figure 24-2.

Effects of three antiseizure drugs on sustained high-frequency firing of action potentials by cultured neurons. Intracellular recordings were made from neurons while depolarizing current pulses, approximately 0.75 s in duration, were applied (on-off step changes indicated by arrows). In the absence of drug, a series of highfrequency repetitive action potentials filled the entire duration of the current pulse. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and sodium valproate all markedly reduced the number of action potentials elicited by the current pulses. (Modified and reproduced, with permission, from Macdonald RL, Meldrum BS: Principles of antiepileptic drug action. In: Levy RH, et al [editors]: Antiepileptic Drugs, 4th ed. Raven Press, 1995.)

In addition, phenytoin paradoxically causes excitation in some cerebral neurons. A reduction of calcium permeability, with inhibition of calcium influx across the cell membrane, may explain the ability of phenytoin to inhibit a variety of calcium-induced secretory processes, including release of hormones and neurotransmitters. Recording of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials show that phenytoin decreases the synaptic release of glutamate and enhances the release of GABA. The mechanism of phenytoin's action probably involves a combination of actions at several levels. At therapeutic concentrations, the major action of phenytoin is to block sodium channels and inhibit the generation of rapidly repetitive action potentials. Presynaptic actions on glutamate and GABA release probably arise from actions other than those on voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels.

\section*{Clinical Use}

Phenytoin is effective against partial seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. In the latter, it appears to be effective against attacks that are either primary or secondary to another seizure type.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Absorption of phenytoin is highly dependent on the formulation of the dosage form. Particle size and pharmaceutical additives affect both the rate and the extent of absorption. Absorption of phenytoin sodium from the gastrointestinal tract is nearly complete in most patients, although the time to peak may range from 3 hours to 12 hours. Absorption after intramuscular injection is unpredictable, and some drug precipitation in the muscle occurs; this route of administration is not recommended for phenytoin. In contrast, fosphenytoin, a more soluble phosphate prodrug of phenytoin, is well absorbed after intramuscular administration.

Phenytoin is highly bound to plasma proteins. The total plasma level decreases when the percentage that is bound decreases, as in uremia or hypoalbuminemia, but correlation of free levels with clinical
states remains uncertain. Drug concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is proportionate to the free plasma level. Phenytoin accumulates in brain, liver, muscle, and fat.

Phenytoin is metabolized to inactive metabolites that are excreted in the urine. Only a very small proportion of phenytoin is excreted unchanged.

The elimination of phenytoin is dose-dependent. At very low blood levels, phenytoin metabolism follows first-order kinetics. However, as blood levels rise within the therapeutic range, the maximum capacity of the liver to metabolize phenytoin is approached (Figure 24-3). Further increases in dosage, even though relatively small, may produce very large changes in phenytoin concentrations. In such cases, the half-life of the drug increases markedly, steady state is not achieved in routine fashion (since the plasma level continues to rise), and patients quickly develop symptoms of toxicity.

\section*{Figure 24-3.}

Nonlinear relationship of phenytoin dosage and plasma concentrations. Five different patients (identified by different symbols) received increasing dosages of phenytoin by mouth, and the steady-state serum concentration was measured at each dosage. The curves are not linear, since, as the dosage increases, the metabolism is saturable. Note also the marked variation among patients in the serum levels achieved at any dosage. (Modified, with permission, from J usko WJ: Bioavailability and disposition kinetics of phenytoin in man. In: Kellaway P, Peterson I [editors]: Quantitative Analytic Studies in Epilepsy. Raven Press, 1977.)

The half-life of phenytoin varies from 12 hours to 36 hours, with an average of 24 hours for most patients in the low to mid therapeutic range. Much longer half-lives are observed at higher concentrations. At low blood levels, it takes 5-7 days to reach steady-state blood levels after every dosage change; at higher levels, it may be 4-6 weeks before blood levels are stable.

\section*{Therapeutic Levels \& Dosage}

The therapeutic plasma level of phenytoin for most patients is between 10 and $20 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. A loading dose can be given either orally or intravenously; the latter, using fosphenytoin, is the method of choice for convulsive status epilepticus (discussed later). When oral therapy is started, it is common to begin
adults at a dosage of $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, regardless of body weight. This may be acceptable in some patients, but it frequently yields steady-state blood levels below $10 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$, which is the minimum therapeutic level for most patients. If seizures continue, higher doses are usually necessary to achieve plasma levels in the upper therapeutic range. Because of its dose-dependent kinetics, some toxicity may occur with only small increments in dosage. The phenytoin dosage should be increased each time by only $25-30 \mathrm{mg}$ in adults, and ample time should be allowed for the new steady state to be achieved before further increasing the dosage. A common clinical error is to increase the dosage directly from 300 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ to $400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$; toxicity frequently occurs at a variable time thereafter. In children, a dosage of 5 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ should be followed by readjustment after steady-state plasma levels are obtained.

Two types of oral phenytoin sodium are currently available in the USA, differing in their respective rates of dissolution; one is absorbed rapidly and one more slowly. Only the slow-release extendedaction formulation can be given in a single daily dosage, and care must be used when changing brands (see Preparations Available). Although a few patients being given phenytoin on a long-term basis have been proved to have low blood levels from poor absorption or rapid metabolism, the most common cause of low levels is poor compliance. Fosphenytoin sodium is available for intravenous or intramuscular use and replaces intravenous phenytoin sodium, a much less soluble form of the drug.

\section*{Drug I nteractions \& I nterference with Laboratory Tests}

Drug interactions involving phenytoin are primarily related to protein binding or to metabolism. Since phenytoin is $90 \%$ bound to plasma proteins, other highly bound drugs, such as phenylbutazone and sulfonamides, can displace phenytoin from its binding site. In theory, such displacement may cause a transient increase in free drug. A decrease in protein binding-eg, from hypoalbuminemia-results in a decrease in the total plasma concentration of drug but not the free concentration. Intoxication may occur if efforts are made to maintain total drug levels in the therapeutic range by increasing the dose. The protein binding of phenytoin is decreased in the presence of renal disease. The drug has an affinity for thyroid-binding globulin, which confuses some tests of thyroid function; the most reliable screening test of thyroid function in patients taking phenytoin appears to be measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

Phenytoin has been shown to induce microsomal enzymes responsible for the metabolism of a number of drugs. Autostimulation of its own metabolism, however, appears to be insignificant. Other drugs, notably phenobarbital and carbamazepine, cause decreases in phenytoin steady-state concentrations through induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes. On the other hand, isoniazid inhibits the metabolism of phenytoin, resulting in increased steady-state concentrations when the two drugs are given together.

\section*{Toxicity}

Dose-related adverse effects caused by phenytoin are unfortunately similar to other antiseizure drugs in this group, making differentiation difficult in patients receiving multiple drugs. Nystagmus occurs early, as does loss of smooth extraocular pursuit movements, but neither is an indication for decreasing the dose. Diplopia and ataxia are the most common dose-related adverse effects requiring dosage adjustment; sedation usually occurs only at considerably higher levels. Gingival hyperplasia and hirsutism occur to some degree in most patients; the latter can be especially unpleasant in women. Long-term use is associated in some patients with coarsening of facial features and with mild
peripheral neuropathy, usually manifested by diminished deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities. Long-term use may also result in abnormalities of vitamin D metabolism, leading to osteomalacia. Low folate levels and megaloblastic anemia have been reported, but the clinical importance of this observation is unknown.

Idiosyncratic reactions to phenytoin are relatively rare. A skin rash may indicate hypersensitivity of the patient to the drug. Fever may also occur, and in rare cases the skin lesions may be severe and exfoliative. Lymphadenopathy may be difficult to distinguish from malignant lymphoma, and although some studies suggest a causal relationship between phenytoin and Hodgkin's disease, the data are far from conclusive. Hematologic complications are exceedingly rare, although agranulocytosis has been reported in combination with fever and rash.

\section*{MEPHENYTOI N, ETHOTOI N, \& PHENACEMI DE}

Many congeners of phenytoin have been synthesized, but only three have been marketed recently in the USA, and one of these (phenacemide) has been withdrawn from the market. The other two congeners, mephenytoin and ethotoin, like phenytoin, appear to be most effective against generalized tonic-clonic seizures and partial seizures. No well-controlled clinical trials have documented their effectiveness. The incidence of severe reactions such as dermatitis, agranulocytosis, or hepatitis is higher for mephenytoin than for phenytoin.

Ethotoin may be recommended for patients hypersensitive to phenytoin, but larger doses are required. The adverse effects and toxicity are generally less severe than those associated with phenytoin, but the drug appears to be less effective.

Both ethotoin and mephenytoin share with phenytoin the property of saturable metabolism within the therapeutic dosage range. Careful monitoring of the patient during dosage alterations with either drug is essential. Mephenytoin is metabolized to 5,5-ethylphenylhydantoin via demethylation. This metabolite, nirvanol, contributes most of the antiseizure activity of mephenytoin. Both mephenytoin and nirvanol are hydroxylated and undergo subsequent conjugation and excretion. Therapeutic levels for mephenytoin range from $5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ to $16 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$, and levels above $20 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ are considered toxic.

Therapeutic blood levels of nirvanol are between 25 and $40 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. A therapeutic range for ethotoin has not been established.

\section*{CARBAMAZEPINE}

Closely related to imipramine and other antidepressants, carbamazepine is a tricyclic compound effective in treatment of bipolar depression. It was initially marketed for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia but has proved useful for epilepsy as well.
<smiles>NC(=O)N1c2ccccc2C=Cc2ccccc21</smiles>

\section*{Chemistry}

Although not obvious from a two-dimensional representation of its structure, carbamazepine has many similarities to phenytoin. The ureide moiety ( $-\mathrm{N}-\mathrm{CO}-\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ ) present in the heterocyclic ring of most antiseizure drugs is also present in carbamazepine. Three-dimensional structural studies indicate that its spatial conformation is similar to that of phenytoin.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

The mechanism of action of carbamazepine appears to be similar to that of phenytoin. Like phenytoin, carbamazepine shows activity against maximal electroshock seizures. Carbamazepine, like phenytoin, blocks sodium channels at therapeutic concentrations and inhibits high-frequency repetitive firing in neurons in culture (Figure 24-2). It also acts presynaptically to decrease synaptic transmission. These effects probably account for the anticonvulsant action of carbamazepine. Binding studies show that carbamazepine interacts with adenosine receptors, but the functional significance of this observation is not known.

\section*{Clinical Use}

Although carbamazepine has long been considered a drug of choice for both partial seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, some of the newer antiseizure drugs are beginning to displace it from this role. Carbamazepine is not sedative in its usual therapeutic range. The drug is also very effective in some patients with trigeminal neuralgia, although older patients may tolerate higher doses poorly, with ataxia and unsteadiness. Carbamazepine is also useful in some patients with mania (bipolar disorder).

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

The rate of absorption of carbamazepine varies widely among patients, although almost complete absorption apparently occurs in all. Peak levels are usually achieved 6-8 hours after administration. Slowing absorption by giving the drug after meals helps the patient tolerate larger total daily doses.

Distribution is slow, and the volume of distribution is roughly $1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{kg}$. The drug is only $70 \%$ bound to plasma proteins; no displacement of other drugs from protein binding sites has been observed.

Carbamazepine has a very low systemic clearance of approximately $1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ at the start of therapy. The drug has a notable ability to induce microsomal enzymes. Typically, the half-life of 36 hours observed in subjects following an initial single dose decreases to as short as 8-12 hours in subjects receiving continuous therapy. Considerable dosage adjustments are thus to be expected during the first weeks of therapy. Carbamazepine also alters the clearance of other drugs (see below).

Carbamazepine is completely metabolized in humans to several derivatives. One of these,
carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, has been shown to have anticonvulsant activity. The contribution of this and other metabolites to the clinical activity of carbamazepine is unknown.

\section*{Therapeutic Levels \& Dosage}

Carbamazepine is available only in oral form. The drug is effective in children, in whom a dosage of $15-25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ is appropriate. In adults, daily doses of 1 g or even 2 g are tolerated. Higher dosage is achieved by giving multiple divided doses daily. Extended-release preparations permit twice-daily dosing for most patients. In patients in whom the blood is drawn just before the morning dose (trough level), the therapeutic level is usually $4-8 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Although many patients complain of diplopia at drug levels above $7 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$, others can tolerate levels above $10 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$, especially with monotherapy.

\section*{Drug I nteractions}

Drug interactions involving carbamazepine are almost exclusively related to the drug's enzymeinducing properties. As noted previously, the increased metabolic capacity of the hepatic enzymes may cause a reduction in steady-state carbamazepine concentrations and an increased rate of metabolism of other drugs, eg, primidone, phenytoin, ethosuximide, valproic acid, and clonazepam. Other drugs such as propoxyphene, troleandomycin, and valproic acid may inhibit carbamazepine clearance and increase steady-state carbamazepine blood levels. Other anticonvulsants, however, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, may decrease steady-state concentrations of carbamazepine through enzyme induction. No clinically significant protein-binding interactions have been reported.

\section*{Toxicity}

The most common dose-related adverse effects of carbamazepine are diplopia and ataxia. The diplopia often occurs first and may last less than an hour during a particular time of day. Rearrangement of the divided daily dose can often remedy this complaint. Other dose-related complaints include mild gastrointestinal upsets, unsteadiness, and, at much higher doses, drowsiness. Hyponatremia and water intoxication have occasionally occurred and may be dose-related.

Considerable concern exists regarding the occurrence of idiosyncratic blood dyscrasias with carbamazepine, including fatal cases of aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis. Most of these have been in elderly patients with trigeminal neuralgia, and most have occurred within the first 4 months of treatment. The mild and persistent leukopenia seen in some patients is not necessarily an indication to stop treatment but requires careful monitoring. The most common idiosyncratic reaction is an erythematous skin rash; other responses such as hepatic dysfunction are unusual.

\section*{OXCARBAZEPINE}

Oxcarbazepine is closely related to carbamazepine and useful in the same seizure types, but it may have an improved toxicity profile. Oxcarbazepine has a half-life of only 1-2 hours. Its activity, therefore, resides almost exclusively in the 10-hydroxy metabolite, to which it is rapidly converted and which has a half-life similar to that of carbamazepine, ie, $8-12$ hours. The drug is mostly excreted as the glucuronide of the 10-hydroxy metabolite. Oxcarbazepine is less potent than carbamazepine, both in animal models of epilepsy and in epileptic patients; clinical doses of oxcarbazepine may need to be $50 \%$ higher than those of carbamazepine to obtain equivalent seizure control. Some studies report fewer hypersensitivity reactions to oxcarbazepine, and cross-reactivity with carbamazepine does not
always occur. Furthermore, the drug appears to induce hepatic enzymes to a lesser extent than carbamazepine, minimizing drug interactions. Although hyponatremia may occur more commonly with oxcarbazepine than with carbamazepine, most adverse effects that occur with oxcarbazepine are similar in character to reactions reported with carbamazepine.

Oxcarbazepine

\section*{PHENOBARBITAL}

Aside from the bromides, phenobarbital is the oldest of the currently available antiseizure drugs. Although it has long been considered one of the safest of the antiseizure agents, the use of other medications with lesser sedative effects has been urged. Many consider the barbiturates the drugs of choice for seizures only in infants.

\section*{Chemistry}

The four derivatives of barbituric acid clinically useful as antiseizure drugs are phenobarbital, mephobarbital, metharbital, and primidone. The first three are so similar that they are considered together. Metharbital is methylated barbital, and mephobarbital is methylated phenobarbital; both are demethylated in vivo. The pKas of these three weak acid compounds range from 7.3 to 7.9. Slight changes in the normal acid-base balance, therefore, can cause significant fluctuation in the ratio of the ionized to the un-ionized species. This is particularly important for phenobarbital, the most commonly used barbiturate, whose pKa is similar to the plasma pH of 7.4.

The three-dimensional conformations of phenobarbital and N-methylphenobarbital are similar to that of phenytoin. Both compounds possess a phenyl ring and are active against partial seizures.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

The exact mechanism of action of phenobarbital is unknown, but enhancement of inhibitory processes and diminution of excitatory transmission probably contribute significantly. Recent data indicate that phenobarbital may selectively suppress abnormal neurons, inhibiting the spread and suppressing firing from the foci. Like phenytoin, phenobarbital suppresses high-frequency repetitive firing in neurons in culture through an action on $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$conductance, but only at high concentrations. Also at high concentrations, barbiturates block some $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ currents (L-type and N-type). Phenobarbital binds to an allosteric regulatory site on the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor, and it enhances the GABA receptor-mediated current by prolonging the openings of the chloride channels. Phenobarbital also blocks excitatory responses induced by glutamate, principally those mediated by activation of the AMPA receptor (see Chapter 21). Both the enhancement of GABA-mediated inhibition and the reduction of glutamate-mediated excitation are seen with therapeutically relevant concentrations of phenobarbital.

\section*{Clinical Use}

Phenobarbital is useful in the treatment of partial seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, although the drug is often tried for virtually every seizure type, especially when attacks are difficult to control. There is little evidence for its effectiveness in generalized seizures such as absence, atonic attacks, and infantile spasms; it may worsen certain patients with these seizure types.

Some physicians prefer either metharbital or mephobarbital-especially the latter-to phenobarbital because of supposed decreased adverse effects. Only anecdotal data are available to support such comparisons.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

See Chapter 22.

\section*{Therapeutic Levels \& Dosage}

The therapeutic levels of phenobarbital in most patients range from $10 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ to $40 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Documentation of effectiveness is best in febrile seizures, and levels below $15 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ appear ineffective for prevention of febrile seizure recurrence. The upper end of the therapeutic range is more difficult to define, because many patients appear to tolerate chronic levels above $40 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$.

\section*{Drug I nteractions \& Toxicity}

See Chapter 22.

\section*{PRI MI DONE}

Primidone, or 2-desoxyphenobarbital (Figure 24-4), was first marketed in the early 1950s. It was later reported that primidone was metabolized to phenobarbital and phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA). All three compounds are active anticonvulsants.

Figure 24-4.
Crimidone

\section*{Phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA)}

Primidone and its active metabolites.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Although primidone is converted to phenobarbital, the mechanism of action of primidone itself may be more like that of phenytoin.

\section*{Clinical Use}

Primidone, like its metabolites, is effective against partial seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures and may be more effective than phenobarbital. It was previously considered to be the drug of choice for complex partial seizures, but the latest studies of partial seizures in adults strongly suggest that carbamazepine and phenytoin are superior to primidone. Attempts to determine the relative potencies of the parent drug and its two metabolites have been conducted in newborn infants, in whom drugmetabolizing enzyme systems are very immature and in whom primidone is only slowly metabolized. Primidone has been shown to be effective in controlling seizures in this group and in older patients beginning treatment with primidone; older patients show seizure control before phenobarbital concentrations reach the therapeutic range. Finally, studies of maximal electroshock seizures in animals suggest that primidone has an anticonvulsant action independent of its conversion to phenobarbital and PEMA (the latter is relatively weak).

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Primidone is completely absorbed, usually reaching peak concentrations about 3 hours after oral administration, although considerable variation has been reported. Primidone is generally confined to total body water, with a volume of distribution of $0.6 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{kg}$. It is not highly bound to plasma proteins; approximately 70\% circulates as unbound drug.

Primidone is metabolized by oxidation to phenobarbital, which accumulates very slowly, and by scission of the heterocyclic ring to form PEMA (Figure 24-4). Both primidone and phenobarbital also undergo subsequent conjugation and excretion.

Primidone has a larger clearance than most other antiseizure drugs ( $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ), corresponding to a half-life of 6-8 hours. PEMA clearance is approximately half that of primidone, but phenobarbital has a very low clearance. The appearance of phenobarbital corresponds to the disappearance of primidone. Phenobarbital therefore accumulates very slowly but eventually reaches therapeutic concentrations in most patients when therapeutic doses of primidone are administered. During chronic therapy, phenobarbital levels derived from primidone are usually two to three times higher than primidone levels. PEMA, which probably makes a minimal contribution to the efficacy of primidone, has a half-life of 8-12 hours and therefore reaches steady state more rapidly than phenobarbital.

\section*{Therapeutic Levels \& Dosage}

Primidone is most efficacious when plasma levels are in the range of $8-12 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Concomitant levels of its metabolite, phenobarbital, at steady state usually vary from $15 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ to $30 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Dosages of $10-20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ are necessary to obtain these levels. It is very important, however, to start primidone at low doses and gradually increase over days to a few weeks to avoid prominent sedation and gastrointestinal complaints. When adjusting doses of the drug, it is important to remember that the parent drug reaches steady state rapidly (30-40 hours), but the active metabolites phenobarbital (20 days) and PEMA (3-4 days) reach steady state much more slowly.

\section*{Toxicity}

The dose-related adverse effects of primidone are similar to those of its metabolite, phenobarbital, except that drowsiness occurs early in treatment and may be prominent if the initial dose is too large. Gradual increments are indicated when starting the drug in either children or adults.

\section*{VIGABATRI N}

Current investigations that seek drugs to enhance the effects of GABA include efforts to find GABA agonists and prodrugs, GABA transaminase inhibitors, and GABA uptake inhibitors. Vigabatrin ( $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$-vinylGABA) is one of these drugs and has been registered in Canada, Europe, and South America.
<smiles>C=CC(N)CCC(=O)O</smiles>

\section*{Vigabatrin}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Vigabatrin is an irreversible inhibitor of GABA aminotransferase (GABA-T), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of GABA. It apparently acts by increasing the amount of GABA released at synaptic sites, thereby enhancing inhibitory effects. A decrease in brain glutamine synthetase activity is probably secondary to the increased GABA concentrations. It is effective in a wide range of seizure models. Vigabatrin is marketed as a racemate; the $S(+)$ enantiomer is active and the $R(-)$ enantiomer appears to be inactive.

\section*{Clinical Use}

Vigabatrin is useful in the treatment of partial seizures and West's syndrome. The half-life is approximately $6-8$ hours, but considerable evidence suggests that the pharmacodynamic activity of the drug is more prolonged and not well correlated with the plasma half-life. In adults, vigabatrin should be started at an oral dosage of 500 mg twice daily; a total of $2-3 \mathrm{~g}$ (rarely more) daily may be required for full effectiveness. Typical toxicities include drowsiness, dizziness, and weight gain. Less common but more troublesome adverse reactions are agitation, confusion, and psychosis; preexisting mental illness is a relative contraindication. The drug was delayed in its worldwide introduction by the appearance in rats and dogs of a reversible intramyelinic edema; this phenomenon has not been observed in any patient to date. More recently, unfortunately, long-term therapy with vigabatrin has been associated with development of visual field defects in up to one third of patients. This adverse effect may not be reversible, and vigabatrin may therefore be relegated to use in patients-such as those with infantile spasms-who are refractory to other treatments.

\section*{LAMOTRI GI NE}

Lamotrigine was developed when some investigators thought that the antifolate effects of certain antiseizure drugs (eg, phenytoin) may contribute to their effectiveness. Several phenyltriazines were developed, and although their antifolate properties were weak, some were active in seizure screening tests.
<smiles>Nc1nnc(-c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl)c(N)n1</smiles>

\section*{Lamotrigine}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Lamotrigine, like phenytoin, suppresses sustained rapid firing of neurons and produces a voltage- and use-dependent inactivation of sodium channels. This action probably explains lamotrigine's efficacy in focal epilepsy. It appears likely that lamotrigine has another mechanism of action to account for its efficacy in primary generalized seizures in childhood, including absence attacks; this mechanism may involve actions on voltage-activated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. Lamotrigine also decreases the synaptic release of glutamate.

\section*{Clinical Use}

Although most controlled studies have evaluated lamotrigine as add-on therapy, some suggest that the drug is effective as monotherapy for partial seizures, and the drug is now widely prescribed for this indication. Some authorities feel that the drug is also active against absence and myoclonic seizures in children. Adverse effects include dizziness, headache, diplopia, nausea, somnolence, and skin rash.

The rash is considered a typical hypersensitivity reaction. Although the risk of rash may be diminished by introducing the drug slowly, pediatric patients are at high risk; some studies suggest that a potentially life-threatening dermatitis will develop in 1-2\% of pediatric patients.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

Lamotrigine is almost completely absorbed and has a volume of distribution in the range of 1-1.4 L/kg. Protein binding is only about $55 \%$. The drug has linear kinetics and is metabolized primarily by glucuronidation to the 2-N-glucuronide, which is excreted in the urine. Lamotrigine has a half-life of approximately 24 hours in normal volunteers; this decreases to 13-15 hours in patients taking enzyme-inducing drugs. Lamotrigine is effective against partial seizures in adults, with dosages typically between 100 and $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ and with a therapeutic blood level near $3 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Valproate causes a twofold increase in the drug's half-life; in patients receiving valproate, the initial dosage of lamotrigine must be reduced to 25 mg every other day.

\section*{FELBAMATE}

Felbamate has been approved and marketed in the USA and in some European countries. Although it is effective in some patients with partial seizures, the drug causes aplastic anemia and severe hepatitis at unexpectedly high rates and has been relegated to the status of a third-line drug for refractory cases.

Felbamate appears to have multiple mechanisms of action. It produces a use-dependent block of the NMDA receptor, with selectivity for the NR1-2B subtype. It also potentiates GABA receptor responses. Felbamate has a half-life of 20 hours (somewhat shorter when administered with either phenytoin or carbamazepine) and is metabolized by hydroxylation and conjugation; a significant percentage of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. When added to treatment with other antiseizure drugs, felbamate increases plasma phenytoin and valproic acid levels but decreases levels of carbamazepine.
<smiles>N[14C](N)CC(C[14C](N)=O)c1ccccc1</smiles>

\section*{Felbamate}

In spite of the seriousness of the adverse effects, thousands of patients worldwide remain on the medication. Usual dosages are $2000-4000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ in adults, and effective plasma levels range from 30 $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ to $100 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. In addition to its usefulness in partial seizures, felbamate has proved effective against the seizures that occur in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

\section*{GABAPENTIN \& PREGABALI N}

Gabapentin is an amino acid, an analog of GABA, that is effective against partial seizures. Originally planned as a spasmolytic, it was found to be more effective as an antiseizure drug. Pregabalin is another GABA analog, closely related to gabapentin. This drug was recently approved in the USA for both antiseizure activity and for its analgesic properties.
<smiles>NCC1(CC(=O)O)CCCCC1</smiles>

\section*{Gabapentin}
<smiles>CC(C)CC(CN)CC(=O)O</smiles>

\section*{Pregabalin}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

In spite of their close structural resemblance to GABA, gabapentin and pregabalin do not act directly on GABA receptors. They may, however, modify the synaptic or nonsynaptic release of GABA. An increase in brain GABA concentration is observed in patients receiving gabapentin. Gabapentin is transported into the brain by the L-amino acid transporter. Gabapentin and pregabalin bind avidly to the $a .2 \delta$ subunit of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. Gabapentin and pregabalin also act presynaptically to decrease the release of glutamate; this effect is probably dependent on reduced presynaptic entry of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ via voltage-activated channels.

\section*{Clinical Use \& Dosage}

Gabapentin is effective as an adjunct against partial seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures at dosages that range up to $2400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ in controlled clinical trials. Open follow-on studies permitted dosages up to $4800 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, but data are inconclusive on the effectiveness or tolerability of such doses. Monotherapy studies also document some efficacy. Some clinicians have found that very high dosages are needed to achieve improvement in seizure control. Effectiveness in other seizure types has not been well demonstrated. Gabapentin has also been found effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain and is now indicated for postherpetic neuralgia in adults at doses of 1800 mg and above. The most common adverse effects are somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, headache, and tremor.

Pregabalin is approved (as an adjunct) for the treatment of partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization; controlled clinical trials have documented its effectiveness. It is available only in oral form, and the daily dose ranges from $150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ to $600 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, usually in two or three divided administrations. Pregabalin is also approved for use in neuropathic pain, including painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Gabapentin is not metabolized and does not induce hepatic enzymes. Absorption is nonlinear and dose-dependent at very high doses, but otherwise the elimination kinetics are linear. The drug is not bound to plasma proteins. Drug-drug interactions are negligible. Elimination is via renal mechanisms; the drug is excreted unchanged. The half-life is short, ranging from 5 hours to 8 hours; the drug is typically administered two or three times per day.

Pregabalin, like gabapentin, is not metabolized and is almost entirely excreted unchanged in the urine. It is not bound to plasma proteins and has virtually no drug-drug interactions, again resembling the
characteristics of gabapentin. Likewise, other drugs do not affect the pharmacokinetics of pregabalin. The half-life of pregabalin ranges from about 4.5 hours to 7.0 hours, thus requiring more than once-per-day dosing in most patients.

\section*{LEVETI RACETAM}

Levetiracetam is a piracetam analog that is ineffective against seizures induced by maximum electroshock or pentylenetetrazol but has prominent activity in the kindling model.
<smiles>CCC(C(N)=O)N1CCCCC1=O</smiles>

Levetiracetam

Levetiracetam binds selectively to a synaptic vesicular protein SV2A. The function of this protein is not understood but it is likely that levetiracetam modifies the synaptic release of glutamate and GABA through an action on vesicular function.

The drug is marketed for the treatment of partial seizures. Oral absorption is nearly complete; it is rapid and unaffected by food, with peak plasma concentrations in 1.3 hours. Kinetics are linear. Protein binding is less than $10 \%$. The plasma half-life is $6-8$ hours and may be longer in the elderly. Two thirds of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Drug interactions are minimal; levetiracetam is not metabolized by cytochrome P450. Dosing can begin with 500 mg orally twice daily; some patients require up to $3000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. Adverse effects include somnolence, asthenia, and dizziness. Idiosyncratic reactions are rare.

\section*{TI AGABI NE}

Tiagabine is a derivative of nipecotic acid and was "rationally designed" as an inhibitor of GABA uptake (as opposed to discovery through random screening).
<smiles>Cc1ccsc1C(=CCCN1CCCC(C(=O)O)C1)c1sccc1C</smiles>

\section*{Tiagabine}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Tiagabine is an inhibitor of GABA uptake in both neurons and glia. It preferentially inhibits the transporter isoform 1 (GAT-1) rather than GAT-2 or GAT-3 and increases extracellular GABA levels in the forebrain and hippocampus. It prolongs the inhibitory action of synaptically released GABA. In rodents, it is potent against kindled seizures but weak against the maximum electroshock model.

\section*{Clinical Use}

Tiagabine is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of partial seizures and is effective in doses ranging from $16 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ to $56 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. Divided doses as often as four times per day are sometimes required. Some patients appear to do well with tiagabine monotherapy, which is generally well tolerated. Minor adverse events are dose-related and include nervousness, dizziness, tremor, difficulty in concentrating, and depression. Excessive confusion, somnolence, or ataxia may require discontinuation. Psychosis occurs rarely. Rash is an uncommon idiosyncratic adverse effect. Laboratory studies are usually normal.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Tiagabine is $90-100 \%$ bioavailable, has linear kinetics, and is highly protein-bound. The half-life is $5-8$ hours and decreases in the presence of enzyme-inducing drugs. Food decreases the peak plasma concentration but not the area under the concentration curve (see Chapter 3). Hepatic impairment causes a slight decrease in clearance (and may necessitate a lower dose), but the drug does not cause inhibition or induction of hepatic enzymes. The drug is oxidized in the liver by CYP3A. Elimination is primarily in the feces (60-65\%) and urine (25\%).

\section*{TOPI RAMATE}

Topiramate is a substituted monosaccharide that is structurally different from all other antiseizure drugs.
<smiles>CC1(C)OC2COC3(CON)OC(C)(C)OC3C2O1</smiles>

\section*{Topiramate}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Topiramate blocks repetitive firing of cultured spinal cord neurons, as do phenytoin and carbamazepine. Its mechanism of action, therefore, is likely to involve blocking of voltage-gated sodium channels. Topiramate also appears to potentiate the inhibitory effect of GABA, acting at a site different from the benzodiazepine or barbiturate sites. Topiramate also depresses the excitatory action of kainate on glutamate receptors. It is possible that all three of these actions contribute to topiramate's anticonvulsant effect.

\section*{Clinical Use}

Clinical trials of topiramate demonstrated a dose-response relationship, and monotherapy trials showed the drug to be effective against partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Good evidence suggests that the drug has a broader spectrum, with effectiveness against Lennox-Gestaut syndrome,

West's syndrome, and even absence seizures. Topiramate is also approved for the treatment of migraine headaches. Dosages typically range from $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ to $600 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, with a few patients tolerating dosages higher than $1000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. Most clinicians begin at a low dose ( $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) and increase slowly to avoid adverse effects. Although no idiosyncratic reactions have been noted, dose-related adverse effects occur most frequently in the first 4 weeks and include somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, cognitive slowing, paresthesias, nervousness, and confusion. Acute myopia and glaucoma may require prompt drug withdrawal. Urolithiasis has also been reported. However, the discontinuation rate is apparently only about $15 \%$. The drug is teratogenic in animal models, and hypospadias has been reported in male infants exposed in utero to topiramate; however, no causal relationship could be established.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Topiramate is rapidly absorbed (about 2 hours) and is $80 \%$ bioavailable. There is no food effect on absorption, minimal (15\%) plasma protein binding, and only moderate (20-50\%) metabolism; no active metabolites are formed. The drug is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. The half-life is 20-30 hours. Although increased levels are seen with renal failure and hepatic impairment, there is no age or gender effect, no autoinduction, no inhibition of metabolism, and kinetics are linear. Drug interactions do occur and can be complex, but the major effect is on topiramate levels rather than on the levels of other antiseizure drugs. Birth control pills may be less effective in the presence of topiramate, and higher estrogen doses may be required.

\section*{ZONI SAMI DE}

Zonisamide is a sulfonamide derivative. Its primary site of action appears to be the sodium channel; it may also act on voltage-gated calcium channels. The drug is effective against partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures and may also be useful against infantile spasms and certain myoclonias. It has good bioavailability, linear kinetics, low protein-binding, renal excretion, and a half-life of 1-3 days. Doses range from $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ to $600 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ in adults and from $4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ to $12 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ in children. Adverse effects include drowsiness, cognitive impairment, and potentially serious skin rashes. Zonisamide does not interact with other antiseizure drugs.

\section*{Drugs Used in Generalized Seizures ETHOSUXI MI DE}

Ethosuximide was introduced in 1960 as the third of three marketed succinimides in the USA. Ethosuximide has very little activity against maximal electroshock but considerable efficacy against pentylenetetrazol seizures, and it was introduced as a "pure petit mal" drug. Its continued popularity is based on its safety and efficacy, and its role as the first choice anti-absence drug remains undiminished-in part because of the idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity of the alternative drug, valproic acid.

\section*{Chemistry}

Ethosuximide is the last antiseizure drug to be marketed whose origin is in the cyclic ureide structure. The three antiseizure succinimides marketed in the USA are ethosuximide, phensuximide, and methsuximide. Methsuximide and phensuximide have phenyl substituents, whereas ethosuximide is 2-ethyl-2-methylsuccinimide.
<smiles>CC1(C)CC(=O)NC1=O</smiles>

Ethosuximide

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Ethosuximide has an important effect on $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ currents, reducing the low-threshold (T-type) current. This effect is seen at therapeutically relevant concentrations in thalamic neurons. The T-type calcium currents are thought to provide a pacemaker current in thalamic neurons responsible for generating the rhythmic cortical discharge of an absence attack. Inhibition of this current could therefore account for the specific therapeutic action of ethosuximide.

\section*{Clinical Use}

As predicted from its activity in laboratory models, ethosuximide is particularly effective against absence seizures, but has a very narrow spectrum of clinical activity. Documentation of its effectiveness in human absence seizures was achieved with long-term electroencephalographic recording techniques.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Absorption is complete following administration of the oral dosage forms. Peak levels are observed 3-7 hours after oral administration of the capsules. Ethosuximide is not protein-bound.

Ethosuximide is completely metabolized, principally by hydroxylation, to inactive metabolites. The drug has a very low total body clearance ( $0.25 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ ). This corresponds to a half-life of approximately 40 hours, although values from 18 to 72 hours have been reported.

\section*{Therapeutic Levels \& Dosage}

Therapeutic levels of $60-100 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ can be achieved in adults with dosages of $750-1500 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, although lower or higher dosages and blood levels may be necessary and tolerated (up to 125 $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ ) in some patients. Ethosuximide has a linear relationship between dose and steady-state plasma levels. The drug might be administered as a single daily dose were it not for its adverse gastrointestinal effects; twice-a-day dosage is common.

\section*{Drug I nteractions}

Administration of ethosuximide with valproic acid results in a decrease in ethosuximide clearance and higher steady-state concentrations owing to inhibition of metabolism. No other important drug
interactions have been reported for the succinimides.

\section*{Toxicity}

The most common dose-related adverse effect of ethosuximide is gastric distress, including pain, nausea, and vomiting. When an adverse effect does occur, temporary dosage reductions may allow adaptation. Ethosuximide is a highly efficacious and safe drug for absence seizures; the appearance of relatively mild, dose-related adverse effects should not immediately call for its abandonment. Other dose-related adverse effects include transient lethargy or fatigue and, much less commonly, headache, dizziness, hiccup, and euphoria. Behavioral changes are usually in the direction of improvement.

Non-dose-related or idiosyncratic adverse effects of ethosuximide are extremely uncommon. Skin rashes have been reported, including at least one case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The development of systemic lupus erythematosus has also been reported, but other drugs may have been involved.

\section*{PHENSUXI MI DE \& METHSUXI MI DE}

Phensuximide and methsuximide are phenylsuccinimides that were developed and marketed before ethosuximide. They are used primarily as anti-absence drugs. Methsuximide is generally considered more toxic, and phensuximide less effective, than ethosuximide. Unlike ethosuximide, these two compounds have some activity against maximal electroshock seizures, and methsuximide has been used for partial seizures by some investigators. The desmethyl metabolite of methsuximide has a halflife of 25 hours or more and exerts the major antiseizure effect. The toxicity and reduced effectiveness of phensuximide when compared with methsuximide has been investigated, and the failure of the desmethyl metabolite to accumulate in the former probably explains its relatively weak effect.

\section*{VALPROI C ACID \& SODI UM VALPROATE}

Sodium valproate, also used as the free acid, valproic acid, was found to have antiseizure properties when it was used as a solvent in the search for other drugs effective against seizures. It was marketed in France in 1969 but was not licensed in the USA until 1978. Valproic acid is fully ionized at body pH, and for that reason the active form of the drug may be assumed to be the valproate ion regardless of whether valproic acid or a salt of the acid is administered.

\section*{Chemistry}

Valproic acid is one of a series of fatty carboxylic acids that have antiseizure activity; this activity appears to be greatest for carbon chain lengths of five to eight atoms. The amides and esters of valproic acid are also active antiseizure agents.

\section*{Valproic acid}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

The time course of valproate's anticonvulsant activity appears to be poorly correlated with blood or tissue levels of the parent drug, an observation giving rise to considerable speculation regarding both
the active species and the mechanism of action of valproic acid. Valproate is active against both pentylenetetrazol and maximal electroshock seizures. Like phenytoin and carbamazepine, valproate blocks sustained high-frequency repetitive firing of neurons in culture at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Its action against partial seizures may be a consequence of this effect on $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$currents. Blockade of NMDA receptor-mediated excitation may also be important. Much attention has been paid to the effects of valproate on GABA. Several studies have shown increased levels of GABA in the brain after administration of valproate, although the mechanism for this increase remains unclear. An effect of valproate to facilitate glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme responsible for GABA synthesis, has been described. An inhibitory effect on the GABA transporter GAT-1 may contribute. At very high concentrations, valproate inhibits GABA transaminase in the brain, thus blocking degradation of GABA. However, at the relatively low doses of valproate needed to abolish pentylenetetrazol seizures, brain GABA levels may remain unchanged. Valproate produces a reduction in the aspartate content of rodent brain, but the relevance of this effect to its anticonvulsant action is not known.

Valproic acid is a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase and through this mechanism changes the transcription of many genes. A similar effect, but to a lesser degree, is shown by some other antiseizure drugs (topiramate, carbamazepine, and a metabolite of levetiracetam).

\section*{Clinical Use}

Valproate is very effective against absence seizures. Although ethosuximide is the drug of choice when absence seizures occur alone, valproate is preferred when the patient has concomitant generalized tonic-clonic attacks. The reason for preferring ethosuximide for uncomplicated absence seizures is valproate's idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity, described below. Valproate is unique in its ability to control certain types of myoclonic seizures; in some cases the effect is very dramatic. The drug is effective in generalized tonic-clonic seizures, especially those which are primarily generalized. A few patients with atonic attacks may also respond, and some evidence suggests that the drug is effective in partial seizures.

Other uses of valproate include management of bipolar disorder and migraine prophylaxis.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Valproate is well absorbed following an oral dose, with bioavailability greater than $80 \%$. Peak blood levels are observed within 2 hours. Food may delay absorption, and decreased toxicity may result if the drug is given after meals.

Valproic acid is $90 \%$ bound to plasma proteins, although the fraction bound is somewhat reduced at blood levels greater than $150 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Since valproate is both highly ionized and highly protein-bound, its distribution is essentially confined to extracellular water, with a volume of distribution of approximately $0.15 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{kg}$.

Clearance for valproate is low; its half-life varies from 9 hours to 18 hours. Approximately 20\% of the drug is excreted as a direct conjugate of valproate.

The sodium salt of valproate is marketed in Europe as a tablet and is quite hygroscopic. In Central and South America, the magnesium salt is available, which is considerably less hygroscopic. The free acid of valproate was first marketed in the USA in a capsule containing corn oil; the sodium salt is also available in syrup, primarily for pediatric use. An enteric-coated tablet of divalproex sodium is also
marketed in the USA. This improved product, a $1: 1$ coordination compound of valproic acid and sodium valproate, is as bioavailable as the capsule but is absorbed much more slowly and is preferred by many patients. Peak concentrations following administration of the enteric-coated tablets are seen in 3-4 hours.

\section*{Therapeutic Levels \& Dosage}

Dosages of $25-30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ may be adequate in some patients, but others may require $60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ or even more. Therapeutic levels of valproate range from $50 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ to $100 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$.

\section*{Drug I nteractions}

The clearance of valproate is dose-dependent, caused by changes in both the intrinsic clearance and protein binding. At higher doses, there is an increased free fraction of valproate, resulting in lower total drug levels than expected. It may be clinically useful, therefore, to measure both total and free drug levels. Valproate also displaces phenytoin from plasma proteins. In addition to binding interactions, valproate inhibits the metabolism of several drugs, including phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine, leading to higher steady-state concentrations of these agents. The inhibition of phenobarbital metabolism, for example, may cause levels of the barbiturate to rise steeply, causing stupor or coma.

\section*{Toxicity}

The most common dose-related adverse effects of valproate are nausea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal complaints such as abdominal pain and heartburn. The drug should be started gradually to avoid these symptoms. Sedation is uncommon with valproate alone but may be striking when valproate is added to phenobarbital. A fine tremor is frequently seen at higher levels. Other reversible adverse effects, seen in a small number of patients, include weight gain, increased appetite, and hair loss.

The idiosyncratic toxicity of valproate is largely limited to hepatotoxicity, but this may be severe; there seems little doubt that the hepatotoxicity of valproate has been responsible for more than 50 fatalities in the USA alone. The risk is greatest for patients under the age of 2 years and for those taking multiple medications. Initial aspartate aminotransferase values may not be elevated in susceptible patients, although these levels do eventually become abnormal. Most fatalities have occurred within 4 months after initiation of therapy. Some clinicians recommend treatment with oral or intravenous Lcarnitine as soon as severe hepatotoxicity is suspected. Careful monitoring of liver function is recommended when starting the drug; the hepatotoxicity is reversible in some cases if the drug is withdrawn. The other observed idiosyncratic response with valproate is thrombocytopenia, although documented cases of abnormal bleeding are lacking. It should be noted that valproate is an effective and popular antiseizure drug and that only a very small number of patients have had severe toxic effects from its use.

Several epidemiologic studies of valproate have confirmed an increased incidence of spina bifida in the offspring of women who took valproate during pregnancy. In addition, an increased incidence of cardiovascular, orofacial, and digital abnormalities has been reported. These observations must be strongly considered in the choice of drugs during pregnancy.

\section*{OXAZOLI DI NEDI ONES}

Trimethadione, the first oxazolidinedione, was introduced as an antiseizure drug in 1945 and remained the drug of choice for absence seizures until the introduction of succinimides in the 1950s. The use of the oxazolidinediones (trimethadione, paramethadione, and dimethadione) is now very limited.

The oxazolidinediones contain an oxazolidine heterocyclic ring (Figure 24-1) and are similar in structure to other antiseizure drugs introduced before 1960. The structure includes only short-chain alkyl substituents on the heterocyclic ring, with no attached phenyl group.
<smiles>CN1C(=O)OC(C)(C)C1=O</smiles>

\section*{Trimethadione}

These compounds are active against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. Trimethadione raises the threshold for seizure discharges following repetitive thalamic stimulation. It-or, more notably, its active metabolite dimethadione-has the same effect on thalamic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ currents as ethosuximide (reducing the T-type calcium current). Thus, suppression of absence seizures is likely to depend on inhibiting the pacemaker action of thalamic neurons.

Trimethadione is rapidly absorbed, with peak levels reached within an hour after drug administration. It is not bound to plasma proteins. Trimethadione is completely metabolized in the liver by demethylation to dimethadione, which may exert the major antiseizure activity. Dimethadione has an extremely long half-life (240 hours).

The therapeutic plasma level range for trimethadione has never been established, although trimethadione blood levels above $20 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ and dimethadione levels above $700 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ have been suggested. A dosage of $30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ of trimethadione is necessary to achieve these levels in adults.

The most common and bothersome dose-related adverse effect of the oxazolidinediones is sedation. Trimethadione has been associated with many other toxic adverse effects, some of which are severe. These drugs should not be used during pregnancy.

\section*{Other Drugs Used in Management of Epilepsy}

Some drugs not classifiable by application to seizure type are discussed in this section.

\section*{BENZODI AZEPI NES}

Six benzodiazepines play prominent roles in the therapy of epilepsy (see also Chapter 22). Although many benzodiazepines are similar chemically, subtle structural alterations result in differences in activity. They have two different mechanisms of antiseizure action, which are shown to different degrees by the six compounds. This is evident from the fact that diazepam is relatively more potent against electroshock and clonazepam against pentylenetetrazol (the latter effect correlating with an action at the GABA-benzodiazepine allosteric receptor sites). Possible mechanisms of action are discussed in Chapter 22.

Diazepam given intravenously or rectally is highly effective for stopping continuous seizure activity,
especially generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus (see below). The drug is occasionally given orally on a long-term basis, although it is not considered very effective in this application, probably because of the rapid development of tolerance. A rectal gel is available for refractory patients who need acute control of bouts of seizure activity. Lorazepam appears in some studies to be more effective and longer-acting than diazepam in the treatment of status epilepticus and is preferred by some experts.

Clonazepam is a long-acting drug with documented efficacy against absence seizures; on a milligram basis, it is one of the most potent antiseizure agents known. It is also effective in some cases of myoclonic seizures and has been tried in infantile spasms. Sedation is prominent, especially on initiation of therapy; starting doses should be small. Maximal tolerated doses are usually in the range of $0.1-0.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, but many weeks of gradually increasing daily doses may be needed to achieve these dosages in some patients. Nitrazepam is not marketed in the USA but is used in many other countries, especially for infantile spasms and myoclonic seizures. It is less potent than clonazepam, and its clinical advantages over that drug have not been documented.

Clorazepate dipotassium is approved in the USA as an adjunct to treatment of complex partial seizures in adults. Drowsiness and lethargy are common adverse effects, but as long as the drug is increased gradually, dosages as high as $45 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ can be given.

Clobazam is not available in the USA but is marketed in most countries and is widely used in a variety of seizure types. It is a 1,5-benzodiazepine (other marketed benzodiazepines are 1,4-benzodiazepines) and reportedly has less sedative potential than benzodiazepines marketed in the USA. Whether the drug has significant clinical advantages is not clear. It has a half-life of 18 hours and is effective at dosages of $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. It does interact with some other antiseizure drugs and causes adverse effects typical of the benzodiazepines; efficacy, in some patients, is limited by the development of tolerance.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

The pharmacokinetic properties of the benzodiazepines in part determine their clinical use. In general, the drugs are well absorbed, widely distributed, and extensively metabolized, with many active metabolites. The rate of distribution of benzodiazepines within the body is different from that of other antiseizure drugs. Diazepam and lorazepam in particular are rapidly and extensively distributed to the tissues, with volumes of distribution between $1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{kg}$ and $3 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{kg}$. The onset of action is very rapid. Total body clearances of the parent drug and its metabolites are low, corresponding to half-lives of 20-40 hours.

\section*{Limitations}

Two prominent aspects of benzodiazepines limit their usefulness. The first is their pronounced sedative effect, which is unfortunate both in the treatment of status epilepticus and in chronic therapy. Children may manifest a paradoxical hyperactivity, as with barbiturates. The second problem is tolerance, in which seizures may respond initially but recur within a few months. The remarkable antiseizure potency of these compounds often cannot be realized because of these limiting factors.

\section*{ACETAZOLAMI DE}

Acetazolamide is a diuretic whose main action is the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase (see Chapter 15). Mild acidosis in the brain may be the mechanism by which the drug exerts its antiseizure activity;
alternatively, the depolarizing action of bicarbonate ions moving out of neurons via GABA receptor ion channels may be diminished by carbonic anhydrase inhibition. Acetazolamide has been used for all types of seizures but is severely limited by the rapid development of tolerance, with return of seizures usually within a few weeks. The drug may have a special role in epileptic women who experience seizure exacerbations at the time of menses; seizure control may be improved and tolerance may not develop because the drug is not administered continuously. The usual dosage is approximately 10 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ to a maximum of $1000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$.

Another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, sulthiame, was not found to be effective as an anticonvulsant in clinical trials in the USA. It is marketed in some other countries.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF ANTI SEI ZURE DRUGS SEI ZURE CLASSI FI CATION}

The type of medication utilized for epilepsy depends on the empiric nature of the seizure. For this reason, considerable effort has been expended to classify seizures so that clinicians will be able to make a "seizure diagnosis" and on that basis prescribe appropriate therapy. Errors in seizure diagnosis cause use of the wrong drugs, and an unpleasant cycle ensues in which poor seizure control is followed by increasing drug doses and medication toxicity. As noted above, seizures are divided into two groups: partial and generalized. Drugs used for partial seizures are more or less the same for the entire group, but drugs used for generalized seizures are determined by the individual seizure type. A summary of the international classification of epileptic seizures is presented in Table 24-1.

\section*{Partial Seizures}

Partial seizures are those in which a localized onset of the attack can be ascertained, either by clinical observation or by electroencephalographic recording; the attack begins in a specific locus in the brain. There are three types of partial seizures, determined to some extent by the degree of brain involvement by the abnormal discharge.

The least complicated partial seizure is the simple partial seizure, characterized by minimal spread of the abnormal discharge such that normal consciousness and awareness are preserved. For example, the patient may have a sudden onset of clonic jerking of an extremity lasting 60-90 seconds; residual weakness may last for 15-30 minutes after the attack. The patient is completely aware of the attack and can describe it in detail. The electroencephalogram may show an abnormal discharge highly localized to the involved portion of the brain.

The complex partial seizure also has a localized onset, but the discharge becomes more widespread (usually bilateral) and almost always involves the limbic system. Most complex partial seizures arise from one of the temporal lobes, possibly because of the susceptibility of this area of the brain to insults such as hypoxia or infection. Clinically, the patient may have a brief warning followed by an alteration of consciousness during which some patients stare and others stagger or even fall. Most, however, demonstrate fragments of integrated motor behavior called automatisms for which the patient has no memory. Typical automatisms are lip smacking, swallowing, fumbling, scratching, or even walking about. After 30-120 seconds, the patient makes a gradual recovery to normal consciousness but may feel tired or ill for several hours after the attack.

The last type of partial seizure is the secondarily generalized attack, in which a partial seizure immediately precedes a generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure. This seizure type is described in the text that follows.

\section*{Generalized Seizures}

Generalized seizures are those in which there is no evidence of localized onset. The group is quite heterogeneous.

Generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures are the most dramatic of all epileptic seizures and are characterized by tonic rigidity of all extremities, followed in 15-30 seconds by a tremor that is actually an interruption of the tonus by relaxation. As the relaxation phases become longer, the attack enters the clonic phase, with massive jerking of the body. The clonic jerking slows over 60-120 seconds, and the patient is usually left in a stuporous state. The tongue or cheek may be bitten, and urinary incontinence is common. Primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures begin without evidence of localized onset, whereas secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures are preceded by another seizure type, usually a partial seizure. The medical treatment of both primary and secondary generalized tonicclonic seizures is the same and uses drugs appropriate for partial seizures.

The absence (petit mal) seizure is characterized by both sudden onset and abrupt cessation. Its duration is usually less than 10 seconds and rarely more than 45 seconds. Consciousness is altered; the attack may also be associated with mild clonic jerking of the eyelids or extremities, with postural tone changes, autonomic phenomena, and automatisms. The occurrence of automatisms can complicate the clinical differentiation from complex partial seizures in some patients. Absence attacks begin in childhood or adolescence and may occur up to hundreds of times a day. The electroencephalogram during the seizure shows a highly characteristic $2.5-3.5 \mathrm{~Hz}$ spike-and-wave pattern. Atypical absence patients have seizures with postural changes that are more abrupt, and such patients are often mentally retarded; the electroencephalogram may show a slower spike-and-wave discharge, and the seizures may be more refractory to therapy.

Myoclonic jerking is seen, to a greater or lesser extent, in a wide variety of seizures, including generalized tonic-clonic seizures, partial seizures, absence seizures, and infantile spasms. Treatment of seizures that include myoclonic jerking should be directed at the primary seizure type rather than at the myoclonus. Some patients, however, have myoclonic jerking as the major seizure type, and some have frequent myoclonic jerking and occasional generalized tonic-clonic seizures without overt signs of neurologic deficit. Many kinds of myoclonus exist, and much effort has gone into attempts to classify this entity.

Atonic seizures are those in which the patient has sudden loss of postural tone. If standing, the patient falls suddenly to the floor and may be injured. If seated, the head and torso may suddenly drop forward. Although most often seen in children, this seizure type is not unusual in adults. Many patients with atonic seizures wear helmets to prevent head injury.

Infantile spasms are an epileptic syndrome and not a seizure type. The attacks, although sometimes fragmentary, are most often bilateral and are included for pragmatic purposes with the generalized seizures. These attacks are most often characterized clinically by brief, recurrent myoclonic jerks of the body with sudden flexion or extension of the body and limbs; the forms of infantile spasms are, however, quite heterogeneous. Ninety percent of affected patients have their first attack before the
age of 1 year. Most patients are mentally retarded, presumably from the same cause as the spasms. The cause is unknown in many patients, but such widely disparate disorders as infection, kernicterus, tuberous sclerosis, and hypoglycemia have been implicated. In some cases, the electroencephalogram is characteristic. Drugs used to treat infantile spasms are effective only in some patients; there is little evidence that the mental retardation is alleviated by therapy, even when the attacks disappear.

\section*{THERAPEUTI C STRATEGY}

For most of the older antiseizure drugs, relationships between blood levels and therapeutic effects have been characterized to a high degree. The same is true for the pharmacokinetics of these drugs. These relationships provide significant advantages in the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of epilepsy. The therapeutic index for most antiseizure drugs is low, and toxicity is not uncommon. Thus, effective treatment of seizures often requires an awareness of the therapeutic levels and pharmacokinetic properties as well as the characteristic toxicities of each agent. Measurements of antiseizure drug plasma levels can be very useful when combined with clinical observations and pharmacokinetic data (Table 24-2). The relationship between seizure control and plasma drug levels is variable and often less clear for the drugs marketed since 1990.

\section*{Management of Epilepsy}

\section*{PARTIAL SEI ZURES \& GENERALI ZED TONI C-CLONI C SEI ZURES}

Until the last 15 years, the choice of drugs for partial and tonic-clonic seizures was usually limited to phenytoin, carbamazepine, or barbiturates. There has been a strong tendency in the past few decades
to limit the use of sedative antiseizure drugs such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines to patients who cannot tolerate other medications. Thus, in the 1980s, the trend was to increase the use of carbamazepine. Although carbamazepine and phenytoin are still very widely used, all of the newer drugs (marketed after 1990) have shown effectiveness against these same seizure types. An effort has been made to define the role for these new drugs (French et al, 2004). With the older drugs, the efficacy and the long-term adverse effects are well established; this creates a "confidence level" in spite of questionable tolerability. For the newer drugs, most have a broader spectrum of activity, and most are well tolerated, but the same "confidence level" is not yet present. These issues (plus the issues of drug cost) are the determining factors in choosing a drug for these seizure types.

\section*{GENERALI ZED SEI ZURES}

The issues (described above) related to choosing between old and new drugs apply to the generalized group of seizures as well.

The drugs used for generalized tonic-clonic seizures are the same as for partial seizures; in addition, valproate is clearly useful.

At least three drugs are effective against absence seizures. Two are nonsedating and therefore preferred: ethosuximide and valproate. Clonazepam is also highly effective but has disadvantages of dose-related adverse effects and development of tolerance. Lamotrigine and topiramate may also be useful.

Specific myoclonic syndromes are usually treated with valproate; an intravenous formulation can be used acutely as needed. It is nonsedating and can be dramatically effective. Other patients respond to clonazepam, nitrazepam, or other benzodiazepines, although high doses may be necessary, with accompanying drowsiness. Zonisamide and levetiracetam may be useful. Another specific myoclonic syndrome, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, can be aggravated by phenytoin or carbamazepine; valproate is the drug of choice followed by lamotrigine and topiramate.

Atonic seizures are often refractory to all available medications, although some reports suggest that valproate may be beneficial, as may lamotrigine. Benzodiazepines have been reported to improve seizure control in some of these patients but may worsen the attacks in others. Felbamate has been demonstrated to be effective in some patients, although the drug's idiosyncratic toxicity limits its use. If the loss of tone appears to be part of another seizure type (such as absence or complex partial seizures), every effort should be made to treat the other seizure type vigorously, hoping for simultaneous alleviation of the atonic component of the seizure. The ketogenic diet may also be useful.

\section*{DRUGS USED IN INFANTI LE SPASMS}

The treatment of infantile spasms is unfortunately limited to improvement of control of the seizures rather than other features of the disorder, such as retardation. Most patients receive a course of intramuscular corticotropin, although some clinicians note that prednisone may be equally effective and can be given orally. Clinical trials have been unable to settle the matter. In either case, therapy must often be discontinued because of adverse effects. If seizures recur, repeat courses of corticotropin or corticosteroids can be given, or other drugs may be tried. Other drugs widely used are the benzodiazepines such as clonazepam or nitrazepam; their efficacy in this heterogeneous syndrome may be nearly as good as that of corticosteroids. Vigabatrin may also be effective. The mechanism of
action of corticosteroids or corticotropin in the treatment of infantile spasms is unknown. Further details may be sought in more specialized texts.

\section*{STATUS EPI LEPTI CUS}

There are many forms of status epilepticus. The most common, generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus, is a life-threatening emergency, requiring immediate cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic management as well as pharmacologic therapy. The latter virtually always requires intravenous administration of antiseizure medications. Diazepam is the most effective drug in most patients for stopping the attacks and is given directly by intravenous push to a maximum total dose of $20-30 \mathrm{mg}$ in adults. Intravenous diazepam may depress respiration (less frequently, cardiovascular function), and facilities for resuscitation must be immediately at hand during its administration. The effect of diazepam is not lasting, but the 30- to 40-minute seizure-free interval allows more definitive therapy to be initiated. Some physicians prefer lorazepam, which is equivalent to diazepam in effect and perhaps somewhat longer-acting. For patients who are not actually in the throes of a seizure, diazepam therapy can be omitted and the patient treated at once with a long-acting drug such as phenytoin.

Until the introduction of fosphenytoin, the mainstay of continuing therapy for status epilepticus was intravenous phenytoin, which is effective and nonsedating. It can be given as a loading dose of 13-18 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ in adults; the usual error is to give too little. Administration should be at a maximum rate of 50 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$. It is safest to give the drug directly by intravenous push, but it can also be diluted in saline; it precipitates rapidly in the presence of glucose. Careful monitoring of cardiac rhythm and blood pressure is necessary, especially in elderly people. At least part of the cardiotoxicity is from the propylene glycol in which the phenytoin is dissolved. Fosphenytoin, which is freely soluble in intravenous solutions without the need for propylene glycol or other solubilizing agents, is a safer parenteral agent. Because of its greater molecular weight, this prodrug is two thirds to three quarters as potent as phenytoin on a milligram basis.

In previously treated epileptic patients, the administration of a large loading dose of phenytoin may cause some dose-related toxicity such as ataxia. This is usually a relatively minor problem during the acute status episode and is easily alleviated by later adjustment of plasma levels.

For patients who do not respond to phenytoin, phenobarbital can be given in large doses: 100-200 mg intravenously to a total of $400-800 \mathrm{mg}$. Respiratory depression is a common complication, especially if benzodiazepines have already been given, and there should be no hesitation in instituting intubation and ventilation.

Although other drugs such as lidocaine have been recommended for the treatment of generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus, general anesthesia is usually necessary in highly resistant cases.

For patients in absence status, benzodiazepines are still drugs of first choice. Rarely, intravenous valproate may be required.

\section*{Special Aspects of the Toxicology of Antiseizure Drugs TERATOGENI CI TY}

The potential teratogenicity of antiseizure drugs is controversial and important. It is important because
teratogenicity resulting from long-term drug treatment of millions of people throughout the world may have a profound effect even if the effect occurs in only a small percentage of cases. It is controversial because both epilepsy and antiseizure drugs are heterogeneous, and few epileptic patients are available for study who are not receiving these drugs. Furthermore, patients with severe epilepsy, in whom genetic factors rather than drug factors may be of greater importance in the occurrence of fetal malformations, are often receiving multiple antiseizure drugs in high doses.

In spite of these limitations, it appears-from whatever cause-that children born to mothers taking antiseizure drugs have an increased risk, perhaps twofold, of congenital malformations. Phenytoin has been implicated in a specific syndrome called fetal hydantoin syndrome, although not all investigators are convinced of its existence and a similar syndrome has been attributed both to phenobarbital and to carbamazepine. Valproate, as noted above, has also been implicated in a specific malformation, spina bifida. It is estimated that a pregnant woman taking valproic acid or sodium valproate has a $1-2 \%$ risk of having a child with spina bifida. Topiramate has shown some teratogenicity in animal testing and, as noted earlier, in the human male fetus.

In dealing with the clinical problem of a pregnant woman with epilepsy, most epileptologists agree that although it is important to minimize exposure to antiseizure drugs, both in numbers and dosages, it is also important not to allow maternal seizures to go unchecked.

\section*{WI THDRAWAL}

Withdrawal of antiseizure drugs, whether by accident or by design, can cause increased seizure frequency and severity. The two factors to consider are the effects of the withdrawal itself and the need for continued drug suppression of seizures in the individual patient. In many patients, both factors must be considered. It is important to note, however, that the abrupt discontinuance of antiseizure drugs ordinarily does not cause seizures in nonepileptic patients, provided that the drug levels are not above the usual therapeutic range when the drug is stopped.

Some drugs are more easily withdrawn than others. In general, withdrawal of anti-absence drugs is easier than withdrawal of drugs needed for partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Barbiturates and benzodiazepines are the most difficult to discontinue; weeks or months may be required, with very gradual dosage decrements, to accomplish their complete outpatient removal.

Because of the heterogeneity of epilepsy, complete discontinuance of antiseizure drug administration is an especially difficult problem. If a patient is seizure-free for 3 or 4 years, a trial of gradual discontinuance is often warranted.

\section*{OVERDOSE}

Antiseizure drugs are central nervous system depressants but are rarely lethal. Very high blood levels are usually necessary before overdoses can be considered life-threatening. The most dangerous effect of antiseizure drugs after large overdoses is respiratory depression, which may be potentiated by other agents, such as alcohol. Treatment of antiseizure drug overdose is supportive; stimulants should not be used. Efforts to hasten removal of antiseizure drugs, such as alkalinization of the urine (phenytoin is a weak acid), are usually ineffective.

\section*{GENERAL ANESTHETI CS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

The physiologic state induced by general anesthetics typically includes analgesia, amnesia, loss of consciousness, inhibition of sensory and autonomic reflexes, and skeletal muscle relaxation. The extent to which any individual anesthetic agent can exert these effects varies depending on the drug, the dosage, and the clinical situation.

An ideal anesthetic drug would induce loss of consciousness smoothly and rapidly, while allowing for prompt recovery of cognitive function after its administration is discontinued. The drug would also possess a wide margin of safety and be devoid of adverse effects. No single anesthetic agent is capable of achieving all of these desirable effects without some disadvantages when used alone. The modern practice of anesthesiology most commonly involves the use of combinations of intravenous and inhaled drugs, taking advantage of their individual favorable properties while minimizing their adverse reactions.

The anesthetic technique will vary according to the proposed type of diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical intervention. For minor procedures, oral or parenteral sedatives may be used in conjunction with local anesthetics (see Chapter 26). These techniques provide profound analgesia, but with retention of the patient's ability to maintain a patent airway and to respond to verbal commands. For more extensive surgical procedures, anesthesia frequently includes preoperative benzodiazepines, induction of anesthesia with an intravenous anesthetic (eg, thiopental or propofol), and maintenance of anesthesia with a combination of inhaled (eg, volatile agents, nitrous oxide) and intravenous (eg, propofol, opioid analgesics) drugs.

\section*{TYPES OF GENERAL ANESTHESI A}

General anesthetics are usually administered by intravenous injection or by inhalation. For many years, inhalation anesthesia was used for all major procedures. Recently, intravenous anesthesia has become the more commonly used technique.

\section*{Intravenous Anesthetics}

Several drugs are administered intravenously, alone or in combination with other anesthetic drugs, to achieve an anesthetic state or to sedate patients in intensive care units (ICUs) who must be mechanically ventilated. These drugs include the following: (1) barbiturates (eg, thiopental, methohexital); (2) benzodiazepines (eg, midazolam, diazepam); (3) propofol (4) ketamine; (5) opioid analgesics (morphine, fentanyl, sufentanil, alfentanil, remifentanil); and (6) miscellaneous sedativehypnotics (eg, etomidate, dexmedetomidine). Figure 25-1 shows the structures of some commonly used intravenous anesthetics.

\section*{Inhaled Anesthetics}

The chemical structures of the currently available inhaled anesthetics are shown in Figure 25-2. The most commonly used inhaled anesthetics are isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane. These compounds are volatile liquids. Nitrous oxide, a gas at ambient temperature and pressure, continues to be an important adjuvant to the volatile agents.

\section*{Balanced Anesthesia}

Although general anesthesia can be produced using only intravenous or only inhaled anesthetic drugs, modern anesthesia typically involves a combination of intravenous (eg, for induction of anesthesia) and inhaled (eg, for maintenance of anesthesia) drugs. Muscle relaxants are commonly used to facilitate tracheal intubation and optimize surgical conditions (see Chapter 27). Local anesthetics are often administered by tissue infiltration and peripheral nerve blocks to provide perioperative analgesia (see Chapter 26). In addition, potent opioid analgesics and cardiovascular drugs (eg, Bblockers, $\alpha_{2}$
agonists, calcium channel blockers) are used to control autonomic responses to noxious (painful) surgical stimuli.

\section*{STAGES OF ANESTHESI A}

The traditional description of the stages of anesthesia (the so-called Guedel's signs) were derived from observations of the effects of diethyl ether, which has a slow onset of central action owing to its high solubility in blood. Using these signs, anesthetic drug effects can be divided into four stages of increasing depth of central nervous system depression:
I. Stage of analgesia: The patient initially experiences analgesia without amnesia. Later in Stage I, both analgesia and amnesia are produced.
II. Stage of excitement: During this stage, the patient often appears to be delirious and may vocalize but is definitely amnesic. Respiration is irregular both in volume and rate, and retching and vomiting may occur if the patient is stimulated. For these reasons, efforts are made to limit the duration and severity of this stage, which ends with the reestablishment of regular breathing.
III. Stage of surgical anesthesia: This stage begins with the recurrence of regular respiration and extends to complete cessation of spontaneous respiration (apnea). Four planes of stage III have been described in terms of changes in ocular movements, eye reflexes, and pupil size, which under specified conditions may represent signs of increasing depth of anesthesia.
IV. Stage of medullary depression: This deep stage of anesthesia includes severe depression of the vasomotor center in the medulla, as well as the respiratory center. Without circulatory and respiratory support, death rapidly ensues.

In current anesthesia practice, the distinctive signs of each of the four stages described above are usually obscured because of the more rapid onset of action of modern intravenous and inhaled anesthetics (compared with ether), and the fact that ventilation is often controlled mechanically. In addition, the practice of administering other pharmacologic agents preoperatively (eg, preanesthetic medication) or intraoperatively (eg, opioid analgesics, cardiovascular drugs) can also alter the clinical signs of anesthesia. The anticholinergic drugs, atropine and glycopyrrolate, are used to decrease secretions and to treat bradycardia; however, they also dilate the pupils. Muscle relaxants reduce muscle tone and prevent purposeful movements, whereas the opioid analgesics exert depressant effects on both the respiratory and heart rates. The most reliable indication that stage III (surgical anesthesia) has been achieved is loss of responsiveness to noxious stimuli (eg, trapezius muscle squeeze) and reestablishment of a regular respiratory pattern. The adequacy of the depth of anesthesia for a specific surgical stimulus is assessed by monitoring changes in respiratory and cardiovascular responses to the surgical stimulation, as well as electroencephalographic (EEG-based) cerebral indices.

Although vital sign monitoring remains the most common method of assessing depth of anesthesia during surgery, techniques involving computer-assisted monitoring of cerebral function using EEG activity appear to offer some advantages. Automated techniques use processed variables derived from established effects of anesthetics on EEG activity and include the bispectral index (BIS), the physical state index (PSI), and the cerebral state index (CSI). The application of cerebral monitoring techniques has been shown to reduce the anesthetic requirement, contributing to a more rapid recovery from
general anesthesia.

\section*{I NHALED ANESTHETI CS PHARMACOKI NETI CS}

Ensuring an adequate depth of anesthesia depends on achieving a therapeutic concentration of the anesthetic in the central nervous system. The rate at which an effective brain concentration is achieved (ie, time to induction of general anesthesia) depends on multiple pharmacokinetic factors that influence the brain uptake and tissue distribution of the anesthetic agent. The pharmacokinetic properties of the intravenous anesthetics (Table 25-1) and the physicochemical properties of the inhaled agents (Table 25-2) directly influence the pharmacodynamic effects of these drugs. These factors also influence the rate of recovery when the anesthetic is discontinued.

\section*{Uptake \& Distribution of I nhaled Anesthetics}

The concentration of an inhaled anesthetic in a mixture of gases is proportional to its partial pressure (or tension). These terms are often used interchangeably in discussing the various transfer processes
involving anesthetic gases in the body. Achievement of a brain concentration of an inhaled anesthetic to provide adequate anesthesia requires transfer of the anesthetic from the alveolar air to the blood and from the blood to the brain. The rate at which a therapeutic concentration of the anesthetic is achieved in the brain depends on the solubility properties of the anesthetic, its concentration in the inspired air, the volume of pulmonary ventilation, the pulmonary blood flow, and the partial pressure gradient between arterial and mixed venous blood anesthetic concentrations.

\section*{SOLUBI LITY}

One of the most important factors influencing the transfer of an anesthetic from the lungs to the arterial blood is its solubility characteristics (Table 25-2). The blood: gas partition coefficient is a useful index of solubility and defines the relative affinity of an anesthetic for the blood compared with that of inspired gas. The partition coefficients for desflurane and nitrous oxide, which are relatively insoluble in blood, are extremely low. When an anesthetic with low blood solubility diffuses from the lung into the arterial blood, relatively few molecules are required to raise its partial pressure, and therefore the arterial tension rises rapidly (Figure 25-3, top, nitrous oxide). Conversely, for anesthetics with moderate-to-high solubility (eg, halothane, isoflurane), more molecules dissolve before partial pressure changes significantly, and arterial tension of the gas increases less rapidly (Figure 25-3, bottom, halothane). This inverse relationship between the blood solubility of an anesthetic and the rate of rise of its tension in arterial blood is illustrated in Figure 25-4. Nitrous oxide, with low solubility in blood, reaches high arterial tensions rapidly, which in turn results in rapid equilibration with the brain and fast onset of action. A rapid onset of anesthetic action is also characteristic of desflurane and, to a lesser extent, sevoflurane, volatile anesthetics that have low blood: gas partition coefficients.

Why induction of anesthesia is slower with more soluble anesthetic gases. In this schematic diagram, solubility in blood is represented by the relative size of the blood compartment (the more soluble, the larger the compartment). Relative partial pressures of the agents in the compartments are indicated by the degree of filling
of each compartment. For a given concentration or partial pressure of the two anesthetic gases in the inspired air, it will take much longer for the blood partial pressure of the more soluble gas (halothane) to rise to the same partial pressure as in the alveoli. Since the concentration of the anesthetic agent in the brain can rise no faster than the concentration in the blood, the onset of anesthesia will be slower with halothane than with nitrous oxide.

Tensions of three anesthetic gases in arterial blood as a function of time after beginning inhalation. Nitrous oxide is relatively insoluble (blood: gas partition coefficient $=0.47$ ); methoxyflurane is much more soluble (coefficient $=$ 12); and halothane is intermediate (2.3).

ANESTHETIC CONCENTRATION IN THE INSPIRED AIR
The concentration of an inhaled anesthetic in the inspired gas mixture has direct effects on both the maximum tension that can be achieved in the alveoli and the rate of increase in its tension in arterial blood. Increases in the inspired anesthetic concentration increase the rate of induction of anesthesia by increasing the rate of transfer into the blood according to Fick's law (see Chapter 1). Advantage is taken of this effect in anesthetic practice with inhaled anesthetics that possess moderate blood solubility (eg, enflurane, isoflurane, and halothane). For example, a $1.5 \%$ concentration of isoflurane may be administered initially to increase the rate of induction; this is reduced to $0.75-1 \%$ for maintenance when adequate anesthesia is achieved. In addition, moderately soluble anesthetics are often administered in combination with a less soluble agent (eg, nitrous oxide) to reduce the time required for loss of consciousness and achievement of a surgical depth of anesthesia.

\section*{PULMONARY VENTILATION}

The rate of rise of anesthetic gas tension in arterial blood is directly dependent on both the rate and depth of ventilation (ie, minute ventilation). The magnitude of the effect varies according to the blood: gas partition coefficient. An increase in pulmonary ventilation is accompanied by only a slight increase in arterial tension of an anesthetic with low blood solubility or low coefficient but can significantly increase tension of agents with moderate-to-high blood solubility (Figure 25-5). For example, a fourfold increase in ventilation rate almost doubles the arterial tension of halothane during the first 10 minutes of anesthesia but increases the arterial tension of nitrous oxide by only $15 \%$. Therefore, hyperventilation increases the speed of induction of anesthesia with inhaled anesthetics that would normally have a slow onset. Depression of respiration by opioid analgesics slows the onset of anesthesia of inhaled anesthetics if ventilation is not manually or mechanically assisted.

Ventilation rate and arterial anesthetic tensions. Increased ventilation (8 versus $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ ) has a much greater effect on equilibration of halothane than nitrous oxide.

\section*{PULMONARY BLOOD FLOW}

Changes in blood flow to and from the lungs influence transfer processes of the anesthetic gases. An increase in pulmonary blood flow (ie, increased cardiac output) slows the rate of rise in arterial tension, particularly for those anesthetics with moderate-to-high blood solubility. Increased pulmonary blood flow exposes a larger volume of blood to the anesthetic; thus, blood "capacity" increases and the anesthetic tension rises slowly. A decrease in pulmonary blood flow has the opposite effect, increasing the rate of rise of arterial tension of inhaled anesthetics. In patients with circulatory shock, the combined effects of decreased cardiac output (resulting in decreased pulmonary flow) and increased
ventilation will accelerate induction of anesthesia with halothane and isoflurane. However, this is not likely to occur with less soluble agents such as nitrous oxide and desflurane.

\section*{ARTERIOVENOUS CONCENTRATION GRADIENT}

The anesthetic concentration gradient between arterial and mixed venous blood is dependent mainly on uptake of the anesthetic by the tissues, including nonneural tissues. Depending on the rate and extent of tissue uptake, venous blood returning to the lungs may contain significantly less anesthetic than arterial blood. The greater this difference in anesthetic gas tensions, the more time it will take to achieve equilibrium with brain tissue. Anesthetic entry into tissues is influenced by factors similar to those that determine transfer from lung to blood, including tissue: blood partition coefficients, rates of blood flow to the tissues, and concentration gradients.

During the induction phase of anesthesia, the tissues that exert greatest influence on the arteriovenous anesthetic concentration gradient are those which are highly perfused (eg, brain, heart, liver, kidneys, and splanchnic bed). These tissues receive over $75 \%$ of the resting cardiac output. In the case of anesthetics with relatively high solubility in highly perfused tissues, venous blood concentration will initially be very low, and equilibrium with arterial blood is achieved slowly.

During maintenance of anesthesia with inhaled anesthetics, the drug continues to be transferred between various tissues at rates dependent on solubility and blood flow. Although muscle and skin constitute $50 \%$ of the total body mass, anesthetics accumulate more slowly in them than in highly perfused tissues (eg, brain) because they receive only one-fifth of the resting cardiac output. Although most anesthetic gases are highly soluble in adipose tissues, low blood perfusion to these tissues delays accumulation, and equilibrium is unlikely to occur with most anesthetics during an operation.

\section*{Elimination}

The time to recovery from inhalation anesthesia depends on the rate of elimination of anesthetics from the brain. Many of the processes of anesthetic transfer during recovery are simply the reverse of those that occur during induction of anesthesia. One of the most important factors governing rate of recovery is the blood: gas partition coefficient of the anesthetic agent. Other factors controlling rate of recovery include the pulmonary blood flow, the magnitude of ventilation, and the tissue solubility of the anesthetic. Two features of recovery, however, are different from what happens during induction of anesthesia. First, although transfer of an anesthetic from the lungs to blood can be enhanced by increasing its concentration in inspired air, the reverse transfer process cannot be enhanced, because the concentration in the lungs cannot be reduced below zero. Second, at the beginning of recovery, the anesthetic gas tension in different tissues may be quite variable, depending on the specific agent and the duration of anesthesia. In contrast, with induction of anesthesia the initial anesthetic tension is zero in all tissues.

Inhaled anesthetics that are relatively insoluble in blood (ie, low blood: gas partition coefficient) and brain are eliminated at faster rates than more soluble anesthetics. The washout of nitrous oxide, desflurane, and sevoflurane occurs at a rapid rate, which leads to a more rapid recovery from their anesthetic effects compared with halothane and isoflurane. Halothane is approximately twice as soluble in brain tissue and five times more soluble in blood than nitrous oxide and desflurane; its elimination therefore takes place more slowly, and recovery from halothane anesthesia is predictably less rapid.

The duration of exposure to the anesthetic can also have a marked effect on recovery time, especially
in the case of more soluble anesthetics (eg, isoflurane). Accumulation of anesthetics in muscle, skin, and fat increases with prolonged inhalation (especially in obese patients), and blood tension may decline slowly during recovery as the anesthetic is gradually eliminated from these tissues. Thus, if exposure to the anesthetic is short, recovery may be rapid even with the more soluble agents. However, after prolonged administration, recovery can be delayed even with anesthetics of moderate solubility (eg, isoflurane).

Clearance of inhaled anesthetics via the lungs is the major route of elimination from the body. However, hepatic metabolism may also contribute to the elimination of some volatile anesthetics. For example, the elimination of halothane during recovery is more rapid than that of enflurane, which would not be predicted from their respective tissue solubilities. However, over $40 \%$ of inspired halothane is metabolized during an average anesthetic procedure, whereas less than $10 \%$ of enflurane is metabolized over the same period. Oxidative metabolism of halothane results in the formation of trifluoroacetic acid and release of bromide and chloride ions. Under conditions of low oxygen tension, halothane is metabolized to the chlorotrifluoroethyl free radical, which is capable of reacting with hepatic membrane components and on rare occasions producing halothane hepatitis. Isoflurane and desflurane are the least metabolized of the fluorinated anesthetics; only traces of trifluoroacetic acid appear in the urine even after prolonged administration.

The metabolism of enflurane and sevoflurane results in the formation of fluoride ion; however, in contrast to the rarely used volatile anesthetic methoxyflurane, renal fluoride levels do not reach toxic levels under normal circumstances. In addition, sevoflurane is degraded by contact with the carbon dioxide absorbent in anesthesia machines, yielding a vinyl ether called "compound A," which can cause renal damage if high concentrations are absorbed. (See Do We Need Another Inhaled Anesthetic?) Seventy percent of the absorbed methoxyflurane is metabolized by the liver, and released fluoride ions can very readily produce nephrotoxicity. In terms of the extent of hepatic metabolism, the rank order for the inhaled anesthetics is methoxyflurane > halothane > enflurane > sevoflurane $>$ isoflurane > desflurane > nitrous oxide (Table 25-2). Nitrous oxide is not metabolized by human tissues. However, bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract may be able to break down the nitrous oxide molecule.

\section*{DO WE NEED ANOTHER INHALED ANESTHETIC?}

After its introduction in 1956, halothane was the standard of comparison for inhaled anesthetics. However, the onset and recovery from its anesthetic action were slow compared with the commonly used intravenous agents (eg, thiopental). In addition, its hepatic metabolism can result in a reactive compound that may lead to halothane-associated hepatitis.

The newer volatile anesthetics, desflurane and sevoflurane, have physicochemical characteristics (ie, low blood: gas partition coefficients) that are favorable to a more rapid onset and shorter duration of anesthetic actions compared with isoflurane and halothane. However, both of these newer agents also have certain limitations. The low volatility of desflurane necessitates the use of a specialized heated vaporizer, and the pungency of the drug leads to a high incidence of coughing and sympathomimetic side effects that make it less than ideally suited for induction of anesthesia.

Anesthesia is achieved rapidly and smoothly with sevoflurane, and recovery is more rapid than with isoflurane. However, sevoflurane is chemically unstable when exposed to carbon dioxide
absorbents in anesthesia machines, degrading to an olefinic compound (fluoromethyl-2,2-difluoro-1-[trifluoromethyl]vinyl ether, also known as compound A) that is potentially nephrotoxic. In addition, sevoflurane is metabolized by the liver to release fluoride ions, raising concerns about potential renal damage.

Sevoflurane comes close to having the characteristics of an ideal inhaled anesthetic; however, a more insoluble compound that lacks the pungency of desflurane and has greater chemical stability than sevoflurane could be a useful alternative to the currently available inhaled agents.

\section*{PHARMACODYNAMI CS}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Both the inhaled and the intravenous anesthetics can depress spontaneous and evoked activity of neurons in many regions of the brain. Older concepts of the mechanism of anesthesia evoked nonspecific interactions of these agents with the lipid matrix of the nerve membrane (the MeyerOverton principle)-interactions that were thought to lead to secondary changes in ion flux. More recently, evidence has accumulated suggesting that the modification of ion currents by anesthetics results from more direct interactions with specific nerve membrane components. The ionic mechanisms involved for different anesthetics may vary, but at clinically relevant concentrations they appear to involve interactions with members of the ligand-gated ion channel family.

In the past decade, considerable evidence has accumulated that a primary molecular target of general anesthetics is the $\mathbf{G A B A}_{\mathbf{A}}$ receptor-chloride channel, a major mediator of inhibitory synaptic transmission. Inhaled anesthetics, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, etomidate, and propofol facilitate GABA-mediated inhibition at GABA ${ }_{A}$ receptor sites. These receptors are sensitive to clinically relevant concentrations of the anesthetic agents and exhibit the appropriate stereospecific effects in the case of enantiomeric drugs. The GABA receptor-chloride channel is a pentameric assembly of five proteins derived from several polypeptide subclasses (see Chapter 22). Combinations of three major subunits$a, b$, and $\gamma$-are necessary for normal physiologic and pharmacologic functions. GABA receptors in different areas of the central nervous system contain different subunit combinations, conferring different pharmacologic properties on each receptor subtype. Both inhaled and intravenous anesthetics with sedative-hypnotic properties directly activate GABA $_{\text {A }}$ receptors, but at low concentrations they can also facilitate the action of GABA to increase chloride ion flux. In contrast, sedative benzodiazepines that lack general anesthetic properties (eg, diazepam, lorazepam) facilitate GABA action but have no direct actions on $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptors even at high concentrations in the absence of GABA.

Reconstitution studies with transfected cells utilizing chimeric and mutated GABA receptors reveal that anesthetic molecules do not interact directly with the GABA binding site but with specific sites in the transmembrane domains of both a band bsubunits. Two specific amino acid residues in transmembrane segments 2 and 3 of the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor $\mathrm{a}_{2}$ subunit, Ser270 and Ala291, are critical for the enhancement of $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor function by inhaled anesthetics. One consequence of the interaction of isoflurane with this domain is an alteration in the gating of the chloride ion channel. However, differences occur in the precise binding sites of individual anesthetics. For example, a specific aspartate residue within transmembrane segment 2 of the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor $\mathrm{C}_{2}$ subunit is required for etomidate activity but is not essential for the activity of barbiturates or propofol.

Ketamine does not produce its effects via facilitation of $G A B A_{A}$ receptor functions, but it may function via antagonism of the action of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamic acid on the N-methyl-daspartate (NMDA) receptor. This receptor may also be a target for nitrous oxide.

In addition to their action on $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ chloride channels, certain general anesthetics have been reported to cause membrane hyperpolarization (ie, an inhibitory action) via their activation of potassium channels. These channels are ubiquitous in the central nervous system and some are linked to neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Electrophysiologic analyses of membrane ion flux in cultured cells have shown that inhaled anesthetics decrease the duration of opening of nicotinic receptor-activated cation channels-an action that decreases the excitatory effects of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. Most inhaled anesthetics inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine receptor isoforms, particularly those containing the $a_{4}$ subunit, though such actions do not appear to be involved in their immobilizing actions. The strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor is another ligand-gated ion channel that may function as a target for inhaled anesthetics, which can elicit channel opening directly and independently of their facilitatory effects on neurotransmitter binding.

The neuropharmacologic basis for the effects that characterize the stages of anesthesia appears to be differential sensitivity of specific neurons or neuronal pathways to the anesthetic drugs. Neurons in the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord are very sensitive to relatively low anesthetic concentrations. Interaction with neurons in this region interrupts sensory transmission in the spinothalamic tract, including transmission of nociceptive (pain) stimuli. These effects contribute to stage I analgesia and conscious sedation. The disinhibitory effects of general anesthetics (stage II), which occur at higher brain concentrations, result from complex neuronal actions, including blockade of many small inhibitory neurons such as Golgi type II cells, together with a paradoxical facilitation of excitatory neurotransmitters. A progressive depression of ascending pathways in the reticular activating system occurs during stage III of anesthesia; also occurring is suppression of spinal reflex activity, which contributes to muscle relaxation. Neurons in the respiratory and vasomotor centers of the medulla are relatively insensitive to the effects of general anesthetics, but at high concentrations their activity is depressed, leading to cardiorespiratory collapse (stage IV). It remains to be determined whether regional variation in anesthetic actions corresponds to the regional variation in the subtypes of GABA receptors. The differential sensitivity of specific neurons or neuronal pathways to anesthetics could reflect their interactions with other molecules in the fast ligand-gated ion channel family or could represent the existence of other molecular targets that have yet to be characterized.

\section*{Dose-Response Characteristics: The Concept of Minimum Alveolar Anesthetic Concentration}

Inhaled anesthetics are delivered to the lungs in gas mixtures in which concentrations and flow rates are easy to measure and control. However, dose-response characteristics of gaseous anesthetics are difficult to measure. Although achievement of an anesthetic state depends on the concentration of the anesthetic in the brain (ie, effect site), concentrations in the brain tissue are obviously impossible to measure under clinical conditions. Furthermore, neither the lower nor the upper ends of the graded dose-response curve defining the effect on the central nervous system can be ethically determined because at very low gas concentrations awareness of pain may occur. Moreover, at high concentrations there is a high risk of severe cardiovascular and respiratory depression. Nevertheless, a useful
estimate of anesthetic potency can be obtained using quantal dose-response principles.
During general anesthesia, the partial pressure of an inhaled anesthetic in the brain equals that in the lung when steady state is reached. Therefore, at a given level of anesthesia, measurements of the steady-state alveolar concentrations of different anesthetics provide a comparison of their relative potencies. The volatile anesthetic concentration is the percentage of the alveolar gas mixture, or partial pressure of the anesthetic as a percentage of 760 mm Hg (atmospheric pressure at sea level). The minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC) is defined as the median concentration that results in immobility in $50 \%$ of patients when exposed to a noxious stimulus (eg, surgical incision). Therefore, the MAC represents one point (the ED50) on a conventional quantal dose-response curve (see Figure 2-16). Table 25-2 shows MAC values of the inhaled anesthetics, permitting comparison of their relative anesthetic potencies. The MAC value greater than $100 \%$ for nitrous oxide demonstrates that it is the least potent inhaled anesthetic. At normal barometric pressure, even 760 mm Hg partial pressure of nitrous oxide (100\% of the inspired gas) is still less than 1 MAC , so it must be supplemented with other agents to achieve full surgical anesthesia (see below).

The dose of anesthetic gas that is being administered can be stated in multiples of MAC. A dose of 1 MAC of any anesthetic prevents movement in response to surgical incision in 50\% of patients; however, individual patients may require $0.5-1.5 \mathrm{MAC}$. Unfortunately, MAC gives no information about the slope of the dose-response curve. In general, however, the dose-response relationship for inhaled anesthetics is very steep. Therefore, over $95 \%$ of patients may fail to respond to a noxious stimulus at 1.1 MAC.

The measurement of MAC values under controlled conditions has permitted quantitation of the effects of a number of variables on anesthetic requirements. For example, MAC values decrease in elderly patients and with hypothermia, but are not affected greatly by sex, height, and weight. Of particular importance is the presence of adjuvant drugs, which can change anesthetic requirement significantly. When intravenous drugs (eg, opioid analgesics, sympatholytics, or sedative-hypnotics) are administered as adjuvants to the volatile anesthetics, MAC is decreased in a dose-related fashion. The inspired concentration of anesthetic should be decreased in these situations.

MAC values of the inhaled anesthetics are additive. For example, nitrous oxide (60-70\%) can be used as a "carrier" gas producing 40\% of a MAC, thereby decreasing the anesthetic requirement of inhaled volatile and intravenous anesthetics. The addition of nitrous oxide ( $60 \%$ tension, $40 \% \mathrm{MAC}$ ) to $70 \%$ of a volatile agent's MAC would yield a total of $110 \%$ of a MAC, a value sufficient for surgical anesthesia in most patients.

\section*{Organ System Effects of Inhaled Anesthetics}

\section*{EFFECTS ON THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM}

Halothane, desflurane, enflurane, sevoflurane, and isoflurane all decrease mean arterial pressure in direct proportion to their alveolar concentration. With halothane and enflurane, the reduced arterial pressure appears to be caused by a reduction in cardiac output because there is little change in systemic vascular resistance despite marked changes in individual vascular beds (eg, an increase in cerebral blood flow). In contrast, isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane have a depressant effect on arterial pressure as a result of a decrease in systemic vascular resistance with minimal effect on cardiac output.

Inhaled anesthetics change heart rate either directly by altering the rate of sinus node depolarization or indirectly by shifting the balance of autonomic nervous system activity. Bradycardia can be seen with halothane, probably because of direct vagal stimulation. In contrast, enflurane, and sevoflurane have little effect, and both desflurane and isoflurane increase heart rate. In the case of desflurane, transient sympathetic activation with elevations in catecholamine levels can lead to marked increases in heart rate and blood pressure when high inspired gas concentrations are administered.

All inhaled anesthetics tend to increase right atrial pressure in a dose-related fashion, which reflects depression of myocardial function. In general, enflurane and halothane have greater myocardial depressant effects than isoflurane and the newer, less soluble halogenated anesthetics. Inhaled anesthetics reduce myocardial oxygen consumption, primarily by decreasing the variables that control oxygen demand, such as arterial blood pressure and contractile force (see Chapter 12). Although it produces less depression than the volatile anesthetics, nitrous oxide has also been found to depress the myocardium in a dose-dependent manner. However, administration of nitrous oxide in combination with the more potent inhaled (volatile) anesthetics can minimize cardiac depressant effects owing to its anesthetic-sparing effect.

Several factors influence the cardiovascular effects of inhaled anesthetics. Surgical stimulation, intravascular volume status, ventilatory status, and duration of anesthesia alter the cardiovascular depressant effects of these drugs. Hypercapnia releases catecholamines, which attenuate the decrease in blood pressure. As a result, the blood pressure decrease after 5 hours of anesthesia is less than it is after 1 hour; however, concomitant use of Bblockers reduces this adaptive effect. Halothane and, to a lesser extent, isoflurane sensitize the myocardium to circulating catecholamines. Ventricular arrhythmias may occur in patients with cardiac disease who are given sympathomimetic drugs or have high circulating levels of endogenous catecholamines (eg, anxious patients, those given epinephrinecontaining local anesthetics, and those with pheochromocytoma). However, the less soluble inhaled anesthetics appear to be less arrhythmogenic.

\section*{EFFECTS ON THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM}

With the exception of nitrous oxide, all inhaled anesthetics in current use cause a dose-dependent decrease in tidal volume and an increase in respiratory rate. However, the increase in rate is insufficient to compensate for the decrease in volume, resulting in a decrease in minute ventilation. All volatile anesthetics are respiratory depressants, as indicated by a reduced response to increased levels of carbon dioxide. The degree of ventilatory depression varies among the volatile agents, with isoflurane and enflurane being the most depressant. All volatile anesthetics in current use increase the resting level of $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ (the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood).

Volatile anesthetics increase the apneic threshold (Paco2 level below which apnea occurs through lack of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-driven respiratory stimulation) and decrease the ventilatory response to hypoxia. The latter effect is especially important because subanesthetic concentrations during the early recovery period can depress the normal compensatory increase in ventilation that occurs during hypoxic states. The respiratory depressant effects of anesthetics are overcome by assisting (or controlling) ventilation mechanically. Furthermore, the ventilatory depressant effects of inhaled anesthetics are counteracted by surgical stimulation.

Inhaled anesthetics also depress mucociliary function in the airway. Thus, prolonged anesthesia may lead to pooling of mucus and then result in atelectasis and postoperative respiratory infections.

However, volatile anesthetics possess varying degrees of bronchodilating properties), an effect of value in the treatment of active wheezing and status asthmaticus. The bronchodilating action of halothane and sevoflurane makes them the induction agents of choice in patients with underlying airway problems (eg, asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Airway irritation, which may provoke coughing or breath-holding, is rarely a problem with halothane and sevoflurane. However, the pungency of desflurane make this agent less suitable for induction of anesthesia despite its low blood: gas partition coefficient.

\section*{EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN}

Inhaled anesthetics decrease the metabolic rate of the brain. Nevertheless, the more soluble volatile agents increase cerebral blood flow because they decrease cerebral vascular resistance. The increase in cerebral blood flow is clinically undesirable in patients who have increased intracranial pressure because of a brain tumor or head injury. Volatile anesthetic-induced increases in cerebral blood flow increase cerebral blood volume and further increase intracranial pressure.

Of the inhaled anesthetics, nitrous oxide is the least likely to increase cerebral blood flow. At low concentrations, all of the halogenated agents have similar effects on cerebral blood flow. However, at higher concentrations, the increase in cerebral blood flow is less with the more insoluble agents such as desflurane and sevoflurane. If the patient is hyperventilated before the volatile agent is started, the increase in intracranial pressure can be minimized.

Halothane, isoflurane, and enflurane have similar depressant effects on the EEG up to doses of 1-1.5 MAC. At higher doses, the cerebral irritant effects of enflurane may lead to development of a spike-and-wave pattern and mild generalized muscle twitching (ie, myoclonic activity). However, this seizure-like activity has not been found to have any adverse clinical consequences. Seizure-like EEG activity has also been described after sevoflurane, but not desflurane. Although nitrous oxide has a very low anesthetic potency, it does possess both analgesic and amnesic properties when used alone or in combination with other agents as part of a balanced anesthesia technique.

\section*{EFFECTS ON THE KIDNEY}

Depending on the concentration, volatile anesthetics decrease the glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow, and increase the filtration fraction. Since renal blood flow decreases during general anesthesia in spite of well-maintained or even increased perfusion pressures (due to increased renal vascular resistance), autoregulation of renal flow may be impaired.

\section*{EFFECTS ON THE LIVER}

Volatile anesthetics cause a concentration-dependent decrease in hepatic blood flow ranging from 15\% to $45 \%$ below the preinduction (baseline) value. Despite transient intraoperative changes in liver function tests, permanent changes in liver enzyme function are rare.

\section*{EFFECTS ON UTERINE SMOOTH MUSCLE}

Nitrous oxide appears to have little effect on uterine musculature. However, the halogenated anesthetics are potent uterine muscle relaxants and produce this effect in a concentration-dependent fashion. This pharmacologic effect can be used to advantage when profound uterine relaxation is required for an intrauterine fetal manipulation or manual extraction of a retained placenta during delivery.

\section*{Toxicity}

\section*{HEPATOTOXICITY (HALOTHANE)}

Postoperative hepatic dysfunction is typically associated with factors such as blood transfusions, hypovolemic shock, and other surgical stresses rather than volatile anesthetic toxicity. However, a small subset of individuals who have been previously exposed to halothane may develop potentially life-threatening hepatitis. The incidence of severe hepatotoxicity following exposure to halothane is in the range of one in 20,000-35,000. Obese patients who have had more than one exposure to halothane during a short time interval may be the most susceptible. There is no specific treatment for halothane hepatitis, and therefore liver transplantation may ultimately be required.

The mechanisms underlying hepatotoxicity from halothane remain unclear, but studies in animals have implicated the formation of reactive metabolites that either cause direct hepatocellular damage (eg, free radicals) or initiate immune-mediated responses. With regard to the latter mechanism, serum from patients with halothane hepatitis contains a variety of autoantibodies against hepatic proteins. Trifluoroacetylated (TFA) proteins in the liver could be formed in the hepatocyte during the biotransformation of halothane by liver drug-metabolizing enzymes. It is interesting that TFA proteins have also been identified in the sera of patients who did not develop hepatitis after halothane anesthesia.

\section*{NEPHROTOXI CITY}

Metabolism of methoxyflurane, enflurane, and sevoflurane leads to the formation of fluoride ions, and this has raised questions concerning the nephrotoxicity of these three volatile anesthetics. Changes in renal concentrating ability have been observed with prolonged exposure to both methoxyflurane and enflurane but not sevoflurane. Differences between the agents may be related to the fact that methoxyflurane and enflurane (but not sevoflurane) are metabolized in part by renal enzymes (eg, Blyase), generating fluoride ions intrarenally. Sevoflurane degradation by carbon dioxide absorbents in anesthesia machines leads to formation of a haloalkene, compound $A$, which is metabolized by renal $B$ lyase to form thioacylhalide and causes a proximal tubular necrosis when administered to rats. However, there have been no reports of renal injury in humans receiving sevoflurane anesthesia. Moreover, the anesthetic does not appear to change standard markers of renal function. Renal dysfunction following methoxyflurane is caused by inorganic fluoride released during the extensive metabolism of this anesthetic by hepatic and renal enzymes. As a result, methoxyflurane, though still available, is no longer used in clinical practice.

\section*{MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA}

Malignant hyperthermia is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder of skeletal muscle that occurs in susceptible individuals undergoing general anesthesia with volatile agents and muscle relaxants (eg, succinylcholine). The malignant hyperthermia syndrome consists of the rapid onset of tachycardia and hypertension, severe muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, hyperkalemia, and acid-base imbalance with acidosis that follows exposure to a triggering agent (see Table 16-4). Malignant hyperthermia is a rare but important cause of anesthetic morbidity and mortality. The specific biochemical abnormality is an increase in free calcium concentration in skeletal muscle cells. Treatment includes administration of dantrolene (to reduce calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum) and appropriate measures to reduce body temperature and restore electrolyte and acid-base balance.

Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility is characterized by genetic heterogeneity, and several predisposing clinical myopathies have been identified. It has been associated with mutations in the
gene loci corresponding to the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyRI), the calcium release channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in the RyR1 gene are inherited as mendelian dominant characteristics. Other chromosomal loci for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility include mutant alleles of the gene encoding the $\alpha_{1}$ subunit of the human skeletal muscle dihydropyridine-sensitive Ltype voltage-dependent calcium channel. However, the genetic loci identified to date account for no more than $50 \%$ of malignant hyperthermia-susceptible individuals. Given the degree of genetic heterogeneity, it is premature to use genetic testing methods for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. Currently, the most reliable test to establish such susceptibility is the in vitro caffeinehalothane contracture test using skeletal muscle biopsy tissue.

\section*{CHRONIC TOXICITY}

\section*{Mutagenicity}

Under normal conditions, inhaled anesthetics (including nitrous oxide) are neither mutagens nor carcinogens in patients.

\section*{Carcinogenicity}

Epidemiologic studies suggested an increase in the cancer rate in operating room personnel who were exposed to trace concentrations of anesthetic agents. However, no study has demonstrated the existence of a causal relationship between anesthetics and cancer. Many other factors might account for the questionably positive results seen after a careful review of epidemiologic data. Most operating rooms now use scavenging systems to remove trace concentrations of anesthetics released from anesthetic machines.

\section*{Effects on Reproductive Organs}

The most consistent finding reported in surveys conducted to determine the reproductive success of female operating room personnel has been a questionably higher than expected incidence of miscarriages. However, there are several problems in interpreting these studies.

The association of obstetrical problems with surgery and anesthesia in pregnant patients is also an important consideration. In the USA, at least 50,000 pregnant women each year undergo anesthesia and surgery for indications unrelated to pregnancy. The risk of abortion is clearly higher following this experience. It is not obvious, however, whether the underlying disease, surgery, anesthesia, or a combination of these factors is the cause of the increased risk.

\section*{Hematotoxicity}

Prolonged exposure to nitrous oxide decreases methionine synthase activity and theoretically can cause megaloblastic anemia, a potential occupational hazard for staff working in inadequately ventilated dental operating suites.

\section*{Clinical Use of Inhaled Anesthetics}

Volatile anesthetics are rarely used as the sole agents for both induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Most commonly, they are combined with intravenous agents as part of a balanced anesthesia technique. Of the inhaled anesthetics, nitrous oxide, desflurane, sevoflurane, and isoflurane are the most commonly used in the USA. Use of less soluble volatile anesthetics (especially desflurane and sevoflurane) has increased during the last decade as more surgical procedures are performed on an ambulatory ("short-stay") basis. The low blood: gas coefficients of desflurane and sevoflurane afford a more rapid recovery and fewer postoperative adverse effects than halothane, enflurane, and
isoflurane. Although halothane is still used in pediatric anesthesia, sevoflurane is rapidly replacing halothane in this setting. As indicated previously, nitrous oxide lacks sufficient potency to produce surgical anesthesia by itself and therefore is used with volatile or intravenous anesthetics to produce a state of balanced general anesthesia. Despite the obvious advantages of the less soluble inhaled anesthetics, there is reason to believe that better ones might be developed (see Do We Need Another Inhaled Anesthetic?).

\section*{I NTRAVENOUS ANESTHETI CS}

In the last two decades there has been increasing use of intravenous anesthetics in anesthesia, both as adjuncts to inhaled anesthetics and as part of techniques that do not include any inhaled anesthetics (eg, total intravenous anesthesia). The properties of some of the commonly used intravenous anesthetics are summarized in Table 25-1. Unlike inhaled anesthetics, intravenous agents do not require specialized vaporizer equipment for their delivery or facilities for the disposal of exhaled gases. Intravenous drugs such as thiopental, methohexital, etomidate, ketamine, and propofol have an onset of anesthetic action faster than the most rapid inhaled agents (eg, desflurane and sevoflurane). Therefore, intravenous agents are commonly used for induction of general anesthesia.

Recovery is sufficiently rapid with most intravenous drugs to permit their use for short ambulatory (outpatient) surgical procedures. In the case of propofol, recovery times are similar to those seen with sevoflurane and desflurane. The anesthetic potency of intravenous anesthetics is adequate to permit their use as the sole anesthetic in short surgical procedures when combined with nitrous oxide. Adjunctive use of potent opioids (eg, fentanyl and sufentanil; see Chapter 31) contributes cardiovascular stability, enhanced sedation, and profound perioperative analgesia. Benzodiazepines (eg, midazolam, diazepam) have a slower onset and slower recovery than the barbiturates or propofol and are rarely used for induction of anesthesia. However, preanesthetic administration of benzodiazepines (eg, midazolam) can be used to provide anxiolysis, sedation, and amnesia when used in conjunction with other anesthetic agents.

\section*{BARBI TURATES}

The general pharmacology of the barbiturates is discussed in Chapter 22. Thiopental is a barbiturate commonly used for induction of anesthesia. Thiamylal is structurally almost identical to thiopental and has the same pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile.

After an intravenous bolus injection, thiopental rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier and, if given in sufficient dosage, produces loss of consciousness (hypnosis) in one circulation time. Similar effects occur with the shorter-acting barbiturate, methohexital. With both of these barbiturates, plasma: brain equilibrium occurs rapidly (<1 minute) because of their high lipid solubility. Thiopental rapidly diffuses out of the brain and other highly vascular tissues and is redistributed to muscle and fat (Figure 25-6). Because of this rapid removal from brain tissue, a single dose of thiopental produces only a brief period of unconsciousness. Thiopental is metabolized at the rate of only 12-16\% per hour in humans following a single dose and less than $1 \%$ of the administered dose of thiopental is excreted unchanged by the kidney.

Redistribution of thiopental after an intravenous bolus administration. Note that the time axis is not linear.

With large doses (or a continuous infusion), thiopental produces dose-dependent decreases in arterial blood pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac output. These hemodynamic effects are due primarily to a myocardial depressant effect and increased venous capacitance; there is little change in total peripheral resistance. Thiopental is also a potent respiratory depressant, producing transient apnea and lowering the sensitivity of the medullary respiratory center to carbon dioxide.

Cerebral metabolism and oxygen utilization are decreased after barbiturate administration in proportion to the degree of cerebral depression. Cerebral blood flow is also decreased, but less than oxygen consumption. Because intracranial pressure and blood volume are not increased (in contrast to the volatile anesthetics), thiopental is a desirable drug for patients with cerebral swelling (eg, head trauma, brain tumors). Methohexital can cause central excitatory activity (eg, myoclonus) and has been useful for neurosurgical procedures involving ablation of seizure foci. However, it also has antiseizure activity and is the drug of choice for providing anesthesia in patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Given its more rapid elimination, methohexital is also preferred over thiopental for short ambulatory procedures.

Barbiturates reduce hepatic blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, but these drugs produce no adverse effects on hepatic or renal function. Barbiturates can exacerbate acute intermittent porphyria by inducing the production of hepatic a occasions, thiopental has precipitated porphyric crisis when used as an induction agent in susceptible patients.

\section*{BENZODI AZEPI NES}

Diazepam, lorazepam, and midazolam are used in anesthetic procedures. The primary indication is for premedication because of their sedative, anxiolytic, and amnestic properties, and to control acute agitation. (The basic pharmacology of benzodiazepines is discussed in Chapter 22.) Diazepam and lorazepam are not water-soluble, and their intravenous use necessitates nonaqueous vehicles, which cause pain and local irritation. Midazolam is water-soluble and is the benzodiazepine of choice for parenteral administration. It is important that the drug becomes lipid-soluble at physiologic pH and can readily cross the blood-brain barrier to produce its central effects.

Compared with the intravenous barbiturates, benzodiazepines produce a slower onset of central nervous system depressant effects which reach a plateau at a depth of sedation that is inadequate for surgical anesthesia. Using large doses of benzodiazepines to achieve deep sedation prolongs the postanesthetic recovery period and can produce a high incidence of anterograde amnesia. Because it possesses sedative-anxiolytic properties and causes a high incidence of amnesia (> 50\%), midazolam is frequently administered intravenously before patients enter the operating room. Midazolam has a more rapid onset, a shorter elimination half-life (2-4 hours), and a steeper dose-response curve than do the other available benzodiazepines.

The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can be used to accelerate recovery when excessive doses of intravenous benzodiazepines are administered (especially in elderly patients). However, reversal of benzodiazepine-induced respiratory depression is less predictable. The short duration of action (< 90 minutes) of flumazenil may necessitate multiple doses to prevent recurrence of the central nervous system depressant effects of the longer-acting benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, diazepam).

\section*{OPIOID ANALGESICS}

Large doses of opioid analgesics have been used in combination with large doses of benzodiazepines to achieve a general anesthetic state, particularly in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or other major surgery when the patient's circulatory reserve is limited. Although intravenous morphine, $1-3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, was used many years ago, the high-potency opioids fentanyl, $100-150 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg}$, and sufentanil, $0.25-0.5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV, have been used more recently in such patients. More recently also, remifentanil, a potent and extremely short-acting opioid, has been used to minimize residual ventilatory depression.

Despite the use of high doses of potent opioids (see Table 31-2), awareness during anesthesia and unpleasant postoperative recall can occur. Furthermore, high doses of opioids during surgery can cause chest wall (and laryngeal) rigidity, thereby acutely impairing ventilation, as well as increasing postoperative opioid requirements owing to the development of acute tolerance. Therefore, lower doses of fentanyl and sufentanil have been used as premedication and as an adjunct to both intravenous and inhaled anesthetics to provide perioperative analgesia. The shorter-acting alfentanil and remifentanil have been used as co-induction agents with intravenous sedative-hypnotic anesthetics because they have a rapid onset of action. Remifentanil is rapidly metabolized by esterases in the blood (not plasma cholinesterase) and muscle tissues, contributing to an extremely rapid recovery from its opioid effects. The metabolism of remifentanil is not subject to genetic variability, and the drug does not interfere with the clearance of other compounds metabolized by plasma cholinesterase (eg, esmolol, mivacurium, or succinylcholine). Opioid analgesics can also be administered in very low doses by the epidural and subarachnoid (spinal) routes of administration to produce excellent postoperative analgesia. Fentanyl and droperidol (a butyrophenone related to haloperidol) administered together produce analgesia and amnesia and combined with nitrous oxide
provide a state referred to as neuroleptanesthesia.

\section*{PROPOFOL}

Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) has become the most popular intravenous anesthetic. Its rate of onset of action is similar to that of the intravenous barbiturates but recovery is more rapid and patients are able to ambulate earlier after general anesthesia. Furthermore, patients subjectively "feel better" in the immediate postoperative period because of the reduction in postoperative nausea and vomiting. Propofol is used for both induction and maintenance of anesthesia as part of total intravenous or balanced anesthesia techniques and is the agent of choice for ambulatory surgery. The drug is also effective in producing prolonged sedation in patients in critical care settings (see Conscious \& Deep Sedation). When administered by prolonged infusion for sedation or ventilatory management in the intensive care unit, cumulative effects can lead to delayed arousal. In addition, prolonged administration of conventional emulsion formulations can elevate serum lipid levels. Use of propofol for the sedation of critically ill young children has led to severe acidosis in the presence of respiratory infections and to possible neurologic sequelae upon withdrawal.

After intravenous administration of propofol, the distribution half-life is 2-8 minutes, and the redistribution half-life is approximately $30-60$ minutes. The drug is rapidly metabolized in the liver at a rate ten times faster than thiopental. Propofol is excreted in the urine as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, with less than $1 \%$ of the parent drug excreted unchanged. Total body clearance of the anesthetic is greater than hepatic blood flow, suggesting that its elimination includes extrahepatic mechanisms in addition to metabolism by liver enzymes. This property can be useful in patients with impaired ability to metabolize other sedative-anesthetic drugs.

Effects on respiratory function are similar to those of thiopental at usual anesthetic doses and include dose-related depression of central ventilatory drive and apnea. However, propofol causes a marked decrease in blood pressure during induction of anesthesia through decreased peripheral arterial resistance and venodilation. In addition, propofol has greater direct negative inotropic effects than other intravenous anesthetics. Pain at the site of injection is the most common adverse effect of bolus administration. Muscle movements, hypotonus, and (rarely) tremors have also been reported after prolonged use. Clinical infections due to bacterial contamination of the propofol emulsion have led to the addition of antimicrobial adjuvants (eg, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA] and metabisulfite). Newer formulations of propofol have been developed that contain less lipid for prolonged administration (eg, Ampofol). However, pain on injection is increased when the lipid content is reduced. Admixture or pretreatment with lidocaine ( $20-50 \mathrm{mg}$ ) is the most effective approach to minimizing the pain on injection of propofol.

\section*{Conscious \& Deep Sedation}

Many diagnostic and minor therapeutic surgical procedures can be performed without general anesthesia. In this setting, regional or local anesthesia supplemented with midazolam or propofol and opioid analgesics (or ketamine) may be a more appropriate and safer approach than general anesthesia.

Another approach has led to the development of conscious sedation or drug-induced alleviation of anxiety and pain in combination with an altered level of consciousness associated with minimal sedation and retention of the ability of the patient to maintain a patent airway and to respond to verbal commands. A wide variety of intravenous anesthetic agents have proved to be useful drugs in conscious sedation techniques (eg, diazepam, midazolam, propofol). For example, intravenous midazolam, propofol, and a potent opioid analgesic can provide amnestic, sedative, and analgesic effects without loss of consciousness as part of a monitored anesthesia care (MAC) technique. Use of benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics in conscious sedation protocols has the advantage of being reversible by the specific receptor antagonist drugs (flumazenil and naloxone, respectively).

A specialized form of conscious sedation is occasionally required in the ICU, when patients are under severe stress and require mechanical ventilation for prolonged periods. In this situation, sedative-hypnotic drugs or low doses of intravenous anesthetics, neuromuscular blocking drugs, and dexmedetomidine may be combined. Dexmedetomidine is an $\alpha_{2}$ agonist with sedative and analgesic effects. It has a half-life of 2-3 hours and is metabolized in the liver and excreted mainly as inactive urinary metabolites.

Deep sedation is similar to a light state of general anesthesia involving decreased consciousness from which the patient is not easily aroused. Because deep sedation is often accompanied by a loss of protective reflexes, an inability to maintain a patent airway, and lack of verbal responsiveness to surgical stimuli, this state may be indistinguishable from general anesthesia. Intravenous agents used in deep sedation protocols include thiopental, methohexital, ketamine, propofol, and the potent opioid analgesics.

\section*{ETOMI DATE}

Etomidate is a carboxylated imidazole that can be used for induction of anesthesia in patients with limited cardiovascular reserve. Its major advantage over other intravenous anesthetics is that it causes minimal cardiovascular and respiratory depression. Etomidate produces a rapid loss of consciousness, with minimal hypotension even in elderly patients with poor cardiovascular reserve. The heart rate is usually unchanged, and the incidence of apnea is low. The drug has no analgesic effects, and coadministration of opioids may be required to decrease cardiac responses during tracheal intubation and to lessen spontaneous muscle movements. Following an induction dose, initial recovery with etomidate is less rapid (< 10 minutes) compared with recovery with propofol.

Distribution of etomidate is rapid, with a biphasic plasma concentration curve showing initial and intermediate distribution half-lives of 3 and 29 minutes, respectively. Redistribution of the drug from brain to highly perfused tissues appears to be responsible for the relatively short duration of its anesthetic effects. Etomidate is extensively metabolized in the liver and plasma to inactive
metabolites, with only $2 \%$ of the drug excreted unchanged in the urine.
Etomidate causes a high incidence of pain on injection, myoclonic activity, and postoperative nausea and vomiting. The involuntary muscle movements are not associated with electroencephalographic epileptiform activity. Etomidate may also cause adrenocortical suppression via inhibitory effects on steroidogenesis, with decreased plasma levels of cortisol after a single dose. Prolonged infusion of etomidate in critically ill patients may result in hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, and oliguria because of its adrenal suppressive effects.

\section*{KETAMI NE}

Ketamine is a racemic mixture of two optical isomers, $\mathrm{S}(+)$ and $\mathrm{R}(-)$ ketamine. The drug produces a dissociative anesthetic state characterized by catatonia, amnesia, and analgesia, with or without loss of consciousness (hypnosis). The drug is an arylcyclohexylamine chemically related to phencyclidine (PCP), a drug with a high abuse potential owing to its psychoactive properties. The mechanism of action of ketamine may involve blockade of the membrane effects of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamic acid at the NMDA receptor subtype (see Chapter 21). Ketamine is a highly lipophilic drug and is rapidly distributed into well-perfused organs, including the brain, liver, and kidney. Subsequently ketamine is redistributed to less well perfused tissues with concurrent hepatic metabolism followed by both urinary and biliary excretion.

Ketamine is the only intravenous anesthetic that possesses both analgesic properties and the ability to produce dose-related cardiovascular stimulation. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and cardiac output can be significantly increased above baseline values. These variables reach a peak $2-4$ minutes after an intravenous bolus injection, then slowly decline to normal values over the next 10-20 minutes. Ketamine produces its cardiovascular effects by stimulating the central sympathetic nervous system and, to a lesser extent, by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine at sympathetic nerve terminals. Increases in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels occur as early as 2 minutes after an intravenous bolus of ketamine and return to baseline levels in less than 15 minutes.

Ketamine markedly increases cerebral blood flow, oxygen consumption, and intracranial pressure. Similar to the volatile anesthetics, ketamine is a potentially dangerous drug when intracranial pressure is elevated. Although ketamine decreases the respiratory rate, upper airway muscle tone is well maintained and airway reflexes are usually preserved.

Use of ketamine has been associated with postoperative disorientation, sensory and perceptual illusions, and vivid dreams (so-called emergence phenomena). Diazepam, $0.2-0.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, or midazolam, $0.025-0.05 \mathrm{mg}$ intravenously, given before the administration of ketamine reduce the incidence of these adverse effects. Because of the high incidence of postoperative psychic phenomena associated with its use, ketamine fell into disfavor. However, use of low doses of ketamine in combination with other intravenous and inhaled anesthetics has become an increasingly popular alternative to opioid analgesics to minimize ventilatory depression. In addition, ketamine is very useful for poor-risk geriatric patients and high-risk patients in cardiogenic or septic shock because of its cardiostimulatory properties. It is also used in low doses for outpatient anesthesia in combination with propofol and in children undergoing painful procedures (eg, dressing changes for burns). In an effort to enhance ketamine's efficacy and reduce its side-effect profile, investigators separated the isomers and demonstrated that the $S(+)$ ketamine possessed greater anesthetic and analgesic potency. However,
even the $S(+)$ isomer of ketamine possesses psychotomimetic side effects.

\section*{LOCAL ANESTHETI CS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Local anesthetics reversibly block impulse conduction along nerve axons and other excitable membranes that utilize sodium channels as the primary means of action potential generation. Clinically, local anesthetics are use to block pain sensation from-or sympathetic vasoconstrictor impulses to-specific areas of the body. The first local anesthetic introduced into medical practice, cocaine, was isolated by Niemann in 1860 and introduced into practice by Koller in 1884 as an ophthalmic anesthetic. Despite the fact that its chronic use was associated with psychological dependence (addiction), cocaine was used clinically because it was the only local anesthetic drug available for 30 years. In an attempt to improve upon the clinical properties of cocaine, Einhorn in 1905 synthesized procaine, which became the dominant local anesthetic for the next 50 years. Subsequently, newer local anesthetics were introduced with the goal of reducing local tissue irritation, minimizing systemic cardiac ar central nervous system (CNS) toxicity, and achieving a faster onset and longer duration of action. Lidocaine, which is still the most widely used local anesthetic, was synthesized in 1943 by Löfgren.

The development of newer agents continues because it is relatively easy to synthesize chemicals with local anesthetic properties. Unfortunately, it is difficult to reduce the toxicity of these compounds because the comm side effects of local anesthetics represent extensions of their therapeutic effects. New research into the mechanisms of local anesthetic-induced cardiac and spinal toxicity and identification of alternative drug targets for spinal analgesia (eg, opioid receptors, $\omega_{2}$ adrenoceptors, NMDA receptors, N-type calcium channels, and adenosine receptors) suggest that it may be possible to develop safer drugs in the future. To extend the duratir of the local anesthetic action, a variety of novel delivery systems are in development (eg, polymers, suspensions). Transdermal local anesthetic delivery systems have also been successfully introduced into clinical practice for providing topical analgesia.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF LOCAL ANESTHETI CS}

\section*{Chemistry}

Most local anesthetic agents consist of a lipophilic group (eg, an aromatic ring) connected by an intermediate chain via an ester or amide to an ionizable group (eg, a tertiary amine) (Figure 26-1; Table 26-1). In addition 1 the general physical properties of the molecules, specific stereochemical configurations are associated with differences in the potency of stereoisomers (eg, bupivacaine, ropivacaine). Because ester links are more prone hydrolysis than amide links, esters usually have a shorter duration of action.

Local anesthetics are weak bases and are usually made available clinically as salts to increase solubility and stability. In the body, they exist either as the uncharged base or as a cation. The relative proportions of these two forms is governed by their $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}$ and the pH of the body fluids according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
$$\log \frac{\text { Cationic form }}{\text { Uncharged form }}=\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}-\mathrm{pH}$$

Because the $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}$ of most local anesthetics is in the range of 8.0-9.0, the larger percentage in body fluids at physiologic pH will be the charged, cationic form. The cationic form is the most active form at the receptor site because it cannot readily exit from closed channels. However, the uncharged form is important for rapid penetration of biologic membranes and producing a clinical effect, since the local anesthetic receptor is not readily accessible from the external side of the cell membrane. Therefore, local anesthetics are much less effective when they are injected into infected tissues because a smaller percentage of the local anesthetic is nonionized and available for diffusion across the membrane in an environment with a low extracellular pH .

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

The pharmacokinetic properties of the commonly used amide local anesthetics are summarized in Table 26-2. The pharmacokinetics of the ester-based local anesthetics have not been extensively studied owing to their rap breakdown in plasma (elimination half-life < 1 minute). Local anesthetics are usually administered by injection into dermis and soft tissues located in the area of nerves. Thus, absorption and distribution are not as importan in controlling the onset of effect as in determining the rate of offset of local analgesia, and the likelihood of CNS and cardiac toxicity. Topical application of local anesthetics (eg, transmucosal or transdermal) requires drug diffusion for both onset and offset of anesthetic effect.

\section*{ABSORPTION}

Systemic absorption of injected local anesthetic from the site of administration is determined by several factors including dosage, site of injection, drug-tissue binding, local blood flow, use of vasoconstrictors (eg, epinephrinı and the physicochemical properties of the drug itself. Application of a local anesthetic to a highly vascular area
such as the tracheal mucosa or the tissue surrounding intercostal nerves results in more rapid absorption and thus higher blood levels than if the local anesthetic had been injected into a poorly perfused tissue such as tendon, dermis, or subcutaneous fat. For regional anesthesia involving block of large nerves, maximum blood levels of local anesthetic decrease according to the site of administration in the following order: intercostal (highest) > caudal > epidural > brachial plexus > sciatic nerve (lowest).

Vasoconstrictor substances such as epinephrine reduce systemic absorption of local anesthetics from the injecti site by decreasing blood flow in these areas. This is important for drugs with intermediate or short durations of action such as procaine, lidocaine, and mepivacaine (but not prilocaine).

Since blood levels are lowered up to $30 \%$ when vasoconstrictors are added to local anesthetics, localized neuronal uptake is enhanced because of higher local tissue concentrations in the region of drug administration, and the systemic toxic effects are reduced. Furthermore, when used in spinal anesthesia, epinephrine acts directly on the cord to both enhance and prolong local anesthetic-induced spinal anesthesia by acting on $a_{2}$ adrenoceptors, which inhibit release of substance $P$ (neurokinin-1) and reduce sensory neuron firing. The recognition of this fact has led to the use of clonidine and dexmedetomidine to augment local anesthetic effect the subarachnoid space and on peripheral nerves. The combination of reduced systemic absorption, enhanced local neuronal anesthetic uptake, and $a_{2}$ activation by epinephrine in the CNS is responsible for prolonging the local anesthetic effect by up to $50 \%$. Vasoconstrictors are less effective in prolonging anesthetic action of the more lipid-soluble, long-acting drugs (eg, bupivacaine and ropivacaine), possibly because these molecules are highly tissue-bound. Finally, cocaine is unique owing to its intrinsic sympathomimetic properties.

\section*{DI STRI BUTI ON}

The amide local anesthetics are widely distributed after intravenous bolus administration. There is also evidenct that sequestration can occur in lipophilic storage sites (eg, fat). After an initial rapid distribution phase, which consists of uptake into highly perfused organs such as the brain, liver, kidney, and heart, a slower distribution phase occurs with uptake into moderately well-perfused tissues, such as muscle and the gastrointestinal tract. a result of the extremely short plasma half-lives of the ester type agents, their tissue distribution has not been extensively studied.

\section*{METABOLISM AND EXCRETION}

The local anesthetics are converted in the liver (amide type) or in plasma (ester type) to more water-soluble metabolites and then excreted in the urine. Since local anesthetics in the uncharged form diffuse readily throug lipid membranes, little or no urinary excretion of the neutral form occurs. Acidification of urine promotes ionization of the tertiary amine base to the more water-soluble charged form, which is more readily excreted.

Ester-type local anesthetics are hydrolyzed very rapidly in the blood by circulating butyrylcholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) to inactive metabolites. Therefore, procaine and chloroprocaine have very short plasma half-lives (< 1 minute).

The amide linkage of amide local anesthetics is hydrolyzed by liver microsomal cytochrome P450 isozymes. The is considerable variation in the rate of liver metabolism of individual amide compounds, the approximate order being prilocaine (fastest) > lidocaine > mepivacaine > ropivacaine > bupivacaine and levobupivacaine (slowest As a result, toxicity from amide-type local anesthetics is more likely to occur in patients with hepatic disease. Fc example, the average elimination half-life of lidocaine may be increased from 1.6 hours in normal patients ( $\mathrm{t}_{1 / 2}$ Table 26-2) to more than 6 hours in patients with severe liver disease. Many other drugs used in anesthesia ar metabolized by the same P450 isozymes, and concomitant use of these competing drugs may slow the hepatic
metabolism of the local anesthetics.
Decreased hepatic elimination of local anesthetics would also be anticipated in patients with reduced hepatic blood flow. For example, the hepatic elimination of lidocaine in patients anesthetized with volatile anesthetics (which reduce liver blood flow) is slower than in patients anesthetized with intravenous anesthetics.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

\section*{MECHANI SM OF ACTION}

The primary mechanism of action of local anesthetics is blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels (Figur. 26-2). The excitable membrane of nerve axons, like the membrane of cardiac muscle (see Chapter 14) and neuronal cell bodies (see Chapter 21), maintains a resting transmembrane potential of - 90 to - 60 mV . During excitation, the sodium channels open, and a fast inward sodium current quickly depolarizes the membrane toward the sodium equilibrium potential ( +40 mV ). As a result of depolarization, the sodium channels close (inactivate) and potassium channels open. The outward flow of potassium repolarizes the membrane toward thi potassium equilibrium potential (about -95 mV ); repolarization returns the sodium channels to the rested state The transmembrane ionic gradients are maintained by the sodium pump. These ionic fluxes are similar to those heart muscle, and local anesthetics have similar effects in both tissues.

Functional and structural features of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel that determine local anesthetic (LA) interactions. A: Cartoon of the sodium channel in an axonal membrane in the resting (h gate open), activated (h gate open), and inactivated states (h gate closed). Recovery from the inactivated, refractory state requires opening of the h gate. Local anesthetics bind to a receptor ( within the channel and access it via the membrane phase or from the cytoplasm. B: Molecular arrangement of the 6 membrane-spanning peptides, four of which combine to form the channel around a central pore. The S4 segments (marked with "+" signs) are thought to constitute the voltage-sensing "m" gates of the channel. The linker peptide connecting the III
and IV hexamers acts as the inactivation "h" gate. Ions travel through an open channel along a pore defined at its narrowes dimension by partial membrane penetration of the four extracellular loops of protein connecting S5 and S6 in each domain. Local anesthetic binding occurs on S6 segments and at other regions of the channel. C: Three-dimensional cartoon showing the configuration of the four hexamers around the central pore in the membrane.

The function of sodium channels can be disrupted in several ways. Biologic toxins such as batrachotoxin, aconitine, veratridine, and some scorpion venoms bind to receptors within the channel and prevent inactivation. This results in prolonged influx of sodium through the channel and depolarization of the resting potential. The marine toxins tetrodotoxin (TTX) and saxitoxin block sodium channels by binding to channel receptors near the extracellular surface. Their clinical effects superficially resemble those of local anesthetics (it block of conduction without a change in the resting potential) even though their receptor site is quite different. Spinal neurons can be differentiated on the basis of tetrodotoxin effect into TTX-sensitive and TTX-resistant neurons. Some evidence suggests that the TTX-resistant neurons are responsible for pain transmission and are the primary targets for local anesthetics in producing spinal anesthesia. Local anesthetics bind to receptors nea the intracellular end of the sodium channel and block the channel in a time- and voltage-dependent fashion (se below). The sodium channel has been cloned, its primary structure has been characterized, and mutational analysis has allowed identification of parts of the local anesthetic binding site.

When progressively increasing concentrations of a local anesthetic are applied to a nerve fiber, the threshold fo excitation increases, impulse conduction slows, the rate of rise of the action potential declines, the action potential amplitude decreases, and, finally, the ability to generate an action potential is completely abolished. These progressive effects result from binding of the local anesthetic to more and more sodium channels. If the sodium current is blocked over a critical length of the nerve, propagation across the blocked area is no longer possible. In myelinated nerves, the critical length is 2 to 3 nodes of Ranvier. At the minimum dose required to block propagation, the resting potential is not significantly altered.

The blockade of sodium channels by most local anesthetics is both voltage- and time-dependent: Channels in tr rested state, which predominate at more negative membrane potentials, have a much lower affinity for local anesthetics than activated (open state) and inactivated channels, which predominate at more positive membra potentials (see Figure 14-8). Thus, the effect of a given drug concentration is more marked in rapidly firing axc than in resting fibers (Figure 26-3).

Effect of repetitive activity on the block of sodium current produced by a local anesthetic in a myelinated axon. A series of 2 ! pulses was applied, and the resulting sodium currents (downward deflections) are superimposed. Note that the current produced by the pulses rapidly decreased from the first to the 25th pulse. A long rest period following the train resulted in recovery from block, but the block could be reinstated by a subsequent train. (nA, nanoamperes.) (Modified and reproduced, with permission, from Courtney KR: Mechanism of frequency-dependent inhibition of sodium currents in frog myelinated ner by the lidocaine derivative GEA. J Pharmacol Exp Ther 1975; 195: 225.)

Between successive action potentials, a portion of the sodium channels will recover from the local anesthetic block (see Figure 14-8). The recovery from drug-induced block is 10 to 1000 times slower than the recovery of channels from normal inactivation (as shown for the cardiac membrane in Figure 14-4). As a result, the refractory period is lengthened and the nerve conducts fewer impulses.

Elevated extracellular calcium partially antagonizes the action of local anesthetics owing to the calcium-induced increase in the surface potential on the membrane (which favors the low-affinity rested state). Conversely, increases in extracellular potassium depolarize the membrane potential and favor the inactivated state, enhancing the effect of local anesthetics.

Local anesthetics can be shown to block a variety of other ion channels, including nicotinic acetylcholine channe in the spinal cord. However, there is no convincing evidence that this mechanism is important in the clinical effects of these drugs. High concentrations of local anesthetics can interfere with intra-axonal transport and calcium homeostasis in the nerve terminal, contributing to potential spinal toxicity.

\section*{STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY CHARACTERISTICS OF LOCAL ANESTHETICS}

The smaller and more lipophilic the local anesthetic, the faster the rate of interaction with the sodium channel receptor. Potency is also positively correlated with lipid solubility as long as the agent retains sufficient water solubility to diffuse to the site of action on the neuronal membrane. Lidocaine, procaine, and mepivacaine are more water-soluble than tetracaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine. The latter agents are more potent and have longer durations of local anesthetic action. These long-acting local anesthetics also bind more extensively to proteins and can be displaced from these binding sites by other protein-bound drugs. In the case of optically active agents (eg, bupivacaine), the $S(+)$ isomer can usually be shown to be moderately more potent than the (-) isomer.

\section*{OTHER ACTIONS ON NERVES}

Since local anesthetics are capable of blocking all nerves, their actions are not limited to the desired loss of sensation from sites of noxious (painful) stimuli. Although motor paralysis can be desirable during surgery, it $m$ also limit the ability of the patient to cooperate during obstetric delivery or ambulate after outpatient surgery. During spinal anesthesia, motor paralysis may impair respiratory activity and autonomic nerve blockade can lec to hypotension upon ambulation. Residual autonomic blockade interferes with bladder function resulting in urini retention and the need for catheterization.

Nerve fibers differ significantly in their susceptibility to local anesthetic blockade on the basis of differences in si and degree of myelination (Table 26-3). Upon direct application of a local anesthetic to a nerve root, the smalle B and C fibers are blocked first, followed by other sensations, and motor function is the last to be blocked.

\section*{Effect of Fiber Diameter}

Local anesthetics preferentially block small fibers because the distance over which such fibers can passively propagate an electrical impulse is shorter. During the onset of local anesthesia, when short sections of the nerv are blocked, the small-diameter fibers are the first to fail to conduct. For myelinated nerves, at least two and preferably three successive nodes of Ranvier must be blocked by the local anesthetic to halt impulse propagatic With larger and thicker nerve fibers (eg, motor neurons), the nodes are farther apart, creating greater resistan to blockade. Myelinated nerves tend to become blocked before unmyelinated nerves of the same diameter. For
this reason, the preganglionic B fibers are blocked before the smaller unmyelinated C fibers involved in pain transmission.

\section*{Effect of Firing Frequency}

Another important reason for preferential blockade of sensory fibers follows directly from the state- and usedependent mechanism of action of local anesthetics. Blockade by these drugs is more marked at higher frequencies of depolarization. Sensory (pain) fibers have a high firing rate and a relatively long action potential duration. Motor fibers fire at a slower rate and have a shorter action potential duration. Type A delta and C fibe are smaller-diameter fibers that participate in high-frequency pain transmission. Therefore, these fibers are blocked earlier with lower concentrations of local anesthetics than are the large A alpha fibers.

\section*{Effect of Fiber Position in the Nerve Bundle}

An anatomic circumstance that sometimes creates exceptions to the above rules for differential nerve block is $t$ location of the fibers in the peripheral nerve bundle. In large nerve trunks, motor nerves are usually located circumferentially, and for that reason they are the first to be exposed to the local anesthetic when it is administered into the tissue surrounding the nerve. Therefore, it is not uncommon for motor nerve block to occl before sensory block in large mixed nerves. In the extremities, proximal sensory fibers are located in the outer portion of the nerve trunk, whereas the distal sensory innervation is in the core of the nerve. Thus, during infiltration block of a large nerve, sensory analgesia first develops proximally and then spreads distally as the drug penetrates into the core of the nerve.

\section*{EFFECTS ON OTHER EXCITABLE MEMBRANES}

Local anesthetics have weak neuromuscular blocking effects that are of little clinical importance. However, their effects on cardiac cell membranes are of major clinical significance, and some local anesthetics are useful antiarrhythmic agents (see Chapter 14) at concentrations lower than those required to produce nerve block. Others (eg, bupivacaine, ropivacaine) can cause lethal arrhythmias in high concentrations.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF LOCAL ANESTHETI CS}

Local anesthetics can provide highly effective analgesia in well-defined regions of the body. The usual routes of administration include topical application (eg, nasal mucosa, wound margins), injection in the vicinity of peripheral nerve endings (infiltration) and major nerve trunks (blocks), and injection into the epidural or subarachnoid spaces surrounding the spinal cord (Figure 26-4). Intravenous regional anesthesia (so-called Bier block) is used for short surgical procedures (< 60 minutes) involving the upper and lower extremities. This is accomplished by intravenous injection of the anesthetic agent into a distal vein while the circulation of the limb isolated with a proximally placed tourniquet. Finally, an infiltration block of autonomic sympathetic fibers can be used to evaluate the role of sympathetic tone in patients with peripheral vasospastic disorders.

Schematic diagram of sites of injection of local anesthetics in and near the spinal canal.

The choice of local anesthetic for infiltration, peripheral nerve blocks, and central neuraxis blockade is usually based on the duration of action required. Procaine and chloroprocaine are short-acting; lidocaine, mepivacaine, and prilocaine have an intermediate duration of action; and tetracaine, bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine are long-acting local anesthetics (Table 26-1).

The anesthetic effect of the agents with short and intermediate durations of action can be prolonged by increasing the dose or adding a vasoconstrictor agent (eg, epinephrine or phenylephrine). The vasoconstrictor slows the removal of the local anesthetic from the injection site. In addition, it decreases the blood level and th probability of CNS toxicity.

The onset of local anesthesia can be accelerated by the addition of sodium bicarbonate ( $1-2 \mathrm{~mL}$ ) to the local anesthetic solution. This maximizes the amount of drug in the more lipid-soluble form.

Repeated injections of local anesthetics can result in loss of effectiveness (ie, tachyphylaxis) due to extracellula acidosis. Local anesthetics are commonly marketed as hydrochloride salts (pH 4.0-6.0). After injection, the salt are buffered in the tissue to physiologic pH , thereby providing sufficient free base concentration for diffusion through the axonal membrane. However, repeated injections of the local anesthetic can deplete the buffering capacity of the local tissues. The ensuing acidosis increases the extracellular cationic form, which diffuses poorl: and results in tachyphylaxis. Tachyphylaxis to local anesthetics is common in areas with a limited buffer capacit (eg, the cerebrospinal fluid).

Pregnancy appears to increase susceptibility to local anesthetic toxicity, with reductions in the median doses required for neural blockade and to induce toxicity. Cardiac arrest leading to death following the epidural administration of $0.75 \%$ bupivacaine to women in labor resulted in the temporary withdrawal of the high concentration of this widely used long-acting local anesthetic. The subsequent introduction of purportedly less cardiotoxic alternatives to bupivacaine (ie, ropivacaine and levobupivacaine) has led to controversy because the evidence supporting enhanced safety is based on animal models. It is not clear whether the increased sensitivit to bupivacaine during pregnancy is due to elevated levels of estrogen, progesterone, or some other unrecognizi factor.

Topical local anesthesia is often used for eye, ear, nose, and throat procedures and for cosmetic surgery. Satisfactory topical local anesthesia requires an agent capable of rapid penetration across the skin or mucosa, and with limited tendency to diffuse away from the site of application. Cocaine, because of its excellent penetration and local vasoconstrictor effects, has been used extensively for ear, nose and throat (ENT) procedures. Cocaine is somewhat irritating and therefore is less popular for ophthalmic procedures. Recent concern about its potential cardiotoxicity when combined with epinephrine has led most otolaryngologists and plastic surgeons to switch to a combination containing lidocaine and epinephrine. Other drugs used for topical anesthesia include tetracaine, pramoxine, dibucaine, benzocaine, and dyclonine.

Since local anesthetics have membrane-stabilizing effects, both parenteral (eg, intravenous lidocaine) and oral (eg, mexiletine, tocainide) formulations of local anesthetics have been used to treat patients with neuropathic pain syndromes because these syndromes are thought to involve uncontrolled, rapid, sensory fiber firing. Systemic local anesthetic drugs are commonly used as adjuvants to the combination of a tricyclic antidepressar (eg, amitriptyline) and an anticonvulsant (eg, carbamazepine) in patients who fail to respond to the combinatio of antidepressant and anticonvulsant. A period of 1-3 weeks may be required to observe a therapeutic effect after introduction of the local anesthetic in patients with neuropathic pain.

Toxicity

The two major forms of local anesthetic toxicity are: (1) systemic effects following absorption of the local anesthetic from their site of administration and (2) direct neurotoxicity from the local effects of these drugs whe administered in close proximity to the spinal cord and other major nerve trunks. When blood levels of local anesthetics rise rapidly, adverse effects on several major organ systems may be observed.

\section*{CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM}

\section*{All Local Anesthetics}

At low concentrations, all local anesthetics have the ability to produce sleepiness, light-headedness, visual and auditory disturbances, and restlessness. An early symptom of local anesthetic toxicity is circumoral and tongue numbness and a metallic taste. At higher concentrations, nystagmus and muscular twitching occur, followed by overt tonic-clonic convulsions. Local anesthetics apparently cause depression of cortical inhibitory pathways, thereby allowing unopposed activity of excitatory neuronal pathways. This transitional stage of unbalanced excitation (ie, seizure activity) is then followed by generalized CNS depression.

Convulsions due to excessive blood levels can usually be prevented by administering the smallest effective dost of the local anesthetic required for adequate surgical analgesia and by avoiding inadvertent intravascular injection, or injection into highly perfused tissues. When large doses of a local anesthetic are required (eg, for major peripheral nerve block), premedication with a parenteral benzodiazepine (eg, diazepam or midazolam) provides significant prophylaxis against local anesthetic-induced CNS toxicity by raising the seizure threshold.

If seizures do occur, it is important to prevent hypoxemia and acidosis. Although administration of oxygen does not prevent seizure activity, hyperoxemia may be beneficial after onset of seizures. Hypercapnia and acidosis may lower the seizure threshold, and so hyperventilation is recommended during treatment of seizures. In addition, hyperventilation increases blood pH, which in turn lowers extracellular potassium. This action hyperpolarizes the transmembrane potential of axons, which favors the rested (or low-affinity) state of the sodium channels, resulting in decreased local anesthetic toxicity.

Seizures induced by local anesthetics can also be treated with intravenous anesthetic drugs (eg, thiopental 1-2 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, propofol $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, midazolam $0.03-0.06 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, or diazepam $0.1-0.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ). The muscular manifestations of a seizure can be blocked using a short-acting neuromuscular relaxant drug (eg, succinylcholir $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV). It should be emphasized that succinylcholine does not obliterate CNS manifestations of seizur activity. Rapid tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation can prevent pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents and facilitate hyperventilation.

\section*{Cocaine}

Since prehistoric times, the natives of Peru and Bolivia have chewed the leaves of the indigenous plant Erythroxylon coca, the source of cocaine, to obtain a feeling of well-being and reduce fatigue. Intense CNS effe: can be achieved by sniffing cocaine powder and smoking cocaine base ("free basing"). Cocaine has become one of the most widely abused drugs (see Chapter 32). High doses of inhaled and injected cocaine have all of the toxicities described for other local anesthetics. In addition, cocaine can produce severe cardiovascular toxicity, including hypertension, arrhythmias, and myocardial failure.

\section*{NEUROTOXI CITY}

When applied at excessively high concentrations, all local anesthetics can produce direct neural toxicity. Chloroprocaine and lidocaine appear to be more neurotoxic than other local anesthetics when used for spinal anesthesia, with high local concentrations producing so-called transient radicular irritation (or transient neuropathic symptoms). It has been suggested that this toxicity results from pooling of high concentrations of
the local anesthetic in the cauda equina (Figure 26-4). Although the precise mechanism of this neurotoxic actio has not been established, both interference with axonal transport and disruption of calcium homeostasis have been implicated. Spinal neurotoxicity does not result from excessive sodium channel blockade.

\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM}

The cardiovascular effects of local anesthetics result partly from direct effects on the cardiac and smooth muscl membranes and partly from indirect effects on the autonomic nervous system. As described in Chapter 14, loce anesthetics block cardiac sodium channels and thus depress abnormal cardiac pacemaker activity, excitability, and conduction. At extremely high concentrations, local anesthetics can also block calcium channels. With the notable exception of cocaine, local anesthetics also depress the strength of cardiac contraction and cause arteriolar dilation, leading to systemic hypotension. Cardiovascular collapse is rare, but has been reported after large doses of bupivacaine and ropivacaine.

Cocaine differs from the other local anesthetics with respect to its cardiovascular effects. Cocaine's blockade of norepinephrine reuptake results in vasoconstriction and hypertension, as well as cardiac arrhythmias. The vasoconstriction produced by cocaine can lead to local ischemia and, in chronic abusers who use the nasal routı ulceration of the mucous membrane and damage to the nasal septum have been reported. The vasoconstrictor properties of cocaine can be used clinically to decrease bleeding from mucosal damage in the nasopharynx.

It has been suggested that bupivacaine may be more cardiotoxic than other long-acting local anesthetics. This reflects the fact that bupivacaine-induced blockade of sodium channels is potentiated by the long action potenti duration of cardiac cells compared with nerve fibers. The most common electrocardiographic finding in patients with bupivacaine intoxication is a slow idioventricular rhythm with broad QRS complexes and eventually electromechanical dissociation.

Resuscitation from bupivacaine cardiovascular toxicity is extremely difficult even for experienced clinicians. The (S) -isomer, levobupivacaine, appears to have a lower propensity for cardiovascular toxicity than the racemic mixture or the (R) -isomer and has been approved for clinical use. Ropivacaine has clinical (pharmacodynamic) effects similar to those of bupivacaine, but is allegedly associated with a lower potential for cardiovascular toxicity. Ropivacaine is available only as the (S) -stereoisomer, which has inherently less affinity for the cardiac sodium channel. However, both cardiac toxicity and CNS toxicity have been reported when ropivacaine was use for peripheral nerve blocks.

\section*{HEMATOLOGIC EFFECTS}

The administration of large doses ( $>10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) of prilocaine during regional anesthesia may lead to accumulati of the metabolite o -toluidine, an oxidizing agent capable of converting hemoglobin to methemoglobin. When sufficient methemoglobin is present ( $3-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), the patient may appear cyanotic and the blood "chocolatecolored." Although moderate levels of methemoglobinemia are well tolerated by healthy individuals, elevated methemoglobinemia may cause decompensation in patients with preexisting cardiac or pulmonary disease. The treatment of methemoglobinemia involves the intravenous administration of a reducing agent (eg, methylene blue or ascorbic acid), which rapidly converts methemoglobin to hemoglobin.

\section*{ALLERGIC REACTIONS}

The ester-type local anesthetics are metabolized to p- aminobenzoic acid derivatives. These metabolites are responsible for allergic reactions in a small percentage of the patient population. Amides are not metabolized to p- aminobenzoic acid, and allergic reactions to amide local anesthetics are extremely rare.

\section*{SKELETAL MUSCLE RELAXANTS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Drugs that affect skeletal muscle function as two very different therapeutic groups: those used during surgical procedures and in intensive care units to produce muscle paralysis for patients requiring ventilatory assistance (ie, neuromuscular blockers) and those used to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurologic conditions (ie, spasmolytics ). Neuromuscular blocking drugs interfere with transmission at the neuromuscular end plate and lack central nervous system activity. These compounds are used primarily as adjuncts during general anesthesi to facilitate tracheal intubation and optimize surgical conditions while ensuring adequate ventilation. Drugs in the spasmolytic group have traditionally been called "centrally acting" muscle relaxants and are used primarily to treat chronic back pain and fibromyalgic conditions. Dantrolene, a spasmolytic agent that has no significant central effects and is used primarily to treat malignant hyperthermia, is also discussed in this chapter.

\section*{NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKI NG DRUGS}

\section*{History}

During the 16th century, European explorers found that natives in the Amazon Basin of South America used curare, an arrow poison, to produce death by skeletal muscle paralysis. The active compound, d- tubocurarine, and its modern synthetic derivatives have had a significant influence on the practice of anesthesia and surgery and have proved useful in defining normal neuromuscular physiologic mechanisms.

\section*{Normal Neuromuscular Function}

The mechanism of neuromuscular transmission at the motor end plate is similar to that described for preganglionic cholinergic nerves in Chapter 6. With the arrival of an electrical impulse at the motor nerve terminal, there is an influx of calcium and release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine then diffuses across the synaptic cleft to the nicotinic receptor located on the motor end plate. As noted in Chapter 7, the adult $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{M}}$ receptor is composed of five peptides: two alpha peptides, one beta, one gamma, and one delta peptide (Figurı 27-1). The binding of two acetylcholine molecules to receptors on the $\alpha$ - $\beta$ and $\delta$ - a subunits causes opening o the channel. The subsequent movement of sodium and potassium is associated with a graded depolarization of the end plate membrane (Figure 27-2). This change in voltage is termed the motor end plate potential. The magnitude of the end plate potential is directly related to the amount of acetylcholine released. If the potential is small, the permeability and the end plate potential return to normal without an impulse being propagated from the end plate region to the rest of the muscle membrane. However, if the end plate potential is large, the adjacent muscle membrane is depolarized, and an action potential will be propagated along the entire muscle fiber. Muscle contraction is then initiated by excitation-contraction coupling. The released acetylcholine is quickl removed from the end plate region by diffusion and enzymatic destruction by the local acetylcholinesterase enzyme.

Schematic representation of the neuromuscular junction. (ACh, acetylcholine; AChE, acetylcholinesterase; JF, junctional folds; M, mitochondrion; V, transmitter vesicle.) (Reproduced, with permission, from Drachman DB: Myasthenia gravis. N Engl J Med 1978; 298: 135.)

At least two additional types of acetylcholine receptors are associated with the neuromuscular apparatus. One type is located on the presynaptic motor axon terminal, and activation of these receptors mobilizes additional transmitter for subsequent release by moving more acetylcholine vesicles toward the synaptic membrane. The second type of receptor is found on perijunctional cells and is not normally involved in neuromuscular transmission. However, under certain conditions (eg, prolonged immobilization, thermal burns), these receptor: may proliferate sufficiently to affect subsequent neuromuscular transmission.

Skeletal muscle relaxation and paralysis can occur from interruption of function at several sites along the pathway from the central nervous system to myelinated somatic nerves, unmyelinated motor nerve terminals, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the motor end plate, the muscle membrane, and the intracellular contractile apparatus itself.

In practice, blockade of end plate function is accomplished by two basic mechanisms. Pharmacologic blockade c the physiologic agonist acetylcholine is characteristic of the antagonist neuromuscular blocking drugs. These drugs prevent access of the transmitter to its receptor and thereby prevent depolarization. The prototype of thi nondepolarizing subgroup is $\mathbf{d}$ - tubocurarine. The second mechanism of blockade can be produced by an excess of a depolarizing agonist, such as acetylcholine. This paradoxical effect of acetylcholine also occurs at th. ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The prototypical depolarizing blocking drug is succinylcholine. A similar depolarizing block can be produced by acetylcholine itself when high local concentrations are achieved ir the synaptic cleft (eg, by cholinesterase inhibitor intoxication) and by nicotine and other nicotinic agonists. However, the neuromuscular block produced by these depolarizing drugs (other than succinylcholine) cannot be
precisely controlled and is of no clinical value.

\section*{BASIC PHARMACOLOGY OF NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKI NG DRUGS}

\section*{Chemistry}

All of the available neuromuscular blocking drugs bear a structural resemblance to acetylcholine. For example, succinylcholine is two acetylcholine molecules linked end-to-end (Figure 27-3). In contrast to the single linear structure of succinylcholine and other depolarizing drugs, the nondepolarizing agents (eg, pancuronium) conce the "double-acetylcholine" structure in one of two types of bulky, semi-rigid ring systems (Figure 27-3). The tw major families of nondepolarizing blocking drugs—the isoquinoline and steroid derivatives—are shown in Figure: 27-4 and 27-5. Another feature common to all currently used neuromuscular blockers is the presence of one ol two quaternary nitrogens, which makes them poorly lipid-soluble and limits entry into the central nervous system.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics of Neuromuscular Blocking Drugs}

All of the neuromuscular blocking drugs are highly polar and inactive orally and must be administered parenterally.

\section*{NONDEPOLARIZING RELAXANT DRUGS}

The rate of disappearance of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug from the blood is characterized by a rapid initial distribution phase followed by a slower elimination phase. Neuromuscular blocking drugs are high ionized and do not readily cross cell membranes. Therefore, their volume of distribution is only slightly larger than the blood volume ( $80-140 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ ).

The elimination half-life strongly correlates with the duration of action of nondepolarizing relaxants. Drugs that are excreted by the kidney typically have longer half-lives, leading to longer durations of action (> 60 minutes). Drugs eliminated by the liver tend to have shorter half-lives and durations of action (Table 27-1). All steroidal muscle relaxants are metabolized to their 3 -hydroxy, 17 -hydroxy, or 3,17 -dihydroxy products in the liver. The $\equiv$ hydroxy metabolites are usually $40-80 \%$ as potent as the parent drug. Under normal circumstances, metabolites are not formed in sufficient quantities to produce a significant degree of neuromuscular blockade during or after anesthesia. However, if the parent compound is administered for several days in the intensive care setting, the 3-hydroxy metabolite may accumulate and cause prolonged paralysis because it has a longer half-life than the parent compound. The remaining metabolites possess minimal neuromuscular blocking properties.

The intermediate-acting steroid muscle relaxants (eg, vecuronium and rocuronium) tend to be more dependent on biliary excretion or hepatic metabolism for their elimination. These muscle relaxants are more commonly used clinically than the long-acting steroid-based drugs (eg, pancuronium, pipecuronium).

Atracurium (Figure 27-4) is an intermediate-acting isoquinoline nondepolarizing muscle relaxant. In addition to hepatic metabolism, atracurium is inactivated by a form of spontaneous breakdown known as Hofmann elimination. The main breakdown products are laudanosine and a related quaternary acid, neither of which possesses neuromuscular blocking properties. Laudanosine is slowly metabolized by the liver and has a long elimination half-life (ie, 150 minutes). It readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, and high blood concentrations may cause seizures and an increase in the volatile anesthetic requirement. During surgical anesthesia, blood levels of laudanosine range from 0.2 to $1 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. However, with prolonged infusions of atracurium in the intensive care unit, laudanosine blood levels may exceed $5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$.

Atracurium has several stereoisomers, and one of the more potent isomers, cisatracurium, has been approve. for clinical use. It resembles atracurium but has even less dependence on hepatic inactivation, forms less laudanosine, and is less likely to release histamine. From the clinical perspective, cisatracurium has all the advantages of atracurium with fewer side effects. Therefore, cisatracurium has largely replaced atracurium in
clinical practice.
Mivacurium, another isoquinoline compound, has the shortest duration of action of all nondepolarizing muscle relaxants (Table 27-1). However, its onset of action is significantly slower than that of succinylcholine. In addition, the use of a larger dose to speed the onset can be associated with profound histamine release leading to hypotension, flushing, and bronchospasm. Clearance of mivacurium by plasma cholinesterase is rapid and independent of the liver or kidney (Table 27-1). However, because patients with renal failure often have decreased levels of plasma cholinesterase, the short duration of action of mivacurium may be prolonged in patients with impaired renal function.

\section*{DEPOLARIZING RELAXANT DRUGS}

The extremely short duration of action of succinylcholine ( $5-10$ minutes) is due to its rapid hydrolysis by cholinesterases (eg, butyrylcholinesterase and pseudocholinesterase) in the liver and plasma. Plasma cholinesterase metabolizes succinylcholine more rapidly than mivacurium, and consequently the duration of action of succinylcholine is shorter than that of mivacurium (Table 27-1). The primary metabolite, succinylmonocholine, is rapidly broken down to succinic acid and choline. Because plasma cholinesterase has ar enormous capacity to hydrolyze succinylcholine, only a small percentage of the original intravenous dose ever reaches the neuromuscular junction. There is little if any plasma cholinesterase at the motor end plate, and a succinylcholine-induced blockade is terminated by its diffusion away from the end plate into extracellular fluid. Therefore, circulating levels of plasma cholinesterase influence the duration of action of succinylcholine by determining the amount of the drug that reaches the motor end plate.

Neuromuscular blockade produced by succinylcholine and mivacurium can be prolonged in patients with a genetically abnormal variant of plasma cholinesterase. The dibucaine number is a measure of the ability of a patient to metabolize succinylcholine and can be used to identify at-risk patients. Under standardized test conditions, dibucaine inhibits the normal enzyme by $80 \%$ and the abnormal enzyme by only $20 \%$. Many genetic variants of plasma cholinesterase have been identified, though the dibucaine-related variants are the most important. Given the rarity of these genetic variants, plasma cholinesterase testing is not a routine clinical procedure.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

The interactions of drugs with the acetylcholine receptor-end plate channel have been described at the molecular level. Several modes of action of drugs on the receptor are illustrated in Figure 27-6.

Schematic diagram of the interactions of drugs with the acetylcholine receptor on the end plate channel (structures are purely symbolic). Top: The action of the normal agonist, acetylcholine, in opening the channel. Bottom, left: A nondepolarizing blocker, eg, rocuronium, is shown as preventing the opening of the channel when it binds to the receptor. Right: A depolarizing blocker, eg, succinylcholine, both occupying the receptor and blocking the channel. Normal closure of the channel gate is prevented and the blocker may move rapidly in and out of the pore. Depolarizing blockers may desensitiz the end plate by occupying the receptor and causing persistent depolarization. An additional effect of drugs on the end plate channel may occur through changes in the lipid environment surrounding the channel (not shown). General anesthetics and alcohols may impair neuromuscular transmission by this mechanism.

\section*{NONDEPOLARIZING RELAXANT DRUGS}

All the neuromuscular blocking drugs in use in the USA except succinylcholine are classified as nondepolarizing agents. Tubocurarine is considered the prototype neuromuscular blocker. When small doses of nondepolarizin muscle relaxants are administered, they act predominantly at the nicotinic receptor site by competing with acetylcholine. The least potent nondepolarizing relaxants (eg, rocuronium) have the fastest onset and the shortest duration of action. In larger doses, nondepolarizing drugs can enter the pore of the ion channel (Figure 27-1) to cause a more intense motor blockade. This action further weakens neuromuscular transmission and diminishes the ability of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (eg, neostigmine, edrophonium, pyridostigmine) to antagonize the effect of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.

Nondepolarizing relaxants can also block prejunctional sodium channels. As a result of this action, muscle relaxants interfere with the mobilization of acetylcholine at the nerve ending. One consequence of the surmountable nature of the postsynaptic blockade produced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants is the fact tha tetanic stimulation, by releasing a large quantity of acetylcholine, is followed by transient posttetanic facilitatior (ie, relief of blockade) of the twitch strength. An important clinical consequence of the same principle is the reversal of residual blockade by cholinesterase inhibitors. The characteristics of a nondepolarizing neuromusculi
blockade are summarized in Table 27-2 and Figure 27-7.

Muscle responses to different patterns of nerve stimulation used in monitoring skeletal muscle relaxation. The alterations
produced by a nondepolarizing blocker and depolarizing and desensitizing blockade by succinylcholine are shown. In the trai of four (TOF) pattern, four stimuli are applied at 2 Hz . The TOF ratio (TOF-R) is calculated from the strength of the fourth contraction divided by that of the first. In the double burst pattern, three stimuli are applied at 50 Hz , followed by a 700 ms rest period and then repeated. In the posttetanic potentiation pattern, several seconds of 50 Hz stimulation are applied, followed by several seconds of rest and then by single stimuli at a slow rate (eg, 0.5 Hz ). The number of detectable posttetanic twitches is the posttetanic count (PTC). (*, first posttetanic contraction.)

\section*{DEPOLARIZI NG RELAXANT DRUGS}

\section*{Phase I Block (Depolarizing)}

Succinylcholine is the only clinically useful depolarizing blocking drug. Its neuromuscular effects are like those o acetylcholine except that succinylcholine produces a longer effect at the myoneural junction. Succinylcholine reacts with the nicotinic receptor to open the channel and cause depolarization of the motor end plate, and this in turn spreads to the adjacent membranes, causing contractions of muscle motor units. Data from singlechannel recordings indicate that depolarizing blockers can enter the channel to produce a prolonged "flickering" of the ion conductance (Figure 27-8). Because succinylcholine is not metabolized effectively at the synapse, th depolarized membranes remain depolarized and unresponsive to subsequent impulses (ie, in a state of depolarizing block). Furthermore, because excitation-contraction coupling requires end plate repolarization ("repriming") and repetitive firing to maintain muscle tension, a flaccid paralysis results. This so-called phase I (depolarizing) block is thus augmented, not reversed, by cholinesterase inhibitors.

Action of succinylcholine on single-channel end plate receptor currents in frog muscle. Currents through a single AchR channel were recorded using the patch clamp technique. The upper trace was recorded in the presence of a low concentratic of succinylcholine; the downward deflections represent two openings of the channel and passage of inward (depolarizing) current. The lower trace was recorded in the presence of a much higher concentration of succinylcholine and shows prolonged "flickering" of the channel as it repetitively opens and closes or is "plugged" by the drug.

The characteristics of a depolarizing neuromuscular blockade are summarized in Table 27-2 and Figure 27-7.

\section*{Phase II Block (Desensitizing)}

With continued exposure to succinylcholine, the initial end plate depolarization decreases and the membrane becomes repolarized. Despite this repolarization, the membrane cannot easily be depolarized again because it i desensitized. The mechanism for this desensitizing phase is unclear, but some evidence indicates that channel block may become more important than agonist action at the receptor in phase II of succinylcholine's neuromuscular blocking action. Regardless of the mechanism, the channels behave as if they are in a prolonge closed state (Figure 27-7). Later in phase II, the characteristics of the blockade are nearly identical to those of nondepolarizing block (ie, a nonsustained twitch response to a tetanic stimulus) (Figure 27-7), with reversal by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKI NG DRUGS}

\section*{Skeletal Muscle Paralysis}

Before the introduction of neuromuscular blocking drugs, profound skeletal muscle relaxation for intracavitary operations could be achieved only by producing deep levels of anesthesia that are accompanied by profound depressant effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The adjunctive use of neuromuscular blockin drugs makes it possible to achieve adequate muscle relaxation for all types of surgical procedures without the cardiorespiratory depressant effects produced by deep anesthesia.

\section*{Assessment of Neuromuscular Transmission}

Monitoring the effect of muscle relaxants during surgery (and recovery following the administration of cholinesterase inhibitors) typically involves the use of a device that produces transdermal electrical stimulation of one of the peripheral nerves to the hand (or face) and recording of the evoked contractions (ie, twitches). Tr motor responses to different patterns of peripheral nerve stimulation are measured (Figure 27-7). The three most commonly used patterns include (1) single-twitch stimulation, (2) train-of-four (TOF) stimulation, and (3) tetanic stimulation. Two newer modalities are also available to monitor neuromuscular transmission: doubleburst stimulation and posttetanic count.

With single-twitch stimulation, a single supramaximal electrical stimulus is applied to a peripheral nerve at frequencies from 0.1 Hz to 1.0 Hz . The higher frequency is often used during induction and reversal to more accurately determine the peak (maximal) drug effect. TOF stimulation involves four successive supramaximal stimuli given at intervals of 0.5 second ( 2 Hz ). Each stimulus in the TOF causes the muscle to contract, and the relative magnitude of the response of the fourth twitch compared with the first twitch is the TOF ratio. With a depolarizing block, all four twitches are reduced in a dose-related fashion. With a nondepolarizing block, the TO ratio decreases ("fades") and is inversely proportional to the degree of blockade. During recovery from nondepolarizing block, the amount of fade decreases and the TOF ratio approaches 1.0. Fade in the TOF response after administration of succinylcholine signifies the development of a phase II block.

Tetanic stimulation consists of very rapid ( $30-100 \mathrm{~Hz}$ ) delivery of electrical stimuli for several seconds. During c nondepolarizing block (and a phase II block after succinylcholine), the response is not sustained and fade is observed. Fade in response to tetanic stimulation is normally considered a presynaptic event. However, the degree of fade depends primarily on the degree of neuromuscular blockade. During a partial nondepolarizing blockade, tetanic nerve stimulation is followed by an increase in the posttetanic twitch response, so-called posttetanic facilitation of neuromuscular transmission. During intense neuromuscular blockade, there is no
response to either tetanic or posttetanic stimulation. As the intensity of the block diminishes, the response to posttetanic twitch stimulation reappears. The time to reappearance of the first response to TOF stimulation is related to the posttetanic count.

The double-burst stimulation pattern is a newer mode of electrical nerve stimulation developed with the goal of allowing for manual detection of residual neuromuscular blockade when it is not possible to record the response to single-twitch, TOF, or tetanic stimulation. In this pattern, three nerve stimuli are delivered at 50 Hz followed by a 700 ms rest period and then, by two or three additional stimuli at 50 Hz . It is easier to detect fade in the responses to double-burst stimulation than to TOF stimulation. The absence of fade in response to double-bursi stimulation implies that clinically significant residual neuromuscular blockade does not exist.

\section*{NONDEPOLARIZING RELAXANT DRUGS}

During anesthesia, administration of tubocurarine, $0.1-0.4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV, initially causes motor weakness, followed by the skeletal muscles becoming flaccid and inexcitable to electrical stimulation (Figure 27-9). In general, larger muscles (eg, abdominal, trunk, paraspinous, diaphragm) are more resistant to blockade and recover more rapidly than smaller muscles (eg, facial, foot, hand). The diaphragm is usually the last muscle to be paralyzed. Assuming that ventilation is adequately maintained, no adverse effects occur. When administration c muscle relaxants is discontinued, recovery of muscles usually occurs in reverse order, with the diaphragm regaining function first. The pharmacologic effect of tubocurarine, $0.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} \mathrm{IV}$, usually lasts 45-60 minutes. However, subtle evidence of residual muscle paralysis detected using a neuromuscular monitor may last for another hour.

Neuromuscular blockade from tubocurarine during equivalent levels of isoflurane and halothane anesthesia in patients. Note that isoflurane augments the block far more than does halothane.

Potency and duration of action of the other nondepolarizing drugs are shown in Table 27-1. In addition to the
duration of action, the most important property distinguishing the nondepolarizing relaxants is the time to onse of effect, which determines how rapidly the patient's trachea can be intubated. Of the currently available nondepolarizing drugs, rocuronium (60-120 seconds) is the most rapid.

\section*{DEPOLARIZING RELAXANT DRUGS}

Following the administration of succinylcholine, $0.75-1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV, transient muscle fasciculations occur over the chest and abdomen within 30 seconds, although general anesthesia tends to attenuate them. As paralysis develops rapidly (< 90 seconds), the arm, neck, and leg muscles are initially relaxed followed by the respirator! muscles. As a result of succinylcholine's rapid hydrolysis by cholinesterase in the plasma and liver, the duration of neuromuscular block typically lasts less than 10 minutes (Table 27-1).

\section*{Cardiovascular Effects}

Vecuronium, pipecuronium, doxacurium, cisatracurium, and rocuronium all have minimal, if any, cardiovascular effects. The other nondepolarizing muscle relaxants (ie, pancuronium, atracurium, mivacurium) produce cardiovascular effects that are mediated by either autonomic or histamine receptors (Table 27-3). Tubocurarin and, to a lesser extent, metocurine, mivacurium, and atracurium can produce hypotension as a result of systemic histamine release, and with larger doses ganglionic blockade may occur with tubocurarine and metocurine. Premedication with an antihistaminic compound attenuates tubocurarine- and mivacurium-induced hypotension. Pancuronium causes a moderate increase in heart rate and a smaller increase in cardiac output, with little or no change in systemic vascular resistance. Although pancuronium-induced tachycardia is primarily due to a vagolytic action, release of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerve endings and blockade of neuronal uptake of norepinephrine may be secondary mechanisms. Although bronchospasm may be produced by neuromuscular blockers that release histamine (eg, mivacurium), insertion of a tracheal tube is the most common reason for bronchospasm after induction of general anesthesia.

Succinylcholine can cause cardiac arrhythmias when administered during halothane anesthesia. The drug stimulates autonomic cholinoceptors, including the nicotinic receptors at both sympathetic and parasympatheti، ganglia and muscarinic receptors in the heart (eg, sinus node). The negative inotropic and chronotropic responses to succinylcholine can be attenuated by administration of an anticholinergic drug (eg, glycopyrrolate, atropine). With large doses of succinylcholine, positive inotropic and chronotropic effects may be observed. On the other hand, bradycardia has been repeatedly observed when a second dose of succinylcholine is given less than 5 minutes after the initial dose. This transient bradycardia can be prevented by thiopental, atropine, ganglionic-blocking drugs, and even nondepolarizing muscle relaxants (eg, pancuronium). Direct myocardial effects, increased muscarinic stimulation, and ganglionic stimulation contribute to this bradycardic response.

\section*{Other Adverse Effects of Depolarizing Blockade}

\section*{HYPERKALEMIA}

Patients with burns, nerve damage or neuromuscular disease, closed head injury, and other trauma can respon to succinylcholine by releasing potassium into the blood, which, on rare occasions, results in cardiac arrest.

\section*{INCREASED INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE}

Administration of succinylcholine may be associated with the rapid onset of an increase in intraocular pressure (< 60 seconds), peaking at 2-4 minutes, and declining after 5 minutes. The mechanism may involve tonic contraction of myofibrils or transient dilation of ocular choroidal blood vessels. Despite the increase in intraocule pressure, the use of succinylcholine for ophthalmologic operations is not contraindicated unless the anterior chamber is open ("open globe") due to trauma.

\section*{INCREASED INTRAGASTRIC PRESSURE}

In heavily muscled patients, the fasciculations associated with succinylcholine may cause an increase in intragastric pressure ranging from 5 to $40 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, increasing the risk for regurgitation and aspiration of gastri contents. This complication is more likely to occur in patients with delayed gastric emptying (eg, those with diabetes), traumatic injury, esophageal dysfunction, and morbid obesity.

\section*{MUSCLE PAIN}

Myalgias are a common postoperative complaint of heavily muscled patients and those who receive large doses of succinylcholine. The true incidence of myalgias related to muscle fasciculations is difficult to establish becaus of confounding factors, including the type of surgery and positioning during the operation. However, the incidence of myalgias has been reported to vary from less than $1 \%$ to $20 \%$. It occurs more frequently in ambulatory than in bedridden patients. The pain is thought to be secondary to the unsynchronized contractions of adjacent muscle fibers just before the onset of paralysis. However, there is controversy over whether the incidence of muscle pain following succinylcholine is actually higher than with nondepolarizing muscle relaxants when other potentially confounding factors are taken into consideration.

\section*{Interactions with Other Drugs}

\section*{ANESTHETI CS}

Inhaled (volatile) anesthetics potentiate the neuromuscular blockade produced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants in a dose-dependent fashion. Of the general anesthetics that have been studied, volatile anesthetics augment the effects of muscle relaxants in the following order: isoflurane (most); sevoflurane, desflurane, enflurane, and halothane; and nitrous oxide (least) (Figure 27-9). The most important factors involved in this interaction are the following: (1) nervous system depression at sites proximal to the neuromuscular junction (it central nervous system); (2) increased muscle blood flow (ie, due to peripheral vasodilation produced by volatil anesthetics), which allows a larger fraction of the injected muscle relaxant to reach the neuromuscular junction and (3) decreased sensitivity of the postjunctional membrane to depolarization.

A rare interatction of succinylcholine with volatile anesthetics results in malignant hyperthermia, a condition caused by abnormal release of calcium from stores in skeletal muscle. This condition is treated with dantrolene and is discussed below under Spasmolytic Drugs and in Chapter 16.

\section*{ANTIBIOTICS}

Numerous reports have described enhancement of neuromuscular blockade by antibiotics (eg, aminoglycosides Many of the antibiotics have been shown to cause a depression of evoked release of acetylcholine similar to tha caused by magnesium. The mechanism of this prejunctional effect appears to be blockade of specific P-type calcium channels.

\section*{LOCAL ANESTHETICS AND ANTI ARRHYTHMIC DRUGS}

In small doses, local anesthetics depress posttetanic potentiation via a prejunctional neural effect. In large doses, local anesthetics can block neuromuscular transmission. With higher doses, local anesthetics block acetylcholine-induced muscle contractions as a result of blockade of the nicotinic receptor ion channels.

Experimentally, similar effects can be demonstrated with sodium channel-blocking antiarrhythmic drugs such as quinidine. However, at the doses used for cardiac arrhythmias, this interaction is of little or no clinical significance. Higher concentrations of bupivacaine ( $0.75 \%$ ) have been associated with cardiac arrhythmias independent of the muscle relaxant used.

\section*{OTHER NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKING DRUGS}

The end plate-depolarizing effect of succinylcholine can be antagonized by administering a small dose of a nondepolarizing blocker. To prevent the fasciculations associated with succinylcholine administration, a small nonparalyzing dose of a nondepolarizing drug can be given before succinylcholine (eg, d -tubocurarine 2 mg IV or pancuronium 0.5 mg IV). Although this dose usually reduces fasciculations and postoperative myalgias, it cal increase the amount of succinylcholine required for relaxation by $50-90 \%$ and can produce a feeling of weakness in awake patients. Therefore, "pre-curarization" before succinylcholine is no longer widely practiced.

\section*{Effects of Diseases \& Aging on the Neuromuscular Response}

Several diseases can diminish or augment the neuromuscular blockade produced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Myasthenia gravis enhances the neuromuscular blockade produced by these drugs. Advanced age is associated with a prolonged duration of action from nondepolarizing relaxants as a result of decreased clearanc of the drugs by the liver and kidneys. As a result, the dosage of neuromuscular blocking drugs should be reduced in elderly patients (> 70 years).

Conversely, patients with severe burns and those with upper motor neuron disease are resistant to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. This desensitization is probably caused by proliferation of extrajunctional receptors, which results in an increased dose requirement for the nondepolarizing relaxant to block a sufficient number of receptors.

\section*{Reversal of Nondepolarizing Neuromuscular Blockade}

The cholinesterase inhibitors effectively antagonize the neuromuscular blockade caused by nondepolarizing drugs. Their general pharmacology is discussed in Chapter 7. Neostigmine and pyridostigmine antagonize nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade by increasing the availability of acetylcholine at the motor end plate, mainly by inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. To a lesser extent, these cholinesterase inhibitors also increase release of transmitter from the motor nerve terminal. In contrast, edrophonium antagonizes neuromuscular blockade purely by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. Edrophonium may be less effective than neostigmine in reversing the effects of nondepolarizing blockers in the presence of a profound degree of neuromuscular blockade. These differences are important in determining recovery from residual block, the neuromuscular blockade remaining after completion of surgery and movement of the patient to the recovery room.
Unsuspected residual block may result in hypoventilation, leading to hypoxia and even apnea, especially if patients receive central depressant medications during the early recovery period.

Since mivacurium is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase, the interaction with the reversal drugs is less predictable. On the one hand, the neuromuscular blockade is antagonized because of increased acetylcholine concentrations in the synapse. On the other hand, mivacurium concentration may be higher because of decreased plasma cholinesterase breakdown of the muscle relaxant.

A novel cyclodextrin reversal drug, sugammadex, has been recently introduced. It can rapidly inactivate steroidal neuromuscular blocking drugs by forming an inactive complex, which is excreted in the urine. This chelation process allows the practitioner to rapidly reverse even profound degrees of neuromuscular blockade a the end of surgery.

\section*{Uses of Neuromuscular Blocking Drugs SURGICAL RELAXATION}

By far the most important application of the neuromuscular blockers is in facilitating intracavitary surgery. This especially important in intra-abdominal and intrathoracic procedures.

\section*{TRACHEAL INTUBATION}

By relaxing the pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles, neuromuscular blocking drugs facilitate laryngoscopy and placement of the tracheal tube. Placement of a tracheal tube ensures an adequate airway and minimizes the ris of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia.

\section*{CONTROL OF VENTILATION}

In critically ill patients who have ventilatory failure from various causes (eg, severe bronchospasm, pneumonia, chronic obstructive airway disease), it may be necessary to control ventilation to provide adequate gas exchange and to prevent atelectasis. Muscle paralysis is produced by neuromuscular blocking drugs to reduce chest wall resistance (ie, improve thoracic compliance) and ineffective spontaneous ventilation.

\section*{TREATMENT OF CONVULSIONS}

Neuromuscular blocking drugs are occasionally used to attenuate the peripheral manifestations of convulsions associated with status epilepticus or local anesthetic toxicity. Although this approach is effective in eliminating the muscular manifestations of the seizures, it has no effect on the central processes because neuromuscular blocking drugs do not cross the blood-brain barrier.

\section*{SPASMOLYTI C DRUGS}

Spasticity is characterized by an increase in tonic stretch reflexes and flexor muscle spasms (ie, increased basa muscle tone) together with muscle weakness. It is often associated with cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. These conditions often involve abnormal function of the bowel and bladder as well as skeletal muscle. The mechanisms underlying clinical spasticity appear to involve not only the stretch reflex arc itself but also higher centers in the central nervous system (ie, upper motor neuron lesion), with damage to descending pathways in the spinal cord resulting in hyperexcitability of the alpha motoneurons in the cord. Pharmacologic therapy may ameliorate some of the symptoms of spasticity by modifying the stretch reflex arc or by interferinc directly with skeletal muscle (ie, excitation-contraction coupling). The important components involved in these processes are shown in Figure 27-10.
Figure 27-10.

Drugs that modify this reflex arc may modulate excitatory or inhibitory synapses (see Chapter 21). Thus, to reduce the hyperactive stretch reflex, it is desirable to reduce the activity of the la fibers that excite the primar motoneuron or to enhance the activity of the inhibitory internuncial neurons. These structures are shown in greater detail in Figure 27-11.

Postulated sites of spasmolytic action of diazepam and baclofen in the spinal cord. (Reproduced, with permission, from Youn RR, Delwaide PJ: Drug therapy: Spasticity. N Engl J Med 1981; 304: 28.)

A variety of pharmacologic agents described as depressants of the spinal "polysynaptic" reflex arc (eg, barbiturates [phenobarbital] and glycerol ethers [mephenesin]) have been used to treat these conditions of excess skeletal muscle tone. However, as illustrated in Figure 27-11, nonspecific depression of synapses involved in the stretch reflex could reduce the desired inhibitory activity, as well as the excitatory transmission. Currently available drugs can provide significant relief from painful muscle spasms, but they are less effective ir improving meaningful function (eg, mobility and return to work).

\section*{DI AZEPAM}

As described in Chapter 22, benzodiazepines facilitate the action of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the central nervous system. Diazepam acts at $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ synapses, and its action in reducing spasticity is at least partly mediated in the spinal cord because it is somewhat effective in patients with cord transection. Although diazepam can be used in patients with muscle spasm of almost any origin (including local muscle trauma), it produces sedation at the doses required to reduce muscle tone. The initial dosage is $4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, and it is gradually increased to a maximum of $60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. Other benzodiazepines have been used as spasmolytics (eg, midazolam), but clinical experience with them is limited.

\section*{BACLOFEN}

Baclofen (p- chlorophenyl-GABA) was designed to be an orally active GABA-mimetic agent.
Baclofen exerts its spasmolytic activity at $G A B A_{B}$ receptors. Activation of these receptors by baclofen results in hyperpolarization, probably by increased $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance. It has been suggested that hyperpolarization causes presynaptic inhibition by reducing calcium influx (Figure 27-11) and reduces the release of excitatory transmitters in both the brain and the spinal cord. Baclofen may also reduce pain in patients with spasticity, perhaps by inhibiting the release of substance $P$ (neurokinin-1) in the spinal cord.
<smiles>NCC(CC(=O)O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1</smiles>

Baclofen

Baclofen is at least as effective as diazepam in reducing spasticity while producing less sedation. In addition, baclofen does not reduce overall muscle strength as much as dantrolene. It is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration and has a plasma half-life of $3-4$ hours. Dosage is started at 15 mg twice daily, increasing as tolerated to 100 mg daily. Adverse effects of this drug include drowsiness; however, patients become tolerant to the sedative effect with chronic administration. Increased seizure activity has been reportec in epileptic patients. Therefore, withdrawal from baclofen must be done very slowly.

Studies have confirmed that intrathecal administration of baclofen can control severe spasticity and muscle pair that is not responsive to medication by other routes of administration. Owing to the poor egress of baclofen frol the spinal cord, peripheral symptoms are rare. Therefore, higher central concentrations of the drug may be tolerated. Partial tolerance to the effect of the drug may occur after several months of therapy, but can be overcome by upward dosage adjustments to maintain the beneficial effect. Excessive somnolence, respiratory depression, and even coma have been described. Although a major disadvantage of this therapeutic approach i the difficulty of maintaining the drug delivery catheter in the subarachnoid space, long-term intrathecal baclofel therapy can improve the quality of life for patients with severe spastic disorders.

Oral baclofen has been studied in several other medical conditions. Preliminary studies suggest that it may be effective in reducing "craving" in recovering alcoholics (see Chapter 32). It has also been found to be effective i preventing migraine headaches in some patients.

\section*{TI ZANI DI NE}

As noted in Chapter 11, agonists such as clonidine and other imidazoline compounds have a variety of effects on the central nervous system that are not fully understood. Among these effects is the ability to reduce muscle spasm. Tizanidine is a congener of clonidine that has been studied for its spasmolytic actions. Tizanidine has significant $a_{2}$-adrenoceptor agonist effects, but it reduces spasticity in experimental models at doses that caus fewer cardiovascular effects than clonidine. Neurophysiologic studies in animals and humans suggest that tizanidine reinforces both presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition in the cord. It also inhibits nociceptive transmission in the spinal dorsal horn.

Clinical trials with oral tizanidine report comparable efficacy in relieving muscle spasm to diazepam, baclofen, and dantrolene. However, tizanidine produces a different spectrum of adverse effects, including drowsiness,
hypotension, dry mouth, and asthenia. The dosage requirements vary markedly among patients, suggesting that individual dosage titration is necessary to achieve an optimal clinical effect.

\section*{OTHER CENTRALLY ACTI NG SPASMOLYTI C DRUGS}

Gabapentin is an antiepileptic drug (see Chapter 24) that has shown considerable promise as a spasmolytic agent in several studies involving patients with multiple sclerosis. Pregabalin is a new analog of gabapentin that may also prove useful. Progabide and glycine have also been found in preliminary studies to reduce spasticit) Progabide is a GABA and GABA agonist and has active metabolites, including GABA itself. Glycine is another inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter (see Chapter 21). It appears to possess pharmacologic activity when given orally and readily passes the blood-brain barrier. Idrocilamide and riluzole are newer drugs for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that appear to have spasm-reducing effects, possibly through inhibition of glutamatergic transmission in the central nervous system.

\section*{DANTROLENE}

Dantrolene is a hydantoin derivative related to phenytoin that has a unique mechanism of spasmolytic activity. In contrast to the centrally acting drugs, dantrolene reduces skeletal muscle strength by interfering with excitation-contraction coupling in the muscle fibers. The normal contractile response involves release of calcium from its stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (see Figures 13-2 and 27-10). This activator calcium brings about the tension-generating interaction of actin with myosin. Calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum vic a calcium channel, called the ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel because the plant alkaloid ryanodine combines with a receptor on the channel protein. In the case of the skeletal muscle RyR channel, ryanodine facilitates the open configuration.
<smiles>O=C1CN(/N=C/c2ccc(-c3ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc3)o2)C(=O)N1</smiles>

Dantrolene

Dantrolene interferes with the release of activator calcium through this sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium channel by binding to the RyR and blocking the opening of the channel. Motor units that contract rapidly are more sensitive to the drug's effects than are slower-responding units. Cardiac muscle and smooth muscle are minimally depressed because the release of calcium from their sarcoplasmic reticulum involves a different RyR channel.

Treatment with dantrolene is usually initiated with 25 mg daily as a single dose, increasing to a maximum of 10 mg four times daily as tolerated. Only about one third of an oral dose of dantrolene is absorbed, and the elimination half-life of the drug is approximately 8 hours. Major adverse effects are generalized muscle weakness, sedation, and occasionally hepatitis.

A special application of dantrolene is in the treatment of malignant hyperthermia, a rare heritable disorder that can be triggered by a variety of stimuli, including general anesthetics (eg, volatile anesthetics) and neuromuscular blocking drugs (eg, succinylcholine; see also Chapter 16). Patients at risk for this condition have a hereditary impairment in the ability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum to sequester calcium (Figure 27-10). After administration of one of the triggering agents, there is a sudden and prolonged release of calcium, with massiv.
muscle contraction, lactic acid production, and increased body temperature. Prompt treatment is essential to control acidosis and body temperature and to reduce calcium release. The latter is accomplished with intravenous dantrolene, starting with a dose of $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV, and repeating as necessary to a maximum dose of $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$.

\section*{BOTULI NUM TOXI N}

The therapeutic use of botulinum toxin for ophthalmic purposes and for local muscle spasm was mentioned in Chapter 6. Local facial injections of botulinum toxin are widely used for the short-term treatment (1-3 months per treatment) of wrinkles around the eyes and mouth. Local injection of botulinum toxin has also become a useful treatment for generalized spastic disorders (eg, cerebral palsy). Most clinical studies to date have involved administration in one or two limbs, and the benefits appear to persist for weeks to several months afte a single treatment. Most studies have used type A botulinum toxin, but type B is also available.

\section*{DRUGS USED TO TREAT ACUTE LOCAL MUSCLE SPASM}

A large number of drugs (eg, carisoprodol, chlorphenesin, chlorzoxazone, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone methocarbamol, and orphenadrine ) are promoted for the relief of acute muscle spasm caused by local tiss. trauma or muscle strains. It has been suggested that these drugs act primarily at the level of the brainstem. Cyclobenzaprine may be regarded as the prototype of the group. Cyclobenzaprine is structurally related to the tricyclic antidepressants and possesses antimuscarinic effects. It is ineffective in treating muscle spasm due to cerebral palsy or spinal cord injury. The drug has strong antimuscarinic actions and may cause significant sedation, as well as confusion and transient visual hallucinations. The dosage of cyclobenzaprine for acute injury-related muscle spasm is $20-40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ in divided doses.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGI C MANAGEMENT OF PARKI NSONI SM \& OTHER MOVEMENT DI SORDERS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Several types of abnormal movement are recognized. Tremor consists of a rhythmic oscillatory movement around a joint and is best characterized by its relation to activity. Tremor at rest is characteristic of parkinsonism, when it is often associated with rigidity and an impairment of voluntary activity. Tremor may occur during maintenance of sustained posture (postural tremor) or during movement (intention tremor). A conspicuous postural tremor is the cardinal feature of benign essential or familial tremor. Intention tremor occurs in patients with a lesion of the brainstem or cerebellum, especially when the superior cerebellar peduncle is involved, and may also occur as a manifestation of toxicity from alcohol or certain other drugs.

Chorea consists of irregular, unpredictable, involuntary muscle jerks that occur in different parts of the body and impair voluntary activity. In some instances, the proximal muscles of the limbs are most severely affected, and because the abnormal movements are then particularly violent, the term ballismus has been used to describe them. Chorea may be hereditary or may occur as a complication of a number of general medical disorders and of therapy with certain drugs.

Abnormal movements may be slow and writhing in character (athetosis) and in some instances are so sustained that they are more properly regarded as abnormal postures (dystonia). Athetosis or dystonia may occur with perinatal brain damage, with focal or generalized cerebral lesions, as an acute complication of certain drugs, as an accompaniment of diverse neurologic disorders, or as an isolated inherited phenomenon of uncertain cause known as idiopathic torsion dystonia or dystonia musculorum deformans. Its physiologic basis is uncertain, and treatment is unsatisfactory.

Tics are sudden coordinated abnormal movements that tend to occur repetitively, particularly about the face and head, especially in children, and can be suppressed voluntarily for short periods of time. Common tics include repetitive sniffing or shoulder shrugging. Tics may be single or multiple and transient or chronic. Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome is characterized by chronic multiple tics; its pharmacologic management is discussed at the end of this chapter.

Many of the movement disorders have been attributed to disturbances of the basal ganglia, but the precise function of these anatomic structures is not yet fully understood, and it is not possible to relate individual symptoms to involvement at specific sites.

\section*{PARKI NSONI SM (PARALYSI S AGI TANS)}

Parkinsonism is characterized by a combination of rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, and postural instability that can occur for a variety of reasons but is usually idiopathic. The pathophysiologic basis of the idiopathic disorder may relate to exposure to some unrecognized neurotoxin or to the occurrence of oxidation reactions with the generation of free radicals. Studies in twins suggest that genetic factors may also be important, especially when the disease occurs in patients under age 50. Parkinson's disease is generally progressive, leading to increasing disability unless effective treatment is provided.

The normally high concentration of dopamine in the basal ganglia of the brain is reduced in
parkinsonism, and pharmacologic attempts to restore dopaminergic activity with levodopa and dopamine agonists have been successful in alleviating many of the clinical features of the disorder. An alternative but complementary approach has been to restore the normal balance of cholinergic and dopaminergic influences on the basal ganglia with antimuscarinic drugs. The pathophysiologic basis for these therapies is that in idiopathic parkinsonism, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra that normally inhibit the output of GABAergic cells in the corpus striatum are lost (Figure 28-1). (In contrast, Huntington's chorea involves the loss of some cholinergic neurons and an even greater loss of the GABAergic cells that exit the corpus striatum.) Drugs that induce parkinsonian syndromes either are dopamine receptor antagonists (eg, antipsychotic agents; see Chapter 29) or lead to the destruction of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons (eg, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6tetrahydropyridine [MPTP]; see below).

Figure 28-1.

\section*{LEVODOPA}

Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and if given into the peripheral circulation has no
therapeutic effect in parkinsonism. However, (-)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-l-alanine (levodopa), the immediate metabolic precursor of dopamine, does enter the brain (via an l-amino acid transporter, LAT), where it is decarboxylated to dopamine (see Figure 6-5). Several noncatecholamine dopamine receptor agonists have also been developed and may lead to clinical benefit, as discussed below.

Dopamine receptors are discussed in detail in Chapters 21 and 29. Dopamine receptors of the $D_{1}$ type are located in the zona compacta of the substantia nigra and presynaptically on striatal axons coming from cortical neurons and from dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra. The $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ receptors are located postsynaptically on striatal neurons and presynaptically on axons in the substantia nigra belonging to neurons in the basal ganglia. The benefits of dopaminergic antiparkinsonism drugs appear to depend mostly on stimulation of the $D_{2}$ receptors, but $D_{1}$-receptor stimulation may also be required for maximal benefit and one of the newer drugs is $\mathrm{D}_{3}$-selective. Dopamine agonist or partial agonist ergot derivatives such as lergotrile and bromocriptine that are powerful stimulators of the $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ receptors have antiparkinsonism properties, whereas certain dopamine blockers that are selective $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ antagonists can induce parkinsonism.

\section*{Chemistry}

As discussed in Chapter 6, dopa is the amino acid precursor of dopamine and norepinephrine. Its structure is shown in Figure 28-2. Levodopa is the levorotatory stereoisomer of dopa.

Some drugs used in the treatment of parkinsonism.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Levodopa is rapidly absorbed from the small intestine, but its absorption depends on the rate of gastric emptying and the pH of the gastric contents. Ingestion of food delays the appearance of levodopa in the plasma. Moreover, certain amino acids from ingested food can compete with the drug for absorption from the gut and for transport from the blood to the brain. Plasma concentrations usually peak between 1 and 2 hours after an oral dose, and the plasma half-life is usually between 1 and 3 hours, although it varies considerably among individuals. About two thirds of the dose appears in the urine as metabolites within 8 hours of an oral dose, the main metabolic products being 3-methoxy-4hydroxyphenyl acetic acid (homovanillic acid, HVA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC).

Unfortunately, only about 1-3\% of administered levodopa actually enters the brain unaltered; the remainder is metabolized extracerebrally, predominantly by decarboxylation to dopamine, which does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. This means that levodopa must be given in large amounts when it is used alone. However, when it is given in combination with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor that does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, the peripheral metabolism of levodopa is reduced, plasma levels of levodopa are higher, plasma half-life is longer, and more dopa is available for entry into the brain (Figure 28-3). Indeed, concomitant administration of a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor such as carbidopa may reduce the daily requirements of levodopa by approximately $75 \%$.

Fate of orally administered levodopa and the effect of carbidopa, estimated from animal data. The width of each pathway indicates the absolute amount of the drug at each site, whereas the percentages shown denote the relative proportion of the administered dose. The benefits of coadministration of carbidopa include reduction of the amount of levodopa diverted to peripheral tissues and an increase in the fraction of the dose that reaches the brain. (GI, gastrointestinal.)
(Data from Nutt J G, Fellman J H: Pharmacokinetics of levodopa. Clin Neuropharmacol 1984; 7:35.)

\section*{Clinical Use}

The best results of levodopa treatment are obtained in the first few years of treatment. This is
sometimes because the daily dose of levodopa must be reduced over time to avoid side effects at doses that were well tolerated at the outset. Some patients also become less responsive to levodopa, so that previously effective doses eventually fail to produce any therapeutic benefit. Responsiveness to levodopa may ultimately be lost completely, perhaps because of the disappearance of dopaminergic nigrostriatal nerve terminals or some pathologic process directly involving the striatal dopamine receptors. For such reasons, the benefits of levodopa treatment often begin to diminish after about 3 or 4 years of therapy regardless of the initial therapeutic response. Although levodopa therapy does not stop the progression of parkinsonism, its early initiation lowers the mortality rate. However, longterm therapy may lead to a number of problems in management such as the on-off phenomenon discussed below. The most appropriate time to introduce levodopa therapy must therefore be determined individually.

When levodopa is used, it is generally given in combination with carbidopa (Figure 28-2), a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, which reduces peripheral conversion to dopamine. Sinemet treatment is started with a small dose, eg, Sinemet-25/100 (carbidopa 25 mg , levodopa 100 mg ) three times daily, and gradually increased. It should be taken 30-60 minutes before meals. Most patients ultimately require Sinemet-25/250 (carbidopa 25 mg , levodopa 250 mg ) three or four times daily. It is generally preferable to keep treatment with this agent at a low level (eg, Sinemet-25/100 three times daily) and to increase dopaminergic therapy by the addition of a dopamine agonist, if necessary, to reduce the risk of development of response fluctuations. A controlled-release formulation of Sinemet is available and may be helpful in patients with established response fluctuations or as a means of reducing dosing frequency. A commercially available combination (Stalevo) of levodopa, carbidopa, and a catechol-Omethyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor (entacapone) is discussed in a later section.

Levodopa can ameliorate all of the clinical features of parkinsonism, but it is particularly effective in relieving bradykinesia and any disabilities resulting from it. When it is first introduced, about one third of patients respond very well and one third less well. Most of the remainder either are unable to tolerate the medication or simply do not respond at all.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

\section*{GASTROI NTESTI NAL EFFECTS}

When levodopa is given without a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, anorexia and nausea and vomiting occur in about $80 \%$ of patients. These adverse effects can be minimized by taking the drug in divided doses, with or immediately after meals, and by increasing the total daily dose very slowly; antacids taken 30-60 minutes before levodopa may also be beneficial. The vomiting has been attributed to stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone located in the brainstem but outside the blood-brain barrier. Fortunately, tolerance to this emetic effect develops in many patients. Antiemetics such as phenothiazines should be avoided because they reduce the antiparkinsonism effects of levodopa and may exacerbate the disease.

When levodopa is given in combination with carbidopa, adverse gastrointestinal effects are much less frequent and troublesome, occurring in less than $20 \%$ of cases, so that patients can tolerate proportionately higher doses.

\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS}

A variety of cardiac arrhythmias have been described in patients receiving levodopa, including
tachycardia, ventricular extrasystoles and, rarely, atrial fibrillation. This effect has been attributed to increased catecholamine formation peripherally. The incidence of such arrhythmias is low, even in the presence of established cardiac disease, and may be reduced still further if the levodopa is taken in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor.

Postural hypotension is common, but often asymptomatic, and tends to diminish with continuing treatment. Hypertension may also occur, especially in the presence of nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors or sympathomimetics or when massive doses of levodopa are being taken.

\section*{DYSKI NESI AS}

Dyskinesias occur in up to 80\% of patients receiving levodopa therapy for long periods. The form and nature of dopa dyskinesias vary widely among patients but tend to remain constant in character in individual patients. Choreoathetosis of the face and distal extremities is the most common presentation. The development of dyskinesias is dose-related, but there is considerable individual variation in the dose required to produce them.

\section*{BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS}

A wide variety of adverse mental effects have been reported, including depression, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, somnolence, confusion, delusions, hallucinations, nightmares, euphoria, and other changes in mood or personality. Such adverse effects are more common in patients taking levodopa in combination with a decarboxylase inhibitor rather than levodopa alone, presumably because higher levels are reached in the brain. They may be precipitated by intercurrent illness or operation. It may be necessary to reduce or withdraw the medication. Several atypical antipsychotic agents (clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone; see Chapter 29) are now available and may be particularly helpful in counteracting the behavioral complications of levodopa.

\section*{FLUCTUATIONS IN RESPONSE}

Certain fluctuations in clinical response to levodopa occur with increasing frequency as treatment continues. In some patients, these fluctuations relate to the timing of levodopa intake, and they are then referred to as wearing-off reactions or end-of-dose akinesia. In other instances, fluctuations in clinical state are unrelated to the timing of doses (on-off phenomenon). In the on-off phenomenon, off-periods of marked akinesia alternate over the course of a few hours with on-periods of improved mobility but often marked dyskinesia. The phenomenon is most likely to occur in patients who responded well to treatment initially. The exact mechanism is unknown. For patients with severe offperiods who are unresponsive to other measures, subcutaneously injected apomorphine may provide temporary benefit.

\section*{MISCELLANEOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS}

Mydriasis may occur and may precipitate an attack of acute glaucoma in some patients. Other reported but rare adverse effects include various blood dyscrasias; a positive Coombs test with evidence of hemolysis; hot flushes; aggravation or precipitation of gout; abnormalities of smell or taste; brownish discoloration of saliva, urine, or vaginal secretions; priapism; and mild-usually transient-elevations of blood urea nitrogen and of serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin.

\section*{Drug Holidays}

A drug holiday (discontinuance of the drug for 3-21 days) may temporarily improve responsiveness to levodopa and alleviate some of its adverse effects but is usually of little help in the management of the
on-off phenomenon. Furthermore, a drug holiday carries the risks of aspiration pneumonia, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and depression resulting from the immobility accompanying severe parkinsonism. For these reasons and because of the temporary nature of any benefit, drug holidays are no longer recommended.

\section*{Drug I nteractions}

Pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine (vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ ) enhance the extracerebral metabolism of levodopa and may therefore prevent its therapeutic effect unless a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor is also taken. Levodopa should not be given to patients taking monoamine oxidase A inhibitors or within 2 weeks of their discontinuance, because such a combination can lead to hypertensive crises.

\section*{Contraindications}

Levodopa should not be given to psychotic patients because it may exacerbate the mental disturbance. It is also contraindicated in patients with angle-closure glaucoma, but those with chronic open-angle glaucoma may be given levodopa if intraocular pressure is well controlled and can be monitored. It is best given combined with carbidopa to patients with cardiac disease; even so, the risk of cardiac dysrhythmia is slight. Patients with active peptic ulcer must also be managed carefully, since gastrointestinal bleeding has occasionally occurred with levodopa. Because levodopa is a precursor of skin melanin and conceivably may activate malignant melanoma, its use should be avoided in patients with a history of melanoma or with suspicious undiagnosed skin lesions.

\section*{DOPAMI NE RECEPTOR AGONISTS}

Drugs acting directly on dopamine receptors may have a beneficial effect in addition to that of levodopa. Unlike levodopa, they do not require enzymatic conversion to an active metabolite, have no potentially toxic metabolites, and do not compete with other substances for active transport into the blood and across the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, drugs selectively affecting certain (but not all) dopamine receptors may have more limited adverse effects than levodopa. A number of dopamine agonists have antiparkinsonism activity. The older dopamine agonists (bromocriptine and pergolide) are ergot (ergoline) derivatives (see Chapter 16), and their side effects are of more concern than those of the newer agents (pramipexole and ropinirole). There is no evidence that one agonist is superior to another; individual patients, however, may respond to one but not another of these agents. Apomorphine is a potent dopamine agonist but is discussed separately in a later section in this chapter because it is used primarily as a rescue drug for patients with disabling response fluctuations to levodopa.

Dopamine agonists have an important role as first-line therapy for Parkinson's disease, and their use is associated with a lower incidence of the response fluctuations and dyskinesias that occur with longterm levodopa therapy. In consequence, dopaminergic therapy may best be initiated with a dopamine agonist. Alternatively, a low dose of carbidopa plus levodopa (eg, Sinemet-25/100 three times daily) is introduced and a dopamine agonist is then added. In either case, the dose of the dopamine agonist is built up gradually depending on response and tolerance. Dopamine agonists may also be given to patients with parkinsonism who are taking levodopa and who have end-of-dose akinesia or on-off phenomenon or are becoming resistant to treatment with levodopa. In such circumstances, it is generally necessary to lower the dose of levodopa to prevent intolerable adverse effects. The response to a dopamine agonist is generally disappointing in patients who have never responded to levodopa.

\section*{Bromocriptine}

Bromocriptine is a $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ agonist; its structure is shown in Table 16-4. This drug has been widely used to treat Parkinson's disease and has also been used to treat certain endocrinologic disorders, especially hyperprolactinemia (see Chapter 37), but in lower doses than for parkinsonism. Bromocriptine is absorbed to a variable extent from the gastrointestinal tract; peak plasma levels are reached within 1-2 hours after an oral dose. It is excreted in the bile and feces. The usual daily dose of bromocriptine in the treatment of parkinsonism is between 7.5 and 30 mg , depending on response and tolerance. To minimize adverse effects, the dose is built up slowly over 2 or 3 months from a starting level of 1.25 mg twice daily after meals; the daily dose is then increased by 2.5 mg every 2 weeks depending on the response or the development of adverse reactions.

\section*{Pergolide}

Pergolide, another ergot derivative, directly stimulates both $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ receptors. It too has been widely used for parkinsonism, and comparative studies suggest that it is more effective than bromocriptine in relieving the symptoms and signs of the disease, increasing "on-time" among response fluctuators, and permitting the levodopa dose to be reduced. Because the use of pergolide has recently been associated with clinical or subclinical valvular heart disease in about one third of patients, one of the newer non-ergot agents is preferred when a dopamine agonist is required.

\section*{Pramipexole}

Pramipexole, which is not an ergot derivative, has preferential affinity for the $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ family of receptors. It is effective when used as monotherapy for mild parkinsonism. It is also helpful in patients with advanced disease, permitting the dose of levodopa to be reduced and smoothing out response fluctuations. It may ameliorate affective symptoms. A possible neuroprotective effect has been suggested by its ability to scavenge hydrogen peroxide and enhance neurotrophic activity in mesencephalic dopaminergic cell cultures.
<smiles>CCCNC1CCc2nc(N)sc2C1</smiles>

Pramipexole

Pramipexole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in approximately 2 hours, and is excreted largely unchanged in the urine. It is started at a dosage of 0.125 mg three times daily, doubled after 1 week, and again after another week. Further increments in the daily dose are by 0.75 mg at weekly intervals, depending on response and tolerance. Most patients require between 0.5 and 1.5 mg three times daily. Renal insufficiency may necessitate dosage adjustment.

\section*{Ropinirole}

Another nonergoline derivative, ropinirole is a relatively pure $D_{2}$ receptor agonist that is effective as monotherapy in patients with mild disease and as a means of smoothing the response to levodopa in patients with more advanced disease and response fluctuations. It is introduced at 0.25 mg three
times daily, and the total daily dose is then increased by 0.75 mg at weekly intervals until the fourth week and by 1.5 mg thereafter. In most instances, a dose of between 2 and 8 mg three times daily is necessary. Ropinirole is metabolized by CYP1A2; other drugs metabolized by this isoform may significantly reduce its clearance.

\section*{Ropinirole}

\section*{Adverse Effects of Dopamine Agonists}

\section*{GASTROI NTESTI NAL EFFECTS}

Anorexia and nausea and vomiting may occur when a dopamine agonist is introduced and can be minimized by taking the medication with meals. Constipation, dyspepsia, and symptoms of reflux esophagitis may also occur. Bleeding from peptic ulceration has been reported.

\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS}

Postural hypotension may occur, particularly at the initiation of therapy. Painless digital vasospasm is a dose-related complication of long-term treatment with the ergot derivatives (bromocriptine or pergolide). When cardiac arrhythmias occur, they are an indication for discontinuing treatment. Peripheral edema is sometimes problematic. Cardiac valvulopathy may occur with pergolide.

\section*{DYSKI NESI AS}

Abnormal movements similar to those introduced by levodopa may occur and are reversed by reducing the total dose of dopaminergic drugs being taken.

\section*{MENTAL DISTURBANCES}

Confusion, hallucinations, delusions, and other psychiatric reactions are other complications of dopaminergic treatment and are more common and severe with dopamine receptor agonists than with levodopa. They clear on withdrawal of the offending medication.

\section*{MI SCELLANEOUS}

Headache, nasal congestion, increased arousal, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural and retroperitoneal fibrosis, and erythromelalgia are other reported side effects of the ergot-derived dopamine agonists. Erythromelalgia consists of red, tender, painful, swollen feet and, occasionally, hands, at times associated with arthralgia; symptoms and signs clear within a few days of withdrawal of the causal drug. In rare instances, an uncontrollable tendency to fall asleep at inappropriate times has occurred, particularly in patients receiving pramipexole or ropinirole, requiring the discontinuation of medication.

\section*{Contraindications}

Dopamine agonists are contraindicated in patients with a history of psychotic illness or recent myocardial infarction, or with active peptic ulceration. The ergot-derived agonists are best avoided in patients with peripheral vascular disease.

\section*{MONOAMI NE OXI DASE I NHI BITORS}

Two types of monoamine oxidase have been distinguished in the nervous system. Monoamine oxidase A metabolizes norepinephrine and serotonin; monoamine oxidase B metabolizes dopamine. Selegiline (deprenyl) (Figure 28-2), a selective irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B at normal doses (at higher doses it inhibits MAO-A as well), retards the breakdown of dopamine; in consequence, it enhances and prolongs the antiparkinsonism effect of levodopa (thereby allowing the dose of levodopa to be reduced) and may reduce mild on-off or wearing-off phenomena. It is therefore used as adjunctive therapy for patients with a declining or fluctuating response to levodopa. The standard dose of selegiline is 5 mg with breakfast and 5 mg with lunch. Selegiline may cause insomnia when taken later during the day. It should not be taken by patients receiving meperidine, tricyclic antidepressants, or serotonin reuptake inhibitors because of the risk of acute toxic interactions of the serotonin syndrome type (see Chapter 16). The adverse effects of levodopa may be increased by selegiline.

Selegiline has only a minor therapeutic effect on parkinsonism when given alone, but studies in animals suggest that it may reduce disease progression. Such an effect of antioxidative therapy on disease progression may be expected if Parkinson's disease is associated with the oxidative generation of free radicals. However, any neuroprotective effect of selegiline may relate to its metabolite, desmethylselegiline, and involve antiapoptotic mechanisms. Studies to test the effect of selegiline on the progression of parkinsonism in humans have yielded ambiguous results. The findings in a large multicenter study have been taken to suggest a beneficial effect in slowing disease progression but may simply have reflected a symptomatic response.

Rasagiline, another monoamine oxidase B inhibitor, is more potent than selegiline in preventing MPTP-induced parkinsonism and is being used as a neuroprotective agent and for early symptomatic treatment. The standard dose is $0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$.

The combined administration of levodopa and an inhibitor of both forms of monoamine oxidase must be avoided, because it may lead to hypertensive crises, probably because of the peripheral accumulation of norepinephrine.

\section*{CATECHOL-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE INHIBITORS}

Inhibition of dopa decarboxylase is associated with compensatory activation of other pathways of levodopa metabolism, especially catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and this increases plasma levels of 3-0-methyldopa (30MD). Elevated levels of 30MD have been associated with a poor therapeutic response to levodopa, perhaps in part because 3OMD competes with levodopa for an active carrier mechanism that governs its transport across the intestinal mucosa and the blood-brain barrier. Selective COMT inhibitors such as tolcapone and entacapone also prolong the action of levodopa by diminishing its peripheral metabolism. Levodopa clearance is decreased, and relative bioavailability of levodopa is thus increased. Neither the time to reach peak concentration nor the maximal concentration of levodopa is increased. These agents may be helpful in patients receiving levodopa who have developed response fluctuations-leading to a smoother response, more prolonged "on-time," and the option of reducing total daily levodopa dose. Tolcapone and entacapone are both widely available, but entacapone is generally preferred because it has not been associated with hepatotoxicity.

The pharmacologic effects of tolcapone and entacapone are similar, and both are rapidly absorbed,
bound to plasma proteins, and metabolized prior to excretion. However, tolcapone has both central and peripheral effects, whereas the effect of entacapone is peripheral. The half-life of both drugs is approximately 2 hours, but tolcapone is slightly more potent and has a longer duration of action. Tolcapone is taken in a standard dosage of 100 mg three times daily; some patients require a daily dose of twice that amount. By contrast, entacapone ( 200 mg ) needs to be taken with each dose of levodopa, up to five times daily.

Adverse effects of the COMT inhibitors relate in part to increased levodopa exposure and include dyskinesias, nausea, and confusion. It is often necessary to lower the daily dose of levodopa by about $30 \%$ in the first 48 hours to avoid or reverse such complications. Other side effects include diarrhea, abdominal pain, orthostatic hypotension, sleep disturbances, and an orange discoloration of the urine. Tolcapone may cause an increase in liver enzyme levels and has been rarely associated with death from acute hepatic failure; accordingly, its use in the USA requires signed patient consent (as provided in the product labeling) plus monitoring of liver function tests every 2 weeks during the first year and less frequently thereafter. No such toxicity has been reported with entacapone.

A commercial preparation named Stalevo consists of a combination of levodopa with both carbidopa and entacapone. Use of this preparation simplifies the drug regimen and requires the consumption of a lesser number of tablets than otherwise; Stalevo is priced at or below the price of its individual components.

\section*{APOMORPHINE}

Subcutaneous injection of apomorphine hydrochloride (Apokyn), a potent dopamine agonist, is effective for the temporary relief of off-periods of akinesia in patients on dopaminergic therapy. It is rapidly taken up in the blood and then the brain, leading to clinical benefit that begins within about 10 minutes of injection and persists for up to 2 hours. The optimal dose is identified by administering increasing test doses until adequate benefit is achieved or a maximum of 10 mg is reached. Most patients require a dose of $3-6 \mathrm{mg}$, and this should be given no more than about three times daily.

Nausea is often troublesome, especially at the initiation of apomorphine treatment; accordingly, pretreatment with the antiemetic trimethobenzamide ( 300 mg three times daily) for 3 days is recommended before apomorphine is introduced and is then continued for at least 1 month, if not indefinitely. Other adverse effects include dyskinesias, drowsiness, sweating, hypotension, and bruising at the injection site.

\section*{AMANTADI NE}

Amantadine, an antiviral agent, was by chance found to have antiparkinsonism properties. Its mode of action in parkinsonism is unclear, but it may potentiate dopaminergic function by influencing the synthesis, release, or reuptake of dopamine. Release of catecholamines from peripheral stores has been documented.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Peak plasma concentrations of amantadine are reached 1-4 hours after an oral dose. The plasma halflife is between 2 and 4 hours, most of the drug being excreted unchanged in the urine.

\section*{Clinical Use}

Amantadine is less potent than levodopa, and its benefits may be short-lived, often disappearing after only a few weeks of treatment. Nevertheless, during that time it may favorably influence the bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor of parkinsonism. The standard dosage is 100 mg orally twice or three times daily. Amantadine may also help in reducing iatrogenic dyskinesias in patients with advanced disease.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Amantadine has a number of undesirable central nervous system effects, all of which can be reversed by stopping the drug. These include restlessness, depression, irritability, insomnia, agitation, excitement, hallucinations, and confusion. Overdosage may produce an acute toxic psychosis. With doses several times higher than recommended, convulsions have occurred.

Livedo reticularis sometimes occurs in patients taking amantadine and usually clears within a month after the drug is withdrawn. Other dermatologic reactions have also been described. Peripheral edema, another well-recognized complication, is not accompanied by signs of cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease and responds to diuretics. Other adverse reactions include headache, heart failure, postural hypotension, urinary retention, and gastrointestinal disturbances (eg, anorexia, nausea, constipation, and dry mouth).

Amantadine should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures or heart failure.

\section*{ACETYLCHOLI NE-BLOCKI NG DRUGS}

A number of centrally acting antimuscarinic preparations are available that differ in their potency and in their efficacy in different patients. Some of these drugs were discussed in Chapter 8. These agents may improve the tremor and rigidity of parkinsonism but have little effect on bradykinesia. Some of the more commonly used drugs are listed in Table 28-1.

Table 28-1. Some Drugs with Antimuscarinic Properties Used in Parkinsonism.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Drug & Usual Daily Dose (mg) \\
\hline Benztropine mesylate & 1-6 \\
\hline Biperiden & 2-12 \\
\hline Orphenadrine & 150-400 \\
\hline Procyclidine & 7.5-30 \\
\hline Trihexyphenidyl & 6-20 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Clinical Use}

Treatment is started with a low dose of one of the drugs in this category, the level of medication gradually being increased until benefit occurs or adverse effects limit further increments. If patients do not respond to one drug, a trial with another member of the drug class is warranted and may be successful.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

Antimuscarinic drugs have a number of undesirable central nervous system and peripheral effects (see Chapter 8). Dyskinesias occur in rare cases. Acute suppurative parotitis sometimes occurs as a complication of dryness of the mouth.

If medication is to be withdrawn, this should be accomplished gradually rather than abruptly to prevent acute exacerbation of parkinsonism. For contraindications to their use, see Chapter 8.

\section*{SURGI CAL PROCEDURES}

In patients with advanced disease that is poorly responsive to pharmacotherapy, worthwhile benefit may follow thalamotomy (for conspicuous tremor) or posteroventral pallidotomy. Ablative surgical procedures, however, are being replaced by functional, reversible lesions induced by high-frequency deep-brain stimulation, which has a lower morbidity.

Thalamic stimulation by an implanted electrode and stimulator is very effective for the relief of tremor, and stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus internus has yielded good results for management of the clinical fluctuation occurring in advanced parkinsonism. The anatomic substrate for such therapy is indicated in Figure 28-4. Such procedures are contraindicated in patients with secondary or atypical parkinsonism.

Figure 28-4.

Functional circuitry between the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus. The involved neurotransmitters are indicated. In Parkinson's disease, there is degeneration of the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, leading to overactivity in the indirect pathway (color) and increased glutamatergic activity by the subthalamic nucleus.

Transplantation of dopaminergic tissue (fetal substantia nigra tissue) has been reported to confer benefit in some parkinsonism patients, but the results are conflicting. In one controlled trial, symptomatic benefit occurred in younger (less than 60 years old) but not older patients. In another trial, benefits were inconsequential. Furthermore, uncontrollable dyskinesias occurred in some patients in both studies. This was attributed to a relative excess of dopamine from continued fiber outgrowth from the transplant. Further basic studies are required before other trials of cellular therapies are undertaken, and such approaches therefore remain investigational.

\section*{NEUROPROTECTIVE THERAPY}

A number of different compounds are under investigation as potential neuroprotective agents that may slow disease progression. These compounds include antioxidants, antiapoptotic agents, glutamate antagonists, intraparenchymally administered glial-derived neurotrophic factor, coenzyme Q10,
creatine, and anti-inflammatory drugs. The role of these agents remains to be established, however, and their use for therapeutic purposes is not indicated at this time.

\section*{GENERAL COMMENTS ON DRUG MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH PARKI NSONI SM}

Parkinson's disease generally follows a progressive course. Moreover, the benefits of levodopa therapy often diminish with time, and serious adverse effects may complicate long-term levodopa treatment. Nevertheless, dopaminergic therapy at a relatively early stage may be most effective in alleviating symptoms of parkinsonism and may also favorably affect the mortality rate due to the disease. Symptomatic treatment of mild parkinsonism is probably best avoided until there is some degree of disability or until symptoms begin to have a significant impact on the patient's lifestyle. When treatment becomes necessary, a trial of amantadine or an antimuscarinic drug (or both) may be worthwhile. With disease progression, dopaminergic therapy becomes necessary. This can conveniently be initiated with a dopamine agonist, either alone or in combination with low-dose Sinemet therapy. Physical therapy is helpful in improving mobility. In patients with severe parkinsonism and long-term complications of levodopa therapy such as the on-off phenomenon, a trial of treatment with a COMT inhibitor may be worthwhile. Regulation of dietary protein intake may also improve response fluctuations. Deep-brain stimulation may be helpful in patients who fail to respond adequately to these measures. Treating patients who are young or have mild parkinsonism with selegiline or rasagiline may delay disease progression and merits consideration.

\section*{DRUG-INDUCED PARKINSONISM}

Reserpine and the related drug tetrabenazine deplete biogenic monoamines from their storage sites, whereas haloperidol and the phenothiazines block dopamine receptors. These drugs may therefore produce a parkinsonian syndrome, usually within 3 months after introduction. This is related to high dosage and clears over a few weeks or months after withdrawal. If treatment is necessary, antimuscarinic agents are preferred. Levodopa is of no help if neuroleptic drugs are continued and may in fact aggravate the mental disorder for which antipsychotic drugs were prescribed originally.

In 1983, a drug-induced form of parkinsonism was discovered in individuals who attempted to synthesize and use a narcotic drug related to meperidine but actually synthesized and selfadministered MPTP, as discussed in MPTP \& Parkinsonism.

\section*{MPTP \& Parkinsonism}

Reports in the early 1980s of a rapidly progressive form of parkinsonism in young persons opened a new area of research in the etiology and treatment of parkinsonism. The initial report described apparently healthy young people who attempted to support their opioid habit with a meperidine analog synthesized by an amateur chemist. They unwittingly self-administered 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and subsequently developed a very severe form of parkinsonism.

MPTP is a protoxin that is converted by monoamine oxidase B to N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). MPP+ is selectively taken up by cells in the substantia nigra through an active mechanism normally responsible for dopamine reuptake. MPP+ inhibits mitochondrial complex I, thereby inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation. The interaction of MPP+ with complex I probably leads to cell death and thus to striatal dopamine depletion and parkinsonism.

Recognition of the effects of MPTP suggested that spontaneously occurring Parkinson's disease may result from exposure to an environmental toxin that is similarly selective in its target. However, no such toxin has yet been identified. It also suggested a successful means of producing an experimental model of Parkinson's disease in animals, especially nonhuman primates. This model is assisting in the development of new antiparkinsonism drugs. Pretreatment of exposed animals with a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor such as selegiline prevents the conversion of MPTP to MPP+ and thus protects against the occurrence of parkinsonism. This observation has provided one reason to believe that selegiline or rasagiline may retard the progression of Parkinson's disease in humans.

\section*{OTHER MOVEMENT DISORDERS}

\section*{Tremor}

Tremor consists of rhythmic oscillatory movements. Physiologic postural tremor, which is a normal phenomenon, is enhanced in amplitude by anxiety, fatigue, thyrotoxicosis, and intravenous epinephrine or isoproterenol. Propranolol reduces its amplitude and, if administered intra-arterially, prevents the response to isoproterenol in the perfused limb, presumably through some peripheral action. Certain drugs-especially the bronchodilators, valproate, tricyclic antidepressants, and lithium-may produce a dose-dependent exaggeration of the normal physiologic tremor that is reversed by discontinuing the drug. Although the tremor produced by sympathomimetics such as terbutaline (a bronchodilator) is blocked by propranolol, which antagonizes both $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ receptors, it is not blocked by metoprolol, a $B_{1}$-selective antagonist; this suggests that such tremor is mediated mainly by the $B_{2}$ receptors.

Essential tremor is a postural tremor, sometimes familial, which is clinically similar to physiologic tremor. Dysfunction of $B_{1}$ receptors has been implicated in some instances, since the tremor may respond dramatically to standard doses of metoprolol as well as to propranolol. The most useful approach is with propranolol, but whether the response depends on a central or peripheral action is unclear. The pharmacokinetics, pharmacologic effects, and adverse reactions of propranolol are discussed in Chapter 10. Daily doses of propranolol on the order of 120 mg (range, 60-240 mg) are usually required, and reported adverse effects have been few. Propranolol should be used with caution
in patients with heart failure, heart block, asthma, and hypoglycemia. Patients can be instructed to take their own pulse and call the physician if significant bradycardia develops. Metoprolol is sometimes useful in treating tremor when patients have concomitant pulmonary disease that contraindicates use of propranolol. Primidone (an antiepileptic drug; see Chapter 24), in gradually increasing doses up to 250 mg three times daily, is also effective in providing symptomatic control in some cases. Patients with tremor are very sensitive to primidone and often cannot tolerate the doses used to treat seizures; they should be started on 50 mg once daily and the daily dose increased by 50 mg every 2 weeks depending on response. Topiramate, another antiepileptic drug, may also be helpful in a dose of 400 mg daily, built up gradually. Small quantities of alcohol may suppress essential tremor but only for a short time and by an unknown mechanism. Alprazolam (in doses up to 3 mg daily) is helpful in some patients. Others are helped by intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin. Thalamic stimulation (discussed earlier) is often worthwhile in advanced cases refractory to pharmacotherapy. Diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, mephenesin, and antiparkinsonism agents have been advocated in the past but are generally worthless. Anecdotal reports of benefit from mirtazapine were not confirmed in a doubleblind study, which found no effect on the tremor in most patients.

Intention tremor is present during movement but not at rest; sometimes it occurs as a toxic manifestation of alcohol or drugs such as phenytoin. Withdrawal or reduction in dosage provides dramatic relief. There is no satisfactory pharmacologic treatment for intention tremor due to other neurologic disorders.

Rest tremor is usually due to parkinsonism.

\section*{Huntington's Disease}

Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder caused by an abnormality in chromosome 4. It is characterized by progressive chorea and dementia that usually begin in adulthood. The development of chorea seems to be related to an imbalance of dopamine, acetylcholine, GABA, and perhaps other neurotransmitters in the basal ganglia (Figure 28-1). Pharmacologic studies indicate that chorea results from functional overactivity in dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathways, perhaps because of increased responsiveness of postsynaptic dopamine receptors or deficiency of a neurotransmitter that normally antagonizes dopamine. Drugs that impair dopaminergic neurotransmission, either by depleting central monoamines (eg, reserpine, tetrabenazine) or by blocking dopamine receptors (eg, phenothiazines, butyrophenones), often alleviate chorea, whereas dopamine-like drugs such as levodopa tend to exacerbate it.

Both GABA and the enzyme (glutamic acid decarboxylase) concerned with its synthesis are markedly reduced in the basal ganglia of patients with Huntington's disease, and GABA receptors are usually implicated in inhibitory pathways. There is also a significant decline in concentration of choline acetyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for synthesizing acetylcholine, in the basal ganglia of these patients. These findings may be of pathophysiologic significance and have led to attempts to alleviate chorea by enhancing central GABA or acetylcholine activity. Unfortunately, such pharmacologic manipulations have been disappointing, yielding no consistently beneficial response. As a consequence, the most commonly used drugs for controlling dyskinesia in patients with Huntington's disease are still those that interfere with dopamine activity. With all the latter drugs, however, reduction of abnormal movements may be associated with iatrogenic parkinsonism.

Reserpine depletes cerebral dopamine by preventing intraneuronal storage (see Chapter 6); it is introduced in low doses (eg, 0.25 mg daily), and the daily dose is then built up gradually (eg, by 0.25 mg every week) until benefit occurs or adverse effects become troublesome. A daily dose of $2-5 \mathrm{mg}$ is often effective in suppressing abnormal movements, but adverse effects may include hypotension, depression, sedation, diarrhea, and nasal congestion. Tetrabenazine resembles reserpine in depleting cerebral dopamine and has less troublesome adverse effects, but it is not available in the USA. Treatment with postsynaptic dopamine receptor blockers such as phenothiazines and butyrophenones may also be helpful. Haloperidol is started in a small dose, eg, 1 mg twice daily, and increased every 4 days depending on the response. If haloperidol is not helpful, treatment with increasing doses of perphenazine up to a total of about 20 mg daily sometimes helps. Several recent reports suggest that olanzapine may also be useful; the dose varies with the patient, but 10 mg daily is often sufficient although doses as high as 30 mg daily are sometimes required. The pharmacokinetics and clinical properties of these drugs are considered in greater detail elsewhere in this book.

\section*{Other Forms of Chorea}

Treatment is directed at the underlying cause when chorea occurs as a complication of general medical disorders such as thyrotoxicosis, polycythemia vera rubra, systemic lupus erythematosus, hypocalcemia, and hepatic cirrhosis. Drug-induced chorea is managed by withdrawal of the offending substance, which may be levodopa, an antimuscarinic drug, amphetamine, lithium, phenytoin, or an oral contraceptive. Neuroleptic drugs may also produce an acute or tardive dyskinesia (discussed below). Sydenham's chorea is temporary and usually so mild that pharmacologic management of the dyskinesia is unnecessary, but dopamine-blocking drugs are effective in suppressing it.

\section*{Ballismus}

The biochemical basis of ballismus is unknown, but the pharmacologic approach to management is the same as for chorea. Treatment with haloperidol, perphenazine, or other dopamine-blocking drugs may be helpful.

\section*{Athetosis \& Dystonia}

The pharmacologic basis of these disorders is unknown, and there is no satisfactory medical treatment for them. Occasional patients with dystonia may respond to diazepam, amantadine, antimuscarinic drugs (in high dosage), levodopa, carbamazepine, baclofen, haloperidol, or phenothiazines. A trial of these pharmacologic approaches is worthwhile even though often not successful. Patients with focal dystonias such as blepharospasm or torticollis may benefit from injection of botulinum toxin into the overactive muscles.

\section*{Tics}

The pathophysiologic basis of tics is unknown. Chronic multiple tics (Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome) may require symptomatic treatment if the disorder is severe or is having a significant impact on the patient's life. The most effective pharmacologic approach is with haloperidol, and patients are better able to tolerate this drug if treatment is started with a small dosage (eg, 0.25 or 0.5 mg daily) and then increased very gradually over the following weeks. Most patients ultimately require a total daily dose of $3-8 \mathrm{mg}$. Adverse effects include extrapyramidal movement disorders, sedation, dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Pimozide, another dopamine-receptor antagonist, may be helpful in patients who are either unresponsive to or intolerant
of haloperidol. Treatment is started at $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, and the dosage is increased by 1 mg every 5 days; most patients require $7-16 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$.

If these measures fail, fluphenazine, clonazepam, clonidine, or carbamazepine should be tried. The pharmacologic properties of these drugs are discussed elsewhere in this book. Clonidine reduces motor or vocal tics in about $50 \%$ of children so treated. It may act by reducing activity in noradrenergic neurons in the locus caeruleus. It is introduced in a dose of $2-3 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$, increasing after 2 weeks to $4 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ and then, if required, to $5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$. It may cause an initial transient fall in blood pressure. The most common side effect is sedation; other side effects include reduced or excessive salivation and diarrhea. Phenothiazines such as fluphenazine sometimes help the tics, as do dopamine agonists. The role of the newer atypical antipsychotic agents, such as risperidone, is unclear.

Injection of botulinum toxin A at the site of problematic tics is sometimes helpful. Treatment of any associated attention deficit disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder may be required. Bilateral thalamic stimulation is sometimes worthwhile in otherwise intractable cases.

\section*{Drug-I nduced Dyskinesias}

The pharmacologic basis of the acute dyskinesia or dystonia sometimes precipitated by the first few doses of a phenothiazine is not clear. In most instances, parenteral administration of an antimuscarinic drug such as benztropine ( 2 mg intravenously), diphenhydramine ( 50 mg intravenously), or biperiden ( $2-5 \mathrm{mg}$ intravenously or intramuscularly) is helpful, whereas in other instances diazepam ( 10 mg intravenously) alleviates the abnormal movements.

Tardive dyskinesia, a disorder characterized by a variety of abnormal movements, is a common complication of long-term neuroleptic drug treatment (see Chapter 29). Unfortunately, its precise pharmacologic basis is unclear. A reduction in dose of the offending medication, a dopamine receptor blocker, commonly worsens the dyskinesia, whereas an increase in dose may suppress it. The drugs most likely to provide immediate symptomatic benefit are those interfering with dopaminergic function, either by depletion (eg, reserpine, tetrabenazine) or receptor blockade (eg, phenothiazines, butyrophenones). Paradoxically, the receptor-blocking drugs are the very ones that also cause the dyskinesia.

Because tardive dyskinesia that develops in adults is often irreversible and has no satisfactory treatment, care must be taken to reduce the likelihood of its occurrence. Antipsychotic medication should be prescribed only when necessary and should be withheld periodically to assess the need for continued treatment and to unmask incipient dyskinesia. Thioridazine, a phenothiazine with a piperidine side chain, is an effective antipsychotic that seems less likely than most to cause extrapyramidal reactions, perhaps because it has little effect on dopamine receptors in the striatal system. Finally, antimuscarinic drugs should not be prescribed routinely in patients receiving neuroleptics, because the combination may increase the likelihood of dyskinesia.

\section*{Restless Legs Syndrome}

Restless legs syndrome is characterized by an unpleasant creeping discomfort that seems to arise deep within the legs and occasionally the arms. Symptoms occur particularly when patients are relaxed, especially when they are lying down or sitting, and they lead to an urge to move about. Such symptoms may delay the onset of sleep. A sleep disorder associated with periodic movements during sleep may also occur. The cause is unknown, but the disorder is especially common among pregnant
women and also among uremic or diabetic patients with neuropathy. In most patients, no obvious predisposing cause is found.

Symptoms may resolve with correction of coexisting iron-deficiency anemia and often respond to dopamine agonists, levodopa, diazepam, clonazepam, or opiates. Dopaminergic therapy is the preferred treatment for restless legs syndrome and should be initiated with long-acting dopamine agonists to avoid the complications associated with levodopa. Ropinirole has recently been approved for this condition. When opiates are required, those with long half-lives or low addictive potential should be used.

\section*{Wilson's Disease}

A recessively inherited disorder of copper metabolism, Wilson's disease is characterized biochemically by reduced serum copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations, pathologically by markedly increased concentration of copper in the brain and viscera, and clinically by signs of hepatic and neurologic dysfunction. Neurologic signs include tremor, choreiform movements, rigidity, hypokinesia, and dysarthria and dysphagia. Treatment involves the removal of excess copper, followed by maintenance of copper balance. A commonly used agent for this purpose is penicillamine (dimethylcysteine), a chelating agent that forms a ring complex with copper. It is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and rapidly excreted in the urine. A common starting dose in adults is 500 mg three or four times daily. After remission occurs, it may be possible to lower the maintenance dose, generally to not less than 1 g daily, which must thereafter be continued indefinitely. Adverse effects include nausea and vomiting, nephrotic syndrome, a lupus-like syndrome, pemphigus, myasthenia, arthropathy, optic neuropathy, and various blood dyscrasias. Treatment should be monitored by frequent urinalysis and complete blood counts. Dietary copper should also be kept below 2 mg daily. Potassium disulfide, 20 mg three times daily with meals, reduces the intestinal absorption of copper and should also be prescribed.

For those patients who are unable to tolerate penicillamine, trientine, another chelating agent, may be used in a daily dose of 1-1.5 g. Trientine appears to have few adverse effects other than mild anemia due to iron deficiency in a few patients. Zinc acetate administered orally increases the fecal excretion of copper and is sometimes used for maintenance therapy. The dose is 50 mg three times a day. Zinc sulfate ( $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ orally) has also been used to decrease copper absorption. Zinc blocks copper absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by induction of intestinal cell metallothionein. Its main advantage is its low toxicity compared with that of other anticopper agents, although it may cause gastric irritation when introduced.
