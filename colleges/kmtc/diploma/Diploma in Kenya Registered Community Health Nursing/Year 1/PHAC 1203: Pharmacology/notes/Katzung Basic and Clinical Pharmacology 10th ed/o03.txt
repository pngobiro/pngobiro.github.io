\section*{Sodium Channel-Blocking Drugs (Class 1) PROCAI NAMI DE (SUBGROUP 1A)}

\section*{Cardiac Effects}

By blocking sodium channels, procainamide slows the upstroke of the action potential, slows conduction, and prolongs the QRS duration of the ECG. The drug also prolongs the action potential duration by nonspecific blockade of potassium channels. The drug may be somewhat less effective than quinidine (see below) in suppressing abnormal ectopic pacemaker activity but more effective in blocking sodium channels in depolarized cells.
<smiles>CCN(CC)CCNC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1</smiles>

Procainamide

Procainamide has directly depressant actions on sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes that are only slightly counterbalanced by drug-induced vagal block.

\section*{Extracardiac Effects}

Procainamide has ganglion-blocking properties. This action reduces peripheral vascular resistance and can cause hypotension, particularly with intravenous use. However, in therapeutic concentrations, its peripheral vascular effects are less prominent than those of quinidine. Hypotension is usually associated with excessively rapid procainamide infusion or the presence of severe underlying left ventricular dysfunction.

\section*{Toxicity}

\section*{CARDIAC}

Procainamide's cardiotoxic effects include excessive action potential prolongation, QT interval prolongation, and induction of torsade de pointes arrhythmia and syncope. Excessive slowing of conduction can also occur. New arrhythmias can be precipitated.

\section*{EXTRACARDIAC}

The most troublesome adverse effect of long-term procainamide therapy is a syndrome resembling lupus erythematosus and usually consisting of arthralgia and arthritis. In some patients, pleuritis, pericarditis, or parenchymal pulmonary disease also occurs. Renal lupus is rarely induced by procainamide. During long-term therapy, serologic abnormalities (eg, increased antinuclear antibody titer) occur in nearly all patients, and in the absence of symptoms these are not an indication to stop drug therapy. Approximately one third of patients receiving long-term procainamide therapy develop these reversible lupus-related symptoms.

Other adverse effects include nausea and diarrhea (about 10\% of cases), rash, fever, hepatitis (< 5\%), and agranulocytosis (approximately $0.2 \%$ ).

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

Procainamide can be administered safely by the intravenous and intramuscular routes and is well absorbed orally. A metabolite ( N -acetylprocainamide, NAPA) has class 3 activity. Excessive accumulation of NAPA has
been implicated in torsade de pointes during procainamide therapy, especially in patients with renal failure. Some individuals rapidly acetylate procainamide and develop high levels of NAPA. The lupus syndrome appears to be less common in these patients.

Procainamide is eliminated by hepatic metabolism to NAPA and by renal elimination. Its half-life is only 3-4 hours, which necessitates frequent dosing or use of a slow-release formulation (the usual practice). NAPA is eliminated by the kidneys. Thus, procainamide dosage must be reduced in patients with renal failure. The reduced volume of distribution and renal clearance associated with heart failure also require reduction in dosage. The half-life of NAPA is considerably longer than that of procainamide, and it therefore accumulates more slowly. Thus, it is important to measure plasma levels of both procainamide and NAPA, especially in patients with circulatory or renal impairment.

If a rapid procainamide effect is needed, an intravenous loading dose of up to $12 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ can be given at a rate of $0.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ or less rapidly. This dose is followed by a maintenance dosage of $2-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$, with careful monitoring of plasma levels. The risk of gastrointestinal or cardiac toxicity rises at plasma concentrations greater than $8 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ or NAPA concentrations greater than $20 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$.

In order to control ventricular arrhythmias, a total procainamide dosage of $2-5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ is usually required. In an occasional patient who accumulates high levels of NAPA, less frequent dosing may be possible. This is also possible in renal disease, where procainamide elimination is slowed.

\section*{Therapeutic Use}

Procainamide is effective against most atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. However, many clinicians attempt to avoid long-term therapy because of the requirement for frequent dosing and the common occurrence of lupusrelated effects. Procainamide is the drug of second choice (after lidocaine) in most coronary care units for the treatment of sustained ventricular arrhythmias associated with acute myocardial infarction.

\section*{QUINIDINE (SUBGROUP 1A)}

\section*{Cardiac Effects}

Quinidine has actions similar to those of procainamide: it slows the upstroke of the action potential and conduction, and prolongs the QRS duration of the ECG, by blockade of sodium channels. The drug also prolongs the action potential duration by nonspecific blockade of potassium channels. It has more pronounced cardiac antimuscarinic effects than procainamide. Its toxic cardiac effects include excessive QT interval prolongation and induction of torsade de pointes arrhythmia. Toxic concentrations of quinidine also produce excessive sodium channel blockade with slowed conduction throughout the heart.
<smiles>C=CC1=CN2CCC1CC2C(O)c1ccnc2ccc(OC)cc12</smiles>

Extracardiac Effects

Gastrointestinal side effects of diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting are observed in one third to one half of patients. A syndrome of headache, dizziness, and tinnitus (cinchonism) is observed at toxic drug concentrations. Idiosyncratic or immunologic reactions, including thrombocytopenia, hepatitis, angioneurotic edema, and fever, are observed rarely.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Quinidine is absorbed readily following oral administration, bound to albumin and $\alpha_{1}$-acid glycoprotein, and eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism. The elimination half-life is $6-8$ hours. Quinidine is usually administered in a slow release formulation, eg, that of the gluconate salt.

\section*{Therapeutic Use}

Quinidine is used only occasionally to maintain normal sinus rhythm in patients with atrial flutter/fibrillation. Because of its cardiac and extracardiac side effects, its use is now largely restricted to patients with normal (but arrhythmic) hearts. In randomized, controlled clinical trials, quinidine-treated patients are twice as likely to remain in normal sinus rhythm compared with controls, but the risk of death is increased two- to threefold. Quinidine is used rarely in patients with ventricular tachycardia. Quinidine is the optical isomer of quinine and is sometimes used intravenously for the treatment of acute, severe malaria (see Chapter 53).

\section*{DISOPYRAMI DE (SUBGROUP 1A)}

\section*{Cardiac Effects}

The effects of disopyramide are very similar to those of procainamide and quinidine. Its cardiac antimuscarinic effects are even more marked than those of quinidine. Therefore, a drug that slows atrioventricular conduction should be administered with disopyramide when treating atrial flutter or fibrillation.
<smiles>CC(C)N(CCC(C(N)=O)(c1ccccc1)c1ccccn1)C(C)C</smiles>

\section*{Disopyramide}

\section*{Toxicity}

\section*{CARDIAC}

Toxic concentrations of disopyramide can precipitate all of the electrophysiologic disturbances described under quinidine. As a result of its negative inotropic effect, disopyramide may precipitate heart failure de novo or in patients with preexisting depression of left ventricular function. Because of this effect, disopyramide is not used as a first-line antiarrhythmic agent in the USA. It should not be used in patients with heart failure.

\section*{EXTRACARDI AC}

Disopyramide's atropine-like activity accounts for most of its symptomatic adverse effects: urinary retention (most often, but not exclusively, in male patients with prostatic hyperplasia), dry mouth, blurred vision,
constipation, and worsening of preexisting glaucoma. These effects may require discontinuation of the drug.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

In the USA, disopyramide is only available for oral use. The usual oral dosage of disopyramide is 150 mg three times a day, but as much as $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ has been used. In patients with renal impairment, dosage must be reduced. Because of the danger of precipitating heart failure, the use of loading doses is not recommended.

\section*{Therapeutic Use}

Although disopyramide has been shown to be effective in a variety of supraventricular arrhythmias, in the USA it is approved only for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias.

\section*{LI DOCAI NE (SUBGROUP 1B)}

Lidocaine has a low incidence of toxicity and a high degree of effectiveness in arrhythmias associated with acute myocardial infarction. It is used only by the intravenous route.
<smiles>CCN(CC)CC(=O)Nc1c(C)cccc1C</smiles>

\section*{Lidocaine}

\section*{Cardiac Effects}

Lidocaine blocks activated and inactivated sodium channels with rapid kinetics (Figure 14-9); the inactivated state block ensures greater effects on cells with long action potentials such as Purkinje and ventricular cells, compared with atrial cells. The rapid kinetics at normal resting potentials result in recovery from block between action potentials and no effect on conduction. The increased inactivation and slower unbinding kinetics result in the selective depression of conduction in depolarized cells.
Figure 14-9.

Computer simulation of the effect of resting membrane potential on the blocking and unblocking of sodium channels by lidocaine. Upper tracing: Action potentials in a ventricular muscle cell. Lower tracing: Percentage of channels blocked by the drug. As the membrane depolarizes through $-80,-75$, and -70 mV , an 800 ms time segment is shown. Extra passage of time is indicated by breaks in the traces. Left side: At the normal resting potential of -85 mV , the drug combines with open (activated) and inactivated channels during each action potential, but block is rapidly reversed during diastole because the affinity of the drug for its receptor is so low when the channel recovers to the resting state at -85 mV . Middle: Metabolic injury has occurred, eg, ischemia due to coronary occlusion, that causes gradual depolarization over time. With subsequent action potentials arising from more depolarized potentials, the fraction of channels blocked increases because more channels remain in the inactivated state at less negative potentials (Figure 14-4, left), and the time constant for unblocking during diastole rapidly increases at less negative resting potentials (Figure 14-4, right). Right: Because of marked drug binding, conduction block and loss of excitability in this tissue result; that is, the "sick" (depolarized) tissue is selectively suppressed.

\section*{Toxicity}

\section*{CARDIAC}

Lidocaine is one of the least cardiotoxic of the currently used sodium channel blockers. Proarrhythmic effects, including sinoatrial node arrest, worsening of impaired conduction, and ventricular arrhythmias, are uncommon with lidocaine use. In large doses, especially in patients with preexisting heart failure, lidocaine may cause hypotension-partly by depressing myocardial contractility.

\section*{EXTRACARDIAC}

Lidocaine's most common adverse effects—like those of other local anesthetics—are neurologic: paresthesias, tremor, nausea of central origin, lightheadedness, hearing disturbances, slurred speech, and convulsions. These occur most commonly in elderly or otherwise vulnerable patients or when a bolus of the drug is given too rapidly. The effects are dose-related and usually short-lived; seizures respond to intravenous diazepam. In general, if plasma levels above $9 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ are avoided, lidocaine is well tolerated.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

Because of its extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism, only $3 \%$ of orally administered lidocaine appears in the plasma. Thus, lidocaine must be given parenterally. Lidocaine has a half-life of 1-2 hours. In adults, a loading dose of 150-200 mg administered over about 15 minutes (as a single infusion or as a series of slow boluses) should be followed by a maintenance infusion of $2-4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$ to achieve a therapeutic plasma level of 2-6 $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$. Determination of lidocaine plasma levels is of great value in adjusting the infusion rate. Occasional patients with myocardial infarction or other acute illness require (and tolerate) higher concentrations. This may be due to increased plasma $a_{1}$-acid glycoprotein, an acute phase reactant protein that binds lidocaine, making less free drug available to exert its pharmacologic effects.

In patients with heart failure, lidocaine's volume of distribution and total body clearance may both be decreased. Thus, both loading and maintenance doses should be decreased. Since these effects counterbalance each other, the half-life may not be increased as much as predicted from clearance changes alone. In patients with liver disease, plasma clearance is markedly reduced and the volume of distribution is often increased; the elimination half-life in such cases may be increased threefold or more. In liver disease, the maintenance dose should be decreased, but usual loading doses can be given. Elimination half-life determines the time to steady state. Thus, while steady-state concentrations may be achieved in 8-10 hours in normal patients and patients with heart failure, 24-36 hours may be required in those with liver disease. Drugs that decrease liver blood flow (eg, propranolol, cimetidine) reduce lidocaine clearance and so increase the risk of toxicity unless infusion rates are decreased. With infusions lasting more than 24 hours, clearance falls and plasma concentrations rise. Renal disease has no major effect on lidocaine disposition.

\section*{Therapeutic Use}

Lidocaine is the agent of choice for termination of ventricular tachycardia and prevention of ventricular fibrillation after cardioversion in the setting of acute ischemia. However, routine prophylactic use of lidocaine in this setting may actually increase total mortality, possibly by increasing the incidence of asystole, and is not the standard of care. Most physicians administer IV lidocaine only to patients with arrhythmias.

\section*{MEXI LETI NE (SUBGROUP 1B)}

Mexiletine is an orally active congener of lidocaine. Its electrophysiologic and antiarrhythmic actions are similar to those of lidocaine. (The anticonvulsant phenytoin [see Chapter 24] also exerts similar electrophysiologic effects and has been used as an antiarrhythmic.) Mexiletine is used in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. The elimination half-life is $8-20$ hours and permits administration two or three times a day. The usual daily dosage of mexiletine is $600-1200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$. Dose-related adverse effects are seen frequently at therapeutic dosage. These are predominantly neurologic, including tremor, blurred vision, and lethargy. Nausea is also a common effect.
<smiles>Cc1cccc(C)c1OCC(C)N</smiles>

\section*{Mexiletine}

Mexiletine has also shown significant efficacy in relieving chronic pain, especially pain due to diabetic neuropathy and nerve injury. The usual dosage is $450-750 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ orally. This application is unlabeled.

\section*{FLECAINIDE (SUBGROUP 1C)}

Flecainide is a potent blocker of sodium and potassium channels with slow unblocking kinetics. (Note that although it does block certain potassium channels, it does not prolong the action potential or the QT interval.) It is currently used for patients with otherwise normal hearts who have supraventricular arrhythmias. It has no antimuscarinic effects.
<smiles>O=C(NCC1CCCCN1)c1cc(OCC(F)(F)F)ccc1OCC(F)(F)F</smiles>

\section*{Flecainide}

Flecainide is very effective in suppressing premature ventricular contractions. However, it may cause severe exacerbation of arrhythmia even when normal doses are administered to patients with preexisting ventricular tachyarrhythmias and those with a previous myocardial infarction and ventricular ectopy. This was dramatically demonstrated in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), which was terminated prematurely because of a two and one-half-fold increase in mortality in the patients receiving flecainide and similar Group 1c drugs. Flecainide is well absorbed and has a half-life of approximately 20 hours. Elimination is both by hepatic metabolism and by the kidney. The usual dosage of flecainide is $100-200 \mathrm{mg}$ twice a day.

\section*{PROPAFENONE (SUBGROUP 1C)}

Propafenone has some structural similarities to propranolol and possesses weak B-blocking activity. Its spectrum of action is very similar to that of quinidine. Its sodium channel blocking kinetics are similar to that of flecainide. Propafenone is metabolized in the liver, with an average half-life of 5-7 hours. The usual daily dosage of propafenone is $450-900 \mathrm{mg}$ in three doses. The drug is used primarily for supraventricular arrhythmias. The most common adverse effects are a metallic taste and constipation; arrhythmia exacerbation can occur.

\section*{MORICIZINE (SUBGROUP 1C)}

Moricizine is an antiarrhythmic phenothiazine derivative that is used for treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. It is a relatively potent sodium channel blocker that does not prolong action potential duration.

Moricizine has multiple metabolites, some of which are probably active and have long half-lives. Its most common adverse effects are dizziness and nausea. Like other potent sodium channel blockers, it can exacerbate arrhythmias. The usual dosage of moricizine is $200-300 \mathrm{mg}$ by mouth three times a day.

\section*{Beta-Adrenoceptor- Blocking Drugs ( Class 2)}

\section*{Cardiac Effects}

Propranolol and similar drugs have antiarrhythmic properties by virtue of their B-receptor-blocking action and direct membrane effects. As described in Chapter 10, some of these drugs have selectivity for cardiac $B_{1}$ receptors, some have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, some have marked direct membrane effects, and some prolong the cardiac action potential. The relative contributions of the B-blocking and direct membrane effects to the antiarrhythmic effects of these drugs are not fully known. Although Bblockers are fairly well
tolerated, their efficacy for suppression of ventricular ectopic depolarizations is lower than that of sodium channel blockers. However, there is good evidence that these agents can prevent recurrent infarction and sudden death in patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction (see Chapter 10).

Esmolol is a short-acting Bblocker used primarily as an antiarrhythmic drug for intraoperative and other acute arrhythmias. See Chapter 10 for more information. Sotalol is a nonselective $B$-blocking drug that prolongs the action potential (class 3 action).

\section*{Drugs That Prolong Effective Refractory Period by Prolonging Action Potential (Class 3)}

These drugs prolong action potentials, usually by blocking potassium channels in cardiac muscle or by enhancing inward current, eg, through sodium channels. Action potential prolongation by most of these drugs often exhibits the undesirable property of "reverse use-dependence": action potential prolongation is least marked at fast rates (where it is desirable) and most marked at slow rates, where it can contribute to the risk of torsade de pointes.

\section*{AMI ODARONE}

In the USA, amiodarone is approved for oral and intravenous use to treat serious ventricular arrhythmias. However, the drug is also highly effective for the treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone has a broad spectrum of cardiac actions, unusual pharmacokinetics, and important extracardiac adverse effects.
<smiles>CCCCc1oc2ccccc2c1C(=O)c1cc(I)c(OCCN(C)CC)c(I)c1</smiles>

Amiodarone

\section*{Cardiac Effects}

Amiodarone markedly prolongs the action potential duration (and the QT interval on the ECG) by blockade of $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Kr}}$. During chronic administration, $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Ks}}$ is also blocked. The action potential duration is prolonged uniformly over a wide range of heart rates; that is, the drug does not have reverse use-dependent action. In spite of its present classification as a class 3 agent, amiodarone also significantly blocks inactivated sodium channels. Its action potential prolonging action reinforces this effect. Amiodarone also has weak adrenergic and calcium channel blocking actions. Consequences of these actions include slowing of the heart rate and atrioventricular node conduction. The broad spectrum of actions may account for its relatively high efficacy and low incidence of torsade de pointes despite significant QT interval prolongation.

\section*{Extracardiac Effects}

Amiodarone causes peripheral vasodilation. This action is prominent following intravenous administration and may be related to the action of the vehicle.

\section*{Toxicity}

\section*{CARDIAC}

Amiodarone may produce symptomatic bradycardia and heart block in patients with preexisting sinus or atrioventricular node disease.

\section*{EXTRACARDIAC}

Amiodarone accumulates in many tissues, including the heart (10-50 times greater than plasma), lung, liver, and skin, and is concentrated in tears. Dose-related pulmonary toxicity is the most important adverse effect. Even on a low dose of $5200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$, fatal pulmonary fibrosis may be observed in 1\% of patients. Abnormal liver function tests and hepatitis may develop during amiodarone treatment. The skin deposits result in a photodermatitis and a gray-blue skin discoloration in sun-exposed areas, eg, the malar regions. After a few weeks of treatment, asymptomatic corneal microdeposits are present in virtually all patients treated with amiodarone. Halos develop in the peripheral visual fields of some patients. Drug discontinuation is usually not required. Rarely, an optic neuritis may progress to blindness.

Amiodarone blocks the peripheral conversion of thyroxine ( $T_{4}$ ) to triiodothyronine ( $T_{3}$ ). It is also a potential source of large amounts of inorganic iodine. Amiodarone may result in hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Thyroid function should be evaluated prior to initiation of treatment and monitored periodically. Because effects have been described in virtually every organ system, amiodarone treatment should be reevaluated whenever new symptoms develop in a patient, including arrhythmia aggravation.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Amiodarone is variably absorbed with a bioavailability of 35-65\%. It undergoes hepatic metabolism, and the major metabolite, desethylamiodarone, is bioactive. The elimination half-life is complex, with a rapid component of 3-10 days (50\% of the drug) and a slower component of several weeks. Following discontinuation of the drug, effects are maintained for 1-3 months. Measurable tissue levels may be observed up to 1 year after discontinuation. A total loading dose of 10 g is usually achieved with $0.8-1.2 \mathrm{~g}$ daily doses. The maintenance dose is $200-400 \mathrm{mg}$ daily. Pharmacologic effects may be achieved rapidly by intravenous loading. QT-prolonging effect is modest with this route of administration, whereas bradycardia and atrioventricular block may be significant.

Amiodarone has many important drug interactions and all medications should be reviewed during drug initiation or dose adjustments. Amiodarone is a substrate for the liver cytochrome metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4 and its levels are increased by drugs that inhibit this enzyme, eg, the histamine $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ blocker cimetidine. Drugs that induce CYP3A4, eg, rifampin, decrease amiodarone concentration when coadministered. Amiodarone inhibits the other liver cytochrome metabolizing enzymes and may result in high levels of drugs that are substrates for these enzymes, eg, digoxin and warfarin.

\section*{Therapeutic Use}

Low doses ( $100-200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) of amiodarone are effective in maintaining normal sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation. The drug is effective in the prevention of recurrent ventricular tachycardia. Its use is not associated with an increase in mortality in patients with coronary artery disease or heart failure. In many centers, the implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has succeeded drug therapy as the primary treatment modality for ventricular tachycardia, but amiodarone may be used for ventricular tachycardia as adjuvant therapy to decrease the frequency of uncomfortable ICD discharges. The drug increases the pacing and defibrillation threshold and these devices require retesting after a maintenance dose has been achieved.

\section*{BRETYLI UM}

Bretylium was first introduced as an antihypertensive agent. It interferes with the neuronal release of catecholamines but also has direct antiarrhythmic properties.

\section*{Cardiac \& Extracardiac Effects}

Bretylium lengthens the ventricular (but not the atrial) action potential duration and effective refractory period. This effect is most pronounced in ischemic cells, which have shortened action potential durations. Thus, bretylium may reverse the shortening of action potential duration caused by ischemia.

Since bretylium causes an initial release of catecholamines, it has some positive inotropic actions when first administered. This action may also precipitate ventricular arrhythmias and must be watched for at the onset of therapy with the drug.

The drug's sympathoplegic actions may result in postural hypotension. This effect can be almost totally prevented by concomitant administration of a tricyclic antidepressant agent such as protriptyline. Nausea and vomiting may occur after the intravenous administration of a bolus of bretylium.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

Bretylium is available only for intravenous use in the USA. In adults, an intravenous bolus of bretylium tosylate, $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, is administered over a 10-minute period. This dosage may be repeated after 30 minutes. Maintenance therapy is achieved by a similar bolus every $4-6$ hours or by a constant infusion of $0.5-2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$.

\section*{Therapeutic Use}

Bretylium is rarely used and then only in an emergency setting, often during attempted resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation when lidocaine and cardioversion have failed. In most centers amiodarone is preferred for this indication.

\section*{SOTALOL}

Sotalol has both $B$-adrenergic receptor-blocking (class 2 ) and action potential prolonging (class 3 ) actions. The drug is formulated as a racemic mixture of $d$ - and $I$-sotalol. All the B-adrenergic blocking activity resides in the I-isomer; the d-and I-isomers share action potential prolonging actions. Beta-adrenergic blocking action is not cardioselective and is maximal at doses below those required for action potential prolongation.
<smiles>CCCCNc1ccc(C(O)CNC(C)C)cc1</smiles>

Sotalol

Sotalol is well absorbed orally with bioavailability of approximately 100\%. It is not metabolized in the liver and it is not bound to plasma proteins. Excretion is predominantly by the kidneys in the unchanged form with a half-life of approximately 12 hours. Because of its relatively simple pharmacokinetics, it exhibits few direct drug interactions. Its most significant cardiac adverse effect is an extension of its pharmacologic action: a dose-related incidence of torsade de pointes that approaches $6 \%$ at the highest recommended daily dose. Patients with overt heart failure may experience further depression of left ventricular function during treatment with sotalol.

Sotalol is approved for the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and the maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation. It is also approved for treatment of supraventricular and ventricular
arrhythmias in the pediatric age group. Sotalol decreases the threshold for cardiac defibrillation.

\section*{DOFETI LI DE}

Dofetilide has class 3 action potential prolonging action. This action is effected by a dose-dependent blockade of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Kr}}$. Dofetilide block of $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Kr}}$ increases in hypokalemia. Dofetilide produces no relevant blockade of the other potassium channels or the sodium channel. Because of the slow rate of recovery from blockade, the extent of blockade shows little dependence on stimulation frequency. However, dofetilide does show less action potential prolongation at rapid rates because of the increased importance of other potassium channels such as $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Ks}}$ at higher frequencies.

Dofetilide is 100\% bioavailable. Verapamil increases peak plasma dofetilide concentration by increasing intestinal blood flow. Eighty percent of an oral dose is eliminated by the kidneys unchanged; the remainder is eliminated in the urine as inactive metabolites. Inhibitors of the renal cation secretion mechanism, eg, cimetidine, prolong the half-life of dofetilide. Since the QT-prolonging effects and risks of ventricular proarrhythmia are directly related to plasma concentration, dofetilide dosage must be based on the estimated creatinine clearance. Treatment with dofetilide should be initiated in hospital after baseline measurement of the rate-corrected QT interval (QT ${ }_{\mathrm{C}}$ ) and serum electrolytes. A baseline QT ${ }_{\mathrm{C}}$ of $>450 \mathrm{~ms}$ ( 500 ms in the presence of an intraventricular conduction delay), bradycardia of < 50 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$, and hypokalemia are relative contraindications to its use.

Dofetilide is approved for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation. It is also effective in restoring normal sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation.

\section*{I BUTI LI DE}

Ibutilide slows cardiac repolarization by blockade of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current. Activation of slow inward sodium current has also been suggested as an additional mechanism of action. After intravenous administration, ibutilide is rapidly cleared from the plasma by hepatic metabolism. The metabolites are excreted by the kidney. The elimination half-life averages 6 hours.

Intravenous ibutilide is used for the acute conversion of atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm. The drug is more effective in atrial flutter than fibrillation, with a mean time to termination of 20 minutes. The most important adverse effect is excessive QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes. Patients require continuous ECG monitoring for 4 hours following ibutilide infusion or until $\mathrm{QT}_{\mathrm{C}}$ returns to baseline.

\section*{Calcium Channel- Blocking Drugs (Class 4)}

These drugs, of which verapamil is the prototype, were first introduced as antianginal agents and are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 12. Verapamil and diltiazem also have antiarrhythmic effects.

\section*{VERAPAMIL}

\section*{Cardiac Effects}

Verapamil blocks both activated and inactivated L-type calcium channels. Thus, its effect is more marked in tissues that fire frequently, those that are less completely polarized at rest, and those in which activation depends exclusively on the calcium current, such as the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. Atrioventricular nodal conduction time and effective refractory period are invariably prolonged by therapeutic concentrations. Verapamil usually slows the sinoatrial node by its direct action, but its hypotensive action may occasionally
result in a small reflex increase of sinoatrial nodal rate.
Verapamil can suppress both early and delayed afterdepolarizations and may antagonize slow responses arising in severely depolarized tissue.

\section*{Extracardiac Effects}

Verapamil causes peripheral vasodilation, which may be beneficial in hypertension and peripheral vasospastic disorders. Its effects upon smooth muscle produce a number of extracardiac effects (see Chapter 12).

\section*{Toxicity}

\section*{CARDIAC}

Verapamil's cardiotoxic effects are dose-related and usually avoidable. A common error has been to administer intravenous verapamil to a patient with ventricular tachycardia misdiagnosed as supraventricular tachycardia. In this setting, hypotension and ventricular fibrillation can occur. Verapamil's negative inotropic effects may limit its clinical usefulness in diseased hearts (see Chapter 12). Verapamil can induce atrioventricular block when used in large doses or in patients with atrioventricular nodal disease. This block can be treated with atropine and B-receptor stimulants. In patients with sinus node disease, verapamil can precipitate sinus arrest.

\section*{EXTRACARDIAC}

Adverse effects include constipation, lassitude, nervousness, and peripheral edema.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics \& Dosage}

The half-life of verapamil is approximately 7 hours. It is extensively metabolized by the liver; after oral administration, its bioavailability is only about $20 \%$. Therefore, verapamil must be administered with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction.

In adult patients without heart failure or sinoatrial or atrioventricular nodal disease, parenteral verapamil can be used to terminate supraventricular tachycardia, although adenosine is the agent of first choice. Verapamil dosage is an initial bolus of 5 mg administered over $2-5$ minutes, followed a few minutes later by a second 5 mg bolus if needed. Thereafter, doses of $5-10 \mathrm{mg}$ can be administered every $4-6$ hours, or a constant infusion of $0.4 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ may be used.

Effective oral dosages are higher than intravenous dosage because of first-pass metabolism and range from 120 to 640 mg daily, divided into three or four doses.

\section*{Therapeutic Use}

Supraventricular tachycardia is the major arrhythmia indication for verapamil. Adenosine or verapamil are preferred over older treatments (propranolol, digoxin, edrophonium, vasoconstrictor agents, and cardioversion) for termination. Verapamil can also reduce the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation and flutter. It only rarely converts atrial flutter and fibrillation to sinus rhythm. Verapamil is occasionally useful in ventricular arrhythmias. However, the use of intravenous verapamil in a patient with sustained ventricular tachycardia can cause hemodynamic collapse.

\section*{DILTI AZEM}

Diltiazem appears to be similar in efficacy to verapamil in the management of supraventricular arrhythmias, including rate control in atrial fibrillation. An intravenous form of diltiazem is available for the latter indication and causes hypotension or bradyarrhythmias relatively infrequently.

\section*{MI SCELLANEOUS ANTI ARRHYTHMI C AGENTS}

Certain agents used for the treatment of arrhythmias do not fit the conventional class 1-4 organization. These include digitalis (discussed in Chapter 13), adenosine, magnesium, and potassium.

\section*{ADENOSINE}

\section*{Mechanism \& Clinical Use}

Adenosine is a nucleoside that occurs naturally throughout the body. Its half-life in the blood is less than 10 seconds. Its mechanism of action involves activation of an inward rectifier $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current and inhibition of calcium current. The results of these actions are marked hyperpolarization and suppression of calcium-dependent action potentials. When given as a bolus dose, adenosine directly inhibits atrioventricular nodal conduction and increases the atrioventricular nodal refractory period but has lesser effects on the sinoatrial node. Adenosine is currently the drug of choice for prompt conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm because of its high efficacy ( $90-95 \%$ ) and very short duration of action. It is usually given in a bolus dose of 6 mg followed, if necessary, by a dose of 12 mg . An uncommon variant of ventricular tachycardia is adenosine sensitive. The drug is less effective in the presence of adenosine receptor blockers such as theophylline or caffeine, and its effects are potentiated by adenosine uptake inhibitors such as dipyridamole.

\section*{Toxicity}

Adenosine causes flushing in about $20 \%$ of patients and shortness of breath or chest burning (perhaps related to bronchospasm) in over $10 \%$. Induction of high-grade atrioventricular block may occur but is very shortlived. Atrial fibrillation may occur. Less common toxicities include headache, hypotension, nausea, and paresthesias.

\section*{MAGNESI UM}

Originally used for patients with digitalis-induced arrhythmias who were hypomagnesemic, magnesium infusion has been found to have antiarrhythmic effects in some patients with normal serum magnesium levels. The mechanisms of these effects are not known, but magnesium is recognized to influence $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase, sodium channels, certain potassium channels, and calcium channels. Magnesium therapy appears to be indicated in patients with digitalis-induced arrhythmias if hypomagnesemia is present; it is also indicated in some patients with torsade de pointes even if serum magnesium is normal. The usual dosage is 1 g (as sulfate) given intravenously over 20 minutes and repeated once if necessary. A full understanding of the action and indications of magnesium as an antiarrhythmic drug awaits further investigation.

\section*{POTASSI UM}

The significance of the potassium ion concentrations inside and outside the cardiac cell membrane has been discussed earlier in this chapter. The effects of increasing serum $K^{+}$can be summarized as (1) a resting potential depolarizing action and (2) a membrane potential stabilizing action, the latter caused by increased potassium permeability. Hypokalemia results in an increased risk of early and delayed afterdepolarizations, and ectopic pacemaker activity, especially in the presence of digitalis; hyperkalemia depresses ectopic pacemakers (severe hyperkalemia is required to suppress the sinoatrial node) and slows conduction. Because both insufficient and excess potassium are potentially arrhythmogenic, potassium therapy is directed toward normalizing potassium gradients and pools in the body.

\section*{PRINCI PLES I N THE CLI NI CAL USE OF ANTI ARRHYTHMI C AGENTS}

The margin between efficacy and toxicity is particularly narrow for antiarrhythmic drugs. Risks and benefits must be carefully considered (see Antiarrhythmic Drug-Use Principles Applied to Atrial Fibrillation).

\section*{Antiarrhythmic Drug-Use Principles Applied to Atrial Fibrillation}

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia observed clinically. Its prevalence increases from $\sim$ $0.5 \%$ in individuals younger than 65 years of age to $10 \%$ in individuals older than 80. Diagnosis is usually straightforward by means of an ECG. The ECG may also enable the identification of a prior myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy, and ventricular pre-excitation. Hyperthyroidism is an important treatable cause of atrial fibrillation, and a thyroid panel should be obtained at the time of diagnosis to exclude this possibility. With the clinical history and physical examination as a guide, the presence and extent of the underlying heart disease should be evaluated, preferably using noninvasive techniques such as echocardiography.

Treatment of atrial fibrillation is initiated to relieve patient symptoms and prevent the complications of thromboembolism and tachycardia-induced heart failure, the result of prolonged uncontrolled heart rates. The initial treatment objective is control of the ventricular response. This is usually achieved by use of a calcium channel blocking drug alone or in combination with a B-adrenergic blocker. Digoxin may be of value in the presence of heart failure. A second objective is a restoration and maintenance of normal sinus rhythm. Several studies show that rate control (maintenance of ventricular rate in the range of $60-80$ beats $/ \mathrm{min}$ ) has a better benefit-to-risk outcome than rhythm control (conversion to normal sinus rhythm) in the long-term health of patients with atrial fibrillation. If rhythm control is deemed desirable, sinus rhythm is usually restored by DC cardioversion in the USA; in some countries, a class 1 antiarrhythmic drug is used initially. For patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, normal sinus rhythm may be restored with a single large oral dose of propafenone or flecainide, provided that safety is initially documented in a monitored setting. Intravenous ibutilide can restore sinus rhythm promptly. For restoration of sinus rhythm in an emergency, eg, atrial fibrillation associated with hypotension or angina, DC cardioversion is the preferred modality. A class 1 or class 3 antiarrhythmic drug is used to maintain normal sinus rhythm.

\section*{Pretreatment Evaluation}

Several important determinations must be made prior to initiation of any antiarrhythmic therapy:
(1) Eliminate the cause if possible. Precipitating factors must be recognized and eliminated if possible. These include not only abnormalities of internal homeostasis, such as hypoxia or electrolyte abnormalities (especially hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), but also drug therapy and underlying disease states such as hyperthyroidism or underlying cardiac disease. It is important to separate this abnormal substrate from triggering factors, such as myocardial ischemia or acute cardiac dilation, which may be treatable and reversible.
(2) Make a firm diagnosis. A firm arrhythmia diagnosis should be established. For example, the misuse of verapamil in patients with ventricular tachycardia mistakenly diagnosed as supraventricular tachycardia can lead to catastrophic hypotension and cardiac arrest. As increasingly sophisticated methods to characterize
underlying arrhythmia mechanisms become available and are validated, it may be possible to direct certain drugs toward specific arrhythmia mechanisms.
(3) Determine the baseline condition. A reliable baseline should be established against which to judge the efficacy of any subsequent antiarrhythmic intervention. Several methods are now available for such baseline quantitation. These include prolonged ambulatory monitoring, electrophysiologic studies that reproduce a target arrhythmia, reproduction of a target arrhythmia by treadmill exercise, or the use of transtelephonic monitoring for recording of sporadic but symptomatic arrhythmias.
(4) Question the need for therapy. The mere identification of an abnormality of cardiac rhythm does not necessarily require that the arrhythmia be treated. An excellent justification for conservative treatment was provided by the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) referred to earlier.

\section*{Benefits \& Risks}

The benefits of antiarrhythmic therapy are actually relatively difficult to establish. Two types of benefits can be envisioned: reduction of arrhythmia-related symptoms, such as palpitations, syncope, or cardiac arrest; or reduction in long-term mortality in asymptomatic patients. Among drugs discussed here, only Bblockers have been definitely associated with reduction of mortality in relatively asymptomatic patients, and the mechanism underlying this effect is not established (see Chapter 10).

Antiarrhythmic therapy carries with it a number of risks. In some cases, the risk of an adverse reaction is clearly related to high dosages or plasma concentrations. Examples include lidocaine-induced tremor or quinidine-induced cinchonism. In other cases, adverse reactions are unrelated to high plasma concentrations (eg, procainamide-induced agranulocytosis). For many serious adverse reactions to antiarrhythmic drugs, the combination of drug therapy and the underlying heart disease appears important.

Several specific syndromes of arrhythmia provocation by antiarrhythmic drugs have also been identified, each with its underlying pathophysiologic mechanism and risk factors. Drugs such as quinidine, sotalol, ibutilide, and dofetilide, which act-at least in part-by slowing repolarization and prolonging cardiac action potentials, can result in marked QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Treatment of torsade de pointes requires recognition of the arrhythmia, withdrawal of any offending agent, correction of hypokalemia, and treatment with maneuvers to increase heart rate (pacing or isoproterenol); intravenous magnesium also appears effective, even in patients with normal magnesium levels.

Drugs that markedly slow conduction, such as flecainide, or high concentrations of quinidine, can result in an increased frequency of reentry arrhythmias, notably ventricular tachycardia in patients with prior myocardial infarction in whom a potential reentry circuit may be present. Treatment here consists of recognition, withdrawal of the offending agent, and intravenous sodium.

\section*{Conduct of Antiarrhythmic Therapy}

The urgency of the clinical situation determines the route and rate of drug initiation. When immediate drug action is required, the intravenous route is preferred. Therapeutic drug levels can be achieved by administration of multiple intravenous boluses. Drug therapy can be considered effective when the target arrhythmia is suppressed (according to the measure used to quantify at baseline) and toxicities are absent. Conversely, drug therapy should not be considered ineffective unless toxicities occur at a time when arrhythmias are not suppressed.

Monitoring plasma drug concentrations can be a useful adjunct to managing antiarrhythmic therapy. Plasma drug concentrations are also important in establishing compliance during long-term therapy as well as in detecting drug interactions that may result in very high concentrations at low drug dosages or very low concentrations at high dosages.

\section*{DI URETI C AGENTS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Abnormalities in fluid volume and electrolyte composition are common and important clinical disorders. Drugs that block specific transport functions of the renal tubules are valuable clinical tools in the treatment of these disorders. Although various agents that increase urine volume (diuretics) have been described since antiquity, it was not until 1957 that a practical and powerful diuretic agent (chlorothiazide) became available for widespread use.

Technically, a "diuretic" is an agent that increases urine volume, while a "natriuretic" causes an increase in renal sodium excretion. Because natriuretics almost always also increase water excretion, they are usually called diuretics.

The nephron is divided structurally and functionally into several segments (Figure 15-1, Table 15-1), which are discussed in the first part of this chapter. Many diuretics exert their effects on specific membrane transport proteins in renal tubular epithelial cells. Other diuretics exert osmotic effects that prevent water reabsorption (mannitol), inhibit enzymes (acetazolamide), or interfere with hormone receptors in renal epithelial cells (aldosterone receptor blockers). These effects are discussed in the second part of the chapter. The physiology of each segment is closely linked to the pharmacology of the drugs acting there.

\section*{RENAL TUBULE TRANSPORT MECHANISMS PROXI MAL TUBULE}

Sodium bicarbonate ( $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ ), sodium chloride ( NaCl ), glucose, amino acids, and other organic solutes are reabsorbed via specific transport systems in the early proximal tubule (proximal convoluted tubule, PCT). Potassium ions ( $\mathrm{K}^{+}$) are reabsorbed via the paracellular pathway. Water is reabsorbed passively, maintaining the osmolality of proximal tubular fluid at a nearly constant level. As tubule fluid is processed along the length of the proximal tubule, the luminal concentrations of these solutes decrease relative to the concentration of inulin, a marker that is filtered but neither secreted nor absorbed by renal tubules. Approximately $66 \%$ of total sodium ions ( $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, but $85 \%$ of the filtered $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ ), $65 \%$ of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, $60 \%$ of the water, and virtually all of the filtered glucose and amino acids are reabsorbed in the proximal tubule.

Of the various solutes reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, the most relevant to diuretic action are $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ and NaCl . Of the currently available diuretics, only one group (carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, which block $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ reabsorption) acts predominantly in the PCT. In view of the large quantity of NaCl absorbed in this segment, a drug that specifically blocked proximal tubular absorption of NaCl would be a particularly powerful diuretic. No such drug is currently available.

Sodium bicarbonate reabsorption by the PCT is initiated by the action of a $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$exchanger (NHE3) located in the luminal membrane of the proximal tubule epithelial cell (Figure 15-2). This transport system allows $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to enter the cell from the tubular lumen in exchange for a proton ( $\mathrm{H}^{+}$) from inside the cell. As in all portions of the nephron, $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase in the basolateral membrane pumps the reabsorbed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$into the interstitium so as to maintain a low intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration. The $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secreted into the lumen combines with bicarbonate ( $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$) to form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ (carbonic acid), which is rapidly dehydrated to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ by carbonic anhydrase. Carbon dioxide produced by dehydration of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ enters the proximal
tubule cell by simple diffusion where it is then rehydrated back to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, facilitated by intracellular carbonic anhydrase. After dissociation of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is available for transport by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$ exchanger, and the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$is transported out of the cell by a basolateral membrane transporter (Figure 15-2). Bicarbonate reabsorption by the proximal tubule is thus dependent on carbonic anhydrase. This enzyme can be inhibited by acetazolamide and related agents.
Figure 15-2.

Apical membrane $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$exchange (via NHE3) and bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule cell. $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase is present in the basolateral membrane to maintain intracellular sodium and potassium levels within the normal range. Because of rapid equilibration, concentrations of the solutes are approximately equal in the interstitial fluid and the blood. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is found in other locations in addition to the brush border of the luminal membrane.

In the late proximal tubule, as $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$and organic solutes have been largely removed from the tubular fluid, the residual luminal fluid contains predominantly NaCl . Under these conditions, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption continues, but the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secreted by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$exchanger can no longer bind to $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$. Free $\mathrm{H}^{+}$causes luminal pH to fall, activating a still poorly defined Cr /base exchanger (Figure 15-2). The net effect of parallel $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$exchange and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-} /$base exchange is NaCl reabsorption. As yet, there are no diuretic agents that are known to act on this conjoint process.

Because water is reabsorbed in direct proportion to salt reabsorption in the proximal tubule, luminal fluid osmolality remains nearly constant along its length and an impermeant solute like inulin rises in concentration as water is reabsorbed. If large amounts of an impermeant solute such as mannitol (an osmotic diuretic, see below) are present in the tubular fluid, water reabsorption causes the concentration of
the solute and osmolality of tubular fluid to rise, eventually preventing further water reabsorption.
Organic acid secretory systems are located in the middle third of the straight part of the proximal tubule ( $\mathrm{S}_{2}$ segment). These systems secrete a variety of organic acids (uric acid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAI Ds], diuretics, antibiotics, etc) into the luminal fluid from the blood. These systems thus help deliver diuretics to the luminal side of the tubule, where most of them act. Organic base secretory systems (creatinine, choline, etc) are also present, in the early ( $\mathrm{S}_{1}$ ) and middle ( $\mathrm{S}_{2}$ ) segments of the proximal tubule.

\section*{LOOP OF HENLE}

At the boundary between the inner and outer stripes of the outer medulla, the proximal tubule empties into the thin descending limb of Henle's loop. Water is extracted from the descending limb of this loop by osmotic forces found in the hypertonic medullary interstitium. As in the proximal tubule, impermeant luminal solutes such as mannitol oppose this water extraction. The thin ascending limb is relatively waterimpermeable.

The thick ascending limb (TAL) of the loop of Henle actively reabsorbs NaCl from the lumen (about $25 \%$ of the filtered sodium), but unlike the proximal tubule and the thin limb of Henle's loop, it is nearly impermeable to water. Salt reabsorption in the TAL therefore dilutes the tubular fluid, and it is called a "diluting segment." Medullary portions of the thick ascending limb contribute to medullary hypertonicity and thereby also play an important role in concentration of urine by the collecting duct.

The NaCl transport system in the luminal membrane of the TAL is a $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+} / 2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$cotransporter (called NKCC2 or NK2CL) (Figure 15-3). This transporter is selectively blocked by diuretic agents known as "loop" diuretics (see below). Although the $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+} / 2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$transporter is itself electrically neutral (two cations and two anions are cotransported), the action of the transporter contributes to excess $\mathrm{K}^{+}$accumulation within the cell. Back diffusion of this $\mathrm{K}^{+}$into the tubular lumen causes a lumen-positive electrical potential that provides the driving force for reabsorption of cations-including magnesium and calcium-via the paracellular pathway. Thus, inhibition of salt transport in the thick ascending limb by loop diuretics, which reduces the lumen-positive potential, causes an increase in urinary excretion of divalent cations in addition to NaCl .

Ion transport pathways across the luminal and basolateral membranes of the thick ascending limb cell. The lumen positive electrical potential created by $\mathrm{K}+$ back diffusion drives divalent (and monovalent) cation reabsorption via the paracellular pathway. NKCC2 is the primary transporter in the luminal membrane.

\section*{DISTAL CONVOLUTED TUBULE}

Only about $10 \%$ of the filtered NaCl is reabsorbed in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Like the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, this segment is relatively impermeable to water and NaCl reabsorption further dilutes the tubular fluid. The mechanism of NaCl transport in the DCT is an electrically neutral thiazide-sensitive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$cotransporter (NCC, Figure 15-4).
Figure 15-4.

Ion transport pathways across the luminal and basolateral membranes of the distal convoluted tubule cell. As in all tubular cells, $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase is present in the basolateral membrane. NCC is the primary sodium and chloride transporter in the luminal membrane. (R, parathyroid hormone [PTH] receptor.)

Because $\mathrm{K}^{+}$does not recycle across the apical membrane of the DCT as it does in the TAL, there is no lumen-positive potential in this segment, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ are not driven out of the tubular lumen by electrical forces. Instead, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is actively reabsorbed by the DCT epithelial cell via an apical $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel and basolateral $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ exchanger (Figure 15-4). This process is regulated by parathyroid hormone.

\section*{COLLECTING TUBULE}

The collecting tubule (CCT) is responsible for only $2-5 \%$ of NaCl reabsorption by the kidney. Despite this small contribution, the CCT plays an important role in renal physiology and in diuretic action. As the final site of NaCl reabsorption, the collecting tubule is responsible for tight regulation of body fluid volume and for determining the final $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration of the urine. Furthermore, the collecting tubule is a site at which mineralocorticoids exert a significant influence. Lastly, the collecting tubule is the most important site of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ secretion by the kidney and the site at which virtually all diuretic-induced changes in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$balance occur.

The mechanism of NaCl reabsorption in the CCT is distinct from the mechanisms found in other tubule segments. The principal cells are the major sites of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, and water transport (Figure 15-5), and the intercalated cells are the primary sites of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion. Unlike cells in other nephron segments, the principal cells do not contain cotransport systems for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and other ions in their apical membranes.

Principal cell membranes exhibit separate ion channels for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Since these channels exclude anions, transport of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$or $\mathrm{K}^{+}$leads to a net movement of charge across the membrane. Because $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ entry into the principal cell predominates over $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion, a $10-50 \mathrm{mV}$ lumen-negative electrical potential develops. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$that enters the principal cell from the tubular fluid is then transported back to the blood via the basolateral $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase (Figure 15-5). The 10-50 mV lumen-negative electrical potential drives the transport of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$back to the blood via the paracellular pathway and draws $\mathrm{K}^{+}$out of cells through the apical membrane $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel. Thus, there is an important relationship between $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$delivery to the CCT and the resulting secretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Diuretics that act upstream of the CCT will increase $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$delivery to this site and will enhance $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. If the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is delivered with an anion that cannot be reabsorbed as readily as $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ (eg, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$), the lumen-negative potential is increased, and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion will be enhanced. This mechanism, combined with enhanced aldosterone secretion due to volume depletion, is the basis for most diuretic-induced $\mathrm{K}^{+}$wasting.
Figure 15-5.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-0455.jpg?height=1058&width=1743&top_left_y=883&top_left_x=191)

Ion transport pathways across the luminal and basolateral membranes of collecting tubule and collecting duct cells. Inward diffusion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$via the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) leaves a lumen-negative potential, which drives reabsorption of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and efflux of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. (R, aldosterone receptor; ADH, antidiuretic hormone.)

Reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$via the epithelial Na channel (ENaC) and its coupled secretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is regulated by aldosterone. This steroid hormone, through its actions on gene transcription, increases the activity of both
apical membrane channels and the basolateral $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase. This leads to an increase in the transepithelial electrical potential and a dramatic increase in both $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion.

The collecting tubule is also the site at which the final urine concentration is determined. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also called arginine vasopressin, AVP) controls the permeability of this segment to water by regulating the insertion of preformed water channels (aquaporin-2, AQP2) into the apical membrane via a G protein-coupled cAMP-mediated process (Figure 15-6). In the absence of ADH, the collecting tubule (and duct) is impermeable to water and dilute urine is produced. ADH markedly increases water permeability and this leads to the formation of a more concentrated final urine. ADH also stimulates the insertion of urea transporter UT1 molecules into the apical membranes of medullary collecting tubule cells. Urea concentration in the medulla plays an important role maintaining the high osmolarity of the medulla and in the concentration of urine. ADH secretion is regulated by serum osmolality and by volume status.

Below, in the presence of ADH, aquaporins are inserted into the apical membrane, greatly increasing water permeability.

\section*{BASIC PHARMACOLOGY OF DI URETI C AGENTS CARBONIC ANHYDRASE INHIBITORS}

Carbonic anhydrase is present in many nephron sites, but the predominant location of this enzyme is the luminal membrane of the PCT (Figure 15-2), where it catalyzes the dehydration of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ as described above. By blocking carbonic anhydrase, inhibitors block $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ reabsorption and cause diuresis.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors were the forerunners of modern diuretics. They were discovered when it was found that bacteriostatic sulfonamides caused an alkaline diuresis and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. With the development of newer agents, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are now rarely used as diuretics, but they still have several specific applications that are discussed below. The prototypical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor is acetazolamide.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

The carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are well absorbed after oral administration. An increase in urine pH from the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$diuresis is apparent within 30 minutes, maximal at 2 hours, and persists for 12 hours after a single dose. Excretion of the drug is by secretion in the proximal tubule $\mathrm{S}_{2}$ segment. Therefore, dosing must be reduced in renal insufficiency.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase activity profoundly depresses $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ - reabsorption in the PCT. At its maximal safely administered dosage, $85 \%$ of the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ - reabsorptive capacity of the superficial PCT is inhibited. Some $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$can still be absorbed at other nephron sites by carbonic anhydrase-independent mechanisms, so the overall effect of maximal acetazolamide dosage is only about $45 \%$ inhibition of whole kidney $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$reabsorption. Nevertheless, carbonic anhydrase inhibition causes significant $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ - losses and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (Table 15-2). Because of reduced $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$in the glomerular filtrate and the fact that $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ - depletion leads to enhanced NaCl reabsorption by the remainder of the nephron, the diuretic efficacy of acetazolamide decreases significantly with use over several days.
Table 15-2. Changes in Urinary Electrolyte Patterns and Body pH in Response to Diuretic Drugs.

At present, the major clinical applications of acetazolamide involve carbonic anhydrase-dependent $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ and fluid transport at sites other than the kidney. The ciliary body of the eye secretes $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$from the blood into the aqueous humor. Likewise, formation of cerebrospinal fluid by the choroid plexus involves $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$secretion. Although these processes remove $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$from the blood (the direction opposite to that in the proximal tubule), they are similarly inhibited by carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

\section*{Clinical Indications \& Dosage}

\section*{GLAUCOMA}
(Table 15-3) The reduction of aqueous humor formation by carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decreases the intraocular pressure. This effect is valuable in the management of glaucoma, making it the most common indication for use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Topically active carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (dorzolamide, brinzolamide) are also available. These topical compounds reduce intraocular pressure, but
plasma levels are undetectable. Thus, diuretic and systemic metabolic effects are eliminated for the topical agents.

}

\section*{Drug \\ Usual Oral Dosage}

Acetazolamide
250 mg 1-4 times daily
Dichlorphenamide
50 mg 1-3 times daily
Methazolamide
$50-100 \mathrm{mg} 2-3$ times daily

\section*{URINARY ALKALI NIZATION}

Uric acid, cystine, and other weak acids are most easily reabsorbed from acidic urine. Therefore, renal excretion of cystine (in cystinuria) and other weak acids can be enhanced by increasing urinary pH with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. In the absence of continuous $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$administration, these effects of acetazolamide last only 2-3 days. Prolonged therapy requires $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$administration.

\section*{METABOLIC ALKALOSIS}

Metabolic alkalosis is generally treated by correction of abnormalities in total body $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, intravascular volume, or mineralocorticoid levels. However, when the alkalosis is due to excessive use of diuretics in patients with severe heart failure, replacement of intravascular volume may be contraindicated. In these cases, acetazolamide can be useful in correcting the alkalosis as well as producing a small additional diuresis for correction of volume overload. Acetazolamide can also be used to rapidly correct the metabolic alkalosis that may develop in the setting of respiratory acidosis.

\section*{ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS}

Weakness, dizziness, insomnia, headache, and nausea can occur in mountain travelers who rapidly ascend above 3000 m . The symptoms are usually mild and last for a few days. In more serious cases, rapidly progressing pulmonary or cerebral edema can be life-threatening. By decreasing cerebrospinal fluid formation and by decreasing the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid and brain, acetazolamide can increase ventilation and diminish symptoms of mountain sickness.

\section*{OTHER USES}

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have been used as adjuvants in the treatment of epilepsy, in some forms of hypokalemic periodic paralysis, and to increase urinary phosphate excretion during severe hyperphosphatemia.

\section*{Toxicity}

\section*{HYPERCHLOREMIC METABOLIC ACIDOSIS}

Acidosis predictably results from chronic reduction of body $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ - stores by carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
(Table 15-2) and limits the diuretic efficacy of these drugs to 2 or 3 days. Unlike the diuretic effect, acidosis persists as long as the drug is continued.

\section*{RENAL STONES}

Phosphaturia and hypercalciuria occur during the bicarbonaturic response to inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase. Renal excretion of solubilizing factors (eg, citrate) may also decline with chronic use. Calcium salts are relatively insoluble at alkaline pH , which means that the potential for renal stone formation from these salts is enhanced.

\section*{RENAL POTASSIUM WASTING}

Potassium wasting can occur because $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$presented to the collecting tubule is partially reabsorbed, increasing the lumen-negative electrical potential in that segment and enhancing $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. This effect can be counteracted by simultaneous administration of potassium chloride.

\section*{OTHER TOXI CITIES}

Drowsiness and paresthesias are common following large doses of acetazolamide. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may accumulate in patients with renal failure, leading to nervous system toxicity. Hypersensitivity reactions (fever, rashes, bone marrow suppression, and interstitial nephritis) may also occur.

\section*{Contraindications}

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor-induced alkalinization of the urine will decrease urinary excretion of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$and may contribute to the development of hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis.

\section*{LOOP DI URETI CS}

Loop diuretics selectively inhibit NaCl reabsorption in the TAL. Due to the large NaCl absorptive capacity of this segment and the fact that the diuretic action of these drugs is not limited by development of acidosis, as is the case with the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, loop diuretics are among the most efficacious diuretic agents available.

\section*{Chemistry}

The two prototypical drugs of this group are furosemide and ethacrynic acid. The structures of these diuretics are shown in Figure 15-7. In addition to furosemide, bumetanide and torsemide are sulfonamide loop diuretics.

Ethacrynic acid

Two loop diuretics. The shaded methylene group on ethacrynic acid is reactive and may combine with free sulfhydryl groups.

Ethacrynic acid—not a sulfonamide derivative—is a phenoxyacetic acid derivative containing an adjacent ketone and methylene group (Figure 15-7). The methylene group (shaded) forms an adduct with the free sulfhydryl group of cysteine. The cysteine adduct appears to be an active form of the drug.

Organic mercurial diuretics also inhibit salt transport in the TAL but are no longer used because of their toxicity.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

The loop diuretics are rapidly absorbed. They are eliminated by the kidney by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Absorption of oral torsemide is more rapid (1 hour) than that of furosemide (2-3 hours) and is nearly as complete as with intravenous administration. The duration of effect for furosemide is usually 2-3 hours and that of torsemide is 4-6 hours. Half-life depends on renal function. Since loop agents act on the luminal side of the tubule, their diuretic activity correlates with their secretion by the proximal tubule. Reduction in the secretion of loop diuretics may result from simultaneous administration of agents such as NSAIDs or probenecid, which compete for weak acid secretion in the proximal tubule. Metabolites of ethacrynic acid and furosemide have been identified, but it is not known if they have any diuretic activity. Torsemide has at least one active metabolite with a half-life considerably longer than that of the parent compound.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

These drugs inhibit NKCC2, the luminal $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+} / 2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$transporter in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. By inhibiting this transporter, the loop diuretics reduce the reabsorption of NaCl and also diminish the lumen-positive potential that comes from $\mathrm{K}^{+}$recycling (Figure 15-3). This positive potential normally drives divalent cation reabsorption in the loop (Figure 15-3), and by reducing this potential, loop diuretics cause an increase in $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ excretion. Prolonged use can cause significant hypomagnesemia in some
patients. Since vitamin D-induced intestinal absorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can be increased and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is actively reabsorbed in the DCT, loop diuretics do not generally cause hypocalcemia. However, in disorders that cause hypercalcemia, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ excretion can be usefully enhanced by treatment with loop diuretics combined with saline infusions.

Loop diuretics induce synthesis of renal prostaglandins, which participate in the renal actions of these diuretics. NSAIDs (eg, indomethacin) can interfere with the actions of the loop diuretics by reducing prostaglandin synthesis in the kidney. This interference is minimal in otherwise normal subjects but may be significant in patients with nephrotic syndrome or hepatic cirrhosis.

In addition to their diuretic activity, loop agents have direct effects on blood flow through several vascular beds. Furosemide increases renal blood flow. Both furosemide and ethacrynic acid have also been shown to reduce pulmonary congestion and left ventricular filling pressures in heart failure before a measurable increase in urinary output occurs, and in anephric patients.

\section*{Clinical Indications \& Dosage}
(Table 15-4) The most important indications for the use of the loop diuretics include acute pulmonary edema, other edematous conditions, and acute hypercalcemia. The use of loop diuretics in these conditions is discussed in Clinical Pharmacology. Other indications for loop diuretics include hyperkalemia, acute renal failure, and anion overdose.

$50-200 \mathrm{mg}$
Furosemide
$20-80 \mathrm{mg}$
Torsemide
$5-20 \mathrm{mg}$
${ }^{1}$ As single dose or in two divided doses.

\section*{HYPERKALEMIA}

In mild hyperkalemia-or after acute management of severe hyperkalemia by other measures-loop diuretics can significantly enhance urinary excretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. This response is enhanced by simultaneous NaCl and water administration.

\section*{ACUTE RENAL FAILURE}

Loop agents can increase the rate of urine flow and enhance $K^{+}$excretion in acute renal failure. However,
they do not shorten the duration of renal failure. If a large pigment load has precipitated acute renal failure (or threatens to), loop agents may help flush out intratubular casts and ameliorate intratubular obstruction. On the other hand, loop agents can theoretically worsen cast formation in myeloma and light chain nephropathy.

\section*{ANION OVERDOSE}

Loop diuretics are useful in treating toxic ingestions of bromide, fluoride, and iodide, which are reabsorbed in the thick ascending limb. Saline solution must be administered to replace urinary losses of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and to provide $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, so as to avoid extracellular fluid volume depletion.

\section*{Toxicity}

\section*{HYPOKALEMIC METABOLIC ALKALOSIS}

By inhibiting salt reabsorption in the TAL, loop diuretics increase delivery to the collecting duct. Increased delivery leads to increased secretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$by the duct, causing hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis (Table 15-2). This toxicity is a function of the magnitude of the diuresis and can be reversed by $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ replacement and correction of hypovolemia.

\section*{OTOTOXI CITY}

Loop diuretics occasionally cause dose-related hearing loss that is usually reversible. It is most common in patients who have diminished renal function or who are also receiving other ototoxic agents such as aminoglycoside antibiotics.

\section*{hyperuri CEMI A}

Loop diuretics can cause hyperuricemia and precipitate attacks of gout. This is caused by hypovolemiaassociated enhancement of uric acid reabsorption in the proximal tubule. It may be prevented by using lower doses to avoid development of hypovolemia.

\section*{hypomagnesemi A}

Magnesium depletion is a predictable consequence of the chronic use of loop agents and occurs most often in patients with dietary magnesium deficiency. It can be reversed by administration of oral magnesium preparations.

\section*{ALLERGIC \& OTHER REACTIONS}

Except for ethacrynic acid, the loop diuretics are sulfonamides. Therefore skin rash, eosinophilia and, less often, interstitial nephritis are occasional side effects of these drugs. This toxicity usually resolves rapidly after drug withdrawal. Allergic reactions are much less common with ethacrynic acid.

Because Henle's loop is normally responsible for so much salt and water reabsorption, loop diuretics can cause severe dehydration. Hyponatremia is less common than with the thiazides (see below), but patients who increase water intake in response to hypovolemia-induced thirst can become severely hyponatremic with loop agents. Loop agents are sometimes used for their calciuric effect, but hypercalcemia can occur in volume-depleted patients who have another-previously occult-cause for hypercalcemia, such as metastatic breast or squamous cell lung carcinoma.

\section*{Contraindications}

Furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide may exhibit allergic cross-reactivity in patients who are sensitive to other sulfonamides but this appears to be very rare. Overzealous use of any diuretic is dangerous in hepatic cirrhosis, borderline renal failure, or heart failure (see below).

\section*{THI AZI DES}

The thiazide diuretics emerged from efforts to synthesize more potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. It subsequently became clear that the thiazides inhibit NaCl transport predominantly in the DCT. However, some members of this group retain significant carbonic anhydrase inhibitory activity. The prototypical thiazide is hydrochlorothiazide.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Like carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and many loop diuretics, all of the thiazides have an unsubstituted sulfonamide group (Figure 15-8).

Hydrochlorothiazide and related agents.

All of the thiazides can be administered orally, but there are differences in their metabolism. Chlorothiazide, the parent of the group, is not very lipid-soluble and must be given in relatively large doses. It is the only
thiazide available for parenteral administration. Chlorthalidone is slowly absorbed and has a longer duration of action. Although indapamide is excreted primarily by the biliary system, enough of the active form is cleared by the kidney to exert its diuretic effect in the DCT.

All of the thiazides are secreted by the organic acid secretory system in the proximal tubule and compete with the secretion of uric acid by that system. As a result, thiazide use may blunt uric acid secretion and elevate serum uric acid level.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Thiazides inhibit NaCl reabsorption from the luminal side of epithelial cells in the DCT by blocking the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ $/ \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$transporter (NCC). In contrast to the situation in the TAL, where loop diuretics inhibit $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption, thiazides actually enhance $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption. This enhancement has been postulated to result from effects in both the proximal and distal convoluted tubules. In the proximal tubule, thiazideinduced volume depletion leads to enhanced $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and passive $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption. In the DCT, lowering of intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$by thiazide-induced blockade of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry enhances $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ exchange in the basolateral membrane (Figure 15-4), and increases overall reabsorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. While thiazides rarely cause hypercalcemia as the result of this enhanced reabsorption, they can unmask hypercalcemia due to other causes (eg, hyperparathyroidism, carcinoma, sarcoidosis). Thiazides are useful in the treatment of kidney stones caused by hypercalciuria.

The action of thiazides depends in part on renal prostaglandin production. As described above for the loop diuretics, the actions of thiazides can also be inhibited by NSAI Ds under certain conditions.

\section*{Clinical Indications \& Dosage}
(Table 15-5) The major indications for thiazide diuretics are (1) hypertension, (2) heart failure, (3) nephrolithiasis due to idiopathic hypercalciuria, and (4) nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Use of the thiazides in each of these conditions is described in Clinical Pharmacology.

\section*{Toxicity}

\section*{HYPOKALEMIC METABOLIC ALKALOSIS AND HYPERURICEMIA}

These toxicities are similar to those observed with loop diuretics (see above and Table 15-2).

\section*{IMPAIRED CARBOHYDRATE TOLERANCE}

Hyperglycemia may occur in patients who are overtly diabetic or who have even mildly abnormal glucose tolerance tests. The effect is due to both impaired pancreatic release of insulin and diminished tissue utilization of glucose. Hyperglycemia may be partially reversible with correction of hypokalemia.

\section*{HYPERLI PIDEMIA}

Thiazides cause a 5-15\% increase in total serum cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins (LDL). These levels may return toward baseline after prolonged use.

\section*{HYPONATREMIA}

Hyponatremia is an important adverse effect of thiazide diuretics. It is due to a combination of hypovolemia-induced elevation of ADH, reduction in the diluting capacity of the kidney, and increased thirst. It can be prevented by reducing the dose of the drug or limiting water intake.

\section*{ALLERGIC REACTIONS}

The thiazides are sulfonamides and share cross-reactivity with other members of this chemical group. Photosensitivity or generalized dermatitis occurs rarely. Serious allergic reactions are extremely rare but do include hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute necrotizing pancreatitis.

\section*{OTHER TOXI CITIES}

Weakness, fatigability, and paresthesias similar to those of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may occur. Impotence has been reported but is probably related to volume depletion.

\section*{Contraindications}

Excessive use of any diuretic is dangerous in hepatic cirrhosis, borderline renal failure, or heart failure (see below).

\section*{POTASSI UM-SPARI NG DI URETI CS}

These diuretics prevent $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion by antagonizing the effects of aldosterone at the late distal and cortical collecting tubules. Inhibition may occur by direct pharmacologic antagonism of mineralocorticoid receptors (spironolactone, eplerenone) or by inhibition of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$influx through ion channels in the luminal membrane (amiloride, triamterene).

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

The structures of spironolactone and amiloride are shown in Figure 15-9.

Potassium-sparing diuretics.

Spironolactone is a synthetic steroid that acts as a competitive antagonist to aldosterone. Onset and duration of its action are determined by the kinetics of the aldosterone response in the target tissue. Substantial inactivation of spironolactone occurs in the liver. Overall, spironolactone has a rather slow onset of action, requiring several days before full therapeutic effect is achieved. Eplerenone is a spironolactone analog with greater selectivity for the aldosterone receptor.

Amiloride and triamterene are direct inhibitors of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$influx in the CCT. Triamterene is metabolized in the liver, but renal excretion is a major route of elimination for the active form and the metabolites. Because triamterene is extensively metabolized, it has a shorter half-life and must be given more frequently than amiloride (which is not metabolized).

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Potassium-sparing diuretics reduce $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption in the collecting tubules and ducts. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption (and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion) at this site is regulated by aldosterone, as described above. Aldosterone antagonists interfere with this process. Similar effects are observed with respect to $\mathrm{H}^{+}$handling by the intercalated cells of the collecting tubule, in part explaining the metabolic acidosis seen with aldosterone antagonists (Table 15-2).

Spironolactone and eplerenone bind to aldosterone receptors and may also reduce the intracellular formation of active metabolites of aldosterone. Amiloride and triamterene do not block the aldosterone receptor but instead directly interfere with $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry through the epithelial sodium ion channels (ENaC) in the apical membrane of the collecting tubule. Since $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion is coupled with $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry in this segment, these agents are also effective potassium-sparing diuretics.

The actions of the aldosterone antagonists depend on renal prostaglandin production. As described above
for loop diuretics and thiazides, the actions of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-sparing diuretics can be inhibited by NSAIDs under certain conditions.

\section*{Clinical Indications \& Dosage}
(Table 15-6) Potassium-sparing diuretics are most useful in states of mineralocorticoid excess or hyperaldosteronism (also called aldosteronism), due either to primary hypersecretion (Conn's syndrome, ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone production) or to secondary hyperaldosteronism (evoked by heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, or other conditions associated with diminished effective intravascular volume). Use of diuretics such as thiazides or loop agents can cause or exacerbate volume contraction and may cause secondary hyperaldosteronism. In the setting of enhanced mineralocorticoid secretion and excessive delivery of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to distal nephron sites, renal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$wasting occurs. Potassium-sparing diuretics of either type may be used in this setting to blunt the $K^{+}$secretory response.

\section*{Toxicity}

\section*{HYPERKALEMIA}

Unlike other diuretics, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-sparing diuretics can cause mild, moderate, or even life-threatening hyperkalemia (Table 15-2). The risk of this complication is greatly increased by renal disease (in which maximal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion may be reduced) or by the use of other drugs that reduce renin (B blockers, NSAIDs) or angiotensin II activity (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor inhibitors). Since most other diuretic agents lead to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$losses, hyperkalemia is more common when $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-sparing diuretics are used as the sole diuretic agent, especially in patients with renal insufficiency. With fixed-dosage combinations of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-sparing and thiazide diuretics, the thiazide-induced hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis are ameliorated. However, owing to variations in the bioavailability of the components of fixeddosage forms, the thiazide-associated adverse effects often predominate. Therefore, it is generally preferable to adjust the doses of the two drugs separately.

\section*{HYPERCHLOREMIC METABOLIC ACIDOSIS}

By inhibiting $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion in parallel with $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion, the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-sparing diuretics can cause acidosis similar to that seen with type IV renal tubular acidosis.

\section*{GYNECOMASTIA}

Synthetic steroids may cause endocrine abnormalities by actions on other steroid receptors. Gynecomastia, impotence, and benign prostatic hyperplasia have all been reported with spironolactone. Such effects have not been reported with eplerenone.

\section*{ACUTE RENAL FAILURE}

The combination of triamterene with indomethacin has been reported to cause acute renal failure. This has not been reported with other $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-sparing diuretics.

\section*{KIDNEY STONES}

Triamterene is only slightly soluble and may precipitate in the urine, causing kidney stones.

\section*{Contraindications}

These agents can cause severe, even fatal hyperkalemia in susceptible patients. Oral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$administration should be discontinued if $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-sparing diuretics are administered. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency
are especially vulnerable and should rarely be treated with these diuretics. Concomitant use of other agents that blunt the renin-angiotensin system (B blockers or ACE inhibitors) increases the likelihood of hyperkalemia. Patients with liver disease may have impaired metabolism of triamterene and spironolactone, so dosing must be carefully adjusted. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole) can markedly increase blood levels of eplerenone.

\section*{AGENTS THAT ALTER WATER EXCRETI ON Osmotic Diuretics}

The proximal tubule and descending limb of Henle's loop are freely permeable to water (Table 15-1). Any osmotically active agent that is filtered by the glomerulus but not reabsorbed causes water to be retained in these segments and promotes a water diuresis. Such agents can be used to reduce intracranial pressure and to promote prompt removal of renal toxins. The prototypic osmotic diuretic is mannitol.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Osmotic diuretics are poorly absorbed, which means that they must be given parenterally. If administered orally, mannitol causes osmotic diarrhea. Mannitol is not metabolized and is excreted by glomerular filtration within 30-60 minutes, without any important tubular reabsorption or secretion.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Osmotic diuretics have their major effect in the proximal tubule and the descending limb of Henle's loop. Through osmotic effects, they also oppose the action of ADH in the collecting tubule. The presence of a nonreabsorbable solute such as mannitol prevents the normal absorption of water by interposing a countervailing osmotic force. As a result, urine volume increases. The increase in urine flow rate decreases the contact time between fluid and the tubular epithelium, thus reducing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$as well as water reabsorption. The resulting natriuresis is of lesser magnitude than the water diuresis, leading eventually to excessive water loss and hypernatremia.

\section*{Clinical Indications \& Dosage}

\section*{TO INCREASE URINE VOLUME}

Osmotic diuretics are used to increase water excretion in preference to sodium excretion. This effect can be useful when avid $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention limits the response to conventional agents. It can be used to maintain urine volume and to prevent anuria that might otherwise result from presentation of large pigment loads to the kidney (eg, from hemolysis or rhabdomyolysis). Some oliguric patients do not respond to osmotic diuretics. Therefore, a test dose of mannitol ( 12.5 g intravenously) should be given prior to starting a continuous infusion. Mannitol should not be continued unless there is an increase in urine flow rate to more than 50 $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{h}$ during the 3 hours following the test dose. Mannitol ( $12.5-25 \mathrm{~g}$ ) can be repeated every 1-2 hours to maintain urine flow rate greater than $100 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$. Prolonged use of mannitol is not advised.

\section*{REDUCTION OF INTRACRANIAL AND INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE}

Osmotic diuretics alter Starling forces so that water leaves cells and reduces intracellular volume. This effect is used to reduce intracranial pressure in neurologic conditions and to reduce intraocular pressure before ophthalmologic procedures. A dose of $1-2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ mannitol is administered intravenously. Intracranial pressure, which must be monitored, should fall in 60-90 minutes.

\section*{Toxicity}

\section*{EXTRACELLULAR VOLUME EXPANSION}

Mannitol is rapidly distributed in the extracellular compartment and extracts water from cells. Prior to the diuresis, this leads to expansion of the extracellular volume and hyponatremia. This effect can complicate heart failure and may produce florid pulmonary edema. Headache, nausea, and vomiting are commonly observed in patients treated with osmotic diuretics.

\section*{DEHYDRATION, HYPERKALEMIA, AND HYPERNATREMIA}

Excessive use of mannitol without adequate water replacement can ultimately lead to severe dehydration, free water losses, and hypernatremia. As water is extracted from cells, intracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$concentration rises, leading to cellular losses and hyperkalemia. These complications can be avoided by careful attention to serum ion composition and fluid balance.

\section*{Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) Agonists}

Vasopressin and desmopressin are used in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. They are discussed in Chapter 37. Their renal action appears to be mediated primarily via $V_{2}$ receptors although $V_{1 a}$ receptors may also be involved.

\section*{Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) Antagonists}

A variety of medical conditions, including congestive heart failure and syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH), cause water retention as the result of ADH excess. Dangerous hyponatremia can result. Several nonpeptide ADH receptor antagonists (vaptans) have been studied, with encouraging clinical results, but only conivaptan has been approved for use. Two nonselective agents, lithium and demeclocycline (a tetracycline antimicrobial drug), also have anti-ADH effects.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Conivaptan, lithium, and demeclocycline are orally active. Conivaptan and demeclocycline have half-lives of 5-10 hours. Lithium (discussed in detail in Chapter 29) is never used as an ADH antagonist.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

Antidiuretic hormone antagonists inhibit the effects of ADH in the collecting tubule. Conivaptan is a pharmacologic antagonist at $\mathrm{V}_{1 \mathrm{a}}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{2}$ receptors. Both lithium and demeclocycline appear to reduce the formation of cyclic adenosine monophospate (cAMP) in response to ADH and also to interfere with the actions of cAMP in the collecting tubule cells, but the mechanisms of these effects is not known.

\section*{Clinical Indications \& Dosage}

\section*{SYNDROME OF INAPPROPRIATE ADH SECRETION (SIADH)}

Antidiuretic hormone antagonists are used to manage SIADH when water restriction has failed to correct the abnormality. This generally occurs in the outpatient setting, where water restriction cannot be enforced, or in the hospital when large quantities of intravenous fluid are needed for other purposes. Lithium carbonate has been used to treat this syndrome, but the response is unpredictable. Demeclocycline, in dosages of 600-1200 mg/d, yields a more predictable result and is less toxic. Appropriate plasma levels ( 2 $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{mL}$ ) should be maintained by monitoring. Unlike demeclocycline, conivaptan is administered by IV injection, so it is not suitable for chronic use in outpatients.

\section*{OTHER CAUSES OF ELEVATED ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE (ADH)}

Antidiuretic hormone is also elevated in response to diminished effective circulating blood volume, as often occurs in congestive heart failure. When treatment by volume replacement is not desirable, hyponatremia
may result. As for SIADH, water restriction is the treatment of choice, but if it is not successful, demeclocycline or conivaptan may be used.

\section*{Toxicity}

\section*{NEPHROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS}

If serum $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is not monitored closely, ADH antagonists can cause severe hypernatremia and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. If lithium is being used for a psychiatric disorder, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be treated with a thiazide diuretic or amiloride (see below).

\section*{RENAL FAI LURE}

Both lithium and demeclocycline have been reported to cause acute renal failure. Long-term lithium therapy may also cause chronic interstitial nephritis.

\section*{OTHER}

Adverse effects associated with lithium therapy are discussed in Chapter 29. Demeclocycline should be avoided in patients with liver disease (see Chapter 44) and in children younger than 12 years.

\section*{Diuretic Combinations}

\section*{LOOP AGENTS \& THI AZI DES}

Some patients are refractory to the usual dose of loop diuretics or become refractory after an initial response. Since these agents have a short half-life ( $2-6 \mathrm{hrs}$ ), refractoriness may be due to an excessive interval between doses. Renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention may be greatly increased during the time period when the drug is no longer active. After the dosing interval for loop agents is minimized or the dose is maximized, the use of two drugs acting at different nephron sites may exhibit dramatic synergy. Loop agents and thiazides in combination will often produce diuresis when neither agent acting alone is even minimally effective. There are several reasons for this phenomenon. First, salt and water reabsorption in either the TAL or the DCT can increase when the other is blocked. Inhibition of both can therefore produce more than an additive diuretic response. Second, thiazide diuretics often produce a mild natriuresis in the proximal tubule that is usually masked by increased reabsorption in the TAL. The combination of loop diuretics and thiazides can therefore block $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption, to some extent, from all three segments.

Metolazone is the usual thiazide-like drug used in patients refractory to loop agents alone, but it is likely that other thiazides would be as effective as metolazone. Moreover, metolazone is available only in an oral preparation, while chlorothiazide can be given parenterally.

The combination of loop diuretics and thiazides can mobilize large amounts of fluid, even in patients who have not responded to single agents. Therefore, close hemodynamic monitoring is essential. Routine outpatient use is not recommended. Furthermore, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-wasting is extremely common and may require parenteral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$administration with careful monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status.

\section*{POTASSI UM-SPARI NG DIURETICS \& LOOP AGENTS OR THI AZI DES}

Hypokalemia eventually develops in many patients who are placed on loop diuretics or thiazides. This can usually be managed with dietary NaCl restriction or with dietary KCl supplements. When hypokalemia cannot be managed in this way, the addition of a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-sparing diuretic can significantly lower $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion. While this approach is generally safe, it should be avoided in patients with renal insufficiency and in those receiving angiotensin antagonists such as ACE inhibitors, in whom life-threatening hyperkalemia can
develop in response to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-sparing diuretics.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF DI URETI C AGENTS}

A summary of the effects of diuretics on urinary electrolyte excretion is shown in Table 15-2.

\section*{Edematous States}

A common reason for diuretic use is for reduction of peripheral or pulmonary edema that has accumulated as a result of cardiac, renal, or vascular diseases that reduce blood delivery to the kidney. This reduction is sensed as insufficient "effective" arterial blood volume and leads to salt and water retention and edema formation. Judicious use of diuretics can mobilize this interstitial edema without significant reductions in plasma volume. However, excessive diuretic therapy may lead to further compromise of the effective arterial blood volume with reduction in perfusion of vital organs. Therefore, the use of diuretics to mobilize edema requires careful monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status and an understanding of the pathophysiology of the underlying illness.

\section*{HEART FAI LURE}

When cardiac output is reduced by heart failure, the resultant changes in blood pressure and blood flow to the kidney are sensed as hypovolemia and lead to renal retention of salt and water. This physiologic response initially increases intravascular volume and venous return to the heart and may partially restore the cardiac output toward normal (see Chapter 13).

If the underlying disease causes cardiac output to deteriorate despite expansion of plasma volume, the kidney continues to retain salt and water, which then leaks from the vasculature and becomes interstitial or pulmonary edema. At this point, diuretic use becomes necessary to reduce the accumulation of edema, particularly in the lungs. Reduction of pulmonary vascular congestion with diuretics may actually improve oxygenation and thereby improve myocardial function. Reduction of preload can reduce the size of the heart, allowing it to work at a more efficient fiber length. Edema associated with heart failure is generally managed with loop diuretics. In some instances, salt and water retention may become so severe that a combination of thiazides and loop diuretics is necessary.

In treating the heart failure patient with diuretics, it must always be remembered that cardiac output in these patients is being maintained in part by high filling pressures and that excessive use of diuretics may diminish venous return and further impair cardiac output. This is especially critical in right ventricular heart failure. Systemic, rather than pulmonary vascular, congestion is the hallmark of this disorder. Diureticinduced volume contraction will predictably reduce venous return and can severely compromise cardiac output if left ventricular filling pressure is reduced below 15 mm Hg (see Chapter 13).

Diuretic-induced metabolic alkalosis is another adverse effect that may further compromise cardiac function. While this complication can be treated with replacement of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and restoration of intravascular volume with saline, severe heart failure may preclude the use of saline even in patients who have received excessive diuretic therapy. In these cases, adjunctive use of acetazolamide will help correct the alkalosis.

Another serious toxicity of diuretic use, particularly in the cardiac patient, is hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can exacerbate underlying cardiac arrhythmias and contribute to digitalis toxicity. This can usually be avoided by having the patient reduce $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$intake, thus decreasing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$delivery to the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-secreting collecting tubule. Patients who are noncompliant with a low $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$diet must take oral KCl supplements or a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-sparing
diuretic.

\section*{KI DNEY DI SEASE}

A variety of renal diseases interfere with the kidney's critical role in volume homeostasis. Although some renal disorders cause salt wasting, most kidney diseases cause retention of salt and water. When loss of renal function is severe, diuretic agents are of little benefit, because there is insufficient glomerular filtration to sustain a natriuretic response. However, a large number of patients with milder degrees of renal insufficiency can be treated with diuretics when they retain sodium.

Many glomerular diseases, such as those associated with diabetes mellitus or systemic lupus erythematosus, exhibit renal retention of salt and water. The cause of this sodium retention is not precisely known, but it probably involves disordered regulation of the renal microcirculation and tubular function through release of vasoconstrictors, prostaglandins, cytokines, and other mediators. When edema or hypertension develops in these patients, diuretic therapy can be very effective. If heart failure is also present, see the warnings mentioned above.

Certain forms of renal disease, particularly diabetic nephropathy, are frequently associated with development of hyperkalemia at a relatively early stage of renal failure. In these cases, a thiazide or loop diuretic will enhance $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion by increasing delivery of salt to the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-secreting collecting tubule.

Patients with renal diseases leading to the nephrotic syndrome often present complex problems in volume management. These patients may exhibit fluid retention in the form of ascites or edema but have reduced plasma volume due to reduced plasma oncotic pressures. This is very often the case in patients with "minimal change" nephropathy. In these patients, diuretic use may cause further reductions in plasma volume that can impair glomerular filtration rate and may lead to orthostatic hypotension. Most other causes of nephrotic syndrome are associated with primary retention of salt and water by the kidney, leading to expanded plasma volume and hypertension despite the low plasma oncotic pressure. In these cases, diuretic therapy may be beneficial in controlling the volume-dependent component of hypertension.

In choosing a diuretic for the patient with kidney disease, there are a number of important limitations. Acetazolamide must usually be avoided because it can exacerbate acidosis. Potassium-sparing diuretics may cause hyperkalemia. Thiazide diuretics are generally ineffective when glomerular filtration rate falls below $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. Thus, loop diuretics are often the best choice in treating edema associated with kidney failure. Lastly, although excessive use of diuretics can impair renal function in all patients, the consequences are more serious in those with underlying renal disease.

\section*{HEPATIC CI RRHOSIS}

Liver disease is often associated with edema and ascites in conjunction with elevated portal hydrostatic pressures and reduced plasma oncotic pressures. Mechanisms for retention of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$by the kidney in this setting include diminished renal perfusion (from systemic vascular alterations), diminished plasma volume (due to ascites formation), and diminished oncotic pressure (hypoalbuminemia). In addition, there may be primary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention due to elevated plasma aldosterone levels.

When ascites and edema become severe, diuretic therapy can be very useful. However, cirrhotic patients are often resistant to loop diuretics because of decreased secretion of the drug into the tubular fluid and because of high aldosterone levels. In contrast, cirrhotic edema is unusually responsive to spironolactone and eplerenone. The combination of loop diuretics and an aldosterone receptor antagonist may be useful in
some patients.
It is important to note that, even more than in heart failure, overly aggressive use of diuretics in this setting can be disastrous. Vigorous diuretic therapy can cause marked depletion of intravascular volume, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Hepatorenal syndrome and hepatic encephalopathy are the unfortunate consequences of excessive diuretic use in the cirrhotic patient.

\section*{I DI OPATHI C EDEMA}

Despite intensive study, the pathophysiology of this disorder (fluctuating salt retention and edema) still remains obscure. Some studies, but not all, suggest that intermittent diuretic use may actually contribute to the syndrome. Idiopathic edema should probably be managed with moderate salt restriction alone if possible.

\section*{Nonedematous States}

\section*{HYPERTENSION}

The diuretic and mild vasodilator actions of the thiazides are useful in treating virtually all patients with essential hypertension, and may be sufficient in many. Loop diuretics are usually reserved for patients with renal insufficiency or heart failure. Moderate restriction of dietary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$intake ( $60-100 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{d}$ ) has been shown to potentiate the effects of diuretics in essential hypertension and to lessen renal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$wasting.

A recent very large study (over 30,000 participants) has shown that inexpensive diuretics like thiazides result in similar or superior outcomes to those found with ACE inhibitor or calcium channel blocker therapy. This important result reinforces the importance of thiazide therapy in hypertension.

Although diuretics are often successful as monotherapy, they also play an important role in patients who require multiple drugs to control blood pressure. Diuretics enhance the efficacy of many agents, particularly the ACE inhibitors. Patients being treated with powerful vasodilators such as hydralazine or minoxidil usually require simultaneous diuretics because the vasodilators cause significant salt and water retention.

\section*{NEPHROLITHIASIS}

Approximately two thirds of kidney stones contain $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ phosphate or $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ oxalate. Many patients with such stones exhibit a defect in proximal tubular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption that causes hypercalciuria. This can be treated with thiazide diuretics, which enhance $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule and thus reduce the urinary $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration. Salt intake must be reduced in this setting, as excess dietary NaCl will overwhelm the hypocalciuric effect of thiazides. Calcium stones may also be caused by increased intestinal absorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, or they may be idiopathic. In these situations, thiazides are also effective, but should be used as adjunctive therapy with decreased $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ intake and other measures.

\section*{HYPERCALCEMI A}

Hypercalcemia can be a medical emergency. Because loop diuretics reduce $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption significantly, they can be quite effective in promoting $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ diuresis. However, loop diuretics alone can cause marked volume contraction. If this occurs, loop diuretics are ineffective (and potentially counterproductive) because $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption in the proximal tubule would be enhanced. Thus, saline must be administered simultaneously with loop diuretics if an effective $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ diuresis is to be maintained. The usual approach is to infuse normal saline and furosemide ( $80-120 \mathrm{mg}$ ) intravenously. Once the diuresis begins, the rate of saline infusion can be matched with the urine flow rate to avoid volume depletion. Potassium chloride may
be added to the saline infusion as needed.

\section*{DIABETES INSI PIDUS}

Diabetes insipidus is due either to deficient production of ADH (neurogenic or central diabetes insipidus) or inadequate responsiveness to ADH (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). Administration of supplementary ADH or one of its analogs is only effective in central diabetes insipidus. Thiazide diuretics can reduce polyuria and polydipsia in both types of diabetes insipidus. This seemingly paradoxic beneficial effect is mediated through plasma volume reduction, with an associated fall in glomerular filtration rate, enhanced proximal reabsorption of NaCl and water, and decreased delivery of fluid to the downstream diluting segments. Thus, the maximum volume of dilute urine that can be produced is lowered and thiazides can significantly reduce urine flow in the polyuric patient. Dietary sodium restriction can potentiate the beneficial effects of thiazides on urine volume in this setting. Lithium ( $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$), used in the treatment of manic-depressive disorder, is a common cause of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and thiazide diuretics have been found to be helpful in treating it. Serum $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$levels must be carefully monitored in these patients, because diuretics may reduce renal clearance of $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$and raise plasma $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$levels into the toxic range (see Chapter 29). Lithium-induced polyuria can also be partially reversed by amiloride, which blocks $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$entry into collecting duct cells, much as it blocks $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry.

\section*{HI STAMI NE, SEROTONI N, \& THE ERGOT ALKALOI DS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Histamine and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) are biologically active amines that function as neurotransmitters and are found in non-neural tissues, have complex physiologic and pathologic effects through multiple receptor subtypes, and are often released locally. Together with endogenous peptides (see Chapter 17), prostaglandins and leukotrienes (see Chapter 18), and cytokines (see Chapter 56), they are sometimes called autacoids (Greek, "self-remedy") or local hormones in recognition of these properties.

Because of their broad and largely undesirable effects, neither histamine nor serotonin has any clinical application in the treatment of disease. However, compounds that selectively activate certain receptor subtypes or selectively antagonize the actions of these amines are of considerable clinical usefulness. This chapter therefore emphasizes the basic pharmacology of the agonist amines and the clinical pharmacology of the more selective agonist and antagonist drugs. The ergot alkaloids, compounds with partial agonist activity at serotonin and several other receptors, are discussed at the end of the chapter.

\section*{HI STAMI NE}

Histamine was synthesized in 1907 and later isolated from mammalian tissues. Early hypotheses concerning the possible physiologic roles of tissue histamine were based on similarities between the effects of intravenously administered histamine and the symptoms of anaphylactic shock and tissue injury. Marked species variation is observed, but in humans histamine is an important mediator of immediate allergic and inflammatory reactions, although it plays only a modest role in anaphylaxis. Histamine plays an important role in gastric acid secretion (see Chapter 63) and functions as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator (see Chapters 6, 21). Newer evidence indicates that histamine also plays a role in chemotaxis of white blood cells.

\section*{BASIC PHARMACOLOGY OF HISTAMI NE}

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Histamine occurs in plants as well as in animal tissues and is a component of some venoms and stinging secretions.

Histamine is formed by decarboxylation of the amino acid I -histidine, a reaction catalyzed in mammalian tissues by the enzyme histidine decarboxylase. Once formed, histamine is either stored or rapidly inactivated. Very little histamine is excreted unchanged. The major metabolic pathways involve conversion to Nmethylhistamine, methylimidazoleacetic acid, and imidazoleacetic acid (IAA). Certain neoplasms (systemic mastocytosis, urticaria pigmentosa, gastric carcinoid, and occasionally myelogenous leukemia) are associated with increased numbers of mast cells or basophils and with increased excretion of histamine and its metabolites.
<smiles>NCCc1c[nH]cn1</smiles>

\section*{Histamine}

Most tissue histamine is sequestered and bound in granules (vesicles) in mast cells or basophils; the histamine
content of many tissues is directly related to their mast cell content. The bound form of histamine is biologically inactive, but many stimuli, as noted below, can trigger the release of mast cell histamine, allowing the free amine to exert its actions on surrounding tissues. Mast cells are especially rich at sites of potential tissue injury—nose, mouth, and feet; internal body surfaces; and blood vessels, particularly at pressure points and bifurcations.

Non-mast cell histamine is found in several tissues, including the brain, where it functions as a neurotransmitter. Endogenous neurotransmitter histamine may play a role in many brain functions such as neuroendocrine control, cardiovascular regulation, thermal and body weight regulation, and arousal (see Chapter 21).

A second important nonneuronal site of histamine storage and release is the enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells of the fundus of the stomach. ECL cells release histamine, one of the primary gastric acid secretagogues, to activate the acid-producing parietal cells of the mucosa (see Chapter 63).

\section*{Storage \& Release of Histamine}

The stores of histamine in mast cells can be released through several mechanisms.

\section*{IMMUNOLOGIC RELEASE}

Immunologic processes account for the most important pathophysiologic mechanism of mast cell and basophil histamine release. These cells, if sensitized by IgE antibodies attached to their surface membranes, degranulate "explosively" when exposed to the appropriate antigen (see Figure 56-5, effector phase). This type of release also requires energy and calcium. Degranulation leads to the simultaneous release of histamine, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and other mediators that are stored together in the granules. Histamine released by this mechanism is a mediator in immediate (type I) allergic reactions. Substances released during IgG- or IgM-mediated immune reactions that activate the complement cascade also release histamine from mast cells and basophils.

By a negative feedback control mechanism mediated by $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptors, histamine appears to modulate its own release and that of other mediators from sensitized mast cells in some tissues. In humans, mast cells in skin and basophils show this negative feedback mechanism; lung mast cells do not. Thus, histamine may act to limit the intensity of the allergic reaction in the skin and blood.

Endogenous histamine has a modulating role in a variety of inflammatory and immune responses. Upon injury to a tissue, released histamine causes local vasodilation and leakage of plasma containing mediators of acute inflammation (complement, C-reactive protein), and antibodies. Histamine has an active chemotactic attraction for inflammatory cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes). Histamine inhibits the release of lysosome contents and several T- and B-lymphocyte functions. Most of these actions are mediated by $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{H}_{4}$ receptors. Release of peptides from nerves in response to inflammation is also probably modulated by histamine, in this case acting through presynaptic $\mathrm{H}_{3}$ receptors.

\section*{CHEMICAL AND MECHANICAL RELEASE}

Certain amines, including drugs such as morphine and tubocurarine, can displace histamine from the heparinprotein complex within cells. This type of release does not require energy and is not associated with mast cell injury or degranulation. Loss of granules from the mast cell also releases histamine, since sodium ions in the extracellular fluid rapidly displace the amine from the complex. Chemical and mechanical mast cell injury causes degranulation and histamine release. Compound 48/ 80, an experimental drug, selectively releases
histamine from tissue mast cells by an exocytotic degranulation process requiring energy and calcium.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

\section*{MECHANI SM OF ACTION}

Histamine exerts its biologic actions by combining with specific cellular receptors located on the surface membrane. The four different histamine receptors thus far characterized are designated $\mathrm{H}_{1}-\mathrm{H}_{4}$ and are described in Table 16-1. Unlike the other amine transmitter receptors discussed previously, no subfamilies have been found within these major types, although different splice variants of several receptor types have been found.

All four receptor types have been cloned and belong to the large superfamily of receptors having seven membrane-spanning regions and coupled with G proteins (GPCR). The structures of the $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptors differ significantly and appear to be more closely related to muscarinic and $5-\mathrm{HT}_{1}$ receptors, respectively, than to each other. The $\mathrm{H}_{4}$ receptor has about $40 \%$ homology with the $\mathrm{H}_{3}$ receptor but does not seem to be closely related to any other histamine receptor. All four histamine receptors have been shown to have constitutive activity in some systems; thus, some "antihistamines" previously considered to be traditional pharmacologic antagonists must now be considered to be possible inverse agonists (Chapter 2). Indeed, many first- and second-generation $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ blockers (see below) are probably inverse agonists. Furthermore, a single molecule may be an agonist at one histamine receptor and an antagonist at another. For example, clobenprobit, an agonist at $\mathrm{H}_{4}$ receptors, is an antagonist or inverse agonist at $\mathrm{H}_{3}$ receptors (Table 16-1).

In the brain, $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptors are located on postsynaptic membranes, whereas $\mathrm{H}_{3}$ receptors are predominantly presynaptic. Activation of $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ receptors, which are present in endothelium, smooth muscle cells, and nerve endings, usually elicits an increase in phosphoinositol hydrolysis and an increase in intracellular calcium. Activation of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptors, present in gastric mucosa, cardiac muscle cells, and some immune cells, increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) via $G_{s}$. Like the $B_{2}$ adrenoceptor, under certain circumstances the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor may couple to $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{q}}$, activating the I $\mathrm{P}_{3}$-DAG (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphatediacylglycerol) cascade. Activation of $\mathrm{H}_{3}$ receptors decreases transmitter release from histaminergic and other neurons, probably mediated by a decrease in calcium influx through N -type calcium channels in nerve endings. $\mathrm{H}_{4}$ receptors are mainly found on leukocytes in the bone marrow and circulating blood. $\mathrm{H}_{4}$ receptors appear to have very important chemotactic effects on eosinophils and mast cells. In this role, they may play an important part in inflammation and allergy. They may also modulate production of these cell types and they may mediate, in part, the previously recognized effects of histamine on cytokine production.

\section*{TISSUE AND ORGAN SYSTEM EFFECTS OF HISTAMI NE}

Histamine exerts powerful effects on smooth and cardiac muscle, on certain endothelial and nerve cells, and on the secretory cells of the stomach. However, sensitivity to histamine varies greatly among species. Guinea pigs are exquisitely sensitive, humans, dogs, and cats somewhat less so, and mice and rats very much less so.

\section*{Nervous System}

Histamine is a powerful stimulant of sensory nerve endings, especially those mediating pain and itching. This $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-mediated effect is an important component of the urticarial response and reactions to insect and nettle stings. Some evidence suggests that local high concentrations can also depolarize efferent (axonal) nerve endings (see The "Triple Response," below). In the mouse, and probably in humans, respiratory neurons signaling inspiration and expiration are modulated by $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ receptors. Presynaptic $\mathrm{H}_{3}$ receptors play important
roles in modulating transmitter release in the nervous system. $\mathrm{H}_{3}$ agonists reduce the release of acetylcholine, amine, and peptide transmitters in various areas of the brain and in peripheral nerves.

\section*{Cardiovascular System}

In humans, injection or infusion of histamine causes a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and an increase in heart rate. The blood pressure changes are caused by the direct vasodilator action of histamine on arterioles and precapillary sphincters; the increase in heart rate involves both stimulatory actions of histamine on the heart and a reflex tachycardia. Flushing, a sense of warmth, and headache may also occur during histamine administration, consistent with the vasodilation. Vasodilation elicited by small doses of histamine is caused by $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-receptor activation and is mediated primarily by release of nitric oxide from the endothelium (see Chapter 19). The decrease in blood pressure is usually accompanied by a reflex tachycardia. Higher doses of histamine activate the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-mediated cAMP process of vasodilation and direct cardiac stimulation. In humans, the cardiovascular effects of small doses of histamine can usually be antagonized by $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-receptor antagonists alone.

Histamine-induced edema results from the action of the amine on $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ receptors in the vessels of the microcirculation, especially the postcapillary vessels. The effect is associated with the separation of the endothelial cells, which permits the transudation of fluid and molecules as large as small proteins into the perivascular tissue. This effect is responsible for the urticaria (hives) that signals the release of histamine in the skin. Studies of endothelial cells suggest that actin and myosin within these cells contract, resulting in separation of the endothelial cells and increased permeability.

Direct cardiac effects of histamine include both increased contractility and increased pacemaker rate. These effects are mediated chiefly by $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptors. In human atrial muscle, histamine can also decrease contractility; this effect is mediated by $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ receptors. The physiologic significance of these cardiac actions is not clear. Some of the cardiovascular signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis are due to released histamine, though several other mediators are involved and appear to be more important than histamine in humans.

\section*{Bronchiolar Smooth Muscle}

In both humans and guinea pigs, histamine causes bronchoconstriction mediated by $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ receptors. In the guinea pig, this effect is the cause of death from histamine toxicity, but in humans with normal airways, bronchoconstriction following small doses of histamine is not marked. However, patients with asthma are very sensitive to histamine. The bronchoconstriction induced in these patients probably represents a hyperactive neural response, since such patients also respond excessively to many other stimuli, and the response to histamine can be blocked by autonomic blocking drugs such as ganglionic blocking agents as well as by $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ receptor antagonists (see Chapter 20). Although methacholine provocation is more commonly used, tests using increasing doses of inhaled histamine have been used in the diagnosis of bronchial hyperreactivity in patients with suspected asthma or cystic fibrosis. Such individuals may be 100- to 1000-fold more sensitive to histamine (and methacholine) than are normal subjects. Curiously, a few species (eg, rabbit) respond to histamine with bronchodilation, reflecting the dominance of the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor in their airways.

\section*{Gastrointestinal Tract Smooth Muscle}

Histamine causes contraction of intestinal smooth muscle, and histamine-induced contraction of guinea pig ileum is a standard bioassay for this amine. The human gut is not as sensitive as that of the guinea pig, but large doses of histamine may cause diarrhea, partly as a result of this effect. This action of histamine is mediated by $H_{1}$ receptors.

\section*{Other Smooth Muscle Organs}

In humans, histamine generally has insignificant effects on the smooth muscle of the eye and genitourinary tract. However, pregnant women suffering anaphylactic reactions may abort as a result of histamine-induced contractions, and in some species the sensitivity of the uterus is sufficient to form the basis for a bioassay.

\section*{Secretory Tissue}

Histamine has long been recognized as a powerful stimulant of gastric acid secretion and, to a lesser extent, of gastric pepsin and intrinsic factor production. The effect is caused by activation of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptors on gastric parietal cells and is associated with increased adenylyl cyclase activity, cAMP concentration, and intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration. Other stimulants of gastric acid secretion such as acetylcholine and gastrin do not increase cAMP even though their maximal effects on acid output can be reduced-but not abolished-by $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-receptor antagonists. These actions are discussed in detail in Chapter 63. Histamine also stimulates secretion in the small and large intestine. In contrast, $\mathrm{H}_{3}$-selective histamine agonists inhibit acid secretion stimulated by food or pentagastrin in several species.

Histamine has much smaller effects on the activity of other glandular tissue at ordinary concentrations. Very high concentrations can cause adrenal medullary discharge.

\section*{Metabolic Effects}

Recent studies of $\mathrm{H}_{3}$-receptor knockout mice demonstrate that absence of this receptor results in animals with increased food intake, decreased energy expenditure, and obesity. They also show insulin resistance and increased blood levels of leptin and insulin. It is not yet known whether the $\mathrm{H}_{3}$ receptor has a similar role in humans.

\section*{The "Triple Response"}

Intradermal injection of histamine causes a characteristic red spot, edema, and flare response that was first described over 60 years ago. The effect involves three separate cell types: smooth muscle in the microcirculation, capillary or venular endothelium, and sensory nerve endings. At the site of injection, a reddening appears owing to dilation of small vessels, followed soon by an edematous wheal at the injection site and a red irregular flare surrounding the wheal. The flare is said to be caused by an axon reflex. A sensation of itching may accompany these effects.

Similar local effects may be produced by injecting histamine liberators (compound $48 / 80$, morphine, etc) intradermally or by applying the appropriate antigens to the skin of a sensitized person. Although most of these local effects can be blocked by prior administration of an $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-receptor-blocking agent, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{3}$ receptors may also be involved.

\section*{Other Effects Possibly Mediated by Histamine Receptors}

In addition to the local stimulation of peripheral pain nerve endings via $\mathrm{H}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ receptors, histamine may play a role in nociception in the central nervous system. Burimamide, an early candidate for $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ blocking action, and newer analogs with no effect on $\mathrm{H}_{1}, \mathrm{H}_{2}$, or $\mathrm{H}_{3}$ receptors, have been shown to have significant analgesic action in rodents when administered into the central nervous system. The analgesia is said to be comparable to that produced by opioids, but tolerance, respiratory depression, and constipation have not been reported. Although the mechanism of this action is not known, these compounds may represent an important new class of analgesics.

\section*{Other Histamine Agonists}

Small substitutions on the imidazole ring of histamine significantly modify the selectivity of the compounds for
the histamine receptor subtypes. Some of these are listed in Table 16-1.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF HI STAMI NE}

\section*{Clinical Uses}

In pulmonary function laboratories, histamine aerosol has been used as a provocative test of bronchial hyperreactivity. Histamine has no other current clinical applications.

\section*{Toxicity \& Contraindications}

Adverse effects of histamine release, like those following administration of histamine, are dose-related. Flushing, hypotension, tachycardia, headache, wheals, bronchoconstriction, and gastrointestinal upset are noted. These effects are also observed after the ingestion of spoiled fish (scombroid fish poisoning), and there is evidence that histamine produced by bacterial action in the flesh of the fish is the major causative agent.

Histamine should not be given to patients with asthma (except as part of a carefully monitored test of pulmonary function) or to patients with active ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.

\section*{HI STAMI NE ANTAGONISTS}

The effects of histamine released in the body can be reduced in several ways. Physiologic antagonists, especially epinephrine, have smooth muscle actions opposite to those of histamine, but they act at different receptors. This is important clinically because injection of epinephrine can be lifesaving in systemic anaphylaxis and in other conditions in which massive release of histamine-and other mediators-occurs.

Release inhibitors reduce the degranulation of mast cells that results from immunologic triggering by antigen-IgE interaction. Cromolyn and nedocromil appear to have this effect (see Chapter 20) and are used in the treatment of asthma, though the molecular mechanism underlying their action is presently unknown. Beta2 -adrenoceptor agonists also appear capable of reducing histamine release.

Histamine receptor antagonists represent a third approach to the reduction of histamine-mediated responses. For over 60 years, compounds have been available that competitively antagonize many of the actions of histamine on smooth muscle. However, not until the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-receptor antagonist burimamide was described in 1972 was it possible to antagonize the gastric acid-stimulating activity of histamine. The development of selective $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-receptor antagonists has led to more effective therapy for peptic disease (see Chapter 63). Selective $\mathrm{H}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{4}$ antagonists are not yet available for clinical use. However, potent and selective experimental $\mathrm{H}_{3}$-receptor antagonists, thioperamide and clobenpropit, have been developed.

\section*{$\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{1}}$-RECEPTOR ANTAGONI STS}

Compounds that competitively block histamine at $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ receptors have been used in the treatment of allergic conditions for many years, and many $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists are currently marketed in the USA. Many are available without prescription, both alone and in combination formulations such as "cold pills" and sleep aids (see Chapter 64).

\section*{BASIC PHARMACOLOGY OF $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS}

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

The $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists are conveniently divided into first-generation and second-generation agents. These groups are distinguished by the relatively strong sedative effects of most of the first-generation drugs. The first-
generation agents are also more likely to block autonomic receptors. The relatively less sedating characteristic of the second-generation $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ blockers is due in part to their less complete distribution into the central nervous system. All of the $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists are stable amines with the general structure illustrated in Figure 16-1. Several chemical subgroups, and the structures of compounds representing different subgroups are shown in the figure. Doses of some of these drugs are given in Table 16-2.

These agents are rapidly absorbed following oral administration, with peak blood concentrations occurring in 1-2 hours. They are widely distributed throughout the body, and the first-generation drugs enter the central nervous system readily. Some of them are extensively metabolized, primarily by microsomal systems in the liver. Several of the second-generation agents are metabolized by the CYP3A4 system and thus are subject to important interactions when other drugs (such as ketoconazole) inhibit this subtype of P450 enzymes. Most of the drugs have an effective duration of action of 4-6 hours following a single dose, but meclizine and several second-generation agents are longer-acting, with a duration of action of 12-24 hours. The newer agents are considerably less lipid-soluble than the first-generation drugs and are substrates of the P-glycoprotein transporter in the blood-brain barrier; as a result they enter the central nervous system with difficulty or not at all. Many $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists have active metabolites. The active metabolites of hydroxyzine, terfenadine, and loratadine are available as drugs (cetirizine, fexofenadine, and desloratadine, respectively).

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

\section*{HISTAMI NE-RECEPTOR BLOCKADE}
$\mathrm{H}_{1}$-receptor antagonists block the actions of histamine by reversible competitive antagonism at the $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ receptor. They have negligible potency at the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor and little at the $\mathrm{H}_{3}$ receptor. For example, histamine-induced contraction of bronchiolar or gastrointestinal smooth muscle can be completely blocked by these agents, but the effects on gastric acid secretion and the heart are unmodified.

\section*{ACTIONS NOT CAUSED BY HI STAMI NE RECEPTOR BLOCKADE}

The first-generation $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-receptor antagonists have many actions not ascribable to blockade of the actions of histamine. The large number of these actions probably results from the similarity of the general structure (Figure 16-1) to the structure of drugs that have effects at muscarinic cholinoceptor, adrenoceptor, serotonin, and local anesthetic receptor sites. Some of these actions are of therapeutic value and some are undesirable.

\section*{Sedation}

A common effect of first-generation $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists is sedation, but the intensity of this effect varies among chemical subgroups (Table 16-2) and among patients as well. The effect is sufficiently prominent with some agents to make them useful as "sleep aids" (see Chapter 64) and unsuitable for daytime use. The effect resembles that of some antimuscarinic drugs and is considered very unlike the disinhibited sedation produced by sedative-hypnotic drugs. Compulsive use has not been reported. At ordinary dosages, children occasionally (and adults rarely) manifest excitation rather than sedation. At very high toxic dose levels, marked stimulation, agitation, and even convulsions may precede coma. Second-generation $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists have little or no sedative or stimulant actions. These drugs (or their active metabolites) also have far fewer autonomic effects than the first-generation antihistamines.

\section*{Antinausea and Antiemetic Actions}

Several first-generation $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists have significant activity in preventing motion sickness (Table 16-2). They are less effective against an episode of motion sickness already present. Certain $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists, notably doxylamine (in Bendectin), were used widely in the past in the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (see below).

\section*{Antiparkinsonism Effects}

Some of the $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists, especially diphenhydramine, have significant acute suppressant effects on the extrapyramidal symptoms associated with certain antipsychotic drugs. This drug is given parenterally for acute dystonic reactions to antipsychotics.

\section*{Anticholinoceptor Actions}

Many of the first-generation agents, especially those of the ethanolamine and ethylenediamine subgroups, have significant atropine-like effects on peripheral muscarinic receptors. This action may be responsible for some of the (uncertain) benefits reported for nonallergic rhinorrhea but may also cause urinary retention and blurred vision.

\section*{Adrenoceptor-Blocking Actions}

Alpha-receptor-blocking effects can be demonstrated for many $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists, especially those in the phenothiazine subgroup, eg, promethazine. This action may cause orthostatic hypotension in susceptible individuals. Beta-receptor blockade is not observed.

\section*{Serotonin-Blocking Action}

Strong blocking effects at serotonin receptors have been demonstrated for some first-generation $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists, notably cyproheptadine. This drug is promoted as an antiserotonin agent and is discussed with that drug group. Nevertheless, its structure resembles that of the phenothiazine antihistamines, and it is a potent $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-blocking agent.

\section*{Local Anesthesia}

Several first-generation $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists are potent local anesthetics. They block sodium channels in excitable membranes in the same fashion as procaine and lidocaine. Diphenhydramine and promethazine are actually more potent than procaine as local anesthetics. They are occasionally used to produce local anesthesia in patients allergic to conventional local anesthetic drugs. A small number of these agents also block potassium channels; this action is discussed below (see Toxicity).

\section*{Other Actions}

Certain $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists, eg, cetirizine, inhibit mast cell release of histamine and some other mediators of inflammation. This action is not due to $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-receptor blockade. The mechanism is not understood but could play a role in the beneficial effects of these drugs in the treatment of allergies such as rhinitis. A few $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists (eg, terfenadine, acrivastine) have been shown to inhibit the P-glycoprotein transporter found in cancer cells, the epithelium of the gut, and the capillaries of the brain. The significance of this effect is not known.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS}

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{ALLERGIC REACTIONS}

The $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antihistaminic agents are often the first drugs used to prevent or treat the symptoms of allergic reactions. In allergic rhinitis and urticaria, in which histamine is the primary mediator, the $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists are the drugs of choice and are often quite effective. However, in bronchial asthma, which involves several mediators, the $H_{1}$ antagonists are largely ineffective.

Angioedema may be precipitated by histamine release but appears to be maintained by peptide kinins that are not affected by antihistaminic agents. For atopic dermatitis, antihistaminic drugs such as diphenhydramine are used mostly for their sedative side effect, which reduces awareness of itching.

The $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antihistamines used for treating allergic conditions such as hay fever are usually selected with the goal of minimizing sedative effects; in the USA, the drugs in widest use are the alkylamines and the secondgeneration nonsedating agents. However, the sedative effect and the therapeutic efficacy of different agents vary widely among individuals. In addition, the clinical effectiveness of one group may diminish with continued use, and switching to another group may restore drug effectiveness for as yet unexplained reasons.

The second-generation $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists are used mainly for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria. Several double-blind comparisons with older agents (such as chlorpheniramine) indicated about equal therapeutic efficacy. However, sedation and interference with safe operation of machinery, which occur in about 50\% of subjects taking first-generation antihistamines, occurred in only about 7\% of subjects taking second-generation agents. The newer drugs are much more expensive.

\section*{MOTION SICKNESS AND VESTIBULAR DISTURBANCES}

Scopolamine (Chapter 8) and certain first-generation $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists are the most effective agents available for the prevention of motion sickness. The antihistaminic drugs with the greatest effectiveness in this application are diphenhydramine and promethazine. Dimenhydrinate, which is promoted almost exclusively for the treatment of motion sickness, is a salt of diphenhydramine. The piperazines (cyclizine and meclizine) also have significant activity in preventing motion sickness and are less sedating than diphenhydramine in most patients. Dosage is the same as that recommended for allergic disorders (Table 16-2). Both scopolamine and the $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists are more effective in preventing motion sickness when combined with ephedrine or amphetamine.

It has been claimed that the antihistaminic agents effective in prophylaxis of motion sickness are also useful in Ménière's syndrome, but efficacy in the latter application is not established.

\section*{NAUSEA AND VOMITING OF PREGNANCY}

Several $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-antagonist drugs have been studied for possible use in treating "morning sickness." The piperazine derivatives were withdrawn from such use when it was demonstrated that they have teratogenic effects in rodents. Doxylamine, an ethanolamine $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonist, was promoted for this application as a component of Bendectin, a prescription medication that also contained pyridoxine. Possible teratogenic effects of doxylamine were widely publicized in the lay press after 1978 as a result of a few case reports of fetal malformation associated with maternal ingestion of Bendectin. However, several large prospective studies involving over 60,000 pregnancies, of which more than 3000 involved maternal Bendectin ingestion, disclosed no increase in the incidence of birth defects. However, because of the continuing controversy, adverse publicity, and lawsuits, the manufacturer of Bendectin withdrew the product from the market.

\section*{Toxicity}

The wide spectrum of nonantihistaminic effects of the $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antihistamines is described in the previous text. Several of these effects (sedation, antimuscarinic action) have been used for therapeutic purposes, especially in over-the-counter (OTC) remedies (see Chapter 64). Nevertheless, these two effects constitute the most common undesirable actions when these drugs are used to block histamine receptors.

Less common toxic effects of systemic use include excitation and convulsions in children, postural hypotension, and allergic responses. Drug allergy is relatively common after topical use of $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists. The effects of severe systemic overdosage of the older agents resemble those of atropine overdosage and are treated in the same way (see Chapters 8 and 59). Overdosage of astemizole or terfenadine may induce cardiac arrhythmias, but these drugs are no longer marketed in the USA; the same effect may be caused at normal dosage by
interaction with enzyme inhibitors (see Drug Interactions, below).

\section*{Drug I nteractions}

Lethal ventricular arrhythmias occurred in several patients taking either of the early second-generation agents, terfenadine or astemizole, in combination with ketoconazole, itraconazole, or macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin. These antimicrobial drugs inhibit the metabolism of many drugs by CYP3A4 and cause significant increases in blood concentrations of the antihistamines. The mechanism of this toxicity involves blockade of the HERG ( $I_{\mathrm{Kr}}$ ) potassium channels in the heart that are responsible for repolarization of the action potential (see Chapter 14). The result is prolongation of the action potential, and excessive prolongation leads to arrhythmias. Both terfenadine and astemizole were withdrawn from the United States market in recognition of these problems. Where still available, terfenadine and astemizole should be considered to be contraindicated in patients taking ketoconazole, itraconazole, or macrolides and in patients with liver disease. Grapefruit juice also inhibits CYP3A4 and has been shown to increase terfenadine's blood levels significantly.

For those $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists that cause significant sedation, concurrent use of other drugs that cause central nervous system depression produces additive effects and is contraindicated while driving or operating machinery. Similarly, the autonomic blocking effects of older antihistamines are additive with those of muscarinic and a-blocking drugs.

\section*{$\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{2}}$-RECEPTOR ANTAGONI STS}

The development of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-receptor antagonists was based on the observation that $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ antagonists had no effect on histamine-induced acid secretion in the stomach. Molecular manipulation of the histamine molecule resulted in drugs that blocked acid secretion and had no $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-agonist or antagonist effects. The high incidence of peptic ulcer disease and related gastrointestinal complaints created great interest in the therapeutic potential of these $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-receptor antagonists. Because of the ability of this class of drugs to reduce gastric acid secretion and their low toxicity, they are now among the most frequently used drugs in the USA and have become OTC items. These drugs are discussed in Chapter 63.

\section*{$\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{3}}$ - \& $\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{4}}$-RECEPTOR ANTAGONI STS}

Although no selective $\mathrm{H}_{3}$ or $\mathrm{H}_{4}$ ligands are presently available for clinical use, there is great interest in their therapeutic potential. $\mathrm{H}_{3}$-selective ligands may be of value in sleep disorders, obesity, and cognitive and psychiatric disorders. $\mathrm{H}_{4}$ blockers have potential in chronic inflammatory conditions such as asthma, in which eosinophils and mast cells play a prominent role.

\section*{SEROTONIN (5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMI NE)}

Before the identification of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), it was known that when blood is allowed to clot, a vasoconstrictor (tonic) substance is released from the clot into the serum; this substance was called serotonin. Independent studies established the existence of a smooth muscle stimulant in intestinal mucosa; this was called enteramine. The synthesis of 5-hydroxytryptamine in 1951 permitted the identification of serotonin and enteramine as the same metabolite of 5-hydroxytryptophan.

Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter, a local hormone in the gut, a component of the platelet clotting process, and is thought to play a role in migraine headache. Serotonin is also one of the mediators of the signs
and symptoms of carcinoid syndrome, an unusual manifestation of carcinoid tumor, a neoplasm of enterochromaffin cells. In patients whose tumor is not operable, a serotonin antagonist may constitute a useful treatment.

\section*{BASIC PHARMACOLOGY OF SEROTONI N}

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Like histamine, serotonin is widely distributed in nature, being found in plant and animal tissues, venoms, and stings. It is an indoleethylamine formed in biologic systems from the amino acid L-tryptophan by hydroxylation of the indole ring followed by decarboxylation of the amino acid (Figure 16-2). Hydroxylation at C5 is the ratelimiting step and can be blocked by p- chlorophenylalanine (PCPA; fenclonine) and by p- chloroamphetamine. These agents have been used experimentally to reduce serotonin synthesis in carcinoid syndrome but are too toxic for clinical use.

Structures of serotonin and two 5-HT-receptor blockers.

After synthesis, the free amine is stored or is rapidly inactivated, usually by oxidation catalyzed by the enzyme
monoamine oxidase. In the pineal gland, serotonin serves as a precursor of melatonin, a melanocytestimulating hormone. In mammals (including humans), over $90 \%$ of the serotonin in the body is found in enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract. In the blood, serotonin is found in platelets, which are able to concentrate the amine by means of an active serotonin transporter mechanism (SERT) similar to that in the membrane of serotonergic nerve endings. Once transported into the platelet or nerve ending, 5 - HT is concentrated in vesicles by a vesicle-associated transporter (VAT) that is blocked by reserpine. Serotonin is also found in the raphe nuclei of the brainstem, which contain cell bodies of serotonergic neurons that synthesize, store, and release serotonin as a transmitter. Brain serotonergic neurons are involved in numerous diffuse functions such as mood, sleep, appetite, and temperature regulation, as well as the perception of pain, the regulation of blood pressure, and vomiting (see Chapter 21). Serotonin also appears to be involved in clinical conditions such as depression, anxiety, and migraine. Serotonergic neurons are also found in the enteric nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract and around blood vessels. In rodents (but not in humans), serotonin is found in mast cells.

The function of serotonin in enterochromaffin cells is not fully understood. These cells synthesize serotonin, store the amine in a complex with ATP and with other substances in granules, and release serotonin in response to mechanical and neuronal stimuli. Some of the released serotonin diffuses into blood vessels and is taken up and stored in platelets.

Stored serotonin can be depleted by reserpine in much the same manner as this drug depletes catecholamines from vesicles in adrenergic nerves (see Chapter 6).

Serotonin is metabolized by monoamine oxidase, and the intermediate product, 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde, is further oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( $5-\mathrm{HIAA}$ ). In humans consuming a normal diet, the excretion of 5-HIAA is a measure of serotonin synthesis. Therefore, the 24-hour excretion of 5-HIAA can be used as a diagnostic test for tumors that synthesize excessive quantities of serotonin, especially carcinoid tumor. A few foods (eg, bananas) contain large amounts of serotonin or its precursors and must be prohibited during such diagnostic tests.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

\section*{MECHANI SMS OF ACTION}

Serotonin exerts many actions and, like histamine, has many species differences, making generalizations difficult. The actions of serotonin are mediated through a remarkably large number of cell membrane receptors. The serotonin receptors that have been characterized thus far are listed in Table 16-3. Seven families of 5-HT-receptor subtypes (those given numeric subscripts 1 through 7) have been identified, six involving G protein-coupled receptors of the usual 7-transmembrane serpentine type and one a ligand-gated ion channel. Among these receptor subtypes, a few still lack a well-documented physiologic function. Discovery of these functions awaits the development of more subtype-selective drugs or the knockout mutation of genes encoding these receptors from the mouse genome.

\section*{TISSUE AND ORGAN SYSTEM EFFECTS}

\section*{Nervous System}

Serotonin is present in a variety of sites in the brain. Its role as a neurotransmitter and its relation to the actions of drugs acting in the central nervous system are discussed in Chapters 21 and 30. Serotonin is also a precursor of melatonin in the pineal gland (see Melatonin Pharmacology, and Chapter 65).

\section*{MELATONIN PHARMACOLOGY}

Melatonin is N -acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, a simple methoxylated and N-acetylated product of serotonin found in the pineal gland. It is produced and released primarily at night and has long been suspected of playing a role in diurnal cycles of animals and the sleep-wake behavior of humans.

Melatonin receptors have been characterized in the central nervous system and several peripheral tissues. In the brain, $M T_{1}$ and $M T_{2}$ receptors are found in membranes of neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, an area associated-from lesioning experiments-with circadian rhythm. MT ${ }_{1}$ and MT ${ }_{2}$ are seven-transmembrane $G_{i}$ protein-coupled receptors. The result of receptor binding is inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. A third receptor, $\mathrm{MT}_{3}$, is an enzyme; binding to this site has a poorly defined physiologic role, possibly related to intraocular pressure. Activation of the $\mathrm{MT}_{1}$ receptor results in sleepiness, whereas the $\mathrm{MT}_{2}$ receptor may be related to the light-dark synchronization of the biologic circadian clock.

Melatonin itself is promoted commercially as a sleep aid by the food supplement industry (see Chapter 65). Ramelteon is a selective $\mathrm{MT}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{MT}_{2}$ agonist that has recently been approved for the medical treatment of insomnia. This drug has no addiction liability (it is not a controlled substance), and it appears to be distinctly more efficacious than melatonin (but less efficacious than benzodiazepines) as a hypnotic. It is metabolized by P450 enzymes and should not be used in individuals taking CYP1A2 inhibitors. It has a half-life of 1-3 hours and an active metabolite with a half-life of up to 5 hours. The toxicity of ramelteon is as yet poorly defined, but prolactin levels were elevated in one clinical trial.

5- $\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptors in the gastrointestinal tract and in the vomiting center of the medulla participate in the vomiting reflex (see Chapter 63). They are particularly important in vomiting caused by chemical triggers such as cancer chemotherapy drugs. $5-\mathrm{HT}_{1 \mathrm{P}}$ and $5-\mathrm{HT}_{4}$ receptors also play a role in enteric nervous system function.

Like histamine, serotonin is a potent stimulant of pain and itch sensory nerve endings and is responsible for some of the symptoms caused by insect and plant stings. In addition, serotonin is a powerful activator of chemosensitive endings located in the coronary vascular bed. Activation of $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptors on these afferent vagal nerve endings is associated with the chemoreceptor reflex (also known as the Bezold-J arisch reflex). The reflex response consists of marked bradycardia and hypotension. The bradycardia is mediated by vagal outflow to the heart and can be blocked by atropine. The hypotension is a consequence of the decrease in cardiac output that results from bradycardia. A variety of other agents can activate the chemoreceptor reflex. These include nicotinic cholinoceptor agonists and some cardiac glycosides, eg, ouabain.

\section*{Respiratory System}

Serotonin has a small direct stimulant effect on bronchiolar smooth muscle in normal humans. It also appears to facilitate acetylcholine release from bronchial vagal nerve endings. In patients with carcinoid syndrome, episodes of bronchoconstriction occur in response to elevated levels of the amine or peptides released from the tumor. Serotonin may also cause hyperventilation as a result of the chemoreceptor reflex or stimulation of bronchial sensory nerve endings.

\section*{Cardiovascular System}

Serotonin directly causes the contraction of vascular smooth muscle, mainly through $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ receptors. In humans, serotonin is a powerful vasoconstrictor except in skeletal muscle and heart, where it dilates blood vessels. At least part of this 5-HT-induced vasodilation requires the presence of vascular endothelial cells. When the endothelium is damaged, coronary vessels constrict. As noted previously, serotonin can also elicit reflex bradycardia by activation of $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptors on chemoreceptor nerve endings. A triphasic blood pressure response is often seen following injection of serotonin in experimental animals. Initially, there is a decrease in heart rate, cardiac output, and blood pressure caused by the chemoreceptor response. Following this decrease, blood pressure increases as a result of vasoconstriction. The third phase is again a decrease in
blood pressure attributed to vasodilation in vessels supplying skeletal muscle. Pulmonary and renal vessels seem especially sensitive to the vasoconstrictor action of serotonin.

Serotonin also constricts veins, and venoconstriction with a resulting increased capillary filling appears to be responsible for the flush that is observed following serotonin administration or release from a carcinoid tumor. Serotonin has small direct positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the heart, which are probably of no clinical significance. However, prolonged elevation of the blood level of serotonin (which occurs in carcinoid syndrome) is associated with pathologic alterations in the endocardium (subendocardial fibroplasia), which may result in valvular or electrical malfunction.

Serotonin causes blood platelets to aggregate by activating surface $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ receptors. This response, in contrast to aggregation induced during clot formation, is not accompanied by the release of serotonin stored in the platelets. The physiologic role of this effect is unclear.

\section*{Gastrointestinal Tract}

Serotonin is a powerful stimulant of gastrointestinal smooth muscle, increasing tone and facilitating peristalsis. This action is caused by the direct action of serotonin on $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ smooth muscle receptors plus a stimulating action on ganglion cells located in the enteric nervous system (see Chapter 6). Activation of $5-\mathrm{HT}_{4}$ receptors in the enteric nervous system causes increased acetylcholine release and thereby mediates a motility-enhancing or "prokinetic" effect of selective serotonin agonists such as cisapride. These agents are useful in several gastrointestinal disorders (see Chapter 63). Overproduction of serotonin (and other substances) in carcinoid tumor is associated with severe diarrhea. Serotonin has little effect on secretions, and what effects it has are generally inhibitory.

\section*{Skeletal Muscle}

5- $\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ receptors are present on skeletal muscle membranes, but their physiologic role is not understood.
Serotonin syndrome is a condition precipitated when MAO inhibitors are given with serotonin agonists, especially antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor class (SSRIs; see Chapter 30). Although associated with skeletal muscle contractions and the hyperthermia resulting from excessive muscle contraction, serotonin syndrome is probably the result of a central nervous system effect of these drugs (see Table 16-4 and Serotonin Syndrome and Similar Syndromes).

\section*{SEROTONIN SYNDROME AND SIMI LAR SYNDROMES}

Excess synaptic serotonin causes a serious, potentially fatal syndrome that is diagnosed on the basis of a history of administration of a serotonergic drug within recent weeks and physical findings (Table 16-4). It has some characteristics in common with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and malignant hyperthermia (MH), but its pathophysiology and management are quite different.

As suggested by the drugs that precipitate it, serotonin syndrome occurs when overdose with a single drug, or concurrent use of several drugs, results in excess serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. It is predictable and not idiosyncratic, but milder forms may easily be misdiagnosed. In experimental animal models, many of the signs of the syndrome can be reversed by administration of $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ antagonists; however, other 5-HT receptors may be involved as well. Dantrolene is of no value, unlike the treatment of MH. NMS is idiosyncratic rather than predictable and appears to be associated with hypersensitivity to the parkinsonisminducing effects of $\mathrm{D}_{2}$-blocking antipsychotics in certain individuals. MH is associated with a genetic defect in the RyR1 calcium channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum that permits uncontrolled calcium release from the SR when precipitating drugs are given (Chapter 27).

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF SEROTONI N}

\section*{Serotonin Agonists}

Serotonin has no clinical applications as a drug. However, several receptor subtype-selective agonists have proved to be of value. Buspirone, a $5-\mathrm{HT}_{1 \mathrm{~A}}$ agonist, has received wide attention for its usefulness as an effective nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic (see Chapter 22). Dexfenfluramine, another selective 5-HT agonist, was widely used as an appetite suppressant but was withdrawn because of toxicity. Appetite suppression appears to be associated with agonist action at $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2} \mathrm{C}$ receptors in the central nervous system. Sumatriptan and its congeners are agonists effective in the treatment of acute migraine and cluster headache attacks (see below).

\section*{5-HT1D/1в Agonists \& Migraine Headache}

The 5-HT ${ }_{1 \mathrm{D} / 1 \mathrm{~B}}$ agonists (triptans) are used almost exclusively in migraine headache. Migraine in its "classic" form is characterized by an aura of variable duration that may involve nausea, vomiting, and visual scotomas or even hemianopsia and speech abnormalities; followed by a severe throbbing unilateral headache that lasts for a few hours to 1-2 days. "Common" migraine lacks the aura phase, but the headache is similar. Although the symptom pattern varies among patients, the severity of migraine headache justifies vigorous therapy in the great majority of cases.

Migraine involves the trigeminal nerve distribution to intracranial (and possibly extracranial) arteries. These nerves release peptide neurotransmitters, especially calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; see Chapter 17), an extremely powerful vasodilator. Substance $P$ and neurokinin A may also be involved. Extravasation of plasma and plasma proteins into the perivascular space appears to be a common feature of animal migraine models and biopsy specimens from migraine patients and probably represents the effect of the neuropeptides on the vessels. The mechanical stretching caused by this perivascular edema may be the immediate cause of activation of pain nerve endings in the dura. The onset of headache is sometimes associated with a marked increase in amplitude of temporal artery pulsations, and relief of pain by administration of effective therapy is sometimes accompanied by diminution of the arterial pulsations.

The mechanisms of action of drugs used in migraine are poorly understood, in part because they include such a wide variety of drug groups and actions. In addition to the triptans, these include ergot alkaloids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic agents, B-adrenoceptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs, and several antiseizure agents. Furthermore, some of these drug groups are effective only for prophylaxis and not for the acute attack.

Two primary hypotheses have been proposed to explain the actions of these drugs. First, the triptans, the ergot alkaloids, and antidepressants may activate $5-\mathrm{HT}_{1 \mathrm{D} / 1 \mathrm{~B}}$ receptors on presynaptic trigeminal nerve endings to inhibit the release of vasodilating peptides, and antiseizure agents may suppress excessive firing of these nerve endings. Second, the vasoconstrictor actions of direct 5-HT agonists (the triptans and ergot) may prevent vasodilation and stretching of the pain endings. It is possible that both mechanisms contribute in the case of some drugs. Sumatriptan and its congeners are currently first-line therapy for acute severe migraine attacks in most patients. However, they should not be used in patients at risk for coronary artery disease. Anti-inflammatory analgesics such as aspirin and ibuprofen are often helpful in controlling the pain of migraine. Rarely, parenteral opioids may be needed in refractory cases. For patients with very severe nausea and vomiting, parenteral metoclopramide may be helpful.

Propranolol, amitriptyline, and some calcium channel blockers have been found to be effective for the prophylaxis of migraine in some patients. They are of no value in the treatment of acute migraine. The anticonvulsants valproic acid and topiramate (see Chapter 24) have recently been found to have good prophylactic efficacy in many migraine patients. Flunarizine, a calcium channel blocker used in Europe, has been reported in clinical trials to effectively reduce the severity of the acute attack and to prevent recurrences. Verapamil appears to have modest efficacy as prophylaxis against migraine.

Sumatriptan and the other triptans are selective agonists for 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B receptors; the similarity of the triptan structure to that of 5-HT can be seen in the structure below. These receptor types are found in cerebral and meningeal vessels and mediate vasoconstriction. They are also found on neurons and probably function as presynaptic inhibitory receptors.
<smiles>CN[SeH](=O)(O)Cc1ccc2[nH]cc(CCN(C)C)c2c1</smiles>

Sumatriptan
The efficacy of triptan $5-\mathrm{HT}_{1}$ agonists in migraine is equal to or greater than that of other acute drug treatments, eg, parenteral, oral, or rectal ergot alkaloids. The pharmacokinetics of the triptans are set forth in Table 16-5. Most adverse effects are mild and include altered sensations (tingling, warmth, etc), dizziness, muscle weakness, neck pain, and for parenteral sumatriptan, injection site reactions. Chest discomfort occurs in 1-5\% of patients, and chest pain has been reported, probably because of the ability of these drugs to cause coronary vasospasm. They are therefore contraindicated in patients with coronary artery disease and in patients with angina. Another disadvantage is the fact that their duration of effect (especially that of almotriptan, sumatriptan, rizatriptan, and zolmitriptan, Table 16-5) is often shorter than the duration of the headache. As a result, several doses may be required during a prolonged migraine attack, but their adverse effects limit the maximum safe daily dosage. In addition, these drugs are extremely expensive. Naratriptan and eletriptan are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment or peripheral vascular syndromes; frovatriptan in patients with peripheral vascular disease; and zolmitriptan in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

\section*{Other Serotonin Agonists in Clinical Use}

Cisapride, a $5-\mathrm{HT}_{4}$ agonist, was used in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux and motility disorders. Because of toxicity, it is now available only for compassionate use in the USA. Tegaserod, a newer 5-HT4 partial agonist, is used for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. These drugs are discussed in Chapter 63.

Compounds such as fluoxetine and other SSRIs, which modulate serotonergic transmission by blocking reuptake of the transmitter, are among the most widely prescribed drugs for the management of depression and similar disorders. These drugs are discussed in Chapter 30.

\section*{SEROTONI N ANTAGONI STS}

The actions of serotonin, like those of histamine, can be antagonized in several ways. Such antagonism is clearly desirable in those rare patients who have carcinoid tumor and may also be valuable in certain other conditions.

As noted above, serotonin synthesis can be inhibited by p- chlorophenylalanine and p- chloroamphetamine. However, these agents are too toxic for general use. Storage of serotonin can be inhibited by the use of reserpine, but the sympatholytic effects of this drug (see Chapter 11) and the high levels of circulating serotonin that result from release prevent its use in carcinoid. Therefore, receptor blockade is the major approach to therapeutic limitation of serotonin effects.

\section*{SEROTONI N-RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS}

A wide variety of drugs with actions at other receptors (c. adrenoceptors, $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-histamine receptors, etc) are also serotonin receptor-blocking agents. Phenoxybenzamine (see Chapter 10) has a long-lasting blocking action at $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ receptors. In addition, the ergot alkaloids discussed in the last portion of the chapter are partial agonists at serotonin receptors.

Cyproheptadine resembles the phenothiazine antihistaminic agents in chemical structure and has potent $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ -receptor-blocking as well as $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$-blocking actions. The actions of cyproheptadine are predictable from its $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ histamine and serotonin receptor affinities. It prevents the smooth muscle effects of both amines but has no effect on the gastric secretion stimulated by histamine. It also has significant antimuscarinic effects and causes sedation.

The major clinical applications of cyproheptadine are in the treatment of the smooth muscle manifestations of carcinoid tumor and in cold-induced urticaria. The usual dosage in adults is $12-16 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ in three or four divided doses. It is of some value in serotonin syndrome, but because it is available only in tablet form, it must be crushed and administered by stomach tube in unconscious patients.

Ketanserin (Figure 16-2) blocks $5-\mathrm{HT}_{1 \mathrm{c}}$ and $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ receptors and has little or no reported antagonist activity at other 5-HT or $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ receptors. However, this drug potently blocks vascular $\alpha_{1}$ adrenoceptors. The drug blocks $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ receptors on platelets and antagonizes platelet aggregation promoted by serotonin. The mechanism involved in ketanserin's hypotensive action is not clear but probably involves $\alpha_{1}$ adrenoceptors more than 5$\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ receptor blockade. Ketanserin is available in Europe for the treatment of hypertension and vasospastic conditions but has not been approved in the USA.

Ritanserin, another 5-HT2 antagonist, has little or no a-blocking action. It has been reported to alter bleeding time and to reduce thromboxane formation, presumably by altering platelet function.

Ondansetron (Figure 16-2) is the prototypical $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ antagonist. This drug and its analogs are very important in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with surgery and cancer chemotherapy. They are discussed in Chapter 63.

Considering the diverse effects attributed to serotonin and the heterogeneous nature of 5-HT receptors, other selective 5-HT antagonists may prove to be clinically useful.

\section*{THE ERGOT ALKALOI DS}

Ergot alkaloids are produced by Claviceps purpurea, a fungus that infects grain-especially rye-under damp growing or storage conditions. This fungus synthesizes histamine, acetylcholine, tyramine, and other biologically active products in addition to a score or more of unique ergot alkaloids. These alkaloids affect as. adrenoceptors, dopamine receptors, 5-HT receptors, and perhaps other receptor types. Similar alkaloids are produced by fungi parasitic to a number of other grass-like plants.

The accidental ingestion of ergot alkaloids in contaminated grain can be traced back more than 2000 years from descriptions of epidemics of ergot poisoning (ergotism). The most dramatic effects of poisoning are dementia with florid hallucinations; prolonged vasospasm, which may result in gangrene; and stimulation of uterine smooth muscle, which in pregnancy may result in abortion. In medieval times, ergot poisoning was called St. Anthony's fire after the saint whose help was sought in relieving the burning pain of vasospastic ischemia. Identifiable epidemics have occurred sporadically up to modern times (see Ergot Poisoning: Not Just an Ancient Disease) and mandate continuous surveillance of all grains used for food. Poisoning of grazing animals is common in many areas because the fungi may grow on pasture grasses.

In addition to the effects noted above, the ergot alkaloids produce a variety of other central nervous system and peripheral effects. Detailed structure-activity analysis and appropriate semisynthetic modifications have yielded a large number of agents with documented or potential clinical value.

\section*{ERGOT POI SONI NG: NOT J UST AN ANCI ENT DI SEASE}

As noted in the text, epidemics of ergotism, or poisoning by ergot-contaminated grain, are known to have occurred sporadically in ancient times and through the Middle Ages. It is easy to imagine the social chaos that might result if fiery pain, gangrene, hallucinations, convulsions, and abortions occurred simultaneously throughout a community in which all or most of the people believed in witchcraft, demonic possession, and the visitation of supernatural punishments upon humans for their misdeeds. Such beliefs are uncommon in most cultures today. However, ergotism has not disappeared. A most convincing demonstration of ergotism occurred in the small French village of Pont-Saint-Esprit in 1951. It was described in the British Medical Journal in 1951 (Gabbai et al, 1951) and in a later book-length narrative account (Fuller, 1968). Several hundred individuals suffered symptoms of hallucinations, convulsions, and ischemia-and several died-after eating bread made from contaminated flour. Similar events have occurred even more recently when poverty, famine, or incompetence resulted in the consumption of contaminated grain. Ergot toxicity caused by excessive selfmedication with pharmaceutical ergot preparations is still occasionally reported.

\section*{BASIC PHARMACOLOGY OF ERGOT ALKALOI DS}

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

Two major families of compounds that incorporate the tetracyclic ergoline nucleus may be identified; the amine alkaloids and the peptide alkaloids (Table 16-6). Drugs of therapeutic and toxicologic importance are
found in both groups.

The ergot alkaloids are variably absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The oral dose of ergotamine is about ten times larger than the intramuscular dose, but the speed of absorption and peak blood levels after oral administration can be improved by administration with caffeine (see below). The amine alkaloids are also absorbed from the rectum and the buccal cavity and after administration by aerosol inhaler. Absorption after intramuscular injection is slow but usually reliable. Bromocriptine and the amine derivative cabergoline are well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

The ergot alkaloids are extensively metabolized in the body. The primary metabolites are hydroxylated in the A
ring, and peptide alkaloids are also modified in the peptide moiety.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

\section*{MECHANI SM OF ACTION}

As suggested, the ergot alkaloids act on several types of receptors. Their effects include agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist actions at a-adrenoceptors and serotonin receptors (especially 5-HT ${ }_{1 \mathrm{~A}}$ and 5-HT ${ }_{1 \mathrm{D}}$; less for $5-\mathrm{HT}_{1 \mathrm{C}}, 5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$, and $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ ); and agonist or partial agonist actions at central nervous system dopamine receptors (Table 16-7). Furthermore, some members of the ergot family have a high affinity for presynaptic receptors, whereas others are more selective for postjunctional receptors. There is a powerful stimulant effect on the uterus that seems to be most closely associated with agonist or partial agonist effects at $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ receptors. Structural variations increase the selectivity of certain members of the family for specific receptor types.

\section*{ORGAN SYSTEM EFFECTS}

\section*{Central Nervous System}

As indicated by traditional descriptions of ergotism, certain of the naturally occurring alkaloids are powerful hallucinogens. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; "acid") is a synthetic ergot compound that clearly demonstrates this action. The drug has been used in the laboratory as a potent peripheral $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ antagonist, but good evidence suggests that its behavioral effects are mediated by agonist effects at prejunctional or postjunctional $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ receptors in the central nervous system. In spite of extensive research, no clinical value has been discovered for LSD's dramatic central nervous system effects. Abuse of this drug has waxed and waned but is still widespread. It is discussed in Chapter 32.

Dopamine receptors in the central nervous system play important roles in extrapyramidal motor control and the regulation of pituitary prolactin release. The actions of the peptide ergoline bromocriptine on the extrapyramidal system are discussed in Chapter 28. Of all the currently available ergot derivatives, bromocriptine, cabergoline, and pergolide have the highest selectivity for the pituitary dopamine receptors. These drugs directly suppress prolactin secretion from pituitary cells by activating regulatory dopamine receptors (Chapter 37). They compete for binding to these sites with dopamine itself and with other dopamine agonists such as apomorphine.

\section*{Vascular Smooth Muscle}

The action of ergot alkaloids on vascular smooth muscle is drug-, species-, and vessel-dependent, so few generalizations are possible. Ergotamine and related compounds potently constrict most human blood vessels in a predictable, and prolonged manner (Figure 16-3). This response is partially blocked by conventional a.blocking agents. However, ergotamine's effect is also associated with "epinephrine reversal" (see Chapter 10) and with blockade of the response to other cagonists. This dual effect represents partial agonist action (Table 16-7). Because ergotamine dissociates very slowly from the areceptor, it produces very long-lasting agonist and antagonist effects at this receptor. There is little or no effect at Badrenoceptors.
Figure 16-3.

Effects of ergot derivatives on contraction of isolated segments of human basilar artery strips removed at surgery. All of the ergot derivatives are partial agonists, and all are more potent than the full agonists, norepinephrine and serotonin. (NE, norepinephrine; 5-HT, serotonin; ERG, ergotamine; MT, methylergometrine; DHE, dihydroergotamine; MS, methysergide.) (Modified and reproduced, with permission, from Müller-Schweinitzer E. In: 5-Hydroxytryptamine Mechanisms in Primary Headaches. Oleson J, Saxena PR [editors]. Raven Press, 1992.)

While much of the vasoconstriction elicited by ergot alkaloids can be ascribed to partial agonist effects at $\alpha$. adrenoceptors, some may be the result of effects at 5-HT receptors. Ergotamine, ergonovine, and methysergide all have partial agonist effects at $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ vascular receptors. The remarkably specific antimigraine action of the ergot derivatives was originally thought to be related to their actions on vascular serotonin receptors. Current hypotheses, however, emphasize their action on prejunctional neuronal 5-HT receptors.

After overdosage with ergotamine and similar agents, vasospasm is severe and prolonged (see Toxicity, below). This vasospasm is not easily reversed by cantagonists, serotonin antagonists, or combinations of both.

Ergotamine is typical of the ergot alkaloids that have a strong vasoconstrictor spectrum of action. The hydrogenation of ergot alkaloids at the 9 and 10 positions (Table 16-6) yields dihydro derivatives that have reduced serotonin partial agonist effects and increased selective areceptor-blocking actions.

\section*{Uterine Smooth Muscle}

The stimulant action of ergot alkaloids on the uterus, as on vascular smooth muscle, appears to combine a. agonist, serotonin, and other effects. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the uterus to the stimulant effects of ergot increases dramatically during pregnancy, perhaps because of increasing dominance of $x_{1}$ receptors as pregnancy progresses. As a result, the uterus at term is more sensitive to ergot than earlier in pregnancy and far more sensitive than the nonpregnant organ.

In very small doses, ergot preparations can evoke rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the uterus. At higher concentrations, these drugs induce powerful and prolonged contracture. Ergonovine is more selective than other ergot alkaloids in affecting the uterus and is the agent of choice in obstetric applications of these drugs.

\section*{Other Smooth Muscle Organs}

In most patients, the ergot alkaloids have little or no significant effect on bronchiolar or urinary smooth
muscle. The gastrointestinal tract, on the other hand, is quite sensitive in most patients. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may be induced even by low doses in some patients. The effect is consistent with action on the central nervous system emetic center and on gastrointestinal serotonin receptors.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF ERGOT ALKALOI DS}

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{MI GRAI NE}

Ergot derivatives are highly specific for migraine pain; they are not analgesic for any other condition. Although the triptan drugs discussed above are preferred by most clinicians and patients, traditional therapy with ergotamine can also be quite effective when given during the prodrome of an attack; it becomes progressively less effective if delayed. Ergotamine tartrate is available for oral, sublingual, rectal suppository, and inhaler use. It is often combined with caffeine ( 100 mg caffeine for each 1 mg ergotamine tartrate) to facilitate absorption of the ergot alkaloid.

The vasoconstriction induced by ergotamine is long-lasting and cumulative when the drug is taken repeatedly, as in a severe migraine attack. Therefore, patients must be carefully informed that no more than 6 mg of the oral preparation may be taken for each attack and no more than 10 mg per week. For very severe attacks, ergotamine tartrate, $\mathbf{0 . 2 5 - 0 . 5 ~ m g}$, may be given intravenously or intramuscularly. Dihydroergotamine, $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg}$ intravenously, is favored by some clinicians for treatment of intractable migraine. Intranasal dihydroergotamine may also be effective.

\section*{HYPERPROLACTINEMIA}

Increased serum levels of the anterior pituitary hormone prolactin are associated with secreting tumors of the gland and also with the use of centrally acting dopamine antagonists, especially the $\mathrm{D}_{2}$-blocking antipsychotic drugs. Because of negative feedback effects, hyperprolactinemia is associated with amenorrhea and infertility in women as well as galactorrhea in both sexes.

Bromocriptine is extremely effective in reducing the high levels of prolactin that result from pituitary tumors and has even been associated with regression of the tumor in some cases. The usual dosage of bromocriptine is 2.5 mg two or three times daily. Cabergoline is similar but more potent. Bromocriptine has also been used in the same dosage to suppress physiologic lactation. However, serious postpartum cardiovascular toxicity has been reported in association with the latter use of bromocriptine or pergolide, and this application is discouraged (Chapter 37).

\section*{POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE}

The uterus at term is extremely sensitive to the stimulant action of ergot, and even moderate doses produce a prolonged and powerful spasm of the muscle quite unlike natural labor. Therefore, ergot derivatives should be used only for control of late uterine bleeding and should never be given before delivery. Oxytocin is the preferred agent for control of postpartum hemorrhage, but if this peptide agent is ineffective, ergonovine maleate, 0.2 mg usually given intramuscularly, can be tried. It is usually effective within 1-5 minutes and is less toxic than other ergot derivatives for this application. It is given at the time of delivery of the placenta or immediately afterward if bleeding is significant.

\section*{DIAGNOSIS OF VARIANT ANGINA}

Ergonovine given intravenously produces prompt vasoconstriction during coronary angiography to diagnose variant angina if reactive segments of the coronaries are present.

\section*{SENILE CEREBRAL INSUFFICIENCY}

Dihydroergotoxine, a mixture of dihydro-a-ergocryptine and three similar dihydrogenated peptide ergot alkaloids (ergoloid mesylates), has been promoted for many years for the relief of senility and more recently for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. There is no useful evidence that this drug has significant benefit.

\section*{Toxicity \& Contraindications}

The most common toxic effects of the ergot derivatives are gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Activation of the medullary vomiting center and of the gastrointestinal serotonin receptors is involved. Since migraine attacks are often associated with these symptoms before therapy is begun, these adverse effects are rarely contraindications to the use of ergot.

A more dangerous toxic effect of overdosage with agents like ergotamine and ergonovine is prolonged vasospasm. As described above, this sign of vascular smooth muscle stimulation may result in gangrene and require amputation. Bowel infarction has also been reported and may require resection. Peripheral vascular vasospasm caused by ergot is refractory to most vasodilators, but infusions of large doses of nitroprusside or nitroglycerin have been successful in some cases.

Chronic therapy with methysergide was associated with connective tissue proliferation in the retroperitoneal space, the pleural cavity, and the endocardial tissue of the heart. These changes occurred insidiously over months and presented as hydronephrosis (from obstruction of the ureters) or a cardiac murmur (from distortion of the valves of the heart). In some cases, valve damage required surgical replacement. As a result, this drug was withdrawn. Similar fibrotic change has resulted from the chronic use of 5-HT agonists promoted in the past for weight loss (fenfluramine, desfenfluramine).

Other toxic effects of the ergot alkaloids include drowsiness and, in the case of methysergide, occasional instances of central stimulation and hallucinations. In fact, methysergide was sometimes used as a substitute for LSD by members of the "drug culture."

Contraindications to the use of ergot derivatives consist of the obstructive vascular diseases and collagen diseases.

There is no evidence that ordinary use of ergotamine for migraine is hazardous in pregnancy. However, most clinicians counsel restraint in the use of the ergot derivatives by pregnant patients.

\section*{VASOACTI VE PEPTI DES: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Peptides are used by most tissues for cell-to-cell communication. As noted in Chapters 6 and 21, they play important roles in the autonomic and central nervous systems. Several peptides exert important direct effects on vascular and other smooth muscles. These peptides include vasoconstrictors (angiotensin II, vasopressin, endothelins, neuropeptide Y, and urotensin) and vasodilators (bradykinin and related kinins, natriuretic peptides, vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P, neurotensin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and adrenomedullin). This chapter focuses on the smooth muscle actions of the peptides.

\section*{ANGIOTENSIN BIOSYNTHESIS OF ANGI OTENSI N}

The pathway for the formation and metabolism of angiotensin II is summarized in Figure 17-1. The principal steps include enzymatic cleavage of angiotensin I from angiotensinogen by renin, conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by converting enzyme, and degradation of angiotensin II by several peptidases.

Chemistry of the renin-angiotensin system. The amino acid sequence of the amino terminal of human angiotensinogen is shown. R denotes the remainder of the protein molecule. See text for additional steps in the formation and metabolism of angiotensin peptides.

\section*{Renin \& Factors Controlling Renin Secretion}

Renin is an aspartyl protease that specifically catalyzes the hydrolytic release of the decapeptide angiotensin I from angiotensinogen. It is synthesized as a preprohormone that is processed to prorenin, which is inactive, and then to active renin, a glycoprotein consisting of 340 amino acids.

Renin in the circulation originates in the kidneys. Enzymes with renin-like activity are present in several extrarenal tissues, including blood vessels, uterus, salivary glands, and adrenal cortex, but no physiologic role for these enzymes has been established. Within the kidney, renin is synthesized and stored in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the nephron. Specialized granular cells called juxtaglomerular cells are the site of synthesis, storage, and release of renin. The macula densa is a specialized segment of the nephron that is closely associated with the vascular components of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. The vascular and tubular components of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, including the juxtaglomerular cells, are innervated by noradrenergic neurons.

The rate at which renin is secreted by the kidney is the primary determinant of activity of the reninangiotensin system. Active renin is released immediately upon stimulation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. Prorenin is released constitutively and, for unknown reasons, circulates at levels that can be considerably higher than those of active renin. Active renin secretion is controlled by a variety of factors, including a renal vascular receptor, the macula densa, the sympathetic nervous system, and angiotensin II.

\section*{RENAL VASCULAR RECEPTOR}

The renal vascular receptor functions as a stretch receptor, with decreased stretch leading to increased renin release and vice versa. The receptor is apparently located in the afferent arteriole, possibly in the juxtaglomerular cells. Stretch-induced changes in renin release are mediated by changes in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration in the juxtaglomerular cells.

\section*{MACULA DENSA}

The macula densa contains a different type of receptor, sensitive to changes in the rate of delivery of sodium or chloride to the distal tubule. Decreases in distal delivery result in stimulation of renin secretion and vice versa. Potential candidates for signal transmission between the macula densa and the juxtaglomerular cells include adenosine, prostaglandins, and nitric oxide.

\section*{SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM}

Maneuvers that increase renal nerve activity cause stimulation of renin secretion, whereas renal denervation results in suppression of renin secretion. Norepinephrine stimulates renin secretion by a direct action on the juxtaglomerular cells. In humans, this effect is mediated by $B_{1}$ adrenoceptors.

Circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine may act via the same mechanisms as the norepinephrine released locally from the renal sympathetic nerves, but there is evidence that a major component of the renin secretory response to circulating catecholamines is mediated by extrarenal Breceptors.

\section*{ANGIOTENSI N}

Angiotensin II inhibits renin secretion. The inhibition, which results from a direct action of the peptide on the juxtaglomerular cells, forms the basis of a short-loop negative feedback mechanism controlling renin secretion. Interruption of this feedback with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (see below) results in stimulation of renin secretion.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC ALTERATION OF RENIN RELEASE}

The release of renin is altered by a wide variety of pharmacologic agents. Renin release is stimulated by vasodilators (hydralazine, minoxidil, nitroprusside), B-adrenoceptor agonists (isoproterenol), aadrenoceptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (theophylline, milrinone, rolipram), and most diuretics and anesthetics. This stimulation can be accounted for by the control mechanisms just described. Drugs that inhibit renin release are discussed below in the section on Inhibition of the Renin-Angiotensin System.

\section*{Angiotensinogen}

Angiotensinogen is the circulating protein substrate from which renin cleaves angiotensin I. It is synthesized in the liver. Human angiotensinogen is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 57,000 . The 14 amino acids at the amino terminal of the molecule are shown in Figure 17-1. In humans, the concentration of angiotensinogen in the circulation is less than the $K_{m}$ of the
renin-angiotensinogen reaction and is therefore an important determinant of the rate of formation of angiotensin.

The production of angiotensinogen is increased by corticosteroids, estrogens, thyroid hormones, and angiotensin II. It is also elevated during pregnancy and in women taking estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. The increased plasma angiotensinogen concentration is thought to contribute to the hypertension that may occur in these situations.

\section*{Angiotensin I}

Although angiotensin I contains the peptide sequences necessary for all of the actions of the reninangiotensin system, it has little or no biologic activity. Instead, it must be converted to angiotensin II by converting enzyme (Figure 17-1). Angiotensin I may also be acted on by plasma or tissue aminopeptidases to form [des-Asp1] angiotensin I; this in turn is converted to [des-Asp1]angiotensin II (commonly known as angiotensin III) by converting enzyme.

\section*{Converting Enzyme (ACE, Peptidyl Dipeptidase, Kininase II)}

Converting enzyme is a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that catalyzes the cleavage of dipeptides from the carboxyl terminal of certain peptides. Its most important substrates are angiotensin I, which it converts to angiotensin II, and bradykinin, which it inactivates (see below). It also cleaves enkephalins and substance P , but the physiologic significance of these effects has not been established. The action of converting enzyme is prevented by a penultimate prolyl residue, and angiotensin II is therefore not hydrolyzed by converting enzyme. Converting enzyme is distributed widely in the body. In most tissues, converting enzyme is located on the luminal surface of vascular endothelial cells and is thus in close contact with the circulation.

A homolog of converting enzyme known as ACE2 was recently discovered. ACE2 is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells of the kidneys, heart, and testes. Unlike converting enzyme, ACE2 has only one active site and functions as a carboxypeptidase rather than a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase. It removes a single amino acid from the C-terminal of angiotensin I and II forming angiotensin (1-9), which has no known function, and angiotensin (1-7), which has vasodilator activity and may serve to counteract the vasoconstrictor activity of angiotensin II. ACE2 also differs from converting enzyme in that it does not hydrolyze bradykinin and is not inhibited by converting enzyme inhibitors (see below). Thus, the enzyme might better be regarded as an angiotensinase rather than a converting enzyme.
(An interesting recent finding is that ACE2 is a functional receptor for coronaviruses including the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome.)

\section*{Angiotensinase}

Angiotensin II, which has a plasma half-life of 15-60 seconds, is removed rapidly from the circulation by a variety of peptidases collectively referred to as angiotensinase. It is metabolized during passage through most vascular beds (a notable exception being the lung). Most metabolites of angiotensin II are biologically inactive, but the initial product of aminopeptidase action-[des-Asp1]angiotensin II-retains considerable biologic activity.

\section*{ACTIONS OF ANGI OTENSI N II}

Angiotensin II exerts important actions at vascular smooth muscle, adrenal cortex, kidney, heart, and brain. Through these actions, the renin-angiotensin system plays a key role in the regulation of fluid
and electrolyte balance and arterial blood pressure. Excessive activity of the renin-angiotensin system can result in hypertension and disorders of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis.

\section*{Blood Pressure}

Angiotensin II is a very potent pressor agent-on a molar basis, approximately 40 times more potent than norepinephrine. The pressor response to intravenous angiotensin II is rapid in onset (10-15 seconds) and sustained during long-term infusions. A large component of the pressor response is due to direct contraction of vascular-especially arteriolar-smooth muscle. In addition, however, angiotensin II can also increase blood pressure through actions on the brain and autonomic nervous system. The pressor response to angiotensin is usually accompanied by little or no reflex bradycardia because the peptide acts on the brain to reset the baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate to a higher pressure.

Angiotensin II also interacts with the autonomic nervous system. It stimulates autonomic ganglia, increases the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla, and-what is most important-facilitates sympathetic transmission by an action at adrenergic nerve terminals. The latter effect involves both increased release and reduced reuptake of norepinephrine. Angiotensin II also has a less important direct positive inotropic action on the heart.

\section*{Adrenal Cortex}

Angiotensin II acts directly on the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex to stimulate aldosterone biosynthesis. At higher concentrations, angiotensin II also stimulates glucocorticoid biosynthesis.

\section*{Kidney}

Angiotensin II acts on the kidney to cause renal vasoconstriction, increase proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, and inhibit the secretion of renin.

\section*{Central Nervous System}

In addition to its central effects on blood pressure, angiotensin II acts on the central nervous system to stimulate drinking (dipsogenic effect) and increase the secretion of vasopressin and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The physiologic significance of the effects of angiotensin II on drinking and pituitary hormone secretion is not known.

\section*{Cell Growth}

Angiotensin II is mitogenic for vascular and cardiac muscle cells and may contribute to the development of cardiovascular hypertrophy. It also exerts a variety of important effects on the vascular endothelium. Considerable evidence now indicates that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (see below) slow or prevent morphologic changes (remodeling) following myocardial infarction that would otherwise lead to heart failure.

\section*{ANGI OTENSI N RECEPTORS \& MECHANI SM OF ACTI ON}

Angiotensin II receptors are widely distributed in the body. Like the receptors for other peptide hormones, angiotensin II receptors are located on the plasma membrane of target cells, and this permits rapid onset of the various actions of angiotensin II.

Two distinct subtypes of angiotensin II receptors, termed $\mathbf{A T}_{\mathbf{1}}$ and $\mathbf{A T}_{\mathbf{2}}$, have been identified on the basis of their differential affinity for antagonists, and their sensitivity to sulfhydryl-reducing agents. AT $_{1}$
receptors have a high affinity for losartan and a low affinity for PD 123177 (an experimental nonpeptide antagonist), whereas AT $_{2}$ receptors have a high affinity for PD 123177 and a low affinity for losartan. Angiotensin II and saralasin (see below) bind equally to both subtypes. The relative proportion of the two subtypes varies from tissue to tissue: AT $_{1}$ receptors predominate in vascular smooth muscle.

Most of the known actions of angiotensin II are mediated by the AT ${ }_{1}$ receptor, a $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{q}}$ protein-coupled receptor. Binding of angiotensin II to AT ${ }_{1}$ receptors in vascular smooth muscle results in activation of phospholipase C and generation of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (see Chapter 2). These events, which occur within seconds, result in smooth muscle contraction.

The stimulation of vascular and cardiac growth by angiotensin II is mediated by other pathways, probably receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as the Janus tyrosine kinase Jak2 and increased transcription of specific genes (see Chapter 2).

The $A T_{2}$ receptor has a structure and affinity for angiotensin II similar to those of the $A T_{1}$ receptor. In contrast, however, stimulation of $\mathrm{AT}_{2}$ receptors causes vasodilation that may serve to counteract the vasoconstriction resulting from $A T_{1}$ receptor stimulation. $A T_{2}$ receptor-mediated vasodilation appears to be nitric oxide (NO)-dependent and may involve the bradykinin $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ receptor-NO-cGMP pathway.

AT $_{2}$ receptors are present at high density in all tissues during fetal development, but they are much less abundant in the adult where they are expressed at high concentration only in the adrenal medulla, reproductive tissues, vascular endothelium, and parts of the brain. $\mathrm{AT}_{2}$ receptors are up-regulated in pathologic conditions including heart failure and myocardial infarction. The functions of the $\mathrm{AT}_{2}$ receptor appear to include fetal tissue development, inhibition of growth and proliferation, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and vasodilation.

\section*{I NHI BITION OF THE RENI N-ANGI OTENSI N SYSTEM}

A wide variety of agents are now available that block the formation or actions of angiotensin II. These drugs block renin secretion, the enzymatic action of renin, the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, or angiotensin II receptors.

\section*{Drugs That Block Renin Secretion}

Several drugs that interfere with the sympathetic nervous system inhibit the secretion of renin. Examples are clonidine and propranolol. Clonidine inhibits renin secretion by causing a centrally mediated reduction in renal sympathetic nerve activity, and it may also exert a direct intrarenal action. Propranolol and other B-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs act by blocking the intrarenal and extrarenal B receptors involved in the neural control of renin secretion.

\section*{Renin Inhibitors}

Drugs that inhibit renin have been available for many years but have been limited by low potency, bioavailability, and duration of action. However, a new class of nonpeptide, low-molecular weight, orally active inhibitors has recently been developed.

Aliskiren is the most advanced of these. In healthy subjects, aliskiren produces a dose-dependent reduction in plasma renin activity and angiotensin I and II and aldosterone concentrations. In patients with essential hypertension, aliskiren suppresses plasma renin activity and causes dose-related
reductions in blood pressure similar to those produced by angiotensin II receptor antagonists (Figure 17-2). The safety and tolerability of aliskiren appear to be comparable to angiotensin antagonists and placebo. Renin inhibition thus has considerable promise for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular and renal diseases.

\section*{Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors}

An important class of orally active ACE inhibitors, directed against the active site of ACE, is now extensively used. Captopril and enalapril (Figure 17-3) are examples of the many potent ACE inhibitors that are available. These drugs differ in their structure and pharmacokinetics, but in clinical use, they are interchangeable. ACE inhibitors decrease systemic vascular resistance without increasing heart rate, and they promote natriuresis. As described in Chapters 11 and 13, they are effective in the treatment of hypertension, decrease morbidity and mortality in heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction, and delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy.

Two orally active converting enzyme inhibitors. Enalapril is a prodrug ethyl ester that is hydrolyzed in the body.
ACE inhibitors not only block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II but also inhibit the degradation of other substances, including bradykinin, substance $P$, and enkephalins. The action of ACE inhibitors to inhibit bradykinin metabolism contributes significantly to their hypotensive action (see Figure 11-5) and is apparently responsible for some adverse side effects, including cough and angioedema.

Recent evidence suggests that some of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors can be attributed to activation of a distinct ACE-signaling cascade in addition to the changes in angiotensin II and bradykinin levels.

\section*{Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists}

Potent peptide antagonists of the action of angiotensin II have been developed. The best-known of these is the partial agonist, saralasin. Saralasin lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients but may elicit pressor responses, particularly when circulating angiotensin II levels are low. Because it must be administered intravenously, saralasin is used only for investigation of renin-dependent hypertension and other hyperreninemic states.

The nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonists are of much greater interest. Losartan (Figure 17-4), valsartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, candesartan, olmesartan, and telmesartan are orally active, potent, and specific competitive antagonists of angiotensin AT1 receptors. The efficacy of these drugs in hypertension is similar to that of ACE inhibitors, but they are associated with a lower incidence of cough. Like ACE inhibitors, nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonists slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy. The antagonists are also effective in the treatment of heart failure and provide a useful alternative when ACE inhibitors are not well tolerated. Like ACE inhibitors, they are well tolerated but
should not be used by patients with nondiabetic renal disease or in pregnancy.

Structure of an angiotensin $\mathrm{AT}_{1}$ receptor antagonist.
The current angiotensin II receptor antagonists are selective for the $\mathrm{AT}_{1}$ receptor. Since prolonged treatment with the drugs disinhibits renin secretion and increases circulating angiotensin II levels, there may be increased stimulation of $\mathrm{AT}_{2}$ receptors. This may be significant in view of the evidence that activation of the $A T_{2}$ receptor causes vasodilation and other beneficial effects. $A T_{2}$ receptor antagonists such as PD 123177 are available for research but have no clinical applications at this time.

The clinical benefits of $\mathrm{AT}_{1}$ receptor antagonists are similar to those of ACE inhibitors, and it is not clear if one group of drugs has significant advantages over the other. Combination therapy with both an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor antagonist has a number of potential advantages and is currently being investigated.

\section*{KININS}

\section*{BI OSYNTHESIS OF KI NI NS}

Kinins are potent vasodilator peptides formed enzymatically by the action of enzymes known as kallikreins or kininogenases acting on protein substrates called kininogens. The kallikrein-kinin system has several features in common with the renin-angiotensin system.

\section*{Kallikreins}

Kallikreins are present in plasma and in several tissues, including the kidneys, pancreas, intestine, sweat glands, and salivary glands. Plasma prekallikrein can be activated to kallikrein by trypsin,

Hageman factor, and possibly kallikrein itself. In general, the biochemical properties of tissue kallikreins are different from those of plasma kallikreins. Kallikreins can convert prorenin to active renin, but the physiologic significance of this action has not been established.

\section*{Kininogens}

Kininogens-the precursors of kinins and substrates of kallikreins-are present in plasma, lymph, and interstitial fluid. Two kininogens are known to be present in plasma: a low-molecular-weight form (LMW kininogen) and a high-molecular-weight form (HMW kininogen). About 15-20\% of the total plasma kininogen is in the HMW form. It is thought that LMW kininogen crosses capillary walls and serves as the substrate for tissue kallikreins, whereas HMW kininogen is confined to the bloodstream and serves as the substrate for plasma kallikrein.

\section*{FORMATION OF KI NI NS IN PLASMA \& TI SSUES}

The pathway for the formation and metabolism of kinins is shown in Figure 17-5. Three kinins have been identified in mammals: bradykinin, lysylbradykinin (also known as kallidin), and methionyllysylbradykinin. Each contains bradykinin in its structure.

Figure 17-5.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-0535.jpg?height=787&width=884&top_left_y=1116&top_left_x=466)

The kallikrein-kinin system. Kininase II is identical to converting enzyme peptidyl dipeptidase.

Each kinin is formed from a kininogen by the action of a different enzyme. Bradykinin is released by plasma kallikrein, lysylbradykinin by tissue kallikrein, and methionyllysylbradykinin by pepsin and pepsin-like enzymes. The three kinins have been found in plasma and urine. Bradykinin is the predominant kinin in plasma, whereas lysylbradykinin is the major urinary form.

\section*{ACTIONS OF KI NI NS}

\section*{Effects on the Cardiovascular System}

Kinins produce marked vasodilation in several vascular beds, including the heart, kidney, intestine, skeletal muscle, and liver. In this respect, kinins are approximately 10 times more potent on a molar basis than histamine. The vasodilation may result from a direct inhibitory effect of kinins on arteriolar smooth muscle or may be mediated by the release of nitric oxide or vasodilator prostaglandins such as $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$. In contrast, the predominant effect of kinins on veins is contraction; again, this may result from direct stimulation of venous smooth muscle or from the release of venoconstrictor prostaglandins such as $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$. Kinins also produce contraction of most visceral smooth muscle.

When injected intravenously, kinins produce a rapid but brief fall in blood pressure that is due to their arteriolar vasodilator action. Intravenous infusions of the peptide fail to produce a sustained decrease in blood pressure; prolonged hypotension can only be produced by progressively increasing the rate of infusion. The rapid reversibility of the hypotensive response to kinins is due primarily to reflex increases in heart rate, myocardial contractility, and cardiac output. In some species, bradykinin produces a biphasic change in blood pressure-an initial hypotensive response followed by an increase above the preinjection level. The increase in blood pressure may be due to a reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system, but under some conditions, bradykinin can directly release catecholamines from the adrenal medulla and stimulate sympathetic ganglia. Bradykinin also increases blood pressure when injected into the central nervous system, but the physiologic significance of this effect is not clear, since it is unlikely that kinins cross the blood-brain barrier. Kinins have no consistent effect on sympathetic or parasympathetic nerve endings.

The arteriolar dilation produced by kinins causes an increase in pressure and flow in the capillary bed, thus favoring efflux of fluid from blood to tissues. This effect may be facilitated by increased capillary permeability resulting from contraction of endothelial cells and widening of intercellular junctions, and by increased venous pressure secondary to constriction of veins. As a result of these changes, water and solutes pass from the blood to the extracellular fluid, lymph flow increases, and edema may result.

\section*{Effects on Endocrine \& Exocrine Glands}

As noted earlier, prekallikreins and kallikreins are present in several glands, including the pancreas, kidney, intestine, salivary glands, and sweat glands, and they can be released into the secretory fluids of these glands. The function of the enzymes in these tissues is not known. The enzymes (or active kinins) may diffuse from the organs to the blood and act as local modulators of blood flow. Since kinins have such marked effects on smooth muscle, they may also modulate the tone of salivary and pancreatic ducts and help regulate gastrointestinal motility. Kinins also influence the transepithelial transport of water, electrolytes, glucose, and amino acids, and may regulate the transport of these substances in the gastrointestinal tract and kidney. Finally, kallikreins may play a role in the physiologic activation of various prohormones, including proinsulin and prorenin.

\section*{Role in Inflammation}

Kinins play an important role in the inflammatory process. Kallikreins and kinins can produce redness, local heat, swelling, and pain, and the production of kinins is increased in inflammatory lesions produced by a variety of methods.

\section*{Effects on Sensory Nerves}

Kinins are potent pain-producing substances when applied to a blister base or injected intradermally. They elicit pain by stimulating nociceptive afferents in the skin and viscera.

\section*{KI NI N RECEPTORS \& MECHANI SMS OF ACTION}

The biologic actions of kinins are mediated by specific receptors located on the membranes of the target tissues. Two types of kinin receptors, termed $\mathrm{B}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{B}_{2}$, have been defined based on the rank orders of agonist potencies. (Note that $B$ here stands for bradykinin, not for $B$-adrenoceptor.) Bradykinin displays the highest affinity in most $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ receptor systems, followed by Lys-bradykinin and then by Met-Lys-bradykinin. One exception is the $B_{2}$ receptor that mediates contraction of venous smooth muscle; this appears to be most sensitive to Lys-bradykinin. Recent evidence suggests the existence of two $B_{2}$-receptor subtypes, which have been termed $B_{2 A}$ and $B_{2 B}$.
$B_{1}$ receptors appear to have a very limited distribution in mammalian tissues and have few known functional roles. Studies with knockout mice that lack functional $\mathrm{B}_{1}$ receptors suggest that these receptors participate in the inflammatory response and may also be important in long-lasting kinin effects such as collagen synthesis and cell multiplication. By contrast, $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ receptors have a widespread distribution that is consistent with the multitude of biologic effects that are mediated by this receptor type. $B_{2}$ receptors are $G$ protein-coupled and agonist binding sets in motion multiple signal transduction events, including calcium mobilization, chloride transport, formation of nitric oxide, and activation of phospholipase C, phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}$, and adenylyl cyclase.

\section*{METABOLI SM OF KI NI NS}

Kinins are metabolized rapidly (half-life < 15 seconds) by nonspecific exopeptidases or endopeptidases, commonly referred to as kininases. Two plasma kininases have been well characterized. Kininase I, apparently synthesized in the liver, is a carboxypeptidase that releases the carboxyl terminal arginine residue. Kininase II is present in plasma and vascular endothelial cells throughout the body. It is identical to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, peptidyl dipeptidase), discussed above. Kininase II inactivates kinins by cleaving the carboxyl terminal dipeptide phenylalanyl-arginine. Like angiotensin I, bradykinin is almost completely hydrolyzed during a single passage through the pulmonary vascular bed.

\section*{DRUGS AFFECTI NG THE KALLI KREI N-KI NI N SYSTEM}

Drugs that modify the activity of the kallikrein-kinin system are available, though none are in wide clinical use. Considerable effort has been directed toward developing kinin receptor antagonists, since such drugs have considerable therapeutic potential as anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive agents. Competitive antagonists of both $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ receptors are available for research use. Examples of $B_{1}$ receptor antagonists are the peptides [Leu ${ }^{8}$-des-Arg ${ }^{9}$ ]bradykinin and Lys[Leu ${ }^{8}$-des Arg ${ }^{9}$ ]bradykinin. Nonpeptide $\mathrm{B}_{1}$ receptor antagonists are not yet available. The first $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ receptor antagonists to be discovered were also peptide derivatives of bradykinin. These first-generation antagonists were used extensively in animal studies of kinin receptor pharmacology. However, their half-life is short, and they are almost inactive on the human $B_{2}$ receptor.

I catibant is a second-generation $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ receptor antagonist. It is orally active, potent, and selective, has a long duration of action ( $>60$ minutes), and displays high $B_{2}$-receptor affinity in humans and all other species in which it has been tested. Icatibant has been used extensively in animal studies to block
exogenous and endogenous bradykinin and in human studies to evaluate the role of kinins in pain, hyperalgesia, and inflammation.

Recently, a third generation of $\mathrm{B}_{2}$-receptor antagonists was developed; examples are FR 173657, FR 172357, and NPC 18884. These antagonists block both human and animal $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ receptors and are orally active. They have been reported to inhibit bradykinin-induced bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs, carrageenin-induced inflammatory responses in rats, and capsaicin-induced nociception in mice. These antagonists have promise for the treatment of inflammatory pain in humans.

SSR240612 is a new, potent, and orally active selective antagonist of $\mathrm{B}_{1}$ receptors in humans and several animal species. It exhibits analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities in mice and rats and is currently in preclinical development for the treatment of inflammatory and neurogenic pain.

The synthesis of kinins can be inhibited with the kallikrein inhibitor aprotinin. Actions of kinins mediated by prostaglandin generation can be blocked nonspecifically with inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis such as aspirin. Conversely, the actions of kinins can be enhanced with ACE inhibitors, which block the degradation of the peptides. Indeed, as noted above, inhibition of bradykinin metabolism by ACE inhibitors contributes significantly to their antihypertensive action.

There is evidence that by acting on $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ receptors, bradykinin may play a beneficial, protective role in cardiovascular disease. Selective $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ agonists are available and have been shown to be effective in some animal models of human cardiovascular disease. These drugs may have potential for the treatment of hypertension and myocardial hypertrophy.

\section*{VASOPRESSI N}

Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) plays an important role in the long-term control of blood pressure through its action on the kidney to increase water reabsorption. This and other aspects of the physiology of vasopressin are discussed in Chapters 15 and 37 and will not be reviewed here.

Vasopressin also plays an important role in the short-term regulation of arterial pressure by its vasoconstrictor action. It increases total peripheral resistance when infused in doses less than those required to produce maximum urine concentration. Such doses do not normally increase arterial pressure because the vasopressor activity of the peptide is buffered by a reflex decrease in cardiac output. When the influence of this reflex is removed, eg, in shock, pressor sensitivity to vasopressin is greatly increased. Pressor sensitivity to vasopressin is also enhanced in patients with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension. Higher doses of vasopressin increase blood pressure even when baroreceptor reflexes are intact.

\section*{VASOPRESSI N RECEPTORS \& ANTAGONISTS}

Three subtypes of vasopressin receptors have been identified. $\mathbf{V}_{\mathbf{1 a}}$ receptors mediate the vasoconstrictor action of vasopressin; $\mathbf{V}_{\mathbf{1 b}}$ receptors potentiate the release of ACTH by pituitary corticotropes; and $\mathbf{V}_{\mathbf{2}}$ receptors mediate the antidiuretic action. $\mathrm{V}_{1 a}$ effects are mediated by activation of phospholipase C , formation of inositol trisphosphate, and increased intracellular calcium concentration. $V_{2}$ effects are mediated by activation of adenylyl cyclase.

Vasopressin-like peptides selective for either vasoconstrictor or antidiuretic activity have been synthesized. The most specific $V_{1}$ vasoconstrictor agonist synthesized to date is [Phe ${ }^{2}, \mathrm{Ile}^{3}$,

Orn ${ }^{8}$ ]vasotocin. Selective $\mathrm{V}_{2}$ antidiuretic analogs include 1-deamino[D-Arg ${ }^{8}$ ]arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) and 1-deamino[Val ${ }^{4}$,D-Arg ${ }^{8}$ ]arginine vasopressin (dVDAVP).

Specific antagonists of the vasoconstrictor action of vasopressin are also available. The peptide antagonist [1-(B-mercapto-B,B-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid)-2-(O-methyl)tyrosine] arginine vasopressin also has antioxytocic activity but does not antagonize the antidiuretic action of vasopressin. Recently, nonpeptide, orally active $\mathrm{V}_{1 \mathrm{a}}$ receptor antagonists have been discovered, examples being OPC-21268 and SR49059.

The vasopressor antagonists of vasopressin have been particularly useful in revealing the important role that vasopressin plays in blood pressure regulation in situations such as dehydration and hemorrhage. They have potential for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. To date, most studies have focused on heart failure in which promising results have been obtained with $\mathrm{V}_{2}$ antagonists. However, $\mathrm{V}_{1 \mathrm{a}}$ antagonists also have potential, and conivaptan (YM087), a drug with both $\mathrm{V}_{1 \mathrm{a}}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{2}$ antagonist effects, has been approved for treatment of hyponatremia (see Chapter 15).

\section*{NATRI URETI C PEPTI DES}

\section*{Synthesis \& Structure}

The atria and other tissues of mammals contain a family of peptides with natriuretic, diuretic, vasorelaxant, and other properties. The family consists of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). The structures of the three peptides are similar (Figure 17-6), but there are differences in their biologic effects. ANP is derived from the carboxyl terminal end of a common precursor termed preproANP. ANP is synthesized primarily in cardiac atrial cells, but small amounts are synthesized in ventricular cells. It is also synthesized by neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems and in the lungs. ANP circulates as a 28-aminoacid peptide with a single disulfide bridge that forms a 17-residue ring.

Figure 17-6.

Structures of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). Sequences common to the peptides are indicated in blue.

Several factors increase the release of ANP from the heart, but the most important one appears to be atrial stretch via mechanosensitive ion channels. ANP release is also increased by volume expansion, head-out water immersion, changing from the standing to the supine position, and exercise. ANP release can also be increased by sympathetic stimulation via $Q_{1} A^{-}$adrenoceptors, endothelins (see below) via the $\mathrm{ET}_{\mathrm{A}}$-receptor subtype, glucocorticoids, and vasopressin. Finally, plasma ANP concentration increases in various pathologic states, including heart failure, primary aldosteronism, chronic renal failure, and inappropriate ADH secretion syndrome.

Administration of ANP produces prompt and marked increases in sodium excretion and urine flow. Glomerular filtration rate increases, with little or no change in renal blood flow, so that the filtration fraction increases. The ANP-induced natriuresis is apparently due to both the increase in glomerular filtration rate and a decrease in proximal tubular sodium reabsorption. ANP also inhibits the secretion of renin, aldosterone, and vasopressin; these changes may also increase sodium and water excretion.

Finally, ANP decreases arterial blood pressure. This hypotensive action is due to vasodilation, which results from stimulated particulate guanylyl cyclase activity, increased cGMP levels, and decreased cytosolic free calcium concentration. ANP also reduces sympathetic tone to the peripheral vasculature and antagonizes the vasoconstrictor action of angiotensin II and other vasoconstrictors. These actions may contribute to the hypotensive action of the peptide.

There is considerable evidence that ANP participates in the physiologic regulation of sodium excretion and blood pressure. For example, suppression of ANP production or blockade of its action impairs the natriuretic response to volume expansion, and increases blood pressure.

BNP was originally isolated from porcine brain but, like ANP, it is synthesized primarily in the heart. It exists in two forms, having either 26 or 32 amino acids (Figure 17-6). Like ANP, the release of BNP appears to be volume-related; indeed, the two peptides may be co-secreted. BNP exhibits natriuretic, diuretic, and hypotensive activities similar to those of ANP but circulates at a lower concentration.

CNP consists of 22 amino acids (Figure 17-6). It is located predominantly in the central nervous system but is also present in several other tissues including the vascular endothelium, kidneys, and intestine. It has not been found in significant concentrations in the circulation. CNP has less natriuretic and diuretic activity than ANP and BNP but is a potent vasodilator. Its physiologic role is unclear.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics \& Pharmacokinetics}

The biologic actions of the natriuretic peptides are mediated through association with specific highaffinity receptors located on the surface of the target cells. Three receptor subtypes termed $\mathbf{A N} \mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{A}}$, $\mathbf{A N} \mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{B}}$, and $\mathbf{A N} \mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{C}}$ have been identified. The $\mathbf{A N P}_{\mathbf{A}}$ receptor consists of a 120 kDa protein; its primary ligands are ANP and BNP . The $\mathrm{ANP}_{\mathrm{B}}$ receptor is similar in structure to the $\mathrm{ANP}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor, but its primary ligand appears to be $C N P$. The $A N P_{A}$ and $A N P_{B}$ receptors, but not the $A N P_{C}$ receptor, are coupled to guanylyl cyclase.

The natriuretic peptides have a short half-life in the circulation. They are metabolized in the kidneys, liver, and lungs by the neutral endopeptidase NEP 24.11. Inhibition of this endopeptidase results in increases in circulating levels of the natriuretic peptides, natriuresis, and diuresis. The peptides are also removed from the circulation by binding to $\mathrm{ANP}_{\mathrm{C}}$ receptors in the vascular endothelium. This receptor binds the three natriuretic peptides with equal affinity. The receptor and bound peptide are internalized, the peptide is degraded enzymatically, and the receptor is returned to the cell surface.

Administration of BNP as nesiritide (see Chapter 13) in patients with severe heart failure increases sodium excretion and improves hemodynamics. However, the peptide has to be given by constant intravenous infusion and has caused fatal renal damage. A more promising approach may be the use of drugs that inhibit the neutral endopeptidase responsible for the breakdown of ANP. This is discussed below under Vasopeptidase Inhibitors. Patients with heart failure have high plasma levels of ANP and BNP; the latter has emerged as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in this condition.

\section*{VASOPEPTIDASE I NHIBITORS}

Vasopeptidase inhibitors are a new class of cardiovascular drugs that inhibit two metalloprotease enzymes, NEP 24.11 and ACE. They thus simultaneously increase the levels of natriuretic peptides and decrease the formation of angiotensin II. As a result, they enhance vasodilation, reduce vasoconstriction, and increase sodium excretion, in turn reducing peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure.

Recently developed vasopeptidase inhibitors include omapatrilat, sampatrilat, and fasidotrilat. Omapatrilat, which has received the most attention, lowers blood pressure in animal models of hypertension as well as in hypertensive patients, and improves cardiac function in patients with heart failure. Unfortunately, omapatrilat causes a significant incidence of angioedema in addition to cough and dizziness and has not been approved for clinical use.

\section*{ENDOTHELI NS}

The endothelium is the source of a variety of substances with vasodilator ( $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ and nitric oxide) and vasoconstrictor activities. The latter include the endothelin family, potent vasoconstrictor peptides that were first isolated from aortic endothelial cells.

\section*{Biosynthesis, Structure, \& Clearance}

Three isoforms of endothelin have been identified: the originally described endothelin (ET-1) and two similar peptides, ET-2 and ET-3. Each isoform is a product of a different gene and is synthesized as a prepro form that is processed to a propeptide and then to the mature peptide. Processing to the mature peptides occurs through the action of endothelin-converting enzyme. Each endothelin is a 21-amino-acid peptide containing two disulfide bridges (Figure 17-7).

Figure 17-7.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-0543.jpg?height=878&width=882&top_left_y=188&top_left_x=609)

Structures of the endothelin peptides endothelin-1, endothelin-2, and endothelin-3. Sequences different in the three peptides are shown in blue.

Endothelins are widely distributed in the body. ET-1 is the predominant endothelin secreted by the vascular endothelium. It is also produced by neurons and astrocytes in the central nervous system and in endometrial, renal mesangial, Sertoli, breast epithelial, and other cells. ET-2 is produced predominantly in the kidneys and intestine, whereas ET-3 is found in highest concentration in the brain but is also present in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and kidneys. Endothelins are present in the blood but in low concentration; they apparently act locally in a paracrine or autocrine fashion rather than as circulating hormones.

The expression of the ET-1 gene is increased by growth factors and cytokines, including transforming growth factor- $B$ (TGF- $B$ ) and interleukin 1 (IL-1), vasoactive substances including angiotensin II and vasopressin, and mechanical stress. Expression is inhibited by nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and atrial natriuretic peptide.

Clearance of endothelins from the circulation is rapid and involves both enzymatic degradation by NEP 24.11 and clearance by the $\mathrm{ET}_{\mathrm{B}}$ receptor.

\section*{Actions}

Endothelins exert widespread actions in the body. In particular, they cause dose-dependent vasoconstriction in most vascular beds. Intravenous administration of ET-1 causes a rapid and transient decrease in arterial blood pressure followed by a prolonged increase. The depressor response results from release of prostacyclin and nitric oxide from the vascular endothelium, whereas the pressor response is due to direct contraction of vascular smooth muscle. Endothelins also exert direct positive inotropic and chronotropic actions on the heart and are potent coronary vasoconstrictors. They
act on the kidneys to cause vasoconstriction and decrease glomerular filtration rate and sodium and water excretion. In the respiratory system, they cause potent contraction of tracheal and bronchial smooth muscle. Endothelins interact with several endocrine systems, increasing the secretion of renin, aldosterone, vasopressin, and atrial natriuretic peptide. They exert a variety of actions on the central and peripheral nervous systems, the gastrointestinal system, the liver, the urinary tract, the male and female reproductive systems, the eye, the skeletal system, and the skin. Finally, ET-1 is a potent mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiac myocytes, and glomerular mesangial cells.

Endothelin receptors are widespread in the body. Two endothelin receptor subtypes, termed $\mathbf{E T}_{\mathbf{A}}$ and $\mathbf{E T}_{\mathbf{B}}$, have been cloned and sequenced. $\mathrm{ET}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptors have a high affinity for $\mathrm{ET}-1$ and a low affinity for ET-3 and are located on smooth muscle cells, where they mediate vasoconstriction. $\mathrm{ET}_{\mathrm{B}}$ receptors have approximately equal affinities for ET-1 and ET-3 and are located on vascular endothelial cells, where they mediate release of $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ and nitric oxide. Both receptor subtypes belong to the G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane domain family of receptors.

The signal transduction mechanisms triggered by binding of ET-1 to its receptors include stimulation of phospholipase C, formation of inositol trisphosphate, and release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, which results in vasoconstriction. Stimulation of $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ and nitric oxide synthesis results in decreased intracellular calcium concentration and vasodilation.

\section*{I NHI BITORS OF ENDOTHELI N SYNTHESIS \& ACTION}

The endothelin system can be blocked with receptor antagonists and drugs that block endothelinconverting enzyme. Endothelin $\mathrm{ET}_{\mathrm{A}}$ or $\mathrm{ET}_{\mathrm{B}}$ receptors can be blocked selectively, or both can be blocked with nonselective $E T_{A}-E T_{B}$ antagonists.

Bosentanis a nonselective antagonist. This drug is active intravenously and orally, and blocks both the initial transient depressor ( $E T_{B}$ ) and the prolonged pressor ( $E T_{A}$ ) responses to intravenous endothelin. Many orally active endothelin receptor antagonists with increased selectivity have been developed and are available for research use.

Bosentan

The formation of endothelins can be blocked by inhibiting endothelin-converting enzyme with phosphoramidon. Phosphoramidon is not specific for endothelin-converting enzyme, but several potent and more selective inhibitors are now available. The therapeutic potential of these drugs may be
similar to that of the endothelin receptor antagonists (see below).

\section*{PHYSIOLOGIC \& PATHOLOGI C ROLES OF ENDOTHELI N: EFFECTS OF ENDOTHELI N ANTAGONI STS}

Systemic administration of endothelin receptor antagonists or endothelin-converting enzyme inhibitors causes vasodilation and decreases arterial pressure in humans and experimental animals. Intra-arterial administration of the drugs also causes slow-onset forearm vasodilation in humans. These observations provide evidence that the endothelin system participates in the regulation of vascular tone, even under resting conditions.

There is increasing evidence that endothelins participate in a variety of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction. Endothelins have also been implicated in pulmonary diseases, including asthma and pulmonary hypertension, as well as in several renal diseases.

Endothelin antagonists have considerable potential in the treatment of these diseases. In clinical trials, bosentan and other nonselective antagonists as well as $\mathrm{ET}_{\mathrm{A}}$-selective antagonists (sitaxentan, ambrisentan) have produced beneficial effects on hemodynamics and other symptoms in heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and essential hypertension. Bosentan is currently approved for use in pulmonary hypertension (see Chapter 11), and a related antagonist, tezosentan, is under investigation for the treatment of acute heart failure.

Endothelin antagonists occasionally cause systemic hypotension, increased heart rate, facial flushing or edema, and headaches. Potential gastrointestinal effects include nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Because of their teratogenic effects, ET antagonists are contraindicated in pregnancy. Bosentan has been associated with fatal hepatotoxicity, and patients taking this drug must have monthly liver function tests. Negative pregnancy test results are required for women of child-bearing age to take this drug.

\section*{VASOACTI VE I NTESTI NAL PEPTI DE}

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a 28-amino-acid peptide related structurally to secretin and glucagon. VIP is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems, where it functions as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator. It is also present in the gastrointestinal tract, heart, lungs, kidneys, and thyroid gland. Many blood vessels are innervated by VIP neurons. VIP is found in blood but does not appear to function as a hormone.

VIP exerts significant effects on the cardiovascular system. It produces marked vasodilation in most vascular beds and in this regard is more potent on a molar basis than acetylcholine. In the heart, VIP causes coronary vasodilation and exerts positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. It may thus participate in the regulation of coronary blood flow, cardiac contraction, and heart rate.

The effects of VIP are mediated by G protein-coupled receptors; two subtypes, VPAC1 and VPAC2, have been cloned from human tissues. Both subtypes are widely distributed in the central nervous system and in the heart, blood vessels, and other tissues. Binding of VIP to its receptors results in activation of adenylyl cyclase and formation of cAMP, which is responsible for the vasodilation and many other effects of the peptide. Other actions may be mediated by nitric oxide and cGMP.

Specific VIP receptor agonists and antagonists are currently available for research use.

\section*{SUBSTANCE P}

Substance P belongs to the tachykinin family of peptides, which share the common carboxyl terminal sequence Phe-X-Gly-Leu-Met. Other members of this family are neurokinin A and neurokinin B. Substance $P$ is an undecapeptide, while neurokinins $A$ and $B$ are decapeptides.

Substance P is present in the central nervous system, where it is a neurotransmitter (see Chapter 21), and in the gastrointestinal tract, where it may play a role as a transmitter in the enteric nervous system and as a local hormone (see Chapter 6).

Substance P exerts a variety of incompletely understood central actions that implicate the peptide in behavior, anxiety, depression, nausea, and emesis. It is a potent arteriolar vasodilator, producing marked hypotension in humans and several animal species. The vasodilation is mediated by release of nitric oxide from the endothelium. Conversely, substance $P$ causes contraction of venous, intestinal, and bronchial smooth muscle. It also stimulates secretion by the salivary glands and causes diuresis and natriuresis by the kidneys.

The actions of substance $P$ and neurokinins $A$ and $B$ are mediated by three $G$ protein-coupled tachykinin receptors designated $\mathbf{N K}_{\mathbf{1}}, \mathbf{N K}_{\mathbf{2}}$, and $\mathbf{N K}_{\mathbf{3}}$. Substance P is the preferred ligand for the $\mathrm{NK}_{1}$ receptor, the predominant tachykinin receptor in the human brain. However, neurokinins A and B also possess considerable affinity for this receptor. In humans, most of the central and peripheral effects of substance $P$ are mediated by $N_{1}$ receptors.

Several nonpeptide $\mathrm{NK}_{1}$ receptor antagonists have been developed. These compounds are highly selective and orally active, and enter the brain. Recent clinical trials have shown that these antagonists may be useful in treating depression and other disorders and in preventing chemotherapy-induced emesis. The first of these to be approved for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is aprepitant (Chapter 63).

\section*{NEUROTENSIN}

Neurotensin is a tridecapeptide that was first isolated from the central nervous system but subsequently was found to be present in the gastrointestinal tract and in the circulation. It is synthesized as part of a larger precursor that also contains neuromedin $\mathbf{N}$, a six-amino-acid neurotensin-like peptide.

In the brain, processing of the precursor leads primarily to the formation of neurotensin and neuromedin N ; these are released together from nerve endings. In the gut, processing leads mainly to the formation of neurotensin and a larger peptide that contains the neuromedin N sequence at the carboxyl terminal. Both peptides are secreted into the circulation after ingestion of food.

Like many other neuropeptides, neurotensin serves a dual function as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in the central nervous system and as a local hormone in the periphery. When administered centrally, neurotensin exerts potent effects including hypothermia, antinociception, and modulation of dopamine neurotransmission. When administered into the peripheral circulation, it causes vasodilation, hypotension, increased vascular permeability, increased secretion of several
anterior pituitary hormones, hyperglycemia, inhibition of gastric acid and pepsin secretion, and inhibition of gastric motility.

In the central nervous system, there are close associations between neurotensin and dopamine systems, and neurotensin may be involved in clinical disorders involving dopamine pathways such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and drug abuse. Consistent with this, it has been shown that central administration of neurotensin produces effects in rodents similar to those produced by antipsychotic drugs.

Three subtypes of neurotensin receptors, designated $\mathbf{N T}_{\mathbf{1}}, \mathbf{N T}_{\mathbf{2}}$, and $\mathbf{N T}_{\mathbf{3}}$, have been cloned. $\mathbf{N T}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{NT}_{2}$ receptors belong to the G protein-coupled superfamily with seven transmembrane domains; the $\mathrm{NT}_{3}$ receptor is a single transmembrane domain protein that belongs to a family of sorting proteins.

Neurotensin agonists that cross the blood-brain barrier have been developed and may have potential as therapeutic agents for diseases such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.

Neurotensin receptors can be blocked with the nonpeptide antagonists SR142948A and SR48692. SR142948A is a potent antagonist of the hypothermia and analgesia produced by centrally administered neurotensin. It also blocks the cardiovascular effects of systemic neurotensin.

\section*{CALCITONI N GENE- RELATED PEPTI DE}

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a member of the calcitonin family of peptides, which also includes calcitonin, adrenomedullin and amylin. CGRP consists of 37 amino acids and displays approximately $30 \%$ structural homology with salmon calcitonin.

Like calcitonin, CGRP is present in large quantities in the C cells of the thyroid gland. It is also distributed widely in the central and peripheral nervous systems, in the cardiovascular system, the gastrointestinal tract, and the urogenital system. CGRP is found with substance $P$ (see above) in some of these regions and with acetylcholine in others.

When CGRP is injected into the central nervous system, it produces a variety of effects, including hypertension and suppression of feeding. When injected into the systemic circulation, the peptide causes hypotension and tachycardia. The hypotensive action of CGRP results from the potent vasodilator action of the peptide; indeed, CGRP is the most potent vasodilator yet discovered. It dilates multiple vascular beds, but the coronary circulation is particularly sensitive.

The actions of CGRP are mediated by two receptors named CGRP ${ }_{1}$ and CGRP ${ }_{2}$. Peptide and nonpeptide antagonists of these receptors have been developed. Of the nonpeptide antagonists now available, the best characterized is BIBN4096BS, which has a high affinity and specificity for the human CGRP receptor.

Evidence is accumulating that release of CGRP from trigeminal nerves plays a central role in the pathophysiology of migraine. The peptide is released during migraine attacks, and successful treatment of migraine with a selective serotonin agonist normalizes cranial CGRP levels. BIBN4096BS has recently been shown to be an effective, well-tolerated treatment for migraine.

\section*{ADRENOMEDULLI N}

Adrenomedullin was first discovered in human adrenal medullary pheochromocytoma tissue. It is a 52amino acid peptide with a six-amino acid ring and a C-terminal amidation sequence. Like CGRP, adrenomedullin is a member of the calcitonin family of peptides.

Adrenomedullin is widely distributed in the body. The highest concentrations are found in the adrenal glands, hypothalamus, and anterior pituitary, but high levels are also present in the kidneys, lungs, cardiovascular system, and gastrointestinal tract. Adrenomedullin in plasma apparently originates in the heart and vasculature.

In animals, adrenomedullin dilates resistance vessels in the kidney, brain, lung, hind limbs, and mesentery, resulting in a marked, long-lasting hypotension. The hypotension in turn causes reflex increases in heart rate and cardiac output. These responses also occur during intravenous infusion of the peptide in healthy human subjects. Adrenomedullin also acts on the kidneys to increase sodium excretion, and it exerts several endocrine effects including inhibition of aldosterone and insulin secretion. Finally, it acts on the central nervous system to increase sympathetic outflow.

The diverse actions of adrenomedullin are mediated both by CGRP receptors and by specific adrenomedullin receptors termed $A M_{1}$ and $A M_{2}$. The major second messenger for both receptors is cAMP.

Circulating adrenomedullin levels increase during intense exercise. They also increase in a number of pathologic states, including essential hypertension, cardiac and renal failure, and septic shock. The roles of adrenomedullin in these states remain to be defined, but it is currently thought that the peptide functions as a physiologic antagonist of the actions of vasoconstrictors including endothelin 1 and angiotensin II. By virtue of these actions, adrenomedullin may protect against cardiovascular overload and injury.

\section*{NEUROPEPTIDE Y}

Neuropeptide $Y$ is a member of the family that also includes peptide $Y$ and pancreatic polypeptide. Each peptide consists of 36 amino acids.

Neuropeptide $Y$ is one of the most abundant neuropeptides in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the sympathetic nervous system, neuropeptide $Y$ is frequently localized in noradrenergic neurons and apparently functions both as a vasoconstrictor and as a cotransmitter with norepinephrine. Peptide YY and pancreatic polypeptide are both gut endocrine peptides.

Neuropeptide $Y$ produces a variety of central nervous system effects, including increased feeding (it is one of the most potent orexigenic molecules in the brain), hypotension, hypothermia, and respiratory depression. Other effects include vasoconstriction of cerebral blood vessels, positive chronotropic and inotropic actions on the heart, and hypertension. The peptide is a potent renal vasoconstrictor and suppresses renin secretion, but can cause diuresis and natriuresis. Prejunctional neuronal actions include inhibition of transmitter release from sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. Vascular actions include direct vasoconstriction, potentiation of the action of vasoconstrictors, and inhibition of the action of vasodilators.

These diverse effects are mediated by multiple receptors designated $\mathbf{Y}_{1}$ through $\mathbf{Y}_{6}$. All receptors except $Y_{3}$ have been cloned and shown to be $G$ protein-coupled receptors linked to mobilization of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ receptors are of major importance in the cardiovascular and other peripheral effects of the peptide. $Y_{4}$ receptors have a high affinity for pancreatic polypeptide and may be a receptor for the pancreatic peptide rather than for neuropeptide $Y . Y_{5}$ receptors are found mainly in the central nervous system and may be involved in the control of food intake. $\mathrm{Y}_{6}$ receptors do not appear to contribute significantly to the physiologic effects of neuropeptide $Y$ in humans.

Selective nonpeptide neuropeptide $Y$ receptor antagonists are now available for research. The first nonpeptide $\mathrm{Y}_{1}$ receptor antagonist, BIBP3226, is also the most thoroughly studied. It has a short halflife in vivo. In animal models, it blocks the vasoconstrictor and pressor responses to neuropeptide $Y$. Structurally related $\mathrm{Y}_{1}$ antagonists include BIB03304, and H409/22, which has been tested in humans. SR120107A and SR120819A are orally active $Y_{1}$ antagonists and have a long duration of action. BIIE0246 is the first nonpeptide antagonist selective for the $Y_{2}$ receptor.

These antagonists have been useful in analyzing the role of neuropeptide $Y$ in cardiovascular regulation. It now appears that the peptide is not important in the regulation of hemodynamics under normal resting conditions, but may be of increased importance in cardiovascular disorders including hypertension and heart failure. Other studies have implicated neuropeptide $Y$ in feeding disorders, seizures, anxiety, and diabetes, and $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{5}$ receptor antagonists have potential as anti-obesity agents.

\section*{UROTENSIN}

Urotensin II was originally identified in fish, but isoforms are now known to be present in mammalian species including the human, mouse, rat and pig. Human urotensin II is an 11-amino acid peptide. Major sites of urotensin II expression in humans include the brain, spinal cord, and kidneys. Urotensin II is also present in plasma, and the kidneys may be a major source of this circulating peptide.

In vitro, urotensin II is a potent constrictor of vascular smooth muscle; its activity depends on the type of blood vessel and the species from which it was obtained. Vasoconstriction occurs primarily in arterial vessels, where urotensin II can be more potent than endothelin 1, making it the most potent known vasoconstrictor. However, under some conditions, urotensin II may cause vasodilation. In vivo, urotensin II has complex hemodynamic effects, the most prominent being regional vasoconstriction and cardiac depression. In some ways, these effects resemble those produced by endothelin 1. Nevertheless, the extent to which the peptide is involved in the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure in humans is not clear; recent studies have produced conflicting results.

The actions of urotensin II are mediated by a G protein-coupled receptor referred to as the UT receptor. UT receptors are widely distributed in the brain, spinal cord, heart, vascular smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. Some effects of the peptide including vasoconstriction are mediated by the phospholipase C, IP3-DAG signal transduction pathway.

Modifications of the disulfide bridge of urotensin II have yielded UT-receptor antagonists. A nonpeptide antagonist, palosuran, has also been developed.

Evidence is accumulating that urotensin II is involved in cardiovascular and other diseases. In particular, it has been reported that plasma urotensin II levels are increased in hypertension, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and renal failure. UT-receptor antagonists will be valuable in studies of the pathophysiologic role of this peptide.

The eicosanoids are oxygenation products of polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids. They are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom and are also found-together with their precursors-in a variety of plants. They constitute a very large family of compounds that are highly potent and display an extraordinarily wide
spectrum of biologic activity. Because of their biologic activity, the eicosanoids, their specific receptor antagonists and enzyme inhibitors, and their plant and fish oil precursors have great therapeutic potential. Their short half-lives, which are seconds to minutes, make special delivery systems or synthesis of stable analogs mandatory for their clinical use.

\section*{ARACHI DONIC ACID \& OTHER POLYUNSATURATED PRECURSORS}

Arachidonic acid, the most abundant and important of the eicosanoid precursors, is a 20-carbon (C20) fatty acid that contains four double bonds beginning at the omega-6 position to yield a 5,8,11,14eicosatetraenoic acid (designated C20:4-6). For eicosanoid synthesis to occur, arachidonate must first be released or mobilized from membrane phospholipids by one or more lipases of the phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ (PLA $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ ) type (Figure 18-1). At least three phospholipases mediate arachidonate release from membrane lipids: cytosolic (c) $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$, secretory (s) $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$, and calcium-independent (i) $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$. In addition, arachidonate is also released by a combination of phospholipase C and diglyceride lipase.
Figure 18-1.

Pathways of arachidonic acid (AA) release and metabolism.
}

Following mobilization, arachidonic acid is oxygenated by four separate routes: the cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase, P450 epoxygenase, and isoprostane pathways (Figure 18-1). A number of factors determine the type of eicosanoid synthesized: (1) the species, (2) the type of cell, and (3) the cell's particular phenotype. The pattern of eicosanoids synthesized also frequently reflects (4) the manner in which the cell is stimulated. Finally, an important factor governing the pattern of eicosanoid release is (5) the nature of the precursor polyunsaturated fatty acid that has been esterified in specific membrane phospholipids. For example, homo- $\gamma^{\prime}$-linoleic acid (C20:3-6), which is trienoic, yields products that differ from those derived from arachidonate (C20:4-6), which has four double bonds. Similarly, the products derived from eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5-3), which has five double bonds, are also quantitatively different. This is the basis for using as nutritional supplements in humans the structurally different fatty acids obtained from cold water fish or from plants. An example of the significance of the polyunsaturated fatty acid precursors is evident when one considers thromboxane A (TXA) derived from the COX pathway. TXA $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ is synthesized from arachidonate, a tetraenoic acid, and is a powerful vasoconstrictor and aggregator of platelets. However $5,8,11,14,17$-eicosapentaenoic acid yields $\mathrm{TXA}_{3}$, which is relatively inactive. In theory, dietary eicosapentaenoate substitution for arachidonate should minimize thrombotic events due to the displacement of tetraenoic arachidonate in the membrane by a pentaenoic acid.

\section*{SYNTHESIS OF EI COSANOI DS}

\section*{Products of Prostaglandin Endoperoxide Synthases (Cyclooxygenases)}

Two unique COX isozymes convert arachidonic acid into prostaglandin endoperoxide. PGH synthase-1 (COX-1) is expressed constitutively in most cells. In contrast, PGH synthase-2 (COX-2) is inducible; its expression varies markedly depending on the stimulus. COX-2 is an immediate early-response gene product that is markedly up-regulated by shear stress, growth factors, tumor promoters, and cytokines. COX-1 generates prostanoids for "housekeeping" such as gastric epithelial cytoprotection, whereas COX-2 is the major source of prostanoids in inflammation and cancer. This distinction is overly simplistic, however; there are both physiologic and pathophysiologic processes in which each enzyme is uniquely involved and others in which they function coordinately. For example, endothelial COX-2 is the primary source of vascular prostacyclin, whereas renal COX-2-derived prostanoids are important for normal renal development and maintenance of function. An additional COX-1 variant termed "COX-3" has been described in dogs, but it does not appear functionally relevant in other species.

The synthases are important because it is at this step that the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exert their therapeutic effects (see Chapter 36). Indomethacin and sulindac are slightly selective for COX-1. Meclofenamate and ibuprofen are approximately equipotent on COX-1 and COX-2, whereas celecoxib, diclofenac, rofecoxib, lumiracoxib, and etoricoxib inhibit COX-2 with increasing selectivity. Aspirin acetylates and inhibits both enzymes covalently. Low doses ( $<100 \mathrm{mg} /$ day) inhibit preferentially, but not exclusively, COX-1, whereas higher doses inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2.

Both COX-1 and COX-2 promote the uptake of two molecules of oxygen by cyclization of arachidonic acid to yield a $\mathrm{C}_{9}-\mathrm{C}_{11}$ endoperoxide $\mathrm{C}_{15}$ hydroperoxide (Figure 18-2). This product is $\mathrm{PGG}_{2}$, which is then rapidly modified by the peroxidase moiety of the COX enzyme to add a 15 -hydroxyl group that is essential for biologic activity. This product is $\mathrm{PGH}_{2}$. Both endoperoxides are highly unstable. Analogous families- $\mathrm{PGH}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{PGH}_{3}$ and all their subsequent products-are derived from homo- $\gamma$-linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, respectively.
Figure 18-2.

Prostanoid biosynthesis. Compound names are enclosed in boxes

The prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclin, collectively termed the prostanoids, are generated from $\mathrm{PGH}_{2}$ through the action of isomerases and synthases. These terminal enzymes are expressed in a relatively cell-specific fashion, such that most cells make one or two dominant prostanoids. The prostaglandins differ from each other in two ways: (1) in the substituents of the pentane ring (indicated by the last letter, eg, E and F in PGE and PGF ) and (2) in the number of double bonds in the side chains (indicated by the subscript, eg, $\mathrm{PGE}_{1}, \mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ ). Several products of the arachidonate series are of current clinical importance. Alprostadil ( $\mathrm{PGE}_{1}$ ) may be used for its smooth muscle relaxing effects to maintain the ductus arterosus patent in some neonates awaiting cardiac surgery and in the treatment of impotence. Misoprostol, a PGE ${ }_{1}$ derivative, is a cytoprotective prostaglandin used in preventing peptic ulcer and in combination with mifepristone (RU486) for terminating early pregnancies. $\mathbf{P G E}_{\mathbf{2}}$ and $\mathbf{P G F}_{\mathbf{2}}$ are used in
obstetrics to induce labor. Latanoprost and several similar compounds are topically active $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ derivatives used in ophthalmology to treat open angle glaucoma. Prostacyclin ( PGI $_{2}$, epoprostenol) is synthesized mainly by the vascular endothelium and is a powerful vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. It is used clinically to treat pulmonary hypertension and portopulmonary hypertension. In contrast, thromboxane ( $\mathbf{T X A}_{\mathbf{2}}$ ) has undesirable properties (aggregation of platelets, vasoconstriction). Therefore TXA ${ }_{2}$-receptor antagonists and synthesis inhibitors have been developed for cardiovascular indications, although these (except for aspirin) have yet to establish a place in clinical usage.

All the naturally occurring COX products undergo rapid metabolism either initially by hydration to inactive products, which are then metabolized ( $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}, \mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ ), or by oxidation of the key 15-hydroxyl group to the corresponding ketone by prostaglandin $15-\mathrm{OH}$ dehydrogenase. Further metabolism is by $\Delta^{13}$ reduction, B oxidation, and $\omega$-oxidation. The inactive metabolites can be determined in blood and urine by immunoassay or mass spectrometry as a measure of the in vivo synthesis of their parent compounds.

\section*{Products of Lipoxygenase}

The metabolism of arachidonic acid by the 5-, 12-, and 15-lipoxygenases (LOX) results in the production of hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETEs), which rapidly convert to hydroxy derivatives (HETEs) and leukotrienes (Figure 18-3). The most actively investigated leukotrienes are those produced by the 5-lipoxygenase present in inflammatory cells (polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMNs], basophils, mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages). This pathway is of great interest since it is associated with asthma, anaphylactic shock, and cardiovascular disease. Stimulation of these cells elevates intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and releases arachidonate; incorporation of moleular oxygen by 5-LOX, in association with 5-LOX-activating protein (FLAP), then yields the unstable epoxide leukotriene $\mathrm{A}_{4}$ ( $\mathrm{LTA}_{4}$ ). This intermediate either converts to the dihydroxy leukotriene $\mathrm{B}_{4}\left(\mathrm{LTB}_{4}\right)$ or conjugates with glutathione to yield leukotriene $\mathrm{C}_{4}\left(\mathrm{LTC}_{4}\right)$, which undergoes sequential degradation of the glutathione moiety by peptidases to yield $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{LTE}_{4}$. These three products are called cysteinyl leukotrienes or peptidoleukotrienes.

Leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis. $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}, \mathrm{LTD}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{LTE}_{4}$ are known collectively as the Cysteinyl (Cys) LTs. GT, glutamyl transpeptidase; GL, glutamyl leukotrienase.

LTC 4 and LTD 4 are potent bronchoconstrictors and are recognized as the primary components of the slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) that is secreted in asthma and anaphylaxis. There are four current approaches to anti-leukotriene drug development: 5-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitors, leukotriene-receptor antagonists, inhibitors of FLAP, and phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ inhibitors. Selective leukotrienereceptor antagonists (zafirlukast, montelukast, and pranlukast) are currently used or in trials for treatment of asthma.
$\mathrm{LTA}_{4}$, the primary product of 5-LOX, can be converted via 12-LOX in platelets to the lipoxins $\mathrm{LXA}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{LXB}_{4}$. These mediators can also arise through 5-LOX metabolism of 15-HETE, the product of 15-LOX-2
metabolism of arachidonic acid. 15-LOX-1 prefers linoleic acid as a substrate forming 15S hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid. The stereochemical isomer, 15R-HETE, may be derived from the action of aspirin-acetylated COX-2 and further transformed in leukocytes by 5-LOX to 15-epi-LXA ${ }_{4}$ or 15-epi-LXB ${ }_{4}$, the so-called aspirin-triggered lipoxins. 12-HETE can also undergo a catalyzed molecular rearrangement to epoxy-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acids called hepoxilins. The biologic roles of these mediators remain illdefined.

The LOX located in epidermal cells are distinct from "conventional" enzymes-arachidonic acid and linoleic acid are apparently not the natural substrates for epidermal LOX. Epidermal accumulation of 12R-HETE is a feature of psoriasis and ichthyosis and inhibitors of 12R-LOX are under investigation for the treatment of these proliferative skin disorders.

\section*{Epoxygenase Products}

Specific isozymes of microsomal cytochrome P450 monooxygenases convert arachidonic acid to four epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) (Figure 18-1). These are the 5,6-, 6,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-oxido products. Each EET has two stereoisomers (R and $S$ ). Their biosynthesis can be altered by pharmacologic, nutritional, and genetic factors that affect P450 expression. These epoxides are unstable and rapidly form the corresponding dihydroxyeicosatrienoic (DHET) acid, eg, 5,6-DHET. Unlike the prostaglandins, both the EETs and the DHETs can be incorporated into phospholipids, which then act as storage sites. Intracellular fatty acid-binding proteins may differentially bind EETs and DHETs, thus modulating their metabolism, activities, and targeting. The epoxygenase products are synthesized in endothelial cells, and cause vasodilation in a number of vascular beds by activating the smooth muscle large conductance $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. This results in smooth muscle cell hyperpolarization and vasodilation, leading to reduced blood pressure. Substantial evidence indicates that EETs may function as endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors, particularly in the coronary circulation.

\section*{I soprostanes}

The generation of isoprostanes from arachidonic acid is another potentially important pathway. The isoprostanes are prostaglandin stereoisomers. Because prostaglandins have many asymmetric centers, they have a large number of potential stereoisomers. COX is not needed for the formation of the isoprostanes, and its inhibition with aspirin or other NSAI Ds should not affect the isoprostane pathway. The primary epimerization mechanism is peroxidation of arachidonate by free radicals. Peroxidation occurs while arachidonic acid is still esterified to the membrane phospholipids. Thus, unlike prostaglandins, these stereoisomers are "stored" as part of the membrane. They are then cleaved, presumably by phospholipases, circulate, and are excreted in urine. Isoprostanes are present in relatively large amounts (ten-fold greater in blood and urine than the COX-derived prostaglandins). They have potent vasoconstrictor effects when infused into renal and other vascular beds and may activate prostanoid receptors. It has been speculated that they may contribute to the pathophysiology of inflammatory responses in a manner insensitive to COX inhibitors.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF EI COSANOI DS MECHANISMS \& EFFECTS OF EI COSANOI DS}

\section*{Receptor Mechanisms}

As a result of their short half-lives, the eicosanoids act in an autocrine and paracrine fashion, ie, close to the site of their synthesis. These ligands bind to receptors on the cell surface, and pharmacologic specificity is determined by receptor density and type on different cells. A single gene product has been identified for the $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ receptor (IP receptor), $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ (FP), and TXA (TP), while four distinct $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ receptors (EPs 1-4) and two $\mathrm{PGD}_{2}$ receptors ( $\mathrm{DP}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{DP}_{2}$ ) have been cloned. Additional isoforms of the TP ( $a$ and B ), FP ( A and B ), and $\mathrm{EP}_{3}(\mathrm{~A}-\mathrm{D})$ receptors can arise through differential mRNA splicing. Two receptors exist for both $\mathrm{LTB}_{4}$ (BLT ${ }_{1}$ and $\mathrm{BLT}_{2}$ ) and the cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cysLT ${ }_{1}$ and cysLT ${ }_{2}$ ). A single lipoxin receptor termed ALX was found to be the same as the formyl peptide (fMPL)-1 receptor. All of these receptors are G proteincoupled; properties of the best-studied receptors are listed in Table 18-1.

$E P_{2}, E P_{4}$, IP and $D P_{1}$ receptors activate adenylyl cyclase via $G_{s}$. This leads to increased intracellular cAMP levels, which in turn activates specific protein kinases (see Chapter 2). These kinases phosphorylate internal calcium pump proteins, an action that decreases free intracellular calcium concentration. In contrast, $\mathrm{EP}_{1}, \mathrm{FP}$, and TP receptors activate phosphatidylinositol metabolism, leading to the formation of InsP ${ }_{3}\left(I P_{3}\right)$, with subsequent mobilization of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stores and an increase of free intracellular calcium. Activation of the TP-receptor isoforms may activate or inhibit adenylyl cyclase via $G_{s}(T P)$ or $G_{i}(T P \quad)$, respectively, and signal via $G_{q}$ and related proteins to membrane associated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways. $\mathrm{EP}_{3}$ receptors can couple to both elevation of intracellular calcium and a decrease in cAMP. The $\mathrm{DP}_{2}$ receptor, which is unrelated to the other prostanoid receptors, is a member of the fMLP receptor superfamily. This receptor couples through to a $G_{i}$-type $G$ protein and leads to inhibition of cAMP synthesis and increases in intracellular calcium in a variety of cell types.
$\mathrm{LTB}_{4}$ also generates InsP ${ }_{3}$ release via the $\mathrm{BLT}_{1}$ receptor, causing activation, degranulation, and superoxide anion generation in PMNs. The $\mathrm{BLT}_{2}$ receptor, the low-affinity receptor for $\mathrm{LTB}_{4}$, is bound with reasonable affinity by 12S- and 12R-HETE, although the biologic relevance of this observation is not clear. CysLT ${ }_{1}$ receptors couple to $G_{q}$, leading to increased intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.

The contractile effects of eicosanoids on smooth muscle are mediated by the release of calcium, while their relaxing effects are mediated by the generation of cAMP. The effects of eicosanoids on many target systems, including the immune system, can be similarly explained (see below). Many of the eicosanoids' contractile effects on smooth muscle can be inhibited by lowering extracellular calcium or by using calcium channel blocking drugs.

Although prostanoids can activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) if added in sufficient concentration in vitro, it is questionable whether these compounds attain concentrations sufficient to function as endogenous nuclear-receptor ligands in vivo.

\section*{Effects of Prostaglandins \& Thromboxanes}

The prostaglandins and thromboxanes have major effects on four types of smooth muscle: vascular, gastrointestinal, airway, and reproductive. Other important targets include platelets and monocytes, kidneys, the central nervous system, autonomic presynaptic nerve terminals, sensory nerve endings, endocrine organs, adipose tissue, and the eye (the effects on the eye may involve smooth muscle).

\section*{SMOOTH MUSCLE}

\section*{Vascular}

TXA $_{2}$ is a potent vasoconstrictor. It is also a smooth muscle cell mitogen and is the only eicosanoid that has convincingly been shown to have this effect. The mitogenic effect is potentiated by exposure of smooth muscle cells to testosterone, which up-regulates smooth muscle cell TP receptors. PGF2 is also a vasoconstrictor but is not a mitogen for smooth muscle cells. Another vasoconstrictor is the isoprostane 8-iso- $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$, also known as $\mathrm{iPF}_{2}$ III, which may act via the TP receptor. In patients with cirrhosis, it is produced in large amounts in the liver and is thought to play a pathophysiologic role as an important vasoconstrictor substance in the hepatorenal syndrome.

Vasodilator prostaglandins, especially $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$, promote vasodilation by increasing cAMP and decreasing smooth muscle intracellular calcium, primarily via IP and EP ${ }_{4}$ receptors. Vascular prostacyclin is synthesized by both smooth muscle and endothelial cells, with the latter being the major contributor. In the
microcirculation, $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ is a vasodilator produced by endothelial cells.

\section*{Gastrointestinal Tract}

Most of the prostaglandins and thromboxanes activate gastrointestinal smooth muscle. Longitudinal muscle is contracted by $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ (via $\mathrm{EP}_{3}$ ) and $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ (via FP receptors), whereas circular muscle is contracted strongly by $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ and weakly by $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$, and relaxed by $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ (via $\mathrm{EP}_{4}$ receptors). Administration of either $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ results in colicky cramps (see Clinical Pharmacology of Eicosanoids, below). The leukotrienes also have powerful contractile effects.

\section*{Airways}

Respiratory smooth muscle is relaxed by $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ and contracted by $\mathrm{PGD}_{2}, \mathrm{TXA}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$. Studies of $\mathrm{DP}_{1}$ knockout mice suggest an important role of this receptor in asthma. The cysteinyl leukotrienes are bronchoconstrictors. They act principally on smooth muscle in peripheral airways and are a thousand times more potent than histamine both in vitro and in vivo. They also stimulate bronchial mucus secretion and cause mucosal edema. Bronchospasm occurs in about 10\% of people taking NSAIDs, probably because of a shift in arachidonate metabolism from COX-1 metabolism to leukotriene formation.

\section*{Reproductive}

The actions of prostaglandins on reproductive smooth muscle are discussed below under Reproductive Organs.

\section*{PLATELETS}

Platelet aggregation is markedly affected by eicosanoids. Low concentrations of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ enhance, whereas higher concentrations inhibit, platelet aggregation. Both $\mathrm{PGD}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ inhibit aggregation. $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ is the major product of platelet COX-1, is a platelet aggregator, and amplifies the effects of other more potent platelet agonists such as thrombin. The platelet actions of $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ are restrained in vivo by $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$, which inhibits platelet aggregation by all recognized agonists. Platelets release TXA ${ }_{2}$ during activation and aggregation. Urinary metabolites of $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ increase in patients experiencing a myocardial infarction; this increment is suppressed substantially by low-dosage aspirin, but a variable contribution, presumably from macrophage COX-2, may be insensitive to such a regimen. Comparative trials of the cardioprotective actions of low- and high-dose aspirin have not been performed. However, indirect comparisons across placebo controlled trials do not suggest an increasing benefit with dose; in fact, they suggest an inverse dose-response relationship, perhaps reflecting increasing inhibition of $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ synthesis at higher doses of aspirin. Platelet COX-1-derived thromboxane synthesis is irreversibly inhibited by chronic dosing with aspirin in low doses. Macrophage COX-2 appears to contribute roughly $10 \%$ of the increment in TX biosynthesis observed in smokers, while the rest is derived from platelets.

\section*{KIDNEY}

Both the medulla and the cortex of the kidney synthesize prostaglandins, the medulla substantially more than the cortex. The kidney also synthesizes several hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, leukotrienes, cytochrome P450 products, and epoxides. These compounds play important autoregulatory roles in renal function by modifying renal hemodynamics and glomerular and tubular function. This regulatory role is especially important in marginally functioning kidneys, as shown by the decline in kidney function caused by COX inhibitors in elderly patients and those with renal disease.

The major eicosanoid products of the renal cortex are $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$. Both compounds increase renin release; normally, however, renin release is more directly under $B_{1}$-adrenoceptor control.
$\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ increase glomerular filtration through their vasodilating effects. These prostaglandins also increase water and sodium excretion. The increase in water clearance probably results from an attenuation of the action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) on adenylyl cyclase. It is uncertain whether the natriuretic effect is caused by the direct inhibition of sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule or by increased medullary blood flow. Loop diuretics, eg, furosemide, produce some of their effect by stimulating COX activity. In the normal kidney, this increases the synthesis of the vasodilator prostaglandins. Therefore, patient response to a loop diuretic is diminished if a COX inhibitor is administered concurrently (see Chapter 15).

TXA ${ }_{2}$ causes intrarenal vasoconstriction (and perhaps an ADH-like effect), resulting in a decline in renal function. The normal kidney synthesizes only small amounts of $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$. However, in renal conditions involving inflammatory cell infiltration (such as glomerulonephritis and renal transplant rejection), the inflammatory cells (monocyte-macrophages) release substantial amounts of TXA ${ }_{2}$. Theoretically, TXA ${ }_{2}$ synthase inhibitors or receptor antagonists should improve renal function in these patients, but no such drug is clinically available.

Hypertension is associated with increased $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ and decreased $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ synthesis in some animal models, eg, the Goldblatt kidney model. It is not known whether these changes are primary contributing factors or secondary responses. Similarly, increased TXA ${ }_{2}$ formation has been reported in cyclosporineinduced nephrotoxicity, but no causal relationship has been established.

\section*{REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS}

\section*{Female Reproductive Organs}

Uterine muscle is contracted by $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}, \mathrm{TXA}_{2}$, and low concentrations of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2} ; \mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ and high concentrations of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ cause relaxation. $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$, together with oxytocin, is essential for the onset of parturition. The effects of prostaglandins on uterine function are discussed below. (See Clinical Pharmacology of Eicosanoids.)

\section*{Male Reproductive Organs}

The role of prostaglandins in semen is still conjectural. The major source of these prostaglandins is the seminal vesicle; the prostate-despite the name "prostaglandin"-and the testes synthesize only small amounts. The factors that regulate the concentration of prostaglandins in human seminal plasma are not known in detail, but testosterone does promote prostaglandin production. Thromboxane and leukotrienes have not been found in seminal plasma. Men with a low seminal fluid concentration of prostaglandins are relatively infertile.

Smooth muscle-relaxing prostaglandins such as $\mathrm{PGE}_{1}$ enhance penile erection by relaxing the smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa. (See Clinical Pharmacology of the Eicosanoids.)

\section*{CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEMS}

\section*{Fever}

PGE $_{2}$ increases body temperature, probably via $\mathrm{EP}_{3}$ receptors, especially when administered directly into the cerebral ventricles. Exogenous $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ induce fever, whereas $\mathrm{PGD}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ do not, but none of these contributes to the natural pyretic response. Instead, pyrogens release interleukin-1, which in turn promotes the synthesis and release of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$. This synthesis is blocked by aspirin and other antipyretic compounds.

\section*{Sleep}

When infused into the cerebral ventricles, $\mathrm{PGD}_{2}$ induces natural sleep (as determined by electroencephalographic analysis) via activation of $\mathrm{DP}_{1}$ receptors and secondary release of adenosine.

\section*{Neurotransmission}

PGE compounds inhibit the release of norepinephrine from postganglionic sympathetic nerve endings. Moreover, NSAIDs increase norepinephrine release in vivo, suggesting that the prostaglandins play a physiologic role in this process. Thus, vasoconstriction observed during treatment with COX inhibitors may be due, in part, to increased release of norepinephrine as well as to inhibition of the endothelial synthesis of the vasodilators $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2} . \mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ sensitize the peripheral nerve endings to painful stimuli by lowering the threshold of nociceptors. Centrally, $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ can increase excitability in neuronal pain transmission pathways in the spinal cord. Hyperalgesia is also produced by LTB ${ }_{4}$. The release of these eicosanoids during the inflammatory process thus serves to amplify nociception.

\section*{NEUROENDOCRINE ORGANS}

Both in vitro and in vivo tests have shown that some of the eicosanoids affect the secretion of anterior pituitary hormones. PGE $_{2}$ promotes the release of growth hormone, prolactin, TSH, ACTH, FSH, and LH. However, endocrine changes reflecting significant release of these hormones have not been reported in patients receiving PGE compounds. In parturition $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ induces an oxytocin-dependent decline in progesterone levels. LOX metabolites also have endocrine effects. LTC ${ }_{4}$ and LTD ${ }_{4}$ stimulate LHRH and LH secretion (see below). 12-HETE stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex and mediates a portion of the aldosterone release stimulated by angiotensin II but not that by ACTH.

\section*{BONE METABOLISM}

Prostaglandins are abundant in skeletal tissue and are produced by osteoblasts and adjacent hematopoietic cells. The major effect of prostaglandins (especially $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$, acting on $\mathrm{EP}_{4}$ receptors) in vivo is to increase bone turnover, ie, stimulation of bone resorption and formation. Deletion of the $E P_{4}$ receptors in mice results in an imbalance between bone resorption and formation, leading to a negative balance of bone mass and density in older animals. Prostaglandins may mediate the effects of mechanical forces on bones and changes in bone during inflammation. $\mathrm{EP}_{4}$-receptor deletion and inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis have both been associated with impaired fracture healing in animal models. COX inhibitors can also slow skeletal muscle healing by interfering with prostaglandin effects on myocyte proliferation, differentiation, and fibrosis in response to injury. Prostaglandins may contribute to the bone loss that occurs at menopause; it has been speculated that NSAIDs may be of therapeutic value in osteoporosis and bone loss prevention in older women. However, controlled evaluation of such therapeutic interventions remains to be carried out.

\section*{EYE}

PGE and PGF derivatives lower intraocular pressure. The mechanism of this action is unclear but probably involves increased outflow of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber via the uveoscleral pathway (see Clinical Pharmacology of Eicosanoids).

\section*{Effects of Lipoxygenase \& Cytochrome P450-Derived Metabolites}

The actions of lipoxygenases generate compounds that can regulate specific cellular responses important in inflammation and immunity. Cytochrome P450-derived metabolites affect nephron transport functions either directly or via metabolism to active compounds (see below). The biologic functions of the various forms of hydroxy- and hydroperoxyeicosaenoic acids are largely unknown, but their pharmacologic potency
is impressive.

\section*{BLOOD CELLS AND INFLAMMATION}
$\mathrm{LTB}_{4}$ is a potent chemoattractant for PMNs, eosinophils, and monocytes; $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$ are potent chemoattractants for eosinophils. At higher concentrations, these leukotrienes also promote eosinophil adherence, degranulation, and oxygen radical formation.

The leukotrienes have been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammation, especially in chronic diseases such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease. Prostaglandins, on the other hand, generally inhibit lymphocyte function and proliferation, suppressing the immunological response. $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ inhibits the differentiation of $B$ lymphocytes into antibody-secreting plasma cells and depress the humoral antibody response. It also inhibits mitogen-stimulated proliferation of T lymphocytes and the release of lymphokines by sensitized T lymphocytes. PGE ${ }_{2}$ and TXA ${ }_{2}$ may also play a role in T-lymphocyte development by regulating apoptosis of immature thymocytes. $\mathrm{PGD}_{2}$, a major product of mast cells, is a potent chemoattractant for eosinophils and induces chemotaxis and migration of Th2 lymphocytes. Its degradation product, $15 \mathrm{~d}-\mathrm{PGJ}_{2}$, at concentrations actually formed in vivo, may also activate eosinophils via the $\mathrm{DP}_{2}$ (CRT н 2 ) receptor.

Lipoxins have diverse effects on leukocytes, including activation of monocytes and macrophages and inhibition of neutrophil, eosinophil, and lymphocyte activation. Both lipoxin A and lipoxin B inhibit natural killer cell cytotoxicity.

\section*{HEART AND SMOOTH MUSCLE}

\section*{Cardiovascular}

12(S) - HETE is a potent chemoattractant for smooth muscle cells, causing migration at low concentrations; it may play a role in myointimal proliferation that occurs after vascular injury such as that caused by angioplasty. Its stereoisomer, $12(\mathrm{R})$ - HETE, is not a chemoattractant, but is a potent inhibitor of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ $/ \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase in the cornea. $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$ reduce myocardial contractility and coronary blood flow, leading to cardiac depression. Lipoxin A and lipoxin B exert coronary vasoconstrictor effects in vitro.

\section*{Gastrointestinal}

Human colonic epithelial cells synthesize $\mathrm{LTB}_{4}$, a chemoattractant for neutrophils. The colonic mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease contains substantially increased amounts of LTB $_{4}$.

\section*{Airways}

The cysteinyl leukotrienes, particularly $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$, are potent bronchoconstrictors and cause increased microvascular permeability, plasma exudation, and mucus secretion in the airways. Controversies exist over whether the pattern and specificity of the leukotriene receptors differ in animal models and humans. $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}$-specific receptors have not been found in human lung tissue, whereas both high- and low-affinity $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$ receptors are present.

\section*{RENAL SYSTEM}

The roles of leukotrienes and cytochrome P450 products in the human kidney are currently speculative, but the 5,6-epoxide has been shown to be a powerful vasodilator in animal experiments.

\section*{CANCER}

There has been significant interest in the role of prostaglandins and COX-2 in the development of malignancies. Angiogenesis, which is required for multistage carcinogenesis, is promoted by COX-2-derived $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$, as well as $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$. COX inhibitors reduce colon tumor formation in experimental animals. In
large epidemiologic studies, the incidental use of NSAIDs is associated with a 40-50\% reduction in relative risk for developing colon cancer. Furthermore, in patients with familial polyposis coli, COX inhibitors significantly decrease polyp formation. A polymorphism in COX-2 has been associated with increased risk of colon cancer. Several studies have suggested that COX-2 expression is associated with markers of tumor progression in breast cancer. In mouse mammary tissue, COX-2 is pro-oncogenic whereas aspirin use is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer in women, especially for hormone receptor-positive tumors.

\section*{MI SCELLANEOUS}

The effects of these products on the reproductive organs remain to be elucidated. Similarly, actions on the nervous system have been suggested but not confirmed. 12-HETE stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex and mediates a portion of the aldosterone release stimulated by angiotensin II but not that by ACTH. Very low concentrations of $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}$ increase and higher concentrations of arachidonatederived epoxides augment LH and LHRH release from isolated rat anterior pituitary cells.

\section*{I NHI BITION OF EI COSANOI D SYNTHESIS}

Corticosteroids block all the known pathways of eicosanoid synthesis, perhaps by stimulating the synthesis of several inhibitory proteins collectively called annexins or lipocortins. They inhibit phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ activity, probably by interfering with phospholipid binding and thus preventing the release of arachidonic acid.

The NSAIDs (eg, indomethacin, ibuprofen) block both prostaglandin and thromboxane formation by reversibly inhibiting COX activity. The traditional NSAIDs are not selective for COX-1 or COX-2. Selective COX-2 inhibitors, which were developed more recently, vary in their degree of selectivity. Aspirin is an irreversible COX inhibitor. In platelets, which are anuclear, COX cannot be restored via protein biosynthesis resulting in extended inhibition of TXA ${ }_{2}$ biosynthesis.

EP-receptor agonists and antagonists are under evaluation in the treatment of bone fracture and osteoporosis, whereas TP-receptor antagonists are being investigated for usefulness in treatment of cardiovascular syndromes.

Selective inhibitors of the lipoxygenase pathway are also mainly investigational. With a few exceptions, NSAIDs do not inhibit lipoxygenase activity at concentrations that markedly inhibit COX activity. In fact, by preventing arachidonic acid conversion via the COX pathway, NSAI Ds may cause more substrate to be metabolized through the lipoxygenase pathways, leading to an increased formation of the inflammatory leukotrienes. Even among the COX-dependent pathways, inhibiting the synthesis of one derivative may increase the synthesis of an enzymatically related product. Therefore, drugs that inhibit both COX and lipoxygenase are being developed.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF EI COSANOI DS}

Several approaches have been used in the clinical application of eicosanoids. First, stable oral or parenteral long-acting analogs of the naturally occurring prostaglandins have been developed. Several such compounds have been approved for clinical use overseas and are being introduced in the USA (Figure 18-4). Second, enzyme inhibitors and receptor antagonists have been developed to interfere with the synthesis or effects of the eicosanoids. The discovery of COX-2 as a major source of inflammatory prostanoids led to the development of selective COX-2 inhibitors in an effort to preserve the gastrointestinal
and renal functions directed through COX-1, thereby reducing toxicity. Third, dietary manipulation-to change the polyunsaturated fatty acid precursors in the cell membrane phospholipids and so change eicosanoid synthesis-is used extensively in over-the-counter products and in diets emphasizing increased consumption of cold water fish.

\section*{Female Reproductive System}

Studies with knockout mice have confirmed a role for prostaglandins in reproduction and parturition. COX-1-derived $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ appears important for luteolysis, consistent with delayed parturition in COX-1-deficient mice. A complex interplay between $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ and oxytocin is critical to the onset of labor. $\mathrm{EP}_{2}$ receptordeficient mice demonstrate a preimplantation defect, which underlies some of the breeding difficulties seen in COX-2 knockouts.

\section*{ABORTION}
$\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ have potent oxytocic actions. The ability of the E and F prostaglandins and their analogs to terminate pregnancy at any stage by promoting uterine contractions has been adapted to common clinical use. Many studies worldwide have established that prostaglandin administration efficiently terminates pregnancy. The drugs are used for first- and second-trimester abortion and for priming or ripening the cervix before abortion. These prostaglandins appear to soften the cervix by increasing proteoglycan content and changing the biophysical properties of collagen.

Dinoprostone, a synthetic preparation of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$, is administered vaginally for oxytocic use. In the USA, it is approved for inducing abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy, for missed abortion, for benign hydatidiform mole, and for ripening of the cervix for induction of labor in patients at or near term.

Dinoprostone stimulates the contraction of the uterus throughout pregnancy. As the pregnancy progresses, the uterus increases its contractile response, and the contractile effect of oxytocin is potentiated as well. Dinoprostone also directly affects the collagenase of the cervix, resulting in softening. The vaginal dose enters the maternal circulation, and a small amount is absorbed directly by the uterus via the cervix and the lymphatic system. Dinoprostone is metabolized in local tissues and on the first pass through the lungs (about $95 \%$ ). The metabolites are mainly excreted in the urine. The plasma half-life is $2.5-5$ minutes.

For the induction of labor, dinoprostone is used either as a gel ( $0.5 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ ) or as a controlled-release formulation ( $10 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ ) that releases $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ in vivo at a rate of about $0.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{h}$ over 12 hours. An advantage of the controlled-release formulation is a lower incidence of gastrointestinal side effects (< 1\%).

For abortifacient purposes, the recommended dosage is a $20-\mathrm{mg}$ dinoprostone vaginal suppository repeated at 3 - to 5 -hour intervals depending on the response of the uterus. The mean time to abortion is 17 hours, but in more than $25 \%$ of cases the abortion is incomplete and requires additional intervention.

For softening of the cervix at term, the preparations used are either a single vaginal insert containing 10 $\mathrm{mg} \mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ or a vaginal gel containing $0.5 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ administered every 6 hours. The softening of the cervix for induction of labor substantially shortens the time to onset of labor and the delivery time.

The use of PGE analogs for "menstrual regulation" or very early abortions-within 1-2 weeks after the last menstrual period-has been explored extensively. There are two problems: prolonged vaginal bleeding and severe menstrual cramps.

Antiprogestins (eg, mifepristone, RU486 ) have been combined with an oral oxytocic prostaglandin (eg, misoprostol ) to produce early abortion. This regimen is available in the USA and Europe (see Chapter 39). The ease of use and the effectiveness of the combination have aroused considerable opposition in some quarters. The major toxicities are cramping pain and diarrhea. The oral and vaginal routes of administration of misoprostol are equally effective, but the vaginal route has been associated with an increased incidence of sepsis, so the oral route is now recommended by all authorities.
$\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ is available for clinical gynecologic use. This drug, carboprost tromethamine (15-methyl- $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$; the 15-methyl group prolongs the duration of action) is used to induce second-trimester abortions and to control postpartum hemorrhage that is not responding to conventional methods of management. The success rate is approximately $80 \%$. It is administered as a single $250-\mathrm{mcg}$ intramuscular injection, repeated if necessary. Vomiting and diarrhea occur commonly, probably because of gastrointestinal smooth muscle stimulation. Transient elevations in temperature are seen in approximately one eighth of patients.

FACI LITATION OF LABOR

Numerous studies have shown that $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}, \mathrm{PGF}_{2}$, and their analogs effectively initiate and stimulate labor, but $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ is one tenth as potent as $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$. There appears to be no difference in the efficacy of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ when they are administered intravenously; however, they may be of more use locally to promote labor through ripening of the cervix. These agents and oxytocin have similar success rates and comparable induction-to-delivery intervals. The adverse effects of the prostaglandins are moderate, with a slightly higher incidence of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea than that produced by oxytocin. $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ has more gastrointestinal toxicity than $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$. Neither drug has significant maternal cardiovascular toxicity in the recommended doses. In fact, $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ must be infused at a rate about 20 times faster than that used for induction of labor to decrease blood pressure and increase heart rate. $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ is a bronchoconstrictor and should be used with caution in women with asthma; however, neither asthma attacks nor bronchoconstriction have been observed during the induction of labor. Although both $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ pass the fetoplacental barrier, fetal toxicity is uncommon.

The effects of oral $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ administration ( $0.5-1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{h}$ ) have been compared with those of intravenous oxytocin and oral demoxytocin, an oxytocin derivative, in the induction of labor. Oral $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ is superior to the oral oxytocin derivative and in most studies is as efficient as intravenous oxytocin. Oral PGF ${ }_{2}$ causes too much gastrointestinal toxicity to be useful by this route.

Theoretically, $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ should be superior to oxytocin for inducing labor in women with preeclampsia-eclampsia or cardiac and renal diseases because, unlike oxytocin, they have no antidiuretic effect. In addition, $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ has natriuretic effects. However, the clinical benefits of these effects have not been documented. In cases of intrauterine fetal death, the prostaglandins alone or with oxytocin seem to cause delivery effectively.

\section*{DYSMENORRHEA}

Primary dysmenorrhea is attributable to increased endometrial synthesis of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ during menstruation, with contractions of the uterus that lead to ischemic pain. NSAIDs successfully inhibit the formation of these prostaglandins (see Chapter 36) and so relieve dysmenorrhea in 75-85\% of cases. Some of these drugs are available over the counter. Aspirin is also effective in dysmenorrhea, but because it has low potency and is quickly hydrolyzed, large doses and frequent administration are necessary. In addition, the acetylation of platelet COX, causing irreversible inhibition of platelet TXA ${ }_{2}$ synthesis, may increase the amount of menstrual bleeding.

\section*{Male Reproductive System}

Intracavernosal injection or urethral suppository therapy with alprostadil ( $\mathrm{PGE}_{1}$ ) is a second line treatment for erectile dysfunction. Doses of $2.5-25 \mathrm{mcg}$ are used. Penile pain is a frequent side effect, which may be related to the algesic effects of PGE derivatives; however, only a few patients discontinue the use because of pain. Prolonged erection and priapism are less frequent side effects that occur in less than $4 \%$ of patients and are minimized by careful titration to the minimal effective dose. When given by injection, alprostadil may be used as monotherapy or in combination with either papaverine or phentolamine.

\section*{Renal System}

Increased biosynthesis of prostaglandins has been associated with one form of Bartter's syndrome. This is a rare disease characterized by low-to-normal blood pressure, decreased sensitivity to angiotensin, hyperreninemia, hyperaldosteronism, and excessive loss of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. There also is an increased excretion of
prostaglandins, especially PGE, in the urine. After long-term administration of COX inhibitors, sensitivity to angiotensin, plasma renin values, and the concentration of aldosterone in plasma return to normal. Although plasma $\mathrm{K}^{+}$rises, it remains low, and urinary wasting of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$persists. Whether an increase in prostaglandin biosynthesis is the cause of Bartter's syndrome or a reflection of a more basic physiologic defect is not yet known.

\section*{Cardiovascular System}

The vasodilator effects of PGE compounds have been studied extensively in hypertensive patients. These compounds also promote sodium diuresis. Practical application will require derivatives with oral activity, longer half-lives, and fewer adverse effects.

\section*{PULMONARY HYPERTENSION}

Prostacyclin lowers peripheral, pulmonary, and coronary resistance. It has been used to treat both primary pulmonary hypertension and secondary pulmonary hypertension, which sometimes occurs after mitral valve surgery. In addition, prostacyclin has been used successfully to treat portopulmonary hypertension, which arises secondary to liver disease. A commercial preparation of prostacyclin (epoprostenol) is approved for treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension, in which it appears to improve symptoms, prolong survival, and delay or prevent the need for lung or lung-heart transplantation. However, because of its extremely short plasma half-life, the drug must be administered as a continuous intravenous infusion through a central line. Several prostacyclin analogs with longer half-lives have been developed, and treprostinil is approved for use in pulmonary hypertension. This drug is administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion.

\section*{PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE}

A number of studies have investigated the use of PGE and PGI ${ }_{2}$ compounds in Raynaud's phenomenon and peripheral atherosclerosis. In the latter case, prolonged infusions have been used to permit remodeling of the vessel wall and to enhance regression of ischemic ulcers.

\section*{PATENT DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS}

Patency of the fetal ductus arteriosus depends on COX-2-derived $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ acting on the $\mathrm{EP}_{4}$ receptor. At birth, reduced $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ levels, a consequence of increased $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ metabolism, allow ductus arteriosus closure. In certain types of congenital heart disease (eg, transposition of the great arteries, pulmonary atresia, pulmonary artery stenosis), it is important to maintain the patency of the neonate's ductus arteriosus before corrective surgery. This is done with alprostadil, $\mathrm{PGE}_{1}$. Like $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}, \mathrm{PGE}_{1}$ is a vasodilator and an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, and it contracts uterine and intestinal smooth muscle. Adverse effects include apnea, bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperpyrexia. Because of rapid pulmonary clearance, the drug must be continuously infused at an initial rate of $0.05-0.1 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$, which may be increased to 0.4 $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$. Prolonged treatment has been associated with ductal fragility and rupture.

In delayed closure of the ductus arteriosus, COX inhibitors are often used to inhibit synthesis of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and so close the ductus. Premature infants in whom respiratory distress develops due to failure of ductus closure can be treated with a high degree of success with indomethacin. This treatment often precludes the need for surgical closure of the ductus.

\section*{Blood}

As noted above, eicosanoids are involved in thrombosis because TXA $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ promotes platelet aggregation and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ inhibits it. Low-dose aspirin selectively inhibits platelet COX-1. TXA ${ }_{2}$, in addition to activating platelets
amplifies the response to other platelet agonists; hence inhibition of its synthesis inhibits secondary aggregation of platelets induced by ADP, by low concentrations of thrombin and collagen, and by epinephrine.

Overview analyses have shown that low-dose aspirin reduces the secondary incidence of heart attack and stroke by about $25 \%$. It elevates the low risk of serious GI bleeds about twofold over placebo. Low-dose aspirin also reduces the incidence of first myocardial infarction. However, in this case, the benefit versus risk of GI bleeding is less clear. The effects of aspirin on platelet function are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 34.

\section*{Respiratory System}
$\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ is a powerful bronchodilator when given in aerosol form. Unfortunately, it also promotes coughing, and an analog that possesses only the bronchodilator properties has been difficult to obtain.
$\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ are both strong bronchoconstrictors and were once thought to be primary mediators in asthma. Polymorphisms in the genes for $\mathrm{PGD}_{2}$ synthase and the TP have been linked with asthma in humans, and deletion of $\mathrm{DP}_{1}$ sharply reduces allergen-induced infiltration of lymphocytes and eosinophils and airway hyperreactivity. However, the cysteinyl leukotrienes- $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}, \mathrm{LTD}_{4}$, and $\mathrm{LTE}_{4}$ - probably dominate during asthmatic constriction of the airway. As described in Chapter 20, leukotriene-receptor inhibitors (eg, zafirlukast, montelukast) are effective in asthma. A lipoxygenase inhibitor (zileuton) has also been used in asthma but is not as popular as the receptor inhibitors. It remains unclear whether leukotrienes are partially responsible for the acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Corticosteroids and cromolyn are also useful in asthma. Corticosteroids inhibit eicosanoid synthesis and thus limit the amounts of eicosanoid mediator available for release. Cromolyn appears to inhibit the release of eicosanoids and other mediators such as histamine and platelet-activating factor from mast cells.

\section*{Gastrointestinal System}

The word "cytoprotection" was coined to signify the remarkable protective effect of the E prostaglandins against peptic ulcers in animals at doses that do not reduce acid secretion. Since then, numerous experimental and clinical investigations have shown that the PGE compounds and their analogs protect against peptic ulcers produced by either steroids or NSAIDs. Misoprostol is an orally active synthetic analog of $\mathrm{PGE}_{1}$. The FDA-approved indication is for prevention of NSAID-induced peptic ulcers. The drug is administered at a dosage of 200 mcg four times daily. This and other PGE analogs (eg, enprostil) are cytoprotective at low doses and inhibit gastric acid secretion at higher doses. The adverse effects are abdominal discomfort and occasional diarrhea; both effects are dose-related. More recently, dosedependent bone pain and hyperostosis have been described in patients with liver disease who were given long-term PGE treatment.

Selective COX-2 inhibitors were developed in an effort to spare gastric COX-1 so that the natural cytoprotection by locally synthesized $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ is undisturbed (see Chapter 36). However, this benefit is seen only with highly selective inhibitors and may be offset by increased cardiovascular toxicity.

\section*{Immune System}

Cells of the immune system contribute substantially to eicosanoid biosynthesis during an immune reaction. T and B lymphocytes are not primary synthetic sources; however, they may supply arachidonic acid to monocyte-macrophages for eicosanoid synthesis. In addition, there is evidence for eicosanoid-mediated
cell-cell interaction by platelets, erythrocytes, PMNs, and endothelial cells.
The eicosanoids modulate the effects of the immune system, as illustrated by the cell-mediated immune response. $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ limit T-cell proliferation in vitro as corticosteroids do. T-cell clonal expansion is attenuated through inhibition of interleukin-1 and interleukin-2 and class II antigen expression by macrophages or other antigen-presenting cells. The leukotrienes, TXA ${ }_{2}$, and platelet-activating factor stimulate T-cell clonal expansion. These compounds stimulate the formation of interleukin-1 and interleukin- 2 as well as the expression of interleukin- 2 receptors. The leukotrienes also promote interferon$\gamma$ release and can replace interleukin- 2 as a stimulator of interferon- $\gamma$. These in vitro effects of the eicosanoids agree with in vivo findings in animals with acute organ transplant rejection, as described below.

\section*{CELL-MEDIATED ORGAN TRANSPLANT REJECTION}

Acute organ transplant rejection is a cell-mediated immune response (Chapter 56). Administration of $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ to renal transplant patients has reversed the rejection process in some cases. Experimental in vitro and in vivo data show that $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ can attenuate T -cell proliferation and rejection, which can also be seen with drugs that inhibit TXA ${ }_{2}$ and leukotriene formation. In organ transplant patients, urinary excretion of metabolites of $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ increases during acute rejection. Corticosteroids, the first-line drugs used for treatment of acute rejection because of their lymphotoxic effects, inhibit both phospholipase and COX-2 activity.

\section*{I NFLAMMATION}

Aspirin has been used to treat arthritis for approximately 100 years, but its mechanism of action-inhibition of COX activity—was not discovered until 1971. Aspirin and other anti-inflammatory agents that inhibit COX are discussed in Chapter 36. COX-2 appears to be the form of the enzyme most associated with cells involved in the inflammatory process. With the exception of $\mathrm{PGD}_{2}$, the prostanoids are not chemoattractants, but the leukotrienes and some of the HETEs (eg, 12-HETE) are strong chemoattractants. PGE $_{2}$ inhibits both antigen-driven and mitogen-induced B-lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation to plasma cells, resulting in inhibition of IgM synthesis. The concomitant elevation of serum IgE and monocyte PGE $_{2}$ synthesis, seen in patients with severe trauma and patients with Hodgkin's disease, is explained by the ability of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ to enhance immunoglobulin class switching to IgE.

\section*{RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS}

In rheumatoid arthritis, immune complexes are deposited in the affected joints, causing an inflammatory response that is amplified by eicosanoids. Lymphocytes and macrophages accumulate in the synovium, whereas PMNs localize mainly in the synovial fluid. The major eicosanoids produced by PMNs are leukotrienes, which facilitate T-cell proliferation and act as chemoattractants. Human macrophages synthesize the COX products $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ and large amounts of leukotrienes.

\section*{I NFECTI ON}

The relationship of eicosanoids to infection is not well defined. The association between the use of the antiinflammatory steroids and increased risk of infection is well established. However, NSAIDs do not seem to alter patient responses to infection.

\section*{Glaucoma}

Latanoprost, a stable long-acting $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ derivative, was the first prostanoid used for glaucoma. The success of latanoprost has stimulated development of similar prostanoids with ocular hypotensive effects, and bimatoprost, travaprost, and unoprostone are now available. These drugs act at the FP receptor and are administered as drops into the conjunctival sac once or twice daily. Adverse effects include
irreversible brown pigmentation of the iris and eyelashes, drying of the eyes, and conjunctivitis.

\section*{DIETARY MANI PULATI ON OF ARACHI DONI C ACI D METABOLI SM}

Because arachidonic acid is derived from dietary linoleic and as -linolenic acids, which are essential fatty acids, the effects of dietary manipulation on arachidonic acid metabolism have been extensively studied. Two approaches have been used. The first adds corn, safflower, and sunflower oils, which contain linoleic acid (C18:2), to the diet. The second approach adds oils containing eicosapentaenoic (C20:5) and docosahexaenoic acids (C22:6), so-called omega-3 fatty acids, from cold water fish. Both types of diet change the phospholipid composition of cell membranes by replacing arachidonic acid with the dietary fatty acids. It has been claimed that the synthesis of both $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ is reduced and that changes in platelet aggregation, vasomotor spasm, and cholesterol metabolism follow.

As indicated previously, there are many possible oxidation products of the different polyenoic acids. It is probably naive to ascribe the effects of dietary intervention reported thus far to such metabolites. However, subjects on diets containing highly saturated fatty acids clearly show increased platelet aggregation when compared with other study groups. Such diets (eg, in Finland and the USA) are associated with higher rates of myocardial infarction than are more polyunsaturated diets (eg, in I taly).

\section*{NITRIC OXI DE: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous signaling molecule that readily diffuses across cell membranes and regulates a wide range of physiologic and pathophysiologic processes including cardiovascular, inflammation, immune, and neuronal functions. Nitric oxide should not be confused with nitrous oxide ( $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ), an anesthetic gas.
*The author acknowledges the contribution of the previous authors of this chapter, George Thomas, PhD, \& Peter Ramwell, PhD.

\section*{DI SCOVERY OF ENDOGENOUSLY GENERATED NITRI C OXI DE}

The first observations of the biologic role of endogenously generated NO were made in rodent macrophages and neutrophils: In vitro exposure of these cells to endotoxin lipopolysaccharide resulted in the accumulation of significant amounts of nitrite and nitrate in the cell culture medium. Furthermore, injection of endotoxin in animals elevated urinary nitrite and nitrate, the two oxidation products of NO.

The second observation was made by investigators in 1980 who found that the ability of acetylcholine to elicit relaxation of isolated strips of rabbit aorta was entirely dependent on the presence of the endothelium. If the endothelium was removed, the vessel still exhibited normal relaxation responses to nitroglycerin, but not to acetylcholine or carbachol. They discovered that following stimulation with acetylcholine or carbachol, the endothelium released a short-lived molecule that resulted in relaxation and dilation of surrounding vascular smooth muscle. The synthesis of this factor was not affected by cyclooxygenase inhibitors, indicating that it was distinct from endothelium-derived prostacyclin. They named this vasodilator endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), since it promoted relaxation of precontracted smooth muscle preparations. In 1987, by comparing the pharmacologic and biochemical properties of the suspect molecule, three independent groups reported that EDRF and NO are the same molecule. It was later reported that other vasodilator molecules may be a part of EDRF, but it is clear that NO provides the major part of its activity. Subsequent studies revealed that NO was generated by many cells and was, like the eicosanoids (see Chapter 18), found in almost all tissues. The finding that NO is endogenously generated and elicits specific biologic effects explains why pharmacologic reagents that release NO (nitrates, nitrites, nitroprusside; see Chapters 11 and 12) are potent vasodilators.

\section*{Synthesis}

NO, written as NO to indicate an unpaired electron in its chemical structure, or simply NO, is a highly reactive signaling molecule that is made in a wide variety of cells, most prominently neurons, skeletal muscle, endothelial cells, and certain immune system cells. In these cells, NO is synthesized by one or more of three closely related NO synthase (NOS, EC 1.14.13.49) isoenzymes, each of which is encoded by a separate gene and named for the initial cell type in which it was isolated (Table 19-1). These
enzymes, neuronal NOS (nNOS or NOS-1), macrophage or inducible NOS (iNOS or NOS-2), and endothelial NOS (eNOS or NOS-3), despite their names, are each expressed in a wide variety of cell types, often with an overlapping distribution. These isoforms generate NO from the amino acid Larginine in an $\mathrm{O}_{2^{-}}$and NADPH-dependent reaction (Figure 19-1). This enzymatic reaction involves enzyme-bound cofactors, including heme, tetrahydrobiopterin, and flavin adenine dinucleotide. In the case of nNOS and eNOS, NO synthesis is evoked by agents and processes that increase cytosolic calcium concentrations. Binding of calcium-calmodulin complexes to eNOS and nNOS leads to enzyme activation. On the other hand, iNOS is not regulated by calcium, but is inducible. In macrophages and several other cell types, inflammatory mediators induce the transcriptional activation of the iNOS gene, resulting in accumulation of iNOS and generation of increased quantities of NO.

\section*{Signaling Mechanisms}

NO mediates its effects by covalent modification of proteins. There are three major effector targets of NO (Figure 19-1):

\section*{Metalloproteins}

NO interacts with metals, especially iron in heme. Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), an enzyme that generates cyclic GMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP), contains heme, which binds readily to NO. NO binding to heme results in activation of sGC and elevation in intracellular cGMP levels. cGMP activates protein kinase G (PKG), which phosphorylates specific proteins. NO exerts vasodilatory effects (Chapter 12), which are largely mediated by NO-dependent elevations in cGMP and PKG activity. Several other metalloproteins are targets of NO. The affinity of NO for iron is also responsible for its inhibitory effect on enzymes that contain iron-sulfur clusters such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme aconitase. NO inhibits mitochondrial respiration by inhibition of cytochrome oxidase. Inhibition
of the heme-containing cytochrome P450 enzymes by NO is a major pathogenic mechanism in inflammatory liver disease.

\section*{Thiols}

NO reacts with thiols (compounds containing the -SH group) to form nitrosothiols. In proteins, the thiol moiety is found in the amino acid cysteine. Upon exposure to NO, certain proteins are found to accumulate nitrosothiols, which can activate or inhibit the activity of these proteins. This posttranslational modification, termed S-nitrosylation, is reversed by chemical reduction by intracellular reducing agents. The formation of nitrosothiols is not mediated by direct reaction of NO with thiols, but rather requires either metals or oxygen to catalyze the formation of this adduct. Indeed, NO undergoes both oxidative and reductive reactions, resulting in the formation of a variety of oxides of nitrogen that can nitrosylate thiols, nitrate tyrosines (below), or which are stable oxidation products (Table 19-2). Hras, a regulator of cell proliferation, is activated by S-nitrosylation, while the metabolic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is inhibited when it is S-nitrosylated. Glutathione, a major intracellular sulfhydryl-containing compound, also interacts with NO under physiologic conditions to generate S-nitrosoglutathione, a more stable form of NO. Nitrosoglutathione may serve as an endogenous long-lived adduct or carrier of NO. Vascular glutathione is decreased in diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis, and this may account for the increased incidence of cardiovascular complications in these conditions.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Name & Symbol & Known Function \\
\hline Nitric oxide & NO & Vasodilator, platelet inhibitor, immune regulator, neurotransmitter \\
\hline Nitroxyl anion & $\mathrm{NO}^{-}$ & Smooth muscle relaxant \\
\hline Nitrogen dioxide & $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ & Free radical, nitrosating agent, lung irritant \\
\hline Nitrous oxide & $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ & Anesthetic \\

\hline Nitrite & $\mathrm{NO}_{2}{ }^{-}$ & Produces NO at acidic pH \\
\hline Nitrate & $\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ & Stable oxidation product of NO \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Tyrosine Nitration}

NO reacts very efficiently with superoxide to form peroxynitrite ( $\mathrm{ONOO}^{-}$), a powerful oxidant that leads to DNA damage, irreversible nitration of tyrosine, and oxidation of cysteine to disulfides or to various oxides ( $\mathrm{SO}_{\mathrm{X}}$ ). In several diseases, cellular degeneration, due to apoptotic mechanisms or due to ischemia, leads to excess superoxide production, and a consequent increase in peroxynitrite levels. Numerous proteins have been found to contain nitrotyrosines, and this modification can be associated with either activation or inhibition of protein function. However, it is not yet clear whether tyrosine nitration has essential roles in either physiologic signaling or in the pathology of any disease. Protein tyrosine nitration is also used as a marker for the presence of oxidative and nitrosative stress. Peroxynitrite-mediated protein modification is regulated by the cellular content of glutathione, which can protect against tissue damage by scavenging peroxynitrite. Factors that regulate the biosynthesis and decomposition of glutathione may have important consequences on the toxicity of NO.

\section*{Inactivation}

The lability of NO is related to its rapid reactions with metals and reactive oxygen species. Thus, NO reacts with heme and hemoproteins, including oxyhemoglobin, which catalyzes NO oxidation to nitrate. NO reactions with hemoglobin may also result in partial S-nitrosylation of hemoglobin, resulting in transport of NO throughout the vasculature. NO is also inactivated by superoxide, and scavengers of superoxide anion such as superoxide dismutase may protect NO, enhancing its potency and prolonging its duration of action.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGI C MANI PULATI ON OF NITRI C OXI DE}

\section*{Inhibitors of Nitric Oxide Synthesis}

The primary strategy to inhibit the generation of NO in cells is to use NOS inhibitors. The majority of these inhibitors are arginine analogs that bind to the NOS arginine-binding site. Since each of the NOS isoforms has high sequence similarity, most of these inhibitors do not exhibit selectivity for any of the NOS isoforms. In many disorders, such as inflammation and sepsis (see below), inhibition of the iNOS isoform is desired, whereas in neurodegenerative conditions, nNOS-specific inhibitors are needed. However, administration of nonselective NOS inhibitors leads to concurrent inhibition of eNOS, which impairs its homeostatic signaling and also results in vasoconstriction and potential ischemic damage. Thus, newer NOS isoform-selective inhibitors are being designed that exploit subtle differences in substrate-binding sites between the isoforms, as well as newer inhibitors that prevent NOS dimerization, the conformation required for enzymatic activity. The efficacy of NOS isoform-selective inhibitors in medical conditions is under investigation.

\section*{Nitric Oxide Donors}

NO donors, which release NO or related NO species, are used to elicit smooth muscle relaxation. Different classes of NO donors have differing biologic properties, related to the nature of the NO species that is released and the mechanism that relates to their release.

\section*{Organic Nitrates}

Nitroglycerin, which dilates veins and coronary arteries, is metabolized to NO by mitochondrial aldehyde reductase, an enzyme enriched in venous smooth muscle, accounting for the potent
venodilating activity of this molecule. Other organic nitrates, such as isosorbide dinitrate are metabolized to an NO-releasing species through a currently unidentified enzyme. Organic nitrates have less significant effects on aggregation of platelets, which appear to lack the enzymatic pathways necessary for rapid metabolic activation. Organic nitrates are limited by the loss of therapeutic effect during continuous administration. This nitrate tolerance may derive from NO-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial aldehyde reductase.

\section*{Organic Nitrites}

Organic nitrites, such as the volatile antianginal isoamylnitrite, also require metabolic activation to elicit vasorelaxation, although the responsible enzyme has not been identified. Nitrites are arterial vasodilators and do not exhibit the rapid tolerance seen with nitrates.

\section*{Sodium Nitroprusside}

Sodium nitroprusside, which is used for rapid pressure reduction in arterial hypertension, generates NO in response to light as well as chemical or enzymatic mechanisms in cell membranes. See Chapter 11 for additional details.

\section*{Hybrid NO Donors}

A new strategy involves the incorporation of NO-donating moieties onto currently available cardiovascular drugs. This approach is being tested with drugs such as aspirin and the angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor captopril. SNOCap, which incorporates a nitrosothiol moiety on captopril, is currently being examined for its efficacy in cardiovascular disorders.

\section*{NO Gas Inhalation}

NO itself can be used therapeutically. Inhalation of NO results in reduced pulmonary artery pressure and improved perfusion of ventilated areas of the lung. Inhaled NO has been used for acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute hypoxemia, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation with evidence for short-term improvements in pulmonary function.

\section*{Alternate Strategies}

Another mechanism to enhance the activity of NO is to enhance the downstream NO signaling pathway. Sildenafil, an inhibitor of type 5 phosphodiesterase, results in prolongation of the duration of NO-induced cGMP elevations in a variety of tissues (see Chapter 12).

\section*{NITRIC OXI DE IN DI SEASE VASCULAR EFFECTS}

NO has a significant effect on vascular smooth muscle tone and blood pressure. Numerous endothelium-dependent vasodilators, such as acetylcholine and bradykinin, act by increasing intracellular calcium levels, which induces NO synthesis. Mice with a knockout mutation in the eNOS gene display increased vascular tone and elevated mean arterial pressure, indicating that eNOS is a fundamental regulator of blood pressure. The effects of vasopressor drugs are increased by inhibition of NOS.

Apart from being a vasodilator, NO protects against thrombosis and atherogenesis through several mechanisms. A major mechanism involves the inhibition of proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle. In animal models, myointimal proliferation following angioplasty can be blocked by NO
donors, by NOS gene transfer, and by NO inhalation.
The antithrombotic effects of NO are also mediated by NO-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation. Both endothelial cells and platelets themselves contain eNOS, which acts to regulate thrombus formation. Thus, endothelial dysfunction and the associated decrease in NO generation may result in abnormal platelet function. As in vascular smooth muscle, cGMP mediates the effect of NO in platelets. NO may have an additional inhibitory effect on blood coagulation by enhancing fibrinolysis via an effect on plasminogen.

NO also reduces endothelial adhesion of monocytes and leukocytes, key features of the early development of atheromatous plaques. This effect is due to the inhibitory effect of NO on the expression of adhesion molecules on the endothelial surface. In addition, NO may act as an antioxidant, blocking the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins and thus preventing or reducing the formation of foam cells in the vascular wall. Plaque formation is also affected by NO-dependent reduction in endothelial cell permeability to lipoproteins. The importance of eNOS in cardiovascular disease is supported by experiments showing increased atherosclerosis in animals deficient in eNOS by pharmacologic inhibition. Atherosclerosis risk factors, such as smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension, are associated with decreased endothelial NO production, and thus enhance atherogenesis.

\section*{SEPTIC SHOCK}

As mentioned previously, increased urinary excretion of nitrate, the oxidative product of NO, is a feature of gram-negative bacterial infection. Lipopolysaccharide components from the bacterial wall induce synthesis of iNOS, resulting in exaggerated hypotension, shock, and, in some cases, death. This hypotension is reversed by NOS inhibitors such as L-NMMA (Table 19-3) in humans as well as in animal models. A similar reversal of hypotension is produced by compounds that prevent the action of NO (such as methylene blue), as well as by scavengers of NO (such as hemoglobin). Furthermore, knockout mice lacking a functional iNOS gene are more resistant to endotoxin than wild-type mice. However, thus far there has been no correlation between the hemodynamic effects of relatively nonselective NOS inhibitors and survival rate in gram-negative sepsis. The absence of benefit may reflect the inability of the NOS inhibitors to differentiate between NOS isoforms or may reflect concurrent inhibition of beneficial aspects of iNOS signaling.

\section*{I NFLAMMATION}

The host response to infection or injury involves the recruitment of leukocytes and the release of inflammatory mediators, including NO. Numerous cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1, as well as bacterial-derived mediators, induce the transcription of iNOS in leukocytes, fibroblasts, and other cell types, accounting for enhanced levels of NO. NO is an important microbicide and may have important roles in tissue adapting to inflammatory states. However, overproduction of NO may exacerbate tissue injury in both acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. NO generated during inflammation is involved in the vasodilation associated with acute inflammation and can interact with superoxide to generate peroxynitrite and subsequently modify proteins, lipids, and nucleotides. In experimental models of acute inflammation, inhibitors of iNOS have a dose-dependent protective effect, suggesting that NO promotes edema and vascular permeability. NO has a detrimental effect in chronic models of arthritis; dietary l-arginine supplementation exacerbates arthritis, whereas protection is seen with iNOS inhibitors. Psoriasis lesions, airway epithelium in asthma, and inflammatory bowel lesions in humans all demonstrate elevated levels of NO and iNOS. Synovial fluid from patients with arthritis contains increased oxidation products of NO, particularly peroxynitrite. Recent studies have shown that NO stimulates the synthesis of inflammatory prostaglandins by activating cyclooxygenase isoenzyme II (COX-2). Thus, inhibition of the NO pathway may have a beneficial effect on inflammatory diseases, including joint diseases.

However, NO also appears to play an important protective role in the body via immune cell function. When challenged with foreign antigens, TH1 cells (see Chapter 56) respond by synthesizing NO. Inhibition of NOS and knockout of the iNOS gene can markedly impair the protective response to injected parasites in animal models.

\section*{THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM}

NO has been proposed to have a major role in the central nervous system-as a neurotransmitter, as a modulator of ligand-gated receptors, or both. NO synthesis is induced at postsynaptic sites in neurons upon activation of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor, which results in calcium influx and activation of nNOS. In several neuronal subtypes, eNOS is also present and activated by neurotransmitter pathways that lead to calcium influx. NO synthesized postsynaptically may function as a retrograde messenger and diffuse to the presynaptic terminal to enhance the efficiency of neurotransmitter release through a cGMP or S-nitrosylation-dependent mechanism. It has been suggested that a major role for NO is in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, the molecular process that underlies learning and behavior.

\section*{THE PERI PHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM}

Nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (NANC) neurons are widely distributed in peripheral tissues, especially the gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts (see Chapter 6). Considerable evidence implicates NO as a mediator of certain NANC actions, and some NANC neurons appear to release NO. Penile erection is thought to be caused by the release of NO from NANC neurons; it is well documented that NO promotes relaxation of the smooth muscle in the corpora cavernosa-the initiating factor in penile erection-and inhibitors of NOS have been shown to prevent erection caused by pelvic nerve stimulation in the rat. Thus, impotence is a possible clinical indication for the use of a NO donor, and trials have been carried out with nitroglycerin ointment and the nitroglycerin patch. An established approach is to inhibit the breakdown of cGMP by the phosphodiesterase (PDE isoform 5) present in the smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa with drugs such as sildenafil (see Chapter 12).

\section*{RESPI RATORY DI SORDERS}

NO has been shown to improve cardiopulmonary function in adult patients with pulmonary artery hypertension and is approved for this indication (see Preparations Available). It is administered by inhalation. It has also been administered by inhalation to newborns with pulmonary hypertension and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The current treatment for severely defective gas exchange in the newborn is with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which does not directly affect pulmonary vascular pressures. NO inhalation decreases pulmonary arterial pressure and improves blood oxygenation. Thus, when pulmonary resistance is elevated, it is possible to exploit the vasodilator properties of NO by administering it via inhalation of a few parts per million. Adults with respiratory distress syndrome also appear-in open trials-to benefit from NO inhalation. NO may have an additional role in relaxing airway smooth muscle and thus acting as a bronchodilator. For these reasons, NO inhalation therapy is being widely tested in both infants and adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The adverse effects of this use of NO are being assessed.

\section*{DRUGS USED IN ASTHMA: I NTRODUCTION}

Asthma is characterized clinically by recurrent bouts of coughing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing; physiologically by widespread, reversible narrowing of the bronchial airways and a marked increase in bronchial responsiveness to inhaled stimuli; and pathologically by lymphocytic, eosinophilic inflammation of the bronchial mucosa. It is also characterized pathologically by remodeling of the bronchial mucosa, with deposition of collagen beneath the epithelium's lamina reticularis and hyperplasia of the cells of all structural elements-vessels, smooth muscle, and secretory glands and goblet cells.

In mild asthma, symptoms occur only occasionally, as on exposure to allergens or certain pollutants, on exercise, or after a viral upper respiratory infection. More severe forms of asthma are associated with frequent attacks of wheezing dyspnea, especially at night, and may be associated with chronic airway narrowing, causing chronic respiratory impairment. These consequences of asthma are regarded as largely preventable, because effective treatments for relief of acute bronchoconstriction ("short term relievers") and for reduction in symptoms and prevention of attacks ("long-term controllers") are available (but underutilized).

The causes of airway narrowing in acute asthmatic attacks include contraction of airway smooth muscle, inspissation of thick, viscid mucus plugs in the airway lumen, and thickening of the bronchial mucosa from edema, cellular infiltration, and hyperplasia of secretory, vascular, and smooth muscle cells. Of these causes of airway obstruction, contraction of smooth muscle is most easily reversed by current therapy; reversal of the edema and cellular infiltration requires sustained treatment with anti-inflammatory agents.

Short-term relief is thus most effectively achieved by agents that relax airway smooth muscle, of which Badrenoceptor stimulants (see Chapter 9) are the most effective and most widely used. Theophylline, a methylxanthine drug, and antimuscarinic agents (see Chapter 8) are also used for reversal of airway constriction.

Long-term control is most effectively achieved with an anti-inflammatory agent such as an inhaled corticosteroid. It can also be achieved, though less effectively, with a leukotriene pathway antagonist or an inhibitor of mast cell degranulation, such as cromolyn or nedocromil. Finally, clinical trials have established the efficacy of treatment for asthma with a humanized monoclonal antibody, omalizumab, which is specifically targeted against IgE, the antibody responsible for allergic sensitization.

The distinction between "short-term relievers" and "long-term controllers" has become blurred. Theophylline, regarded as a bronchodilator, inhibits some lymphocyte functions and modestly reduces airway mucosal inflammation. Inhaled corticosteroids, regarded as long-term controllers, produce modest immediate bronchodilation. Two recently released long-acting B-adrenoceptor stimulants, salmeterol and formoterol, appear to be effective in improving asthma control when added to inhaled corticosteroid treatment.

This chapter presents the basic pharmacology of the methylxanthines, cromolyn, leukotriene pathway inhibitors, and monoclonal anti-IgE antibody-agents whose medical use is almost exclusively for pulmonary disease. The other classes of drugs listed above are discussed in relation to the therapy of asthma.

\section*{PATHOGENESIS OF ASTHMA}

The classic immunologic model of asthma presents it as a disease mediated by reaginic immune globulin (IgE). Foreign materials that provoke IgE production are described as "allergens"; the most common are proteins from house dust mite, cockroach, cat dander, molds, and pollens. The tendency to produce IgE antibodies is genetically determined; asthma and other allergic diseases cluster in families. Once produced, IgE antibodies bind to mast cells in the airway mucosa (Figure 20-1). On reexposure to a specific allergen, antigen-antibody interaction on the surface of the mast cells triggers both the release of mediators stored in the cells' granules and the synthesis and release of other mediators. The histamine, tryptase, leukotrienes $\mathrm{C}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{D}_{4}$, and prostaglandin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$, when released, diffuse through the airway mucosa triggering the muscle contraction and vascular leakage responsible for the acute bronchoconstriction of the "early asthmatic response." This response is often followed in 4-6 hours by a second, more sustained phase of bronchoconstriction, the "late asthmatic response," which is associated with an influx of inflammatory cells into the bronchial mucosa and with an increase in bronchial responsiveness that may last for several weeks after a single inhalation of allergen. The mediators responsible for this late response are thought to be cytokines characteristically produced by TH2 lymphocytes, especially interleukins 5, 9, and 13. The cytokines are thought to attract and activate eosinophils, stimulate IgE production by B lymphocytes, and directly stimulate mucus production by bronchial epithelial cells. It is not clear whether lymphocytes or mast cells in the airway mucosa are the primary source of the mediators responsible for the late inflammatory response, but the benefits of corticosteroid therapy are attributed to their inhibition of cytokine production in the airways.

Conceptual model for the immunopathogenesis of asthma. Exposure to allergen causes synthesis of IgE, which binds to mast cells in the airway mucosa. On reexposure to allergen, antigen-antibody interaction on mast cell surfaces triggers release of mediators of anaphylaxis: histamine, tryptase, prostaglandin $\mathrm{D}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PGD}_{2}\right)$, leukotriene $\mathrm{C}_{4}$, and plateletactivating factor (PAF). These agents provoke contraction of airway smooth muscle, causing the immediate fall in $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$. Reexposure to allergen also causes the synthesis and release of a variety of cytokines: interleukins 4 and 5, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and tissue growth factor (TGF) from T cells and mast cells. These cytokines in turn attract and activate eosinophils and neutrophils, whose products include eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), major basic protein (MBP), proteases, and platelet-activating factor. These mediators cause the edema, mucus hypersecretion, smooth muscle contraction, and increase in bronchial reactivity associated with the late asthmatic response, indicated by a fall in $\mathrm{FEV}_{1} 2-8$ hours after the exposure.

The allergen challenge model does not reproduce all the features of asthma. Most asthma attacks are not triggered by inhalation of allergens. They are triggered by viral respiratory infection. Some adults with asthma have no evidence of allergic sensitivity to allergens, and even in people with allergic sensitivity, the severity of symptoms correlates poorly with levels of allergen in the atmosphere. Moreover, bronchospasm
can be provoked by nonallergenic stimuli such as distilled water, exercise, cold air, sulfur dioxide, and rapid respiratory maneuvers.

This tendency to develop bronchospasm on encountering stimuli that do not affect healthy nonasthmatic airways is characteristic of asthma and is sometimes called "nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity" to distinguish it from bronchial responsiveness to specific antigens. Bronchial reactivity is assessed by measuring the fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ ) provoked by inhaling serially increasing concentrations of aerosolized methacholine. The exaggerated reactivity of the airways appears to be fundamental to asthma's pathogenesis, because it is nearly ubiquitous in patients with asthma and its degree correlates with the clinical severity of the disease.

The mechanisms underlying bronchial hyperreactivity are somehow related to inflammation of the airway mucosa. The agents that increase bronchial reactivity, such as ozone exposure, allergen inhalation, and infection with respiratory viruses, also cause airway inflammation. The increase in reactivity due to allergen inhalation is associated with an increase in both eosinophils and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in bronchial lavage fluid. The increase in reactivity that is associated with the late asthmatic response to allergen inhalation (Figure 20-1) is sustained and, because it is prevented by treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid, is thought to be caused by airway inflammation.

Whatever the mechanisms responsible for bronchial hyperreactivity, bronchoconstriction itself seems to result not simply from the direct effect of the released mediators but also from their activation of neural or humoral pathways. Evidence for the importance of neural pathways stems largely from studies of laboratory animals. The bronchospasm provoked in dogs by inhalation of histamine is reduced by pretreatment with an inhaled topical anesthetic agent, by transection of the vagus nerves, and by pretreatment with atropine. Studies of asthmatic humans, however, have shown that treatment with atropine causes only a reduction in-not abolition of-the bronchospastic responses to antigens and to nonantigenic stimuli. It is possible that activity in another neural pathway, such as the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic system, contributes to bronchomotor responses stimuli (Figure 20-2).

Mechanisms of response to inhaled irritants. The airway is represented microscopically by a cross-section of the wall with branching vagal sensory endings lying adjacent to the lumen. Afferent pathways in the vagus nerves travel to the central nervous system; efferent pathways from the central nervous system travel to efferent ganglia. Postganglionic fibers release acetylcholine (ACh), which binds to muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle. Inhaled materials may provoke bronchoconstriction by several possible mechanisms. First, they may trigger the release of chemical mediators from mast cells. Second, they may stimulate afferent receptors to initiate reflex bronchoconstriction or to release tachykinins (eg, substance P) that directly stimulate smooth muscle contraction.

The hypothesis suggested by these studies-that asthmatic bronchospasm results from a combination of release of mediators and an exaggeration of responsiveness to their effects-predicts that asthma may be effectively treated by drugs with different modes of action. Asthmatic bronchospasm might be reversed or prevented, for example, by drugs that reduce the amount of IgE bound to mast cells (anti-IgE antibody), prevent mast cell degranulation (cromolyn or nedocromil, sympathomimetic agents, calcium channel
blockers), block the action of the products released (antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists), inhibit the effect of acetylcholine released from vagal motor nerves (muscarinic antagonists), or directly relax airway smooth muscle (sympathomimetic agents, theophylline).

The second approach to the treatment of asthma is aimed not only at preventing or reversing acute bronchospasm but at reducing the level of bronchial responsiveness. Because increased responsiveness appears to be linked to airway inflammation and because airway inflammation is a feature of late asthmatic responses, this strategy is implemented both by reducing exposure to the allergens that provoke inflammation and by prolonged therapy with anti-inflammatory agents, especially inhaled corticosteroids.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF AGENTS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA}

The drugs most used for management of asthma are adrenoceptor agonists, or sympathomimetic agents (used as "relievers" or bronchodilators) and inhaled corticosteroids (used as "controllers" or antiinflammatory agents). Their basic pharmacology is presented elsewhere (see Chapters 9 and 39). In this chapter, we review their pharmacology relevant to asthma.

\section*{SYMPATHOMI METI C AGENTS}

The adrenoceptor agonists have several pharmacologic actions that are important in the treatment of asthma. They relax airway smooth muscle and inhibit release of bronchoconstricting mediators from mast cells. They may also inhibit microvascular leakage and increase mucociliary transport by increasing ciliary activity. As in other tissues, the Bagonists stimulate adenylyl cyclase and increase the formation of intracellular cAMP (Figure 20-3).
Figure 20-3.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-0598.jpg?height=649&width=1147&top_left_y=1432&top_left_x=489)

Bronchodilation is promoted by cAMP. Intracellular levels of cAMP can be increased by $B$-adrenoceptor agonists, which increase the rate of its synthesis by adenylyl cyclase (AC); or by phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors such as theophylline, which slow the rate of its degradation. Bronchoconstriction can be inhibited by muscarinic antagonists and possibly by adenosine antagonists.

The best-characterized action of the adrenoceptor agonists in the airways is relaxation of airway smooth muscle. Although there is no evidence for significant sympathetic innervation of human airway smooth muscle, ample evidence exists for the presence of adrenoceptors on airway smooth muscle. In general, stimulation of $B_{2}$ receptors relaxes airway smooth muscle, inhibits mediator release, and causes tachycardia and skeletal muscle tremor as side effects.

The sympathomimetic agents that have been widely used in the treatment of asthma include epinephrine, ephedrine, isoproterenol, and albuterol and other $\mathrm{B}_{2}$-selective agents (Figure 20-4). Because epinephrine and isoproterenol increase the rate and force of cardiac contraction (mediated mainly by $B_{1}$ receptors), they are reserved for special situations (see below).

Structures of isoproterenol and several $\mathrm{B}_{2}$-selective analogs.

In general, adrenoceptor agonists are best delivered by inhalation because this results in the greatest local effect on airway smooth muscle with the least systemic toxicity. Aerosol deposition depends on the particle size, the pattern of breathing (tidal volume and rate of airflow), and the geometry of the airways. Even with particles in the optimal size range of $2-5 \mathrm{~mm}, 80-90 \%$ of the total dose of aerosol is deposited in the mouth or pharynx. Particles under 1-2 $\mu$ m remain suspended and may be exhaled. Deposition can be increased by holding the breath in inspiration.

Epinephrine is an effective, rapidly acting bronchodilator when injected subcutaneously ( 0.4 mL of $1: 1000$ solution) or inhaled as a microaerosol from a pressurized canister ( 320 mcg per puff). Maximal bronchodilation is achieved 15 minutes after inhalation and lasts 60-90 minutes. Because epinephrine stimulates cand $B_{1}$ as well as $B_{2}$ receptors, tachycardia, arrhythmias, and worsening of angina pectoris are troublesome adverse effects. The cardiovascular effects of epinephrine are of value for treating the acute vasodilation and shock as well as the bronchospasm of anaphylaxis, but its use in asthma has been displaced by other, more $B_{2}$-selective agents.

Ephedrine was used in China for more than 2000 years before its introduction into Western medicine in 1924. Compared with epinephrine, ephedrine has a longer duration, oral activity, more pronounced central effects, and much lower potency. Because of the development of more efficacious and $B_{2}$-selective agonists, ephedrine is now used infrequently in treating asthma.

I soproterenol is a potent bronchodilator; when inhaled as a microaerosol from a pressurized canister, $80-120 \mathrm{mcg}$ isoproterenol causes maximal bronchodilation within 5 minutes. Isoproterenol has a 60- to 90minute duration of action. An increase in the asthma mortality rate that occurred in the United Kingdom in the mid 1960s was attributed to cardiac arrhythmias resulting from the use of high doses of inhaled isoproterenol. It is now rarely used for asthma.

\section*{Beta2 -Selective Drugs}

The $B_{2}$-selective adrenoceptor agonist drugs are the most widely used sympathomimetics for the treatment of asthma at present (Figure 20-4). These agents differ structurally from epinephrine in having a larger substitution on the amino group and in the position of the hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring. They are effective after inhaled or oral administration and have a long duration of action.

Albuterol, terbutaline, metaproterenol, and pirbuterol are available as metered-dose inhalers. Given by inhalation, these agents cause bronchodilation equivalent to that produced by isoproterenol. Bronchodilation is maximal within 15-30 minutes and persists for 3-4 hours. All can be diluted in saline for administration from a hand-held nebulizer. Because the particles generated by a nebulizer are much larger than those from a metered-dose inhaler, much higher doses must be given ( $2.5-5.0 \mathrm{mg}$ vs $100-400 \mathrm{mcg}$ ) but are no more effective. Nebulized therapy should thus be reserved for patients unable to coordinate inhalation from a metered-dose inhaler.

Albuterol and terbutaline are also available in tablet form. One tablet two or three times daily is the usual regimen; the principal adverse effects of skeletal muscle tremor, nervousness, and occasional weakness may be reduced by starting the patient on half-strength tablets for the first 2 weeks of therapy, but this route of administration presents no advantage over inhaled treatment.

Of these agents, only terbutaline is available for subcutaneous injection ( 0.25 mg ). The indications for this
route are similar to those for subcutaneous epinephrine-severe asthma requiring emergency treatment when aerosolized therapy is not available or has been ineffective-but it should be remembered that terbutaline's longer duration of action means that cumulative effects may be seen after repeated injections.

A new generation of long-acting $B_{2}$-selective agonists includes salmeterol and formoterol. Both drugs are potent selective $B_{2}$ agonists that achieve their long duration of action ( 12 hours or more) as a result of high lipid solubility. This permits them to dissolve in the smooth muscle cell membrane in high concentrations or, possibly, attach to "mooring" molecules in the vicinity of the adrenoceptor. These drugs appear to interact with inhaled corticosteroids to improve asthma control. They are not recommended as the sole therapy for asthma.

\section*{Toxicities}

The use of sympathomimetic agents by inhalation at first raised fears about possible cardiac arrhythmias and about hypoxemia acutely and tachyphylaxis or tolerance when given repeatedly. It is true that the vasodilating action of $B_{2}$-agonist treatment may increase perfusion of poorly ventilated lung units, transiently decreasing arterial oxygen tension ( Pa O 2 ). This effect is usually small, however, and may occur with any bronchodilator drug; the significance of such an effect depends on the initial Pa O 2 of the patient. Administration of supplemental oxygen, routine in treatment of an acute severe attack of asthma, eliminates any concern over this effect. The other concern, that B-agonist treatment may cause lethal cardiac arrhythmias appears unsubstantiated. In patients presenting for emergency treatment of severe asthma, irregularities in cardiac rhythm improve with the improvements in gas exchange effected by bronchodilator treatment.

The concept that $B$-agonist drugs cause worsening of clinical asthma by inducing tachyphylaxis to their own action remains unestablished. Most studies have shown only a small change in the bronchodilator response to Bstimulation after prolonged treatment with B-agonist drugs, but some studies have shown a loss in the ability of $B$-agonist treatment to inhibit the response to subsequent challenge with exercise, methacholine, or antigen challenge (referred to as a loss of bronchoprotective action).

Fears that heavy use of B-agonist inhalers could actually increase morbidity and mortality have not been borne out by careful epidemiologic investigations. Heavy use most often indicates that the patient should be receiving more effective prophylactic therapy with corticosteroids.

Although it is true that $B_{2}$-adrenoceptor agonists appear to be safe and effective bronchodilators for most patients, there is some evidence that the risk of adverse effects from chronic treatment with long-acting $B$ agonists may be greater for some individuals, possibly as a function of genetic variants for the Breceptor. Two retrospective and one prospective study have shown differences between patients homozygous for glycine versus arginine at the B-16 locus of the Breceptor. Among patients homozygous for arginine, a genotype found in $16 \%$ of the Caucasian population in the USA, but more commonly in African Americans, asthma control deteriorated with regular use of albuterol or salmeterol, whereas asthma control improved with this treatment among those homozygous for glycine at the same locus. These findings need to be replicated in larger studies, but it is tempting to speculate that a genetic variant may underlie the report of an increase in asthma mortality from regular use of a long-acting Bagonist in studies involving very large numbers of patients.

\section*{METHYLXANTHI NE DRUGS}

The three important methylxanthines are theophylline, theobromine, and caffeine. Their major source is beverages (tea, cocoa, and coffee, respectively). The importance of theophylline as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of asthma has waned as the greater effectiveness of inhaled adrenoceptor agents for acute asthma and of inhaled anti-inflammatory agents for chronic asthma has been established, but theophylline's very low cost is an important advantage for economically disadvantaged patients in societies in which health care resources are limited.

\section*{Chemistry}

As shown below, theophylline is 1,3-dimethylxanthine; theobromine is 3,7-dimethylxanthine; and caffeine is 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine. A theophylline preparation commonly used for therapeutic purposes is aminophylline, a theophylline-ethylenediamine complex. The pharmacokinetics of theophylline are discussed below (see Clinical Use of Methylxanthines). The metabolic products, partially demethylated xanthines (not uric acid), are excreted in the urine.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Several mechanisms have been proposed for the actions of methylxanthines, but none has been firmly established. At high concentrations, they can be shown in vitro to inhibit several members of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzyme family (Figure 20-3). Because the phosphodiesterases hydrolyze cyclic nucleotides, this inhibition results in higher concentrations of intracellular cAMP and, in some tissues, cGMP. Cyclic AMP is responsible for a myriad of cellular functions including, but not limited to, stimulation of cardiac function, relaxation of smooth muscle, and reduction in the immune and inflammatory activity of specific cells.

Of the various isoforms of phosphodiesterase that have been identified, PDE4 appears to be the most directly involved in actions of methylxanthines on airway smooth muscle and on inflammatory cells. The inhibition of PDE4 in inflammatory cells reduces their release of cytokines and chemokines, which in turn
results in a decrease in immune cell migration and activation.
In an effort to reduce toxicity while maintaining therapeutic efficacy, more selective inhibitors of different isoforms of PDE4 have been developed, particularly for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Several are now in advanced stages of clinical development, (eg, roflumilast, cilomilast, tofimilast ), but at the time of writing, none has been approved for clinical use by the FDA. Although several appear promising, none is entirely free of the major adverse effect of this class of drugs, nausea and vomiting.

Another proposed mechanism is inhibition of cell surface receptors for adenosine. These receptors modulate adenylyl cyclase activity, and adenosine has been shown to provoke contraction of isolated airway smooth muscle and histamine release from airway mast cells. It has been shown, however, that xanthine derivatives devoid of adenosine antagonism (eg, enprofylline) may be potent in inhibiting bronchoconstriction in asthmatic subjects.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics of Methylxanthines}

The methylxanthines have effects on the central nervous system, kidney, and cardiac and skeletal muscle as well as smooth muscle. Of the three agents, theophylline is most selective in its smooth muscle effects, whereas caffeine has the most marked central nervous system effects.

\section*{CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM EFFECTS}

In low and moderate doses, the methylxanthines-especially caffeine-cause mild cortical arousal with increased alertness and deferral of fatigue. The caffeine contained in beverages-eg, 100 mg in a cup of coffee-is sufficient to cause nervousness and insomnia in sensitive individuals and slight bronchodilation in patients with asthma. The larger doses necessary for more effective bronchodilation commonly cause nervousness and tremor in some patients. Very high doses, from accidental or suicidal overdose, cause medullary stimulation and convulsions and may lead to death.

\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS}

The methylxanthines have positive chronotropic and inotropic effects. At low concentrations, these effects appear to result from inhibition of presynaptic adenosine receptors in sympathetic nerves increasing catecholamine release at nerve endings. The higher concentrations ( $>10 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}, 2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ ) associated with inhibition of phosphodiesterase and increases in cAMP may result in increased influx of calcium. At much higher concentrations ( $>100 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ ), sequestration of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum is impaired.

The clinical expression of these effects on cardiovascular function varies among individuals. Ordinary consumption of coffee and other methylxanthine-containing beverages usually produces slight tachycardia, an increase in cardiac output, and an increase in peripheral resistance, raising blood pressure slightly. In sensitive individuals, consumption of a few cups of coffee may result in arrhythmias. In large doses, these agents also relax vascular smooth muscle except in cerebral blood vessels, where they cause contraction.

Methylxanthines decrease blood viscosity and may improve blood flow under certain conditions. The mechanism of this action is not well defined, but the effect is exploited in the treatment of intermittent claudication with pentoxifylline, a dimethylxanthine agent. However, no evidence suggests that this therapy is superior to other approaches.

\section*{EFFECTS ON GASTROI NTESTI NAL TRACT}

The methylxanthines stimulate secretion of both gastric acid and digestive enzymes. However, even
decaffeinated coffee has a potent stimulant effect on secretion, which means that the primary secretagogue in coffee is not caffeine.

\section*{EFFECTS ON KIDNEY}

The methylxanthines-especially theophylline-are weak diuretics. This effect may involve both increased glomerular filtration and reduced tubular sodium reabsorption. The diuresis is not of sufficient magnitude to be therapeutically useful.

\section*{EFFECTS ON SMOOTH MUSCLE}

The bronchodilation produced by the methylxanthines is the major therapeutic action in asthma. Tolerance does not develop, but adverse effects, especially in the central nervous system, may limit the dose (see below). In addition to their effect on airway smooth muscle, these agents-in sufficient concentration-inhibit antigen-induced release of histamine from lung tissue; their effect on mucociliary transport is unknown.

\section*{EFFECTS ON SKELETAL MUSCLE}

The respiratory actions of the methylxanthines may not be confined to the airways, for they also strengthen the contractions of isolated skeletal muscle in vitro and improve contractility and reverse fatigue of the diaphragm in patients with COPD. This effect on diaphragmatic performance-rather than an effect on the respiratory center-may account for theophylline's ability to improve the ventilatory response to hypoxia and to diminish dyspnea even in patients with irreversible airflow obstruction.

\section*{Clinical Use of Methylxanthines}

Of the xanthines, theophylline is the most effective bronchodilator, and it has been shown repeatedly both to relieve airflow obstruction in acute asthma and to reduce the severity of symptoms and time lost from work or school in patients with chronic asthma. Theophylline base is only slightly soluble in water, so it has been administered as several salts containing varying amounts of theophylline base. Most preparations are well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but absorption of rectal suppositories is unreliable.

Improvements in theophylline preparations have come from alterations in the physical state of the drugs rather than from new chemical formulations. For example, the increased surface area of anhydrous theophylline in a microcrystalline form facilitates solubilization for complete and rapid absorption after oral administration. Numerous sustained-release preparations (see Preparations Available) are available and can produce therapeutic blood levels for 12 hours or more. These preparations offer the advantages of less frequent drug administration, less fluctuation of theophylline blood levels, and, in many cases, more effective treatment of nocturnal bronchospasm.

Theophylline should be used only where methods to measure theophylline blood levels are available because it has a narrow therapeutic window, and its therapeutic and toxic effects are related to its blood level. Improvement in pulmonary function is correlated with plasma concentration in the range of 5-20 mg/L. Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, headache, and anxiety occur at concentrations of $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ in some patients and become common at concentrations greater than $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$. Higher levels (> $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ ) may cause seizures or arrhythmias; these may not be preceded by gastrointestinal or neurologic warning symptoms.

The plasma clearance of theophylline varies widely. Theophylline is metabolized by the liver, so usual doses may lead to toxic concentrations of the drug in patients with liver disease. Conversely, clearance may be increased through the induction of hepatic enzymes by cigarette smoking or by changes in diet. In normal
adults, the mean plasma clearance is $0.69 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$. Children clear theophylline faster than adults (1-1.5 $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ ). Neonates and young infants have the slowest clearance (see Chapter 60). Even when maintenance doses are altered to correct for the above factors, plasma concentrations vary widely.

Theophylline improves long-term control of asthma when taken as the sole maintenance treatment or when added to inhaled corticosteroids. It is inexpensive, and it can be taken orally. Its use, however, also requires occasional measurement of plasma levels; it often causes unpleasant minor side effects (especially insomnia); and accidental or intentional overdose can result in severe toxicity or death. For oral therapy with the prompt-release formulation, the usual dose is $3-4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ of theophylline every 6 hours. Changes in dosage result in a new steady-state concentration of theophylline in 1-2 days, so the dosage may be increased at intervals of 2-3 days until therapeutic plasma concentrations are achieved ( $10-20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ ) or until adverse effects develop.

\section*{ANTI MUSCARI NI C AGENTS}

Observation of the use of leaves from Datura stramonium for asthma treatment in India led to the discovery of atropine, a potent competitive inhibitor of acetylcholine at postganglionic "muscarinic" receptors, as a bronchodilator. Interest in the potential value of antimuscarinic agents increased with demonstration of the importance of the vagus nerves in bronchospastic responses of laboratory animals and by the development of a potent atropine analog that is poorly absorbed after aerosol administration and that is therefore relatively free of systemic atropine-like effects.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Muscarinic antagonists competitively inhibit the effect of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors (see Chapter 8). In the airways, acetylcholine is released from efferent endings of the vagus nerves, and muscarinic antagonists block the contraction of airway smooth muscle and the increase in secretion of mucus that occurs in response to vagal activity (Figure 20-2). Very high concentrations-well above those achieved even with maximal therapy-are required to inhibit the response of airway smooth muscle to nonmuscarinic stimulation. This selectivity of muscarinic antagonists accounts for their usefulness as investigative tools in examining the role of parasympathetic pathways in bronchomotor responses but limits their usefulness in preventing bronchospasm. In the doses given, antimuscarinic agents inhibit only that portion of the response mediated by muscarinic receptors, which varies by stimulus, and which further appears to vary among individuals in responses to the same stimulus.

\section*{Clinical Use of Muscarinic Antagonists}

Antimuscarinic agents are effective bronchodilators. When given intravenously, atropine, the prototypical muscarinic antagonist, causes bronchodilation at a lower dose than that needed to cause an increase in heart rate. The selectivity of atropine's effect can be increased further by administering the drug by inhalation or by use of a more selective quaternary ammonium derivative of atropine, ipratropium bromide. I pratropium can be delivered in high doses by this route because it is poorly absorbed into the circulation and does not readily enter the central nervous system. Studies with this agent have shown that the degree of involvement of parasympathetic pathways in bronchomotor responses varies among subjects. In some, bronchoconstriction is inhibited effectively; in others, only modestly. The failure of higher doses of the muscarinic antagonist to further inhibit the response in these individuals indicates that mechanisms other than parasympathetic reflex pathways must be involved.

Even in the subjects least protected by this antimuscarinic agent, however, the bronchodilation and partial
inhibition of provoked bronchoconstriction are of potential clinical value, and antimuscarinic agents are valuable for patients intolerant of inhaled $B$-agonist agents. Although antimuscarinic drugs appear to be slightly less effective than $B$-agonist agents in reversing asthmatic bronchospasm, the addition of ipratropium enhances the bronchodilation produced by nebulized albuterol in acute severe asthma.

Ipratropium appears to be at least as effective in patients with COPD that includes a partially reversible component. A longer-acting, selective antimuscarinic agent, tiotropium, is approved as a treatment for COPD. This drug is also taken by inhalation, and a single dose of 18 mcg has 24 -hour duration of action. Daily inhalation of tiotropium has been shown not only to improve functional capacity of patients with COPD, but also to reduce the frequency of exacerbations of their condition.

\section*{CORTI COSTEROI DS}

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Corticosteroids have been used to treat asthma since 1950 and are presumed to act by their broad antiinflammatory efficacy, mediated in part by inhibition of production of inflammatory cytokines (see Chapter 39). They do not relax airway smooth muscle directly but reduce bronchial reactivity and reduce the frequency of asthma exacerbations if taken regularly. Their effect on airway obstruction may be due in part to their contraction of engorged vessels in the bronchial mucosa and their potentiation of the effects of Breceptor agonists, but their most important action is inhibition of the lymphocytic, eosinophilic mucosal inflammation of asthmatic airways.

\section*{Clinical Use of Corticosteroids}

Clinical studies of corticosteroids consistently show them to be effective in improving all indices of asthma control-severity of symptoms, tests of airway caliber and bronchial reactivity, frequency of exacerbations, and quality of life. Because of severe adverse effects when given chronically, oral and parenteral corticosteroids are reserved for patients who require urgent treatment, ie, those who have not improved adequately with bronchodilators or who experience worsening symptoms despite maintenance therapy. Regular or "controller" therapy is maintained with aerosol corticosteroids.

Urgent treatment is often begun with an oral dose of $30-60 \mathrm{mg}$ prednisone per day or an intravenous dose of $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ methylprednisolone every 6 hours; the daily dose is decreased after airway obstruction has improved. In most patients, systemic corticosteroid therapy can be discontinued in a week or 10 days, but in other patients symptoms may worsen as the dose is decreased to lower levels. Because adrenal suppression by corticosteroids is related to dose and because secretion of endogenous corticosteroids has a diurnal variation, it is customary to administer corticosteroids early in the morning after endogenous ACTH secretion has peaked. For prevention of nocturnal asthma, however, oral or inhaled corticosteroids are most effective when given in the late afternoon.

Aerosol treatment is the most effective way to avoid the systemic adverse effects of corticosteroid therapy. The introduction of corticosteroids such as beclomethasone, budesonide, flunisolide, fluticasone, mometasone, and triamcinolone has made it possible to deliver corticosteroids to the airways with minimal systemic absorption. An average daily dose of four puffs twice daily of beclomethasone ( 400 $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) is equivalent to about $10-15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ of oral prednisone for the control of asthma, with far fewer systemic effects. Indeed, one of the cautions in switching patients from oral to inhaled corticosteroid therapy is to taper oral therapy slowly to avoid precipitation of adrenal insufficiency. In patients requiring continued prednisone treatment despite inhalation of standard doses of an aerosol corticosteroid, higher
doses appear to be more effective; inhaled dosages up to $2000 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{d}$ of fluticasone are effective in weaning patients from chronic prednisone therapy. Although these high doses of inhaled steroids may cause adrenal suppression, the risks of systemic toxicity from chronic use appear negligible compared with those of the oral corticosteroid therapy they replace.

A special problem caused by inhaled topical corticosteroids is the occurrence of oropharyngeal candidiasis. The risk of this complication can be reduced by having patients gargle water and spit after each inhaled treatment. Hoarseness can also result from a direct local effect of inhaled corticosteroids on the vocal cords. These agents are remarkably free of other short-term complications in adults but may increase the risks of osteoporosis and cataracts over the long term. In children, inhaled corticosteroid therapy has been shown to slow the rate of growth, but this effect appears to be transient: Asthma itself delays puberty, and there is no evidence that inhaled corticosteroid therapy in childhood influences adult height.

A novel approach to minimizing the risk of toxicity from systemic absorption of an inhaled corticosteroid underlay the development of ciclesonide. This investigational corticosteroid is inhaled as a prodrug activated by cleavage by esterases in bronchial epithelial cells. When absorbed into the circulation, the active product is tightly bound to serum proteins, and so has little access to glucocorticoid receptors in skin, eye, and bone, minimizing its risk of causing cutaneous thinning, cataracts, osteoporosis, or temporary slowing of growth.

Chronic use of inhaled corticosteroids effectively reduces symptoms and improves pulmonary function in patients with mild asthma. Such use also reduces or eliminates the need for oral corticosteroids in patients with more severe disease. In contrast to B-stimulant agents and theophylline, chronic use of inhaled corticosteroids reduces bronchial reactivity. Because of the efficacy and safety of inhaled corticosteroids, they are now routinely prescribed for patients who require more than occasional inhalations of a Bagonist for relief of symptoms. This therapy is continued for 10-12 weeks and then withdrawn to determine whether more prolonged therapy is needed. Inhaled corticosteroids are not curative. In most patients, the manifestations of asthma return within a few weeks after stopping therapy even if they have been taken in high doses for 2 years or longer.

\section*{CROMOLYN \& NEDOCROMIL}

Cromolyn sodium (disodium cromoglycate) and nedocromil sodium are stable but extremely insoluble salts (see structures below). When used as aerosols (by nebulizer or metered-dose inhaler), they effectively inhibit both antigen- and exercise-induced asthma, and chronic use (four times daily) slightly reduces the overall level of bronchial reactivity. However, these drugs have no effect on airway smooth muscle tone and are ineffective in reversing asthmatic bronchospasm; they are only of value when taken prophylactically.

Nedocromil sodium

Cromolyn is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and must be inhaled as a microfine powder or aerosolized solution. Nedocromil also has a very low bioavailability and is available only in metered-dose aerosol form.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Cromolyn and nedocromil differ structurally but are thought to share a common mechanism of action: an alteration in the function of delayed chloride channels in the cell membrane, inhibiting cell activation. This action on airway nerves is thought to be responsible for nedocromil's inhibition of cough; on mast cells, for inhibition of the early response to antigen challenge; and on eosinophils, for inhibition of the inflammatory response to inhalation of allergens. The inhibitory effect on mast cells appears to be specific for cell type, since cromolyn has little inhibitory effect on mediator release from human basophils. It may also be specific for different organs, since cromolyn inhibits mast cell degranulation in human and primate lung but not in skin. This in turn may reflect known differences in mast cells found in different sites, as in their neutral protease content.

Until recently, the idea that cromolyn inhibits mast cell degranulation was so well accepted that the inhibition of a response by cromolyn was thought to indicate the involvement of mast cells in the response. This simplistic idea has been overturned in part by the finding that cromolyn and nedocromil inhibit the function of cells other than mast cells and in part by the finding that nedocromil inhibits appearance of the late response even when given after the early response to antigen challenge, ie, after mast cell degranulation has occurred.

\section*{Clinical Use of Cromolyn \& Nedocromil}

In short-term clinical trials, pretreatment with cromolyn or nedocromil blocks the bronchoconstriction caused by allergen inhalation, by exercise, by sulfur dioxide, and by a variety of causes of occupational asthma. This acute protective effect of a single treatment makes cromolyn useful for administration shortly before exercise or before unavoidable exposure to an allergen.

When taken regularly (two to four puffs two to four times daily) by patients with perennial (nonseasonal)
asthma, both agents modestly but significantly reduce symptomatic severity and the need for bronchodilator medications. These drugs are neither as potent nor as predictably effective as inhaled corticosteroids. In general, young patients with extrinsic asthma are most likely to respond favorably. At present, the only way of determining whether a patient will respond is by a therapeutic trial for 4 weeks. The addition of nedocromil to a standard dose of an inhaled corticosteroid appears to improve asthma control.

Cromolyn solution is also useful in reducing symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Applying the solution by nasal spray or eye drops several times a day is effective in about $75 \%$ of patients, even during the peak pollen season.

Because the drugs are so poorly absorbed, adverse effects of cromolyn and nedocromil are minor and are localized to the sites of deposition. These include such minor symptoms as throat irritation, cough, and mouth dryness, and, rarely, chest tightness, and wheezing. Some of these symptoms can be prevented by inhaling a $B_{2}$-adrenoceptor agonist before cromolyn or nedocromil treatment. Serious adverse effects are rare. Reversible dermatitis, myositis, or gastroenteritis occurs in less than $2 \%$ of patients, and a very few cases of pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia and anaphylaxis have been reported. This lack of toxicity accounts for cromolyn's widespread use in children, especially those at ages of rapid growth. For children who have difficulty coordinating the use of the inhaler device, cromolyn may be given by aerosol of a $1 \%$ solution.

\section*{LEUKOTRI ENE PATHWAY INHIBITORS}

Because of the evidence of leukotriene involvement in many inflammatory diseases (see Chapter 18) and in anaphylaxis, considerable effort has been expended on the development of drugs that block the synthesis of these arachidonic acid derivatives or their receptors. Leukotrienes result from the action of 5lipoxygenase on arachidonic acid and are synthesized by a variety of inflammatory cells in the airways, including eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages, and basophils. Leukotriene $\mathrm{B}_{4}$ ( $\mathrm{LTB}_{4}$ ) is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, and $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$ exert many effects known to occur in asthma, including bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial reactivity, mucosal edema, and mucus hypersecretion. Early studies established that antigen challenge of sensitized human lung tissue results in the generation of leukotrienes, whereas other studies of human subjects have shown that inhalation of leukotrienes causes not only bronchoconstriction but also an increase in bronchial reactivity to histamine that persists for several days.

Two approaches to interrupting the leukotriene pathway have been pursued: inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase, thereby preventing leukotriene synthesis; and inhibition of the binding of $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$ to its receptor on target tissues, thereby preventing its action. Efficacy in blocking airway responses to exercise and to antigen challenge has been shown for drugs in both categories: zileuton, a 5 -lipoxygenase inhibitor, and zafirlukast and montelukast, $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$-receptor antagonists. All have been shown to improve asthma control and to reduce the frequency of asthma exacerbations in outpatient clinical trials. Their effects on symptoms, airway caliber, bronchial reactivity, and airway inflammation are less marked than the effects of inhaled corticosteroids, but they are more nearly equal in reducing the frequency of exacerbations. Their principal advantage is that they are taken orally; some patients-especially children-comply poorly with inhaled therapies. Montelukast is approved for children as young as 6 years of age.

Zileuton

Some patients appear to have particularly favorable responses, but no clinical features allow identification of "responders" before a trial of therapy. In the USA, zileuton is approved for use in an oral dosage of $400-800 \mathrm{mg}$ for administration 2-4 times daily; zafirlukast, 20 mg twice daily; and montelukast, 10 mg (for adults) or 4 mg (for children) once daily.

Trials with leukotriene inhibitors have demonstrated an important role for leukotrienes in aspirin-induced asthma. It has long been known that $5-10 \%$ of asthmatics are exquisitely sensitive to aspirin, so that ingestion of even a very small dose causes profound bronchoconstriction and symptoms of systemic release of histamine, such as flushing and abdominal cramping. Because this reaction to aspirin is not associated with any evidence of allergic sensitization to aspirin or its metabolites and because it is produced by any of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, it is thought to result from inhibition of prostaglandin synthetase (cyclooxygenase), shifting arachidonic acid metabolism from the prostaglandin to the leukotriene pathway. Support for this idea was provided by the demonstration that leukotriene pathway inhibitors impressively reduce the response to aspirin challenge and improve overall control of asthma on a day-to-day basis.

Of these agents, zileuton is the least prescribed because of the former requirement of four-times-daily dosing (a formulation for twice-daily use has recently been developed) and because of occasional liver toxicity. The receptor antagonists appear to be safe to use. Reports of Churg-Strauss syndrome (a systemic vasculitis accompanied by worsening asthma, pulmonary infiltrates, and eosinophilia) appear to have been coincidental, with the syndrome unmasked by the reduction in prednisone dosage made possible by the addition of zafirlukast or montelukast.

\section*{OTHER DRUGS IN THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA}

\section*{Anti-I gE Monoclonal Antibodies}

An entirely new approach to the treatment of asthma exploits advances in molecular biology to target IgE antibody. From a collection of monoclonal antibodies raised in mice against IgE antibody itself, a monoclonal antibody was selected that appeared to be targeted against the portion of IgE that binds to its receptors (FCe-R1 and FCe-R2 receptors) on mast cells and other inflammatory cells. Omalizumab (an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody) inhibits the binding of IgE to mast cells but does not activate IgE already bound to these cells and thus does not provoke mast cell degranulation. It may also inhibit IgE synthesis by B lymphocytes. The murine antibody has been genetically humanized by replacing all but a small fraction of its amino acids with those found in human proteins, and it does not appear to cause sensitization when given to human subjects.

Studies of omalizumab in asthmatic volunteers showed that its administration over 10 weeks lowered plasma IgE to undetectable levels and significantly reduced the magnitude of both the early and the late bronchospastic responses to antigen challenge. Clinical trials have shown that repeated intravenous or subcutaneous injection of anti-IgE MAb lessens asthma severity and reduces the corticosteroid requirement in patients with moderate to severe disease, especially those with a clear environmental antigen precipitating factor, and improves nasal and conjunctival symptoms in patients with perennial or seasonal allergic rhinitis. Omalizumab's most important effect is reduction of the frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations, even while enabling a reduction in corticosteroid requirements. Combined analysis of several clinical trials has shown that the patients most likely to respond are, fortunately, those with the greatest need, ie, patients with a history of repeated exacerbations, a high requirement for corticosteroid treatment, and poor pulmonary function. Similarly, the exacerbations most prevented are the ones most important to prevent: Omalizumab treatment reduced exacerbations requiring hospitalization by $88 \%$. These benefits justify the high cost of this treatment in selected individuals with severe disease characterized by frequent exacerbations.

\section*{Possible Future Therapies}

The rapid advance in the scientific description of the immunopathogenesis of asthma has spurred the development of many new therapies targeting different sites in the immune cascade. These include monoclonal antibodies directed against cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13), antagonists of cell adhesion molecules, protease inhibitors, and immunomodulators aimed at shifting CD4 lymphocytes from the T н 2 to the TH1 phenotype or at selective inhibition of the subset of Th2 lymphocytes directed against particular antigens. There is evidence that asthma may be aggravated-or even caused-by chronic airway infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This may explain the reports of benefit from treatment with macrolide antibiotics and, if confirmed, would stimulate the development of new diagnostic methods and antimicrobial therapies.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF DRUGS USED I N THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA}

Asthma is best thought of as a disease in two time domains. In the present domain, it is important for the distress it causes-cough, nocturnal awakenings, and shortness of breath that interferes with the ability to exercise or to pursue desired activities. For mild asthma, occasional inhalation of a bronchodilator may be
all that is needed. For more severe asthma, treatment with a long-term controller, like an inhaled corticosteroid, is necessary to relieve symptoms and restore function. The second domain of asthma is the risk it presents of future events, such as exacerbations, or of progressive loss of pulmonary function. A patient's satisfaction with his or her ability to control symptoms and maintain function by frequent use of an inhaled $B_{2}$ agonist does not mean that the risk of future events is also controlled. In fact, use of two or more canisters of an inhaled Bagonist per month is a marker of increased risk of asthma fatality.

The challenges of assessing severity and adjusting therapy for these two domains of asthma are different. For relief of distress in the present domain, the key information can be obtained by asking specific questions about the frequency and severity of symptoms, the frequency of use of an inhaled $B_{2}$ agonist for relief of symptoms, the frequency of nocturnal awakenings, and the ability to exercise. Estimating the risk for future exacerbations is more difficult. In general, patients with poorly controlled symptoms in the present have a heightened risk of exacerbations in the future, but some patients seem unaware of the severity of their underlying airflow obstruction (sometimes described as "poor perceivers") and can be identified only by measurement of pulmonary function, as by spirometry. Reductions in the FEV ${ }_{1}$ correlate with heightened risk of attacks of asthma in the future. Other possible markers of heightened risk are unstable pulmonary function (large variations in FEV ${ }_{1}$ from visit to visit, large change with bronchodilator treatment), extreme bronchial reactivity, or high numbers of eosinophils in sputum or of nitric oxide in exhaled air. Assessment of these features may identify patients who need increases in therapy for protection against exacerbations.

\section*{BRONCHODI LATORS}

Bronchodilators, such as inhaled albuterol, are rapidly effective, safe, and inexpensive. Patients with only occasional symptoms of asthma require no more than an inhaled $B_{2}$-receptor agonist taken on an asneeded basis. If symptoms require this "rescue" therapy more than twice a week, if nocturnal symptoms occur more than twice a month, or if the $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ is less than $80 \%$ predicted, additional treatment is needed. The treatment first recommended is a low dose of an inhaled corticosteroid, although treatment with a leukotriene receptor antagonist or with cromolyn may be used. Theophylline is now largely reserved for patients in whom symptoms remain poorly controlled despite the combination of regular treatment with an inhaled anti-inflammatory agent and as-needed use of a $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ agonist. If the addition of theophylline fails to improve symptoms or if adverse effects become bothersome, it is important to check the plasma level of theophylline to be sure it is in the therapeutic range ( $10-20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ ).

An important caveat for patients with mild asthma is that although the risk of a severe, life-threatening attack is lower than in patients with severe asthma, it is not zero. All patients with asthma should be instructed in a simple action plan for severe, frightening attacks: to take up to four puffs of albuterol every 20 minutes over 1 hour. If they do not note clear improvement after the first four puffs, they should take the additional treatments while on their way to an Emergency Department or some other higher level of care.

\section*{MUSCARI NI C ANTAGONI STS}

Inhaled muscarinic antagonists have so far earned a limited place in the treatment of asthma. When adequate doses are given, their effect on baseline airway resistance is nearly as great as that of the sympathomimetic drugs. The airway effects of antimuscarinic and sympathomimetic drugs given in full doses have been shown to be additive only in patients with severe airflow obstruction who present for
emergency care. Antimuscarinic agents appear to be of greater value in COPD-perhaps more so than in asthma. They are also useful as alternative therapies for patients intolerant of $\mathrm{B}_{2}$-adrenoceptor agonists.

Although it was predicted that muscarinic antagonists would dry airway secretions and interfere with mucociliary clearance, direct measurements of fluid volume secretion from single airway submucosal glands in animals show that atropine decreases baseline secretory rates only slightly. The drugs do, however, inhibit the increase in mucus secretion caused by vagal stimulation. No cases of inspissation of mucus have been reported following administration of these drugs.

\section*{CORTI COSTEROI DS}

If asthmatic symptoms occur frequently or if significant airflow obstruction persists despite bronchodilator therapy, inhaled corticosteroids should be started. For patients with severe symptoms or severe airflow obstruction (eg, $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}<50 \%$ predicted), initial treatment with a combination of inhaled and oral corticosteroid (eg, $30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ of prednisone for 3 weeks) treatment is appropriate. Once clinical improvement is noted, usually after 7-10 days, the oral dose should be discontinued or reduced to the minimum necessary to control symptoms.

An issue for inhaled corticosteroid treatment is patient compliance. Analysis of prescription renewals shows that corticosteroids are taken regularly by a minority of patients. This may be a function of a general "steroid phobia" fostered by emphasis in the lay press over the hazards of long-term oral corticosteroid therapy and by ignorance over the difference between corticosteroids and anabolic steroids, taken to enhance muscle strength by now-infamous athletes. This fear of corticosteroid toxicity makes it hard to persuade patients whose symptoms have improved after starting the treatment that they should continue it for protection against attacks. This context accounts for the interest in a recent report that instructing patients with mild but persistent asthma to initiate inhaled corticosteroid therapy only when their symptoms worsened was as effective in maintaining pulmonary function and preventing attacks as taking it twice each day.

In patients with more severe asthma, whose symptoms are inadequately controlled by a standard dose of an inhaled corticosteroid, two options may be considered: to double the dose of inhaled corticosteroid or to add a long-acting inhaled $\mathrm{B}_{2}$-receptor agonist (salmeterol or formoterol). Many studies have shown this combination therapy to be more effective than doubling the dose of the inhaled corticosteroid, but the FDA has issued a warning that the use of a long-acting Bagonist is associated with a very small but statistically significant increase in the risk of death or near death from an asthma attack, especially in African Americans. This warning has not so far had much effect on prescriptions for a fixed-dose combination of inhaled fluticasone (a corticosteroid) and salmeterol (a long-acting Bagonist), probably because their combination in a single inhaler offers several advantages. Combination inhalers are convenient; they ensure that the long-acting Bagonist will not be taken as monotherapy (known not to protect against attacks); and they produce prompt, sustained improvements in clinical symptoms and pulmonary function and reduce the frequency of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroid treatment. In patients prescribed such combination treatment, it is important to provide explicit instructions that a standard, short-acting inhaled $B_{2}$ agonist, such as albuterol, be used as needed for relief of acute symptoms.

\section*{CROMOLYN \& NEDOCROMI L; LEUKOTRI ENE ANTAGONI STS}

Cromolyn or nedocromil by inhalation, or a leukotriene-receptor antagonist as an oral tablet, may be considered as alternatives to inhaled corticosteroid treatment in patients with symptoms occurring more
than twice a week or who are wakened from sleep by asthma more than twice a month. Neither treatment is as effective as even a low dose of an inhaled corticosteroid, but both prevent the issue of "steroid phobia" described above.

Cromolyn and nedocromil may also be useful in patients whose symptoms occur seasonally or after clearcut inciting stimuli such as exercise or exposure to animal danders or irritants. In patients whose symptoms are continuous or occur without an obvious inciting stimulus, the value of these drugs can be established only with a therapeutic trial of inhaled drug four times a day for 4 weeks. If the patient responds to this therapy, the dose can then be optimized.

Treatment with a leukotriene-receptor antagonist, particularly montelukast, is widely prescribed, especially by primary care providers. Taken orally, leukotriene-receptor antagonists are easy to use and appear to be taken more regularly than inhaled corticosteroids. They are rarely associated with troublesome side effects. Maintenance therapy with a leukotriene antagonist or with cromolyn or nedocromil appears to be roughly as effective as maintenance therapy with theophylline. Because of concerns over the possible long-term toxicity of systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, this maintenance therapy has become widely used for treating children in the USA.

\section*{ANTI-I GE MONOCLONAL ANTI BODY}

Treatment with omalizumab, the monoclonal humanized anti-IgE antibody, is reserved for patients with chronic severe asthma inadequately controlled by high-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting $B$ agonist combination treatment (eg, fluticasone 500 mcg plus salmeterol 50 mcg inhaled twice daily). This treatment reduces lymphocytic, eosinophilic bronchial inflammation and effectively reduces the frequency and severity of exacerbations. It is reserved for patients with demonstrated IgE-mediated sensitivity (by positive skin test or radioallergosorbent test [RAST] to common allergens) and an IgE level within a range that can be reduced sufficiently by twice weekly subcutaneous injection.

\section*{OTHER ANTI-I NFLAMMATORY THERAPIES}

Some reports suggest that agents commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis may also be used to treat patients with chronic steroid-dependent asthma. The development of an alternative treatment is important, because chronic treatment with oral corticosteroids may cause osteoporosis, cataracts, glucose intolerance, worsening of hypertension, and cushingoid changes in appearance. Initial studies suggested that oral methotrexate or gold salt injections were beneficial in prednisone-dependent asthmatics, but subsequent studies did not confirm this promise. In contrast, the benefit from treatment with cyclosporine seems real. However, this drug's great toxicity makes this finding only a source of hope that other immunomodulatory therapies will ultimately be developed for the small proportion of patients whose asthma can be managed only with high oral doses of prednisone. An immunomodulatory therapy recently reported to improve asthma is injection of etanercept, a TNF-a. antagonist used for treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and severe rheumatoid arthritis.

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ASTHMA}

The treatment of acute attacks of asthma in patients reporting to the hospital requires close, continuous clinical assessment and repeated objective measurement of lung function. For patients with mild attacks, inhalation of a $B_{2}$-receptor agonist is as effective as subcutaneous injection of epinephrine. Both of these treatments are more effective than intravenous administration of aminophylline (a soluble salt of
theophylline). Severe attacks require treatment with oxygen, frequent or continuous administration of aerosolized albuterol, and systemic treatment with prednisone or methylprednisolone ( $0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ every 6 hours). Even this aggressive treatment is not invariably effective, and patients must be watched closely for signs of deterioration. General anesthesia, intubation, and mechanical ventilation of asthmatic patients cannot be undertaken lightly but may be lifesaving if respiratory failure supervenes.

\section*{PROSPECTS FOR PREVENTION}

The high prevalence of asthma in the developed world and its rapid increases in the developing world call for a strategy for primary prevention. Strict antigen avoidance during infancy, once thought to be sensible, has now been shown to be ineffective. In fact, growing up in a household where cats and dogs are kept as pets may protect against developing asthma. The best hope seems to lie in understanding the importance of microbial exposures during infancy in shaping a balanced immune response, and one study showing that feeding Lactobacillus caseii to infants born to allergic parents reduced the rate of allergic dermatitis at age 2 years offers reason for hope.
