                    <p>Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular disease. In a survey carried out in 2000, hypertension was found in 28% of American adults. According to a Framingham study of blood pressure trends in middle-aged and older individuals, approximately 90% of Caucasian Americans will develop hypertension in their lifetime. The prevalence varies with age, race, education, and many other variables. Sustained arterial hypertension damages blood vessels in kidney, heart, and brain and leads to an increased incidence of renal failure, coronary disease, cardiac failure, and stroke. Effective pharmacologic lowering of blood pressure has been shown to prevent damage to blood vessels and to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality rates. Unfortunately, several surveys indicate that only one third of Americans with hypertension have adequate blood pressure control. Many effective drugs are available. Knowledge of their antihypertensive mechanisms and sites of action allows accurate prediction of efficacy and toxicity. As a result, rational use of these agents, alone or in combination, can lower blood pressure with minimal risk of serious toxicity in most patients.</p>

                                     <p>The diagnosis of hypertension is based on repeated, reproducible measurements of elevated blood pressure. The diagnosis serves primarily as a prediction of consequences for the patient; it seldom includes a statement about the cause of hypertension.</p>
                                    <p>Epidemiologic studies indicate that the risks of damage to kidney, heart, and brain are directly related to the extent of blood pressure elevation. Even mild hypertension (blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg) increases the risk of eventual end organ damage. Starting at 115/75 mm Hg cardiovascular disease risk doubles with each increment of 20/10 mm Hg throughout the blood pressure range. The risks‚Äîand therefore the urgency of instituting therapy‚Äîincrease in proportion to the magnitude of blood pressure elevation. The risk of end organ damage at any level of blood pressure or age is greater in African-Americans and relatively less in premenopausal women than in men. Other positive risk factors include smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, manifestations of end organ damage at the time of diagnosis, and a family history of cardiovascular disease.</p>
                                    <p>It should be noted that the diagnosis of hypertension depends on measurement of blood pressure and not on symptoms reported by the patient. In fact, hypertension is usually asymptomatic until overt end organ damage is imminent or has already occurred.</p>

                                     <p>A specific cause of hypertension can be established in only 10-15% of patients. It is important to consider specific causes in each case, however, because some of them are amenable to definitive surgical treatment: renal artery constriction, coarctation of the aorta, pheochromocytoma, Cushing's disease, and primary aldosteronism.</p>
                                    <p>Patients in whom no specific cause of hypertension can be found are said to have essential hypertension. *
                                        In most cases, elevated blood pressure is associated with an overall increase in resistance to flow of blood through arterioles, while cardiac output is usually normal. Meticulous investigation of autonomic nervous system function, baroreceptor reflexes, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and the kidney has failed to identify a primary abnormality as the cause of increased peripheral vascular resistance in essential
                                        hypertension.</p>
                                    <p>Elevated blood pressure is usually caused by a combination of several (multifactorial) abnormalities. Epidemiologic evidence points to genetic inheritance, psychological stress, and environmental and dietary factors (increased salt and decreased potassium or calcium intake) as perhaps contributing to the development of hypertension. Increase in blood pressure with aging does not occur in populations with low daily sodium intake. Patients with labile hypertension appear more likely than normal controls to have blood pressure elevations after salt loading.</p>
                                    <p>The heritability of essential hypertension is estimated to be about 30%. Mutations in several genes have been linked to various rare causes of hypertension. Functional variations of the genes for angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the $B_{2}$ adrenoceptor, and adducin (a cytoskeletal protein) appear to contribute to some cases of essential hypertension.</p>
                                    <p>*The adjective originally was intended to convey the now abandoned idea that blood pressure elevation was essential for adequate perfusion of diseased tissues.</p>

                                    <p>Physiologically, in both normal and hypertensive individuals, blood pressure is maintained by moment-to-moment regulation of cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance, exerted at three anatomic sites (Figure 11-1): arterioles, postcapillary venules (capacitance vessels), and heart. A fourth anatomic control site, the kidney, contributes to maintenance of blood pressure by regulating the volume of intravascular fluid. Baroreflexes, mediated by autonomic nerves, act in combination with humoral mechanisms, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, to coordinate function at these four control sites and to maintain normal blood pressure. Finally, local release of vasoactive substances from vascular endothelium may also be involved in the regulation of vascular resistance. For example, endothelin-1 (see Chapter 17) constricts and nitric oxide (see Chapter 19) dilates blood vessels.</p>

                                    <p>(Figure 11-2) Baroreflexes are responsible for rapid, moment-to-moment adjustments in blood pressure, such as in transition from a reclining to an upright posture. Central sympathetic neurons arising from the vasomotor area of the medulla are tonically active. Carotid baroreceptors are stimulated by the stretch of the vessel walls brought about by the internal pressure (arterial blood pressure). Baroreceptor activation inhibits central sympathetic discharge. Conversely, reduction in stretch results in a reduction in baroreceptor activity. Thus, in the case of a transition to upright posture, baroreceptors sense the reduction in arterial pressure that results from pooling of blood in the veins below the level of the heart as reduced wall stretch, and sympathetic discharge is disinhibited. The reflex increase in sympathetic outflow acts through nerve endings to increase peripheral vascular resistance (constriction of arterioles) and cardiac output (direct stimulation of the heart and constriction of capacitance vessels, which increases venous return to the heart), thereby restoring normal blood pressure. The same baroreflex acts in response to any event that lowers arterial pressure, including a primary reduction in peripheral vascular resistance (eg, caused by a vasodilating agent) or a reduction in intravascular volume (eg, due to hemorrhage or to loss of salt and water via the kidney).</p>

                                     <p>By controlling blood volume, the kidney is primarily responsible for long-term blood pressure control. A reduction in renal perfusion pressure causes intrarenal redistribution of blood flow and increased reabsorption of salt and water. In addition, decreased pressure in renal arterioles as well as sympathetic neural activity (via Badrenoceptors) stimulates production of renin, which increases production of angiotensin II (see Figure 11-1 and Chapter 17). Angiotensin II causes (1) direct constriction of resistance vessels and (2) stimulation of aldosterone synthesis in the adrenal cortex, which increases renal sodium absorption and intravascular blood volume. Vasopressin released from the posterior pituitary gland also plays a role in maintenance of blood pressure through its ability to regulate water reabsorption by the kidney (see Chapters 15 and 17).</p>

                             <p>Monotherapy of hypertension (treatment with a single drug) is desirable because compliance is likely to be better, cost is lower, and because in some cases adverse effects are fewer. However, most patients with hypertension require two or more drugs, each acting by a different mechanism (polypharmacy). The rationale for polypharmacy is that each of the drugs acts on one of a set of interacting, mutually compensatory regulatory mechanisms for maintaining blood pressure (see Figures 6-7 and 11-1).</p>
                            <p>For example, because an adequate dose of hydralazine causes a significant decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, there will initially be a drop in mean arterial blood pressure, evoking a strong response in the form of compensatory tachycardia and salt and water retention (Figure 11-4). The result is an increase in cardiac output that is capable of almost completely reversing the effect of hydralazine. The addition of a Bblocker prevents the tachycardia; addition of a diuretic (eg, hydrochlorothiazide) prevents the salt and water retention. In effect, all three drugs increase the sensitivity of the cardiovascular system to each other's actions. Thus, partial impairment of one regulatory mechanism (sympathetic discharge to the heart) increases the antihypertensive effect of impairing regulation by another mechanism (peripheral vascular resistance). Finally, in some circumstances, a normal compensatory response accounts for the toxicity of an antihypertensive agent, and the toxic effect can be prevented by administering a second type of drug. In the case of hydralazine, compensatory tachycardia and increased cardiac output may precipitate angina in patients with coronary atherosclerosis. Addition of the Bblocker and diuretic can prevent this toxicity in many patients.</p>

Compensatory responses to vasodilators; basis for combination therapy with beta-blockers and diuretics.

Increased Renin Release leads to Increased Angiotensin II and Aldosterone, causing Salt and Water Retention (blocked by diuretics) and Increased Blood Volume." class="content-image">

                             <p>In practice, when hypertension does not respond adequately to a regimen of one drug, a second drug from a different class with a different mechanism of action and different pattern of toxicity is added. If the response is still inadequate and compliance is known to be good, a third drug may be added. The drugs least likely to be successful as monotherapy are the vasodilators hydralazine and minoxidil. It is not completely clear why other vasodilators such as calcium channel blockers cause less marked compensatory responses for the same amount of blood pressure lowering.</p>

                             <p>Dietary sodium restriction has been known for many years to decrease blood pressure in hypertensive patients. With the advent of diuretics, sodium restriction was thought to be less important. However, there is now general agreement that dietary control of blood pressure is a relatively nontoxic therapeutic measure and may even be preventive. Several studies have shown that even modest dietary sodium restriction lowers blood pressure (although to varying extents) in many hypertensive individuals.</p>

                             <p>Diuretics lower blood pressure primarily by depleting body sodium stores. Initially, diuretics reduce blood pressure by reducing blood volume and cardiac output; peripheral vascular resistance may increase. After 6-8 weeks, cardiac output returns toward normal while peripheral vascular resistance declines. Sodium is believed to contribute to vascular resistance by increasing vessel stiffness and neural reactivity, possibly related to increased sodium-calcium exchange with a resultant increase in intracellular calcium.</p>
                            <p>Some diuretics have direct vasodilating effects in addition to their diuretic action. Indapamide is a nonthiazide sulfonamide diuretic with both diuretic and vasodilator activity. As a consequence of vasodilation, cardiac output remains unchanged or increases slightly. Amiloride inhibits smooth muscle responses to contractile stimuli, probably through effects on transmembrane and intracellular calcium movement that are independent of its action on sodium excretion.</p>
                            <p>Diuretics are effective in lowering blood pressure by 10-15 mm Hg in most patients, and diuretics alone often provide adequate treatment for mild or moderate essential hypertension. In more severe hypertension, diuretics are used in combination with sympathoplegic and vasodilator drugs to control the tendency toward sodium retention caused by these agents. Vascular responsiveness‚Äîie, the ability to either constrict or dilate‚Äîis diminished by sympathoplegic and vasodilator drugs, so that the vasculature behaves like an inflexible tube. As a consequence, blood pressure becomes exquisitely sensitive to blood volume. Thus, in severe hypertension, when multiple drugs are used, blood pressure may be well controlled when blood volume is 95% of normal but much too high when blood volume is 105% of normal.</p>

                             <p>The sites of action within the kidney and the pharmacokinetics of various diuretic drugs are discussed in Chapter 15. Thiazide diuretics are appropriate for most patients with mild or moderate hypertension and normal renal and cardiac function. More powerful diuretics (eg, those acting on the loop of Henle) are necessary in severe hypertension, when multiple drugs with sodium-retaining properties are used; in renal insufficiency, when glomerular filtration rate is less than 30 or 40 mL/min; and in cardiac failure or cirrhosis, where sodium retention is marked.</p>
                            <p>Potassium-sparing diuretics are useful both to avoid excessive potassium depletion, particularly in patients taking digitalis, and to enhance the natriuretic effects of other diuretics. Aldosterone receptor antagonists in particular also have a favorable effect on cardiac function in people with heart failure.</p>
                            <p>Some pharmacokinetic characteristics and the initial and usual maintenance dosages of hydrochlorothiazide are listed in Table 11-1. Although thiazide diuretics are more natriuretic at higher doses (up to 100-200 mg of hydrochlorothiazide), when used as a single agent, lower doses (25-50 mg) exert as much antihypertensive effect as do higher doses. In contrast to thiazides, the blood pressure response to loop diuretics continues to increase at doses many times greater than the usual therapeutic dose.</p>

                            <p>In the treatment of hypertension, the most common adverse effect of diuretics (except for potassium-sparing diuretics) is potassium depletion. Although mild degrees of hypokalemia are tolerated well by many patients, hypokalemia may be hazardous in persons taking digitalis, those who have chronic arrhythmias, or those with acute myocardial infarction or left ventricular dysfunction. Potassium loss is coupled to reabsorption of
                                sodium, and restriction of dietary sodium intake will therefore minimize potassium loss. Diuretics may also cause magnesium depletion, impair glucose tolerance, and increase serum lipid concentrations. Diuretics increase uric acid concentrations and may precipitate gout. The use of low doses minimizes these adverse metabolic effects without impairing the antihypertensive action. Several case-control studies have reported a small but significant excess risk of renal cell carcinoma associated with diuretic use. Potassium-sparing diuretics may produce hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency and those taking ACE inhibitors or angiotension receptor blockers; spironolactone (a steroid) is associated with gynecomastia.</p>

                             <p>In patients with moderate to severe hypertension, most effective drug regimens include an agent that inhibits function of the sympathetic nervous system. Drugs in this group are classified according to the site at which they impair the sympathetic reflex arc (Figure 11-2). This neuroanatomic classification explains prominent differences in cardiovascular effects of drugs and allows the clinician to predict interactions of these drugs with one another and with other drugs.</p>
                            <p>Most importantly, the subclasses of drugs exhibit different patterns of potential toxicity. Drugs that lower blood pressure by actions on the central nervous system tend to cause sedation and mental depression and may produce disturbances of sleep, including nightmares. Drugs that act by inhibiting transmission through autonomic ganglia produce toxicity from inhibition of parasympathetic regulation, in addition to profound sympathetic blockade. Drugs that act chiefly by reducing release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve endings cause effects that are similar to those of surgical sympathectomy, including inhibition of ejaculation, and hypotension that is increased by upright posture and after exercise. Drugs that block postsynaptic adrenoceptors produce a more selective spectrum of effects depending on the class of receptor to which they bind.</p>
                            <p>Finally, one should note that all of the agents that lower blood pressure by altering sympathetic function can elicit compensatory effects through mechanisms that are not dependent on adrenergic nerves. Thus, the antihypertensive effect of any of these agents used alone may be limited by retention of sodium by the kidney and expansion of blood volume. For these reasons, sympathoplegic antihypertensive drugs are most effective when used concomitantly with a diuretic.</p>

                                     <p>These agents reduce sympathetic outflow from vasopressor centers in the brainstem but allow these centers to retain or even increase their sensitivity to baroreceptor control. Accordingly, the antihypertensive and toxic actions of these drugs are generally less dependent on posture than are the effects of drugs that act directly on peripheral sympathetic neurons.</p>
                                    <p>Methyldopa ( L-a-methyl-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) is an analog of L-dopa and is converted to a.methyldopamine and $\alpha$-methylnorepinephrine; this pathway directly parallels the synthesis of norepinephrine from dopa illustrated in Figure 6-5. Alpha-methylnorepinephrine is stored in adrenergic nerve vesicles, where it stoichiometrically replaces norepinephrine, and is released by nerve stimulation to interact with postsynaptic adrenoceptors. However, this replacement of norepinephrine by a false transmitter in peripheral neurons is not responsible for methyldopa's antihypertensive effect, because the a-methylnorepinephrine released is an effective agonist at the cadrenoceptors that mediate peripheral sympathetic constriction of
                                         arterioles and venules.</p>
                                    <p>In fact, methyldopa's antihypertensive action appears to be due to stimulation of central a cadrenoceptors by -methylnorepinephrine or a-methyldopamine, based on the following evidence: (1) Much lower doses of methyldopa are required to lower blood pressure in animals when the drug is administered centrally by injection into the cerebral ventricles rather than intravenously. (2) Alpha-receptor antagonists, especially $\omega_{2}$ selective antagonists, administered centrally, block the antihypertensive effect of methyldopa, whether the latter is given centrally or intravenously. (3) Potent inhibitors of dopa decarboxylase, administered centrally, block methyldopa's antihypertensive effect, thus showing that metabolism of the parent drug in the central nervous system is necessary for its action.</p>
                                    <p>The antihypertensive action of clonidine, a 2-imidazoline derivative, was discovered in the course of testing the drug for use as a topically applied nasal decongestant.</p>
                                    <p>After intravenous injection, clonidine produces a brief rise in blood pressure followed by more prolonged hypotension. The pressor response is due to direct stimulation of adrenoceptors in arterioles. The drug is classified as a partial agonist at areceptors because it also inhibits pressor effects of other a.agonists.</p>
                                    <p>Considerable evidence indicates that the hypotensive effect of clonidine is exerted at adrenoceptors in the medulla of the brain. In animals, the hypotensive effect of clonidine is prevented by central administration of a.antagonists. Clonidine reduces sympathetic and increases parasympathetic tone, resulting in blood pressure lowering and bradycardia. The reduction in pressure is accompanied by a decrease in circulating catecholamine levels. These observations suggest that clonidine sensitizes brainstem pressor centers to inhibition by baroreflexes.</p>
                                    <p>Thus, studies of clonidine and methyldopa suggest that normal regulation of blood pressure involves central adrenergic neurons that modulate baroreceptor reflexes. Clonidine and a.-methylnorepinephrine bind more tightly to $\alpha_{2}$ than to $\alpha_{1}$ adrenoceptors. As noted in Chapter 6, $\alpha_{2}$ receptors are located on presynaptic adrenergic neurons as well as some postsynaptic sites. It is possible that clonidine and a.methylnorepinephrine act in the brain to reduce norepinephrine release onto relevant receptor sites. Alternatively, these drugs may act on postsynaptic 2 adrenoceptors to inhibit activity of appropriate neurons. Finally, clonidine also binds to a nonadrenoceptor site, the imidazoline receptor, which may also mediate antihypertensive effects.</p>
                                    <p>Methyldopa and clonidine produce slightly different hemodynamic effects: clonidine lowers heart rate and cardiac output more than does methyldopa. This difference suggests that these two drugs do not have identical sites of action. They may act primarily on different populations of neurons in the vasomotor centers of the brainstem.</p>

                                                     <p>Guanethidine inhibits the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve endings (see Figure 6-4). This effect is probably responsible for most of the sympathoplegia that occurs in patients. Guanethidine is transported across the sympathetic nerve membrane by the same mechanism that transports norepinephrine itself (NET, uptake 1), and uptake is essential for the drug's action. Once guanethidine has entered the nerve, it is concentrated in transmitter vesicles, where it replaces norepinephrine. Because it replaces norepinephrine, the drug causes a gradual depletion of norepinephrine stores in the nerve ending.</p>
                                                    <p>Inhibition of norepinephrine release is probably caused by guanethidine's local anesthetic properties on sympathetic nerve terminals. Although the drug does not impair axonal conduction in sympathetic fibers, local blockade of membrane electrical activity may occur in nerve endings because the nerve endings specifically take up and concentrate the drug.</p>
                                                    <p>Because neuronal uptake is necessary for the hypotensive activity of guanethidine, drugs that block the catecholamine uptake process or displace amines from the nerve terminal (see Chapter 6) block its effects.

                                                     <p>Reserpine blocks the ability of aminergic transmitter vesicles to take up and store biogenic amines, probably by interfering with the vesicular membrane-associated transporter (VMAT, see Figure 6-4). This effect occurs throughout the body, resulting in depletion of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin in both central and peripheral neurons. Chromaffin granules of the adrenal medulla are also depleted of catecholamines, although to a lesser extent than are the vesicles of neurons. Reserpine's effects on adrenergic vesicles appear irreversible; trace amounts of the drug remain bound to vesicular membranes for many days. Although sufficiently high doses of reserpine in animals can reduce catecholamine stores to zero, lower doses cause inhibition of neurotransmission that is roughly proportionate to the degree of amine depletion.</p>
                                                    <p>Depletion of peripheral amines probably accounts for much of the beneficial antihypertensive effect of reserpine, but a central component cannot be ruled out. The effects of low but clinically effective doses resemble those of centrally acting agents (eg, methyldopa) in that sympathetic reflexes remain largely intact, blood pressure is reduced in supine as well as in standing patients, and postural hypotension is mild. Reserpine readily enters the brain, and depletion of cerebral amine stores causes sedation, mental depression, and parkinsonism symptoms.</p>
                                                    <p>At lower doses used for treatment of mild hypertension, reserpine lowers blood pressure by a combination of decreased cardiac output and decreased peripheral vascular resistance.</p>

Although metoprolol is in other respects very similar to propranolol, its relative cardioselectivity may be advantageous in treating hypertensive patients who also suffer from asthma, diabetes, or peripheral vascular disease. Studies of small numbers of asthmatic patients have shown that metoprolol causes less bronchial constriction than propranolol at doses that produce equal inhibition of $B_{1}$ adrenoceptor responses. The cardioselectivity is not complete, however, and asthmatic symptoms have been exacerbated by metoprolol. See Table 11-1.</p>

They lower blood pressure by decreasing vascular resistance and appear to depress cardiac output or heart rate less than other Bblockers, perhaps because of significantly greater agonist than antagonist effects at $B_{2}$ receptors. This may be particularly beneficial for patients with bradyarrhythmias or peripheral vascular disease. Daily doses of pindolol start at 10 mg ; of acebutolol, at 400 mg ; and of penbutolol, at 20 mg .</p>
                                                    <p>They are effective in the major cardiovascular applications of the B-blocking group (hypertension and angina). Although these partial agonists may be less likely to cause bradycardia and abnormalities in plasma lipids than are antagonists, the overall clinical significance of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity remains uncertain. Pindolo perhaps as a result of actions on serotonin signaling, may potentiate the action of traditional antidepressant medications. Celiprolol is a $B_{1}$-selective antagonist with a modest capacity to activate $B_{2}$ receptors.</p>

                                                     <p>Labetalol is formulated as a racemic mixture of four isomers (it has two centers of asymmetry). Two of these isomers‚Äîthe ( $S, S$ ) - and ( $R, S$ ) -isomers‚Äîare relatively inactive, a third ( $S, R$ ) - is a potent ablocker, and the last ( $R, R$ ) - is a potent Bblocker. The B-blocking isomer is thought to have selective $B_{2}$ agonist and nonselective Bantagonist action. Labetalol has a 3:1 ratio of B:c. antagonism after oral dosing. Blood pressure is lowered by reduction of systemic vascular resistance without significant alteration in heart rate or cardiac output. Because of its combined and b-blocking activity, labetalol is useful in treating the hypertension of pheochromocytoma and hypertensive emergencies. Oral daily doses of labetalol range from 200 to 2400 $\mathrm{mg}/ \mathrm{d}$. Labetalol is given as repeated intravenous bolus injections of 20-80 mg to treat hypertensive emergencies.</p>

                                                    <p>Carvedilol antagonizes the actions of catecholamines more potently at Breceptors than at areceptors. The drug has a half-life of 6-8 hours. It is extensively metabolized in the liver, and stereoselective metabolism of its two isomers is observed. Since metabolism of (R)- carvedilol is influenced by polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 2D6 activity and by drugs that inhibit this enzyme's activity (such as quinidine and fluoxetine), drug interaction: may occur. Carvedilol also appears to attenuate oxygen free radical-initiated lipid peroxidation and to inhibit vascular smooth muscle mitogenesis independently of adrenoceptor blockade. These effects may contribute to the clinical benefits of the drug in chronic heart failure (see Chapter 13).</p>

                                     <p>Volatile anesthetics are rarely used as the sole agents for both induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Most commonly, they are combined with intravenous agents as part of a balanced anesthesia technique. Of the inhaled anesthetics, nitrous oxide, desflurane, sevoflurane, and isoflurane are the most commonly used in the USA. Use of less soluble volatile anesthetics (especially desflurane and sevoflurane) has increased during the last decade as more surgical procedures are performed on an ambulatory ("short-stay") basis. The low blood: gas coefficients of desflurane and sevoflurane afford a more rapid recovery and fewer postoperative adverse effects than halothane, enflurane, and
                                         isoflurane. Although halothane is still used in pediatric anesthesia, sevoflurane is rapidly replacing halothane in this setting. As indicated previously, nitrous oxide lacks sufficient potency to produce surgical anesthesia by itself and therefore is used with volatile or intravenous anesthetics to produce a state of balanced general anesthesia. Despite the obvious advantages of the less soluble inhaled anesthetics, there is reason to believe that better ones might be developed (see Do We Need Another Inhaled Anesthetic?).</p>

                                     <p>In the last two decades there has been increasing use of intravenous anesthetics in anesthesia, both as adjuncts to inhaled anesthetics and as part of techniques that do not include any inhaled anesthetics (eg, total intravenous anesthesia). The properties of some of the commonly used intravenous anesthetics are summarized in Table 25-1. Unlike inhaled anesthetics, intravenous agents do not require specialized vaporizer equipment for their delivery or facilities for the disposal of exhaled gases. Intravenous drugs such as thiopental, methohexital, etomidate, ketamine, and propofol have an onset of anesthetic action faster than the most rapid inhaled agents (eg, desflurane and sevoflurane). Therefore, intravenous agents are commonly used for induction of general anesthesia.</p>
                                    <p>Recovery is sufficiently rapid with most intravenous drugs to permit their use for short ambulatory (outpatient) surgical procedures. In the case of propofol, recovery times are similar to those seen with sevoflurane and desflurane. The anesthetic potency of intravenous anesthetics is adequate to permit their use as the sole anesthetic in short surgical procedures when combined with nitrous oxide. Adjunctive use of potent opioids (eg, fentanyl and sufentanil; see Chapter 31) contributes cardiovascular stability, enhanced sedation, and profound perioperative analgesia. Benzodiazepines (eg, midazolam, diazepam) have a slower onset and slower recovery than the barbiturates or propofol and are rarely used for induction of anesthesia. However, preanesthetic administration of benzodiazepines (eg, midazolam) can be used to provide anxiolysis, sedation, and amnesia when used in conjunction with other anesthetic agents.</p>

                                     <p>The general pharmacology of the barbiturates is discussed in Chapter 22. Thiopental is a barbiturate commonly used for induction of anesthesia. Thiamylal is structurally almost identical to thiopental and has the same pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile.</p>
                                    <p>After an intravenous bolus injection, thiopental rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier and, if given in sufficient dosage, produces loss of consciousness (hypnosis) in one circulation time. Similar effects occur with the shorter-acting barbiturate, methohexital. With both of these barbiturates, plasma: brain equilibrium occurs rapidly (<1 minute) because of their high lipid solubility. Thiopental rapidly diffuses out of the brain and other highly vascular tissues and is redistributed to muscle and fat (Figure 25-6). Because of this rapid removal from brain tissue, a single dose of thiopental produces only a brief period of unconsciousness. Thiopental is metabolized at the rate of only 12-16% per hour in humans following a single dose and less than 1% of the administered dose of thiopental is excreted unchanged by the kidney.</p>

                                    <p>Redistribution of thiopental after an intravenous bolus administration. Note that the time axis is not linear.</p>

                                     <p>With large doses (or a continuous infusion), thiopental produces dose-dependent decreases in arterial blood pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac output. These hemodynamic effects are due primarily to a myocardial depressant effect and increased venous capacitance; there is little change in total peripheral resistance. Thiopental is also a potent respiratory depressant, producing transient apnea and lowering the sensitivity of the medullary respiratory center to carbon dioxide.</p>
                                    <p>Cerebral metabolism and oxygen utilization are decreased after barbiturate administration in proportion to the degree of cerebral depression. Cerebral blood flow is also decreased, but less than oxygen consumption. Because intracranial pressure and blood volume are not increased (in contrast to the volatile anesthetics), thiopental is a desirable drug for patients with cerebral swelling (eg, head trauma, brain tumors). Methohexital can cause central excitatory activity (eg, myoclonus) and has been useful for neurosurgical procedures involving ablation of seizure foci. However, it also has antiseizure activity and is the drug of choice for providing anesthesia in patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Given its more rapid elimination, methohexital is also preferred over thiopental for short ambulatory procedures.</p>
                                    <p>Barbiturates reduce hepatic blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, but these drugs produce no adverse effects on hepatic or renal function. Barbiturates can exacerbate acute intermittent porphyria by inducing the production of hepatic a occasions, thiopental has precipitated porphyric crisis when used as an induction agent in susceptible patients.</p>

                                     <p>Diazepam, lorazepam, and midazolam are used in anesthetic procedures. The primary indication is for premedication because of their sedative, anxiolytic, and amnestic properties, and to control acute agitation. (The basic pharmacology of benzodiazepines is discussed in Chapter 22.) Diazepam and lorazepam are not water-soluble, and their intravenous use necessitates nonaqueous vehicles, which cause pain and local irritation. Midazolam is water-soluble and is the benzodiazepine of choice for parenteral administration. It is important that the drug becomes lipid-soluble at physiologic pH and can readily cross the blood-brain barrier to produce its central effects.</p>
                                    <p>Compared with the intravenous barbiturates, benzodiazepines produce a slower onset of central nervous system depressant effects which reach a plateau at a depth of sedation that is inadequate for surgical anesthesia. Using large doses of benzodiazepines to achieve deep sedation prolongs the postanesthetic recovery period and can produce a high incidence of anterograde amnesia. Because it possesses sedative-anxiolytic properties and causes a high incidence of amnesia (> 50%), midazolam is frequently administered intravenously before patients enter the operating room. Midazolam has a more rapid onset, a shorter elimination half-life (2-4 hours), and a steeper dose-response curve than do the other available benzodiazepines.</p>
                                    <p>The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can be used to accelerate recovery when excessive doses of intravenous benzodiazepines are administered (especially in elderly patients). However, reversal of benzodiazepine-induced respiratory depression is less predictable. The short duration of action (< 90 minutes) of flumazenil may necessitate multiple doses to prevent recurrence of the central nervous system depressant effects of the longer-acting benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, diazepam).</p>

                                     <p>Large doses of opioid analgesics have been used in combination with large doses of benzodiazepines to achieve a general anesthetic state, particularly in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or other major surgery when the patient's circulatory reserve is limited. Although intravenous morphine, 1-3 mg/kg, was used many years ago, the high-potency opioids fentanyl, $100-150 \mathrm{mcg}/ \mathrm{kg}$, and sufentanil, 0.25-0.5 mcg/kg IV, have been used more recently in such patients. More recently also, remifentanil, a potent and extremely short-acting opioid, has been used to minimize residual ventilatory depression.
                                        Despite the use of high doses of potent opioids (see Table 31-2), awareness during anesthesia and unpleasant postoperative recall can occur. Furthermore, high doses of opioids during surgery can cause chest wall (and laryngeal) rigidity, thereby acutely impairing ventilation, as well as increasing postoperative opioid requirements owing to the development of acute tolerance. Therefore, lower doses of fentanyl and sufentanil have been used as premedication and as an adjunct to both intravenous and inhaled anesthetics to provide perioperative analgesia. The shorter-acting alfentanil and remifentanil have been used as co-induction agents with intravenous sedative-hypnotic anesthetics because they have a rapid onset of action. Remifentanil is rapidly metabolized by esterases in the blood (not plasma cholinesterase) and muscle tissues, contributing to an extremely rapid recovery from its opioid effects. The metabolism of remifentanil is not subject to genetic variability, and the drug does not interfere with the clearance of other compounds metabolized by plasma cholinesterase (eg, esmolol, mivacurium, or succinylcholine). Opioid analgesics can also be administered in very low doses by the epidural and subarachnoid (spinal) routes of administration to produce excellent postoperative analgesia. Fentanyl and droperidol (a butyrophenone related to haloperidol) administered together produce analgesia and amnesia and combined with nitrous oxide
                                        provide a state referred to as neuroleptanesthesia.</p>

                                     <p>Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) has become the most popular intravenous anesthetic. Its rate of onset of action is similar to that of the intravenous barbiturates but recovery is more rapid and patients are able to ambulate earlier after general anesthesia. Furthermore, patients subjectively "feel better" in the immediate postoperative period because of the reduction in postoperative nausea and vomiting. Propofol is used for both induction and maintenance of anesthesia as part of total intravenous or balanced anesthesia techniques and is the agent of choice for ambulatory surgery. The drug is also effective in producing prolonged sedation in patients in critical care settings (see Conscious & Deep Sedation). When administered by prolonged infusion for sedation or ventilatory management in the intensive care unit, cumulative effects can lead to delayed arousal. In addition, prolonged administration of conventional emulsion formulations can elevate serum lipid levels. Use of propofol for the sedation of critically ill young children has led to severe acidosis in the presence of respiratory infections and to possible neurologic sequelae upon withdrawal.</p>
                                    <p>After intravenous administration of propofol, the distribution half-life is 2-8 minutes, and the redistribution half-life is approximately 30-60 minutes. The drug is rapidly metabolized in the liver at a rate ten times faster than thiopental. Propofol is excreted in the urine as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, with less than 1% of the parent drug excreted unchanged. Total body clearance of the anesthetic is greater than hepatic blood flow, suggesting that its elimination includes extrahepatic mechanisms in addition to metabolism by liver enzymes. This property can be useful in patients with impaired ability to metabolize other sedative-anesthetic drugs.</p>
                                    <p>Effects on respiratory function are similar to those of thiopental at usual anesthetic doses and include dose-related depression of central ventilatory drive and apnea. However, propofol causes a marked decrease in blood pressure during induction of anesthesia through decreased peripheral arterial resistance and venodilation. In addition, propofol has greater direct negative inotropic effects than other intravenous anesthetics. Pain at the site of injection is the most common adverse effect of bolus administration. Muscle movements, hypotonus, and (rarely) tremors have also been reported after prolonged use. Clinical infections due to bacterial contamination of the propofol emulsion have led to the addition of antimicrobial adjuvants (eg, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA] and metabisulfite). Newer formulations of propofol have been developed that contain less lipid for prolonged administration (eg, Ampofol). However, pain on injection is increased when the lipid content is reduced. Admixture or pretreatment with lidocaine (20-50 mg) is the most effective approach to minimizing the pain on injection of propofol.</p>

                                     <p>Many diagnostic and minor therapeutic surgical procedures can be performed without general anesthesia. In this setting, regional or local anesthesia supplemented with midazolam or propofol and opioid analgesics (or ketamine) may be a more appropriate and safer approach than general anesthesia.</p>
                                    <p>Another approach has led to the development of conscious sedation or drug-induced alleviation of anxiety and pain in combination with an altered level of consciousness associated with minimal sedation and retention of the ability of the patient to maintain a patent airway and to respond to verbal commands. A wide variety of intravenous anesthetic agents have proved to be useful drugs in conscious sedation techniques (eg, diazepam, midazolam, propofol). For example, intravenous midazolam, propofol, and a potent opioid analgesic can provide amnestic, sedative, and analgesic effects without loss of consciousness as part of a monitored anesthesia care (MAC) technique. Use of benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics in conscious sedation protocols has the advantage of being reversible by the specific receptor antagonist drugs (flumazenil and naloxone, respectively).</p>
                                    <p>A specialized form of conscious sedation is occasionally required in the ICU, when patients are under severe stress and require mechanical ventilation for prolonged periods. In this situation, sedative-hypnotic drugs or low doses of intravenous anesthetics, neuromuscular blocking drugs, and dexmedetomidine may be combined. Dexmedetomidine is an $\alpha_{2}$ agonist with sedative and analgesic effects. It has a half-life of 2-3 hours and is metabolized in the liver and excreted mainly as inactive urinary metabolites.</p>
                                    <p>Deep sedation is similar to a light state of general anesthesia involving decreased consciousness from which the patient is not easily aroused. Because deep sedation is often accompanied by a loss of protective reflexes, an inability to maintain a patent airway, and lack of verbal responsiveness to surgical stimuli, this state may be indistinguishable from general anesthesia. Intravenous agents used in deep sedation protocols include thiopental, methohexital, ketamine, propofol, and the potent opioid analgesics.</p>

                                     <p>Etomidate is a carboxylated imidazole that can be used for induction of anesthesia in patients with limited cardiovascular reserve. Its major advantage over other intravenous anesthetics is that it causes minimal cardiovascular and respiratory depression. Etomidate produces a rapid loss of consciousness, with minimal hypotension even in elderly patients with poor cardiovascular reserve. The heart rate is usually unchanged, and the incidence of apnea is low. The drug has no analgesic effects, and coadministration of opioids may be required to decrease cardiac responses during tracheal intubation and to lessen spontaneous muscle movements. Following an induction dose, initial recovery with etomidate is less rapid (< 10 minutes) compared with recovery with propofol.
                                        Distribution of etomidate is rapid, with a biphasic plasma concentration curve showing initial and intermediate distribution half-lives of 3 and 29 minutes, respectively. Redistribution of the drug from brain to highly perfused tissues appears to be responsible for the relatively short duration of its anesthetic effects. Etomidate is extensively metabolized in the liver and plasma to inactive
                                        metabolites, with only 2% of the drug excreted unchanged in the urine.</p>
                                    <p>Etomidate causes a high incidence of pain on injection, myoclonic activity, and postoperative nausea and vomiting. The involuntary muscle movements are not associated with electroencephalographic epileptiform activity. Etomidate may also cause adrenocortical suppression via inhibitory effects on steroidogenesis, with decreased plasma levels of cortisol after a single dose. Prolonged infusion of etomidate in critically ill patients may result in hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, and oliguria because of its adrenal suppressive effects.</p>

                                </h2>

                                     <p>Ketamine is a racemic mixture of two optical isomers, $\mathrm{S}(+)$ and $\mathrm{R}(-)$ ketamine. The drug produces a dissociative anesthetic state characterized by catatonia, amnesia, and analgesia, with or without loss of consciousness (hypnosis). The drug is an arylcyclohexylamine chemically related to phencyclidine (PCP), a drug with a high abuse potential owing to its psychoactive properties. The mechanism of action of ketamine may involve blockade of the membrane effects of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamic acid at the NMDA receptor subtype (see Chapter 21). Ketamine is a highly lipophilic drug and is rapidly distributed into well-perfused organs, including the brain, liver, and kidney. Subsequently ketamine is redistributed to less well perfused tissues with concurrent hepatic metabolism followed by both urinary and biliary excretion.</p>
                                    <p>Ketamine is the only intravenous anesthetic that possesses both analgesic properties and the ability to produce dose-related cardiovascular stimulation. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and cardiac output can be significantly increased above baseline values. These variables reach a peak 2-4 minutes after an intravenous bolus injection, then slowly decline to normal values over the next 10-20 minutes. Ketamine produces its cardiovascular effects by stimulating the central sympathetic nervous system and, to a lesser extent, by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine at sympathetic nerve terminals. Increases in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels occur as early as 2 minutes after an intravenous bolus of ketamine and return to baseline levels in less than 15 minutes.</p>
                                    <p>Ketamine markedly increases cerebral blood flow, oxygen consumption, and intracranial pressure. Similar to the volatile anesthetics, ketamine is a potentially dangerous drug when intracranial pressure is elevated. Although ketamine decreases the respiratory rate, upper airway muscle tone is well maintained and airway reflexes are usually preserved.</p>
                                    <p>Use of ketamine has been associated with postoperative disorientation, sensory and perceptual illusions, and vivid dreams (so-called emergence phenomena). Diazepam, 0.2-0.3 mg/kg, or midazolam, 0.025-0.05 mg intravenously, given before the administration of ketamine reduce the incidence of these adverse effects. Because of the high incidence of postoperative psychic phenomena associated with its use, ketamine fell into disfavor. However, use of low doses of ketamine in combination with other intravenous and inhaled anesthetics has become an increasingly popular alternative to opioid analgesics to minimize ventilatory depression. In addition, ketamine is very useful for poor-risk geriatric patients and high-risk patients in cardiogenic or septic shock because of its cardiostimulatory properties. It is also used in low doses for outpatient anesthesia in combination with propofol and in children undergoing painful procedures (eg, dressing changes for burns). In an effort to enhance ketamine's efficacy and reduce its side-effect profile, investigators separated the isomers and demonstrated that the $S(+)$ ketamine possessed greater anesthetic and analgesic potency. However,
                                        even the $S(+)$ isomer of ketamine possesses psychotomimetic side effects.</p>
