\section*{Preface}

This book is designed to provide a complete, authoritative, current, and readable pharmacology textbook for students in the health sciences. It also offers special features that make it useful to house officers and practicing clinicians.

Information is organized according to the sequence used in many pharmacology courses and in integrated organ system curricula: basic principles; autonomic drugs; cardiovascular-renal drugs; drugs with important actions on smooth muscle; central nervous system drugs; drugs used to treat inflammation, gout, and diseases of the blood; endocrine drugs; chemotherapeutic drugs; toxicology; and special topics. This sequence builds new information on a foundation of information already assimilated. For example, early presentation of autonomic pharmacology allows students to integrate the physiology and neuroscience they know with the pharmacology they are learning and prepares them to understand the autonomic effects of other drugs. This is especially important for the cardiovascular and central nervous system drug groups. However, chapters can be used equally well in courses and curricula that present these topics in a different sequence.

Within each chapter, emphasis is placed on discussion of drug groups and prototypes rather than offering repetitive detail about individual drugs. Selection of the subject matter and the order of its presentation are based on the accumulated experience of teaching this material to thousands of medical, pharmacy, dental, podiatry, nursing, and other health science students.

Major features that make this book especially useful to professional students include sections that specifically address the clinical choice and use of drugs in patients and the monitoring of their effects-in other words, clinical pharmacology is an integral part of this text. Lists of the commercial preparations available, including trade and generic names and dosage formulations, are provided at the end of each chapter for easy reference by the house officer or practitioner writing a chart order or prescription.

Significant revisions in this edition include the following:
$\square$ Major revisions of the chapters on prostaglandins, nitric oxide, anti-inflammatory drugs, hypothalamic and pituitary hormones, antidiabetic drugs, antiviral drugs, and immunopharmacology
$\square$ Many new figures, most in color, that help to clarify important concepts in pharmacology
$\square$ Many descriptions of important developments based on genetically modified mice ("knockout" and "knockin" mice), a research tool of great importance in pharmacology
$\square$ Continuing expansion of the coverage of general concepts relating to receptors and listings of newly discovered drug transporters and receptors
$\square$ Descriptions of important new drugs released through August 2006, including numerous new immunopharmacologic agents

An important related source of information is Katzung \& Trevor's Pharmacology: Examination \& Board Review, 7th ed (Trevor AJ, Katzung BG, \& Masters SB: McGraw-Hill, 2005). This book provides a succinct review of pharmacology with one of the largest available collections of sample examination questions and answers. It is especially helpful to students preparing for board-type examinations. A more highly condensed source of information suitable for review purposes is USMLE Road Map: Pharmacology, 2nd ed (Katzung BG, Trevor AJ: McGraw-Hill, 2006).

This edition marks the 25th year of publication of Basic \& Clinical Pharmacology. The widespread acceptance of the first nine editions suggests that this book fills an important need. We believe that the tenth edition will satisfy this need even more successfully. Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, Czech, Indonesian, Japanese, and Chinese translations are available. Translations into other languages are under way; the publisher may be
contacted for further information.

I wish to acknowledge the prior and continuing efforts of my contributing authors and the major contributions of the staff at Lange Medical Publications, Appleton \& Lange, and more recently at McGraw-Hill, and of our editors, Alison Kelley and Donna Frassetto. I also wish to thank my wife, Alice Camp, for her expert proofreading contributions since the first edition.

Special thanks and recognition are due James Ransom, PhD, the long-time Senior Editor at Lange Medical Publications, who provided major inspiration and invaluable guidance through the first eight editions of the book. Without him, this book would not exist.

Suggestions and comments about Basic \& Clinical Pharmacology are always welcome. They may be sent to me at the Department of Cellular \& Molecular Pharmacology, P.O. Box 0450, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143-0450.

\section*{I NTRODUCTION TO PHARMACOLOGY: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Pharmacology can be defined as the study of substances that interact with living systems through chemical processes, especially by binding to regulatory molecules and activating or inhibiting normal body processes. These substances may be chemicals administered to achieve a beneficial therapeutic effect on some process within the patient or for their toxic effects on regulatory processes in parasites infecting the patient. Such deliberate therapeutic applications may be considered the proper role of medical pharmacology, which is often defined as the science of substances used to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease. Toxicology is that branch of pharmacology which deals with the undesirable effects of chemicals on living systems, from individual cells to complex ecosystems.

\section*{THE HISTORY OF PHARMACOLOGY}

Prehistoric people undoubtedly recognized the beneficial or toxic effects of many plant and animal materials. Early written records from China and from Egypt list remedies of many types, including a few still recognized as useful drugs today. Most, however, were worthless or actually harmful. In the 1500 years or so preceding the present, there were sporadic attempts to introduce rational methods into medicine, but none was successful owing to the dominance of systems of thought that purported to explain all of biology and disease without the need for experimentation and observation. These schools promulgated bizarre notions such as the idea that disease was caused by excesses of bile or blood in the body, that wounds could be healed by applying a salve to the weapon that caused the wound, and so on.

Around the end of the 17th century, reliance on observation and experimentation began to replace theorizing in medicine, following the example of the physical sciences. As the value of these methods in the study of disease became clear, physicians in Great Britain and on the Continent began to apply them to the effects of traditional drugs used in their own practices. Thus, materia medica-the science of drug preparation and the medical use of drugs-began to develop as the precursor to pharmacology. However, any real understanding of the mechanisms of action of drugs was prevented by the absence of methods for purifying active agents from the crude materials that were available and-even more-by the lack of methods for testing hypotheses about the nature of drug actions.

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, François Magendie, and later his student Claude Bernard, began to develop the methods of experimental animal physiology and pharmacology. Advances in chemistry and the further development of physiology in the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries laid the foundation needed for understanding how drugs work at the organ and tissue levels. Paradoxically, real advances in basic pharmacology during this time were accompanied by an outburst of unscientific promotion by manufacturers and marketers of worthless "patent medicines." Not until the concepts of rational therapeutics, especially that of the controlled clinical trial, were reintroduced into medicine-only about 50 years ago-did it become possible to accurately evaluate therapeutic claims.

Around the same time, a major expansion of research efforts in all areas of biology began. As new concepts and new techniques were introduced, information accumulated about drug action and the biologic substrate of that action, the drug receptor. During the last half-century, many fundamentally new drug groups and new members of old groups were introduced. The last three decades have seen an
even more rapid growth of information and understanding of the molecular basis for drug action. The molecular mechanisms of action of many drugs have now been identified, and numerous receptors have been isolated, structurally characterized, and cloned. In fact, the use of receptor identification methods (described in Chapter 2) has led to the discovery of many orphan receptors-receptors for which no ligand has been discovered and whose function can only be surmised. Studies of the local molecular environment of receptors have shown that receptors and effectors do not function in isolation; they are strongly influenced by companion regulatory proteins. Decoding of the genomes of many species-from bacteria to humans-has led to the recognition of unsuspected relationships between receptor families and the ways that receptor proteins have evolved. Pharmacogenomics-the relation of the individual's genetic makeup to his or her response to specific drugs-is close to becoming a practical area of therapy (see Pharmacology \& Genetics). Much of that progress is summarized in this book.

The extension of scientific principles into everyday therapeutics is still going on, although the medication-consuming public unfortunately is still exposed to vast amounts of inaccurate, incomplete, or unscientific information regarding the pharmacologic effects of chemicals. This has resulted in the faddish use of innumerable expensive, ineffective, and sometimes harmful remedies and the growth of a huge "alternative health care" industry. Conversely, lack of understanding of basic scientific principles in biology and statistics and the absence of critical thinking about public health issues have led to rejection of medical science by a segment of the public and to a common tendency to assume that all adverse drug effects are the result of malpractice.

Two general principles that the student should always remember are, first, that all substances can under certain circumstances be toxic; and second, that all dietary supplements and all therapies promoted as health-enhancing should meet the same standards of efficacy and safety, ie, there should be no artificial separation between scientific medicine and "alternative" or "complementary" medicine.

\section*{Pharmacology \& Genetics}

It has been known for centuries that certain diseases are inherited, and we now understand that individuals with such diseases have a heritable abnormality in their DNA. During the last 10 years, the genomes of humans, mice, and many other organisms have been decoded in considerable detail. This has opened the door to a remarkable range of new approaches to research and treatment. It is now possible in the case of some inherited diseases to define exactly which DNA base pairs are anomalous and in which chromosome they appear. In a small number of animal models of such diseases, it has been possible to correct the abnormality by gene therapy, ie, insertion of an appropriate "healthy" gene into somatic cells. Human somatic cell gene therapy has been attempted, but the technical difficulties are great.

Studies of a newly discovered receptor or endogenous ligand are often confounded by incomplete knowledge of the exact role of that receptor or ligand. One of the most powerful of the new genetic techniques is the ability to breed animals (usually mice) in which the gene for the receptor or its endogenous ligand has been "knocked out," ie, mutated so that the gene product is absent or nonfunctional. Homozygous knockout mice usually have complete suppression of that function, whereas heterozygous animals usually have partial suppression. Observation of the behavior, biochemistry, and physiology of the knockout mice often defines the role of the missing gene product very clearly. When the products of a particular gene are so essential that even heterozygotes do not survive to birth, it is sometimes possible to breed "knockdown" versions with only limited suppression of
function. Conversely, "knockin" mice have been bred, which overexpress certain proteins of interest.
Some patients respond to certain drugs with greater than usual sensitivity to standard doses. It is now clear that such increased sensitivity is often due to a very small genetic modification that results in decreased activity of a particular enzyme responsible for eliminating that drug. (Such variations are discussed in Chapter 4.) Pharmacogenomics (or pharmacogenetics) is the study of the genetic variations that cause differences in drug response among individuals or populations. Future clinicians may screen every patient for a variety of such differences before prescribing a drug.

\section*{PHARMACOLOGY \& THE PHARMACEUTICAL I NDUSTRY}

Much of the recent progress in the application of drugs to disease problems can be ascribed to the pharmaceutical industry and specifically to "big pharma," the multibillion-dollar corporations that specialize in drug discovery and development. These entities deserve great credit for making possible many of the therapeutic advances that we enjoy today. As described in Chapter 5, these companies are uniquely skilled in exploiting discoveries from academic and governmental laboratories and translating these basic findings into commercially successful therapeutic breakthroughs.

Such breakthroughs come at a price, however, and the escalating cost of drugs has become a significant contributor to the inflationary increase in the cost of health care. Development of new drugs is enormously expensive and to survive and prosper, big pharma must pay the costs of drug development and marketing and return a profit to its shareholders. At present, considerable controversy surrounds drug pricing. Critics claim that the costs of development and marketing are grossly inflated by marketing procedures, which may consume as much as $25 \%$ or more of a company's budget in advertising and other promotional efforts. Furthermore, profit margins for big pharma have historically exceeded all other industries by a significant factor. Finally, pricing schedules for many drugs vary dramatically from country to country and even within countries, where large organizations can negotiate favorable prices and small ones cannot. Some countries have already addressed these problems, and it seems likely that all countries will have to do so during the next few decades.

\section*{GENERAL PRI NCI PLES OF PHARMACOLOGY The Nature of Drugs}

In the most general sense, a drug may be defined as any substance that brings about a change in biologic function through its chemical actions. In the great majority of cases, the drug molecule interacts with a specific molecule in the biologic system that plays a regulatory role. This molecule is called a receptor. The nature of receptors is discussed more fully in Chapter 2. In a very small number of cases, drugs known as chemical antagonists may interact directly with other drugs, whereas a few drugs (osmotic agents) interact almost exclusively with water molecules. Drugs may be synthesized within the body (eg, hormones) or may be chemicals not synthesized in the body, ie, xenobiotics (from the Greek xenos, meaning "stranger"). Poisons are drugs that have almost exclusively harmful effects. However, Paracelsus (1493-1541) famously stated that "the dose makes the poison," meaning that almost all substances can be harmful if taken in the wrong dosage. Toxins are usually defined as poisons of biologic origin, ie, synthesized by plants or animals, in contrast to inorganic poisons such as lead and arsenic.

To interact chemically with its receptor, a drug molecule must have the appropriate size, electrical charge, shape, and atomic composition. Furthermore, a drug is often administered at a location distant from its intended site of action, eg, a pill given orally to relieve a headache. Therefore, a useful drug must have the necessary properties to be transported from its site of administration to its site of action. Finally, a practical drug should be inactivated or excreted from the body at a reasonable rate so that its actions will be of appropriate duration.

\section*{THE PHYSI CAL NATURE OF DRUGS}

Drugs may be solid at room temperature (eg, aspirin, atropine), liquid (eg, nicotine, ethanol), or gaseous (eg, nitrous oxide). These factors often determine the best route of administration. The most common routes of administration are described in Chapter 3. The various classes of organic compounds-carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and their constituents-are all represented in pharmacology.

A number of useful or dangerous drugs are inorganic elements, eg, lithium, iron, and heavy metals. Many organic drugs are weak acids or bases. This fact has important implications for the way they are handled by the body, because pH differences in the various compartments of the body may alter the degree of ionization of such drugs (see below).

\section*{DRUG SIZE}

The molecular size of drugs varies from very small (lithium ion, MW 7) to very large (eg, alteplase [tPA], a protein of MW 59,050). However, most drugs have molecular weights between 100 and 1000. The lower limit of this narrow range is probably set by the requirements for specificity of action. To have a good "fit" to only one type of receptor, a drug molecule must be sufficiently unique in shape, charge, and other properties, to prevent its binding to other receptors. To achieve such selective binding, it appears that a molecule should in most cases be at least 100 MW units in size. The upper limit in molecular weight is determined primarily by the requirement that drugs be able to move within the body (eg, from site of administration to site of action). Drugs much larger than MW 1000 do not diffuse readily between compartments of the body (see Permeation, below). Therefore, very large drugs (usually proteins) must often be administered directly into the compartment where they have their effect. In the case of alteplase, a clot-dissolving enzyme, the drug is administered directly into the vascular compartment by intravenous or intra-arterial infusion.

\section*{DRUG REACTIVITY AND DRUG-RECEPTOR BONDS}

Drugs interact with receptors by means of chemical forces or bonds. These are of three major types: covalent, electrostatic, and hydrophobic. Covalent bonds are very strong and in many cases not reversible under biologic conditions. Thus, the covalent bond formed between the acetyl group of aspirin and its enzyme target in platelets, cyclooxygenase, is not readily broken. The platelet aggregation-blocking effect of aspirin lasts long after free acetylsalicylic acid has disappeared from the bloodstream (about 15 minutes) and is reversed only by the synthesis of new enzyme in new platelets, a process that takes about 7 days. Other examples of highly reactive, covalent bond-forming drugs are the DNA-alkylating agents used in cancer chemotherapy to disrupt cell division in the tumor.

Electrostatic bonding is much more common than covalent bonding in drug-receptor interactions. Electrostatic bonds vary from relatively strong linkages between permanently charged ionic molecules to weaker hydrogen bonds and very weak induced dipole interactions such as van der Waals forces and similar phenomena. Electrostatic bonds are weaker than covalent bonds.

Hydrophobic bonds are usually quite weak and are probably important in the interactions of highly lipidsoluble drugs with the lipids of cell membranes and perhaps in the interaction of drugs with the internal walls of receptor "pockets."

The specific nature of a particular drug-receptor bond is of less practical importance than the fact that drugs that bind through weak bonds to their receptors are generally more selective than drugs that bind by means of very strong bonds. This is because weak bonds require a very precise fit of the drug to its receptor if an interaction is to occur. Only a few receptor types are likely to provide such a precise fit for a particular drug structure. Thus, if we wished to design a highly selective short-acting drug for a particular receptor, we would avoid highly reactive molecules that form covalent bonds and instead choose molecules that form weaker bonds.

A few substances that are almost completely inert in the chemical sense nevertheless have significant pharmacologic effects. For example, xenon, an "inert" gas, has anesthetic effects at elevated pressures.

\section*{DRUG SHAPE}

The shape of a drug molecule must be such as to permit binding to its receptor site via the bonds just described. Optimally, the drug's shape is complementary to that of the receptor site in the same way that a key is complementary to a lock. Furthermore, the phenomenon of chirality (stereoisomerism) is so common in biology that more than half of all useful drugs are chiral molecules; that is, they exist as enantiomeric pairs. Drugs with two asymmetric centers have four diastereomers, eg, ephedrine, a sympathomimetic drug. In most cases, one of these enantiomers is much more potent than its mirror image enantiomer, reflecting a better fit to the receptor molecule. For example, the ( S ) ( + ) enantiomer of methacholine, a parasympathomimetic drug, is over 250 times more potent than the (R)(-) enantiomer. If one imagines the receptor site to be like a glove into which the drug molecule must fit to bring about its effect, it is clear why a "left-oriented" drug is more effective in binding to a left-hand receptor than its "right-oriented" enantiomer.

The more active enantiomer at one type of receptor site may not be more active at another type, eg, a receptor type that may be responsible for some other effect. For example, carvedilol, a drug that interacts with adrenoceptors, has a single chiral center and thus two enantiomers (Table 1-1). One of these enantiomers, the $(S)(-)$ isomer, is a potent $B$-receptor blocker. The $(R)(+)$ isomer is 100 -fold weaker at the Breceptor. However, the isomers are approximately equipotent as a-receptor blockers. Ketamine is an intravenous anesthetic. The (+) enantiomer is a more potent anesthetic and is less toxic than the (-) enantiomer. Unfortunately, the drug is still used as the racemic mixture.

Table 1-1. Dissociation Constants ( $K_{d}$ ) of the Enantiomers and Racemate of Carvedilol.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Form of Carvedilol & Inverse of Affinity for Receptors ( $K_{d}, \mathrm{nmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) & Inverse of Affinity for Receptors ( $K_{d}, \mathrm{nmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) \\
\hline R(+) enantiomer & 14 & 45 \\
\hline S(-) enantiomer & 16 & 0.4 \\
\hline R,S(+/-) enantiomers & 11 & 0.9 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Note: The $K_{d}$ is the concentration for $50 \%$ saturation of the receptors and is inversely proportionate to the affinity of the drug for the receptors.

Data from Ruffolo RR et al: The pharmacology of carvedilol. Eur J Pharmacol 1990;38: S82.
Finally, because enzymes are usually stereoselective, one drug enantiomer is often more susceptible than the other to drug-metabolizing enzymes. As a result, the duration of action of one enantiomer may be quite different from that of the other.

Unfortunately, most studies of clinical efficacy and drug elimination in humans have been carried out with racemic mixtures of drugs rather than with the separate enantiomers. At present, only about $45 \%$ of the chiral drugs used clinically are marketed as the active isomer-the rest are available only as racemic mixtures. As a result, many patients are receiving drug doses of which $50 \%$ or more is less active, inactive, or actively toxic. However, there is increasing interest at both the scientific and the regulatory levels in making more chiral drugs available as their active enantiomers.

\section*{RATIONAL DRUG DESIGN}

Rational design of drugs implies the ability to predict the appropriate molecular structure of a drug on the basis of information about its biologic receptor. Until recently, no receptor was known in sufficient detail to permit such drug design. Instead, drugs were developed through random testing of chemicals or modification of drugs already known to have some effect (see Chapter 5). However, during the past three decades, many receptors have been isolated and characterized. A few drugs now in use were developed through molecular design based on a knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the receptor site. Computer programs are now available that can iteratively optimize drug structures to fit known receptors. As more becomes known about receptor structure, rational drug design will become more common.

\section*{RECEPTOR NOMENCLATURE}

The spectacular success of newer, more efficient ways to identify and characterize receptors (see Chapter 2) has resulted in a variety of differing systems for naming them. This in turn has led to a number of suggestions regarding more rational methods of naming them. The interested reader is referred for details to the efforts of the International Union of Pharmacology (IUPHAR) Committee on

Receptor Nomenclature and Drug Classification (reported in various issues of Pharmacological Reviews) and to Alexander SPH, Mathie A, Peters JA: Guide to receptors and channels. Br J Pharmacol 2006;147(Suppl 3):S1-S180. The chapters in this book mainly use these sources for naming receptors.

\section*{Drug-Body Interactions}

The interactions between a drug and the body are conveniently divided into two classes. The actions of the drug on the body are termed pharmacodynamic processes; the principles of pharmacodynamics are presented in greater detail in Chapter 2. These properties determine the group in which the drug is classified and play the major role in deciding whether that group is appropriate therapy for a particular symptom or disease. The actions of the body on the drug are called pharmacokinetic processes and are described in Chapters 3 and 4. Pharmacokinetic processes govern the absorption, distribution, and elimination of drugs and are of great practical importance in the choice and administration of a particular drug for a particular patient, eg, a patient with impaired renal function. The following paragraphs provide a brief introduction to pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.

\section*{Pharmacodynamic Principles}

Most drugs must bind to a receptor to bring about an effect. However, at the molecular level, drug binding is only the first in what is often a complex sequence of steps.

\section*{TYPES OF DRUG-RECEPTOR INTERACTIONS}

Agonist drugs bind to and activate the receptor in some fashion, which directly or indirectly brings about the effect. Some receptors incorporate effector machinery in the same molecule, so that drug binding brings about the effect directly, eg, opening of an ion channel or activation of enzyme activity. Other receptors are linked through one or more intervening coupling molecules to a separate effector molecule. The five major types of drug-receptor-effector coupling systems are discussed in Chapter 2. Pharmacologic antagonist drugs, by binding to a receptor, prevent binding by other molecules. For example, acetylcholine receptor blockers such as atropine are antagonists because they prevent access of acetylcholine and similar agonist drugs to the acetylcholine receptor and they stabilize the receptor in its inactive state. These agents reduce the effects of acetylcholine and similar molecules in the body.

\section*{AGONISTS THAT INHIBIT THEIR BINDING MOLECULES AND PARTIAL AGONISTS}

Some drugs mimic agonist drugs by inhibiting the molecules responsible for terminating the action of an endogenous agonist. For example, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, by slowing the destruction of endogenous acetylcholine, cause cholinomimetic effects that closely resemble the actions of cholinoceptor agonist molecules even though cholinesterase inhibitors do not bind or only incidentally bind to cholinoceptors (see Chapter 7, Cholinoceptor-Activating \& Cholinesterase-Inhibiting Drugs). Other drugs bind to receptors and activate them but do not evoke as great a response as so-called full agonists. Thus, pindolol, a Badrenoceptor "partial agonist," may act as either an agonist (if no full agonist is present) or as an antagonist (if a full agonist such as epinephrine is present). (See Chapter 2.)

\section*{DURATION OF DRUG ACTION}

Termination of drug action at the receptor level results from one of several processes. In some cases, the effect lasts only as long as the drug occupies the receptor, so that dissociation of drug from the receptor automatically terminates the effect. In many cases, however, the action may persist after the drug has dissociated, because, for example, some coupling molecule is still present in activated form. In
the case of drugs that bind covalently to the receptor site, the effect may persist until the drug-receptor complex is destroyed and new receptors or enzymes are synthesized, as described previously for aspirin. Finally, many receptor-effector systems incorporate desensitization mechanisms for preventing excessive activation when agonist molecules continue to be present for long periods. See Chapter 2 for additional details.

\section*{RECEPTORS AND INERT BINDING SITES}

To function as a receptor, an endogenous molecule must first be selective in choosing ligands (drug molecules) to bind; and second, it must change its function upon binding in such a way that the function of the biologic system (cell, tissue, etc) is altered. The first characteristic is required to avoid constant activation of the receptor by promiscuous binding of many different ligands. The second characteristic is clearly necessary if the ligand is to cause a pharmacologic effect. The body contains many molecules that are capable of binding drugs, however, and not all of these endogenous molecules are regulatory molecules. Binding of a drug to a nonregulatory molecule such as plasma albumin will result in no detectable change in the function of the biologic system, so this endogenous molecule can be called an inert binding site. Such binding is not completely without significance, however, because it affects the distribution of drug within the body and determines the amount of free drug in the circulation. Both of these factors are of pharmacokinetic importance (see below and Chapter 3).

\section*{Pharmacokinetic Principles}

In practical therapeutics, a drug should be able to reach its intended site of action after administration by some convenient route. In some cases, a chemical that is readily absorbed and distributed is administered and then converted to the active drug by biologic processes-inside the body. Such a chemical is called a prodrug.

In only a few situations is it possible to directly apply a drug to its target tissue, eg, by topical application of an anti-inflammatory agent to inflamed skin or mucous membrane. Most often, a drug is administered into one body compartment, eg, the gut, and must move to its site of action in another compartment, eg, the brain. This requires that the drug be absorbed into the blood from its site of administration and distributed to its site of action, permeating through the various barriers that separate these compartments. For a drug given orally to produce an effect in the central nervous system, these barriers include the tissues that make up the wall of the intestine, the walls of the capillaries that perfuse the gut, and the "blood-brain barrier," the walls of the capillaries that perfuse the brain. Finally, after bringing about its effect, a drug should be eliminated at a reasonable rate by metabolic inactivation, by excretion from the body, or by a combination of these processes.

\section*{PERMEATION}

Drug permeation proceeds by several mechanisms. Passive diffusion in an aqueous or lipid medium is common, but active processes play a role in the movement of many drugs, especially those whose molecules are too large to diffuse readily.

\section*{Aqueous Diffusion}

Aqueous diffusion occurs within the larger aqueous compartments of the body (interstitial space, cytosol, etc) and across epithelial membrane tight junctions and the endothelial lining of blood vessels through aqueous pores that-in some tissues-permit the passage of molecules as large as MW 20,000-30,000.*

Aqueous diffusion of drug molecules is usually driven by the concentration gradient of the permeating drug, a downhill movement described by Fick's law (see below). Drug molecules that are bound to large plasma proteins (eg, albumin) do not permeate most vascular aqueous pores. If the drug is charged, its flux is also influenced by electrical fields (eg, the membrane potential and-in parts of the nephron-the transtubular potential).
*The capillaries of the brain, the testes, and some other tissues are characterized by the absence of pores that permit aqueous diffusion. They may also contain high concentrations of drug export pumps (MDR pumps; see text). These tissues are therefore protected or "sanctuary" sites from many circulating drugs.

\section*{Lipid Diffusion}

Lipid diffusion is the most important limiting factor for drug permeation because of the large number of lipid barriers that separate the compartments of the body. Because these lipid barriers separate aqueous compartments, the lipid:aqueous partition coefficient of a drug determines how readily the molecule moves between aqueous and lipid media. In the case of weak acids and weak bases (which gain or lose electrical charge-bearing protons, depending on the pH ), the ability to move from aqueous to lipid or vice versa varies with the pH of the medium, because charged molecules attract water molecules. The ratio of lipid-soluble form to water-soluble form for a weak acid or weak base is expressed by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (see below).

\section*{Special Carriers}

Special carrier molecules exist for certain substances that are important for cell function and too large or too insoluble in lipid to diffuse passively through membranes, eg, peptides, amino acids, glucose. These carriers bring about movement by active transport or facilitated diffusion and, unlike passive diffusion, are saturable and inhibitable. Because many drugs are or resemble such naturally occurring peptides, amino acids, or sugars, they can use these carriers to cross membranes.

Many cells also contain less selective membrane carriers that are specialized for expelling foreign molecules. One large family of such transporters bind adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and is called the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) family. This family includes the P-glycoprotein or multidrug-resistance type 1 (MDR1) transporter found in the brain, testes, and other tissues, and in some drug-resistant neoplastic cells. Similar transport molecules from the ABC family, the multidrug resistanceassociated protein (MRP1 through MRP5) transporters, play important roles in excretion of some drugs or their metabolites into urine and bile and in resistance of some tumors to chemotherapeutic drugs. Several other transporter families have been identified that do not bind ATP but use ion gradients for transport energy. Some of these are particularly important in the uptake of neurotransmitters across nerve ending membranes.

\section*{Endocytosis and Exocytosis}

A few substances are so large or impermeant that they can enter cells only by endocytosis, the process by which the substance is engulfed by the cell membrane and carried into the cell by pinching off of the newly formed vesicle inside the membrane. The substance can then be released inside the cytosol by breakdown of the vesicle membrane. This process is responsible for the transport of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, complexed with a binding protein (intrinsic factor) across the wall of the gut into the blood. Similarly, iron is transported into hemoglobin-synthesizing red blood cell precursors in association with the protein transferrin. Specific receptors for the transport proteins must be present for this process to work.

The reverse process (exocytosis) is responsible for the secretion of many substances from cells. For example, many neurotransmitter substances are stored in membrane-bound vesicles in nerve endings to protect them from metabolic destruction in the cytoplasm. Appropriate activation of the nerve ending causes fusion of the storage vesicle with the cell membrane and expulsion of its contents into the extracellular space (see Chapter 6).

\section*{FICK'S LAW OF DIFFUSION}

The passive flux of molecules down a concentration gradient is given by Fick's law:
Flux (molecules per unit time) $=$
$$\left(C_{1}-C_{2}\right) \times \frac{\text { Area } \times \text { Permeability coefficient }}{\text { Thickness }}$$
where $\mathrm{C}_{1}$ is the higher concentration, $\mathrm{C}_{2}$ is the lower concentration, area is the area across which diffusion is occurring, permeability coefficient is a measure of the mobility of the drug molecules in the medium of the diffusion path, and thickness is the thickness (length) of the diffusion path. In the case of lipid diffusion, the lipid: aqueous partition coefficient is a major determinant of mobility of the drug, because it determines how readily the drug enters the lipid membrane from the aqueous medium.

\section*{IONIZATION OF WEAK ACIDS AND WEAK BASES; THE HENDERSON-HASSELBALCH EQUATION}

The electrostatic charge of an ionized molecule attracts water dipoles and results in a polar, relatively water-soluble and lipid-insoluble complex. Because lipid diffusion depends on relatively high lipid solubility, ionization of drugs may markedly reduce their ability to permeate membranes. A very large fraction of the drugs in use are weak acids or weak bases (Table 1-2). For drugs, a weak acid is best defined as a neutral molecule that can reversibly dissociate into an anion (a negatively charged molecule) and a proton (a hydrogen ion). For example, aspirin dissociates as follows:
$\mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{7} \mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{COOH} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{7} \mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{COO}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$

A drug that is a weak base can be defined as a neutral molecule that can form a cation (a positively charged molecule) by combining with a proton. For example, pyrimethamine, an antimalarial drug, undergoes the following association-dissociation process:
$\mathrm{C}_{12} \mathrm{H}_{11} \mathrm{CIN}_{3} \mathrm{NH}_{3}^{+} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{C}_{12} \mathrm{H}_{11} \mathrm{CIN}_{3} \mathrm{NH}_{2}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$
$\begin{array}{ll}\begin{array}{l}\text { Pyrimethamine } \\ \text { cation }\end{array} & \begin{array}{l}\text { Neutral } \\ \text { pyrimethamine }\end{array}\end{array}$ Proton
Note that the protonated form of a weak acid is the neutral, more lipid-soluble form, whereas the unprotonated form of a weak base is the neutral form. The law of mass action requires that these reactions move to the left in an acid environment (low pH, excess protons available) and to the right in an alkaline environment. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates the ratio of protonated to unprotonated weak acid or weak base to the molecule's $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}$ and the pH of the medium as follows:
$\log \frac{\text { (Protonated) }}{\text { (Unprotonated) }}=\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}-\mathrm{pH}$
This equation applies to both acidic and basic drugs. Inspection confirms that the lower the pH relative to the $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}$, the greater will be the fraction of drug in the protonated form. Because the uncharged form is the more lipid-soluble, more of a weak acid will be in the lipid-soluble form at acid pH , whereas more of a basic drug will be in the lipid-soluble form at alkaline pH .

Application of this principle is made in the manipulation of drug excretion by the kidney. Almost all drugs are filtered at the glomerulus. If a drug is in a lipid-soluble form during its passage down the renal tubule, a significant fraction will be reabsorbed by simple passive diffusion. If the goal is to accelerate excretion of the drug (eg, in a case of drug overdose), it is important to prevent its reabsorption from the tubule. This can often be accomplished by adjusting urine pH to make certain that most of the drug is in the ionized state, as shown in Figure 1-1. As a result of this partitioning effect, the drug will be "trapped" in the urine. Thus, weak acids are usually excreted faster in alkaline urine; weak bases are usually excreted faster in acidic urine. Other body fluids in which pH differences from blood pH may cause trapping or reabsorption are the contents of the stomach and small intestine; breast milk; aqueous humor; and vaginal and prostatic secretions (Table 1-3).

Trapping of a weak base (pyrimethamine) in the urine when the urine is more acidic than the blood. In the hypothetical case illustrated, the diffusible uncharged form of the drug has equilibrated across the membrane, but the total concentration (charged plus uncharged) in the urine is almost eight times higher than in the blood.

As suggested by Table 1-2, a large number of drugs are weak bases. Most of these bases are aminecontaining molecules. The nitrogen of a neutral amine has three atoms associated with it plus a pair of unshared electrons (see the display that follows). The three atoms may consist of one carbon (designated "R") and two hydrogens (a primary amine), two carbons and one hydrogen (a secondary amine), or three carbon atoms (a tertiary amine). Each of these three forms may reversibly bind a proton with the unshared electrons. Some drugs have a fourth carbon-nitrogen bond; these are quaternary amines. However, the quaternary amine is permanently charged and has no unshared electrons with which to reversibly bind a proton. Therefore, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines may undergo reversible protonation and vary their lipid solubility with pH , but quaternary amines are always in the poorly lipid-soluble charged form.

\section*{Drug Groups}

To learn each pertinent fact about each of the many hundreds of drugs mentioned in this book would be
an impractical goal and, fortunately, is unnecessary. Almost all of the several thousand drugs currently available can be arranged in about 70 groups. Many of the drugs within each group are very similar in pharmacodynamic actions and often in their pharmacokinetic properties as well. For most groups, one or more prototype drugs can be identified that typify the most important characteristics of the group. This permits classification of other important drugs in the group as variants of the prototype, so that only the prototype must be learned in detail and, for the remaining drugs, only the differences from the prototype.

\section*{Sources of Information}

Students who wish to review the field of pharmacology in preparation for an examination are referred to Pharmacology: Examination and Board Review, by Trevor, Katzung, and Masters (McGraw-Hill, 2005) or USMLE Road Map: Pharmacology, by Katzung and Trevor (McGraw-Hill, 2006).

The references at the end of each chapter in this book were selected to provide reviews, or classic publications, of information specific to those chapters. Specific questions relating to basic or clinical research are best answered by referring to the journals covering general pharmacology and clinical specialties. For the student and the physician, three periodicals can be recommended as especially useful sources of current information about drugs: The New England Journal of Medicine, which publishes much original drug-related clinical research as well as frequent reviews of topics in pharmacology; The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics, which publishes brief critical reviews of new and old therapies, mostly pharmacologic; and Drugs, which publishes extensive reviews of drugs and drug groups.

Other sources of information pertinent to the USA should be mentioned as well. The "package insert" is a summary of information that the manufacturer is required to place in the prescription sales package; Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR) is a compendium of package inserts published annually with supplements twice a year. The USP DI (vol 1, Drug Information for the Health Care Professional) is a large annual drug compendium with monthly Internet updates published by the Micromedex Corporation. The package insert consists of a brief description of the pharmacology of the product. While this brochure contains much practical information, it is also used as a means of shifting liability for untoward drug reactions from the manufacturer onto the practitioner. Therefore, the manufacturer typically lists every toxic effect ever reported, no matter how rare. A useful and objective quarterly handbook that presents information on drug toxicity and interactions is Drug Interactions: Analysis and Management. Finally, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has an Internet website that carries news regarding recent drug approvals, withdrawals, warnings, etc. It can be reached using a personal computer equipped with Internet browser software at http://www.fda.gov.

\section*{DRUG RECEPTORS \& PHARMACODYNAMI CS: I NTRODUCTI ON}

Therapeutic and toxic effects of drugs result from their interactions with molecules in the patient. Most drugs ac by associating with specific macromolecules in ways that alter the macromolecules' biochemical or biophysical activities. This idea, more than a century old, is embodied in the term receptor: the component of a cell or organism that interacts with a drug and initiates the chain of events leading to the drug's observed effects.

Receptors have become the central focus of investigation of drug effects and their mechanisms of action (pharmacodynamics). The receptor concept, extended to endocrinology, immunology, and molecular biology, $h$. proved essential for explaining many aspects of biologic regulation. Many drug receptors have been isolated an characterized in detail, thus opening the way to precise understanding of the molecular basis of drug action.

The receptor concept has important practical consequences for the development of drugs and for arriving at therapeutic decisions in clinical practice. These consequences form the basis for understanding the actions and clinical uses of drugs described in almost every chapter of this book. They may be briefly summarized as follow:
(1) Receptors largely determine the quantitative relations between dose or concentration of drug a pharmacologic effects. The receptor's affinity for binding a drug determines the concentration of drug require to form a significant number of drug-receptor complexes, and the total number of receptors may limit the maximal effect a drug may produce.
(2) Receptors are responsible for selectivity of drug action. The molecular size, shape, and electrical charge of a drug determine whether-and with what affinity-it will bind to a particular receptor among the vasi array of chemically different binding sites available in a cell, tissue, or patient. Accordingly, changes in the chemical structure of a drug can dramatically increase or decrease a new drug's affinities for different classes o receptors, with resulting alterations in therapeutic and toxic effects.
(3) Receptors mediate the actions of both pharmacologic agonists and antagonists. Some drugs and many natural ligands, such as hormones and neurotransmitters, regulate the function of receptor macromolecu as agonists; ie, they activate the receptor to signal as a direct result of binding to it. Some agonists activate a single kind of receptor to produce all of their biologic functions, whereas others selectively promote one receptc function more than another.

Other drugs act as pharmacologic antagonists; ie, they bind to receptors but do not activate generation of a signal; consequently, they interfere with the ability of an agonist to activate the receptor. The effect of a so-call "pure" antagonist on a cell or in a patient depends entirely on its preventing the binding of agonist molecules ar blocking their biologic actions. Other antagonists, in addition to preventing agonist binding, suppress the basal signaling ("constitutive") activity of receptors. Some of the most useful drugs in clinical medicine are pharmacologic antagonists.

\section*{MACROMOLECULAR NATURE OF DRUG RECEPTORS}

Most receptors are proteins, presumably because the structures of polypeptides provide both the necessary diversity and the necessary specificity of shape and electrical charge. Receptors vary greatly in structure and ce
be identified in many ways. Traditionally, drug binding was used to identify or purify receptors from tissue extracts; consequently, receptors were discovered more recently than the drugs that bind to them. However, advances in molecular biology and genome sequencing have begun to reverse this order. Now receptors are be discovered by predicted structure or sequence homology to other (known) receptors, and drugs that bind to the are developed later using chemical screening methods. This effort has revealed, for many known drugs, a large diversity of receptors than previously anticipated. It has also identified a number of "orphan" receptors, so-call because their ligands are presently unknown, which may prove to be useful targets for the development of new drugs.

The best-characterized drug receptors are regulatory proteins, which mediate the actions of endogenous chemical signals such as neurotransmitters, autacoids, and hormones. This class of receptors mediates the effe of many of the most useful therapeutic agents. The molecular structures and biochemical mechanisms of these regulatory receptors are described in a later section entitled Signaling Mechanisms \& Drug Action.

Other classes of proteins that have been clearly identified as drug receptors include enzymes, which may be inhibited (or, less commonly, activated) by binding a drug (eg, dihydrofolate reductase, the receptor for the antineoplastic drug methotrexate); transport proteins (eg, $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase, the membrane receptor for cardioactive digitalis glycosides); and structural proteins (eg, tubulin, the receptor for colchicine, an antiinflammatory agent).

This chapter deals with three aspects of drug receptor function, presented in increasing order of complexity: (1 Receptors as determinants of the quantitative relation between the concentration of a drug and the pharmacolc response. (2) Receptors as regulatory proteins and components of chemical signaling mechanisms that provide targets for important drugs. (3) Receptors as key determinants of the therapeutic and toxic effects of drugs in patients.

\section*{RELATION BETWEEN DRUG CONCENTRATION \& RESPONSE}

The relation between dose of a drug and the clinically observed response may be complex. In carefully controlle in vitro systems, however, the relation between concentration of a drug and its effect is often simple and can bı described with mathematical precision. This idealized relation underlies the more complex relations between do and effect that occur when drugs are given to patients.

\section*{Concentration-Effect Curves \& Receptor Binding of Agonists}

Even in intact animals or patients, responses to low doses of a drug usually increase in direct proportion to dos' As doses increase, however, the response increment diminishes; finally, doses may be reached at which no further increase in response can be achieved. In idealized or in vitro systems, the relation between drug concentration and effect is described by a hyperbolic curve (Figure 2-1A) according to the following equation:
$E=\frac{E_{\text {max }} \times C}{C+E C_{50}}$
where E is the effect observed at concentration $\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{E}_{\text {max }}$ is the maximal response that can be produced by the drug, and $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ is the concentration of drug that produces $50 \%$ of maximal effect.
Figure 2-1.

Relations between drug concentration and drug effect (panel A ) or receptor-bound drug (panel B ). The drug concentrations which effect or receptor occupancy is half-maximal are denoted $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ and $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{d}}$, respectively.

This hyperbolic relation resembles the mass action law, which describes association between two molecules of a given affinity. This resemblance suggests that drug agonists act by binding to ("occupying") a distinct class of biologic molecules with a characteristic affinity for the drug receptor. Radioactive receptor ligands have been us to confirm this occupancy assumption in many drug-receptor systems. In these systems, drug bound to receptc (B) relates to the concentration of free (unbound) drug (C) as depicted in Figure 2-1B and as described by an analogous equation:
$B=\frac{B_{\text {max }} \times C}{C+K_{d}}$
in which $\mathrm{B}_{\text {max }}$ indicates the total concentration of receptor sites (ie, sites bound to the drug at infinitely high concentrations of free drug). $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{d}}$ (the equilibrium dissociation constant) represents the concentration of free dru at which half-maximal binding is observed. This constant characterizes the receptor's affinity for binding the dri in a reciprocal fashion: If the $K_{d}$ is low, binding affinity is high, and vice versa. The $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ and $K_{d}$ may be identical
but need not be, as discussed below. Dose-response data are often presented as a plot of the drug effect (ordinate) against the logarithm of the dose or concentration (abscissa). This mathematical maneuver transforr the hyperbolic curve of Figure 2-1 into a sigmoid curve with a linear midportion (eg, Figure 2-2). This expands the scale of the concentration axis at low concentrations (where the effect is changing rapidly) and compresses at high concentrations (where the effect is changing slowly), but has no special biologic or pharmacologic significance.

Logarithmic transformation of the dose axis and experimental demonstration of spare receptors, using different concentratio of an irreversible antagonist. Curve $\mathbf{A}$ shows agonist response in the absence of antagonist. After treatment with a low concentration of antagonist (curve B ), the curve is shifted to the right; maximal responsiveness is preserved, however, because the remaining available receptors are still in excess of the number required. In curve $\mathbf{C}$, produced after treatment $w$ a larger concentration of antagonist, the available receptors are no longer "spare"; instead, they are just sufficient to mediat an undiminished maximal response. Still higher concentrations of antagonist (curves $\mathbf{D}$ and $\mathbf{E}$ ) reduce the number of availak receptors to the point that maximal response is diminished. The apparent $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ of the agonist in curves $\mathbf{D}$ and $\mathbf{E}$ may approximate the $K_{d}$ that characterizes the binding affinity of the agonist for the receptor.

\section*{Receptor-Effector Coupling \& Spare Receptors}

When a receptor is occupied by an agonist, the resulting conformational change is only the first of many steps usually required to produce a pharmacologic response. The transduction process that links drug occupancy of receptors and pharmacologic response is often termed coupling. The relative efficiency of occupancy-response coupling is partially determined by the initial conformational change in the receptor; thus, the effects of full agonists can be considered more efficiently coupled to receptor occupancy than can the effects of partial agonis as described below. Coupling efficiency is also determined by the biochemical events that transduce receptor
occupancy into cellular response. Sometimes the biologic effect of the drug is linearly related to the number of receptors bound. This is often true for drug-regulated ion channels, eg, where the ion current produced by the drug is directly proportional to the number of receptors (ion channels) bound. In other cases the biologic respor is a more complex function of drug binding to receptors. This is often true for receptors linked to enzymatic sigr transduction cascades, eg, where the biologic response often increases disproportionately to the number of receptors occupied by drug.

Many factors can contribute to nonlinear occupancy-response coupling, and often these factors are only partiall: understood. The concept of "spare" receptors, irrespective of the precise biochemical mechanism involved, can help us to think about these effects. Receptors are said to be "spare" for a given pharmacologic response if it is possible to elicit a maximal biologic response at a concentration of agonist that does not result in occupancy of full complement of available receptors. Experimentally, spare receptors may be demonstrated by using irreversible antagonists to prevent binding of agonist to a proportion of available receptors and showing that hị concentrations of agonist can still produce an undiminished maximal response (Figure 2-2). Thus, the same maximal inotropic response of heart muscle to catecholamines can be elicited even under conditions where $90 \%$ of the $B$-adrenoceptors are occupied by a quasi-irreversible antagonist. Accordingly, myocardial cells are said tc contain a large proportion of spare B-adrenoceptors.

How can we account for the phenomenon of spare receptors? In the example of the B-adrenoceptor, receptor activation promotes binding of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to an intermediate signaling protein, and activatio of the signaling intermediate may greatly outlast the agonist-receptor interaction (see the following section on 1 Proteins \& Second Messengers). In such a case, the "spareness" of receptors is temporal . Maximal response cé be elicited by activation of relatively few receptors because the response initiated by an individual ligand-recept binding event persists longer than the binding event itself.

In other cases, where the biochemical mechanism is not understood, we imagine that the receptors might be spare in number. If the concentration or amount of cellular components other than the receptors limits the coupling of receptor occupancy to response, then a maximal response can occur without occupancy of all receptors. Thus, the sensitivity of a cell or tissue to a particular concentration of agonist depends not only on tr affinity of the receptor for binding the agonist (characterized by the $K_{d}$ ) but also on the degree of sparenesstotal number of receptors present compared with the number actually needed to elicit a maximal biologic response.

The concept of spare receptors is very useful clinically because it allows one to think precisely about the effects drug dosage, without needing to consider biochemical details of the signaling response. The $K_{d}$ of the agonistreceptor interaction determines what fraction ( $\mathrm{B} / \mathrm{B}_{\max }$ ) of total receptors will be occupied at a given free concentration (C) of agonist regardless of the receptor concentration:
$\frac{B}{B_{\max }}=\frac{C}{C+K_{d}}$

Imagine a responding cell with four receptors and four effectors. Here the number of effectors does not limit thr maximal response, and the receptors are not spare in number. Consequently, an agonist present at a concentration equal to the $K_{d}$ will occupy $50 \%$ of the receptors, and half of the effectors will be activated, producing a half-maximal response (ie, two receptors stimulate two effectors). Now imagine that the number of receptors increases 10-fold to 40 receptors but that the total number of effectors remains constant. Most of the receptors are now spare in number. As a result, a much lower concentration of agonist suffices to occupy two o
the 40 receptors ( $5 \%$ of the receptors), and this same low concentration of agonist is able to elicit a half-maxin response (two of four effectors activated). Thus, it is possible to change the sensitivity of tissues with spare receptors by changing the receptor concentration.

\section*{Competitive \& I rreversible Antagonists}

Receptor antagonists bind to receptors but do not activate them. The primary action of antagonists is to preven agonists (other drugs or endogenous regulatory molecules) from activating receptors. Some antagonists (socalled "inverse agonists"), also reduce receptor activity below basal levels observed in the absence of bound ligand. Antagonists are divided into two classes depending on whether or not they reversibly compete with agonists for binding to receptors.

In the presence of a fixed concentration of agonist, increasing concentrations of a reversible competitive antagonist progressively inhibit the agonist response; high antagonist concentrations prevent response completely. Conversely, sufficiently high concentrations of agonist can completely surmount the effect of a give concentration of the antagonist; that is, the $\mathrm{E}_{\text {max }}$ for the agonist remains the same for any fixed concentration c antagonist (Figure 2-3A). Because the antagonism is competitive, the presence of antagonist increases the agonist concentration required for a given degree of response, and so the agonist concentration-effect curve is shifted to the right.
Figure 2-3.

Changes in agonist concentration-effect curves produced by a competitive antagonist (Panel A ) or by an irreversible antago। (Panel B ). In the presence of a competitive antagonist, higher concentrations of agonist are required to produce a given eff thus the agonist concentration ( $\mathrm{C}^{\prime}$ ) required for a given effect in the presence of concentration [ 1 ] of an antagonist is shifted the right, as shown. High agonist concentrations can overcome inhibition by a competitive antagonist. This is not the case w an irreversible (or noncompetitive) antagonist, which reduces the maximal effect the agonist can achieve, although it may nc change its $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$.

The concentration ( $\mathrm{C}^{\prime}$ ) of an agonist required to produce a given effect in the presence of a fixed concentration ([I]) of competitive antagonist is greater than the agonist concentration (C) required to produce the same effec in the absence of the antagonist. The ratio of these two agonist concentrations (the "dose ratio") is related to tr dissociation constant ( $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{i}}$ ) of the antagonist by the Schild equation:
$\frac{C^{\prime}}{C}=1+\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}$

Pharmacologists often use this relation to determine the $K_{i}$ of a competitive antagonist. Even without knowledg of the relationship between agonist occupancy of the receptor and response, the $K_{i}$ can be determined simply a accurately. As shown in Figure 2-3, concentration response curves are obtained in the presence and in the absence of a fixed concentration of competitive antagonist; comparison of the agonist concentrations required $t$ produce identical degrees of pharmacologic effect in the two situations reveals the antagonist's $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{i}}$. If $\mathrm{C}^{\prime}$ is twice C, for example, then [I] $=\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{i}}$.

For the clinician, this mathematical relation has two important therapeutic implications:
(1) The degree of inhibition produced by a competitive antagonist depends on the concentration of antagonist. Different patients receiving a fixed dose of propranolol, for example, exhibit a wide range of plasma concentrations, owing to differences in clearance of the drug. As a result, the effects of a fixed dose of this competitive antagonist of norepinephrine may vary widely in patients, and the dose must be adjusted accordin!
(2) Clinical response to a competitive antagonist depends on the concentration of agonist that is competing for binding to receptors. Here also propranolol provides a useful example: When this competitive B-adrenoceptor antagonist is administered in doses sufficient to block the effect of basal levels of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, resting heart rate is decreased. However, the increase in release of norepinephrine and epinephrine that occurs with exercise, postural changes, or emotional stress may suffice to overcome competiti antagonism by propranolol and increase heart rate, and thereby can influence therapeutic response.

Some receptor antagonists bind to the receptor in an irreversible or nearly irreversible fashion, either by form a covalent bond with the receptor or by binding so tightly that, for practical purposes, the receptor is unavailab for binding of agonist. After occupancy of some proportion of receptors by such an antagonist, the number of remaining unoccupied receptors may be too low for the agonist (even at high concentrations) to elicit a respons comparable to the previous maximal response (Figure 2-3B). If spare receptors are present, however, a lower dose of an irreversible antagonist may leave enough receptors unoccupied to allow achievement of maximum response to agonist, although a higher agonist concentration will be required (Figures $2-2 \mathrm{~B}$ and C ; see Receptc Effector Coupling and Spare Receptors, above).

Therapeutically, irreversible antagonists present distinctive advantages and disadvantages. Once the irreversibl antagonist has occupied the receptor, it need not be present in unbound form to inhibit agonist responses. Consequently, the duration of action of such an irreversible antagonist is relatively independent of its own rate elimination and more dependent on the rate of turnover of receptor molecules.

Phenoxybenzamine, an irreversible a
catecholamines released from pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal medulla. If administration of phenoxybenzamine lowers blood pressure, blockade will be maintained even when the tumor episodically releas very large amounts of catecholamine. In this case, the ability to prevent responses to varying and high concentrations of agonist is a therapeutic advantage. If overdose occurs, however, a real problem may arise. If the adrenoceptor blockade cannot be overcome, excess effects of the drug must be antagonized "physiologically," ie, by using a pressor agent that does not act via areceptors.

Antagonists can function noncompetitively in a different way; that is, by binding to a site on the receptor protei separate from the agonist binding site and thereby preventing receptor activation without blocking agonist binding. Although these drugs act noncompetitively, their actions are reversible if they do not bind covalently. Some drugs, often called allosteric modulators, bind to a separate site on the receptor protein and alter recept function without inactivating the receptor. For example, benzodiazepines bind noncompetitively to ion channels activated by the neurotransmitter $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA), enhancing the net activating effect of GABA on channel conductance.

\section*{Partial Agonists}

Based on the maximal pharmacologic response that occurs when all receptors are occupied, agonists can be divided into two classes: partial agonists produce a lower response, at full receptor occupancy, than do full agonists. Partial agonists produce concentration-effect curves that resemble those observed with full agonists the presence of an antagonist that irreversibly blocks some of the receptor sites (compare Figures 2-2 [curve [ and $2-4 \mathrm{~B}$ ). It is important to emphasize that the failure of partial agonists to produce a maximal response is nc due to decreased affinity for binding to receptors. Indeed, a partial agonist's inability to cause a maximal pharmacologic response, even when present at high concentrations that saturate binding to all receptors, is indicated by the fact that partial agonists competitively inhibit the responses produced by full agonists (Figure 2-4C). Many drugs used clinically as antagonists are in fact weak partial agonists.
Figure 2-4.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-0034.jpg?height=1933&width=958&top_left_y=180&top_left_x=635)

Panel A: The percentage of receptor occupancy resulting from full agonist (present at a single concentration) binding to receptors in the presence of increasing concentrations of a partial agonist. Because the full agonist (filled squares) and the partial agonist (open squares) compete to bind to the same receptor sites, when occupancy by the partial agonist increases, binding of the full agonist decreases. Panel B: When each of the two drugs is used alone and response is measured, occupar of all the receptors by the partial agonist produces a lower maximal response than does similar occupancy by the full agonist Panel C: Simultaneous treatment with a single concentration of full agonist and increasing concentrations of the partial agon
produces the response patterns shown in the bottom panel. The fractional response caused by a single high concentration oi the full agonist (filled squares) decreases as increasing concentrations of the partial agonist compete to bind to the receptor with increasing success; at the same time the portion of the response caused by the partial agonist (open squares) increase: while the total response-ie, the sum of responses to the two drugs (filled triangles)-gradually decreases, eventually reachil the value produced by partial agonist alone (compare panel B).

\section*{Other Mechanisms of Drug Antagonism}

Not all of the mechanisms of antagonism involve interactions of drugs or endogenous ligands at a single type of receptor, and some types of antagonism do not involve a receptor at all. For example, protamine, a protein tha positively charged at physiologic pH, can be used clinically to counteract the effects of heparin, an anticoagulan that is negatively charged; in this case, one drug acts as a chemical antagonist of the other simply by ionic binding that makes the other drug unavailable for interactions with proteins involved in blood clotting.

Another type of antagonism is physiologic antagonism between endogenous regulatory pathways mediated $k$ different receptors. For example, several catabolic actions of the glucocorticoid hormones lead to increased bloc sugar, an effect that is physiologically opposed by insulin. Although glucocorticoids and insulin act on quite disti receptor-effector systems, the clinician must sometimes administer insulin to oppose the hyperglycemic effects a glucocorticoid hormone, whether the latter is elevated by endogenous synthesis (eg, a tumor of the adrenal cortex) or as a result of glucocorticoid therapy.

In general, use of a drug as a physiologic antagonist produces effects that are less specific and less easy to control than are the effects of a receptor-specific antagonist. Thus, for example, to treat bradycardia caused by increased release of acetylcholine from vagus nerve endings, the physician could use isoproterenol, a Badrenoceptor agonist that increases heart rate by mimicking sympathetic stimulation of the heart. However, us of this physiologic antagonist would be less rational-and potentially more dangerous-than would use of a receptor-specific antagonist such as atropine (a competitive antagonist at the receptors at which acetylcholine slows heart rate).

\section*{SIGNALI NG MECHANISMS \& DRUG ACTION}

Until now we have considered receptor interactions and drug effects in terms of equations and concentrationeffect curves. We must also understand the molecular mechanisms by which a drug acts. Such understanding allows us to ask basic questions with important clinical implications:
- Why do some drugs produce effects that persist for minutes, hours, or even days after the drug is no longer present?
- Why do responses to other drugs diminish rapidly with prolonged or repeated administration?
- How do cellular mechanisms for amplifying external chemical signals explain the phenomenon of spar. receptors?
- Why do chemically similar drugs often exhibit extraordinary selectivity in their actions?
- Do these mechanisms provide targets for developing new drugs?

Most transmembrane signaling is accomplished by a small number of different molecular mechanisms. Each typ of mechanism has been adapted, through the evolution of distinctive protein families, to transduce many differ signals. These protein families include receptors on the cell surface and within the cell, as well as enzymes and
other components that generate, amplify, coordinate, and terminate postreceptor signaling by chemical second messengers in the cytoplasm. This section first discusses the mechanisms for carrying chemical information across the plasma membrane and then outlines key features of cytoplasmic second messengers.

Five basic mechanisms of transmembrane signaling are well understood (Figure 2-5). Each uses a different strategy to circumvent the barrier posed by the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. These strategies use (1) lipid-soluble ligand that crosses the membrane and acts on an intracellular receptor; (2) a transmembrane receptor protein whose intracellular enzymatic activity is allosterically regulated by a ligand that binds to a site the protein's extracellular domain; (3) a transmembrane receptor that binds and stimulates a protein tyrosine kinase; (4) a ligand-gated transmembrane ion channel that can be induced to open or close by the binding of a ligand; or (5) a transmembrane receptor protein that stimulates a GTP-binding signal transducer protein (G protein), which in turn modulates production of an intracellular second messenger.

Known transmembrane signaling mechanisms: 1: A lipid-soluble chemical signal crosses the plasma membrane and acts on intracellular receptor (which may be an enzyme or a regulator of gene transcription); 2: the signal binds to the extracellular domain of a transmembrane protein, thereby activating an enzymatic activity of its cytoplasmic domain; 3: the signal binds 1 the extracellular domain of a transmembrane receptor bound to a protein tyrosine kinase, which it activates; 4: the signal bi to and directly regulates the opening of an ion channel; 5: the signal binds to a cell-surface receptor linked to an effector enzyme by a G protein. (A, C, substrates; B, D, products; R, receptor; G, G protein; E, effector [enzyme or ion channel]; Y, tyrosine; P, phosphate.)

While the five established mechanisms do not account for all the chemical signals conveyed across cell membranes, they do transduce many of the most important signals exploited in pharmacotherapy.

\section*{Intracellular Receptors for Lipid-Soluble Agents}

Several biologic ligands are sufficiently lipid-soluble to cross the plasma membrane and act on intracellular receptors. One class of such ligands includes steroids (corticosteroids, mineralocorticoids, sex steroids, vitamin
D), and thyroid hormone, whose receptors stimulate the transcription of genes by binding to specific DNA sequences near the gene whose expression is to be regulated. Many of the target DNA sequences (called response elements) have been identified.

These "gene-active" receptors belong to a protein family that evolved from a common precursor. Dissection of 1 receptors by recombinant DNA techniques has provided insights into their molecular mechanism. For example, binding of glucocorticoid hormone to its normal receptor protein relieves an inhibitory constraint on the transcription-stimulating activity of the protein. Figure 2-6 schematically depicts the molecular mechanism of glucocorticoid action: In the absence of hormone, the receptor is bound to hsp90, a protein that appears to prevent normal folding of several structural domains of the receptor. Binding of hormone to the ligand-binding domain triggers release of hsp90. This allows the DNA-binding and transcription-activating domains of the receptor to fold into their functionally active conformations, so that the activated receptor can initiate transcript of target genes.

Mechanism of glucocorticoid action. The glucocorticoid receptor polypeptide is schematically depicted as a protein with three distinct domains. A heat-shock protein, hsp90, binds to the receptor in the absence of hormone and prevents folding into thr
active conformation of the receptor. Binding of a hormone ligand (steroid) causes dissociation of the hsp90 stabilizer and permits conversion to the active configuration.

The mechanism used by hormones that act by regulating gene expression has two therapeutically important consequences:
(1) All of these hormones produce their effects after a characteristic lag period of 30 minutes to several hours-the time required for the synthesis of new proteins. This means that the gene-active hormones cannot I expected to alter a pathologic state within minutes (eg, glucocorticoids will not immediately relieve the sympto of acute bronchial asthma).
(2) The effects of these agents can persist for hours or days after the agonist concentration has been reduced $t$ zero. The persistence of effect is primarily due to the relatively slow turnover of most enzymes and proteins, which can remain active in cells for hours or days after they have been synthesized. Consequently, it means th. the beneficial (or toxic) effects of a gene-active hormone will usually decrease slowly when administration of th hormone is stopped.

\section*{Ligand-Regulated Transmembrane Enzymes I ncluding Receptor Tyrosine Kinases}

This class of receptor molecules mediates the first steps in signaling by insulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), transforming growth factor-B (TGF-B), a many other trophic hormones. These receptors are polypeptides consisting of an extracellular hormone-binding domain and a cytoplasmic enzyme domain, which may be a protein tyrosine kinase, a serine kinase, or a guany cyclase (Figure 2-7). In all these receptors, the two domains are connected by a hydrophobic segment of the polypeptide that crosses the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane.
Figure 2-7.

Mechanism of activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, a representative receptor tyrosine kinase. The recep polypeptide has extracellular and cytoplasmic domains, depicted above and below the plasma membrane. Upon binding of E( (circle), the receptor converts from its inactive monomeric state (left) to an active dimeric state (right), in which two receptc polypeptides bind noncovalently. The cytoplasmic domains become phosphorylated ( P ) on specific tyrosine residues ( Y ) and their enzymatic activities are activated, catalyzing phosphorylation of substrate proteins (S).

The receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway begins with binding of ligand, typically a polypeptide hormone o growth factor, to the receptor's extracellular domain. The resulting change in receptor conformation causes receptor molecules to bind to one another, which in turn brings together the tyrosine kinase domains, which become enzymatically active, and phosphorylate one another as well as additional downstream signaling protei। Activated receptors catalyze phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on different target signaling proteins, thereby allowing a single type of activated receptor to modulate a number of biochemical processes.

Insulin, for example, uses a single class of receptors to trigger increased uptake of glucose and amino acids, ar to regulate metabolism of glycogen and triglycerides in the cell. Similarly, each of the growth factors initiates in specific target cells a complex program of cellular events ranging from altered membrane transport of ions and metabolites to changes in the expression of many genes. Inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases are finding increased use in neoplastic disorders where excessive growth factor signaling is often involved. Some of these inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies (eg, trastuzumab, cetuximab), which bind to the extracellular domain of a particular receptor and interfere with binding of growth factor. Other inhibitors are membrane-permeant "small molecule" chemicals (eg, gefitinib, erlotinib), which inhibit the receptor's kinase activity in the cytoplasm.

The intensity and duration of action of EGF, PDGF, and other agents that act via receptor tyrosine kinases are limited by a process called receptor down-regulation. Ligand binding often induces accelerated endocytosis of receptors from the cell surface, followed by the degradation of those receptors (and their bound ligands). Wher this process occurs at a rate faster than de novo synthesis of receptors, the total number of cell-surface receptı is reduced (down-regulated) and the cell's responsiveness to ligand is correspondingly diminished. A well-
understood example is the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase, which undergoes rapid endocytosis and is trafficked tc lysosomes after EGF binding; genetic mutations that interfere with this process cause excessive growth factor-induced cell proliferation and are associated with an increased susceptibility to certain types of cancer. Endocytosis of other receptor tyrosine kinases, most notably receptors for nerve growth factor, serves a very different function. Internalized nerve growth factor receptors are not rapidly degraded and are translocated in endocytic vesicles from the distal axon, where receptors are activated by nerve growth factor released from the innervated tissue, to the cell body. In the cell body the growth factor signal is transduced to transcription factor regulating the expression of genes controlling cell survival. This process effectively transports a critical survival signal from its site of release to its site of signaling effect, and does so over a remarkably long distance-more than 1 meter in certain sensory neurons. A number of regulators of growth and differentiation, including TGF-B, act on another class of transmembrane receptor enzymes that phosphorylate serine and threonine residues. AN an important regulator of blood volume and vascular tone, acts on a transmembrane receptor whose intracellul domain, a guanylyl cyclase, generates cGMP (see below). Receptors in both groups, like the receptor tyrosine kinases, are active in their dimeric forms.

\section*{Cytokine Receptors}

Cytokine receptors respond to a heterogeneous group of peptide ligands that includes growth hormone, erythropoietin, several kinds of interferon, and other regulators of growth and differentiation. These receptors $\iota$ a mechanism (Figure 2-8) closely resembling that of receptor tyrosine kinases, except that in this case, the protein tyrosine kinase activity is not intrinsic to the receptor molecule. Instead, a separate protein tyrosine kinase, from the Janus-kinase (JAK) family, binds noncovalently to the receptor. As in the case of the EGFreceptor, cytokine receptors dimerize after they bind the activating ligand, allowing the bound JAKs to become activated and to phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptor. Tyrosine phosphates on the receptor then set motion a complex signaling dance by binding another set of proteins, called STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription). The bound STATs are themselves phosphorylated by the JAKs, two STAT molecules dimerize (attaching to one another's tyrosine phosphates), and finally the STAT/STAT dimer dissociates from th receptor and travels to the nucleus, where it regulates transcription of specific genes.
Figure 2-8.

Cytokine receptors, like receptor tyrosine kinases, have extracellular and intracellular domains and form dimers. However, a activation by an appropriate ligand, separate mobile protein tyrosine kinase molecules (JAK) are activated, resulting in phosphorylation of signal transducers and activation of transcription (STAT) molecules. STAT dimers then travel to the nucle where they regulate transcription.

\section*{Ligand-Gated Channels}

Many of the most useful drugs in clinical medicine act by mimicking or blocking the actions of endogenous ligan that regulate the flow of ions through plasma membrane channels. The natural ligands include acetylcholine, serotonin, GABA, and glutamate. All of these agents are synaptic transmitters.

Each of their receptors transmits its signal across the plasma membrane by increasing transmembrane conductance of the relevant ion and thereby altering the electrical potential across the membrane. For example acetylcholine causes the opening of the ion channel in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), which allows $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to flow down its concentration gradient into cells, producing a localized excitatory postsynaptic potential-a depolarization.

The AChR (Figure 2-9) is one of the best-characterized of all cell-surface receptors for hormones or neurotransmitters. One form of this receptor is a pentamer made up of four polypeptide subunits (eg, two a.cha plus one $B$, one $\gamma$, and one $\delta$ chain, all with molecular weights ranging from 43,000 to 50,000 ). These polypeptides, each of which crosses the lipid bilayer four times, form a cylindric structure 8 nm in diameter. Wh acetylcholine binds to sites on the asubunits, a conformational change occurs that results in the transient openi of a central aqueous channel through which sodium ions penetrate from the extracellular fluid into the cell.
Figure 2-9.

The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel. The receptor molecule is depicted as embedded in a rectangular piece of plasma membrane, with extracellular fluid above and cytoplasm below. Composed of five subunits (two one $B$, one $\gamma$, and one $\delta$ ), the receptor opens a central transmembrane ion channel when acetylcholine (ACh) binds to sites the extracellular domain of its asubunits.

The time elapsed between the binding of the agonist to a ligand-gated channel and the cellular response can of be measured in milliseconds. The rapidity of this signaling mechanism is crucially important for moment-tomoment transfer of information across synapses. Ligand-gated ion channels can be regulated by multiple mechanisms, including phosphorylation and endocytosis. In the central nervous system, these mechanisms contribute to synaptic plasticity involved in learning and memory.

\section*{G Proteins \& Second Messengers}

Many extracellular ligands act by increasing the intracellular concentrations of second messengers such as cycli adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), calcium ion, or the phosphoinositides (described below). In most case they use a transmembrane signaling system with three separate components. First, the extracellular ligand is specifically detected by a cell-surface receptor. The receptor in turn triggers the activation of a G protein locate on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. The activated G protein then changes the activity of an effec element, usually an enzyme or ion channel. This element then changes the concentration of the intracellular second messenger. For cAMP, the effector enzyme is adenylyl cyclase, a membrane protein that converts intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cAMP. The corresponding G protein, $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$, stimulates adenylyl cycla: after being activated by hormones and neurotransmitters that act via specific $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$-coupled receptors. There are many examples of such receptors including $B$-adrenoceptors, glucagon receptors, thyrotropin receptors, and certain subtypes of dopamine and serotonin receptors.
$\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$ and other G proteins use a molecular mechanism that involves binding and hydrolysis of GTP (Figure 2-10).

This mechanism allows the transduced signal to be amplified. For example, a neurotransmitter such as norepinephrine may encounter its membrane receptor for only a few milliseconds. When the encounter generat a GTP-bound $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$ molecule, however, the duration of activation of adenylyl cyclase depends on the longevity of C binding to $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$ rather than on the receptor's affinity for norepinephrine. Indeed, like other G proteins, GTP-bound $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$ may remain active for tens of seconds, enormously amplifying the original signal. This mechanism also helps explain how signaling by G proteins produces the phenomenon of spare receptors (described above). The famil! of $G$ proteins contains several functionally diverse subfamilies (Table 2-1), each of which mediates effects of a particular set of receptors to a distinctive group of effectors. Note that an endogenous ligand (eg, norepinephrir acetylcholine, serotonin, many others not listed in Table 2-1) may bind and stimulate receptors that couple to different subsets of G proteins. The apparent promiscuity of such a ligand allows it to elicit different G proteindependent responses in different cells. For instance, the body responds to danger by using catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine) both to increase heart rate and to induce constriction of blood vessels in the skin, by acting on $G_{s}$ - coupled $B$-adrenoceptors and $G_{q}$ - coupled $\alpha_{1}$-adrenoceptors, respectively. Ligand promiscuity also offers opportunities in drug development (see Receptor Classes \& Drug Development, below).

The guanine nucleotide-dependent activation-inactivation cycle of G proteins. The agonist activates the receptor (R $\rightarrow$ R*), wh promotes release of GDP from the G protein (G), allowing entry of GTP into the nucleotide binding site. In its GTP-bound sta (G-GTP), the G protein regulates activity of an effector enzyme or ion channel (E). The signal is terminated by hydrolysis of GTP, followed by return of the system to the basal unstimulated state. Open arrows denote regulatory effects. ( $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate.)

Receptors coupled to G proteins comprise a family of "seven-transmembrane" (7-TM) or "serpentine" receptors so called because the receptor polypeptide chain "snakes" across the plasma membrane seven times (Figure 2-11). Receptors for adrenergic amines, serotonin, acetylcholine (muscarinic but not nicotinic), many peptide hormones, odorants, and even visual receptors (in retinal rod and cone cells) all belong to the serpentine famil) All were derived from a common evolutionary precursor. Several serpentine receptors exist as dimers or larger complexes. Serpentine receptors signal by a different mechanism than receptor tyrosine kinases and cytokine
receptors, however, and it is thought that dimerization is not essential for activation of many serpentine receptors.

Transmembrane topology of a typical serpentine receptor. The receptor's amino ( N ) terminal is extracellular (above the plan the membrane), and its carboxyl (C) terminal intracellular. The terminals are connected by a polypeptide chain that traverse the plane of the membrane seven times. The hydrophobic transmembrane segments (light color) are designated by roman numerals (I-VII). The agonist (Ag) approaches the receptor from the extracellular fluid and binds to a site surrounded by th transmembrane regions of the receptor protein. G proteins interact with cytoplasmic regions of the receptor, especially with portions of the third cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane regions V and VI. The receptor's cytoplasmic terminal tail contains numerous serine and threonine residues whose hydroxyl (-OH) groups can be phosphorylated. This phosphorylatio may be associated with diminished receptor-G protein interaction.

All serpentine receptors transduce signals across the plasma membrane in essentially the same way. Often the agonist ligand-eg, a catecholamine, acetylcholine, or the photon-activated chromophore of retinal photoreceptors-is bound in a pocket enclosed by the transmembrane regions of the receptor (as in Figure 2-1 The resulting change in conformation of these regions is transmitted to cytoplasmic loops of the receptor, whick turn activate the appropriate G protein by promoting replacement of GDP by GTP, as described above. Amino acids in the third cytoplasmic loop of the serpentine receptor polypeptide are generally thought to play a key ro in mediating receptor interaction with $G$ proteins (shown by arrows in Figure 2-11).

\section*{Receptor Regulation}

G protein-mediated responses to drugs and hormonal agonists often attenuate with time (Figure 2-12, top). Af reaching an initial high level, the response (eg, cellular cAMP accumulation, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$influx, contractility, etc) diminishes over seconds or minutes, even in the continued presence of the agonist. This "desensitization" is oft, rapidly reversible; a second exposure to agonist, if provided a few minutes after termination of the first exposu। results in a response similar to the initial response.

Rapid desensitization and longer-term down-regulation of B-adrenoceptors. Panel A: Response to a B-adrenoceptor agonist (ordinate) versus time (abscissa). Temporal duration of exposure to a constant concentration of agonist is indicated by the light-colored bar. The break in the time axis indicates passage of time in the absence of agonist. Desensitization refers to the reduced cAMP response after several minutes in the continued presence of agonist; restored response is observed after a br period (typically several more minutes) in the absence of agonist. Panel B: Agonist-induced phosphorylation (P) by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) of carboxyl terminal hydroxyl groups (-OH) of the $\bar{B}$-adrenoceptor. This phosphorylation induces binding of a protein, $B$-arrestin ( $B$-arr), which prevents the receptor from interacting with $G_{s}$. Removal of agonist for a short period of time (on the order of several minutes) allows dissociation of B-arr, removal of phosphate (Pi) from the receptor by phosphatases (P'ase), and restoration of the receptor's normal responsiveness to agoni! Panel C: Agonist-induced endocytosis and endocytic membrane trafficking of receptors. Beta-arrestin promotes receptor binding to endocytotic structures in the plasma membrane called coated pits. After short-term agonist exposure, receptors primarily undergo dephosphorylation by phosphatases (P'ase) and recycling, promoting rapid recovery of signaling responsiveness. After longer-term agonist exposure, receptors that have undergone endocytosis traffic to lysosomes, promoting the process of receptor down-regulation.

The mechanism mediating rapid desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors often involves receptor phosphorylation, as illustrated by rapid desensitization of the B-adrenoceptor (Figure 2-12, top). The agonistinduced change in conformation of the receptor causes it to bind, activate, and serve as a substrate for a family specific receptor kinases, called G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). The activated GRK then phosphorylates serine residues in the receptor's carboxyl terminal tail. The presence of phosphoserines increasi the receptor's affinity for binding a third protein, $\beta$-arrestin. Binding of $\beta$-arrestin to cytoplasmic loops of the receptor diminishes the receptor's ability to interact with $G_{s}$, thereby reducing the agonist response (ie, stimulation of adenylyl cyclase). Upon removal of agonist, GRK activation is terminated and the desensitization process can be reversed by cellular phosphatases.

For the $B$-adrenoceptor, and many other serpentine receptors, $B$-arrestin binding also accelerates endocytosis c receptors from the plasma membrane. Endocytosis of receptors promotes their dephosphorylation, by a recept، phosphatase that is present at high concentration on endosome membranes, and receptors then return to the plasma membrane. This helps explain the ability of cells to recover receptor-mediated signaling responsiveness very efficiently after agonist-induced desensitization. Several serpentine receptors-including the B -adrenoceptı if it is persistently activated-instead traffic to lysosomes after endocytosis and are degraded. This process effectively attenuates (rather than restores) cellular responsiveness, similar to the process of down-regulation described above for the epidermal growth factor receptor. Thus, depending on the particular receptor and duration of activation, endocytosis can contribute to either rapid recovery or prolonged attenuation of cellular responsiveness (Figure 2-12).

\section*{Well-Established Second Messengers CYCLIC ADENOSINE MONOPHOSPHATE (CAMP)}

Acting as an intracellular second messenger, cAMP mediates such hormonal responses as the mobilization of stored energy (the breakdown of carbohydrates in liver or triglycerides in fat cells stimulated by B-adrenomime catecholamines), conservation of water by the kidney (mediated by vasopressin), $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ homeostasis (regulated parathyroid hormone), and increased rate and contractile force of heart muscle (B-adrenomimetic catecholamines). It also regulates the production of adrenal and sex steroids (in response to corticotropin or follicle-stimulating hormone), relaxation of smooth muscle, and many other endocrine and neural processes.
cAMP exerts most of its effects by stimulating cAMP-dependent protein kinases (Figure 2-13). These kinases ar composed of a cAMP-binding regulatory (R) dimer and two catalytic (C) chains. When cAMP binds to the R dime active C chains are released to diffuse through the cytoplasm and nucleus, where they transfer phosphate from ATP to appropriate substrate proteins, often enzymes. The specificity of cAMP's regulatory effects resides in the distinct protein substrates of the kinases that are expressed in different cells. For example, liver is rich in phosphorylase kinase and glycogen synthase, enzymes whose reciprocal regulation by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation governs carbohydrate storage and release.
Figure 2-13.

The cAMP second messenger pathway. Key proteins include hormone receptors (Rec), a stimulatory G protein (Gs), catalytic adenylyl cyclase (AC), phosphodiesterases (PDE) that hydrolyze cAMP, cAMP-dependent kinases, with regulatory (R) and catalytic (C) subunits, protein substrates (S) of the kinases, and phosphatases (P'ase), which remove phosphates from substrate proteins. Open arrows denote regulatory effects.

When the hormonal stimulus stops, the intracellular actions of cAMP are terminated by an elaborate series of enzymes. cAMP-stimulated phosphorylation of enzyme substrates is rapidly reversed by a diverse group of spec and nonspecific phosphatases. cAMP itself is degraded to 5'-AMP by several cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterast (PDE, Figure 2-13). Competitive inhibition of cAMP degradation is one way caffeine, theophylline, and other methylxanthines produce their effects (see Chapter 20).

\section*{CALCIUM AND PHOSPHOINOSITIDES}

Another well-studied second messenger system involves hormonal stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis (Figure 2-14). Some of the hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors that trigger this pathway bind to receptors linked to G proteins, while others bind to receptor tyrosine kinases. In all cases, the crucial step is stimulation of a membrane enzyme, phospholipase C (PLC), which splits a minor phospholipid component of the plasma membrane, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), into two second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3 or InsP ${ }_{3}$ ). Diacylglycerol is confined to the membrane where it activates a phospholipid- and calcium-sensitive protein kinase called protein kinase C. IP ${ }_{3}$ is water-soluble and diffuses through the cytoplasm to trigger release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from internal storage vesicles. Elevated cytoplasmic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration promotes the binding of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to the calcium-binding protein calmodulin, which regulates activities of other enzymes, including calcium-dependent protein kinases.

Figure 2-14.

The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-phosphoinositide signaling pathway. Key proteins include hormone receptors (R), a G protein (G), a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C substrates of the kinase (S), calmodulin (CaM), and calmodulin-binding enzymes (E), including kinases, phosphodiesterases, etc. (PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; IP 3 , inositol trisphosphate. Asterisk denotes activated state. Open arrows denote regulatory effects.)

With its multiple second messengers and protein kinases, the phosphoinositide signaling pathway is much more complex than the cAMP pathway. For example, different cell types may contain one or more specialized calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinases with limited substrate specificity (eg, myosin light chain kinase) in addition $t$ general calcium- and calmodulin-dependent kinase that can phosphorylate a wide variety of protein substrates. Furthermore, at least nine structurally distinct types of protein kinase C have been identified.

As in the cAMP system, multiple mechanisms damp or terminate signaling by this pathway. I $P_{3}$ is inactivated by dephosphorylation; diacylglycerol is either phosphorylated to yield phosphatidic acid, which is then converted bi into phospholipids, or it is deacylated to yield arachidonic acid; $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is actively removed from the cytoplasm by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ pumps.

These and other nonreceptor elements of the calcium-phosphoinositide signaling pathway are now becoming targets for drug development. For example, the therapeutic effects of lithium ion, an established agent for treating manic-depressive disorder, may be mediated by effects on the metabolism of phosphoinositides (see Chapter 29).

\section*{CYCLIC GUANOSINE MONOPHOSPHATE (CGMP)}

Unlike cAMP, the ubiquitous and versatile carrier of diverse messages, cGMP has established signaling roles in only a few cell types. In intestinal mucosa and vascular smooth muscle, the cGMP-based signal transduction mechanism closely parallels the cAMP-mediated signaling mechanism. Ligands detected by cell surface receptor stimulate membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP, and cGMP acts by stimulating a cGMP-depender
protein kinase. The actions of cGMP in these cells are terminated by enzymatic degradation of the cyclic nucleotide and by dephosphorylation of kinase substrates.

Increased cGMP concentration causes relaxation of vascular smooth muscle by a kinase-mediated mechanism t results in dephosphorylation of myosin light chains (Figure 12-2 ). In these smooth muscle cells, cGMP synthes can be elevated by two different transmembrane signaling mechanisms utilizing two different guanylyl cyclases. Atrial natriuretic peptide, a blood-borne peptide hormone, stimulates a transmembrane receptor by binding to i extracellular domain, thereby activating the guanylyl cyclase activity that resides in the receptor's intracellular domain. The other mechanism mediates responses to nitric oxide (NO; see Chapter 19), which is generated in vascular endothelial cells in response to natural vasodilator agents such as acetylcholine and histamine. After entering the target cell, NO binds to and activates a cytoplasmic guanylyl cyclase. A number of useful vasodilati drugs, such as nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside used in treating cardiac ischemia and acute hypertension act by generating or mimicking NO. Other drugs produce vasodilation by inhibiting specific phosphodiesterases, thereby interfering with the metabolic breakdown of cGMP. One such drug is sildenafil, used in treating erectile dysfunction (see Chapter 12).

\section*{Interplay among Signaling Mechanisms}

The calcium-phosphoinositide and cAMP signaling pathways oppose one another in some cells and are complementary in others. For example, vasopressor agents that contract smooth muscle act by IP3-mediated mobilization of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, whereas agents that relax smooth muscle often act by elevation of cAMP. In contrast, cAr and phosphoinositide second messengers act together to stimulate glucose release from the liver.

\section*{Phosphorylation: A Common Theme}

Almost all second messenger signaling involves reversible phosphorylation, which performs two principal functic in signaling: amplification and flexible regulation. In amplification, rather like GTP bound to a G protein, the attachment of a phosphoryl group to a serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue powerfully amplifies the initial regulatory signal by recording a molecular memory that the pathway has been activated; dephosphorylation erases the memory, taking a longer time to do so than is required for dissociation of an allosteric ligand. In flexible regulation, differing substrate specificities of the multiple protein kinases regulated by second messengers provide branch points in signaling pathways that may be independently regulated. In this way, cAN $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, or other second messengers can use the presence or absence of particular kinases or kinase substrates produce quite different effects in different cell types. Inhibitors of protein kinases have great potential as therapeutic agents, particularly in neoplastic diseases. Trastuzumab, an antibody that antagonizes growth factc receptor signaling, was discussed earlier and is a useful therapeutic agent for breast cancer. Another example c this general approach is imatinib, a small molecule inhibitor of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Abl, which is activated by growth factor signaling pathways. Imatinib appears to be very effective for treating chronic myelogenous leukemia, which is caused by a chromosomal translocation event that produces an active Bcr/Abl fusion protein in hematopoietic cells.

\section*{RECEPTOR CLASSES \& DRUG DEVELOPMENT}

The existence of a specific drug receptor is usually inferred from studying the structure-activity relationship a group of structurally similar congeners of the drug that mimic or antagonize its effects. Thus, if a series of related agonists exhibits identical relative potencies in producing two distinct effects, it is likely that the two effects are mediated by similar or identical receptor molecules. In addition, if identical receptors mediate both
effects, a competitive antagonist will inhibit both responses with the same $K_{i}$; a second competitive antagonist will inhibit both responses with its own characteristic $K_{i}$. Thus, studies of the relation between structure and activity of a series of agonists and antagonists can identify a species of receptor that mediates a set of pharmacologic responses.

Exactly the same experimental procedure can show that observed effects of a drug are mediated by different receptors. In this case, effects mediated by different receptors may exhibit different orders of potency among agonists and different $K_{i}$ values for each competitive antagonist.

Wherever we look, evolution has created many different receptors that function to mediate responses to any individual chemical signal. In some cases, the same chemical acts on completely different structural receptor classes. For example, acetylcholine uses ligand-gated ion channels (nicotinic AChRs) to initiate a fast excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in postganglionic neurons. Acetylcholine also activates a separate class of G prote coupled receptors (muscarinic AChRs), which modulate responsiveness of the same neurons to the fast EPSP. I addition, each structural class usually includes multiple subtypes of receptor, often with significantly different signaling or regulatory properties. For example, many biogenic amines (eg, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and serotonin) activate more than one receptor, each of which may activate a different G protein, as described abo (see also Table 2-1). The existence of multiple receptor classes and subtypes for the same endogenous ligand I created important opportunities for drug development. For example, propranolol, a selective antagonist of Badrenoceptors, can reduce an accelerated heart rate without preventing the sympathetic nervous system from causing vasoconstriction, an effect mediated by $Q_{1}$ receptors.

The principle of drug selectivity may even apply to structurally identical receptors expressed in different cells, e receptors for steroids such as estrogen (Figure 2-6). Different cell types express different accessory proteins, which interact with steroid receptors and change the functional effects of drug-receptor interaction. For exampl tamoxifen acts as an antagonist on estrogen receptors expressed in mammary tissue but as an agonist on estrogen receptors in bone. Consequently, tamoxifen may be useful not only in the treatment and prophylaxis c breast cancer but also in the prevention of osteoporosis by increasing bone density (see Chapters 40 and 42). Tamoxifen may also create complications in postmenopausal women, however, by exerting an agonist action in the uterus, stimulating endometrial cell proliferation.

New drug development is not confined to agents that act on receptors for extracellular chemical signals. Pharmaceutical chemists are now determining whether elements of signaling pathways distal to the receptors $n$ also serve as targets of selective and useful drugs. For example, clinically useful agents might be developed the act selectively on specific G proteins, kinases, phosphatases, or the enzymes that degrade second messengers.

\section*{RELATION BETWEEN DRUG DOSE \& CLI NI CAL RESPONSE}

We have dealt with receptors as molecules and shown how receptors can quantitatively account for the relation between dose or concentration of a drug and pharmacologic responses, at least in an idealized system. When faced with a patient who needs treatment, the prescriber must make a choice among a variety of possible drug and devise a dosage regimen that is likely to produce maximal benefit and minimal toxicity. In order to make rational therapeutic decisions, the prescriber must understand how drug-receptor interactions underlie the relations between dose and response in patients, the nature and causes of variation in pharmacologic responsiveness, and the clinical implications of selectivity of drug action.

\section*{Dose \& Response in Patients}

\section*{GRADED DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONS}

To choose among drugs and to determine appropriate doses of a drug, the prescriber must know the relative pharmacologic potency and maximal efficacy of the drugs in relation to the desired therapeutic effect. The: two important terms, often confusing to students and clinicians, can be explained by referring to Figure 2-15, which depicts graded dose-response curves that relate dose of four different drugs to the magnitude of a particular therapeutic effect.
Figure 2-15.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-0053.jpg?height=811&width=887&top_left_y=592&top_left_x=673)

Graded dose-response curves for four drugs, illustrating different pharmacologic potencies and different maximal efficacies. (See text.)

\section*{Potency}

Drugs A and B are said to be more potent than drugs C and D because of the relative positions of their doseresponse curves along the dose axis of Figure 2-15. Potency refers to the concentration ( $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ ) or dose ( $\mathrm{ED}_{50}$ of a drug required to produce $50 \%$ of that drug's maximal effect. Thus, the pharmacologic potency of drug A in Figure 2-15 is less than that of drug B , a partial agonist, because the $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ of A is greater than the $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ of B . Potency of a drug depends in part on the affinity ( $K_{d}$ ) of receptors for binding the drug and in part on the efficiency with which drug-receptor interaction is coupled to response. Note that some doses of drug A can produce larger effects than any dose of drug B, despite the fact that we describe drug B as pharmacologically more potent. The reason for this is that drug A has a larger maximal efficacy, as described below.

For clinical use, it is important to distinguish between a drug's potency and its efficacy. The clinical effectivenes of a drug depends not on its potency ( $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ ), but on its maximal efficacy (see below) and its ability to reach the relevant receptors. This ability can depend on its route of administration, absorption, distribution through the body, and clearance from the blood or site of action. In deciding which of two drugs to administer to a patient, prescriber must usually consider their relative effectiveness rather than their relative potency. Pharmacologic
potency can largely determine the administered dose of the chosen drug.
For therapeutic purposes, the potency of a drug should be stated in dosage units, usually in terms of a particula therapeutic end point (eg, 50 mg for mild sedation, $1 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ for an increase in heart rate of 25 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$ Relative potency, the ratio of equi-effective doses ( $0.2,10$, etc), may be used in comparing one drug with another.

\section*{Maximal Efficacy}

This parameter reflects the limit of the dose-response relation on the response axis. Drugs $A, C$, and $D$ in Figl 2-15 have equal maximal efficacy, while all have greater maximal efficacy than drug B. The maximal efficacy (sometimes referred to simply as efficacy) of a drug is obviously crucial for making clinical decisions when a lars response is needed. It may be determined by the drug's mode of interactions with receptors (as with partial agonists, described above)* or by characteristics of the receptor-effector system involved.

Thus, diuretics that act on one portion of the nephron may produce much greater excretion of fluid and electrolytes than diuretics that act elsewhere. In addition, the practical efficacy of a drug for achieving a therapeutic end point (eg, increased cardiac contractility) may be limited by the drug's propensity to cause a to effect (eg, fatal cardiac arrhythmia) even if the drug could otherwise produce a greater therapeutic effect.
* Note that "maximal efficacy," used in a therapeutic context, does not have exactly the same meaning the tern denotes in the more specialized context of drug-receptor interactions described earlier in this chapter. In an idealized in vitro system, efficacy denotes the relative maximal efficacy of agonists and partial agonists that act via the same receptor. In therapeutics, efficacy denotes the extent or degree of an effect that can be achieved the intact patient. Thus, therapeutic efficacy may be affected by the characteristics of a particular drug-recepto interaction, but it also depends on a host of other factors as noted in the text.

\section*{SHAPE OF DOSE-RESPONSE CURVES}

While the responses depicted in curves A, B, and C of Figure 2-15 approximate the shape of a simple Michaelis. Menten relation (transformed to a logarithmic plot), some clinical responses do not. Extremely steep doseresponse curves (eg, curve D) may have important clinical consequences if the upper portion of the curve represents an undesirable extent of response (eg, coma caused by a sedative-hypnotic). Steep dose-response curves in patients can result from cooperative interactions of several different actions of a drug (eg, effects on brain, heart, and peripheral vessels, all contributing to lowering of blood pressure).

\section*{QUANTAL DOSE-EFFECT CURVES}

Graded dose-response curves of the sort described above have certain limitations in their application to clinical decision making. For example, such curves may be impossible to construct if the pharmacologic response is an either-or (quantal) event, such as prevention of convulsions, arrhythmia, or death. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of a quantitative dose-response relationship in a single patient, no matter how precisely defined, mas be limited in application to other patients, owing to the great potential variability among patients in severity of disease and responsiveness to drugs.

Some of these difficulties may be avoided by determining the dose of drug required to produce a specified magnitude of effect in a large number of individual patients or experimental animals and plotting the cumulativi frequency distribution of responders versus the log dose (Figure 2-16). The specified quantal effect may be chosen on the basis of clinical relevance (eg, relief of headache) or for preservation of safety of experimental subjects (eg, using low doses of a cardiac stimulant and specifying an increase in heart rate of 20 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$ as the quantal effect), or it may be an inherently quantal event (eg, death of an experimental animal). For most
drugs, the doses required to produce a specified quantal effect in individuals are lognormally distributed; that is frequency distribution of such responses plotted against the log of the dose produces a gaussian normal curve ( variation (colored area, Figure 2-16). When these responses are summated, the resulting cumulative frequenc! distribution constitutes a quantal dose-effect curve (or dose-percent curve) of the proportion or percentage of individuals who exhibit the effect plotted as a function of log dose (Figure 2-16).
Figure 2-16.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_20_5077f6d5de5c97219fafg-0055.jpg?height=936&width=920&top_left_y=540&top_left_x=654)

Quantal dose-effect plots. Shaded boxes (and the accompanying black curves) indicate the frequency distribution of doses 0 . drug required to produce a specified effect; that is, the percentage of animals that required a particular dose to exhibit the effect. The open boxes (and the corresponding colored curves) indicate the cumulative frequency distribution of responses, which are lognormally distributed.

The quantal dose-effect curve is often characterized by stating the median effective dose ( $\mathbf{E D}_{\mathbf{5 0}}$ ), the dose $i$ which $50 \%$ of individuals exhibit the specified quantal effect. (Note that the abbreviation $\mathrm{ED}_{50}$ has a different meaning in this context from its meaning in relation to graded dose-effect curves, described above.) Similarly, dose required to produce a particular toxic effect in $50 \%$ of animals is called the median toxic dose (TD $\mathbf{5 0}$ ). I the toxic effect is death of the animal, a median lethal dose ( $\mathbf{L} \mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{5 0}}$ ) may be experimentally defined. Such values provide a convenient way of comparing the potencies of drugs in experimental and clinical settings: Thus the $\mathrm{ED}_{50} \mathrm{~s}$ of two drugs for producing a specified quantal effect are 5 and 500 mg , respectively, then the first drug can be said to be 100 times more potent than the second for that particular effect. Similarly, one can obta a valuable index of the selectivity of a drug's action by comparing its ED50s for two different quantal effects in a population (eg, cough suppression versus sedation for opioid drugs).

Quantal dose-effect curves may also be used to generate information regarding the margin of safety to be
expected from a particular drug used to produce a specified effect. One measure, which relates the dose of a di required to produce a desired effect to that which produces an undesired effect, is the therapeutic index. In animal studies, the therapeutic index is usually defined as the ratio of the $\mathrm{TD}_{50}$ to the $\mathrm{ED}_{50}$ for some therapeutically relevant effect. The precision possible in animal experiments may make it useful to use such a therapeutic index to estimate the potential benefit of a drug in humans. Of course, the therapeutic index of a d/ in humans is almost never known with real precision; instead, drug trials and accumulated clinical experience often reveal a range of usually effective doses and a different (but sometimes overlapping) range of possibly to doses. The clinically acceptable risk of toxicity depends critically on the severity of the disease being treated. Fc example, the dose range that provides relief from an ordinary headache in the great majority of patients shoulc be very much lower than the dose range that produces serious toxicity, even if the toxicity occurs in a small minority of patients. However, for treatment of a lethal disease such as Hodgkin's lymphoma, the acceptable difference between therapeutic and toxic doses may be smaller.

Finally, note that the quantal dose-effect curve and the graded dose-response curve summarize somewhat different sets of information, although both appear sigmoid in shape on a semilogarithmic plot (compare Figure: 2-15 and 2-16). Critical information required for making rational therapeutic decisions can be obtained from ec type of curve. Both curves provide information regarding the potency and selectivity of drugs; the graded do: response curve indicates the maximal efficacy of a drug, and the quantal dose-effect curve indicates the potential variability of responsiveness among individuals.

\section*{Variation in Drug Responsiveness}

Individuals may vary considerably in their responsiveness to a drug; indeed, a single individual may respond differently to the same drug at different times during the course of treatment. Occasionally, individuals exhibit i unusual or idiosyncratic drug response, one that is infrequently observed in most patients. The idiosyncratic responses are usually caused by genetic differences in metabolism of the drug or by immunologic mechanisms, including allergic reactions.

Quantitative variations in drug response are in general more common and more clinically important. An individu patient is hyporeactive or hyperreactive to a drug in that the intensity of effect of a given dose of drug is diminished or increased in comparison to the effect seen in most individuals. (Note: The term hypersensitivit usually refers to allergic or other immunologic responses to drugs.) With some drugs, the intensity of response a given dose may change during the course of therapy; in these cases, responsiveness usually decreases as a consequence of continued drug administration, producing a state of relative tolerance to the drug's effects. When responsiveness diminishes rapidly after administration of a drug, the response is said to be subject to tachyphylaxis.

Even before administering the first dose of a drug, the prescriber should consider factors that may help in predicting the direction and extent of possible variations in responsiveness. These include the propensity of a particular drug to produce tolerance or tachyphylaxis as well as the effects of age, sex, body size, disease state genetic factors, and simultaneous administration of other drugs.

Four general mechanisms may contribute to variation in drug responsiveness among patients or within an individual patient at different times.

\section*{ALTERATION IN CONCENTRATION OF DRUG THAT REACHES THE RECEPTOR}

Patients may differ in the rate of absorption of a drug, in distributing it through body compartments, or in cleari the drug from the blood (see Chapter 3). By altering the concentration of drug that reaches relevant receptors,
such pharmacokinetic differences may alter the clinical response. Some differences can be predicted on the bas of age, weight, sex, disease state, liver and kidney function, and by testing specifically for genetic differences tl may result from inheritance of a functionally distinctive complement of drug-metabolizing enzymes (see Chapte 3 and 4). Another important mechanism influencing drug availability is active transport of drug from the cytoplasm, mediated by a family of membrane transporters encoded by the so-called multidrug resistance (MDI genes. For example, up-regulation of MDR gene-encoded transporter expression is a major mechanism by whic tumor cells develop resistance to anticancer drugs.

\section*{VARIATION IN CONCENTRATION OF AN ENDOGENOUS RECEPTOR LIGAND}

This mechanism contributes greatly to variability in responses to pharmacologic antagonists. Thus, propranolol, B-adrenoceptor antagonist, will markedly slow the heart rate of a patient whose endogenous catecholamines ar elevated (as in pheochromocytoma) but will not affect the resting heart rate of a well-trained marathon runner. partial agonist may exhibit even more dramatically different responses: Saralasin, a weak partial agonist at angiotensin II receptors, lowers blood pressure in patients with hypertension caused by increased angiotensin I production and raises blood pressure in patients who produce small amounts of angiotensin.

\section*{ALTERATIONS IN NUMBER OR FUNCTION OF RECEPTORS}

Experimental studies have documented changes in drug responsiveness caused by increases or decreases in th number of receptor sites or by alterations in the efficiency of coupling of receptors to distal effector mechanism In some cases, the change in receptor number is caused by other hormones; for example, thyroid hormones increase both the number of Breceptors in rat heart muscle and cardiac sensitivity to catecholamines. Similar changes probably contribute to the tachycardia of thyrotoxicosis in patients and may account for the usefulness propranolol, a B-adrenoceptor antagonist, in ameliorating symptoms of this disease.

In other cases, the agonist ligand itself induces a decrease in the number (eg, down-regulation) or coupling efficiency (eg, desensitization) of its receptors. These mechanisms (discussed above, under Signaling Mechanis \& Drug Actions) may contribute to two clinically important phenomena: first, tachyphylaxis or tolerance to the effects of some drugs (eg, biogenic amines and their congeners), and second, the "overshoot" phenomena that follow withdrawal of certain drugs. These phenomena can occur with either agonists or antagonists. An antagor may increase the number of receptors in a critical cell or tissue by preventing down-regulation caused by an endogenous agonist. When the antagonist is withdrawn, the elevated number of receptors can produce an exaggerated response to physiologic concentrations of agonist. Potentially disastrous withdrawal symptoms can result for the opposite reason when administration of an agonist drug is discontinued. In this situation, the number of receptors, which has been decreased by drug-induced down-regulation, is too low for endogenous agonist to produce effective stimulation. For example, the withdrawal of clonidine (a drug whose $a_{2}$-adrenocep agonist activity reduces blood pressure) can produce hypertensive crisis, probably because the drug downregulates $\alpha_{2}$-adrenoceptors (see Chapter 11).

Genetic factors also can play an important role in altering the number or function of specific receptors. For example, a specific genetic variant of the 2 c -adrenoceptor-when inherited together with a specific variant of the $a_{1}$-adrenoceptor-confers increased risk for developing heart failure, which may be reduced by early intervention using antagonist drugs. The identification of such genetic factors, part of the rapidly developing fiel of pharmacogenetics, holds promise for clinical diagnosis and in the future may help physicians design the mosi appropriate pharmacologic therapy for individual patients. Another interesting example of genetic effects on dri response is seen in the treatment of cancers involving excessive growth factor signaling. Somatic mutations affecting the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor confer enhanced sensitivity to kinc
inhibitors such as gefitinib in certain lung cancers. This effect enhances the antineoplastic effect of the drug anc because the somatic mutation is specific to the tumor and not present in the host, the therapeutic index of thes drugs can be significantly enhanced in patients whose tumors harbor such somatic mutations.

\section*{CHANGES IN COMPONENTS OF RESPONSE DISTAL TO THE RECEPTOR}

Although a drug initiates its actions by binding to receptors, the response observed in a patient depends on the functional integrity of biochemical processes in the responding cell and physiologic regulation by interacting org systems. Clinically, changes in these postreceptor processes represent the largest and most important class of mechanisms that cause variation in responsiveness to drug therapy.

Before initiating therapy with a drug, the prescriber should be aware of patient characteristics that may limit th clinical response. These characteristics include the age and general health of the patient and-most importantly-the severity and pathophysiologic mechanism of the disease. The most important potential cause failure to achieve a satisfactory response is that the diagnosis is wrong or physiologically incomplete. Drug therapy will always be most successful when it is accurately directed at the pathophysiologic mechanism responsible for the disease.

When the diagnosis is correct and the drug is appropriate, an unsatisfactory therapeutic response can often be traced to compensatory mechanisms in the patient that respond to and oppose the beneficial effects of the druc Compensatory increases in sympathetic nervous tone and fluid retention by the kidney, for example, can contribute to tolerance to antihypertensive effects of a vasodilator drug. In such cases, additional drugs may be required to achieve a useful therapeutic result.

\section*{Clinical Selectivity: Beneficial versus Toxic Effects of Drugs}

Although we classify drugs according to their principal actions, it is clear that no drug causes only a single, spec effect. Why is this so? It is exceedingly unlikely that any kind of drug molecule will bind to only a single type of receptor molecule, if only because the number of potential receptors in every patient is astronomically large. Ev if the chemical structure of a drug allowed it to bind to only one kind of receptor, the biochemical processes controlled by such receptors would take place in multiple cell types and would be coupled to many other biochemical functions; as a result, the patient and the prescriber would probably perceive more than one drug effect. Accordingly, drugs are only selective -rather than specific-in their actions, because they bind to one or few types of receptor more tightly than to others and because these receptors control discrete processes that result in distinct effects.

It is only because of their selectivity that drugs are useful in clinical medicine. Selectivity can be measured by comparing binding affinities of a drug to different receptors or by comparing $\mathrm{ED}_{50} \mathrm{~s}$ for different effects of a dru in vivo. In drug development and in clinical medicine, selectivity is usually considered by separating effects into two categories: beneficial or therapeutic effects versus toxic effects. Pharmaceutical advertisements and prescribers occasionally use the term side effect, implying that the effect in question is insignificant or occurs a pathway that is to one side of the principal action of the drug; such implications are frequently erroneous.

\section*{BENEFICIAL AND TOXIC EFFECTS MEDIATED BY THE SAME RECEPTOR-EFFECTOR MECHANISM}

Much of the serious drug toxicity in clinical practice represents a direct pharmacologic extension of the therapel actions of the drug. In some of these cases (eg, bleeding caused by anticoagulant therapy; hypoglycemic coma due to insulin), toxicity may be avoided by judicious management of the dose of drug administered, guided by careful monitoring of effect (measurements of blood coagulation or serum glucose) and aided by ancillary measures (avoiding tissue trauma that may lead to hemorrhage; regulation of carbohydrate intake). In still oth
cases, the toxicity may be avoided by not administering the drug at all, if the therapeutic indication is weak or i other therapy is available.

In certain situations, a drug is clearly necessary and beneficial but produces unacceptable toxicity when given it doses that produce optimal benefit. In such situations, it may be necessary to add another drug to the treatme regimen. In treating hypertension, for example, administration of a second drug often allows the prescriber to reduce the dose and toxicity of the first drug (see Chapter 11).

\section*{BENEFICIAL AND TOXIC EFFECTS MEDIATED BY IDENTICAL RECEPTORS BUT IN DIFFERENT TISSUE OR BY DIFFERENT EFFECTOR PATHWAYS}

Many drugs produce both their desired effects and adverse effects by acting on a single receptor type in differe tissues. Examples discussed in this book include: digitalis glycosides, which act by inhibiting $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase in cell membranes; methotrexate, which inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase; and glucocorticoid hormone

Three therapeutic strategies are used to avoid or mitigate this sort of toxicity. First, the drug should always be administered at the lowest dose that produces acceptable benefit. Second, adjunctive drugs that act through different receptor mechanisms and produce different toxicities may allow lowering the dose of the first drug, thi limiting its toxicity (eg, use of other immunosuppressive agents added to glucocorticoids in treating inflammato disorders). Third, selectivity of the drug's actions may be increased by manipulating the concentrations of drug available to receptors in different parts of the body, for example, by aerosol administration of a glucocorticoid t the bronchi in asthma.

\section*{BENEFICIAL AND TOXIC EFFECTS MEDIATED BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF RECEPTORS}

Therapeutic advantages resulting from new chemical entities with improved receptor selectivity were mentioner earlier in this chapter and are described in detail in later chapters. Such drugs include the and B-selective adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists, the $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antihistamines, nicotinic and muscarinic blocking agents and receptor-selective steroid hormones. All of these receptors are grouped in functional families, each respons to a small class of endogenous agonists. The receptors and their associated therapeutic uses were discovered l analyzing effects of the physiologic chemical signals-catecholamines, histamine, acetylcholine, and corticosteroids.

Several other drugs were discovered by exploiting therapeutic or toxic effects of chemically similar agents observed in a clinical context. Examples include quinidine, the sulfonylureas, thiazide diuretics, tricyclic antidepressants, opioid drugs, and phenothiazine antipsychotics. Often the new agents turn out to interact with receptors for endogenous substances (eg, opioids and phenothiazines for endogenous opioid and dopamine receptors, respectively). It is likely that other new drugs will be found to do so in the future, perhaps leading to the discovery of new classes of receptors and endogenous ligands for future drug development.

Thus, the propensity of drugs to bind to different classes of receptor sites is not only a potentially vexing proble in treating patients, it also presents a continuing challenge to pharmacology and an opportunity for developing new and more useful drugs.

\section*{PHARMACOKI NETI CS \& PHARMACODYNAMI CS: RATIONAL DOSI NG \& THE TI ME COURSE OF DRUG ACTION: I NTRODUCTION}

The goal of therapeutics is to achieve a desired beneficial effect with minimal adverse effects. When a medicine has been selected for a patient, the clinician must determine the dose that most closely achieves this goal. A rational approach to this objective combines the principles of pharmacokinetics with pharmacodynamics to clarify the dose-effect relationship (Figure 3-1). Pharmacodynamics governs the concentration-effect part of the interaction, whereas pharmacokinetics deals with the dose-concentration part. The pharmacokinetic processes of absorption, distribution, and elimination determine how rapidly and for how long the drug will appear at the target organ. The pharmacodynamic concepts of maximum response and sensitivity determine the magnitude of the effect at a particular concentration (see the definitions of $\mathrm{E}_{\text {max }}$ and $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$, Chapter 2).

\section*{Figure 3-1.}

The relationship between dose and effect can be separated into pharmacokinetic (dose-concentration) and pharmacodynamic (concentration-effect) components. Concentration provides the link between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and is the focus of the target concentration approach to rational dosing. The three primary processes of pharmacokinetics are absorption, distribution, and elimination.

Figure 3-1 illustrates a fundamental hypothesis of pharmacology, namely, that a relationship exists between a beneficial or toxic effect of a drug and the concentration of the drug. This hypothesis has been documented for many drugs, as indicated by the Target Concentrations and Toxic Concentrations columns in Table 3-1. The apparent lack of such a relationship for some drugs does not weaken the basic hypothesis but points to the need to consider the time course of concentration at the actual site of pharmacologic effect (see below).

Knowing the relationship between dose, drug concentration, and effects allows the clinician to take into account the various pathologic and physiologic features of a particular patient that make him or her different from the average individual in responding to a drug. The importance of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in patient care thus rests upon the improvement in therapeutic benefit and reduction in toxicity that can be achieved by application of these principles.

\section*{PHARMACOKI NETI CS}

The "standard" dose of a drug is based on trials in healthy volunteers and patients with average ability to absorb, distribute, and eliminate the drug (see Clinical Trials: The IND \& NDA in Chapter 5 ). This dose will not be suitable for every patient. Several physiologic processes (eg, maturation of organ function in infants) and pathologic processes (eg, heart failure, renal failure) dictate dosage adjustment in individual patients. These processes modify specific pharmacokinetic parameters. The two basic parameters are clearance, the measure of the ability of the body to eliminate the drug; and volume of distribution, the measure of the apparent space in the body available to contain the drug. These parameters are illustrated schematically in Figure 3-2, where the volume of the compartments into which the drugs diffuse represents the volume of distribution and the size of the outflow "drain" in Figures 3-2B and 3-2D represents the clearance.
Figure 3-2.

Models of drug distribution and elimination. The effect of adding drug to the blood by rapid intravenous injection is represented by expelling a known amount of the agent into a beaker. The time course of the amount of drug in the beaker is shown in the graphs at the right. In the first example ( $\mathbf{A}$ ), there is no movement of drug out of the beaker, so the graph shows only a steep rise to maximum followed by a plateau. In the second example (B), a route of elimination is present, and the graph shows a slow decay after a sharp rise to a maximum. Because the level of material in the beaker falls, the "pressure" driving the elimination process also falls, and the slope of the curve decreases. This is an exponential decay curve. In the third model (C), drug placed in the first compartment ("blood") equilibrates rapidly with the second compartment ("extravascular volume") and the amount of drug in "blood" declines exponentially to a new steady state. The fourth model (D) illustrates a more realistic combination of elimination mechanism and extravascular
equilibration. The resulting graph shows an early distribution phase followed by the slower elimination phase.

Volume of distribution ( $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{d}}$ ) relates the amount of drug in the body to the concentration of drug ( C ) in blood or plasma:

The volume of distribution may be defined with respect to blood, plasma, or water (unbound drug), depending on the concentration used in equation (1) ( $C=C_{b}, C_{p}$, or $C_{u}$ ).

That the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{d}}$ calculated from equation (1) is an apparent volume may be appreciated by comparing the volumes of distribution of drugs such as digoxin or chloroquine (Table 3-1) with some of the physical volumes of the body (Table 3-2). Volume of distribution can vastly exceed any physical volume in the body because it is the volume apparently necessary to contain the amount of drug homogeneously at the concentration found in the blood, plasma, or water. Drugs with very high volumes of distribution have much higher concentrations in extravascular tissue than in the vascular compartment; that is, they are not homogeneously distributed. Drugs that are completely retained within the vascular compartment, on the other hand, have a minimum possible volume of distribution equal to the blood component in which they are distributed, eg, $0.04 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight or $2.8 \mathrm{~L} / 70 \mathrm{~kg}$ (Table 3-2) for a drug that is restricted to the plasma compartment.

${ }^{1}$ An average figure. Total body water in a young lean man might be $0.7 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{kg}$; in an obese woman, 0.5 $\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{kg}$.

\section*{Clearance}

Drug clearance principles are similar to the clearance concepts of renal physiology. Clearance of a drug is the factor that predicts the rate of elimination in relation to the drug concentration:

Clearance, like volume of distribution, may be defined with respect to blood ( $C L_{b}$ ), plasma ( $C L_{p}$ ), or unbound in water ( $C L_{u}$ ), depending on the concentration measured.

It is important to note the additive character of clearance. Elimination of drug from the body may involve processes occurring in the kidney, the lung, the liver, and other organs. Dividing the rate of elimination at each organ by the concentration of drug presented to it yields the respective clearance at that organ. Added together, these separate clearances equal total systemic clearance:
"Other" tissues of elimination could include the lungs and additional sites of metabolism, eg, blood or muscle.

The two major sites of drug elimination are the kidneys and the liver. Clearance of unchanged drug in the urine represents renal clearance. Within the liver, drug elimination occurs via biotransformation of parent drug to one or more metabolites, or excretion of unchanged drug into the bile, or both. The pathways of biotransformation are discussed in Chapter 4. For most drugs, clearance is constant over the concentration range encountered in clinical settings, ie, elimination is not saturable, and the rate of drug elimination is directly proportional to concentration (rearranging equation [2]):

This is usually referred to as first-order elimination. When clearance is first-order, it can be estimated by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the time-concentration profile after a dose. Clearance is calculated from the dose divided by the AUC.

\section*{CAPACITY-LI MITED ELI MINATI ON}

For drugs that exhibit capacity-limited elimination (eg, phenytoin, ethanol), clearance will vary depending
on the concentration of drug that is achieved (Table 3-1). Capacity-limited elimination is also known as saturable, dose- or concentration-dependent, nonlinear, and Michaelis-Menten elimination.

Most drug elimination pathways will become saturated if the dose is high enough. When blood flow to an organ does not limit elimination (see below), the relation between elimination rate and concentration (C) is expressed mathematically in equation (5):

The maximum elimination capacity is $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$, and $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{m}}$ is the drug concentration at which the rate of elimination is $50 \%$ of $\mathrm{V}_{\text {max }}$. At concentrations that are high relative to the $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{m}}$, the elimination rate is almost independent of concentration-a state of "pseudo-zero order" elimination. If dosing rate exceeds elimination capacity, steady state cannot be achieved: The concentration will keep on rising as long as dosing continues. This pattern of capacity-limited elimination is important for three drugs in common use: ethanol, phenytoin, and aspirin. Clearance has no real meaning for drugs with capacity-limited elimination, and AUC cannot be used to describe the elimination of such drugs.

\section*{FLOW-DEPENDENT ELI MI NATION}

In contrast to capacity-limited drug elimination, some drugs are cleared very readily by the organ of elimination, so that at any clinically realistic concentration of the drug, most of the drug in the blood perfusing the organ is eliminated on the first pass of the drug through it. The elimination of these drugs will thus depend primarily on the rate of drug delivery to the organ of elimination. Such drugs (see Table 4-7) can be called "high-extraction" drugs since they are almost completely extracted from the blood by the organ. Blood flow to the organ is the main determinant of drug delivery, but plasma protein binding and blood cell partitioning may also be important for extensively bound drugs that are highly extracted.

\section*{Half-Life}

Half-life ( $\mathrm{t}_{1 / 2}$ ) is the time required to change the amount of drug in the body by one-half during elimination (or during a constant infusion). In the simplest case-and the most useful in designing drug dosage regimens—the body may be considered as a single compartment (as illustrated in Figure 3-2B) of a size equal to the volume of distribution ( $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{d}}$ ). The time course of drug in the body will depend on both the volume of distribution and the clearance:
$\square$

Half-life is useful because it indicates the time required to attain 50\% of steady state-or to decay 50\% from steady-state conditions-after a change in the rate of drug administration. Figure 3-3 shows the time course of drug accumulation during a constant-rate drug infusion and the time course of drug elimination after stopping an infusion that has reached steady state.
Figure 3-3.

The time course of drug accumulation and elimination. Solid line: Plasma concentrations reflecting drug accumulation during a constant rate infusion of a drug. Fifty percent of the steady-state concentration is reached after one half-life, $75 \%$ after two half-lives, and over $90 \%$ after four half-lives. Dashed line: Plasma concentrations reflecting drug elimination after a constant rate infusion of a drug had reached steady state. Fifty percent of the drug is lost after one half-life, $75 \%$ after two half-lives, etc. The "rule of thumb" that four half-lives must elapse after starting a drug-dosing regimen before full effects will be seen is based on the approach of the accumulation curve to over $90 \%$ of the final steady-state concentration.

Disease states can affect both of the physiologically related primary pharmacokinetic parameters: volume of distribution and clearance. A change in half-life will not necessarily reflect a change in drug elimination. For example, patients with chronic renal failure have decreased renal clearance of digoxin but also a decreased volume of distribution; the increase in digoxin half-life is not as great as might be expected based on the change in renal function. The decrease in volume of distribution is due to the decreased renal and skeletal muscle mass and consequent decreased tissue binding of digoxin to $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase.

Many drugs will exhibit multicompartment pharmacokinetics (as illustrated in Figures 3-2C and 3-2D). Under these conditions, the "true" terminal half-life, as given in Table 3-1, will be greater than that calculated from equation (6).
*The constant 0.7 in equation (6) is an approximation to the natural logarithm of 2 . Because drug elimination can be described by an exponential process, the time taken for a twofold decrease can be shown to be proportional to $\ln (2)$.

\section*{Drug Accumulation}

Whenever drug doses are repeated, the drug will accumulate in the body until dosing stops. This is because it takes an infinite time (in theory) to eliminate all of a given dose. In practical terms, this means that if the dosing interval is shorter than four half-lives, accumulation will be detectable.

Accumulation is inversely proportional to the fraction of the dose lost in each dosing interval. The fraction lost is 1 minus the fraction remaining just before the next dose. The fraction remaining can be predicted from the dosing interval and the half-life. A convenient index of accumulation is the accumulation factor.

For a drug given once every half-life, the accumulation factor is $1 / 0.5$, or 2 . The accumulation factor predicts the ratio of the steady-state concentration to that seen at the same time following the first dose. Thus, the peak concentrations after intermittent doses at steady state will be equal to the peak concentration after the first dose multiplied by the accumulation factor.

\section*{Bioavailability}

Bioavailability is defined as the fraction of unchanged drug reaching the systemic circulation following administration by any route (Table 3-3). The area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC) is a common measure of the extent of bioavailability for a drug given by a particular route (Figure 3-4). For an intravenous dose of the drug, bioavailability is assumed to be equal to unity. For a drug administered orally, bioavailability may be less than $100 \%$ for two main reasons-incomplete extent of absorption and first-pass elimination.
Table 3-3. Routes of Administration, Bioavailability, and General Characteristics.

\section*{Route \\ Bioavailability (\%) Characteristics}

100 (by definition)
Most rapid onset
Intramuscular (IM)
75 to $\square 100$
Large volumes often feasible; may be painful

Blood concentration-time curves, illustrating how changes in the rate of absorption and extent of bioavailability can influence both the duration of action and the effectiveness of the same total dose of a drug administered in three different formulations. The dashed line indicates the target concentration (TC) of the drug in the blood.

\section*{EXTENT OF ABSORPTION}

After oral administration, a drug may be incompletely absorbed, eg, only $70 \%$ of a dose of digoxin reaches the systemic circulation. This is mainly due to lack of absorption from the gut. Other drugs are either too hydrophilic (eg, atenolol) or too lipophilic (eg, acyclovir) to be absorbed easily, and their low bioavailability is also due to incomplete absorption. If too hydrophilic, the drug cannot cross the lipid cell membrane; if too lipophilic, the drug is not soluble enough to cross the water layer adjacent to the cell. Drugs may not be absorbed because of a reverse transporter associated with P-glycoprotein. This process actively pumps drug out of gut wall cells back into the gut lumen. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein and gut wall metabolism, eg, by grapefruit juice, may be associated with substantially increased drug absorption.

\section*{FIRST-PASS ELI MI NATION}

Following absorption across the gut wall, the portal blood delivers the drug to the liver prior to entry into the systemic circulation. A drug can be metabolized in the gut wall (eg, by the CYP3A4 enzyme system) or even in the portal blood, but most commonly it is the liver that is responsible for metabolism before the drug reaches the systemic circulation. In addition, the liver can excrete the drug into the bile. Any of these sites can contribute to this reduction in bioavailability, and the overall process is known as first-pass elimination. The effect of first-pass hepatic elimination on bioavailability is expressed as the extraction ratio (ER):
where Q is hepatic blood flow, normally about $90 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{h}$ in a person weighing 70 kg .
The systemic bioavailability of the drug (F) can be predicted from the extent of absorption (f) and the extraction ratio (ER):

A drug such as morphine is almost completely absorbed ( $f=1$ ), so that loss in the gut is negligible. However, the hepatic extraction ratio for morphine is 0.67 , so ( $1-\mathrm{ER}$ ) is 0.33 . The bioavailability of morphine is therefore expected to be about $33 \%$, which is close to the observed value (Table 3-1).

\section*{RATE OF ABSORPTION}

The distinction between rate and extent of absorption is shown in Figure 3-4. The rate of absorption is determined by the site of administration and the drug formulation. Both the rate of absorption and the extent of input can influence the clinical effectiveness of a drug. For the three different dosage forms depicted in Figure 3-4, there would be significant differences in the intensity of clinical effect. Dosage form B would require twice the dose to attain blood concentrations equivalent to those of dosage form A. Differences in rate of availability may become important for drugs given as a single dose, such as a hypnotic used to induce sleep. In this case, drug from dosage form A would reach its target concentration earlier than drug from dosage form C ; concentrations from A would also reach a higher level and remain above the target concentration for a longer period. In a multiple dosing regimen, dosage forms A and C would yield the same average blood level concentrations, although dosage form A would show somewhat greater maximum and lower minimum concentrations.

The mechanism of drug absorption is said to be zero-order when the rate is independent of the amount of drug remaining in the gut, eg, when it is determined by the rate of gastric emptying or by a controlledrelease drug formulation. In contrast, when the full dose is dissolved in gastrointestinal fluids, the rate of absorption is usually proportional to the gastrointestinal concentration and is said to be first-order.

\section*{Extraction Ratio \& the First-Pass Effect}

Systemic clearance is not affected by bioavailability. However, clearance can markedly affect the extent of availability because it determines the extraction ratio (equation [8a]). Of course, therapeutic blood concentrations may still be reached by the oral route of administration if larger doses are given. However, in this case, the concentrations of the drug metabolites will be increased significantly over those that would occur following intravenous administration. Lidocaine and verapamil are both used to treat cardiac
arrhythmias and have bioavailability less than $40 \%$, but lidocaine is never given orally because its metabolites are believed to contribute to central nervous system toxicity. Other drugs that are highly extracted by the liver include morphine, propranolol, verapamil, and several tricyclic antidepressants (Table $3-1$ ) as well as isoniazid.

Drugs with high extraction ratios will show marked variations in bioavailability between subjects because of differences in hepatic function and blood flow. These differences can explain the marked variation in drug concentrations that occurs among individuals given similar doses of highly extracted drugs. For drugs that are highly extracted by the liver, shunting of blood past hepatic sites of elimination will result in substantial increases in drug availability, whereas for drugs that are poorly extracted by the liver (for which the difference between entering and exiting drug concentration is small), shunting of blood past the liver will cause little change in availability. Drugs in Table 3-1 that are poorly extracted by the liver include chlorpropamide, diazepam, phenytoin, theophylline, tolbutamide, and warfarin.

\section*{Alternative Routes of Administration \& the First-Pass Effect}

There are several reasons for different routes of administration used in clinical medicine (Table 3-3)-for convenience (eg, oral), to maximize concentration at the site of action and minimize it elsewhere (eg, topical), to prolong the duration of drug absorption (eg, transdermal), or to avoid the first-pass effect.

The hepatic first-pass effect can be avoided to a great extent by use of sublingual tablets and transdermal preparations and to a lesser extent by use of rectal suppositories. Sublingual absorption provides direct access to systemic—not portal—veins. The transdermal route offers the same advantage. Drugs absorbed from suppositories in the lower rectum enter vessels that drain into the inferior vena cava, thus bypassing the liver. However, suppositories tend to move upward in the rectum into a region where veins that lead to the liver predominate. Thus, only about $50 \%$ of a rectal dose can be assumed to bypass the liver.

Although drugs administered by inhalation bypass the hepatic first-pass effect, the lung may also serve as a site of first-pass loss by excretion and possibly metabolism for drugs administered by nongastrointestinal ("parenteral") routes.

\section*{THE TI ME COURSE OF DRUG EFFECT}

The principles of pharmacokinetics (discussed in this chapter) and those of pharmacodynamics (discussed in Chapter 2; Holford \& Sheiner, 1981) provide a framework for understanding the time course of drug effect.

\section*{I mmediate Effects}

In the simplest case, drug effects are directly related to plasma concentrations, but this does not necessarily mean that effects simply parallel the time course of concentrations. Because the relationship between drug concentration and effect is not linear (recall the $\mathrm{E}_{\text {max }}$ model described in Chapter 2), the effect will not usually be linearly proportional to the concentration.

Consider the effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, such as enalapril, on plasma ACE. The half-life of enalapril is about 3 hours. After an oral dose of 10 mg , the plasma concentration at 3 hours is about $50 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$. Enalapril is usually given once a day, so seven half-lives will elapse from the time of peak concentration to the end of the dosing interval. The concentration of enalapril after each half-life and the corresponding extent of ACE inhibition are shown in Figure 3-5. The extent of inhibition of ACE is
calculated using the $\mathrm{E}_{\text {max }}$ model, where $\mathrm{E}_{\text {max }}$, the maximum extent of inhibition, is $100 \%$ and the $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ is about $1 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$.

\section*{Figure 3-5.}

Time course of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor concentrations and effects. The black line shows the plasma enalapril concentrations in nanograms per milliliter after a single oral dose. The colored line indicates the percentage inhibition of its target, ACE. Note the different shapes of the concentration-time course (exponentially decreasing) and the effect-time course (linearly decreasing in its central portion).

Note that plasma concentrations of enalapril change by a factor of 16 over the first 12 hours (four halflives) after the peak, but ACE inhibition has only decreased by $20 \%$. Because the concentrations over this time are so high in relation to the $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$, the effect on ACE is almost constant. After 24 hours, ACE is still $33 \%$ inhibited. This explains why a drug with a short half-life can be given once a day and still maintain its effect throughout the day. The key factor is a high initial concentration in relation to the $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$. Even though the plasma concentration at 24 hours is less than $1 \%$ of its peak, this low concentration is still half the $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ . This is very common for drugs that act on enzymes (eg, ACE inhibitors) or compete at receptors (eg, propranolol).

When concentrations are in the range between one fourth and four times the $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$, the time course of effect is essentially a linear function of time-13\% of the effect is lost every half-life over this concentration range. At concentrations below one fourth the $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$, the effect becomes almost directly proportional to concentration and the time course of drug effect will follow the exponential decline of concentration. It is only when the concentration is low in relation to the $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ that the concept of a "half-life of drug effect" has any meaning.

\section*{Delayed Effects}

Changes in drug effects are often delayed in relation to changes in plasma concentration. This delay may reflect the time required for the drug to distribute from plasma to the site of action. This will be the case for almost all drugs. The delay due to distribution is a pharmacokinetic phenomenon that can account for delays of a few minutes. This distributional delay can account for the lag of effects after rapid intravenous injection of central nervous system (CNS)-active agents such as thiopental.

A common reason for more delayed drug effects-especially those that take many hours or even days to
occur-is the slow turnover of a physiologic substance that is involved in the expression of the drug effect. For example, warfarin works as an anticoagulant by inhibiting vitamin K epoxidase in the liver. This action of warfarin occurs rapidly, and inhibition of the enzyme is closely related to plasma concentrations of warfarin. The clinical effect of warfarin, eg, on the prothrombin time, reflects a decrease in the concentration of the prothrombin complex of clotting factors. Inhibition of vitamin K epoxidase decreases the synthesis of these clotting factors, but the complex has a long half-life (about 14 hours), and it is this half-life that determines how long it takes for the concentration of clotting factors to reach a new steady state and for a drug effect to become manifest that reflects the warfarin plasma concentration.

\section*{Cumulative Effects}

Some drug effects are more obviously related to a cumulative action than to a rapidly reversible one. The renal toxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics (eg, gentamicin) is greater when administered as a constant infusion than with intermittent dosing. It is the accumulation of aminoglycoside in the renal cortex that is thought to cause renal damage. Even though both dosing schemes produce the same average steady-state concentration, the intermittent dosing scheme produces much higher peak concentrations, which saturate an uptake mechanism into the cortex; thus, total aminoglycoside accumulation is less. The difference in toxicity is a predictable consequence of the different patterns of concentration and the saturable uptake mechanism.

The effect of many drugs used to treat cancer also reflects a cumulative action-eg, the extent of binding of a drug to DNA is proportional to drug concentration and is usually irreversible. The effect on tumor growth is therefore a consequence of cumulative exposure to the drug. Measures of cumulative exposure, such as AUC, provide a means to individualize treatment.

\section*{THE TARGET CONCENTRATION APPROACH TO DESI GNI NG A RATIONAL DOSAGE REGI MEN}

A rational dosage regimen is based on the assumption that there is a target concentration that will produce the desired therapeutic effect. By considering the pharmacokinetic factors that determine the dose-concentration relationship, it is possible to individualize the dose regimen to achieve the target concentration. The effective concentration ranges shown in Table 3-1 are a guide to the concentrations measured when patients are being effectively treated. The initial target concentration should usually be chosen from the lower end of this range. In some cases, the target concentration will also depend on the specific therapeutic objective-eg, the control of atrial fibrillation by digoxin often requires a target concentration of $2 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$, while heart failure is usually adequately managed with a target concentration of $1 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$.

\section*{Maintenance Dose}

In most clinical situations, drugs are administered in such a way as to maintain a steady state of drug in the body, ie, just enough drug is given in each dose to replace the drug eliminated since the preceding dose. Thus, calculation of the appropriate maintenance dose is a primary goal. Clearance is the most important pharmacokinetic term to be considered in defining a rational steady-state drug dosage regimen. At steady state, the dosing rate ("rate in") must equal the rate of elimination ("rate out"). Substitution of the target concentration (TC) for concentration (C) in equation (4) predicts the maintenance dosing rate:

Thus, if the desired target concentration is known, the clearance in that patient will determine the dosing rate. If the drug is given by a route that has a bioavailability less than $100 \%$, then the dosing rate predicted by equation (9) must be modified. For oral dosing:
$\square$

If intermittent doses are given, the maintenance dose is calculated from:
$\square$
(See Example: Maintenance Dose Calculation.)
Note that the steady-state concentration achieved by continuous infusion or the average concentration following intermittent dosing depends only on clearance. The volume of distribution and the half-life need not be known in order to determine the average plasma concentration expected from a given dosing rate or to predict the dosing rate for a desired target concentration. Figure 3-6 shows that at different dosing intervals, the concentration time curves will have different maximum and minimum values even though the average level will always be $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$.
Figure 3-6.

Relationship between frequency of dosing and maximum and minimum plasma concentrations when a steady-state theophylline plasma level of $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ is desired. The smoothly rising line (solid black) shows the plasma concentration achieved with an intravenous infusion of $28 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{h}$. The doses for 8-hourly administration (light color) are 224 mg ; for 24-hourly administration (dark color), 672 mg . In each of the three cases, the mean steady-state plasma concentration
is $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$.

Estimates of dosing rate and average steady-state concentrations, which may be calculated using clearance, are independent of any specific pharmacokinetic model. In contrast, the determination of maximum and minimum steady-state concentrations requires further assumptions about the pharmacokinetic model. The accumulation factor (equation [7]) assumes that the drug follows a onecompartment body model (Figure 3-2B), and the peak concentration prediction assumes that the absorption rate is much faster than the elimination rate. For the calculation of estimated maximum and minimum concentrations in a clinical situation, these assumptions are usually reasonable.

\section*{EXAMPLE: MAI NTENANCE DOSE CALCULATION}

A target plasma theophylline concentration of $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ is desired to relieve acute bronchial asthma in a patient. If the patient is a nonsmoker and otherwise normal except for asthma, we may use the mean clearance given in Table 3-1, ie, $2.8 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{h} / 70 \mathrm{~kg}$. Since the drug will be given as an intravenous infusion, $\mathrm{F}=$ 1.

Therefore, in this patient, the proper infusion rate would be $28 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{h} / 70 \mathrm{~kg}$.
If the asthma attack is relieved, the clinician might want to maintain this plasma level using oral theophylline, which might be given every 12 hours using an extended-release formulation to approximate a continuous intravenous infusion. According to Table 3-1, Foral is 0.96 . When the dosing interval is 12 hours, the size of each maintenance dose would be:
$\square$

A tablet or capsule size close to the ideal dose of 350 mg would then be prescribed at 12 -hourly intervals. If an 8 -hour dosing interval was used, the ideal dose would be 233 mg ; and if the drug was given once a day, the dose would be 700 mg . In practice, F could be omitted from the calculation since it is so close to 1 .

\section*{Loading Dose}

When the time to reach steady state is appreciable, as it is for drugs with long half-lives, it may be desirable to administer a loading dose that promptly raises the concentration of drug in plasma to the target concentration. In theory, only the amount of the loading dose need be computed-not the rate of its administration-and, to a first approximation, this is so. The volume of distribution is the proportionality factor that relates the total amount of drug in the body to the concentration in the plasma ( $\mathrm{C}_{p}$ ); if a loading dose is to achieve the target concentration, then from equation (1):

For the theophylline example given in Example: Maintenance Dose Calculation, the loading dose would be 350 mg ( $35 \mathrm{~L} \times 10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ ) for a 70 kg person. For most drugs, the loading dose can be given as a single dose by the chosen route of administration.

Up to this point, we have ignored the fact that some drugs follow more complex multicompartment pharmacokinetics, eg, the distribution process illustrated by the two-compartment model in Figure 3-2. This is justified in the great majority of cases. However, in some cases the distribution phase may not be ignored, particularly in connection with the calculation of loading doses. If the rate of absorption is rapid relative to distribution (this is always true for intravenous bolus administration), the concentration of drug in plasma that results from an appropriate loading dose-calculated using the apparent volume of distribution-can initially be considerably higher than desired. Severe toxicity may occur, albeit transiently. This may be particularly important, for example, in the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs such as lidocaine, where an almost immediate toxic response may occur. Thus, while the estimation of the amount of a loading dose may be quite correct, the rate of administration can sometimes be crucial in preventing excessive drug concentrations, and slow administration of an intravenous drug (over minutes rather than seconds) is almost always prudent practice. For intravenous doses of theophylline, initial injections should be given over a 20-minute period to reduce the possibility of high plasma concentrations during the distribution phase.

When intermittent doses are given, the loading dose calculated from equation (12) will only reach the average steady-state concentration and will not match the peak steady-state concentration (Figure 3-6). To match the peak steady-state concentration, the loading dose can be calculated from equation (13):

\section*{THERAPEUTIC DRUG MONITORI NG: RELATI NG PHARMACOKI NETI CS \& PHARMACODYNAMI CS}

The basic principles outlined above can be applied to the interpretation of clinical drug concentration measurements on the basis of three major pharmacokinetic variables: absorption, clearance, and volume of distribution (and the derived variable, half-life); and two pharmacodynamic variables: maximum effect attainable in the target tissue and the sensitivity of the tissue to the drug. Diseases may modify all of these parameters, and the ability to predict the effect of disease states on pharmacokinetic parameters is important in properly adjusting dosage in such cases. (See The Target Concentration Strategy.)

\section*{The Target Concentration Strategy}

Recognition of the essential role of concentration in linking pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics leads naturally to the target concentration strategy. Pharmacodynamic principles can be used to predict the concentration required to achieve a particular degree of therapeutic effect. This target concentration can then be achieved by using pharmacokinetic principles to arrive at a suitable dosing regimen. The target
concentration strategy is a process for optimizing the dose in an individual on the basis of a measured surrogate response such as drug concentration:
1. Choose the target concentration, TC.
2. Predict volume of distribution ( $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{d}}$ ) and clearance ( CL ) based on standard population values ( eg , Table 3-1) with adjustments for factors such as weight and renal function.
3. Give a loading dose or maintenance dose calculated from $\mathrm{TC}, \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{d}}$, and CL .
4. Measure the patient's response and drug concentration.
5. Revise $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{d}}$ and/or CL based on the measured concentration.
6. Repeat steps 3-5, adjusting the predicted dose to achieve TC.

\section*{Pharmacokinetic Variables}

\section*{ABSORPTION}

The amount of drug that enters the body depends on the patient's compliance with the prescribed regimen and on the rate and extent of transfer from the site of administration to the blood.

Overdosage and underdosage relative to the prescribed dosage-both aspects of failure of compliance-can frequently be detected by concentration measurements when gross deviations from expected values are obtained. If compliance is found to be adequate, absorption abnormalities in the small bowel may be the cause of abnormally low concentrations. Variations in the extent of bioavailability are rarely caused by irregularities in the manufacture of the particular drug formulation. More commonly, variations in bioavailability are due to metabolism during absorption.

\section*{CLEARANCE}

Abnormal clearance may be anticipated when there is major impairment of the function of the kidney, liver, or heart. Creatinine clearance is a useful quantitative indicator of renal function. Conversely, drug clearance may be a useful indicator of the functional consequences of heart, kidney, or liver failure, often with greater precision than clinical findings or other laboratory tests. For example, when renal function is changing rapidly, estimation of the clearance of aminoglycoside antibiotics may be a more accurate indicator of glomerular filtration than serum creatinine.

Hepatic disease has been shown to reduce the clearance and prolong the half-life of many drugs. However, for many other drugs known to be eliminated by hepatic processes, no changes in clearance or half-life have been noted with similar hepatic disease. This reflects the fact that hepatic disease does not always affect the hepatic intrinsic clearance. At present, there is no reliable marker of hepatic drug-metabolizing function that can be used to predict changes in liver clearance in a manner analogous to the use of creatinine clearance as a marker of renal drug clearance.

\section*{VOLUME OF DISTRIBUTION}

The apparent volume of distribution reflects a balance between binding to tissues, which decreases plasma concentration and makes the apparent volume larger, and binding to plasma proteins, which increases plasma concentration and makes the apparent volume smaller. Changes in either tissue or plasma binding can change the apparent volume of distribution determined from plasma concentration measurements. Older people have a relative decrease in skeletal muscle mass and tend to have a smaller apparent volume of distribution of digoxin (which binds to muscle proteins). The volume of distribution may be overestimated
in obese patients if based on body weight and the drug does not enter fatty tissues well, as is the case with digoxin. In contrast, theophylline has a volume of distribution similar to that of total body water. Adipose tissue has almost as much water in it as other tissues, so that the apparent total volume of distribution of theophylline is proportional to body weight even in obese patients.

Abnormal accumulation of fluid-edema, ascites, pleural effusion-can markedly increase the volume of distribution of drugs such as gentamicin that are hydrophilic and have small volumes of distribution.

\section*{hALF-LIFE}

The differences between clearance and half-life are important in defining the underlying mechanisms for the effect of a disease state on drug disposition. For example, the half-life of diazepam increases with age. When clearance is related to age, it is found that clearance of this drug does not change with age. The increasing half-life for diazepam actually results from changes in the volume of distribution with age; the metabolic processes responsible for eliminating the drug are fairly constant.

\section*{Pharmacodynamic Variables}

\section*{MAXI MUM EFFECT}

All pharmacologic responses must have a maximum effect ( $E_{\max }$ ). No matter how high the drug concentration goes, a point will be reached beyond which no further increment in response is achieved.

If increasing the dose in a particular patient does not lead to a further clinical response, it is possible that the maximum effect has been reached. Recognition of maximum effect is helpful in avoiding ineffectual increases of dose with the attendant risk of toxicity.

\section*{SENSI TI VITY}

The sensitivity of the target organ to drug concentration is reflected by the concentration required to produce $50 \%$ of maximum effect, the $\mathrm{EC}_{50}$. Failure of response due to diminished sensitivity to the drug can be detected by measuring-in a patient who is not getting better-drug concentrations that are usually associated with therapeutic response. This may be a result of abnormal physiology-eg, hyperkalemia diminishes responsiveness to digoxin-or drug antagonism-eg, calcium channel blockers impair the inotropic response to digoxin.

Increased sensitivity to a drug is usually signaled by exaggerated responses to small or moderate doses. The pharmacodynamic nature of this sensitivity can be confirmed by measuring drug concentrations that are low in relation to the observed effect.

\section*{I NTERPRETATI ON OF DRUG CONCENTRATI ON MEASUREMENTS}

\section*{Clearance}

Clearance is the single most important factor determining drug concentrations. The interpretation of measurements of drug concentrations depends on a clear understanding of three factors that may influence clearance: the dose, the organ blood flow, and the intrinsic function of the liver or kidneys. Each of these factors should be considered when interpreting clearance estimated from a drug concentration measurement. It must also be recognized that changes in protein binding may lead the unwary to believe there is a change in clearance when in fact drug elimination is not altered (see Plasma Protein Binding: Is It Important?). Factors affecting protein binding include the following:
(1) Albumin concentration: Drugs such as phenytoin, salicylates, and disopyramide are extensively bound to plasma albumin. Albumin levels are low in many disease states, resulting in lower total drug concentrations.
(2) Alpha ${ }_{1}$-acid glycoprotein concentration: $\sqsubset_{1}$-acid glycoprotein is an important binding protein with binding sites for drugs such as quinidine, lidocaine, and propranolol. It is increased in acute inflammatory disorders and causes major changes in total plasma concentration of these drugs even though drug elimination is unchanged.
(3) Capacity-limited protein binding: The binding of drugs to plasma proteins is capacity-limited. Therapeutic concentrations of salicylates and prednisolone show concentration-dependent protein binding. Because unbound drug concentration is determined by dosing rate and clearance-which is not altered, in the case of these low-extraction-ratio drugs, by protein binding-increases in dosing rate will cause corresponding changes in the pharmacodynamically important unbound concentration. Total drug concentration will increase less rapidly than the dosing rate would suggest as protein binding approaches saturation at higher concentrations.

\section*{PLASMA PROTEIN BINDING: IS IT IMPORTANT?}

Plasma protein binding is often mentioned as a factor playing a role in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and drug interactions. However, there are no clinically relevant examples of changes in drug disposition or effects that can be clearly ascribed to changes in plasma protein binding (Benet \& Hoener 2002). The idea that if a drug is displaced from plasma proteins it would increase the unbound drug concentration and increase the drug effect and, perhaps, produce toxicity seems a simple and obvious mechanism. Unfortunately, this simple theory, which is appropriate for a test tube, does not work in the body, which is an open system capable of eliminating unbound drug.

First, a seemingly dramatic change in the unbound fraction from $1 \%$ to $10 \%$ releases less than $5 \%$ of the total amount of drug in the body into the unbound pool because less than one third of the drug in the body is bound to plasma proteins even in the most extreme cases, eg, warfarin. Drug displaced from plasma protein will of course distribute throughout the volume of distribution, so that a $5 \%$ increase in the amount of unbound drug in the body produces at most a $5 \%$ increase in pharmacologically active unbound drug at the site of action.

Second, when the amount of unbound drug in plasma increases, the rate of elimination will increase (if unbound clearance is unchanged), and after four half-lives the unbound concentration will return to its previous steady-state value. When drug interactions associated with protein binding displacement and clinically important effects have been studied, it has been found that the displacing drug is also an inhibitor of clearance, and it is the change in clearance of the unbound drug that is the relevant mechanism explaining the interaction.

The clinical importance of plasma protein binding is only to help interpretation of measured drug concentrations. When plasma proteins are lower than normal, then total drug concentrations will be lower but unbound concentrations will not be affected.

\section*{Dosing History}

An accurate dosing history is essential if one is to obtain maximum value from a drug concentration measurement. In fact, if the dosing history is unknown or incomplete, a drug concentration measurement loses all predictive value.

\section*{Timing of Samples for Concentration Measurement}

Information about the rate and extent of drug absorption in a particular patient is rarely of great clinical importance. However, absorption usually occurs during the first 2 hours after a drug dose and varies according to food intake, posture, and activity. Therefore, it is important to avoid drawing blood until absorption is complete (about 2 hours after an oral dose). Attempts to measure peak concentrations early after oral dosing are usually unsuccessful and compromise the validity of the measurement, because one cannot be certain that absorption is complete.

Some drugs such as digoxin and lithium take several hours to distribute to tissues. Digoxin samples should be taken at least 6 hours after the last dose and lithium just before the next dose (usually 24 hours after the last dose). Aminoglycosides distribute quite rapidly, but it is still prudent to wait 1 hour after giving the dose before taking a sample.

Clearance is readily estimated from the dosing rate and mean steady-state concentration. Blood samples should be appropriately timed to estimate steady-state concentration. Provided steady state has been approached (at least three half-lives of constant dosing), a sample obtained near the midpoint of the dosing interval will usually be close to the mean steady-state concentration.

\section*{Initial Predictions of Volume of Distribution \& Clearance VOLUME OF DISTRIBUTION}

Volume of distribution is commonly calculated for a particular patient using body weight ( 70 kg body weight is assumed for the values in Table 3-1). If a patient is obese, drugs that do not readily penetrate fat (eg, gentamicin and digoxin) should have their volumes calculated from ideal body weight as shown below:

Patients with edema, ascites, or pleural effusions offer a larger volume of distribution to the aminoglycoside antibiotics (eg, gentamicin) than is predicted by body weight. In such patients, the weight should be corrected as follows: Subtract an estimate of the weight of the excess fluid accumulation from the measured weight. Use the resultant "normal" body weight to calculate the normal volume of distribution. Finally, this normal volume should be increased by 1 L for each estimated kilogram of excess fluid. This correction is important because of the relatively small volumes of distribution of these water-soluble drugs.

\section*{CLEARANCE}

Drugs cleared by the renal route often require adjustment of clearance in proportion to renal function. This can be conveniently estimated from the creatinine clearance, calculated from a single serum creatinine measurement and the predicted creatinine production rate.

The predicted creatinine production rate in women is $85 \%$ of the calculated value, because they have a smaller muscle mass per kilogram and it is muscle mass that determines creatinine production. Muscle mass as a fraction of body weight decreases with age, which is why age appears in the Cockcroft-Gault
equation.*
The decrease of renal function with age is independent of the decrease in creatinine production. Because of the difficulty of obtaining complete urine collections, creatinine clearance calculated in this way is at least as reliable as estimates based on urine collections. Ideal body weight should be used for obese patients, and correction should be made for muscle wasting in severely ill patients.
*The Cockcroft-Gault equation is given in Chapter 61.

\section*{Revising Individual Estimates of Volume of Distribution \& Clearance}

The commonsense approach to the interpretation of drug concentrations compares predictions of pharmacokinetic parameters and expected concentrations to measured values. If measured concentrations differ by more than $20 \%$ from predicted values, revised estimates of $V_{d}$ or CL for that patient should be calculated using equation (1) or equation (2). If the change calculated is more than a $100 \%$ increase or $50 \%$ decrease in either $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{d}}$ or CL , the assumptions made about the timing of the sample and the dosing history should be critically examined.

For example, if a patient is taking 0.25 mg of digoxin a day, a clinician may expect the digoxin concentration to be about $1 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$. This is based on typical values for bioavailability of $70 \%$ and total clearance of about $7 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{h}$ ( $\mathrm{CL}_{\text {renal }} 4 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{h}, \mathrm{CL}_{\text {nonrenal }} 3 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{h}$ ). If the patient has heart failure, the nonrenal (hepatic) clearance might be halved because of hepatic congestion and hypoxia, so the expected clearance would become $5.5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{h}$. The concentration is then expected to be about $1.3 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$. Suppose that the concentration actually measured is $2 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$. Commonsense would suggest halving the daily dose to achieve a target concentration of $1 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$. This approach implies a revised clearance of $3.5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{h}$. The smaller clearance compared with the expected value of $5.5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{h}$ may reflect additional renal functional impairment due to heart failure.

This technique will often be misleading if steady state has not been reached. At least a week of regular dosing (three to four half-lives) must elapse before the implicit method will be reliable.

\section*{DRUG BIOTRANSFORMATION: INTRODUCTION}

Humans are exposed daily to a wide variety of foreign compounds called xenobiotics-substances absorbed across the lungs or skin or, more commonly, ingested either unintentionally as compounds present in food and drink or deliberately as drugs for therapeutic or "recreational" purposes. Exposure to environmental xenobiotics may be inadvertent and accidental or-when they are present as components of air, water, and food-inescapable. Some xenobiotics are innocuous, but many can provoke biologic responses. Such biologic responses often depend on conversion of the absorbed substance into an active metabolite. The discussion that follows is applicable to xenobiotics in general (including drugs) and to some extent to endogenous compounds.

\section*{WHY IS DRUG BIOTRANSFORMATI ON NECESSARY?}

Renal excretion plays a pivotal role in terminating the biologic activity of some drugs, particularly those that have small molecular volumes or possess polar characteristics such as functional groups that are fully ionized at physiologic pH. However, many drugs do not possess such physicochemical properties. Pharmacologically active organic molecules tend to be lipophilic and remain un-ionized or only partially ionized at physiologic pH ; these are readily reabsorbed from the glomerular filtrate in the nephron. Certain lipophilic compounds are often strongly bound to plasma proteins and may not be readily filtered at the glomerulus. Consequently, most drugs would have a prolonged duration of action if termination of their action depended solely on renal excretion.

An alternative process that can lead to the termination or alteration of biologic activity is metabolism. In general, lipophilic xenobiotics are transformed to more polar and hence more readily excreted products. The role metabolism plays in the inactivation of lipid-soluble drugs can be quite dramatic. For example, lipophilic barbiturates such as thiopental and pentobarbital would have extremely long halflives if it were not for their metabolic conversion to more water-soluble compounds.

Metabolic products are often less pharmacodynamically active than the parent drug and may even be inactive. However, some biotransformation products have enhanced activity or toxic properties. It is noteworthy that the synthesis of endogenous substrates such as steroid hormones, cholesterol, active vitamin D congeners, and bile acids involves many pathways catalyzed by enzymes associated with the metabolism of xenobiotics. Finally, drug-metabolizing enzymes have been exploited in the design of pharmacologically inactive prodrugs that are converted to active molecules in the body.

\section*{THE ROLE OF BIOTRANSFORMATION IN DRUG DISPOSITION}

Most metabolic biotransformations occur at some point between absorption of the drug into the general circulation and its renal elimination. A few transformations occur in the intestinal lumen or intestinal wall. In general, all of these reactions can be assigned to one of two major categories called phase I and phase II reactions (Figure 4-1).

Figure 4-1.

Phase I reactions usually convert the parent drug to a more polar metabolite by introducing or unmasking a functional group ( $-\mathrm{OH},-\mathrm{NH}_{2},-\mathrm{SH}$ ). Often these metabolites are inactive, although in some instances activity is only modified or even enhanced.

If phase I metabolites are sufficiently polar, they may be readily excreted. However, many phase I products are not eliminated rapidly and undergo a subsequent reaction in which an endogenous substrate such as glucuronic acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, or an amino acid combines with the newly incorporated functional group to form a highly polar conjugate. Such conjugation or synthetic reactions are the hallmarks of phase II metabolism. A great variety of drugs undergo these sequential biotransformation reactions, although in some instances the parent drug may already possess a functional group that may form a conjugate directly. For example, the hydrazide moiety of isoniazid is known to form an N -acetyl conjugate in a phase II reaction. This conjugate is then a substrate for a phase I type reaction, namely, hydrolysis to isonicotinic acid (Figure 4-2). Thus, phase II reactions may actually precede phase I reactions.

\section*{WHERE DO DRUG BIOTRANSFORMATI ONS OCCUR?}

Although every tissue has some ability to metabolize drugs, the liver is the principal organ of drug metabolism. Other tissues that display considerable activity include the gastrointestinal tract, the lungs, the skin, and the kidneys. Following oral administration, many drugs (eg, isoproterenol, meperidine, pentazocine, morphine) are absorbed intact from the small intestine and transported first via the portal system to the liver, where they undergo extensive metabolism. This process is called the first-pass effect (see Chapter 3). Some orally administered drugs (eg, clonazepam, chlorpromazine, cyclosporine) are more extensively metabolized in the intestine than in the liver, whereas others (eg, midazolam) undergo significant ( $50 \%$ ) intestinal metabolism. Thus, intestinal metabolism can contribute to the overall first-pass effect, and individuals with compromised liver function may increasingly rely on such intestinal metabolism for drug elimination. First-pass effects may so greatly limit the bioavailability of orally administered drugs (eg, lidocaine) that alternative routes of administration must be used to achieve therapeutically effective blood levels. Furthermore, the lower gut harbors intestinal microorganisms that are capable of many biotransformation reactions. In addition, drugs may be metabolized by gastric acid (eg, penicillin), by digestive enzymes (eg, polypeptides such as insulin), or by enzymes in the wall of the intestine (eg, sympathomimetic catecholamines).

Although drug biotransformation in vivo can occur by spontaneous, noncatalyzed chemical reactions,
the vast majority of transformations are catalyzed by specific cellular enzymes. At the subcellular level, these enzymes may be located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, cytosol, lysosomes, or even the nuclear envelope or plasma membrane.

\section*{MI CROSOMAL MI XED FUNCTI ON OXI DASE SYSTEM \& PHASE I REACTI ONS}

Many drug-metabolizing enzymes are located in the lipophilic ER membranes of the liver and other tissues. When these lamellar membranes are isolated by homogenization and fractionation of the cell, they re-form into vesicles called microsomes. Microsomes retain most of the morphologic and functional characteristics of the intact membranes, including the rough and smooth surface features of the rough (ribosome-studded) and smooth (no ribosomes) ER. Whereas the rough microsomes tend to be dedicated to protein synthesis, the smooth microsomes are relatively rich in enzymes responsible for oxidative drug metabolism. In particular, they contain the important class of enzymes known as the mixed function oxidases (MFOs), or monooxygenases. The activity of these enzymes requires both a reducing agent (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NADPH]) and molecular oxygen; in a typical reaction, one molecule of oxygen is consumed (reduced) per substrate molecule, with one oxygen atom appearing in the product and the other in the form of water.

In this oxidation-reduction process, two microsomal enzymes play a key role. The first of these is a flavoprotein, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase. One mole of this enzyme contains 1 mol each of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The second microsomal enzyme is a hemoprotein called cytochrome P450, which serves as the terminal oxidase. In fact, the microsomal membrane harbors multiple forms of this hemoprotein, and this multiplicity is increased by repeated administration of exogenous chemicals (see below). The name cytochrome P450 (abbreviated as CYP or P450) is derived from the spectral properties of this hemoprotein. In its reduced (ferrous) form, it binds carbon monoxide to give a complex that absorbs light maximally at 450 nm . The relative abundance of P450s, compared with that of the reductase in the liver, contributes to making P450 heme reduction a rate-limiting step in hepatic drug oxidations.

Microsomal drug oxidations require P450, P450 reductase, NADPH, and molecular oxygen. A simplified scheme of the oxidative cycle is presented in Figure 4-3. Briefly, oxidized ( $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ ) P450 combines with a drug substrate to form a binary complex (step 1). NADPH donates an electron to the flavoprotein P450 reductase, which in turn reduces the oxidized P450-drug complex (step 2). A second electron is introduced from NADPH via the same P450 reductase, which serves to reduce molecular oxygen and to form an "activated oxygen"-P450-substrate complex (step 3). This complex in turn transfers activated oxygen to the drug substrate to form the oxidized product (step 4).

The potent oxidizing properties of this activated oxygen permit oxidation of a large number of substrates. Substrate specificity is very low for this enzyme complex. High lipid solubility is the only common structural feature of the wide variety of structurally unrelated drugs and chemicals that serve as substrates in this system (Table 4-1).

\section*{Human Liver P450 Enzymes}

Immunoblotting analyses, combined with the use of relatively selective functional markers and selective P450 inhibitors, have identified numerous P450 isoforms (CYP: 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9,

2C18, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, 3A5, 4A11, and 7) in human liver microsomal preparations. Of these, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 appear to be the most important forms, accounting for approximately, $15 \%, 4 \%, 20 \%, 5 \%, 10 \%$, and $30 \%$, respectively, of the total human liver P450 content. Together, they are responsible for catalyzing the bulk of the hepatic drug and xenobiotic metabolism (Table 4-2).

${ }^{1}$ CYP3A5 has similar substrate and inhibitor profiles, but except for a few drugs is generally less active than CYP3A4.

It is noteworthy that CYP3A4 alone is responsible for the metabolism of over 50\% of the clinically prescribed drugs metabolized by the liver. The involvement of individual P450s in the metabolism of a given drug may be screened in vitro by means of selective functional markers, selective chemical P450 inhibitors, and anti-P450 antibodies. In vivo, such screening may be accomplished by means of relatively selective noninvasive markers, which include breath tests or urinary analyses of specific metabolites after administration of a P450-selective substrate probe.

\section*{Enzyme I nduction}

Some of the chemically dissimilar P450 substrate drugs, on repeated administration, induce P450 by enhancing the rate of its synthesis or reducing its rate of degradation (Table 4-2). Induction results in an acceleration of substrate metabolism and usually in a decrease in the pharmacologic action of the inducer and also of coadministered drugs. However, in the case of drugs metabolically transformed to reactive metabolites, enzyme induction may exacerbate metabolite-mediated toxicity.

Various substrates induce P450 isoforms having different molecular masses and exhibiting different substrate specificities and immunochemical and spectral characteristics.

Environmental pollutants are also capable of inducing P450 enzymes. As noted above, exposure to benzo[a]pyrene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are present in tobacco smoke, charcoal-broiled meat, and other organic pyrolysis products, is known to induce CYP1A enzymes and to alter the rates of drug metabolism. Other environmental chemicals known to induce specific P450s include the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were once used widely in industry as insulating
materials and plasticizers, and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin, TCDD), a trace byproduct of the chemical synthesis of the defoliant $2,4,5-\mathrm{T}$ (see Chapter 57).

Increased P450 synthesis requires enhanced transcription and translation. A cytoplasmic receptor (termed AhR) for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (eg, benzo[a]pyrene, dioxin) has been identified, and the translocation of the inducer-receptor complex into the nucleus and subsequent activation of regulatory elements of genes have been documented. A pregnane $X$ receptor (PXR), a member of the steroid-retinoid-thyroid hormone receptor family, has recently been shown to mediate CYP3A induction by various chemicals (dexamethasone, rifampin) in the liver and intestinal mucosa. A similar receptor, the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) has been identified for the phenobarbital class of inducers.

P450 enzymes may also be induced by substrate stabilization, ie, decreased degradation, as is the case with troleandomycin- or clotrimazole-mediated induction of CYP3A enzymes and the ethanolmediated induction of CYP2E1.

\section*{Enzyme Inhibition}

Certain drug substrates inhibit cytochrome P450 enzyme activity (Table 4-2). Imidazole-containing drugs such as cimetidine and ketoconazole bind tightly to the P450 heme iron and effectively reduce the metabolism of endogenous substrates (eg, testosterone) or other coadministered drugs through competitive inhibition. However, macrolide antibiotics such as troleandomycin, erythromycin, and erythromycin derivatives are metabolized, apparently by CYP3A, to metabolites that complex the cytochrome P450 heme-iron and render it catalytically inactive. Another compound that acts through this mechanism is the inhibitor proadifen (SKF-525-A, used in research), which binds tightly to the heme iron and quasi-irreversibly inactivates the enzyme, thereby inhibiting the metabolism of potential substrates.

Some substrates irreversibly inhibit P450s via covalent interaction of a metabolically generated reactive intermediate that may react with the P450 apoprotein or heme moiety or even cause the heme to fragment and irreversibly modify the apoprotein. The antibiotic chloramphenicol is metabolized by CYP2B1 to a species that modifies its protein and thus also inactivates the enzyme. A growing list of such suicide inhibitors-inactivators that attack the heme or the protein moiety-includes certain steroids (ethinyl estradiol, norethindrone, and spironolactone); fluroxene; allobarbital; the analgesic sedatives allylisopropylacetylurea, diethylpentenamide, and ethchlorvynol; carbon disulfide; grapefruit furanocoumarins; deprenyl; phencyclidine; ticlopidine and clopidogrel; ritonavir, and propylthiouracil. On the other hand, the barbiturate secobarbital is found to inactivate CYP2B1 by modification of both its heme and protein moieties. Other metabolically activated drugs whose P450 inactivation mechanism is not fully elucidated include mifepristone (RU-486), troglitazone, raloxifene, and tamoxifen.

\section*{PHASE II REACTIONS}

Parent drugs or their phase I metabolites that contain suitable chemical groups often undergo coupling or conjugation reactions with an endogenous substance to yield drug conjugates (Table 4-3). In general, conjugates are polar molecules that are readily excreted and often inactive. Conjugate formation involves high-energy intermediates and specific transfer enzymes. Such enzymes (transferases) may be located in microsomes or in the cytosol. They catalyze the coupling of an
activated endogenous substance (such as the uridine 5'-diphosphate [UDP] derivative of glucuronic acid) with a drug (or endogenous compound), or of an activated drug (such as the S-CoA derivative of benzoic acid) with an endogenous substrate. Because the endogenous substrates originate in the diet, nutrition plays a critical role in the regulation of drug conjugations.

\end{tabular}

Drug conjugations were once believed to represent terminal inactivation events and as such have been viewed as "true detoxification" reactions. However, this concept must be modified, because it is now known that certain conjugation reactions (acyl glucuronidation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, O-sulfation of N-hydroxyacetylaminofluorene, and N-acetylation of isoniazid) may lead to the formation of reactive species responsible for the toxicity of the drugs. Furthermore, sulfation is known to activate the orally active prodrug minoxidil into a very efficacious vasodilator and morphine-6-glucuronide is more potent than morphine itself.

\section*{METABOLI SM OF DRUGS TO TOXI C PRODUCTS}

Metabolism of drugs and other foreign chemicals may not always be an innocuous biochemical event leading to detoxification and elimination of the compound. Indeed, as noted above, several compounds have been shown to be metabolically transformed to reactive intermediates that are toxic to various organs. Such toxic reactions may not be apparent at low levels of exposure to parent compounds when alternative detoxification mechanisms are not yet overwhelmed or compromised and the availability of endogenous detoxifying cosubstrates (glutathione [GSH], glucuronic acid, sulfate) is not limited. However, when these resources are exhausted, the toxic pathway may prevail, resulting in overt organ toxicity or carcinogenesis. The number of specific examples of such drug-induced toxicity is expanding rapidly. An example is acetaminophen (paracetamol)-induced hepatotoxicity (Figure 4-4). This analgesic antipyretic drug is quite safe in therapeutic doses ( $1.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d}$ for an adult). It normally undergoes glucuronidation and sulfation to the corresponding conjugates, which together comprise $95 \%$ of the total excreted metabolites. The alternative P450-dependent GSH conjugation pathway accounts for the remaining $5 \%$. When acetaminophen intake far exceeds therapeutic doses, the glucuronidation and sulfation pathways are saturated, and the P450-dependent pathway becomes increasingly important. Little or no hepatotoxicity results as long as GSH is available for conjugation. However, with time, hepatic GSH is depleted faster than it can be regenerated, and a reactive, toxic metabolite accumulates. In the absence of intracellular nucleophiles such as GSH, this reactive metabolite ( N -acetylbenzoiminoquinone) reacts with nucleophilic groups of cellular proteins, resulting in hepatotoxicity.

Metabolism of acetaminophen (top center) to hepatotoxic metabolites. (GSH, glutathione; SG, glutathione moiety).

The chemical and toxicologic characterization of the electrophilic nature of the reactive acetaminophen metabolite has led to the development of effective antidotes-cysteamine and N -acetylcysteine.
Administration of N -acetylcysteine (the safer of the two) within 8-16 hours following acetaminophen overdosage has been shown to protect victims from fulminant hepatotoxicity and death (see Chapter 59). Administration of GSH is not effective because it does not cross cell membranes readily.

\section*{CLI NI CAL RELEVANCE OF DRUG METABOLI SM}

The dose and frequency of administration required to achieve effective therapeutic blood and tissue levels vary in different patients because of individual differences in drug distribution and rates of drug metabolism and elimination. These differences are determined by genetic factors and nongenetic variables such as age, sex, liver size, liver function, circadian rhythm, body temperature, and nutritional and environmental factors such as concomitant exposure to inducers or inhibitors of drug metabolism. The discussion that follows summarizes the most important of these variables.

\section*{Individual Differences}

Individual differences in metabolic rate depend on the nature of the drug itself. Thus, within the same population, steady-state plasma levels may reflect a 30-fold variation in the metabolism of one drug and only a two-fold variation in the metabolism of another.

\section*{Genetic Factors}

Genetic factors that influence enzyme levels account for some of these differences. Succinylcholine, for example, is metabolized only half as rapidly in persons with genetically determined defects in pseudocholinesterase as in persons with normally functioning pseudocholinesterase. Analogous pharmacogenetic differences are seen in the acetylation of isoniazid and the hydroxylation of warfarin. The defect in slow acetylators (of isoniazid and similar amines) appears to be caused by the synthesis of less of the enzyme rather than of an abnormal form of it. Inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, the slow acetylator phenotype occurs in about $50 \%$ of blacks and whites in the USA, more frequently in Europeans living in high northern latitudes, and much less commonly in Asians and Inuits (Eskimos). Similarly, genetically determined defects in the oxidative metabolism of debrisoquin, phenacetin, guanoxan, sparteine, phenformin, warfarin, and others have been reported (Table 4-4). The defects are apparently transmitted as autosomal recessive traits and may be expressed at any one of the multiple metabolic transformations that a chemical might undergo.

\footnotetext{
${ }^{1}$ Observed or predictable.
Of the several recognized genetic varieties of drug metabolism polymorphisms, three have been
}
particularly well characterized and afford some insight into possible underlying mechanisms. First is the debrisoquin-sparteine oxidation type of polymorphism, which apparently occurs in $3-10 \%$ of whites and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. In affected individuals, the CYP2D6-dependent oxidations of debrisoquin and other drugs (see Table 4-2; Figure 4-5) are impaired. These defects in oxidative drug metabolism are probably coinherited. The precise molecular basis for the defect appears to be faulty expression of the P450 protein, resulting in little or no isoform-catalyzed drug metabolism. More recently, however, another polymorphic genotype has been reported that results in ultrarapid metabolism of relevant drugs due to the presence of 2D6 allelic variants with up to 13 gene copies in tandem. This genotype is most common in Ethiopians and Saudi Arabians, populations that display it in up to one third of individuals. As a result, these subjects require twofold to threefold higher daily doses of nortriptyline (a 2D6 substrate) to achieve therapeutic plasma levels. Conversely, in these ultrarapidly metabolizing populations, the prodrug codeine (another 2D6 substrate) is metabolized much faster to morphine, often resulting in undesirable adverse effects of morphine, such as abdominal pain.

Genetic polymorphism in debrisoquin 4-hydroxylation by CYP2D6 in a Caucasian population. The semilog frequency distribution histogram of the metabolic ratio (MR; defined as percent of dose excreted as unchanged debrisoquin divided by the percent of dose excreted as 4-hydroxydebrisoquin metabolite) in the 8-hour urine collected after oral ingestion of 12.8 mg debrisoquin sulfate (equivalent to 10 mg free debrisoquin base). Individuals with MR values > 12.6 were phenotyped as poor metabolizers (PM, dark gray bars), and those with MR values < 12.6 but > 0.2 were designated extensive metabolizers (EM, light color bars). Those with MR values < 0.2 were designated as ultrarapid metabolizers (URM, dark color bars) based on the MR values (0.01-0.1) of individuals with documented multiple copies of CYP2D6 allelic variants resulting from inherited amplification of this gene. (Data from Woolhouse et al: Debrisoquin hydroxylation polymorphism among Ghanians and Caucasians. Clin Pharmacol Ther 1979; 26: 584.)

A second well-studied genetic drug polymorphism involves the stereoselective aromatic (4)-
hydroxylation of the anticonvulsant mephenytoin, catalyzed by CYP2C19. This polymorphism, which is also inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, occurs in $3-5 \%$ of Caucasians and $18-23 \%$ of Japanese populations. It is genetically independent of the debrisoquin-sparteine polymorphism. In normal "extensive metabolizers," (S)-mephenytoin is extensively hydroxylated by CYP2C19 at the 4 position of the phenyl ring before its glucuronidation and rapid excretion in the urine, whereas (R)mephenytoin is slowly N-demethylated to nirvanol, an active metabolite. "Poor metabolizers," however, appear to totally lack the stereospecific (S)-mephenytoin hydroxylase activity, so both (S)- and (R)mephenytoin enantiomers are N-demethylated to nirvanol, which accumulates in much higher concentrations. Thus, poor metabolizers of mephenytoin show signs of profound sedation and ataxia after doses of the drug that are well tolerated by normal metabolizers. The molecular basis for this defect is a single base pair mutation in exon 5 of the CYP2C19 gene that creates an aberrant splice site, a correspondingly altered reading frame of the mRNA, and, finally, a truncated, nonfunctional protein. It is clinically important to recognize that the safety of a drug may be severely reduced in individuals who are poor metabolizers.

The third recently characterized genetic polymorphism is that of CYP2C9. Two well-characterized variants of this enzyme exist, each with amino acid mutations that result in altered metabolism. The CYP2C9*2 allele encodes an Arg144Cys mutation, exhibiting impaired functional interactions with P450 reductase. The other allelic variant, CYP2C9*3, encodes an enzyme with an Ile359Leu mutation that has lowered affinity for many substrates. For example, individuals displaying the CYP2C9*3 phenotype have greatly reduced tolerance for the anticoagulant warfarin. The warfarin clearance in CYP2C9*3-homozygous individuals is about $10 \%$ of normal values, and these people have a much lower tolerance for the drug than those who are homozygous for the normal wild-type allele. These individuals also have a much higher risk of adverse effects with warfarin (eg, bleeding) and with other CYP2C9 substrates such as phenytoin, losartan, tolbutamide, and some NSAIDs.

Allelic variants of CYP3A4 have also been reported but their contribution to its well-known interindividual variability in drug metabolism apparently is limited. On the other hand, the expression of CYP3A5, another human liver isoform, is markedly polymorphic, ranging from $0 \%$ to $100 \%$ of the total hepatic CYP3A content. This CYP3A5 protein polymorphism is now known to result from a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within intron 3, which enables normally spliced CYP3A5 transcripts in $5 \%$ of Caucasians, $29 \%$ of Japanese, $27 \%$ of Chinese, $30 \%$ of Koreans, and $73 \%$ of African Americans. Thus, it can significantly contribute to interindividual differences in the metabolism of preferential CYP3A5 substrates such as midazolam.

Additional genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolism (eg, CYP2B6) that are inherited independently from those already described are being discovered. Studies of theophylline metabolism in monozygotic and dizygotic twins that included pedigree analysis of various families have revealed that a distinct polymorphism may exist for this drug and may be inherited as a recessive genetic trait. Genetic drug metabolism polymorphisms also appear to occur for aminopyrine and carbocysteine oxidations. Regularly updated information on human P450-polymorphisms is available at www.imm.ki.se/CYPalleles/.

Although genetic polymorphisms in drug oxidations often involve specific P450 enzymes, such genetic variations can also occur in other enzymes. Recent descriptions of a polymorphism in the oxidation of trimethylamine, believed to be metabolized largely by the flavin monooxygenase (Ziegler's
enzyme), suggest that genetic variants of other non-P450-dependent oxidative enzymes may also contribute to such polymorphisms.

\section*{Diet \& Environmental Factors}

Diet and environmental factors contribute to individual variations in drug metabolism. Charcoal-broiled foods and cruciferous vegetables are known to induce CYP1A enzymes, whereas grapefruit juice is known to inhibit the CYP3A metabolism of coadministered drug substrates (Table 4-2). Cigarette smokers metabolize some drugs more rapidly than nonsmokers because of enzyme induction (see previous section). Industrial workers exposed to some pesticides metabolize certain drugs more rapidly than nonexposed individuals. Such differences make it difficult to determine effective and safe doses of drugs that have narrow therapeutic indices.

\section*{Age \& Sex}

Increased susceptibility to the pharmacologic or toxic activity of drugs has been reported in very young and very old patients compared with young adults (see Chapters 60 and 61). Although this may reflect differences in absorption, distribution, and elimination, differences in drug metabolism also play a role. Slower metabolism could be due to reduced activity of metabolic enzymes or reduced availability of essential endogenous cofactors.

Sex-dependent variations in drug metabolism have been well documented in rats but not in other rodents. Young adult male rats metabolize drugs much faster than mature female rats or prepubertal male rats. These differences in drug metabolism have been clearly associated with androgenic hormones. Clinical reports suggest that similar sex-dependent differences in drug metabolism also exist in humans for ethanol, propranolol, some benzodiazepines, estrogens, and salicylates.

\section*{Drug-Drug Interactions during Metabolism}

Many substrates, by virtue of their relatively high lipophilicity, are retained not only at the active site of the enzyme but remain nonspecifically bound to the lipid ER membrane. In this state, they may induce microsomal enzymes, particularly after repeated use. Acutely, depending on the residual drug levels at the active site, they also may competitively inhibit metabolism of a simultaneously administered drug.

Enzyme-inducing drugs include various sedative-hypnotics, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, the antitubercular drug rifampin, and insecticides (Table 4-5). Patients who routinely ingest barbiturates, other sedative-hypnotics, or certain antipsychotic drugs may require considerably higher doses of warfarin to maintain a therapeutic effect. On the other hand, discontinuance of the sedative inducer may result in reduced metabolism of the anticoagulant and bleeding-a toxic effect of the ensuing enhanced plasma levels of the anticoagulant. Similar interactions have been observed in individuals receiving various combinations of drug regimens such as rifampin, antipsychotics, or sedatives with contraceptive agents, sedatives with anticonvulsant drugs, and even alcohol with hypoglycemic drugs (tolbutamide).

\hline
\end{tabular}
${ }^{1}$ Secobarbital is an exception. See Table 4-6 and text.
${ }^{2}$ With chronic (repeated) administration; acutely, ritonavir is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor/inactivator.
It must also be noted that an inducer may enhance not only the metabolism of other drugs but also its own metabolism. Thus, continued use of some drugs may result in a pharmacokinetic type of tolerance-progressively reduced therapeutic effectiveness due to enhancement of their own metabolism.

Conversely, simultaneous administration of two or more drugs may result in impaired elimination of the more slowly metabolized drug and prolongation or potentiation of its pharmacologic effects (Table 4-6). Both competitive substrate inhibition and irreversible substrate-mediated enzyme inactivation may augment plasma drug levels and lead to toxic effects from drugs with narrow therapeutic indices. Indeed, such acute interactions of terfenadine (a second-generation antihistamine) with a CYP3A4
substrate-inhibitor (ketoconazole, erythromycin, or grapefruit juice) resulted in fatal cardiac arrhythmias (torsade de pointes) requiring its withdrawal from the market. Similar drug-drug interactions with CYP3A4 substrate-inhibitors (such as the antibiotics erythromycin and clarithromycin, the antidepressant nefazodone, the antifungals itraconazole and ketoconazole, and the HIV protease inhibitors indinavir and ritonavir), and consequent cardiotoxicity led to withdrawal or restricted use of the $5-\mathrm{HT}_{4}$ agonist, cisapride. Similarly, allopurinol both prolongs the duration and enhances the chemotherapeutic and toxic actions of mercaptopurine by competitive inhibition of xanthine oxidase. Consequently, to avoid bone marrow toxicity, the dose of mercaptopurine must be reduced in patients receiving allopurinol. Cimetidine, a drug used in the treatment of peptic ulcer, has been shown to potentiate the pharmacologic actions of anticoagulants and sedatives. The metabolism of the sedative chlordiazepoxide has been shown to be inhibited by $63 \%$ after a single dose of cimetidine; such effects are reversed within 48 hours after withdrawal of cimetidine.

${ }^{1}$ While some inhibitors are selective for a given P450 enzyme, others are more general and can inhibit several P450s concurrently.
${ }^{2}$ Active components in grapefruit juice include furanocoumarins such as 6', 7'-dihydroxybergamottin (which inactivates both intestinal and liver CYP3A4) as well as other unknown components that inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated intestinal drug efflux and consequently further enhance the bioavailability of certain drugs such as cyclosporine.

Impaired metabolism may also result if a simultaneously administered drug irreversibly inactivates a common metabolizing enzyme. These inhibitors, in the course of their metabolism by cytochrome P450, inactivate the enzyme and result in impairment of their own metabolism and that of other cosubstrates.

\section*{Interactions between Drugs \& Endogenous Compounds}

As noted previously, some drugs require conjugation with endogenous substrates such as glutathione, glucuronic acid, or sulfate for their inactivation. Consequently, different drugs may compete for the same endogenous substrates, and the faster-reacting drug may effectively deplete endogenous substrate levels and impair the metabolism of the slower-reacting drug. If the latter has a steep doseresponse curve or a narrow margin of safety, potentiation of its pharmacologic and toxic effects may result.

\section*{Diseases Affecting Drug Metabolism}

Acute or chronic diseases that affect liver architecture or function markedly affect hepatic metabolism of some drugs. Such conditions include alcoholic hepatitis, active or inactive alcoholic cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, chronic active hepatitis, biliary cirrhosis, and acute viral or drug-induced hepatitis. Depending on their severity, these conditions may significantly impair hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes, particularly microsomal oxidases, and thereby markedly affect drug elimination. For example, the half-lives of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam in patients with liver cirrhosis or acute viral hepatitis are greatly increased, with a corresponding prolongation of their effects. Consequently, these drugs may cause coma in patients with liver disease when given in ordinary doses.

Some drugs are metabolized so readily that even marked reduction in liver function does not significantly prolong their action. However, cardiac disease, by limiting blood flow to the liver, may impair disposition of those drugs whose metabolism is flow-limited (Table 4-7). These drugs are so readily metabolized by the liver that hepatic clearance is essentially equal to liver blood flow. Pulmonary disease may also affect drug metabolism as indicated by the impaired hydrolysis of procainamide and procaine in patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency and the increased half-life of antipyrine in patients with lung cancer. The impaired enzyme activity or defective formation of enzymes associated with heavy metal poisoning or porphyria also results in reduced hepatic drug metabolism.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Table 4-7. Rapidly Metabolized Drugs Whose Hepatic Clearance Is Blood FlowLimited.} \\
\hline Alprenolol & Lidocaine \\
\hline Amitriptyline & Meperidine \\

\hline Desipramine & Pentazocine \\
\hline Imipramine & Propoxyphene \\
\hline Isoniazid & Propranolol \\
\hline Labetalol & Verapamil \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Although the effects of endocrine dysfunction on drug metabolism have been well explored in experimental animal models, corresponding data for humans with endocrine disorders are scanty. Thyroid dysfunction has been associated with altered metabolism of some drugs and of some endogenous compounds as well. Hypothyroidism increases the half-life of antipyrine, digoxin, methimazole, and some beta blockers, whereas hyperthyroidism has the opposite effect. A few clinical studies in diabetic patients indicate no apparent impairment of drug metabolism, although impairment has been noted in diabetic rats. Malfunctions of the pituitary, adrenal cortex, and gonads markedly reduce hepatic drug metabolism in rats. On the basis of these findings, it may be supposed that such disorders could significantly affect drug metabolism in humans. However, until sufficient evidence is obtained from clinical studies in patients, such extrapolations must be considered tentative.

\section*{DEVELOPMENT \& REGULATI ON OF DRUGS: I NTRODUCTION}

New drugs have revolutionized the practice of medicine, converting many once fatal or debilitating diseases into manageable therapeutic exercises. For example, deaths from cardiovascular disease, the main cause of death in the USA, and from stroke have decreased by more than $50 \%$ in the USA over the past 30 years. This decline is due-in part-to the discovery and increased use of antihypertensives, cholesterol synthesis inhibitors, drugs that prevent or dissolve blood clots, medical devices, and drug-releasing stents.

Among the first steps in the development of a new drug is the discovery or synthesis of a potential new drug molecule and seeking an understanding of its interaction (mechanism) with the appropriate biologic targets. Repeated application of this approach leads to compounds with increased potency and selectivity (Figure 5-1). By law, the safety and efficacy of drugs must be defined before marketing. In addition to in vitro studies, relevant biologic effects, drug metabolism, and pharmacokinetic profiles and particularly an assessment of the relative safety of the drug must be characterized in animals before human drug trials can be started. With regulatory approval, human testing can then go forward in three phases before the drug can be considered for approval for general use. A fourth phase of data gathering and safety monitoring is becoming increasingly important and follows after approval for general use.

The development and testing process required to bring a drug to market in the USA. Some of the requirements may be different for drugs used in life-threatening diseases.

Enormous and increasing costs, with estimates from $\$ 150$ million to $\$ 900$ million, are involved in the research and development of a single new drug that reaches the marketplace. Only 3 of 10 marketed drugs return their research and development (R\&D) investments, thus providing considerable motivation to develop "blockbusters." Thousands of compounds may be synthesized and hundreds of thousands tested from libraries of compounds for each successful new drug lead, which then generally needs to be further optimized for reasons of potency, selectivity, drug metabolism, and dosing convenience before each drug reaches the market. Because of the economic investment required and the need to efficiently access multiple technologies, most new drugs are developed in pharmaceutical companies.

At the same time, the incentives to succeed in drug development can be equally enormous. The global market for pharmaceuticals in 2006 is estimated at about $\$ 640$ billion. The 2004 sales of the top-selling drug worldwide (Lipitor) exceeded $\$ 10$ billion. During the second half of the 20th century, estimates indicate that medications produced by the pharmaceutical industry saved more than 1.5 million lives and $\$ 140$ billion in the costs of treatment for tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease alone. New drugs played a key role in the post-1995 decline in HIV mortality and the social returns for HIV drug innovation appear to be extremely large. In the USA, approximately $10 \%$ of the health care dollar is presently spent on prescription drugs.

\section*{DRUG DI SCOVERY}

Most new drugs or drug products are discovered or developed through one or more of six approaches:
1. Identification or elucidation of a new drug target
2. Rational drug design of a new drug based on an understanding of biologic mechanisms, drug receptor structure, and drug structure
3. Chemical modification of a known molecule
4. Screening for biologic activity of large numbers of natural products, banks of previously discovered chemical entities, and large libraries of peptides, nucleic acids, and other organic molecules
5. Biotechnology and cloning using genes to produce peptides and proteins. Efforts continue to focus on the discovery of new targets and approaches, from studies with genomics, proteomics, nucleic acids and molecular pharmacology for drug therapy. Significantly increasing the number of useful disease targets should be a positive driver for new and improved drugs.
6. Combinations of known drugs to obtain additive or synergistic effects or a repositioning of a known drug for a new therapeutic use.

\section*{Drug Screening}

Regardless of the source or the key idea leading to a drug candidate molecule, testing it involves a sequence of iterative experimentation and characterization called drug screening. A variety of biologic assays at the molecular, cellular, organ system, and whole animal levels are used to define the activity and selectivity of the drug (Table 5-1). The type and number of initial screening tests depend on the pharmacologic and therapeutic goal. Anti-infective drugs may be tested against a variety of infectious organisms some of which are resistant to standard agents, hypoglycemic drugs for their ability to lower blood sugar, etc. In addition, the molecule will also be studied for a broad array of other actions to
establish the mechanism of action and selectivity of the drug. This has the advantage of demonstrating both suspected and unsuspected toxic effects. Occasionally, an unsuspected therapeutic action is serendipitously discovered by the careful observer. The selection of molecules for further study is most efficiently conducted in animal models of human disease. Where good predictive preclinical models exist (eg, antibacterials, hypertension or thrombotic disease), we generally have adequate drugs. Good drugs or breakthough improvements are conspicuously lacking and slow for diseases for which pre-clinical models are poor, or not yet available, eg, Alzheimer's disease.

Studies are performed during drug screening to define the pharmacologic profile of the drug at the molecular, cellular, system, organ, and organism levels. For example, a broad range of tests would be performed on a drug designed to act as an antagonist at vascular a-adrenoceptors for the treatment of hypertension.

At the molecular level, the compound would be screened for receptor binding affinity to cell membranes containing areceptors (if possible on human receptors), other receptors, and binding sites on enzymes. If crystal structures of the drug and target are available, structural biology analyses or computer-assisted virtual screening might be done to better understand the drug receptor interaction. Early studies would be done to predict effects that might later cause undesired drug metabolism or toxicologic complications. For example, studies on liver cytochrome P450 enzymes would be performed to determine whether the drug of interest is likely to be a substrate or inhibitor of these enzymes or to interfere with the metabolism of other drugs. Effects on cardiac ion channels such as the hERG potassium channel, possibly predictive of life threatening arrhythmias, would be considered.

Effects on cell function would be studied to determine whether the drug is an agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist at areceptors. Isolated tissues, especially vascular smooth muscle, would be utilized to characterize the pharmacologic activity and selectivity of the new compound in comparison with reference compounds. Comparison with other drugs would also be undertaken in other in vitro preparations such as gastrointestinal and bronchial smooth muscle. At each step in this process, the compound would have to meet specific performance criteria to be carried further.

Whole animal studies are generally necessary to determine the effect of the drug on organ systems and disease models. Cardiovascular and renal function studies of all new drugs are generally first performed in normal animals. Where appropriate, studies on disease models would be performed. For a candidate antihypertensive drug, animals with hypertension would be treated to see if blood pressure was lowered in a dose-related manner and to characterize other effects of the compound. Evidence would be collected on duration of action and efficacy following oral and parenteral administration. If the agent possessed useful activity, it would be further studied for possible adverse effects on other major organ systems, including the respiratory, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and central nervous systems.

These studies might suggest the need for further chemical modification to achieve more desirable pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties. For example, oral administration studies might show that the drug was poorly absorbed or rapidly metabolized in the liver; modification to improve bioavailability might be indicated. If the drug was to be administered long-term, an assessment of tolerance development would be made. For drugs related to or having mechanisms of action similar to those known to cause physical dependence, abuse potential would also be studied. For each major action found, a pharmacologic mechanism would be sought.

The desired result of this screening procedure (which may have to be repeated several times with analogs or congeners of the original molecules) is called a lead compound, ie, a leading candidate for a successful new drug. A patent application would generally be filed for a novel compound (a composition of matter patent) that is efficacious, or for a new and nonobvious therapeutic use (a use patent) for a previously known chemical entity.

\section*{PRECLI NI CAL SAFETY \& TOXI CI TY TESTI NG}

All drugs are toxic at some dose. Seeking to correctly define the limiting toxicities of drugs and the therapeutic index comparing benefits and risks of a new drug might be argued as the most essential part of the new drug development process. Most drug candidates fail to reach the market, but the art of drug discovery and development is the effective assessment and management of risk and not total risk avoidance.

Candidate drugs that survive the initial screening and profiling procedures must be carefully evaluated for potential risks before and during clinical testing. Depending on the proposed use of the drug, preclinical toxicity testing includes most or all of the procedures shown in Table 5-2. Although no chemical can be certified as completely "safe" (free of risk), the objective is to estimate the risk associated with exposure to the drug candidate and to consider this in the context of therapeutic needs and duration of likely drug use.
Table 5-2. Safety Tests.

\section*{Type of Test Approach \\ Acute toxicity}

Acute dose that is lethal in approximately $50 \%$ of animals and the maximum tolerated dose. Usually two species, two routes, single dose.

Subacute toxicity
Three doses, two species. 4 weeks to 3 months may be necessary prior to clinical trial. The longer the duration of expected clinical use, the longer the subacute test.

Chronic toxicity
Rodent and non-rodent species. 6 months or longer. Required when drug is intended to be used in humans for prolonged periods. Usually run concurrently with clinical trial.

Effect on reproductive performance
Effects on animal mating behavior, reproduction, parturition, progeny, birth defects, postnatal development.

Carcinogenic potential
Two years, two species. Required when drug is intended to be used in humans for prolonged periods.
Mutagenic potential
Effects on genetic stability and mutations in bacteria (Ames test) or mammalian cells in culture; dominant lethal test and clastogenicity in mice.

Investigative toxicology
Determine sequence and mechanisms of toxic action. Discover the genes, proteins, pathways involved. Develop new methods for assessing toxicity.

The goals of preclinical toxicity studies include identifying potential human toxicities; designing tests to
further define the toxic mechanisms; and predicting the specific and the most relevant toxicities to be monitored in clinical trials. In addition to the studies shown in Tables 5-1 and 5-2, several quantitative estimates are desirable. These include the "no-effect" dose - the maximum dose at which a specified toxic effect is not seen; the minimum lethal dose - the smallest dose that is observed to kill any experimental animal; and, if necessary, the median lethal dose ( $\mathbf{L} \mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{5 0}}$ ) - the dose that kills approximately $50 \%$ of the animals. Presently, the $\mathrm{LD}_{50}$ is estimated from the smallest number of animals possible. These doses are used to calculate the initial dose to be tried in humans, usually taken as one hundredth to one tenth of the no-effect dose in animals.

It is important to recognize the limitations of preclinical testing. These include the following:
1. Toxicity testing is time-consuming and expensive. Two to 6 years may be required to collect and analyze data on toxicity and estimates of therapeutic index (a comparison of the amount that causes the desired therapeutic effect to the amount that causes toxic effects, see Chapter 2) before the drug can be considered ready for testing in humans.
2. Large numbers of animals may be needed to obtain valid preclinical data. Scientists are properly concerned about this situation, and progress has been made toward reducing the numbers required while still obtaining valid data. Cell and tissue culture in vitro methods are increasingly being used, but their predictive value is still severely limited. Nevertheless, some segments of the public attempt to halt all animal testing in the unfounded belief that it has become unnecessary.
3. Extrapolations of therapeutic index and toxicity data from animals to humans are reasonably predictive for many but not for all toxicities. Seeking an improved process, a Predictive Safety Testing Consortium of five of America's largest pharmaceutical companies with an advisory role by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been formed to share internally developed laboratory methods to predict the safety of new treatments before they are tested in humans.
4. For statistical reasons, rare adverse effects are unlikely to be detected.

\section*{EVALUATION IN HUMANS}

Less than one third of the drugs tested in clinical trials reach the marketplace. Federal law in the USA and ethical considerations require that the study of new drugs in humans be conducted in accordance with stringent guidelines. Scientifically valid results are not guaranteed simply by conforming to government regulations, however, and the design and execution of a good clinical trial require interdisciplinary personnel including basic scientists, clinical pharmacologists, clinician specialists, statisticians, and frequently others. The need for careful design and execution is based on three major confounding factors inherent in the study of any drug in humans.

\section*{Confounding Factors in Clinical Trials}

\section*{THE VARIABLE NATURAL HISTORY OF MOST DISEASES}

Many diseases tend to wax and wane in severity; some disappear spontaneously, even, on occasion, malignant neoplasms. A good experimental design takes into account the natural history of the disease by evaluating a large enough population of subjects over a sufficient period of time. Further protection against errors of interpretation caused by disease fluctuations is provided by using a crossover design, which consists of alternating periods of administration of test drug, placebo preparation (the control), and the standard treatment (positive control), if any, in each subject. These sequences are systematically varied, so that different subsets of patients receive each of the possible sequences of treatment.

\section*{THE PRESENCE OF OTHER DISEASES AND RISK FACTORS}

Known and unknown diseases and risk factors (including lifestyles of subjects) may influence the results of a clinical study. For example, some diseases alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs (see Chapters 3 and 4). Concentrations of a blood or tissue component being monitored as a measure of the effect of the new agent may be influenced by other diseases or other drugs. Attempts to avoid this hazard usually involve the crossover technique (when feasible) and proper selection and assignment of patients to each of the study groups. This requires obtaining accurate medical and pharmacologic histories (including use of recreational drugs) and the use of statistically valid methods of randomization in assigning subjects to particular study groups.

\section*{SUBJ ECT AND OBSERVER BIAS}

Most patients tend to respond in a positive way to any therapeutic intervention by interested, caring, and enthusiastic medical personnel. The manifestation of this phenomenon in the subject is the placebo response (Latin, "I shall please") and may involve objective physiologic and biochemical changes as well as changes in subjective complaints associated with the disease. The placebo response is usually quantitated by administration of an inert material, with exactly the same physical appearance, odor, consistency, etc, as the active dosage form. The magnitude of the response varies considerably from patient to patient and may also be influenced by the duration of the study. Placebo adverse effects and "toxicity" also occur but usually involve subjective effects: stomach upset, insomnia, sedation, etc.

Subject bias effects can be quantitated-and minimized relative to the response measured during active therapy-by the single-blind design. This involves use of a placebo as described above, administered to the same subjects in a crossover design, if possible, or to a separate control group of subjects. Observer bias can be taken into account by disguising the identity of the medication being used-placebo or active form-from both the subjects and the personnel evaluating the subjects' responses (double-blind design). In this design, a third party holds the code identifying each medication packet, and the code is not broken until all of the clinical data have been collected.

\section*{The Food \& Drug Administration (FDA)}

It is the responsibility of those seeking to market a drug to test it and submit evidence on its relative safety and effectiveness. The FDA is the administrative body that oversees the drug evaluation process in the USA and grants approval for marketing of new drug products.
Outside the USA, the regulatory and drug approval for marketing process is generally similar to that in the USA. For example, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products (EMEA) is responsible for biologicals and optional for synthetic drugs. In Japan, the marketing and manufacture of drugs is regulated by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) and advised by the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council (CPAC), which evaluates scientific data.

The FDA's authority to regulate drugs derives from specific legislation (Table 5-3). If a drug has not been shown through adequately controlled testing to be "safe and effective" for a specific use, it cannot be marketed in interstate commerce for this use.*

Unfortunately, "safe" can mean different things to the patient, the physician, and society. As noted above, complete absence of risk is impossible to demonstrate, but this fact is not well understood by the average member of the public, who frequently assume that any medication sold with the approval of the FDA should indeed be free of serious "side effects." This confusion is a major factor in litigation and dissatisfaction with aspects of drugs and medical care.

The history of drug regulation reflects several medical and public health events that precipitated major shifts in public opinion. The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 (Table 5-3) became law mostly in response to revelations of unsanitary and unethical practices in the meat-packing industry. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 was largely a reaction to deaths associated with the use of a preparation of sulfanilamide marketed before it and its vehicle were adequately tested. Thalidomide is another example of a drug that altered drug testing methods and stimulated drug regulating legislation. This agent was introduced in Europe in 1957-1958 and, based on animal tests then commonly used, was marketed as a "nontoxic" hypnotic and for morning sickness treatment during pregnancy. In 1961, reports were published suggesting that thalidomide was responsible for a dramatic increase in the incidence of a rare birth defect called phocomelia, a condition involving shortening or complete absence of the limbs. Epidemiologic studies provided strong evidence for the association of this defect with thalidomide use by women during the first trimester of pregnancy, and the drug was withdrawn from sale worldwide. An estimated 10,000 children were born with birth defects because of maternal exposure to this one agent. The tragedy led to the requirement for more extensive testing of new drugs for teratogenic effects and played an important role in stimulating passage of the Kefauver-Harris Amendments of 1962, even though the drug was not then approved for use in the USA. In spite of its disastrous fetal toxicity and effects in pregnancy, thalidomide is a relatively safe drug for humans other than the fetus. Even the most serious risk of toxicities may be avoided or managed if understood, and despite its toxicity thalidomide is now allowed by the FDA for limited use as a potent immunoregulatory agent and to treat certain forms of leprosy.

It is impossible to certify that a drug is absolutely safe, ie, free of all risk. It is possible, however, to identify most of the hazards likely to be associated with use of a new drug and to place some statistical limits on frequency of occurrence of such events in the population under study. As a result, an operational and pragmatic definition of "safety" can usually be reached that is based on the nature and incidence of drugassociated hazards compared with the hazard of nontherapy of the target disease.
*Although the FDA does not directly control drug commerce within states, a variety of state and federal laws control interstate production and marketing of drugs.

\section*{Clinical Trials: The IND \& NDA}

Once a drug is judged ready to be studied in humans, a Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption
for a New Drug (IND) must be filed with the FDA (Figure 5-1). The IND includes (1) information on the composition and source of the drug, (2) chemical and manufacturing information, (3) all data from animal studies, (4) proposed clinical plans and protocols, (5) the names and credentials of physicians who will conduct the clinical trials, and (6) a compilation of the key data relevant to study the drug in man made available to investigators and their institutional review boards.

It often requires 4-6 years of clinical testing to accumulate and analyze all required data. Testing in humans is begun after sufficient acute and subacute animal toxicity studies have been completed. Chronic safety testing in animals, including carcinogenicity studies, is usually done concurrently with clinical trials. In each of the three formal phases of clinical trials, volunteers or patients must be informed of the investigational status of the drug as well as the possible risks and must be allowed to decline or to consent to participate and receive the drug. These regulations are based on the ethical principles set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki. In addition to the approval of the sponsoring organization and the FDA, an interdisciplinary institutional review board (IRB) at the facility where the clinical drug trial will be conducted must review and approve the plans and ethics for testing in humans.

In phase 1, the effects of the drug as a function of dosage are established in a small number (25-50) of healthy volunteers. Although a goal is to find the maximum tolerated dose, the study is designed to avoid severe toxicity. If the drug is expected to have significant toxicity, as is often the case in cancer and AIDS therapy, volunteer patients with the disease are used in phase 1 rather than normal volunteers. Phase 1 trials are done to determine whether humans and animals show significantly different responses to the drug and to establish the probable limits of the safe clinical dosage range. These trials are nonblind or "open"; that is, both the investigators and the subjects know what is being given. Many predictable toxicities are detected in this phase. Pharmacokinetic measurements of absorption, half-life, and metabolism are often done in phase 1. Phase 1 studies are usually performed in research centers by specially trained clinical pharmacologists.

In phase 2, the drug is studied in patients with the target disease to determine its efficacy. A modest number of patients (100-200) are studied in detail. A single-blind design is often used, with an inert placebo medication and an established active drug (positive control) in addition to the investigational agent. Phase 2 trials are usually done in special clinical centers (eg, university hospitals). A broader range of toxicities may be detected in this phase.

In phase 3, the drug is evaluated in much larger numbers of patients with the target disease-sometimes thousands—to further establish safety and efficacy. Using information gathered in phases 1 and 2, phase 3 trials are designed to minimize errors caused by placebo effects, variable course of the disease, etc. Therefore, double-blind and crossover techniques are frequently used. Phase 3 trials are usually performed in settings similar to those anticipated for the ultimate use of the drug. Phase 3 studies can be difficult to design and execute and are usually expensive because of the large numbers of patients involved and the masses of data that must be collected and analyzed. The investigators are usually specialists in the disease being treated. Certain toxic effects, especially those caused by immunologic processes, may first become apparent in phase 3.

If phase 3 results meet expectations, application is made for permission to market the new agent. Marketing approval requires submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA. The application contains, often in hundreds of volumes, full reports of all preclinical and clinical data pertaining to the drug
under review. The number of subjects studied in support of the NDA has been increasing and currently averages more than 5000 patients for new drugs of novel structure (new molecular entities). The duration of the FDA review leading to approval (or denial) of the NDA may vary from months to years. Priority approvals are designated for products that represent significant improvements compared with marketed products; in 2004, the median priority approval time was 6 months. Standard approvals, which take longer, are designated for products judged similar to those on the market-in 2004, the median standard approval time was 12.9 months. In cases in which an urgent need is perceived (eg, cancer chemotherapy), the process of preclinical and clinical testing and FDA review may be accelerated. For serious diseases, the FDA may permit extensive but controlled marketing of a new drug before phase 3 studies are completed; for life-threatening diseases, it may permit controlled marketing even before phase 2 studies have been completed.

Once approval to market a drug has been obtained, phase 4 begins. This constitutes monitoring the safety of the new drug under actual conditions of use in large numbers of patients. The importance of careful and complete reporting of toxicity by physicians after marketing begins can be appreciated by noting that many important drug-induced effects have an incidence of 1 in 10,000 or less and that some side effects may become more apparent after chronic dosing. The sample size required to disclose drug-induced events or toxicities is very large for such rare events. For example, several hundred thousand patients may have to be exposed before the first case is observed of a toxicity that occurs with an average incidence of 1 in 10,000 (see Case Study: Aspirin to COX-2 Inhibitors-From Discovery to Recall). Therefore, low-incidence drug effects are not generally detected before phase 4 no matter how carefully the studies are executed. Phase 4 has no fixed duration.

The time from the filing of a patent application to approval for marketing of a new drug may be 5 years or considerably longer. Since the lifetime of a patent is 20 years in the USA, the owner of the patent (usually a pharmaceutical company) has exclusive rights for marketing the product for only a limited time after approval of the NDA. Because the FDA review process can be lengthy, the time consumed by the review is sometimes added to the patent life. However, the extension (up to 5 years) cannot increase the total life of the patent to more than 14 years after NDA approval. After expiration of the patent, any company may produce the drug, file an ANDA (abbreviated NDA), demonstrate required equivalence, and, with FDA approval, market the drug as a generic product without paying license fees to the original patent owner. However, a trademark (the drug's proprietary trade name) may be legally protected indefinitely. Therefore, pharmaceutical companies are motivated to give their new drugs easily remembered trade names. Generic prescribing is described in Chapter 66.

The FDA drug approval process is one of the rate-limiting factors in the time it takes for a drug to be marketed and to reach patients. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of 1992, reauthorized in 1997 and 2002, attempts to make more FDA resources available to the drug approval process and increase efficiency through use of fees collected from the drug companies that produce certain human drugs and biologic products. Current PDUFA fees for a new chemical entity are about $\$ 1$ million.

\section*{CASE STUDY: ASPIRIN TO COX-2 INHIBITORS-FROM DISCOVERY TO RECALL*}

The idea. The pain-relieving and fever-reducing effects of willow bark and its extracts have been known for millennia; its main active component, salicin, was identified in 1828. The synthesis of the salicin derivative, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) in 1897 and recognition of its anti-inflammatory effect constituted a landmark event. Determining how aspirin worked and might be improved would take another 70 years.

The clinical need. Aspirin has broad therapeutic actions. However, it also has significant adverse effects including stomach pain and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Corticosteroids are too toxic for chronic use. The need and opportunity for improved nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) became confluent with improved understanding of mediators of inflammation, especially prostaglandins (PGs) as drug targets. From the 1950s through the 1980s, many NSAIDs were developed that were more potent than aspirin but had similar toxicities, especially GI adverse effects.

The biologic hypothesis. Vane and his colleagues demonstrated that aspirin had a key role in inhibiting PG synthesis. Needleman and others found that the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) involved in the synthesis of specific PGs was increased in inflamed tissue and stimulated by certain cytokines. Needleman provided evidence for an inducible COX (COX-2) that is up-regulated in inflammation, which could be differentiated from the other, constitutive, isoform (COX-1) that maintains the integrity of the lining of the stomach. COX-1 also helps maintain normal platelet and kidney functions. Could COX-2 be a new drug target?

The chemical hypothesis. In 1991, scientists cloned and expressed COX-2. Using both screening and rational drug design, an inhibitor much more selective for COX-2 than for COX-1 was discovered and named celecoxib (Celebrex). Soon thereafter, the COX-2-selective drug rofecoxib (Vioxx) was discovered, followed by a third valdecoxib (Bextra).

Development. Celecoxib was approved in December 1998 for treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

The NDA for rofecoxib was filed in 1998. At about the same time, its manufacturer began two large clinical trials with rofecoxib in an attempt to discover whether the drug also protected against colonic polyps and against Alzheimer's disease. In 1999, the FDA approved the rofecoxib NDA for the relief of osteoarthritis symptoms, management of acute pain, and painful menstruation. About 1 year later, the results of the first large comparison trial became available. These showed the benefits of rofecoxib in protecting the stomach, but also showed a fourfold higher risk of heart attacks compared with a nonselective COX inhibitor. In 2002, the FDA approved changes to the rofecoxib label, including noting cardiovascular risks, GI benefits, and a new use to treat rheumatoid arthritis. In 2004, the second large trial showed twice the risk of heart attacks among patients taking rofecoxib for 18 months compared with those who took placebos. The manufacturer then decided to voluntarily withdraw rofecoxib, ceasing marketing and sales.

Postscript. The discovery, development, and marketing of celecoxib and the recall of rofecoxib (and subsequently valdecoxib) are representative of the opportunities, mistakes, and issues facing health care companies and practitioners. However, it is clear that vigorous phase 4 and follow-up drug surveillance efforts are now an increasingly important aspect of the drug R\&D process.

\section*{Orphan Drugs \& Treatment of Rare Diseases}

Drugs for rare diseases-so-called orphan drugs-can be difficult to research, develop, and market. Proof of drug safety and efficacy in small populations must be established, but doing so is a complex process. For example, for ethical and legal reasons, clinical testing of drugs in children is severely restricted, but a number of rare diseases affect the very young. Furthermore, because basic research in the pathophysiology
and mechanisms of rare diseases receives relatively little attention or funding in both academic and industrial settings, recognized rational targets for drug action may be few. In addition, the cost of developing a drug can greatly influence priorities when the target population is relatively small.

The Orphan Drug Act of 1983, which amended the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, provides incentives for the development of drugs for treatment of a rare disease or condition defined as "any disease or condition which (a) affects less than 200,000 persons in the U.S. or (b) affects more than 200,000 persons in the U.S. but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. of such drug." Since 1983, the FDA has approved for marketing 268 orphan drugs to treat more than 82 rare diseases.

\section*{Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs)}

An adverse reaction to a drug is a harmful or unintended response. ADRs are claimed to be the 4th leading cause of death, exceeding pulmonary disease, AIDS, accidents, and automobile deaths. The FDA has further estimated that 300,000 preventable adverse events occur in hospitals, many as a result of confusing medical information. Some adverse reactions, such as overdose, excessive effects, and drug interactions, may occur in anyone. Adverse reactions occurring only in susceptible patients include intolerance, idiosyncrasy (frequently genetic in origin), and allergy (usually immunologically mediated). During the IND and clinical phase 1-3 trials and before FDA approval, all adverse events (serious, lifethreatening, disabling, reasonably drug-related, or unexpected) must be reported. Following FDA approval to market, surveillance, evaluation, and reporting must continue for any adverse events in patients that are related to use of the drug, including overdose, accident, failure of expected action, events occurring from drug withdrawal, and unexpected events not listed in labeling. Events that are both serious and unexpected must be reported to the FDA within 15 days. In January 2006, the FDA announced a new prescription drug information format to improve patient safety by implementing improvements in prescription drug labels and inserts so they are less confusing and more concise with respect to prescribing information aiding both patients and health care professionals.

\section*{I NTRODUCTION TO AUTONOMI C PHARMACOLOGY: I NTRODUCTI ON}

The motor (efferent) portion of the nervous system can be divided into two major subdivisions: autonomic anc somatic. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is largely autonomous (independent) in that its activities are not under direct conscious control. It is concerned primarily with visceral functions such as cardiac output, blood flow to various organs, and digestion, which are necessary for life. The somatic division is largely concerned with consciously controlled functions such as movement, respiration, and posture. Both systems have important afferent (sensory) inputs that provide information regarding the internal and external environments and modify motor output through reflex arcs of varying size and complexity.

The nervous system has several properties in common with the endocrine system, which is the other major system for control of body function. These include high-level integration in the brain, the ability to influence processes in distant regions of the body, and extensive use of negative feedback. Both systems use chemicals for the transmission of information. In the nervous system, chemical transmission occurs between nerve cells and their effector cells. Chemical transmission takes place through the release of small amounts of transmitter substances from the nerve terminals into the synaptic cleft. The transmitter crosses the cleft by diffusion and activates or inhibits the postsynaptic cell by binding to a specialized receptor molecule.

By using drugs that mimic or block the actions of chemical transmitters, we can selectively modify many autonomic functions. These functions involve a variety of effector tissues, including cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, vascular endothelium, exocrine glands, and presynaptic nerve terminals. Autonomic drugs are useful in many clinical conditions. However, a very large number of drugs used for other purposes have unwanted effect: on autonomic function.

\section*{ANATOMY OF THE AUTONOMI C NERVOUS SYSTEM}

The autonomic nervous system lends itself to division on anatomic grounds into two major portions: the sympathetic (thoracolumbar) division and the parasympathetic (craniosacral) division (Figure 6-1). Botl divisions originate in nuclei within the central nervous system and give rise to preganglionic efferent fibers that exit from the brain stem or spinal cord and terminate in motor ganglia. The sympathetic preganglionic fibers leave the central nervous system through the thoracic and lumbar spinal nerves. The parasympathetic preganglionic fibers leave the central nervous system through the cranial nerves (especially the third, seventh, ninth, and tenth) and the third and fourth sacral spinal roots.

Schematic diagram comparing some anatomic and neurotransmitter features of autonomic and somatic motor nerves. Only the primary transmitter substances are shown. Parasympathetic ganglia are not shown because most are in or near the wall of the organ innervated. Cholinergic nerves are shown in color. Note that some sympathetic postganglionic fibers release acetylcholine or dopamine rather than norepinephrine. The adrenal medulla, a modified sympathetic ganglion, receives sympathetic preganglionic fibers and releases epinephrine and norepinephrine into the blood. (ACh, acetylcholine; D, dopamine; Epi, epinephrine; NE, norepinephrine; N, nicotinic receptors; M, muscarinic receptors.)

Most of the sympathetic preganglionic fibers terminate in ganglia located in the paravertebral chains that lie on either side of the spinal column. The remaining sympathetic preganglionic fibers terminate in prevertebral ganglia, which lie in front of the vertebrae, usually on the surface of the aorta. From the ganglia, postganglionic sympathetic fibers run to the tissues innervated. Some preganglionic parasympathetic fibers terminate in parasympathetic ganglia located outside the organs innervated: the ciliary, pterygopalatine, submandibular, otic, and several pelvic ganglia. The majority of parasympathetic preganglionic fibers terminate on ganglion cells distributed diffusely or in networks in the walls of the innervated organs. Note that the terms "sympathetic" and "parasympathetic" are anatomic designations and do not depend on the type of transmitter chemical released from the nerve endings nor on the kind of effect-excitatory or inhibitory-evoked by nerve activity.

In addition to these clearly defined peripheral motor portions of the ANS, large numbers of afferent fibers run from the periphery to integrating centers, including the enteric plexuses in the gut, the autonomic ganglia, and the central nervous system. Many of the sensory neurons that end in the central nervous system terminate in
the integrating centers of the hypothalamus and medulla and evoke reflex motor activity that is carried to the effector cells by the efferent fibers described above. There is increasing evidence that some of these sensory fibers also have peripheral motor functions (see Nonadrenergic, Noncholinergic Neurons, below).

The enteric nervous system (ENS) is a large and highly organized collection of neurons located in the walls of the gastrointestinal system (Figure 6-2). It is sometimes considered a third division of the ANS. The ENS includes the myenteric plexus (the plexus of Auerbach) and the submucous plexus (the plexus of Meissner). These neuronal networks receive preganglionic fibers from the parasympathetic system and postganglionic sympathetic axons. They also receive sensory input from within the wall of the gut. Fibers from the cell bodies in these plexuses travel to the smooth muscle of the gut to control motility and to secretory cells in the mucosa Sensory fibers transmit information from the mucosa and from stretch receptors to motor neurons in the plexuses and to postganglionic neurons in the sympathetic ganglia. The parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers that synapse on enteric plexus neurons appear to play a modulatory role, as indicated by the observation that deprivation of input from both ANS divisions does not completely halt activity in the plexuses nor in the smooth muscle and glands innervated by them.
Figure 6-2.

A highly simplified diagram of the intestinal wall and some of the circuitry of the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS receives input from both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic systems and sends afferent impulses to sympathetic ganglia and to the central nervous system. Many transmitter or neuromodulator substances have been identified in the ENS; see Table 6-1. (LM, longitudinal muscle layer; MP, myenteric plexus; CM, circular muscle layer; SMP, submucosal plexus; ACh, acetylcholine; NE, norepinephrine; NO, nitric oxide; NP, neuropeptides; SP, substance P; 5-HT, serotonin.)

\section*{NEUROTRANSMI TTER CHEMI STRY OF THE AUTONOMI C NERVOUS SYSTEM}

An important traditional classification of autonomic nerves is based on the primary transmitter molecules-acetylcholine or norepinephrine-released from their terminal boutons and varicosities. A large number of peripheral ANS fibers synthesize and release acetylcholine; they are cholinergic fibers, ie, they act by releasing acetylcholine. As shown in Figure 6-1, these include all preganglionic efferent autonomic fibers anc the somatic (nonautonomic) motor fibers to skeletal muscle as well. Thus, almost all efferent fibers leaving the central nervous system are cholinergic. In addition, most parasympathetic postganglionic and a few sympathetic postganglionic fibers are cholinergic. A significant number of parasympathetic postganglionic neurons utilize nitric oxide or peptides for transmission. Most postganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline); they are noradrenergic (often called simply "adrenergic") fibers; that is, they act by releasing norepinephrine. These transmitter characteristics are presented schematically in Figure 6-1. As noted above, a few sympathetic fibers release acetylcholine. Dopamine is a vers important transmitter in the central nervous system, and there is evidence that it may be released by some peripheral sympathetic fibers. Adrenal medullary cells, which are embryologically analogous to postganglionic sympathetic neurons, release a mixture of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Finally, most autonomic nerves alsc release several transmitter substances, or cotransmitters, in addition to the primary transmitters described above.

Five key features of neurotransmitter function provide potential targets for pharmacologic therapy: synthesis, storage, release, and termination of action of the transmitter, and functions of the receptor. These processes are discussed in detail below.

\section*{Cholinergic Transmission}

The terminals of cholinergic neurons contain large numbers of small membrane-bound vesicles concentrated near the synaptic portion of the cell membrane (Figure 6-3) as well as a smaller number of large dense-cored vesicles located farther from the synaptic membrane. The large vesicles contain a high concentration of peptide cotransmitters (Table 6-1), whereas the smaller clear vesicles contain most of the acetylcholine. Vesicles are initially synthesized in the neuron soma and transported to the terminal. They may also be recycled several times within the terminal. Vesicles are provided with vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMPs), which serve to align them with release sites on the inner neuronal cell membrane and participate in triggering the release of transmitter. The corresponding release site on the inner surface of the nerve terminal membrane contains synaptosomal nerve-associated proteins (SNAPs).

Schematic illustration of a generalized cholinergic junction (not to scale). Choline is transported into the presynaptic nerve terminal by a sodium-dependent choline transporter (CHT). This transporter can be inhibited by hemicholinium drugs. In the cytoplasm, acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and acetyl Co-A (AcCoA) by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). ACh is then transported into the storage vesicle by a second carrier, the vesicle-associated transporter (VAT), which can be inhibited by vesamicol. Peptides (P), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and proteoglycan are also stored in the vesicle. Release of transmitter occurs when voltage-sensitive calcium channels in the terminal membrane are opened, allowing an influx of calcium. The resulting increase in intracellular calcium causes fusion of vesicles with the surface membrane and exocytotic expulsion of ACh and cotransmitters into the junctional cleft (see text). This step can be blocked by botulinum toxin. Acetylcholine's action is terminated by metabolism by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Receptors on the presynaptic nerve ending regulate transmitter release. (SNAPs, synaptosome-associated proteins; VAMPs, vesicle-associated membrane proteins.)

\section*{Substance}

\section*{Probable Roles}

Acetylcholine (ACh)
The primary transmitter at ANS ganglia, at the somatic neuromuscular junction, and at parasympathetic postganglionic nerve endings. A primary excitatory transmitter to smooth muscle and secretory cells in the ENS Probably also the major neuron-to-neuron ("ganglionic") transmitter in the ENS.

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
Acts as a transmitter or cotransmitter at many ANS-effector synapses.
Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)
Found with substance P in cardiovascular sensory nerve fibers. Present in some secretomotor ENS neurons and interneurons. A cardiac stimulant.

Cholecystokinin (CCK)
May act as a cotransmitter in some excitatory neuromuscular ENS neurons.
Dopamine
A modulatory transmitter in some ganglia and the ENS. Probably a postganglionic sympathetic transmitter in renal blood vessels.

Enkephalin and related opioid peptides
Present in some secretomotor and interneurons in the ENS. Appear to inhibit ACh release and thereby inhibit peristalsis. May stimulate secretion.

Galanin
Present in secretomotor neurons; may play a role in appetite-satiety mechanisms.
GABA ( $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid)
May have presynaptic effects on excitatory ENS nerve terminals. Has some relaxant effect on the gut. Probably not a major transmitter in the ENS.

Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)
Extremely potent excitatory transmitter to gastrin cells. Also known as mammalian bombesin.
Neuropeptide Y (NPY)
Found in many noradrenergic neurons. Present in some secretomotor neurons in the ENS and may inhibit secretion of water and electrolytes by the gut. Causes long-lasting vasoconstriction. It is also a cotransmitter in some parasympathetic postganglionic neurons.

Nitric oxide (NO)
A cotransmitter at inhibitory ENS neuromuscular junctions; may be especially important at sphincters.
Norepinephrine (NE)
The primary transmitter at most sympathetic postganglionic nerve endings.
Serotonin (5-HT)
An important transmitter or cotransmitter at excitatory neuron-to-neuron junctions in the ENS.
Substance P (and related "tachykinins")
Substance P is an important sensory neuron transmitter in the ENS and elsewhere. Tachykinins appear to be excitatory cotransmitters with ACh at ENS neuromuscular junctions. Found with CGRP in cardiovascular sensory neurons. Substance P is a vasodilator (probably via release of nitric oxide).

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)
Excitatory secretomotor transmitter in the ENS; may also be an inhibitory ENS neuromuscular cotransmitter. A probable cotransmitter in many cholinergic neurons. A vasodilator (found in many perivascular neurons) and cardiac stimulant.
${ }^{1}$ See Chapter 21 for transmitters found in the central nervous system.
Acetylcholine is synthesized in the cytoplasm from acetyl-CoA and choline through the catalytic action of the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Acetyl-CoA is synthesized in mitochondria, which are present in large numbers in the nerve ending. Choline is transported from the extracellular fluid into the neuron terminal by a sodium-dependent membrane choline transporter (Figure 6-3, CHT ). This symporter can be blocked by a group of research drugs called hemicholiniums. Once synthesized, acetylcholine is transported from the cytoplasm into the vesicles by a vesicle-associated transporter that is driven by proton efflux (Figure 6-3, carrier VAT ). This antiporter can be blocked by the research drug vesamicol. Acetylcholine synthesis is a rapid process capable of supporting a very high rate of transmitter release. Storage of acetylcholine is accomplished by the packaging of "quanta" of acetylcholine molecules (usually 1000-50,000 molecules in each vesicle).

Vesicles are concentrated on the inner surface of the nerve terminal facing the synapse through the interaction of so-called SNARE proteins on the vesicle (VAMPs called v-SNAREs, especially synaptobrevin) and on the inside of the neuronal cell membrane (SNAPs called t-SNAREs, especially syntaxin and SNAP-25). Release of transmitter from the vesicles is dependent on extracellular calcium and occurs when an action potential reaches the terminal and triggers sufficient influx of calcium ions. Calcium interacts with the VAMP synaptotagmin on
the vesicle membrane and triggers fusion of the vesicle membrane with the terminal membrane and opening of a pore into the synapse. The opening of the pore results in exocytotic expulsion-in the case of somatic motor nerves—of several hundred quanta of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. The amount of transmitter released by one depolarization of an autonomic postganglionic nerve terminal is probably smaller. In addition to acetylcholine, several cotransmitters are released at the same time (Table 6-1). The acetylcholine vesicle release process is blocked by botulinum toxin through the enzymatic removal of two amino acids from one or more of the fusion proteins.

After release from the presynaptic terminal, acetylcholine molecules may bind to and activate an acetylcholine receptor (cholinoceptor). Eventually (and usually very rapidly), all of the acetylcholine released diffuses withir range of an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) molecule. AChE very efficiently splits acetylcholine into choline and acetate, neither of which has significant transmitter effect, and thereby terminates the action of the transmitter (Figure 6-3). Most cholinergic synapses are richly supplied with acetylcholinesterase; the half-life of acetylcholine in the synapse is therefore very short (seconds). Acetylcholinesterase is also found in other tissues, eg, red blood cells. (Another cholinesterase with a lower specificity for acetylcholine, butyrylcholinesterase [pseudocholinesterase], is found in blood plasma, liver, glia, and many other tissues.)

\section*{Adrenergic Transmission}

Adrenergic neurons (Figure 6-4) also transport a precursor molecule into the nerve ending, then synthesize the catecholamine transmitter, and finally store it in membrane-bound vesicles, but, as indicated in Figure 6-5, the synthesis of the catecholamine transmitters is more complex than that of acetylcholine. In most sympathetic postganglionic neurons, norepinephrine is the final product. In the adrenal medulla and certain areas of the brain, norepinephrine is further converted to epinephrine. In dopaminergic neurons, synthesis terminates with dopamine. Several processes in these nerve terminals are potential sites of drug action. One of these, the conversion of tyrosine to dopa, is the rate-limiting step in catecholamine transmitter synthesis. It can be inhibited by the tyrosine analog metyrosine (Figure 6-4). A high-affinity carrier for catecholamines located in the wall of the storage vesicle (vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT) can be inhibited by the reserpinı alkaloids (Figure 6-4, carrier VMAT). Reserpine causes depletion of transmitter stores. Another transporter (norepinephrine transporter, NET) carries norepinephrine and similar molecules back into the cell cytoplasn from the synaptic cleft (Figure 6-4, NET). NET is also commonly called uptake 1 or reuptake 1 . NET can be inhibited by cocaine and tricyclic antidepressant drugs, resulting in an increase of transmitter activity in the synaptic cleft. Similar transporters (DAT, SERT) are responsible for the reuptake of dopamine and 5-HT (serotonin), respectively, into the neurons that release these transmitters.

ending or varicosity by a sodium-dependent carrier (A). Tyrosine is converted to dopamine (see Figure 6-5 for details), which is transported into the vesicle by the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT), which can be blocked by reserpine. The same carrier transports norepinephrine (NE) and several other amines into these granules. Dopamine is converted to NE in the vesicle by dopamine- $B$-hydroxylase. Physiologic release of transmitter occurs when an action potential opens voltagesensitive calcium channels and increases intracellular calcium. Fusion of vesicles with the surface membrane results in expulsion of norepinephrine, cotransmitters, and dopamine- B-hydroxylase. Release can be blocked by drugs such as guanethidine and bretylium. After release, norepinephrine diffuses out of the cleft or is transported into the cytoplasm of the terminal by the norepinephrine transporter (NET), which can be blocked by cocaine and tricyclic antidepressants, or into postjunctional or perijunctional cells. Regulatory receptors are present on the presynaptic terminal. (SNAPs, synaptosomeassociated proteins; VAMPs, vesicle-associated membrane proteins.)

Biosynthesis of catecholamines. The rate-limiting step, conversion of tyrosine to dopa, can be inhibited by metyrosine (cimethyltyrosine). The alternative pathways shown by the dashed arrows have not been found to be of physiologic significanc in humans. However, tyramine and octopamine may accumulate in patients treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. (Reproduced, with permission, from Greenspan FS, Gardner DG (editors): Basic and Clinical Endocrinology, 7th ed. McGrawHill, 2003.)

Release of the vesicular transmitter store from noradrenergic nerve endings is similar to the calcium-dependent process described above for cholinergic terminals. In addition to the primary transmitter (norepinephrine), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), dopamine-B-hydroxylase, and peptide cotransmitters are also released into the synaptic cleft. Indirectly acting and mixed sympathomimetics, eg, tyramine, amphetamines, and ephedrine are capable of releasing stored transmitter from noradrenergic nerve endings by a calcium-independent process. These drugs are poor agonists (some are inactive) at adrenoceptors, but they are excellent substrates for monoamine transporters. As a result, they are avidly taken up into noradrenergic nerve endings by NET. In the nerve ending, they are then transported by VMAT into the vesicles, displacing norepinephrine, which is subsequently expelled into the synaptic space by reverse transport via NET. Amphetamines also inhibit monoamine oxidase and have other effects that result in increased norepinephrine activity in the synapse. Theil action does not require vesicle exocytosis.

Norepinephrine and epinephrine can be metabolized by several enzymes, as shown in Figure 6-6. Because of the high activity of monoamine oxidase in the mitochondria of the nerve terminal, there is significant turnover of norepinephrine even in the resting terminal. Since the metabolic products are excreted in the urine, an estimate of catecholamine turnover can be obtained from laboratory analysis of total metabolites (sometimes referred to as "VMA and metanephrines") in a 24-hour urine sample. However, metabolism is not the primary mechanism for termination of action of norepinephrine physiologically released from noradrenergic nerves. Termination of noradrenergic transmission results from two processes, simple diffusion away from the receptor site (with eventual metabolism in the plasma or liver), and reuptake into the nerve terminal by NET (Figure 6-4) or into perisynaptic glia or other cells.

\section*{Cotransmitters in Cholinergic \& Adrenergic Nerves}

As previously noted, the vesicles of both cholinergic and adrenergic nerves contain other substances in addition to the primary transmitter. Some of the substances identified to date are listed in Table 6-1. Many of these
substances are also primary transmitters in the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic nerves described in the text that follows. Their roles in the function of nerves that release acetylcholine or norepinephrine are not yet fully understood. In some cases, they provide a faster or slower action to supplement or modulate the effects of the primary transmitter. They also participate in feedback inhibition of the same and nearby nerve terminals.

\section*{AUTONOMI C RECEPTORS}

Historically, structure-activity analyses, with careful comparisons of the potency of series of autonomic agonist and antagonist analogs, led to the definition of different autonomic receptor subtypes, including muscarinic and nicotinic cholinoceptors, and $\alpha, \beta$, and dopamine adrenoceptors (Table 6-2). Subsequently, binding of isotopelabeled ligands permitted the purification and characterization of several of the receptor molecules. Molecular biology now provides techniques for the discovery and expression of genes that code for related receptors within these groups (see Chapter 2).

The primary acetylcholine receptor subtypes were named after the alkaloids originally used in their identification: muscarine and nicotine. These nouns are readily converted into adjectives-thus, muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. In the case of receptors associated with noradrenergic nerves, the coining of simple adjectives from the names of the agonists (noradrenaline, phenylephrine, isoproterenol, etc) was not practicable. Therefore, the term adrenoceptor is widely used to describe receptors that respond to catecholamines such as norepinephrine. By analogy, the term cholinoceptor denotes receptors (both muscarinic and nicotinic) that respond to acetylcholine. In North America, receptors were colloquially named
after the nerves that usually innervate them; thus, adrenergic (or noradrenergic) receptors and cholinergic receptors. The general class of adrenoceptors can be further subdivided into a-adrenoceptor, $B$ adrenoceptor, and dopamine-receptor types on the basis of both agonist and antagonist selectivity and on genomic grounds. Development of more selective blocking drugs has led to the naming of subclasses within these major types; for example, within the $\alpha_{\text {-adver }}$-adrenoceptor class, $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$ receptors differ in both agonist and antagonist selectivity. Specific examples of such selective drugs are given in the chapters that follow.

\section*{NONADRENERGIC, NONCHOLI NERGIC (NANC) NEURONS}

It has been known for many years that autonomic effector tissues (eg, gut, airways, bladder) contain nerve fibers that do not show the histochemical characteristics of either cholinergic or adrenergic fibers. Both motor and sensory nonadrenergic, noncholinergic fibers are present. Although peptides are the most common transmitter substances found in these nerve endings, other substances, eg, nitric oxide synthase and purines, are also present in many nerve terminals (Table 6-1). Capsaicin, a neurotoxin derived from chili peppers, can cause the release of transmitter (especially substance P ) from such neurons and, if given in high doses, destruction of the neuron.

The enteric system in the gut wall (Figure 6-2) is the most extensively studied system containing nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neurons in addition to cholinergic and adrenergic fibers. In the small intestine, for example, these neurons contain one or more of the following: nitric oxide synthase, calcitonin gene-related peptide, cholecystokinin, dynorphin, enkephalins, gastrin-releasing peptide, 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), neuropeptide $Y$, somatostatin, substance $P$, and vasoactive intestinal peptide. Some neurons contain as many as five different transmitters. The ENS functions in a semiautonomous manner, utilizing input from the motor outflow of the ANS for modulation of gastrointestinal activity and sending sensory information back to the central nervous system. The ENS provides the necessary synchronization of impulses that, for example, ensure forward, not backward, propulsion of gut contents and relaxation of sphincters when the gut wall contracts.

The sensory fibers in the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic systems are probably better termed "sensory-efferent" or "sensory-local effector" fibers because, when activated by a sensory input, they are capable of releasing transmitter peptides from the sensory ending itself, from local axon branches, and from collaterals that terminate in the autonomic ganglia. These peptides are potent agonists at many autonomic effector tissues.

\section*{FUNCTI ONAL ORGANI ZATI ON OF AUTONOMI C ACTI VI TY}

A basic understanding of the interactions of autonomic nerves with each other and with their effector organs is essential for an appreciation of the actions of autonomic drugs, especially because of the significant reflex (compensatory) effects that may be evoked by these agents.

\section*{Central Integration}

At the highest level—midbrain and medulla-the two divisions of the ANS and the endocrine system are integrated with each other, with sensory input, and with information from higher central nervous system centers. These interactions are such that early investigators called the parasympathetic system a trophotropic one (ie, leading to growth) used to "rest and digest" and the sympathetic system an ergotropic one (ie, leading to energy expenditure), which is activated for "fight or flight." Although such terms offer little insight into the mechanisms involved, they do provide simple descriptions applicable to many of the actions of the systems (Table 6-3). For example, slowing of the heart and stimulation of digestive activity are typical energy-
conserving actions of the parasympathetic system. In contrast, cardiac stimulation, increased blood sugar, and cutaneous vasoconstriction are responses produced by sympathetic discharge that are suited to fighting or surviving attack.

At a more subtle level of interactions in the brain stem, medulla, and spinal cord, there are important
cooperative interactions between the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems. For some organs, sensory fibers associated with the parasympathetic system exert reflex control over motor outflow in the sympathetic system. Thus, the sensory carotid sinus baroreceptor fibers in the glossopharyngeal nerve have a major influence on sympathetic outflow from the vasomotor center. This example is described in greater detail below. Similarly, parasympathetic sensory fibers in the wall of the urinary bladder significantly influence sympathetic inhibitory outflow to that organ. Within the enteric nervous system, sensory fibers from the wall of the gut synapse on both preganglionic and postganglionic motor cells that control intestinal smooth muscle and secretory cells (Figure 6-2).

\section*{Integration of Cardiovascular Function}

Autonomic reflexes are particularly important in understanding cardiovascular responses to autonomic drugs. A: indicated in Figure 6-7, the primary controlled variable in cardiovascular function is mean arterial pressure. Changes in any variable contributing to mean arterial pressure (eg, a drug-induced increase in peripheral vascular resistance) evoke powerful homeostatic secondary responses that tend to compensate for the directl: evoked change. The homeostatic response may be sufficient to reduce the change in mean arterial pressure and to reverse the drug's effects on heart rate. A slow infusion of norepinephrine provides a useful example. This agent produces direct effects on both vascular and cardiac muscle. It is a powerful vasoconstrictor and, by increasing peripheral vascular resistance, increases mean arterial pressure. In the absence of reflex control-in a patient who has had a heart transplant, for example-the drug's effect on the heart is also stimulatory; that is, it increases heart rate and contractile force. However, in a subject with intact reflexes, the negative feedback baroreceptor response to increased mean arterial pressure causes decreased sympathetic outflow to the heart and a powerful increase in parasympathetic (vagus nerve) discharge at the cardiac pacemaker. As a result, the net effect of ordinary pressor doses of norepinephrine in a normal subject is to produce a marked increase in peripheral vascular resistance, an increase in mean arterial pressure, and a consistent slowing of heart rate. Bradycardia, the reflex compensatory response elicited by this agent, is the exact opposite of the drug's direct action; yet it is completely predictable if the integration of cardiovascular function by the ANS is understood.
Figure 6-7.

Autonomic and hormonal control of cardiovascular function. Note that two feedback loops are present: the autonomic nervous system loop and the hormonal loop. The sympathetic nervous system directly influences four major variables: peripheral vascular resistance, heart rate, force, and venous tone. It also directly modulates renin production (not shown). The parasympathetic nervous system directly influences heart rate. In addition to its role in stimulating aldosterone secretion, angiotensin II directly increases peripheral vascular resistance and facilitates sympathetic effects (not shown). Thi net feedback effect of each loop is to compensate for changes in arterial blood pressure. Thus, decreased blood pressure dut to blood loss would evoke increased sympathetic outflow and renin release. Conversely, elevated pressure due to the administration of a vasoconstrictor drug would cause reduced sympathetic outflow, reduced renin release, and increased parasympathetic (vagal) outflow.

\section*{Presynaptic Regulation}

The principle of negative feedback control is also found at the presynaptic level of autonomic function. Important presynaptic feedback inhibitory control mechanisms have been shown to exist at most nerve endings. A well-documented mechanism involves the $a_{2}$ receptor located on noradrenergic nerve terminals. Thi: receptor is activated by norepinephrine and similar molecules; activation diminishes further release of norepinephrine from these nerve endings (Table 6-4). Conversely, a presynaptic Breceptor appears to facilitate the release of norepinephrine from some adrenergic neurons. Presynaptic receptors that respond to the primar! transmitter substance released by the nerve ending are called autoreceptors. Autoreceptors are usually inhibitory, but many cholinergic fibers, especially somatic motor fibers, have excitatory nicotinic autoreceptors.

Control of transmitter release is not limited to modulation by the transmitter itself. Nerve terminals also carry regulatory receptors that respond to many other substances. Such heteroreceptors may be activated by substances released from other nerve terminals that synapse with the nerve ending. For example, some vagal fibers in the myocardium synapse on sympathetic noradrenergic nerve terminals and inhibit norepinephrine release. Alternatively, the ligands for these receptors may diffuse to the receptors from the blood or from nearby tissues. Some of the transmitters and receptors identified to date are listed in Table 6-4. Presynaptic regulation by a variety of endogenous chemicals probably occurs in all nerve fibers.

\section*{Postsynaptic Regulation}

Postsynaptic regulation can be considered from two perspectives: modulation by the history of activity at the primary receptor (which may up- or down-regulate receptor number or desensitize receptors; see Chapter 2) and modulation by other temporally associated events.

The first mechanism has been well documented in several receptor-effector systems. Up- and down-regulation are known to occur in response to decreased or increased activation, respectively, of the receptors. An extreme form of up-regulation occurs after denervation of some tissues, resulting in denervation supersensitivity of the tissue to activators of that receptor type. In skeletal muscle, for example, nicotinic receptors are normally restricted to the end plate regions underlying somatic motor nerve terminals. Surgical denervation results in marked proliferation of nicotinic cholinoceptors over all parts of the fiber, including areas not previously associated with any motor nerve junctions. A pharmacologic supersensitivity related to denervation supersensitivity occurs in autonomic effector tissues after administration of drugs that deplete transmitter stores and prevent activation of the postsynaptic receptors for a sufficient period of time. For example, prolonged administration of large doses of reserpine, a norepinephrine depleter, can cause increased sensitivity of the smooth muscle and cardiac muscle effector cells served by the depleted sympathetic fibers.

The second mechanism involves modulation of the primary transmitter-receptor event by events evoked by the same or other transmitters acting on different postsynaptic receptors. Ganglionic transmission is a good example of this phenomenon (Figure 6-8). The postganglionic cells are activated (depolarized) as a result of binding of an appropriate ligand to a neuronal nicotinic ( $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{N}}$ ) acetylcholine receptor. The resulting fast excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) evokes a propagated action potential if threshold is reached. This even is often followed by a small and slowly developing but longer-lasting hyperpolarizing afterpotential-a slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). The hyperpolarization involves opening of potassium channels by $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ cholinoceptors. The IPSP is followed by a small, slow excitatory postsynaptic potential caused by closure of potassium channels linked to $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ cholinoceptors. Finally, a late, very slow EPSP may be evoked by peptides released from other fibers. These slow potentials serve to modulate the responsiveness of the postsynaptic cell to subsequent primary excitatory presynaptic nerve activity. (See Chapter 21 for additional examples.)

\section*{PHARMACOLOGIC MODI FI CATI ON OF AUTONOMI C FUNCTI ON}

Because transmission involves different mechanisms in different segments of the ANS, some drugs produce highly specific effects, whereas others are much less selective in their actions. A summary of the steps in transmission of impulses, from the central nervous system to the autonomic effector cells, is presented in Table 6-5. Drugs that block action potential propagation (local anesthetics) are very nonselective in their action, sinct they act on a process that is common to all neurons. On the other hand, drugs that act on the biochemical processes involved in transmitter synthesis and storage are more selective, since the biochemistry of adrenergic transmission is very different from that of cholinergic transmission. Activation or blockade of effector cell receptors offers maximum flexibility and selectivity of effect: adrenoceptors are easily distinguished from cholinoceptors. Furthermore, individual subgroups can often be selectively activated or blocked within each major type. Some examples are given in Pharmacology of the Eye.

Pharmacology of the Eye

The eye is a good example of an organ with multiple autonomic nervous system (ANS) functions, controlled by several different autonomic receptors. As shown in Figure 6-9, the anterior chamber is the site of several tissues controlled by the ANS. These tissues include three different muscles (pupillary dilator and constrictor muscles in the iris and the ciliary muscle) and the secretory epithelium of the ciliary body.
Figure 6-9.

Structures of the anterior chamber of the eye. Tissues with significant autonomic functions and the associated ANS receptor: are shown in this schematic diagram. Aqueous humor is secreted by the epithelium of the ciliary body, flows into the space in front of the iris, through the trabecular meshwork, and exits via the canal of Schlemm (arrow). Blockade of the B adrenoceptors associated with the ciliary epithelium causes decreased secretion of aqueous. Blood vessels (not shown) in the sclera are also under autonomic control and influence aqueous drainage.

Parasympathetic nerve activity and muscarinic cholinomimetics mediate contraction of the circular pupillary constrictor muscle and of the ciliary muscle. Contraction of the pupillary constrictor muscle causes miosis, a reduction in pupil size. Miosis is usually present in patients exposed to large systemic or small topical doses of cholinomimetics, especially organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitors. Ciliary muscle contraction causes accommodation of focus for near vision. Marked contraction of the ciliary muscle, which often occurs with cholinesterase inhibitor intoxication, is called cyclospasm. Ciliary muscle contraction also puts tension on the
trabecular meshwork, opening its pores and facilitating outflow of the aqueous humor into the canal of Schlemm. Increased outflow reduces intraocular pressure, a very useful result in patients with glaucoma. All of these effects are prevented or reversed by muscarinic blocking drugs such as atropine.

Alpha adrenoceptors mediate contraction of the radially oriented pupillary dilator muscle fibers in the iris and result in mydriasis. This occurs during sympathetic discharge and when alpha agonist drugs such as phenylephrine are placed in the conjunctival sac. Beta-adrenoceptors on the ciliary epithelium facilitate the secretion of aqueous humor. Blocking these receptors (with B-blocking drugs) reduces the secretory activity and reduces intraocular pressure, providing another therapy for glaucoma.

Cholinoceptor stimulants are classified pharmacologically by their spectrum of action depending on the type of receptor-muscarinic or nicotinic—that is activated. They are also classified by their mechanism of action because some cholinomimetic drugs bind directly to (and activate) cholinoceptors while others act indirectly by inhibiting the hydrolysis of endogenous acetylcholine.

\section*{SPECTRUM OF ACTI ON OF CHOLI NOMI METIC DRUGS}

Early studies of the parasympathetic nervous system showed that the alkaloid muscarine mimicked the effects of parasympathetic nerve discharge, ie, the effects were parasympathomimetic. Application of muscarine to ganglia and to autonomic effector tissues (smooth muscle, heart, exocrine glands) showed that the parasympathomimetic action of the alkaloid occurred through an action on receptors at effector cells, not those in ganglia. The effects of acetylcholine itself and of other cholinomimetic drugs at autonomic neuroeffector junctions are called parasympathomimetic effects, and are mediated by muscarinic receptors. In contrast, low concentrations of the alkaloid nicotine stimulated autonomic ganglia and skeletal muscle neuromuscular junctions but not autonomic effector cells. The ganglion and skeletal muscle receptors were therefore labeled nicotinic. When acetylcholine was later identified as the physiologic transmitter at both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, both receptors were recognized as cholinoceptor subtypes.

Cholinoceptors are members of either G protein-linked (muscarinic) or ion channel (nicotinic) families on
the basis of their transmembrane signaling mechanisms. Muscarinic receptors contain seven transmembrane domains whose third cytoplasmic loop is coupled to G proteins that function as transducers (see Figure 2-11). These receptors regulate the production of intracellular second messengers and modulate certain ion channels via their G proteins. Agonist selectivity is determined by the subtypes of muscarinic receptors and G proteins that are present in a given cell (Table 7-1). Muscarinic receptors are located on plasma membranes of cells in the central nervous system, in organs innervated by parasympathetic nerves as well as on some tissues that are not innervated by these nerves, eg, endothelial cells (Table 7-1), and on those tissues innervated by postganglionic sympathetic cholinergic nerves.

Nicotinic receptors are part of a transmembrane polypeptide whose subunits form cation-selective ion
channels (see Figure 2-9). These receptors are located on plasma membranes of postganglionic cells in all autonomic ganglia, of muscles innervated by somatic motor fibers, and of some central nervous system neurons (see Figure 6-1).

Unselective cholinoceptor stimulants in sufficient dosage can produce very diffuse and marked alterations in organ system function because acetylcholine has multiple sites of action where it initiates both excitatory and inhibitory effects. Fortunately, drugs are available that have a degree of selectivity, so that desired effects can often be achieved while avoiding or minimizing adverse effects. Selectivity of action is based on several factors. Some drugs stimulate either muscarinic receptors or nicotinic receptors selectively. Some agents stimulate nicotinic receptors at neuromuscular junctions preferentially and have less effect on nicotinic receptors in ganglia. Organ selectivity can also be achieved by using appropriate routes of administration ("pharmacokinetic selectivity"). For example, muscarinic stimulants can be administered topically to the surface of the eye to modify ocular function while minimizing systemic effects.

\section*{MODE OF ACTION OF CHOLI NOMI METI C DRUGS}

Direct-acting cholinomimetic agents bind to and activate muscarinic or nicotinic receptors (Figure 7-1). Indirect-acting agents produce their primary effects by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, which hydrolyzes acetylcholine to choline and acetic acid (see Figure 6-3). By inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the indirectacting drugs increase the endogenous acetylcholine concentration in synaptic clefts and neuroeffector junctions. The excess acetylcholine, in turn, stimulates cholinoceptors to evoke increased responses. These drugs act primarily where acetylcholine is physiologically released and are thus amplifiers of endogenous acetylcholine.

Some cholinesterase inhibitors also inhibit butyrylcholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase). However, inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase plays little role in the action of indirect-acting cholinomimetic drugs because this enzyme is not important in the physiologic termination of synaptic acetylcholine action. Some quaternary cholinesterase inhibitors also have a modest direct action as well, eg, neostigmine, which activates neuromuscular nicotinic cholinoceptors directly in addition to blocking cholinesterase.

\section*{BASIC PHARMACOLOGY OF THE DIRECT-ACTI NG CHOLI NOCEPTOR STI MULANTS}

The direct-acting cholinomimetic drugs can be divided on the basis of chemical structure into esters of choline (including acetylcholine) and alkaloids (such as muscarine and nicotine). A few of these drugs are highly selective for the muscarinic or for the nicotinic receptor. Many have effects on both receptors; acetylcholine is typical.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

\section*{STRUCTURE}

Four important choline esters that have been studied extensively are shown in Figure 7-2. Their permanently charged quaternary ammonium group renders them relatively insoluble in lipids. Many naturally occurring and synthetic cholinomimetic drugs that are not choline esters have been identified; a few of these are shown in Figure 7-3. The muscarinic receptor is strongly stereoselective: (S) -bethanechol is almost 1000 times more potent than (R) -bethanechol.

\section*{ABSORPTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND METABOLISM}

Choline esters are poorly absorbed and poorly distributed into the central nervous system because they are hydrophilic. Although all are hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract (and less active by the oral route), they differ markedly in their susceptibility to hydrolysis by cholinesterase. Acetylcholine is very rapidly hydrolyzed (see Chapter 6); large amounts must be infused intravenously to achieve concentrations sufficient to produce detectable effects. A large intravenous bolus injection has a brief effect, typically 5-20 seconds, whereas intramuscular and subcutaneous injections produce only local effects. Methacholine is more resistant to hydrolysis, and the carbamic acid esters carbachol and bethanechol are still more resistant to hydrolysis by cholinesterase and have correspondingly longer durations of action. The B-methyl group (methacholine, bethanechol) reduces the potency of these drugs at nicotinic receptors (Table 7-2).

The tertiary natural cholinomimetic alkaloids (pilocarpine, nicotine, lobeline; Figure 7-3) are well absorbed from most sites of administration. Nicotine, a liquid, is sufficiently lipid-soluble to be absorbed across the skin. Muscarine, a quaternary amine, is less completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract than the tertiary amines but is nevertheless toxic when ingested, eg, in certain mushrooms, and even enters the brain. Lobeline is a plant derivative similar to nicotine. These amines are excreted chiefly by the kidneys. Acidification of the urine accelerates clearance of the tertiary amines.

Pharmacodynamics

\section*{MECHANI SM OF ACTION}

Activation of the parasympathetic nervous system modifies organ function by two major mechanisms. First, acetylcholine released from parasympathetic nerves activates muscarinic receptors on effector cells to alter organ function directly. Second, acetylcholine released from parasympathetic nerves interacts with muscarinic receptors on nerve terminals to inhibit the release of their neurotransmitter. By this mechanism, acetylcholine release and circulating muscarinic agonists indirectly alter organ function by modulating the effects of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems and perhaps nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (NANC) systems.

As indicated in Chapter 6, muscarinic receptor subtypes have been characterized by binding studies and cloned. Several cellular events occur when muscarinic receptors are activated, one or more of which might serve as second messengers for muscarinic activation. All muscarinic receptors appear to be of the Gprotein coupled type (see Chapter 2 and Table 7-1). Muscarinic agonist binding activates the inositol trisphosphate ( $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ ), diacylglycerol (DAG) cascade. Some evidence implicates DAG in the opening of smooth muscle calcium channels; IP 3 releases calcium from endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum. Muscarinic agonists also increase cellular cGMP concentrations. Activation of muscarinic receptors also increases potassium flux across cardiac cell membranes and decreases it in ganglion and smooth muscle cells. This effect is mediated by the binding of an activated G protein directly to the channel. Finally, muscarinic receptor activation in some tissues (eg, heart, intestine) inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity. Moreover, muscarinic agonists attenuate the activation of adenylyl cyclase and modulate the increase in cAMP levels induced by hormones such as catecholamines. These muscarinic effects on cAMP generation
reduce the physiologic response of the organ to stimulatory hormones.
The mechanism of nicotinic receptor activation has been studied in great detail, taking advantage of three factors: (1) the receptor is present in extremely high concentration in the membranes of the electric organs of electric fish; (2) a-bungarotoxin, a component of certain snake venoms, binds tightly to the receptors and is readily labeled as a marker for isolation procedures; and (3) receptor activation results in easily measured electrical and ionic changes in the cells involved. The nicotinic receptor in muscle tissues is a pentamer of four types of glycoprotein subunits (one monomer occurs twice) with a total molecular weight of about 250,000 (see Figure 2-9). The neuronal nicotinic receptor consists of cand Bsubunits only (Table 7-1). Each subunit has four transmembrane segments. Each asubunit has a receptor site that, when occupied by a nicotinic agonist, causes a conformational change in the protein (channel opening) that allows sodium and potassium ions to diffuse rapidly down their concentration gradients. Binding of an agonist molecule by one of the two asubunit receptor sites only modestly increases the probability of channel opening; simultaneous binding of agonist by both of the receptor sites greatly enhances opening probability. Nicotinic receptor activation causes depolarization of the nerve cell or neuromuscular end plate membrane.

Prolonged agonist occupancy of the nicotinic receptor abolishes the effector response; that is, the postganglionic neuron stops firing (ganglionic effect), and the skeletal muscle cell relaxes (neuromuscular end plate effect). Furthermore, the continued presence of the nicotinic agonist prevents electrical recovery of the postjunctional membrane. Thus, a state of "depolarizing blockade" is induced that is refractory to reversal by other agonists. As noted below, this effect can be exploited for producing muscle paralysis.

\section*{ORGAN SYSTEM EFFECTS}

Most of the direct organ system effects of muscarinic cholinoceptor stimulants are readily predicted from a knowledge of the effects of parasympathetic nerve stimulation (see Table 6-3) and the distribution of muscarinic receptors. Effects of a typical agent such as acetylcholine are listed in Table 7-3. The effects of nicotinic agonists are similarly predictable from a knowledge of the physiology of the autonomic ganglia and skeletal muscle motor end plate.

\section*{Eye}

Muscarinic agonists instilled into the conjunctival sac cause contraction of the smooth muscle of the iris sphincter (resulting in miosis) and of the ciliary muscle (resulting in accommodation). As a result, the iris is pulled away from the angle of the anterior chamber, and the trabecular meshwork at the base of the ciliary muscle is opened. Both effects facilitate aqueous humor outflow into the canal of Schlemm, which drains the anterior chamber.

\section*{Cardiovascular System}

The primary cardiovascular effects of muscarinic agonists are reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and changes in heart rate. The direct effects listed in Table 7-3 are modified by important homeostatic reflexes, as described in Chapter 6 and depicted in Figure 6-7. Intravenous infusions of minimally effective doses of acetylcholine in humans (eg, $20-50 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{min}$ ) cause vasodilation, resulting in a reduction in blood pressure, often accompanied by a reflex increase in heart rate. Larger doses of acetylcholine produce bradycardia and decrease atrioventricular node conduction velocity in addition to hypotension.

The direct cardiac actions of muscarinic stimulants include the following: (1) an increase in a potassium current ( $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{K}(\mathrm{ACh})}$ ) in atrial muscle cells and in the cells of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes as well; (2) a decrease in the slow inward calcium current ( $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ ) in heart cells; and (3) a reduction in the hyperpolarization-activated current ( $I_{f}$ ) that underlies diastolic depolarization. All of these actions are mediated by $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ receptors and contribute to slowing the pacemaker rate. Effects (1) and (2) cause hyperpolarization and decrease the contractility of atrial cells. Predictably, carbachol does not inhibit sinoatrial rate in animals with mutated $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ receptors.

The direct slowing of sinoatrial rate and atrioventricular conduction that is produced by muscarinic agonists is often opposed by reflex sympathetic discharge, elicited by the decrease in blood pressure. The resultant sympathetic-parasympathetic interaction is complex because of the muscarinic modulation of sympathetic influences that occurs by inhibition of norepinephrine release and by postjunctional cellular effects. Muscarinic receptors that are present on postganglionic parasympathetic nerve terminals allow neurally released acetylcholine to inhibit its own secretion. The neuronal muscarinic receptors need not be the same subtype as found on effector cells. Therefore, the net effect on heart rate depends on local concentrations of the agonist in the heart and in the vessels and on the level of reflex responsiveness.

Parasympathetic innervation of the ventricles is much less extensive than that of the atria; activation of ventricular muscarinic receptors causes much less physiologic effect than that seen in atria. However, during sympathetic nerve stimulation, the effects of muscarinic agonists on ventricular function are clearly
evident because of muscarinic modulation of sympathetic effects ("accentuated antagonism").
In the intact organism, muscarinic agonists produce marked vasodilation. However, earlier studies of isolated blood vessels often showed a contractile response to these agents. It is now known that acetylcholine-induced vasodilation requires the presence of intact endothelium (Figure 7-4). Muscarinic agonists release endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) from the endothelial cells that relaxes smooth muscle. Isolated vessels prepared with the endothelium preserved consistently reproduce the vasodilation seen in the intact organism. EDRF appears to be largely nitric oxide (NO). This substance activates guanylyl cyclase and increases cGMP in smooth muscle, resulting in relaxation (see Figure 12-2).

Activation of endothelial cell muscarinic receptors by acetylcholine releases endothelium-derived relaxing factor (nitric oxide) (EDRF [NO]), which causes relaxation of vascular smooth muscle precontracted with norepinephrine. Removal of the endothelium by rubbing eliminates the relaxant effect and reveals contraction caused by direct action of acetylcholine on vascular smooth muscle. (NA, noradrenaline [norepinephrine]; ACh, acetylcholine. Numbers indicate the log concentration applied at the time indicated.) (Modified and reproduced, with permission, from Furchgott RF, Zawadzki JV: The obligatory role of endothelial cells in the relaxation of arterial smooth muscle by acetylcholine. Nature 1980;288:373.)

The cardiovascular effects of all of the choline esters are similar to those of acetylcholine, the main difference being in their potency and duration of action. Because of the resistance of methacholine, carbachol, and bethanechol to acetylcholinesterase, lower doses given intravenously are sufficient to produce effects similar to those of acetylcholine, and the duration of action of these synthetic choline esters is longer. The cardiovascular effects of most of the cholinomimetic natural alkaloids and the synthetic analogs are also generally similar to those of acetylcholine.

Pilocarpine is an interesting exception to the above statement. If given intravenously (an experimental exercise), it may produce hypertension after a brief initial hypotensive response. The longer-lasting
hypertensive effect can be traced to sympathetic ganglionic discharge caused by activation of postganglionic cell membrane $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ receptors, which close $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels and elicit slow excitatory (depolarizing) postsynaptic potentials. This effect, like the hypotensive effect, can be blocked by atropine, an antimuscarinic drug.

\section*{Respiratory System}

Muscarinic stimulants contract the smooth muscle of the bronchial tree. In addition, the glands of the tracheobronchial mucosa are stimulated to secrete. This combination of effects can occasionally cause symptoms, especially in individuals with asthma.

\section*{Gastrointestinal Tract}

Administration of muscarinic agonists, like parasympathetic nervous system stimulation, increases the secretory and motor activity of the gut. The salivary and gastric glands are strongly stimulated; the pancreas and small intestinal glands less so. Peristaltic activity is increased throughout the gut, and most sphincters are relaxed. Stimulation of contraction in this organ system involves depolarization of the smooth muscle cell membrane and increased calcium influx. Muscarinic agonists do not cause contraction of the ileum in mutant mice lacking $M_{2}$ and $M_{3}$ receptors. The $M_{3}$ receptor is required for direct activation of smooth muscle contraction while the $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ receptor reduces cAMP formation and relaxation caused by sympathomimetic drugs.

\section*{Genitourinary Tract}

Muscarinic agonists stimulate the detrusor muscle and relax the trigone and sphincter muscles of the bladder, thus promoting voiding. The function of $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ receptors in the urinary bladder appears to be the same as in intestinal smooth muscle. The human uterus is not notably sensitive to muscarinic agonists.

\section*{Miscellaneous Secretory Glands}

Muscarinic agonists stimulate secretion by thermoregulatory sweat, lacrimal, and nasopharyngeal glands.

\section*{Central Nervous System}

The central nervous system contains both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, the brain being relatively richer in muscarinic sites and the spinal cord containing a preponderance of nicotinic sites. The physiologic roles of these receptors are discussed in Chapter 21.

The role of muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system has been confirmed by experiments in knockout mice. The central nervous system effects of the synthetic muscarinic agonist oxotremorine (tremor, hypothermia, and antinociception) were also lacking in mice with homozygously mutated $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ receptors. Animals lacking $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ receptors, especially those in the hypothalamus, had reduced appetite and diminished body fat mass. Knockout of $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ receptors was associated with different changes in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Oxotremorine did not suppress $M$ current in sympathetic ganglia, and pilocarpine did not induce epileptic seizures in $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ mutant mice.

In spite of the smaller ratio of nicotinic to muscarinic receptors in the brain, nicotine and lobeline (Figure 7-3) have important effects on the brainstem and cortex. The mild alerting action of nicotine absorbed from inhaled tobacco smoke is the best-known of these effects. In high concentrations, nicotine induces tremor, emesis, and stimulation of the respiratory center. At still higher levels, nicotine causes convulsions, which may terminate in fatal coma. The lethal effects on the central nervous system and the fact that nicotine is readily absorbed form the basis for the use of nicotine as an insecticide.

\section*{Peripheral Nervous System}

Autonomic ganglia are important sites of nicotinic synaptic action. The nicotinic agents shown in Figure 7-3 cause marked activation of these nicotinic receptors and initiate action potentials in postganglionic neurons (see Figure 6-8). Nicotine itself has a somewhat greater affinity for neuronal than for skeletal muscle nicotinic receptors. The action is the same on both parasympathetic and sympathetic ganglia. The initial response therefore often resembles simultaneous discharge of both the parasympathetic and the sympathetic nervous systems. In the case of the cardiovascular system, the effects of nicotine are chiefly sympathomimetic. Dramatic hypertension is produced by parenteral injection of nicotine; sympathetic tachycardia may alternate with a bradycardia mediated by vagal discharge. In the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts, the effects are largely parasympathomimetic: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and voiding of urine are commonly observed. Prolonged exposure may result in depolarizing blockade of the ganglia.

Neuronal nicotinic receptors are present on sensory nerve endings—especially afferent nerves in coronary arteries and the carotid and aortic bodies as well as on the glomus cells of the latter. Activation of these receptors by nicotinic stimulants and of muscarinic receptors on glomus cells by muscarinic stimulants elicits complex medullary responses, including respiratory alterations and vagal discharge.

\section*{Neuromuscular J unction}

The nicotinic receptors on the neuromuscular end plate apparatus are similar but not identical to the receptors in the autonomic ganglia (Table 7-1). Both types respond to acetylcholine and nicotine. (However, as discussed in Chapter 8, the receptors differ in their structural requirements for nicotinic blocking drugs.) When a nicotinic agonist is applied directly (by iontophoresis or by intra-arterial injection), an immediate depolarization of the end plate results, caused by an increase in permeability to sodium and potassium ions. The contractile response varies from disorganized fasciculations of independent motor units to a strong contraction of the entire muscle depending on the synchronization of depolarization of end plates throughout the muscle. Depolarizing nicotinic agents that are not rapidly hydrolyzed (like nicotine itself) cause rapid development of depolarization blockade; transmission blockade persists even when the membrane has repolarized (discussed further in Chapters 8 and 27). This block is manifested as flaccid paralysis in the case of skeletal muscle.

\section*{BASI C PHARMACOLOGY OF THE INDI RECT-ACTI NG CHOLI NOMI METI CS}

The actions of acetylcholine released from autonomic and somatic motor nerves are terminated by enzymatic hydrolysis of the molecule. Hydrolysis is accomplished by the action of acetylcholinesterase, which is present in high concentrations in cholinergic synapses. The indirect-acting cholinomimetics have their primary effect at the active site of this enzyme, although some also have direct actions at nicotinic receptors. The chief differences between members of the group are chemical and pharmacokinetic-their pharmacodynamic properties are almost identical.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

\section*{STRUCTURE}

There are three chemical groups of cholinesterase inhibitors: (1) simple alcohols bearing a quaternary ammonium group, eg, edrophonium; (2) carbamic acid esters of alcohols bearing quaternary or tertiary ammonium groups (carbamates, eg, neostigmine); and (3) organic derivatives of phosphoric acid (organophosphates, eg, echothiophate). Examples of the first two groups are shown in Figure 7-5 . Edrophonium, neostigmine, and pyridostigmine are synthetic quaternary ammonium agents used in medicine. Physostigmine (eserine) is a naturally occurring tertiary amine of greater lipid solubility that is
also used in therapeutics. Carbaryl (carbaril) is typical of a large group of carbamate insecticides designed for very high lipid solubility, so that absorption into the insect and distribution to its central nervous system are very rapid.

Cholinesterase inhibitors. Neostigmine exemplifies the typical ester composed of carbamic acid ([1]) and a phenol bearing a quaternary ammonium group ([2]). Physostigmine, a naturally occurring carbamate, is a tertiary amine. Edrophonium is not an ester but binds to the active site of the enzyme.

A few of the estimated 50,000 organophosphates are shown in Figure 7-6. Many of the organophosphates (echothiophate is an exception) are highly lipid-soluble liquids. Echothiophate, a thiocholine derivative, is of clinical value because it retains the very long duration of action of other organophosphates but is more stable in aqueous solution. Soman is an extremely potent "nerve gas." Parathion and malathion are thiophosphate prodrugs that are inactive as such; they are converted to the phosphate derivatives in animals and plants and are used as insecticides.

\section*{ABSORPTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND METABOLISM}

Absorption of the quaternary carbamates from the conjunctiva, skin, and lungs is predictably poor, since their permanent charge renders them relatively insoluble in lipids. Thus, much larger doses are required for oral administration than for parenteral injection. Distribution into the central nervous system is negligible. Physostigmine, in contrast, is well absorbed from all sites and can be used topically in the eye (see Table 7-4). It is distributed into the central nervous system and is more toxic than the more polar quaternary carbamates. The carbamates are relatively stable in aqueous solution but can be metabolized by nonspecific esterases in the body as well as by cholinesterase. However, the duration of their effect is determined chiefly by the stability of the inhibitor-enzyme complex (see Mechanism of Action, below), not by metabolism or excretion.

The organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitors (except for echothiophate) are well absorbed from the skin, lung, gut, and conjunctiva—thereby making them dangerous to humans and highly effective as insecticides. They are relatively less stable than the carbamates when dissolved in water and thus have a limited half-life in the environment (compared with the other major class of insecticides, the halogenated hydrocarbons, eg, DDT). Echothiophate is highly polar and more stable than most other organophosphates. When prepared in aqueous solution for ophthalmic use, it retains activity for weeks.

The thiophosphate insecticides (parathion, malathion, and related compounds) are quite lipid-soluble and are rapidly absorbed by all routes. They must be activated in the body by conversion to the oxygen analogs (Figure 7-6), a process that occurs rapidly in both insects and vertebrates. Malathion and a few other organophosphate insecticides are also rapidly metabolized by other pathways to inactive products in birds and mammals but not in insects; these agents are therefore considered safe enough for sale to the general public. Unfortunately, fish cannot detoxify malathion, and significant numbers of fish have died from the
heavy use of this agent on and near waterways. Parathion is not detoxified effectively in vertebrates; thus, it is considerably more dangerous than malathion to humans and livestock and is not available for general public use.

All of the organophosphates except echothiophate are distributed to all parts of the body, including the central nervous system. Poisoning with these agents therefore includes an important component of central nervous system toxicity.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

\section*{MECHANI SM OF ACTION}

Acetylcholinesterase is the primary target of these drugs, but butyrylcholinesterase is also inhibited. Acetylcholinesterase is an extremely active enzyme. In the initial catalytic step, acetylcholine binds to the enzyme's active site and is hydrolyzed, yielding free choline and the acetylated enzyme. In the second step, the covalent acetylenzyme bond is split, with the addition of water (hydration). The entire process takes place in approximately 150 microseconds.

All of the cholinesterase inhibitors increase the concentration of endogenous acetylcholine at cholinoceptors by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. However, the molecular details of their interaction with the enzyme vary according to the three chemical subgroups mentioned above.

The first group, of which edrophonium is the major example, consists of quaternary alcohols. These agents reversibly bind electrostatically and by hydrogen bonds to the active site, thus preventing access of acetylcholine. The enzyme-inhibitor complex does not involve a covalent bond and is correspondingly shortlived (on the order of 2-10 minutes). The second group consists of carbamate esters, eg, neostigmine and physostigmine. These agents undergo a two-step hydrolysis sequence analogous to that described for acetylcholine. However, the covalent bond of the carbamoylated enzyme is considerably more resistant to the second (hydration) process, and this step is correspondingly prolonged (on the order of 30 minutes to 6 hours). The third group consists of the organophosphates. These agents also undergo initial binding and hydrolysis by the enzyme, resulting in a phosphorylated active site. The covalent phosphorus-enzyme bond is extremely stable and hydrolyzes in water at a very slow rate (hundreds of hours). After the initial binding-hydrolysis step, the phosphorylated enzyme complex may undergo a process called aging. This process apparently involves the breaking of one of the oxygen-phosphorus bonds of the inhibitor and further strengthens the phosphorus-enzyme bond. The rate of aging varies with the particular organophosphate compound. If given before aging has occurred, strong nucleophiles like pralidoxime are able to break the phosphorus-enzyme bond and can be used as "cholinesterase regenerator" drugs for organophosphate insecticide poisoning (see Chapter 8). Once aging has occurred, the enzyme-inhibitor complex is even more stable and is more difficult to break, even with oxime regenerator compounds.

The organophosphate inhibitors are sometimes referred to as "irreversible" cholinesterase inhibitors, and edrophonium and the carbamates are considered "reversible" inhibitors because of the marked differences in duration of action. However, the molecular mechanisms of action of the three groups do not support this simplistic description.

\section*{ORGAN SYSTEM EFFECTS}

The most prominent pharmacologic effects of cholinesterase inhibitors are on the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems, the eye, and the skeletal muscle neuromuscular junction. Because the primary action is to amplify the actions of endogenous acetylcholine, the effects are similar (but not always
identical) to the effects of the direct-acting cholinomimetic agonists.

\section*{Central Nervous System}

In low concentrations, the lipid-soluble cholinesterase inhibitors cause diffuse activation on the electroencephalogram and a subjective alerting response. In higher concentrations, they cause generalized convulsions, which may be followed by coma and respiratory arrest.

\section*{Eye, Respiratory Tract, Gastrointestinal Tract, Urinary Tract}

The effects of the cholinesterase inhibitors on these organ systems, all of which are well innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system, are qualitatively quite similar to the effects of the direct-acting cholinomimetics (Table 7-3).

\section*{Cardiovascular System}

The cholinesterase inhibitors can increase activity in both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia supplying the heart and at the acetylcholine receptors on neuroeffector cells (cardiac and vascular smooth muscles) that receive cholinergic innervation.

In the heart, the effects on the parasympathetic limb predominate. Thus, cholinesterase inhibitors such as edrophonium, physostigmine, or neostigmine mimic the effects of vagal nerve activation on the heart. Negative chronotropic, dromotropic, and inotropic effects are produced, and cardiac output falls. The fall in cardiac output is attributable to bradycardia, decreased atrial contractility, and some reduction in ventricular contractility. The latter effect occurs as a result of prejunctional inhibition of norepinephrine release as well as inhibition of postjunctional cellular sympathetic effects.

Cholinesterase inhibitors have less marked effects on vascular smooth muscle and on blood pressure than direct-acting muscarinic agonists. This is because indirect-acting drugs can modify the tone of only those vessels that are innervated by cholinergic nerves and because the net effects on vascular tone may reflect activation of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. The cholinomimetic effect at the smooth muscle effector tissue is minimal since few vascular beds receive cholinergic innervation. Activation of sympathetic ganglia may increase vascular resistance.

The net cardiovascular effects of moderate doses of cholinesterase inhibitors therefore consist of modest bradycardia, a fall in cardiac output, and no change or a modest fall in blood pressure. Large (toxic) doses of these drugs cause more marked bradycardia (occasionally tachycardia) and hypotension.

\section*{Neuromuscular J unction}

The cholinesterase inhibitors have important therapeutic and toxic effects at the skeletal muscle neuromuscular junction. Low (therapeutic) concentrations moderately prolong and intensify the actions of physiologically released acetylcholine. This increases strength of contraction, especially in muscles weakened by curare-like neuromuscular blocking agents or by myasthenia gravis. At higher concentrations, the accumulation of acetylcholine may result in fibrillation of muscle fibers. Antidromic firing of the motor neuron may also occur, resulting in fasciculations that involve an entire motor unit. With marked inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, depolarizing neuromuscular blockade occurs and that may be followed by a phase of nondepolarizing blockade as seen with succinylcholine (see Table 27-2 and Figure 27-7).

Some quaternary carbamate cholinesterase inhibitors, eg, neostigmine, have an additional direct nicotinic agonist effect at the neuromuscular junction. This may contribute to the effectiveness of these agents as therapy for myasthenia.

\section*{CLI NI CAL PHARMACOLOGY OF THE CHOLI NOMI METI CS}

The major therapeutic uses of the cholinomimetics are for diseases of the eye (glaucoma, accommodative esotropia), the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts (postoperative atony, neurogenic bladder), the neuromuscular junction (myasthenia gravis, curare-induced neuromuscular paralysis), and very rarely, the heart (certain atrial arrhythmias). Cholinesterase inhibitors are occasionally used in the treatment of atropine overdosage. Several newer cholinesterase inhibitors are being used to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease.

\section*{Clinical Uses}

\section*{THE EYE}

Glaucoma is a disease characterized by increased intraocular pressure. Muscarinic stimulants and cholinesterase inhibitors reduce intraocular pressure by causing contraction of the ciliary body so as to facilitate outflow of aqueous humor and perhaps also by diminishing the rate of its secretion (see Figure 6-9). In the past, glaucoma was treated with either direct agonists (pilocarpine, methacholine, carbachol) or cholinesterase inhibitors (physostigmine, demecarium, echothiophate, isoflurophate). For chronic glaucoma, these drugs have been largely replaced by topical B-blockers and prostaglandin derivatives.

Acute angle-closure glaucoma is a medical emergency that is frequently treated initially with drugs but usually requires surgery for permanent correction. Initial therapy often consists of a combination of a direct muscarinic agonist and a cholinesterase inhibitor (eg, pilocarpine plus physostigmine) as well as other drugs. Once the intraocular pressure is controlled and the danger of vision loss is diminished, the patient can be prepared for corrective surgery (iridectomy). Open-angle glaucoma and some cases of secondary glaucoma are chronic diseases that are not amenable to traditional surgical correction although newer laser techniques appear to be useful. Other treatments for glaucoma are described in Treatment of Glaucoma in Chapter 10 .

Accommodative esotropia (strabismus caused by hypermetropic accommodative error) in young children is sometimes diagnosed and treated with cholinomimetic agonists. Dosage is similar to or higher than that used for glaucoma.

\section*{GASTROI NTESTI NAL AND URI NARY TRACTS}

In clinical disorders that involve depression of smooth muscle activity without obstruction, cholinomimetic drugs with direct or indirect muscarinic effects may be helpful. These disorders include postoperative ileus (atony or paralysis of the stomach or bowel following surgical manipulation) and congenital megacolon. Urinary retention may occur postoperatively or postpartum or may be secondary to spinal cord injury or disease (neurogenic bladder). Cholinomimetics are also sometimes used to increase the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter in patients with reflux esophagitis. Of the choline esters, bethanechol is the most widely used for these disorders. For gastrointestinal problems, it is usually administered orally in a dose of $10-25 \mathrm{mg}$ three or four times daily. In patients with urinary retention, bethanechol can be given subcutaneously in a dose of 5 mg and repeated in 30 minutes if necessary. Of the cholinesterase inhibitors, neostigmine is the most widely used for these applications. For paralytic ileus or atony of the urinary bladder, neostigmine can be given subcutaneously in a dose of $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg}$. If patients are able to take the drug by mouth, neostigmine can be given orally in a dose of 15 mg . In all of these situations, the clinician must be certain that there is no mechanical obstruction to outflow prior to using the cholinomimetic. Otherwise, the drug may exacerbate the problem and may even cause perforation as a result of increased
pressure.
Pilocarpine has long been used to increase salivary secretion. Cevimeline, a quinuclidine derivative of acetylcholine, is a new direct-acting muscarinic agonist used for the treatment of dry mouth associated with Sjögren's syndrome.

\section*{NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION}

Myasthenia gravis is a disease affecting skeletal muscle neuromuscular junctions. An autoimmune process causes production of antibodies that bind to the asubunits of the nicotinic receptor. This effect causes accelerated degradation of the receptor and blockade of acetylcholine binding to receptors on muscle end plates. Frequent findings are ptosis, diplopia, difficulty in speaking and swallowing, and extremity weakness. Severe disease may affect all the muscles, including those necessary for respiration. The disease resembles the neuromuscular paralysis produced by d-tubocurarine and similar nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs (see Chapter 27). Patients with myasthenia are exquisitely sensitive to the action of curariform drugs and other drugs that interfere with neuromuscular transmission, eg, aminoglycoside antibiotics.

Cholinesterase inhibitors—but not direct-acting acetylcholine receptor agonists—are extremely valuable as therapy for myasthenia. Almost all patients are also treated with immunosuppressant drugs and some with thymectomy.

Edrophonium is sometimes used as a diagnostic test for myasthenia. A 2 mg dose is injected intravenously after baseline measurements of muscle strength have been obtained. If no reaction occurs after 45 seconds, an additional 8 mg may be injected. If the patient has myasthenia gravis, an improvement in muscle strength that lasts about 5 minutes will usually be observed.

Edrophonium is also used to assess the adequacy of treatment with the longer-acting cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with myasthenia gravis. If excessive amounts of cholinesterase inhibitor have been used, patients may become paradoxically weak because of nicotinic depolarizing blockade of the motor end plate. These patients may also exhibit symptoms of excessive stimulation of muscarinic receptors (abdominal cramps, diarrhea, increased salivation, excessive bronchial secretions, miosis, bradycardia). Small doses of edrophonium ( $1-2 \mathrm{mg}$ intravenously) will produce no relief or even worsen weakness if the patient is receiving excessive cholinesterase inhibitor therapy. On the other hand, if the patient improves with edrophonium, an increase in cholinesterase inhibitor dosage may be indicated. Clinical situations in which severe myasthenia (myasthenic crisis) must be distinguished from excessive drug therapy (cholinergic crisis) usually occur in very ill myasthenic patients and must be managed in hospital with adequate emergency support systems (eg, mechanical ventilators) available.

Long-term therapy for myasthenia gravis is usually accomplished with pyridostigmine; neostigmine or ambenonium are alternatives. The doses are titrated to optimum levels based on changes in muscle strength. These agents are relatively short-acting and therefore require frequent dosing (every 6 hours for pyridostigmine and ambenonium and every 4 hours for neostigmine; Table 7-4). Sustained-release preparations are available but should be used only at night and if needed. Longer-acting cholinesterase inhibitors such as the organophosphate agents are not used, because the dose requirement in this disease changes too rapidly to permit smooth control with long-acting drugs.

If muscarinic effects of such therapy are prominent, they can be controlled by the administration of antimuscarinic drugs such as atropine. Frequently, tolerance to the muscarinic effects of the cholinesterase
inhibitors develops, so atropine treatment is not required.
Neuromuscular blockade is frequently produced as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, using nondepolarizing neuromuscular relaxants such as pancuronium and newer agents (see Chapter 27). Following surgery, it is usually desirable to reverse this pharmacologic paralysis promptly. This can be easily accomplished with cholinesterase inhibitors; neostigmine and edrophonium are the drugs of choice. They are given intravenously or intramuscularly for prompt effect.

\section*{HEART}

The short-acting cholinesterase inhibitor edrophonium was used to treat supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, particularly paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. In this application, edrophonium has been replaced by newer drugs (adenosine and the calcium channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem).

\section*{ANTI MUSCARINIC DRUG INTOXICATION}

Atropine intoxication is potentially lethal in children (see Chapter 8) and may cause prolonged severe behavioral disturbances and arrhythmias in adults. The tricyclic antidepressants, when taken in overdosage (often with suicidal intent), also cause severe muscarinic blockade (see Chapter 30). The muscarinic receptor blockade produced by all these agents is competitive in nature and can be overcome by increasing the amount of endogenous acetylcholine present at the neuroeffector junctions. Theoretically, a cholinesterase inhibitor could be used to reverse these effects. Physostigmine has been used for this application, because it enters the central nervous system and reverses the central as well as the peripheral signs of muscarinic blockade. However, as noted previously, physostigmine itself can produce dangerous central nervous system effects, and such therapy is therefore used only in patients with dangerous elevation of body temperature or very rapid supraventricular tachycardia.

\section*{CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM}

Tacrine is a drug with anticholinesterase and other cholinomimetic actions that has been used for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Tacrine's efficacy is modest and hepatic toxicity is significant. Donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine are newer, more selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that appear to have the same modest clinical benefit as tacrine in treatment of cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's patients. Donepezil may be given once daily because of its long half-life, and it lacks the hepatotoxic effect of tacrine. However, no comparative trials of these newer drugs and tacrine have been reported. These drugs are discussed in Chapter 61.

Varenicline is a new direct-acting nicotinic agonist that is approved for use in smoking cessation treatment. It appears to have some selectivity for the $Q_{2} B_{2}$ isoform of the $N_{N}$ receptor. It is orally active and has a half-life of 14-20 hours. Toxicity includes nausea, headache, and sleep disturbances.

\section*{Toxicity}

The toxic potential of the cholinoceptor stimulants varies markedly depending on their absorption, access to the central nervous system, and metabolism.

\section*{DIRECT-ACTINGMUSCARINIC STIMULANTS}

Drugs such as pilocarpine and the choline esters cause predictable signs of muscarinic excess when given in overdosage. These effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, urinary urgency, salivation, sweating, cutaneous vasodilation, and bronchial constriction. The effects are all blocked competitively by atropine and its congeners.

Certain mushrooms, especially those of the genus Inocybe, contain muscarinic alkaloids. Ingestion of these mushrooms causes typical signs of muscarinic excess within 15-30 minutes. Treatment is with atropine, $1-2 \mathrm{mg}$ parenterally. (Amanita muscaria, the first source of muscarine, contains very low concentrations of the alkaloid.)

\section*{DIRECT-ACTING NI COTI NIC STI MULANTS}

Nicotine itself is the only common cause of this type of poisoning. The acute toxicity of the alkaloid is welldefined but much less important than the chronic effects associated with smoking. In addition to tobacco products, nicotine is also used in insecticides.

\section*{Acute Toxicity}

The fatal dose of nicotine is approximately 40 mg , or 1 drop of the pure liquid. This is the amount of nicotine in two regular cigarettes. Fortunately, most of the nicotine in cigarettes is destroyed by burning or escapes via the "sidestream" smoke. Ingestion of nicotine insecticides or of tobacco by infants and children is usually followed by vomiting, limiting the amount of the alkaloid absorbed.

The toxic effects of a large dose of nicotine are simple extensions of the effects described previously. The most dangerous are (1) central stimulant actions, which cause convulsions and may progress to coma and respiratory arrest; (2) skeletal muscle end plate depolarization, which may lead to depolarization blockade and respiratory paralysis; and (3) hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias.

Treatment of acute nicotine poisoning is largely symptom-directed. Muscarinic excess resulting from parasympathetic ganglion stimulation can be controlled with atropine. Central stimulation is usually treated with parenteral anticonvulsants such as diazepam. Neuromuscular blockade is not responsive to pharmacologic treatment and may require mechanical respiration.

Fortunately, nicotine is metabolized and excreted relatively rapidly. Patients who survive the first 4 hours usually recover completely if hypoxia and brain damage have not occurred.

\section*{Chronic Nicotine Toxicity}

The health costs of tobacco smoking to the smoker and its socioeconomic costs to the general public are still incompletely understood. However, the 1979 Surgeon General's Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention stated that "cigarette smoking is clearly the largest single preventable cause of illness and premature death in the United States." This statement has been supported by numerous subsequent studies. Unfortunately, the fact that the most important of the tobacco-associated diseases are delayed in onset reduces the health incentive to stop smoking.

Clearly, the addictive power of cigarettes is directly related to their nicotine content. It is not known to what extent nicotine per se contributes to the other well-documented adverse effects of chronic tobacco use. It appears highly probable that nicotine contributes to the increased risk of vascular disease and sudden coronary death associated with smoking. Also, nicotine probably contributes to the high incidence of ulcer recurrences in smokers with peptic ulcer.

\section*{CHOLI NESTERASE INHIBITORS}

The acute toxic effects of the cholinesterase inhibitors, like those of the direct-acting agents, are direct extensions of their pharmacologic actions. The major source of such intoxications is pesticide use in agriculture and in the home. Approximately 100 organophosphate and 20 carbamate cholinesterase inhibitors are available in pesticides and veterinary vermifuges used in the USA.

Acute intoxication must be recognized and treated promptly in patients with heavy exposure. The dominant initial signs are those of muscarinic excess: miosis, salivation, sweating, bronchial constriction, vomiting, and diarrhea. Central nervous system involvement usually follows rapidly, accompanied by peripheral nicotinic effects, especially depolarizing neuromuscular blockade. Therapy always includes (1) maintenance of vital signs-respiration in particular may be impaired; (2) decontamination to prevent further absorption-this may require removal of all clothing and washing of the skin in cases of exposure to dusts and sprays; and (3) atropine parenterally in large doses, given as often as required to control signs of muscarinic excess. Therapy often also includes treatment with pralidoxime as described in Chapter 8.

Chronic exposure to certain organophosphate compounds, including some organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitors, causes neuropathy associated with demyelination of axons. Triorthocresylphosphate, an additive in lubricating oils, is the prototype agent of this class. The effects are not caused by cholinesterase inhibition.

\section*{CHOLI NOCEPTOR-BLOCKI NG DRUGS: I NTRODUCTION}

Cholinoceptor antagonists, like agonists, are divided into muscarinic and nicotinic subgroups on the basis of their specific receptor affinities. Ganglion-blockers and neuromuscular junction blockers comprise the antinicotinic drugs. The ganglion-blocking drugs have little clinical use and are discussed at the end of this chapter. The neuromuscular blockers are discussed in Chapter 27. This chapter emphasizes drugs that block muscarinic cholinoceptors.

Five subtypes of muscarinic receptors have been identified, primarily on the basis of data from ligandbinding and cDNA-cloning experiments (see Chapters 6 and 7). A standard terminology ( $M_{1}$ through $M_{5}$ ) for these subtypes is now in common use, and evidence, based mostly on selective agonists and antagonists, indicates that functional differences exist between several of these subtypes.

As suggested in Chapter 6, the $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ receptor subtype is located on central nervous system neurons, sympathetic postganglionic cell bodies, and many presynaptic sites. $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ receptors are located in the myocardium, smooth muscle organs, and some neuronal sites. $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ receptors are most common on effector cell membranes, especially glandular and smooth muscle cells.

\section*{BASIC PHARMACOLOGY OF THE MUSCARI NI C RECEPTOR-BLOCKI NG DRUGS}

Muscarinic antagonists are sometimes called parasympatholytic because they block the effects of parasympathetic autonomic discharge. However, they do not "lyse" parasympathetic nerves, and they have some effects that are not predictable from block of the parasympathetic nervous system. For these reasons, the term "antimuscarinic" is preferable.

Naturally occurring compounds with antimuscarinic effects have been known and used for millennia as medicines, poisons, and cosmetics. Atropine is the prototype of these drugs. Many similar plant alkaloids are known, and hundreds of synthetic antimuscarinic compounds have been prepared.

\section*{Chemistry \& Pharmacokinetics}

\section*{SOURCE AND CHEMISTRY}

Atropine and its naturally occurring congeners are tertiary amine alkaloid esters of tropic acid (Figure 8-1). Atropine (hyoscyamine) is found in the plant Atropa belladonna, or deadly nightshade, and in Datura stramonium, also known as jimsonweed (Jamestown weed), sacred Datura, or thorn apple. Scopolamine (hyoscine) occurs in Hyoscyamus niger, or henbane, as the I (-) stereoisomer. Naturally occurring atropine is $I(-)$-hyoscyamine, but the compound readily racemizes, so the commercial material is racemic d, Ihyoscyamine. The I (-) isomers of both alkaloids are at least 100 times more potent than the $\mathrm{d}(+)$ isomers.

The structure of atropine (oxygen at [1] is missing) or scopolamine (oxygen present). In homatropine, the hydroxymethyl at [2] is replaced by a hydroxyl group, and the oxygen at [1] is absent.

A variety of semisynthetic and fully synthetic molecules have antimuscarinic effects.
The tertiary members of these classes (Figure 8-2) are often used for their effects on the eye or the central nervous system. Many antihistaminic (see Chapter 16), antipsychotic (see Chapter 29), and antidepressant (see Chapter 30) drugs have similar structures and, predictably, significant antimuscarinic effects.

Structures of some semisynthetic and synthetic antimuscarinic drugs.

Quaternary amine antimuscarinic agents (Figure 8-2) have been developed to produce more peripheral effects with reduced central nervous system effects.

\section*{ABSORPTION}

The natural alkaloids and most tertiary antimuscarinic drugs are well absorbed from the gut and conjunctival membranes. When applied in a suitable vehicle, some (eg, scopolamine) are even absorbed across the skin (transdermal route). In contrast, only 10-30\% of a dose of a quaternary antimuscarinic drug is absorbed
after oral administration, reflecting the decreased lipid solubility of the charged molecule.

\section*{DISTRI BUTION}

Atropine and the other tertiary agents are widely distributed in the body. Significant levels are achieved in the central nervous system within 30 minutes to 1 hour, and this can limit the dose tolerated when the drug is taken for its peripheral effects. Scopolamine is rapidly and fully distributed into the central nervous system where it has greater effects than most other antimuscarinic drugs. In contrast, the quaternary derivatives are poorly taken up by the brain and therefore are relatively free-at low doses-of central nervous system effects.

\section*{METABOLISM AND EXCRETION}

After administration, atropine disappears rapidly from the blood with a half-life of 2 hours. About $60 \%$ of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the rest appears in the urine as hydrolysis and conjugation products. The drug's effect on parasympathetic function declines rapidly in all organs except the eye. Effects on the iris and ciliary muscle persist for $\geq 72$ hours.

\section*{Pharmacodynamics}

\section*{MECHANI SM OF ACTION}

Atropine causes reversible (surmountable) blockade (see Chapter 2) of cholinomimetic actions at muscarinic receptors-ie, blockade by a small dose of atropine can be overcome by a larger concentration of acetylcholine or equivalent muscarinic agonist. Mutation experiments suggest that aspartate in the receptor forms the characteristic bond with the nitrogen atom of acetylcholine; this amino acid is also required for binding of antimuscarinic drugs. When atropine binds to the muscarinic receptor, it prevents actions such as the release of inositol trisphosphate ( $I P_{3}$ ) and the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase that are caused by muscarinic agonists (see Chapter 7).

The effectiveness of antimuscarinic drugs varies with the tissue and with the source of agonist. Tissues most sensitive to atropine are the salivary, bronchial, and sweat glands. Secretion of acid by the gastric parietal cells is the least sensitive. In most tissues, antimuscarinic agents block exogenously administered cholinoceptor agonists more effectively than endogenously released acetylcholine.

Atropine is highly selective for muscarinic receptors. Its potency at nicotinic receptors is much lower, and actions at nonmuscarinic receptors are generally undetectable clinically.

Atropine does not distinguish between the $\mathrm{M}_{1}, \mathrm{M}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ subgroups of muscarinic receptors. In contrast, other antimuscarinic drugs are moderately selective for one or another of these subgroups (Table 8-1). Most synthetic antimuscarinic drugs are considerably less selective than atropine in interactions with nonmuscarinic receptors. For example, some quaternary amine antimuscarinic agents have significant ganglion-blocking actions, and others are potent histamine receptor blockers. The antimuscarinic effects of other agents, eg, antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs, have been mentioned. Their relative selectivity for muscarinic receptor subtypes has not been defined.

\section*{ORGAN SYSTEM EFFECTS}

\section*{Central Nervous System}

In the doses usually used, atropine has minimal stimulant effects on the central nervous system, especially the parasympathetic medullary centers, and a slower, longer-lasting sedative effect on the brain.
Scopolamine has more marked central effects, producing drowsiness when given in recommended dosages and amnesia in sensitive individuals. In toxic doses, scopolamine and to a lesser degree atropine can cause excitement, agitation, hallucinations, and coma.

The tremor of Parkinson's disease is reduced by centrally acting antimuscarinic drugs, and atropine-in the form of belladonna extract-was one of the first drugs used in the therapy of this disease. As discussed in Chapter 28, parkinsonian tremor and rigidity seem to result from a relative excess of cholinergic activity because of a deficiency of dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia-striatum system. The combination of an antimuscarinic agent with a dopamine precursor drug (levodopa) can sometimes provide more effective therapy than either drug alone.

Vestibular disturbances, especially motion sickness, appear to involve muscarinic cholinergic transmission. Scopolamine is often effective in preventing or reversing these disturbances.

\section*{Eye}

The pupillary constrictor muscle (see Figure 6-9) depends on muscarinic cholinoceptor activation. This activation is blocked by topical atropine and other tertiary antimuscarinic drugs and results in unopposed sympathetic dilator activity and mydriasis (Figure 8-3). Dilated pupils were considered cosmetically desirable during the Renaissance and account for the name belladonna (Italian, "beautiful lady") applied to the plant and its active extract because of the use of the extract as eye drops during that time.
Figure 8-3.

Effects of topical scopolamine drops on pupil diameter (mm) and accommodation (diopters) in the normal human eye. One drop of $0.5 \%$ solution of drug was applied at zero time, and a second drop was administered at 30 minutes (arrows ). The responses of 42 eyes were averaged. Note the extremely slow recovery. (Redrawn from Marron J: Cycloplegia and mydriasis by use of atropine, scopolamine, and homatropine-paredrine. Arch Ophthalmol 1940; 23: 340.)

The second important ocular effect of antimuscarinic drugs is to weaken contraction of the ciliary muscle, or cycloplegia. Cycloplegia results in loss of the ability to accommodate; the fully atropinized eye cannot focus for near vision (Figure 8-3).

Both mydriasis and cycloplegia are useful in ophthalmology. They are also potentially hazardous, since acute glaucoma may be induced in patients with a narrow anterior chamber angle.

A third ocular effect of antimuscarinic drugs is to reduce lacrimal secretion. Patients occasionally complain of dry or "sandy" eyes when receiving large doses of antimuscarinic drugs.

\section*{Cardiovascular System}

The sinoatrial node is very sensitive to muscarinic receptor blockade. Moderate to high therapeutic doses of atropine cause tachycardia in the innervated and spontaneously beating heart by blockade of vagal slowing. However, lower doses often result in initial bradycardia before the effects of peripheral vagal block become manifest (Figure 8-4). This slowing may be due to block of prejunctional $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ receptors (autoreceptors, see Chapter 6) on vagal postganglionic fibers that normally limit acetylcholine release in the sinus node and other tissues. The same mechanisms operate in the atrioventricular node; in the presence of high vagal tone, atropine can significantly reduce the PR interval of the electrocardiogram by blocking muscarinic receptors in the atrioventricular node. Muscarinic effects on atrial muscle are similarly blocked, but these effects are of no clinical significance except in atrial flutter and fibrillation. The ventricles are less affected by antimuscarinic drugs at therapeutic levels because of a lesser degree of muscarinic control. In toxic
concentrations, the drugs can cause intraventricular conduction block that has been attributed to a local anesthetic action.

Effects of increasing doses of atropine on heart rate ( $\mathbf{A}$ ) and salivary flow ( $\mathbf{B}$ ) compared with muscarinic receptor occupancy in humans. The parasympathomimetic effect of low-dose atropine is attributed to blockade of prejunctional muscarinic receptors that suppress acetylcholine release. (Modified and reproduced, with permission, from Wellstein A, Pitschner HF: Complex dose-response curves of atropine in man explained by different functions of $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ cholinoceptors. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 1988; 338: 19.)

Most blood vessels receive no direct innervation from the parasympathetic system. However, parasympathetic nerve stimulation dilates coronary arteries, and sympathetic cholinergic nerves cause vasodilation in the skeletal muscle vascular bed (see Chapter 6). Atropine can block this vasodilation. Furthermore, almost all vessels contain endothelial muscarinic receptors that mediate vasodilation (see Chapter 7). These receptors are readily blocked by antimuscarinic drugs. At toxic doses, and in some individuals at normal doses, antimuscarinic agents cause cutaneous vasodilation, especially in the upper portion of the body. The mechanism is unknown.

The net cardiovascular effects of atropine in patients with normal hemodynamics are not dramatic: tachycardia may occur, but there is little effect on blood pressure. However, the cardiovascular effects of administered direct-acting muscarinic agonists are easily prevented.

\section*{Respiratory System}

Both smooth muscle and secretory glands of the airway receive vagal innervation and contain muscarinic receptors. Even in normal individuals, administration of atropine can cause some bronchodilation and reduce secretion. The effect is more significant in patients with airway disease, although the antimuscarinic drugs are not as useful as the B-adrenoceptor stimulants in the treatment of asthma (see Chapter 20). The effectiveness of unselective antimuscarinic drugs in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is limited because block of autoinhibitory $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ receptors on postganglionic parasympathetic nerves can
oppose the bronchodilation caused by block of $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ receptors on airway smooth muscle. Nevertheless, antimuscarinic agents are valuable in some patients with asthma or COPD.

Antimuscarinic drugs are frequently used prior to administration of inhalant anesthetics to reduce the accumulation of secretions in the trachea and the possibility of laryngospasm.

\section*{Gastrointestinal Tract}

Blockade of muscarinic receptors has dramatic effects on motility and some of the secretory functions of the gut. However, even complete muscarinic block cannot totally abolish activity in this organ system since local hormones and noncholinergic neurons in the enteric nervous system (see Chapters 6 and 63) also modulate gastrointestinal function. As in other tissues, exogenously administered muscarinic stimulants are more effectively blocked than the effects of parasympathetic (vagal) nerve activity. The removal of autoinhibition, a negative feedback mechanism by which neural acetylcholine suppresses its own release, might explain the greater efficacy of antimuscarinic drugs against exogenous muscarinic stimulants.

Antimuscarinic drugs have marked effects on salivary secretion; dry mouth occurs frequently in patients taking antimuscarinic drugs for Parkinson's disease or urinary conditions (Figure 8-5). Gastric secretion is blocked less effectively: the volume and amount of acid, pepsin, and mucin are all reduced, but large doses of atropine may be required. Basal secretion is blocked more effectively than that stimulated by food, nicotine, or alcohol. Pirenzepine and a more potent analog, telenzepine, reduce gastric acid secretion with fewer adverse effects than atropine and other less selective agents. This results from a selective blockade of presynaptic excitatory muscarinic receptors on vagal nerve endings as suggested by their high ratio of $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ to $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ affinity (Table 8-1). Pirenzepine and telenzepine are investigational in the USA. Pancreatic and intestinal secretion are little affected by atropine; these processes are primarily under hormonal rather than vagal control.
Figure 8-5.

accommodation in normal adults. Note that salivation is the most sensitive of these variables, accommodation the least. (Data from Herxheimer A: BrJ Pharmacol 1958; 13: 184.)

Gastrointestinal smooth muscle motility is affected from the stomach to the colon. In general, the walls of the viscera are relaxed, and both tone and propulsive movements are diminished. Therefore, gastric emptying time is prolonged, and intestinal transit time is lengthened. Diarrhea due to overdosage with parasympathomimetic agents is readily stopped, and even that caused by nonautonomic agents can usually be temporarily controlled. However, intestinal "paralysis" induced by antimuscarinic drugs is temporary; local mechanisms within the enteric nervous system will usually reestablish at least some peristalsis after 1-3 days of antimuscarinic drug therapy.

\section*{Genitourinary Tract}

The antimuscarinic action of atropine and its analogs relaxes smooth muscle of the ureters and bladder wall and slows voiding (Figure 8-5). This action is useful in the treatment of spasm induced by mild inflammation, surgery, and certain neurologic conditions, but it can precipitate urinary retention in men who have prostatic hyperplasia (see following section, Clinical Pharmacology of the Muscarinic Receptor-Blocking Drugs). The antimuscarinic drugs have no significant effect on the uterus.

\section*{Sweat Glands}

Atropine suppresses thermoregulatory sweating. Sympathetic cholinergic fibers innervate eccrine sweat glands, and their muscarinic receptors are readily accessible to antimuscarinic drugs. In adults, body temperature is elevated by this effect only if large doses are administered, but in infants and children even ordinary doses may cause "atropine fever."

\section*{Therapeutic Applications}

\section*{CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS}

\section*{Parkinson's Disease}

As described in Chapter 28, the treatment of Parkinson's disease is often an exercise in polypharmacy, since no single agent is fully effective over the course of the disease. Most antimuscarinic drugs promoted for this application (see Table 28-1) were developed before levodopa became available. Their use is accompanied by all of the adverse effects described below, but the drugs remain useful as adjunctive therapy in some patients.

\section*{Motion Sickness}

Certain vestibular disorders respond to antimuscarinic drugs (and to antihistaminic agents with antimuscarinic effects). Scopolamine is one of the oldest remedies for seasickness and is as effective as any more recently introduced agent. It can be given by injection, by mouth, or as a transdermal patch. The patch formulation produces significant blood levels over 48-72 hours. Unfortunately, useful doses by any route usually cause significant sedation and dry mouth.

\section*{OPHTHALMOLOGIC DISORDERS}

Accurate measurement of refractive error in uncooperative patients, eg, young children, requires ciliary paralysis. Also, ophthalmoscopic examination of the retina is greatly facilitated by mydriasis. Therefore,
antimuscarinic agents, administered topically as eye drops or ointment, are very helpful in doing a complete examination. For adults and older children, the shorter-acting drugs are preferred (Table 8-2). For younger children, the greater efficacy of atropine is sometimes necessary, but the possibility of antimuscarinic poisoning is correspondingly increased. Drug loss from the conjunctival sac via the nasolacrimal duct into the nasopharynx can be diminished by the use of the ointment form instead of drops. Formerly, ophthalmic antimuscarinic drugs were selected from the tertiary amine subgroup to ensure good penetration after conjunctival application. Recent experiments in animals, however, suggest that glycopyrrolate, a quaternary agent, is as rapid in onset and as long-lasting as atropine.

Antimuscarinic drugs should never be used for mydriasis unless cycloplegia or prolonged action is required. Alpha-adrenoceptor stimulant drugs, eg, phenylephrine, produce a short-lasting mydriasis that is usually sufficient for funduscopic examination (see Chapter 9).

A second ophthalmologic use is to prevent synechia (adhesion) formation in uveitis and iritis. The longerlasting preparations, especially homatropine, are valuable for this indication.

\section*{RESPIRATORY DISORDERS}

The use of atropine became part of routine preoperative medication when anesthetics such as ether were used, because these irritant anesthetics markedly increased airway secretions and were associated with
frequent episodes of laryngospasm. Preanesthetic injection of atropine or scopolamine could prevent these hazardous effects. Scopolamine also produces significant amnesia for the events associated with surgery and obstetric delivery, a side effect that was considered desirable. On the other hand, urinary retention and intestinal hypomotility following surgery were often exacerbated by antimuscarinic drugs. Newer inhalational anesthetics are far less irritating to the airways.

As described in Chapter 20, the hyperactive neural bronchoconstrictor reflex present in most individuals with asthma is mediated by the vagus, acting on muscarinic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells.
I pratropium (Figure 8-2), a synthetic analog of atropine, is used as an inhalational drug in asthma. The aerosol route of administration has the advantages of maximal concentration at the bronchial target tissue with reduced systemic effects. This application is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 20. I pratropium has also proved useful in COPD, a condition that occurs with higher frequency in older patients, particularly chronic smokers. Patients with COPD benefit from bronchodilators, especially antimuscarinic agents such as ipratropium and the recently approved tiotropium. In contrast to ipratropium, tiotropium has a longer bronchodilator action and can be given once daily. Tiotropium reduces the incidence of COPD exacerbations and is a useful adjunct to pulmonary rehabilitation in increasing exercise tolerance.

\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS}

Marked reflex vagal discharge sometimes accompanies the pain of myocardial infarction (eg, vasovagal attack) and may depress sinoatrial or atrioventricular node function sufficiently to impair cardiac output. Parenteral atropine or a similar antimuscarinic drug is appropriate therapy in this situation. Rare individuals without other detectable cardiac disease have hyperactive carotid sinus reflexes and may experience faintness or even syncope as a result of vagal discharge in response to pressure on the neck, eg, from a tight collar. Such individuals may benefit from the judicious use of atropine or a related antimuscarinic agent.

Pathophysiology can influence muscarinic activity in other ways as well. Circulating autoantibodies against the second extracellular loop of cardiac muscarinic receptors have been detected in some patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. These antibodies exert parasympathomimetic actions on the heart that are prevented by atropine. Although their role in the pathology of heart failure is unknown, they should provide clues to the molecular basis of receptor activation.

\section*{GASTROI NTESTI NAL DISORDERS}

Antimuscarinic agents are now rarely used for peptic ulcer disease in the USA (see Chapter 63). Antimuscarinic agents can provide some relief in the treatment of common traveler's diarrhea and other mild or self-limited conditions of hypermotility. They are often combined with an opioid antidiarrheal drug, an extremely effective therapy. In this combination, however, the very low dosage of the antimuscarinic drug functions primarily to discourage abuse of the opioid agent. The classic combination of atropine with diphenoxylate, a nonanalgesic congener of meperidine, is available under many names (eg, Lomotil) in both tablet and liquid form (see Chapter 63).

\section*{URINARY DISORDERS}
