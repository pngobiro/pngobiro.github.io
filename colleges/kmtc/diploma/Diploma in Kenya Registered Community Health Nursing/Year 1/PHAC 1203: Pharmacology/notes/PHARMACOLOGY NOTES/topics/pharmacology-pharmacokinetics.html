No need of energy e.g. highly lipid soluble drugs. ii) Filtration: Is the process by which water soluble drug of relatively low molecular weight crosses the plasma membrane through pores as a result of hydrodynamic pressure gradient across the membrane e.g. urea and ethylene glycol.</p>
                        <p>(b)i) Facilitated diffusion: It means the passage of drug across the biological membrane along the concentration gradient by the protein carrier mediated system also called as carrier mediated diffusion. It depends on number of carrier e.g. tetracycline, pyrimidine.</p>
                        <p>ii) Active transport: The process by which drugs pass across the biological membrane most often against their concentration gradient with the help of carriers along with the expenditure of energy e.g. alpha methyl dopa, levodopa, 5-fluoro-uracil, 5 bromouracil.</p>
                        <p>iii) Endocytosis: It is the process by which the large molecules are engulfed by the cell membrane and releases them intracellularly e.g. protein, toxins (botulinum, diphtheria)</p>

In case of intravenous or Intra-arterial administration the drug bypasses absorption processes and it enters into the Circulation directly.</p>

                         <p>It is the rate and amount of drug that is absorbed from a given dosage form and reaches the Systemic circulation following non-vascular administration. When the drug is given IV, the Bioavailability is <span class="math-inline">$100\%$</span>. It is important to know the manner in which a drug is absorbed. The Route of administration largely determines the latent period between administration and onset of action. However, drugs are often administered by other routes, such as orally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, rectally, sublingually, or directly into desired sites of action. With these other routes, the amount of drug actually entering the systemic circulation may be less than with the intravenous route.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">i) Blood flow</h4>
                         <p>The rate of blood flow to the tissue capillaries varies widely as a result of the unequal distribution of cardiac output to the various organs.</p>
                        <p>Blood flow to the brain, liver, and kidney is greater than that to the skeletal muscles; adipose tissue has a still lower rate of blood flow.</p>
                        <p>This differential blood flow partly explains the short duration of hypnosis produced by a bolus IV injection of thiopental.</p>
                        <p>The high blood flow, together with the superior lipid solubility of thiopental, permit it to rapidly move into the central nervous system (CNS) and produce anesthesia. Slower distribution to skeletal muscle and adipose tissue lowers the plasma concentration sufficiently so that the higher concentrations within the CNS decrease, and consciousness is regained.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">ii) Capillary permeability</h4>
                        <p>Capillary permeability is determined by capillary structure and by the chemical nature of the drug.</p>
                        <p>Capillary structure: Capillary structure varies widely in terms of the fraction of the basement membrane that is exposed by slit junctions between endothelial cells. In the brain, the capillary structure is continuous, and there are no slit junctions.</p>
                        <p>This contrasts with the liver and spleen, where a large part of the basement membrane is exposed due to large, discontinuous capillaries through which large plasma proteins can pass.</p>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Blood-brain barrier:</h5>
                        <p>To enter the brain, drugs must pass through the endothelial cells of the capillaries of the CNS or be actively transported. For example, a specific transporter for the large neutral amino acid transporter carries levodopa into the brain.</p>
                        <p>By contrast, lipid-soluble drugs readily penetrate into the CNS because they can dissolve in the membrane of the endothelial cells.</p>
                        <p>Ionized or polar drugs generally fail to enter the CNS because they are unable to pass through the endothelial cells of the CNS, which have no slit junctions. These tightly juxtaposed cells form tight junctions that constitute the so-called blood-brain barrier.</p>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Drug structure:</h5>
                         <p>The chemical nature of a drug strongly influences its ability to cross cell membranes. Hydrophobic drugs, which have a uniform distribution of electrons and no net charge, readily move across most biologic membranes.</p>
                        <p>These drugs can dissolve in the lipid membranes and, therefore, permeate the entire cell's surface.</p>
                        <p>The major factor influencing the hydrophobic drug's distribution is the blood flow to the area. By contrast, hydrophilic drugs, which have either a nonuniform distribution of electrons or a positive or negative charge, do not readily penetrate cell membranes, and therefore, must go through the slit junctions.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">iii) Binding of drugs to plasma proteins</h4>
                        <p>Reversible binding to plasma proteins sequesters drugs in a nondiffusible form and slows their transfer out of the vascular compartment.</p>
                        <p>Binding is relatively nonselective as to chemical structure and takes place at sites on the protein to which endogenous compounds, such as bilirubin, normally attach.</p>
                        <p>Plasma albumin is the major drug-binding protein and may act as a drug reservoir; that is, as the concentration of the free drug decreases due to elimination by metabolism or excretion, the bound drug dissociates from the protein. This maintains the free-drug concentration as a constant fraction of the total drug in the plasma.</p>

                         <p>When a drug is administered orally, a part of the drug is not absorbed and excreted in the faeces. The drugs which do not undergo enterohepatic cycle after excretion into the bile are subsequently passed with stool e.g. aluminium hydroxide changes the stool into white colour, ferrous sulfate changes the stool into black and rifampicin into orange red.</p>
                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">d) Pulmonary excretion:</h4>
                         <p>Drugs that are readily vaporized, such as many inhalation anaesthetics and alcohols are excreted through lungs. The rate of drug excretion through lung depends on the volume of air exchange, depth of respiration, rate of pulmonary blood flow and the drug concentration gradient.</p>
                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">e) Sweat:</h4>
                         <p>A number of drugs are excreted into the sweat either by simple diffusion or active secretion e.g. rifampicin, metalloids like arsenic and other heavy metals.</p>
                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">f) Mammary excretion:</h4>
                         <p>Many drugs mostly weak basic drugs are accumulated into the milk. Therefore lactating mothers should be cautious about the intake of these drugs because they may enter into baby through breast milk and produce harmful effects in the baby e.g. ampicillin, aspirin, chlordiazepoxide, coffee, diazepam, furosemide, morphine, streptomycin etc.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Half-life:</h3>
                        <p>Def: Half-life <span class="math-inline">$(t_{1/2})$</span> of a drug is the time taken for the concentration of drug in the blood or plasma to decline to half of original value or the amount of drug in the body to be reduced by <span class="math-inline">$50\%$</span>.</p>
                        <p>It has two phases:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">i.</span>
                                <span class="item-text">half-life of distribution</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">ii.</span>
                                <span class="item-text">Half-life of elimination.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A half-life value can be readily determined for most drugs by administering a dose of the drug to a subject, taking blood samples at various time intervals and then assaying the samples., For example if a blood level of drug A is <span class="math-inline">$8.6 \mathrm{mg/ml}$</span> at 10 minutes and <span class="math-inline">$4.3 \mathrm{mg/ml}$</span> at 60 minutes, so the half - life of that drug is 50 minutes.</p>
