                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Cardiac glycosides</strong> are a class of drugs derived from plants, known for their potent effects on the heart. Digoxin (Lanoxin) is the primary cardiac glycoside used clinically. Key aspects of cardiac glycosides include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Source: Plant alkaloids, derived from plants like digitalis (foxglove).</li>
                        <li>Mechanism of Action: Cardiac glycosides have complex effects on heart muscle, leading to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Increased Myocardial Contractions: They increase the force of myocardial contractions (positive inotropic effect), making each heartbeat stronger and improving cardiac output. This enhances blood supply to all organs, including the kidneys, which leads to diuresis and reduces edema.</li>
                                <li>Decreased Heart Rate: They decrease heart rate (negative chronotropic effect) by increasing parasympathetic tone and decreasing sympathetic tone, which helps in conditions like atrial fibrillation and flutter to slow down rapid heart rhythms.</li>
                                <li>Cellular Level Action: Increase the contractility of the heart muscle by minimizing the movement of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions and increasing the release of calcium (Ca++) ions in the myocardial cells. This enhanced calcium availability boosts muscle contraction force.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Therapeutic Results: Clinical outcomes of cardiac glycoside therapy include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Reduced venous pressure.</li>
                                <li>Coronary dilatation.</li>
                                <li>Reduce heart size.</li>
                                <li>Marked diuresis and decreasing edema.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Cardiac glycosides are potent drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, making toxicity a significant concern. Side effects include:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Side effects:
1. They are extremely toxic and may cause death.
2. There is a narrow margin of safety between the therapeutic dose and
the toxic dose.
3. Could cause overdose by cumulative effects of the drug so frequent
assessment of the serum level is essential.
4. May cause cardiac arrhythmia such as bradycardia (below than 60
beat /minute) and other dysarrhythmia.
5. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
6. Headache, malaise and muscle weakness.
7. Skin rashes, blurring of vision, diplopia and while halos.
ÔÇß Note:
ÔÇß Patients suffering from digitalis intoxication should be admitted to
the ICU for continuous monitoring of ECG. Administration of
digitalis should be halted.
ÔÇß If serum potassium is below normal, administer K salts and give
antiarrhythmic drugs as Lidocain as ordered by Dr.
ÔÇß Drug interactions:
1. Antacid (they decrease the effect of digitalis).
2. Fursemide (Lasix): it increase K loss and increase the chance for
digitalis toxicity.
95
ÔÇß Predisposing factors for digitalis toxicity:
1. K loss (hypokalemia) which results from: diuretics, NPO, gastric
suction, and poor K intake.
2. Pathological conditions;
A) Liver disease: they decrease metabolism and therefore increase
digitalis level.
B) Kidney disease: they decrease the excretion of drug and therefore
increase digitalis levels.
ÔÇß Nursing considerations:
ÔÇß Check doctor‚Äôs order, medication record and bottle label accurately.
ÔÇß Observe monitor for evidence of bradycardia or arrhythmia.

ÔÇß Measure intake and output accurately.
ÔÇß Weigh the patient in daily basis.
ÔÇß Pulse should be checked by 2 nurses.
ÔÇß Provide the client with foods high in potassium as banana, orange.
ÔÇß Monitor serum digoxin level.
ÔÇß Elderly people should be assessed for early signs of toxicity.
ÔÇß Have digoxin antidote available (digoxin immune FAB).
ÔÇß Drugs:

ÔÅ∂ÔÄ†Calcium channel blocking agents:
- Action: for contraction of cardiac and smooth muscle to occur,
extracellular calcium must move into the cell through openings called
calcium channels. These agents inhibit the influx of calcium through the
cell membrane resulting in a depression of automatically and conduction
velocity in both smooth and cardiac muscles leading to:
1. Myocardial contractility. .
