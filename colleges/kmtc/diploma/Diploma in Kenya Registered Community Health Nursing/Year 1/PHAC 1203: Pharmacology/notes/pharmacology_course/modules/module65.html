                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                            <p><strong>Five Major Physiological Effects of Adrenergic Drugs and Their Therapeutic Uses:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Cardiovascular Effects: Increased Heart Rate and Contractility
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Physiological Effect: Stimulation of β1-adrenergic receptors in the heart increases heart rate and force of contraction, enhancing cardiac output.</li>
                                        <li>Therapeutic Use: Cardiogenic Shock. In cardiogenic shock, where the heart's ability to pump blood is severely compromised, adrenergic drugs like dobutamine (β1-agonist) are used to increase cardiac output and improve tissue perfusion, helping to stabilize blood pressure and organ function.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Vascular Effects: Vasoconstriction
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Physiological Effect: Stimulation of α1-adrenergic receptors causes vasoconstriction, particularly in peripheral blood vessels, leading to increased blood pressure.</li>
                                        <li>Therapeutic Use: Hypotension. In patients with severe hypotension or shock, adrenergic drugs like norepinephrine (α-agonist) are used to raise blood pressure by constricting blood vessels, thereby improving venous return and systemic vascular resistance.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Respiratory Effects: Bronchodilation
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Physiological Effect: Stimulation of β2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle causes bronchodilation, widening air passages and improving airflow.</li>
                                        <li>Therapeutic Use: Bronchial Asthma. In acute asthma exacerbations or chronic asthma management, β2-agonists like albuterol are used via inhalation to relax bronchial muscles, open airways, and relieve bronchospasm, facilitating easier breathing.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Ocular Effects: Pupillary Dilation (Mydriasis)
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Physiological Effect: Stimulation of α1-adrenergic receptors in the iris dilator muscle causes the pupil to dilate (mydriasis).</li>
                                        <li>Therapeutic Use: Ophthalmic Examinations. During eye examinations, adrenergic drugs like phenylephrine eye drops are used to dilate pupils, allowing ophthalmologists to get a better view of the retina and optic disc for diagnostic purposes.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Metabolic Effects: Increased Blood Glucose Levels (Hyperglycemia)
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Physiological Effect: Stimulation of β2-adrenergic receptors promotes glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver, increasing the release of glucose into the bloodstream.</li>
                                        <li>Therapeutic Use: Hypoglycemia (Indirect Use). While not a primary use, the hyperglycemic effect of adrenergic drugs can be utilized indirectly in severe hypoglycemia management. In emergency situations of severe hypoglycemia, epinephrine (mixed α and β agonist) can be administered to increase blood glucose levels by promoting glucose release from liver glycogen stores, acting as a counter-regulatory hormone to insulin.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                        <li>Adrenergic drugs increase cardiac output primarily by:
                            <br> a) Causing vasodilation <br> b) Increasing heart rate and contractility <br> c) Reducing blood volume</li>
                        <li>The decongestant effect of adrenergic drugs is mainly due to:
                            <br> a) Bronchodilation <br> b) Vasoconstriction in nasal mucosa <br> c) Reduced mucus secretion</li>
                        <li>In the lungs, adrenergic drugs cause:
                            <br> a) Bronchoconstriction <br> b) Bronchodilation <br> c) Increased mucus production</li>
