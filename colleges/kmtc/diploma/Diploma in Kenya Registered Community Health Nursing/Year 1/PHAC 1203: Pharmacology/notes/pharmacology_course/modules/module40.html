                    <p><strong>Antifibrinolytic agents</strong>, in contrast to thrombolytics, promote clot stability and prevent excessive bleeding by inhibiting fibrinolysis—the process that dissolves blood clots. These agents are valuable in managing conditions characterized by excessive bleeding or when clot stabilization is needed.</p>

                                <li>Mechanism of Action: Antifibrinolytics work by inhibiting the activation of plasminogen to plasmin, or by directly inhibiting plasmin, the enzyme that breaks down fibrin clots. This action helps to stabilize blood clots and reduce bleeding.</li>

lack a clotting factor)
Contraindications: pregnancy, breast feeding, history of thromboembolic
disease, kidney problems, bleeding disorders, and menstrual bleeding.
Side-effects: Nausea, vomiting, Diarrhea
Nursing considerations:
1. To overcome GI problems, instruct patient to eat little and often, and
eat simple foods such as dry toast.
2. Teach patient to drink plenty of fluids.
3. Watch for thrombus or embolus formation
4. Teach patient to report sudden slurred speech, loss of co-ordination,
pain in the chest or groin or leg you should contact a doctor as soon as
possible. If any of these occur, stop taking the medication and see
your doctor.

Cardiac drugs
Cardiac glycosides
 Digitoxins are plant alkaloids.
 They increase myocardial contractions, which will increase blood
supply to all organs including the kidneys therefore causing diuresis,
which will decrease the edema.
 They are used to treat cardiac arrhythmia because they decrease heart
rate.
 Action:
 They increase the force of myocardial contractions (positive
inotropic).
 They increase the contractility of the heart muscle by minimizing the
movement of Na and K ions and increasing the release of Ca ions in
the myocardial cells.
 It decreases the heart rate due to increase in parasympathetic nervous
system and decrease in the sympathetic tone.
 They are primarily excreted through the kidneys.
 The initial dose is the larger dose (the loading or digitalizing dose),
the subsequent doses are referred to as (Maintenance doses).
 Results:
 Decrease in venous pressure.
 Coronary dilatation.
 Reduce heart size.
 Marked diuresis and decreasing edema.
 Indications:
1. Congestive heart failure (C.H.F).

94
2. Cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and sinus
tachycardia.
 Contraindication:
1. Hypersensitivity.
2. Angina pectoris in absence of CHF.
3. Given with caution for elderly and people who have kidney failure.
 Side effects:
1. They are extremely toxic and may cause death.
2. There is a narrow margin of safety between the therapeutic dose and
the toxic dose.
3. Could cause overdose by cumulative effects of the drug so frequent
assessment of the serum level is essential.
4. May cause cardiac arrhythmia such as bradycardia (below than 60
beat /minute) and other dysarrhythmia.
5. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
6. Headache, malaise and muscle weakness.
7. Skin rashes, blurring of vision, diplopia and while halos.
 Note:
 Patients suffering from digitalis intoxication should be admitted to
the ICU for continuous monitoring of ECG. Administration of
digitalis should be halted.
 If serum potassium is below normal, administer K salts and give
antiarrhythmic drugs as Lidocain as ordered by Dr.
 Drug interactions:
1. Antacid (they decrease the effect of digitalis).
2. Fursemide (Lasix): it increase K loss and increase the chance for
digitalis toxicity.
95
 Predisposing factors for digitalis toxicity:
1. K loss (hypokalemia) which results from: diuretics, NPO, gastric
suction, and poor K intake.
2. Pathological conditions;
A) Liver disease: they decrease metabolism and therefore increase
digitalis level.
B) Kidney disease: they decrease the excretion of drug and therefore
increase digitalis levels.
 Nursing considerations:
 Check doctor’s order, medication record and bottle label accurately.
 Observe monitor for evidence of bradycardia or arrhythmia.

 Measure intake and output accurately.
 Weigh the patient in daily basis.
 Pulse should be checked by 2 nurses.
 Provide the client with foods high in potassium as banana, orange.
 Monitor serum digoxin level.
 Elderly people should be assessed for early signs of toxicity.
 Have digoxin antidote available (digoxin immune FAB).
 Drugs:
Digoxin: Lanoxin
Class: cardiac glycoside.
It is the drug of choice for CHF because of:
1. It has rapid onset.
2. It has short duration.

Coronary vasodilators
1. Antianginal drugs
Angina pectoris: is a clinical syndrome characterized by paroxysm of
pain in the anterior chest caused by insufficient coronary blood flow
and/or inadequate oxygen supply to the myocardial muscle.

1. Nitrates/nitrites.
2. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents.
3. Calcium channel blocking agents.
Nitrates/nitrites:
- Nitrates/nitrites - Action: direct relaxation of blood vessels and smooth
muscles vasodialtion O2 requirements.
- relaxation of smooth muscles of coronary arteries coronary
vasodialtion blood supply to the myocardium.
- relaxation of arteries and veins BP workload
in the heart.
Indications:
