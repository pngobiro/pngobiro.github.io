                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Prescription:</strong> Medicating a patient typically begins with a prescription, which is a legal document that communicates a medication order from a licensed prescriber to a pharmacist. This authorization is essential for dispensing and administering medications. Key aspects of a prescription include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Legal Authorization: It's an order for medication authorized by a legal prescriber, such as a licensed physician, dentist, or veterinarian.</li>
                        <li>Pharmacist Guidance: It provides the pharmacist with directions for dispensing the medication to the patient.</li>
                        <li>Patient Safety: Ensures that medications are appropriately prescribed and dispensed, contributing to patient safety.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>üìö Parts of a Prescription</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>A complete prescription typically consists of four main parts:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>1. The superscription:</strong> This is the beginning section of the prescription and includes:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Patient‚Äôs name and address</li>
                                <li>Date the prescription is written</li>
                                <li>The symbol Rx (Latin for "recipe" or "take thou")</li>
                                <li>Age of an infant or child, if applicable, to help the pharmacist verify the dose's correctness.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>2. The inscription:</strong> This part contains the medication details:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Name of the drug (generic or trade name)</li>
                                <li>Dosage form (e.g., tablets, capsules, solution)</li>
                                <li>Drug strength or dosage (e.g., 250 mg, 500 mcg)</li>
                                <li>Amount to be dispensed (e.g., number of tablets, volume of liquid).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>3. The subscription:</strong> This section provides directions to the pharmacist, traditionally including instructions for compounding (preparing) the medication. In modern practice, it is usually limited to directions for dispensing:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Instructions for the pharmacist, such as the number of doses to be dispensed (e.g., dispense #30 tablets).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>4. The signature (Signa or Sig):</strong> This contains directions for the patient on how to take the medication:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Abbreviated as "S" or "Sig" on prescriptions.</li>
                                <li>Includes instructions on dosage, frequency, route, and timing of administration (e.g., "Take one tablet twice daily with food").</li>
                                <li>Prescriber‚Äôs signature, indicating legal authorization of the prescription.</li>
                            </ul>
