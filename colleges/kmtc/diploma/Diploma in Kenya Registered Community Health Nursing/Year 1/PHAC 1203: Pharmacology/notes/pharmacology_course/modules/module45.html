                    <p><strong>Antihypertensive drugs</strong> are used to treat hypertension, or high blood pressure, a chronic medical condition in which the arterial blood pressure is elevated. Managing hypertension is crucial to prevent serious cardiovascular complications. Key aspects of hypertension include:</p>

                                        <li>Prevalence: Accounts for about 90-95% of hypertension cases.</li>
                                        <li>Characteristics: Cause is unknown (idiopathic), but it is likely multifactorial, involving genetic and environmental factors.

                        <li><strong>1. Diuretics:</strong> Often the first-line pharmacological treatment for hypertension, especially thiazide diuretics.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Mechanism of Action: Diuretics lower blood pressure primarily by:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Reducing blood volume: Promoting excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, which decreases circulating blood volume.</li>
                                        <li>Decreasing vascular resistance: With long-term use, they also reduce peripheral vascular resistance, possibly by reducing sodium content in vascular smooth muscle and altering responsiveness to vasoconstrictors.</li>

                                <li>Uses: Effective for mild to moderate hypertension, particularly in:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Elderly patients</li>

                                        <li>Decreasing heart rate and contractility: Blocking beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart reduces heart rate and force of contraction, leading to decreased cardiac output and blood pressure.</li>
                                        <li>Reducing renin release: Inhibiting beta-receptors in the kidneys reduces the release of renin, a hormone that leads to angiotensin II and aldosterone production, thereby lowering blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).</li>
                                    </ul>

                            <p><strong>Mechanisms of Action of Diuretics and Beta-Blockers in Lowering Blood Pressure:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Diuretics:</strong> Lower blood pressure primarily by reducing blood volume and peripheral vascular resistance.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Reduced Blood Volume: Diuretics, like thiazides, act on the kidneys to increase the excretion of sodium and water. This reduces the overall fluid volume in the bloodstream, directly lowering blood pressure.</li>
                                        <li>Decreased Peripheral Vascular Resistance: With long-term use, diuretics also cause vasodilation, reducing the resistance in peripheral blood vessels. This is thought to occur due to changes in sodium concentration within vascular smooth muscle and altered responsiveness to vasoconstrictors.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Beta-Blockers:</strong> Lower blood pressure by reducing cardiac output and renin release.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Reduced Cardiac Output: Beta-blockers block beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, which decreases heart rate and the force of heart muscle contraction. This results in a lower volume of blood being pumped out per minute, reducing blood pressure.</li>
                                        <li>Decreased Renin Release: Beta-blockers also block beta-1 receptors in the kidneys, leading to reduced renin secretion. Renin is an enzyme that initiates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure. By reducing renin, beta-blockers decrease the levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone, leading to vasodilation and reduced fluid retention, further lowering blood pressure.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        <li>Elderly Patients: Often effective and well-tolerated in older adults, especially for systolic hypertension.</li>
                                        <li>African American Patients: Generally more effective as monotherapy in African American patients compared to some other antihypertensive classes.</li>
                                        <li>Mild to Moderate Hypertension: Suitable as initial therapy for many patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension.</li>
                                        <li>Edematous Conditions: Beneficial in patients with hypertension and co-existing conditions like edema or heart failure, where fluid reduction is also therapeutically desirable.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                        <li>Younger Patients: Often effective in younger, active patients and those with high-stress lifestyles.</li>
                                        <li>Patients with Angina or Post-MI: Beneficial for patients who have both hypertension and angina pectoris or have had a myocardial infarction (heart attack), as beta-blockers reduce cardiac workload and protect the heart.</li>
                                        <li>Patients with Certain Arrhythmias: Effective in managing hypertension coexisting with certain arrhythmias like tachycardia, as they reduce heart rate.</li>
                                        <li>Patients with Anxiety-Related Hypertension: Can help reduce blood pressure in patients whose hypertension is exacerbated by anxiety or stress due to their sympatholytic effects.</li>

                            <br> a) Increasing heart rate <br> b) Reducing blood volume <br> c) Dilating arteries</li>
                        <li>Beta-blocking agents reduce blood pressure by decreasing:
                            <br> a) Sodium retention <br> b) Heart rate and contractility <br> c) Peripheral vascular resistance</li>
