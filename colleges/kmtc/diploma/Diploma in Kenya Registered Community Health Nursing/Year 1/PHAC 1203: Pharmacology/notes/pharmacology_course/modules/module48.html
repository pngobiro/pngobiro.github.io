                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Centrally acting agents</strong> are antihypertensive drugs that work within the central nervous system (CNS) to lower blood pressure. Methyldopa is a key example of a centrally acting antihypertensive.</p>

                        <h3>Methyldopa: Aldomin</h3>

                                <li>Classification: Antihypertensive, centrally acting antiadrenergic agent.</li>
                                <li>Action: Methyldopa lowers blood pressure by:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Stimulating Central Inhibitory Alpha-Adrenergic Receptors: The active metabolite of methyldopa, alpha-methylnorepinephrine, lowers blood pressure (BP) by stimulating central inhibitory alpha-adrenergic receptors in the brain.</li>
                                        <li>Reduced Sympathetic Outflow: This central action reduces sympathetic outflow from the brainstem to the peripheral cardiovascular system, leading to decreased peripheral vascular resistance and reduced blood pressure.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        <li>Hypertensive crises: Can be used parenterally (IV) to manage hypertensive emergencies, although less common now with newer agents available.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Centrally acting agents like Methyldopa lower BP by reducing sympathetic outflow from the brainstem; Methyldopa is favored in pregnancy hypertension.</li>
                    <li>Methyldopa side effects include drowsiness, hypotension, and liver issues; nursing care involves monitoring mental alertness and liver function.</li>
                    <li>Hydralazine hydrochloride, a direct vasodilator, acts directly on arterioles to reduce peripheral resistance, used in hypertension and emergencies.</li>
                    <li>Hydralazine side effects include reflex tachycardia and orthostatic hypotension; contraindicated in angina pectoris and certain heart conditions.</li>
