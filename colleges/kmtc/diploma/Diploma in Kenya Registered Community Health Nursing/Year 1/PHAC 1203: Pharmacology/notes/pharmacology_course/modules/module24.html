                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)</strong> are common bacterial infections, especially in women. Treatment often involves antimicrobial agents that concentrate in the urinary tract to eradicate bacteria. In addition to antibiotics (like sulfonamides discussed previously), other drugs specifically act as urinary germicides or analgesics to manage UTIs and their symptoms.</p>
                    <p>Urinary germicides are drugs specifically used to treat UTIs by directly killing bacteria or inhibiting their growth within the urinary tract. Urinary analgesics, on the other hand, are used to relieve symptoms associated with UTIs, such as pain and discomfort, but do not treat the infection itself.</p>

                <h2>📚 1- Nalidixic Acid: A Quinolone Urinary Germicide</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Nalidixic Acid</strong> is a quinolone antibiotic, one of the older urinary germicides, primarily effective against gram-negative bacteria in the urinary tract. Key features include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trade names: Negram, Urogram.</li>
                        <li>Class: Urinary germicide, quinolone derivative.</li>
                        <li>Action: Inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis by targeting bacterial DNA gyrase, an enzyme essential for DNA replication and repair. This action is bactericidal.</li>
                        <li>Metabolism and Excretion: Partially metabolized in the liver and rapidly excreted in the urine, achieving high concentrations in the urinary tract.</li>
                        <li>Sensitivity Testing: Sensitivity determination is recommended before use to ensure the infecting bacteria are susceptible.</li>
                        <li>Uses: Primarily for acute and chronic uncomplicated UTIs caused by susceptible gram-negative bacteria.</li>
                        <li>Liver & Kidney Function Tests: Liver and kidney function tests are recommended if used for more than 2 weeks due to potential toxicity.</li>
                        <li>Contraindications: Use with caution in patients with:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Liver disease</li>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Nitrofurantoin</strong> is a urinary antibacterial agent, effective against a broad range of urinary tract pathogens. Key features include:</p>

                        <li>Action: Interferes with bacterial carbohydrate (CHO) metabolism and disrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis. The exact mechanism is complex and not fully understood, but it damages bacterial DNA and ribosomes.</li>
                        <li>Concentration-Dependent Activity: Bacteriostatic at low concentrations and bactericidal at high concentrations.</li>
                        <li>Uses: Primarily for severe UTIs, including pyelonephritis (kidney infection) and cystitis (bladder infection).</li>
