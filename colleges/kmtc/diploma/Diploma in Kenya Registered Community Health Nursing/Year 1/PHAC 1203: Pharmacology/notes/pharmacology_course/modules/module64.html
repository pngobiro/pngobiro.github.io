                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Sympathomimetic drugs</strong>, also known as adrenergic agonists, are a class of medications that mimic the effects of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The SNS is responsible for the "fight or flight" response, preparing the body for action. Adrenergic drugs achieve their effects by interacting with adrenergic receptors, the receptors of the sympathetic nervous system.</p>
