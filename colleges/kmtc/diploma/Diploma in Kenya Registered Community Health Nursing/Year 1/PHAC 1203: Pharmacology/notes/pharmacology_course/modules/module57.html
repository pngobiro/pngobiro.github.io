                    <p><strong>Chronic toxicity</strong> from narcotic analgesics primarily involves the development of dependence and tolerance, which are significant concerns with long-term opioid use. Key aspects of chronic toxicity include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Chronic Dependence: Long-term use of narcotics, even when medically prescribed, can lead to chronic dependence. This is a well-recognized problem not only among illicit drug users but also among patients using narcotics for chronic pain management. Easy access to narcotics for healthcare professionals (physicians, nurses, pharmacists) increases the risk of dependence.</li>
                        <li>Non-Therapeutic Use: Narcotic analgesics are sometimes misused for non-therapeutic purposes, driven by their euphoric effects and addictive potential.</li>

                            <p><strong>Chronic Toxicity Associated with Narcotic Analgesics:</strong> Chronic toxicity primarily manifests as dependence and tolerance, which are significant concerns with long-term use. </p>
                            <p><strong>Chronic Dependence:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Psychological Dependence (Addiction): A psychological drive to take opioids for their euphoric effects or to relieve distress, characterized by compulsive drug-seeking behavior.</li>
                                <li>Physical Dependence: Physiological adaptation to chronic opioid exposure, where the body requires the drug to function normally. Abrupt cessation leads to withdrawal symptoms.</li>
                                <li>Tolerance: Reduced responsiveness to a drug with prolonged use, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect. This necessitates dose escalation over time to maintain pain relief, further increasing dependence risk.</li>

                                                <li>Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps.</li>
