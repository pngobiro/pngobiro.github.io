                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Pharmacology is broadly divided into three main branches:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Pharmacotherapeutics (Clinical Pharmacology):</strong> This branch focuses on the relative effects of drugs in the human system to treat various disorders. It deals with how drugs prescribed by doctors affect human patients in a clinical setting. <br> 
                        ‚Äî <em>"The study of drug action in man."</em></li>
                        <li><strong>Pharmacodynamic:</strong> This branch is concerned with the experimental science pertaining to theories of drug action. It explores the interactions between chemical components of living systems and foreign chemicals, including drugs, that enter a living organism. <br>
                        ‚Äî <em>"What the drug does to the body."</em></li>
                        <li><strong>Pharmacokinetics:</strong> This is the study of a drug‚Äôs alteration as it moves through the body. It examines the fate of a drug, including how it is absorbed, distributed, bound to or localized in tissues, biotransformed, and excreted.</li>
                    </ol>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Pharmacokinetics is concerned with understanding what the body does to the drug. It involves several key processes:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Drug absorption and distribution:</strong> How the drug enters the bloodstream and reaches different parts of the body.</li>
                        <li><strong>Drug plasma concentration:</strong> The amount of drug present in the plasma at any given time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Therapeutic plasma levels:</strong> The desired concentration range of the drug in plasma to achieve therapeutic effects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Concentration of the active drug at the target site:</strong> Ensuring sufficient drug concentration at the intended site of action.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rate of metabolism:</strong> How quickly the drug is broken down by the body.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rate of excretion:</strong> How quickly the drug and its metabolites are removed from the body.</li>
                    </ol>

                <h2>üìö Parameters Affecting Pharmacokinetics</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Several parameters influence pharmacokinetic processes:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Physicochemical nature of the drug:</strong> Properties like lipid solubility significantly affect how drugs are absorbed and distributed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Formulation of the drug:</strong> The drug's formulation (e.g., tablet, capsule, solution) affects its release and absorption.</li>
                        <li><strong>Route of administration:</strong> Different routes (oral, intravenous, intramuscular, etc.) lead to varying absorption patterns and bioavailability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Binding of the drug to plasma and/or tissue (bioavailability):</strong> The extent to which a drug binds to plasma proteins or tissues affects its availability to reach the target site.</li>
                        <li><strong>Individual characteristics of the patient:</strong> Factors such as age, genetics, and health status can alter drug pharmacokinetics.</li>
                        <li><strong>Concomitant diseases:</strong> The presence of other diseases can impact drug metabolism and excretion.</li>
                        <li><strong>Concomitant administration of food or other drugs:</strong> Food and other medications can interact with drug absorption, metabolism, and excretion.</li>

                            <p><strong>Pharmacodynamics</strong> is what the drug does to the body, focusing on the mechanisms of drug action and their biochemical and physiological effects. <strong>Pharmacokinetics</strong>, on the other hand, is what the body does to the drug, concerning its movement through the body (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion).</p>
                            <p>Example of a factor affecting drug absorption: <strong>Lipid solubility</strong>. Drugs that are highly lipid-soluble can more easily cross cell membranes, leading to better absorption compared to drugs that are poorly lipid-soluble.</p>
