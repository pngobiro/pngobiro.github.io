                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Drug Hypersensitivity</strong> refers to a state where a patient shows an extreme sensitivity to a drug's effect. It is characterized by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Exaggerated Pharmacological Effect: The response is an exaggerated form of the drug's usual pharmacological effect, not a qualitatively different reaction like in allergies or idiosyncrasies.</li>
                        <li>Dose-Dependent and Predictable: The effect is dose-dependent, meaning it increases with higher doses, and it's somewhat predictable based on the drug‚Äôs known actions, just more intense.</li>
                        <li>Sensitivity, Not Allergy: It's not an allergic reaction but rather an increased sensitivity to the drug's intended effects, which become excessive or unsafe.</li>

                            <p>Management often involves a simple reduction in drug dosage, which may be sufficient to eliminate the exaggerated effects while maintaining therapeutic benefits.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Drug Toxicity</strong> refers to adverse effects of a drug that occur due to excessive drug levels in the body. It is characterized by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Excessive Dosage: Toxicity typically results from a dosage that exceeds the body's capacity to handle, whether accidental or intentional.</li>
                        <li>Exaggerated Response: It manifests as an exaggerated pharmacological response, often severe and harmful.</li>
                        <li>Potential for Severe Outcomes: Drug toxicity can lead to serious conditions, including respiratory depression, cardiovascular collapse, and death if not promptly recognized and treated.</li>
                        <li>Reversibility with Intervention: If the drug is withdrawn and appropriate treatment is administered, the toxic effects can often be reversed.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>üìö E. General Side Effects</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>General Side Effects</strong> are unpleasant or unwanted reactions to a drug that are not necessarily harmful but can be bothersome to the patient. They are distinct from allergies, idiosyncrasies, and toxicity, often being expected and less severe. Examples include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Dermatologic reactions:</strong> These include skin-related side effects such as:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Pruritus (itching)</li>
                                <li>Urticaria (hives)</li>
                                <li>Alopecia (hair loss)</li>
                                <li>Granulomas (nodules)</li>
                                <li>Rashes</li>
                                <li>Photosensitivity (increased skin reaction to sunlight)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Blood dyscrasias:</strong> In certain individuals, some drugs can affect the bone marrow, leading to insufficient production of blood cells:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Reduced platelets (thrombocytopenia)</li>
                                <li>Reduced red blood cells (anemia)</li>
                                <li>Reduced white blood cells (leukopenia)</li>
                            </ul>

                    <p>Blood dyscrasias can manifest in several specific forms:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Agranulocytosis:</strong> A severe reduction in granulocytes (a type of white blood cell), increasing susceptibility to infection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Aplastic anemia:</strong> Pancytopenia, which is a reduction in all formed elements of the blood (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets).</li>
                        <li><strong>Hemolytic anemia:</strong> Reduced hemoglobin levels due to the lysis (destruction) of red blood cells (RBCs).</li>
                        <li><strong>Thrombocytopenia:</strong> Deficiency in platelets, leading to increased risk of hemorrhage (bleeding).</li>

                                        <li><strong>Toxicity:</strong> Typically severe and potentially life-threatening if untreated, representing an overdose effect.</li>

                                        <li><strong>Hypersensitivity:</strong> Managed by reducing drug dosage to find a therapeutic balance.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Toxicity:</strong> Requires immediate drug withdrawal and supportive/antidotal treatment to reverse the toxic effects.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Side Effects:</strong> Often managed symptomatically, dose adjustment, or by tolerating if mild; sometimes requires switching medication if intolerable.</li>

                                        <li><strong>Hypersensitivity Example:</strong> A patient on a standard dose of a blood pressure medication experiences excessively low blood pressure (hypotension), indicating hypersensitivity to the drug's blood pressure-lowering effect. Management involves dose reduction.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Toxicity Example:</strong> Opioid overdose leading to severe respiratory depression. This is a toxic effect due to excessive opioid levels, requiring naloxone (antidote) and respiratory support.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Side Effect Example:</strong> Dry mouth with antihistamines. This is a common, expected, and usually tolerable side effect that can be managed with supportive measures like increased fluid intake.</li>
