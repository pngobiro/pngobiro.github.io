                            <p><strong>Key Instructions for Patients Prescribed Oral Ferrous Sulfate:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>1. Timing of Administration:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Take on an Empty Stomach: For best absorption, take ferrous sulfate on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals. However, if gastrointestinal upset occurs, it can be taken with food.</li>
                                        <li>Consistent Schedule: Take the medication at the same time(s) each day to maintain a consistent blood level and improve adherence.</li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Take with Vitamin C: Take ferrous sulfate with citrus juices or Vitamin C supplements. Vitamin C significantly enhances iron absorption from the gut.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>3. Minimizing Absorption Interference:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Avoid Certain Foods/Drinks: Do not take iron supplements with milk, tea, coffee, antacids, or calcium supplements. These can significantly decrease iron absorption. If necessary, take these at least 2 hours apart from iron supplements.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>4. Managing Side Effects:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Expect Stool Changes: Inform the patient that their stools will likely become dark or black, which is a normal and harmless side effect of iron supplementation.</li>
                                        <li>Manage Constipation: Increase dietary fiber intake, drink plenty of fluids, and engage in light exercise to help manage constipation, a common side effect. If constipation is severe, discuss stool softeners with their healthcare provider.</li>
                                        <li>Take with Food if Needed: If nausea or stomach upset occurs, it’s okay to take ferrous sulfate with a small amount of food to improve tolerability, even though it may slightly reduce absorption.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                 <li><strong>5. Safety and Storage:</strong>
                                    <ul>

                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                 <li><strong>6. Follow-up:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Regular Check-ups: Emphasize the importance of regular follow-up appointments and blood tests to monitor iron levels and adjust dosage as needed.</li>
