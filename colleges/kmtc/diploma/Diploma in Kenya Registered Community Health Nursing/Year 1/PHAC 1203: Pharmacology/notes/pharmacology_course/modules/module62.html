                    <p><strong>Antirheumatic & Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents (NSAIDs)</strong> are a diverse class of drugs used to treat inflammatory conditions, pain, and fever. They are termed "nonsteroidal" to differentiate them from corticosteroids, which are also anti-inflammatory but have a different mechanism and broader range of side effects. Key aspects of NSAIDs include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Therapeutic Actions: NSAIDs share three primary therapeutic actions:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Analgesic: Reduce pain, particularly pain associated with inflammation.</li>
                                <li>Antipyretic: Reduce fever.</li>
                                <li>Anti-inflammatory: Reduce inflammation.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Mechanism of Action: The therapeutic actions of NSAIDs are primarily attributed to their inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes.</li>
                        <li>COX Inhibition: NSAIDs inhibit cyclo-oxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes, which are essential for the synthesis of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are lipid compounds that mediate pain, inflammation, and fever responses in the body.</li>
                        <li>Therapeutic Effects: By inhibiting COX enzymes and reducing prostaglandin synthesis, NSAIDs effectively:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Reduce joint swelling, pain & morning stiffness in arthritis.</li>
                                <li>Increase the mobility in arthritic patients.</li>
                                <li>Antipyretic action due to decreased production of prostaglandin from the hypothalamus.</li>
                                <li>Having irritating effect on the GIT.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

Nursing considerations:
1. Note any history of allergic responses to aspirin or nonsteroidal 
antiinflammatory agents. {NS.AID.}
2. Note the age of the client.
3. Determine if patient is taking oral hypoglycemic or insulin and
document it.
