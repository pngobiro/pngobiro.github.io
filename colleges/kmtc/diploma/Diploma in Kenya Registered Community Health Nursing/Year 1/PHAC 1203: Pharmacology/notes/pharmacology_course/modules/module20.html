                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Penicillin G Sodium</strong> is a crystalline form of penicillin G intended for injection, known for its rapid onset of action. Key features include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trade names: Crystapen, crystalline penicillin.</li>
                        <li>Note: Differentiated from Penicillin G potassium ‚Äúoral‚Äù + Injection [Benzylpenicillin k], which has different formulations and uses.</li>
                        <li>Trade name for potassium form: Megacillin.</li>
                        <li>Class: Antibiotic, penicillin group.</li>
                        <li>N.B.: Penicillin G, due to its low cost, remains a first-line choice for treating many infections when susceptible organisms are involved. Its rapid onset of action makes it particularly suitable for fulminating (sudden and severe) infections. However, it is destroyed by acid and penicillinase, limiting its oral use and effectiveness against penicillinase-producing bacteria.</li>

                <h2>üìö Nursing Considerations for Penicillin G Sodium</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Administering Penicillin G Sodium and Potassium safely and effectively requires specific nursing considerations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Administration:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Preferred Route: Intramuscular (IM) injection is generally preferred to minimize discomfort. When administering IM, use solutions with concentrations up to 100,000 units/mL to reduce pain at the injection site.</li>
                                <li>Slow IV Infusion: For IV administration, infuse slowly, especially with high doses, to prevent rapid electrolyte shifts and cardiac arrhythmias. Continuous IV infusion is often used for high-dose therapy.</li>
                                <li>Dilution for IV: For IV use, dilute Penicillin G sodium in compatible solutions like sodium chloride or dextrose. Avoid using dextrose saline as diluent unless compatibility is confirmed.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Monitoring:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Monitor Intake and Output (I&O): Essential to assess renal function and fluid balance, especially in high-dose therapy.</li>
                                <li>Monitor for Hyperkalemia: Rapid IV administration can lead to hyperkalemia, especially with Penicillin G potassium. Monitor serum potassium levels, particularly in patients with renal impairment.</li>
                                <li>Assess for Thrombophlebitis: Regularly assess the IV site for signs of thrombophlebitis (pain, redness, swelling) during and after IV infusion.</li>
                                <li>Monitor for Cardiac Arrhythmias: Especially during rapid IV infusion, monitor cardiac rhythm for arrhythmias.</li>
                                <li>Observe for Allergic Reactions: Observe closely for any signs of allergic reactions (rash, urticaria, wheezing, anaphylaxis) after administration.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Storage and Preparation:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Storage: Reconstituted solutions can be stored at room temperature for 24 hours or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, depending on the formulation and manufacturer guidelines.</li>
                                <li>Dilution: Use 1% - 2% lidocaine (without epinephrine) as a diluent for IM injections to decrease pain at the injection site, if not contraindicated.</li>
                                <li>Mixing Precautions: Note that Penicillin G should not be mixed with aminoglycosides in the same IV solution as they are physically and chemically incompatible.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                                        <li><strong>Penicillin G Sodium:</strong> Contains a significant amount of sodium. This can be a concern for patients who need to restrict sodium intake, such as those with heart failure, hypertension, or renal disease.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Penicillin G Potassium:</strong> Contains a significant amount of potassium. This can be problematic for patients with hyperkalemia or renal impairment who are at risk of potassium overload, especially with rapid IV administration or high doses.</li>

                                        <li><strong>Administration:</strong> Both can be given IM or IV. IV administration should be slow for both to minimize risks.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> For both, monitor for allergic reactions, thrombophlebitis at the IV site, and electrolyte imbalances (sodium with Penicillin G Sodium, potassium with Penicillin G Potassium).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Specific Use Case:</strong>
