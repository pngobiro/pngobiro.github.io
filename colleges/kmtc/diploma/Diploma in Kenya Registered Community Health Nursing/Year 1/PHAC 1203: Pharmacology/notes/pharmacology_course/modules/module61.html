                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Acetaminophen</strong>, also known as paracetamol in many countries, is a widely used non-narcotic analgesic and antipyretic. It is effective in reducing fever and relieving mild to moderate pain but has minimal anti-inflammatory properties. Key features of acetaminophen include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trade names: Acamol, Panadol.</li>
                        <li>Class. : Non-narcotic analgesic, antipyretic. It is not classified as an NSAID because it has very weak anti-inflammatory effects.</li>
                        <li>Action: Acetaminophen's mechanisms are not fully understood, but it primarily acts in the central nervous system:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Antipyretic Effect: Reduces fever by acting on the hypothalamus, leading to peripheral vasodilation & sweating.</li>
                                <li>It also inhibits the effect of pyrogens on the heat-regulating center on the hypothalamus.</li>
                                <li>Analgesic Effect: It may cause analgesia by inhibiting CNS prostaglandin syntheses So it has no anti-inflammatory effect . </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>N.B.: It doesnâ€™t manifest any anticoagulant effect or any ulceration of GIT.</li>
                    </ul>

                                <li>To reduce fever due to bacterial & viral infection .</li>
                                <li>As a substitute for aspirin when contraindicated.
Contraindications: renal insufficiency, anemia.
Side effects:
- Chronic & even acute toxicity can occur after long symptom-free usage.
- Heamolytic anemia, neutrtopnea, thrombocytopnea
- Skin rashes, fever, jaundice, hypoglycemia.
Symptoms of over dosage:
Hepatic toxicity general malaise, nausea, vomiting, fever, and
vascular collapse, delirium, depression, seizures, coma & death.
Treatment of overdose:
1- Induction of emesis.
2- Gastric lavage.
3- Activated charcoal.
4- Oral N-acetyleystine (mucomyst) is said to reduce or prevent hepatic
damage by inactivating acetaminophen metabolites which cause liver
effects.
Dose: Tab. 500 mg Q 4 hrs or up to 1g Q 6 hrs.
Nursing considerations:
1- Suppositories should be stored below 27Âº C .
2- Liver function studies for long term therapy.
3- Have mucomyst available for signs of toxicity.
4- Teach patient signs of toxicity to be reported immediately.

Antirheumatic & Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents
Action:
As in aspirin, the therapeutic actions of these substances are believed to
result from the inhibition of the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase which results
in decreased prostaglandin synthesis so it is effective in:
ïƒ˜ï€ Reducing joint swelling, pain & morning stiffness.
ïƒ˜ï€ Increasing the mobility in arthritic patients.
ïƒ˜ï€ Antipyretic action due to decreased production of prostaglandin
from the hypothalamus.
ïƒ˜ï€ Having irritating effect on the GIT.
Uses :
ïƒ˜ï€ Rheumatoid arthritis
ïƒ˜ï€ Osteorthritis.
ïƒ˜ï€ Gout
ïƒ˜ï€ Other muscloskletal diseases.
ïƒ˜ï€ Dental pain
ïƒ˜ï€ Strains & sprains.
Contraindications:
1- Children less than14 years of age.
