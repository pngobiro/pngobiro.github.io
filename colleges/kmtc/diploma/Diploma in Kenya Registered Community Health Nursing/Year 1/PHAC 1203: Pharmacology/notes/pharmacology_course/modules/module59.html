                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Non-narcotic Analgesics & Antipyretics</strong> are a class of medications used to relieve mild to moderate pain and reduce fever. Unlike narcotic analgesics (opioids), they are not associated with dependence and respiratory depression at typical doses, and are available over-the-counter (OTC) in many countries. However, improper use can still lead to significant side effects and toxicity. Key aspects of non-narcotic analgesics and antipyretics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accessibility and Use: Widely available without prescription, making them commonly used for self-medication for pain and fever.</li>
                        <li>Overdose Risk: Despite being OTC, overdose, especially in children, is a concern due to easy access and potential for accidental ingestion. Overuse or misuse can lead to serious health consequences.</li>
                        <li>Classes: Major classes include:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Salicylates: Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) is the primary example.</li>
                                <li>Para-aminophenol derivatives: Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) is the main drug in this class.</li>
                                <li>Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): A large group including ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, etc., which share analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties but are distinct from salicylates and acetaminophen.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Acetylsalicylic Acid (Aspirin)</strong> is a salicylate and a prototype of non-narcotic analgesics, known for its analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and antiplatelet properties. Key features include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trade name: Aspirin.</li>
                        <li>Classification: Non-narcotic analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, antirhumatic, antiplatelet, NSAID.</li>
                        <li>Action: Aspirin's multiple therapeutic effects stem from its inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are crucial for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Antipyretic Effect: Reduces fever by acting on the hypothalamus, the body's temperature-regulating center. It promotes heat loss by vasodilation of peripheral blood vessels & promoting sweating.</li>
                                <li>The anti-inflammatory effects probably by decreasing prostaglandin synthesis & other mediators of the pain response.</li>
                                <li>The analgesic action is not fully known but may be due to improvement of the inflammatory condition .</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>N.B. : Aspirin also produces inhibition of platelet aggregation.</li>
                    </ul>
