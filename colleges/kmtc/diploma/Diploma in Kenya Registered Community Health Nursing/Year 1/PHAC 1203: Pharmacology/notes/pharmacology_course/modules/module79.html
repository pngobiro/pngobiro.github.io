                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Antithyroid drugs</strong> are used to treat hyperthyroidism, a condition of excessive thyroid hormone production. These drugs help to reduce thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion, thereby alleviating symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Key aspects of antithyroid drugs include:</p>

                        <h3>Action of Antithyroid Drugs:</h3>
                        <div class="content-block">
                            <ul>
                                <li>Inhibit Thyroid Hormone Production: Anti-thyroid drugs work by inhibiting one or more steps in the synthesis of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) within the thyroid gland.</li>
                                <li>Types of Antithyroid Drugs: Major categories include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Thiourea derivatives: such as methimazole (Tapazole) and propylthiouracil (PTU), which are commonly used antithyroid medications.</li>
                                        <li>Large doses of iodide: which can temporarily inhibit thyroid hormone release (used in specific situations like thyroid storm or before thyroid surgery).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                        <h3>Action Mechanism:</h3>
                        <div class="content-block">
                            <ul>
                                <li>Inhibition of Thyroid Hormone Synthesis: Anti-thyroid drugs, particularly thioamides like methimazole and propylthiouracil, primarily inhibit thyroid peroxidase (TPO), an enzyme crucial in several steps of thyroid hormone synthesis. This includes:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Inhibition of Iodination: Blocking the iodination of tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin, a precursor protein needed to form thyroid hormones.</li>
                                        <li>Blocking Coupling: Preventing the coupling of iodotyrosines (MIT and DIT) to form T3 and T4.</li>
                                        <li>Propylthiouracil (PTU) also inhibits the peripheral conversion of T4 to the more active T3 in peripheral tissues, adding to its antithyroid effect. Methimazole does not have this peripheral conversion inhibitory effect.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Reduction of Hormone Levels: By inhibiting these steps, antithyroid drugs reduce the overall production and levels of thyroid hormones, helping to control hyperthyroidism.</li>

                                <li>Potency: Methimazole (Tapazole) is about 10 times stronger than propylthiouracil (PTU), making it a more potent inhibitor of thyroid hormone synthesis.</li>

                                <li>Additional Action: Propylthiouracil (PTU) has a dual mechanism of action, not only does it inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis in the thyroid gland, but it also inhibits the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. This additional action can be clinically relevant in certain situations, such as thyroid storm, where rapid reduction of T3 levels is particularly beneficial.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Potency:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Methimazole (Tapazole): Approximately 10 times more potent than Propylthiouracil (PTU) in inhibiting thyroid hormone synthesis. This means lower doses of methimazole are needed to achieve the same therapeutic effect as higher doses of PTU.</li>
                                        <li>Propylthiouracil (PTU): Less potent than methimazole, requiring higher doses to achieve comparable thyroid hormone synthesis inhibition.</li>

                                </li>
                                <li>Mechanisms of Action:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Shared Mechanism (Both Methimazole and PTU): Both drugs primarily inhibit thyroid peroxidase (TPO), an enzyme crucial for the iodination of tyrosine residues and the coupling of iodotyrosines, both essential steps in the synthesis of T3 and T4 within the thyroid gland. This is the major mechanism by which both drugs reduce thyroid hormone production.</li>
                                        <li>Unique Mechanism of PTU: Propylthiouracil (PTU) has an additional mechanism of action that methimazole lacks:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Inhibition of Peripheral T4 to T3 Conversion: PTU inhibits the enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase, which is responsible for the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues (outside the thyroid gland). T3 is the more active form of thyroid hormone. By blocking this conversion, PTU can more rapidly lower the levels of the active hormone T3 in the body, in addition to reducing overall thyroid hormone synthesis. Methimazole does not significantly inhibit this peripheral conversion.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Clinical Situations Favoring PTU over Methimazole: Despite being less potent, PTU is preferred over methimazole in certain specific clinical situations due to its unique dual mechanism of action:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>First Trimester of Pregnancy: PTU is generally preferred over methimazole during the first trimester of pregnancy. Although both drugs cross the placenta, PTU is thought to have a lower risk of causing certain birth defects (embryopathy) compared to methimazole, particularly aplasia cutis. However, this recommendation is nuanced and clinical guidelines may vary, with some recent guidelines suggesting methimazole is also acceptable even in the first trimester in certain situations due to PTU's higher risk of liver toxicity.</li>
                                        <li>Thyroid Storm (Thyrotoxic Crisis): PTU is often favored in the treatment of thyroid storm, a severe, life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism. In thyroid storm, the additional action of PTU in inhibiting peripheral T4 to T3 conversion can be clinically advantageous for more rapidly reducing the levels of the active thyroid hormone T3, helping to control the acute crisis more effectively. While methimazole is more potent in reducing thyroid hormone synthesis, its lack of effect on peripheral T4 to T3 conversion makes PTU theoretically more beneficial in rapidly lowering T3 levels in thyroid storm.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
