                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)</strong> are a class of antidepressants that were among the first medications used to treat depression. While newer antidepressants like SSRIs and SNRIs are now more commonly prescribed due to fewer side effects, TCAs remain effective for certain conditions. Key aspects of tricyclic antidepressants include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mechanism of Action: TCAs primarily work by:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Blocking Neurotransmitter Reuptake: Preventing the presynaptic re-uptake of neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain. This action increases the concentration of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, enhancing neurotransmission.</li>
                                <li>Mood Elevation: By increasing the availability of norepinephrine and serotonin, TCAs help elevate mood and alleviate symptoms of depression.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Clinical Use: Effective in treating various depressive disorders, and also used for other conditions like chronic pain and nocturnal enuresis.</li>
                    </ul>

                                        <li>Clomipramine is preferred for OCD due to its relatively greater serotonergic activity compared to other TCAs, making it more effective in managing obsessive and compulsive behaviors.</li>
                                        <li>Imipramine is preferred for childhood enuresis due to established efficacy and clinical experience in treating bed-wetting, as well as for general depression management, though less specialized than Clomipramine for OCD.</li>

                                        <li>Shared Tricyclic Antidepressant Side Effects: Both Clomipramine and Imipramine share typical side effects associated with tricyclic antidepressants, including:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Anticholinergic Effects: Dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, urinary retention.</li>
                                                <li>Cardiovascular Effects: Orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, tachycardia, potential for arrhythmias.</li>
                                                <li>Central Nervous System Effects: Drowsiness, sedation, dizziness, cognitive impairment.</li>
                                                <li>Other: Weight gain, sexual dysfunction.</li>

                                        <li>Intensity and Specificity: While both share similar categories of side effects, the intensity and specific manifestation can vary between individuals and may be somewhat drug-dependent. For example, Clomipramine might have a slightly higher propensity for serotonergic side effects due to its greater serotonin reuptake inhibition.</li>
                                </li>
