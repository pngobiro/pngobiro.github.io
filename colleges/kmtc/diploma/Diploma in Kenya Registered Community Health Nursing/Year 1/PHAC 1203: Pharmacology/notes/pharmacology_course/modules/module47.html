                    <p>Let's examine specific examples of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, focusing on Atenolol and Propranolol, to highlight their differences and clinical applications:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Atenolol: Cardioselective Beta-Blocker</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Trade name: Normatin.</li>
                                <li>Classification: Beta-adrenergic blocking agent.</li>
                                <li>Selectivity: Beta 1 -adrenoreceptor blocking drug, which is cardioselective, meaning it primarily blocks Œ≤1 receptors in the heart.</li>
                                <li>Uses:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Hypertension: Effective in managing hypertension, particularly mild to moderate cases.</li>
                                        <li>Angina Pectoris: Used to reduce the frequency and severity of angina attacks.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Dosage: Available in Tablets: 50 mg and 100 mg.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Initial dose: Typically 50 mg daily.</li>
                                        <li>Dosage Adjustment: If there is no adequate response at 50 mg, the dose may be increased to 100 mg daily. Further increases are generally not recommended.</li>
                                        <li>IV Use in Acute MI: In cases of acute myocardial infarction (MI), IV administration may be used initially. Give 5 mg IV over 5 minutes, and if there is no response or adverse effects, another 5 mg dose can be given after 10 minutes.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                        <li>IV Dilution: For IV use, Atenolol may be diluted in sodium chloride, dextrose, or dextrose saline solutions to facilitate slower administration and reduce potential side effects.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Patients with Asthma:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Atenolol: Safer than nonselective beta-blockers but still should be used cautiously as cardioselectivity is not absolute and bronchospasm is still a potential risk, especially at higher doses.</li>
                                                <li>Propranolol: Significantly contraindicated in asthma due to Œ≤2 blockade, which can cause bronchoconstriction and exacerbate asthma symptoms, potentially leading to severe respiratory distress.</li>

                                                <li>Atenolol and Propranolol: Both can mask symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, which is an important warning sign for patients and clinicians. Nonselective beta-blockers like propranolol may be more problematic as they can also inhibit glycogenolysis (glucose release from liver stores) mediated by Œ≤2 receptors, potentially prolonging hypoglycemia and making recovery from hypoglycemic episodes more difficult. Cardioselective agents may be slightly safer but still require caution and patient education about monitoring blood glucose and recognizing other non-adrenergic signs of hypoglycemia (sweating, hunger, confusion).</li>

                    <li>Atenolol (cardioselective Œ≤1-blocker) is used mainly for hypertension and angina, safer for respiratory conditions than nonselective agents.</li>
                    <li>Propranolol (nonselective Œ≤1 and Œ≤2 blocker) treats hypertension, angina, arrhythmias, migraine, and essential tremor; contraindicated in asthma due to bronchoconstriction risk.</li>
                    <li>Dosages for both drugs are individualized; Atenolol starts at 50 mg daily, Propranolol starts at 40 mg BID, with adjustments based on response.</li>
                    <li>Nursing considerations include monitoring heart rate and blood pressure, caution in patients with asthma and diabetes, and educating patients on gradual dose changes and potential side effects.</li>
