                    <ul>
                        <li>Trade names: Bicillin C-R, Duplo-penicillin, procaine benzyl penicillin.</li>

                                <li>Upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., Tonsillitis, pharyngitis)</li>
                                <li>Otitis media (middle ear infection)</li>

                                <li>Penicillin G (potassium or sodium) is inherently rapid in action but short-acting.</li>
                                <li>Procaine penicillin G provides a prolonged action due to slower absorption from the injection site.</li>
                                <li>Benzathine penicillin G provides very prolonged action, lasting for several weeks, due to extremely slow release from the intramuscular depot.</li>

                    <p>Administering Penicillin G, Benzathine, and Procaine combination requires specific nursing considerations to ensure safety and efficacy:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preparation and Administration:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Shake vial vigorously before withdrawing the dose, as it is a suspension and components may settle.</li>
                                <li>Use a 20-gauge needle or larger due to the viscous nature of the suspension. Do not use a smaller gauge needle as it may be difficult to withdraw and inject.</li>
                                <li>Administer IM injection deeply into a large muscle mass, such as the upper outer quadrant of the gluteus maximus (buttock) or the vastus lateralis (thigh) in adults, and vastus lateralis or rectus femoris in children.</li>
                                <li>Inject slowly to minimize pain and tissue damage.</li>
                                <li>Do not massage the injection site after administration as it can affect the rate of absorption.</li>
                                <li>Rotate injection sites if repeated doses are necessary to prevent tissue irritation and lipodystrophy.</li>
                                <li>Do not allow medication to remain in the syringe and needle for extended periods before injection, as it may become plugged or the syringe may "freeze". Administer immediately after drawing up.</li>
                                <li>Before injection, aspirate to ensure the needle is not in a vein. Accidental IV administration can cause severe reactions.</li>

                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Patient Monitoring:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Monitor patients closely for at least 20-30 minutes after injection for any immediate allergic reactions, especially after the first dose.</li>
                                <li>Be prepared to manage anaphylactic reactions, having epinephrine, corticosteroids, oxygen, and antihistamines immediately available.</li>
                                <li>Observe injection site for local reactions like pain, swelling, or redness.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>Instruct patients to report any signs of allergic reaction immediately (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing).</li>
                                <li>Emphasize the importance of completing the full prescribed course of therapy, even if symptoms improve, to prevent recurrence and antibiotic resistance.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Contraindications:

                                <li><strong>Never administer intravenously (IV).</strong> This formulation is for IM use only. IV administration can cause severe cardio-respiratory events and death.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>If a large dose is prescribed and the available muscle mass is small, divide the dose into two separate injection sites to ensure adequate absorption and minimize discomfort.</li>

                            <p><strong>Why IM Administration for Penicillin G Combinations:</strong> Penicillin G, Benzathine, and Procaine combined is formulated for intramuscular (IM) administration because of the specific pharmacokinetic properties of benzathine and procaine penicillin. These forms are designed for slow release from the muscle tissue, providing prolonged therapeutic drug levels. Intravenous (IV) administration of this formulation is contraindicated and extremely dangerous because:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Formulation Properties:</strong> The combination is a suspension, not a solution suitable for IV injection. Injecting a suspension IV can cause embolism, as particulate matter can directly enter the bloodstream.</li>
                                <li><strong>Risk of Cardio-Respiratory Arrest:</strong> IV administration can lead to severe, rapid reactions, including cardio-respiratory arrest and death, due to the rapid and high concentrations of procaine and benzathine entering the systemic circulation, which are intended for slow release.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Critical Steps for Safe IM Administration:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Verify Route:</strong> Double-check that the prescribed route is IM and NEVER IV. Confirm the medication is indeed Penicillin G, Benzathine and Procaine combined and intended for IM use.</li>
                                <li><strong>Prepare Correctly:</strong> Shake the vial vigorously to ensure the suspension is uniformly mixed before drawing up the dose. Use an appropriate gauge needle (20G or larger) for withdrawal and injection due to the suspension's viscosity.</li>
                                <li><strong>Choose Appropriate Site:</strong> Select a large muscle mass, such as the gluteus maximus or vastus lateralis, away from major nerves and blood vessels. In adults, the upper outer quadrant of the buttock or thigh; in children, the thigh is generally preferred.</li>
                                <li><strong>Inject Deeply and Slowly:</strong> Administer the injection deep into the muscle tissue and inject the medication slowly to minimize pain and allow for gradual absorption.</li>
                                <li><strong>Aspirate Before Injecting:</strong> Always aspirate before injecting to ensure the needle is not in a blood vessel. If blood is aspirated, withdraw the needle, change needles, and choose a different injection site.</li>
                                <li><strong>Do Not Massage Site:</strong> Do not massage the injection site after administration to avoid altering the intended slow absorption rate from the depot injection.</li>
                                <li><strong>Monitor Patient Post-Injection:</strong> Observe the patient for at least 20-30 minutes post-injection for any signs of immediate allergic reactions, and ensure emergency equipment is readily available.</li>
