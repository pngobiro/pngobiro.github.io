                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Thyroid & Antithyroid Drugs</strong> are used to manage disorders of the thyroid gland, which produces hormones essential for regulating metabolism, growth, and development. The thyroid gland manufactures two primary hormones: thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), both containing iodine, which are crucial for thyroid function.</p>

                            <p>Diseases involving the thyroid gland typically fall into two categories:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Hypothyroidism (Underactive Thyroid):
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Definition: Characterized by decreased production of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), leading to a metabolic slowdown.</li>
                                        <li>Types:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Cretinism: Hypothyroidism in infancy and early childhood, leading to severe physical and mental developmental delays if untreated.</li>
                                                <li>Myxedema: Hypothyroidism in adults, characterized by decreased metabolic rate, lethargy, weight gain, and altered physical appearance (e.g., facial and eyelid edema, dry skin).</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Causes of Hypothyroidism:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Primary Hypothyroidism: Results from atrophy or destruction of the thyroid gland itself, often due to autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) or iodine deficiency.</li>
                                                <li>Secondary Hypothyroidism: Occurs secondary to hypofunction of the pituitary gland or prolonged administration of antithyroid drugs, which reduce TSH secretion and consequently thyroid hormone production.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>

                                <li>Hyperthyroidism (Overactive Thyroid):
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Definition: Characterized by excessive production of thyroid hormones, leading to an accelerated metabolic rate.</li>
                                        <li>Graves' Disease: The most common cause of hyperthyroidism, an autoimmune disorder where antibodies stimulate the thyroid gland to overproduce hormones. Characterized by symptoms like:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Increased production of thyroid hormones (elevated T3 and T4 levels).</li>
                                                <li>Graves' disease characterized by protruding eyes (exophthalmos) and extreme nervousness, tachycardia, weight loss, and heat intolerance.</li>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Thyroid hormone preparations</strong> are used to treat hypothyroidism by replacing or supplementing endogenous thyroid hormones. Available preparations include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Levothyroxine sodium (T4) (Synthroid):
                            <ul>
                                <li>Description: Synthetic form of thyroxine (T4), the primary hormone secreted by the thyroid gland.</li>
                                <li>Use: Drug of choice for most patients requiring thyroid hormone replacement due to its stability, consistent potency, and conversion to T3 in the body.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Liothyronine sodium (T3) (Cytomel):
                            <ul>
                                <li>Description: Synthetic form of triiodothyronine (T3), the more active thyroid hormone.</li>
                                <li>Use: Used less frequently than levothyroxine, typically in specific situations where rapid onset of action or T3-specific therapy is desired.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Liotrix (Mixture of T4+ T3 ) (Euthroid, Thyrolar):
                            <ul>
                                <li>Description: Synthetic mixture containing both levothyroxine (T4) and liothyronine (T3) in a fixed ratio (usually 4:1 or 10:1 of T4 to T3).</li>
                                <li>Use: Aims to mimic natural thyroid hormone secretion ratio, but offers no clear advantage over T4 monotherapy for most patients and is not routinely preferred.</li>

                                <li>Essential for Development: Thyroid hormones are essential for normal physical and mental development, particularly in the fetus and infants. Crucial for brain development and overall growth.</li>
                                <li>Metabolic Rate Increase: Increase basal metabolic rate (BMR), affecting nearly every organ system. They increase oxygen consumption and heat production, influencing the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.</li>
                                <li>Blood Sugar and Fat Metabolism: Increase blood sugar levels by promoting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Increase synthesis of fatty acids and decrease plasma cholesterol and triglycerides levels, although net effect on lipid profile is complex.</li>
                                <li>Cardiovascular Effects: Increase heart rate and force of contraction, leading to increased cardiac output. Also increase peripheral vasodilation, which can lower peripheral vascular resistance.</li>
                                <li>Hormonal Feedback: Decrease thyroid releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary through negative feedback, regulating thyroid hormone production.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Chemical Nature:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Levothyroxine (T4): Synthetic form of thyroxine, which is the primary hormone secreted by the thyroid gland. It is a prohormone that is converted to T3 in peripheral tissues.</li>
                                        <li>Liothyronine (T3): Synthetic form of triiodothyronine, which is the more active and potent thyroid hormone at the cellular level. T3 is about three to four times more potent than T4.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Onset of Action and Duration of Effect:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Levothyroxine (T4): Slower onset of action (days to weeks) because it needs to be converted to T3 to become fully active. Has a long half-life (about 7 days), providing a stable and sustained thyroid hormone level with once-daily dosing.</li>
                                        <li>Liothyronine (T3): Faster onset of action (within hours) and shorter duration of effect (half-life about 1.5 days). Its rapid action and clearance lead to more fluctuations in hormone levels and may require more frequent dosing.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Primary Clinical Uses:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Levothyroxine (T4): Drug of choice for the vast majority of patients with hypothyroidism. It effectively mimics the body's natural thyroid hormone production process, providing a stable reservoir of thyroid hormone that the body can convert to T3 as needed. Suitable for long-term thyroid replacement therapy.</li>
                                        <li>Liothyronine (T3): Used less frequently and reserved for specific situations:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Short-term TSH Suppression: May be used when rapid and short-term thyroid hormone effect is needed, such as in thyroid cancer patients needing TSH suppression before radioactive iodine scanning.</li>
                                                <li>Severe Myxedema Coma: In severe myxedema coma, where rapid onset of thyroid hormone action is critical, IV liothyronine may be used initially to quickly restore thyroid hormone levels, although IV levothyroxine is also commonly used and effective.</li>
                                                <li>Diagnostic Use: In thyroid function tests to assess thyroid responsiveness.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Why Levothyroxine is Generally Preferred over Liothyronine for Hypothyroidism:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Physiological Mimicry: Levothyroxine (T4) more closely mimics the body's natural thyroid hormone physiology. The body can convert T4 to T3 as needed, providing a more physiological and stable hormone level.</li>
                                        <li>Stable Hormone Levels: Levothyroxine's long half-life allows for once-daily dosing and results in more stable serum thyroid hormone levels, reducing fluctuations and making it easier to manage and monitor therapy.</li>
                                        <li>Safety Profile: Generally considered safer for long-term use with a lower risk of cardiac side effects compared to T3, which can cause more pronounced cardiovascular stimulation due to its potency and rapid action.</li>
                                        <li>Monitoring Ease: Monitoring TSH levels is effective for adjusting levothyroxine dosage. T3 levels are less frequently monitored in routine hypothyroidism management.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
