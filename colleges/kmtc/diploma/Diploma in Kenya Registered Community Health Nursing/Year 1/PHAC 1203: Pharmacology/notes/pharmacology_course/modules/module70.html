                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>1- Brompheniramine Maleate: Ahiston</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Trade name: Ahiston.</li>
                                <li>Class. : Antihistamine, first-generation H1 blocker.</li>
                                <li>Action: Brompheniramine is an H1 receptor antagonist that competes with histamine for H1-receptor sites on effector cells. It is known for:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Antihistaminic Action: Effectively blocks H1 receptors, reducing histamine-mediated symptoms.</li>
                                        <li>Mild Sedative Effect: Compared to other first-generation antihistamines, it has a relatively lower incidence of sedation, although drowsiness can still occur.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                        <li>Children 2-6 years: Use is generally not recommended without medical advice; if used, dosage is lower and carefully determined by a healthcare provider.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                        <li>Antiemetic Effect: Strong antiemetic properties, useful in preventing and treating nausea and vomiting, likely due to its anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects, particularly on the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ).</li>
                                        <li>Sedative Action: Significant sedative properties, often used to promote sleep and reduce anxiety. It is more sedating than many other first-generation antihistamines.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                                <li>Nausea and Vomiting: Highly effective as an antiemetic, especially for motion sickness, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and drug-induced nausea.</li>
                                                <li>Sedation: Used for preoperative and postoperative sedation, and nighttime sedation due to its strong sedative properties.</li>
                                                <li>Severe Allergic Reactions: Can be used for allergic conditions, especially when combined sedative and antihistaminic effects are beneficial, although other antihistamines might be preferred for routine allergy symptoms due to less sedation.</li>

                                        <li>Patients Needing to Remain Alert: For individuals who need to remain alert and functional, such as during work or school, Brompheniramine is a better choice due to less drowsiness.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        <li>Nausea and Vomiting: When antiemetic effect is a primary goal, Promethazine is preferred due to its strong antiemetic properties, effective for motion sickness and chemotherapy-induced nausea.</li>
                                        <li>Sedation is Desired: When sedation is a therapeutic goal, such as preoperative sedation or nighttime sleep aid, Promethazine is more effective due to its potent sedative action.</li>
                                        <li>Severe Allergic Reactions: In severe allergic reactions where combined antihistaminic and sedative effects are beneficial, and when rapid onset and parenteral administration are needed, Promethazine injection can be used.</li>
                                    </ul>
