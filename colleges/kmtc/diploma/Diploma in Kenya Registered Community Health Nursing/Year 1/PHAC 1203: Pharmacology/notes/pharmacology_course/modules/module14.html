                    <p>Safe and effective medication administration requires strict adherence to guidelines to minimize errors and ensure patient safety. These guidelines cover various aspects from preparation to administration and documentation:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>1. Concentrate Fully:</strong> When preparing or administering medications, focus entirely on the task to avoid distractions and errors. Give your whole attention to the process.</li>
                        <li><strong>2. Verify Written Orders:</strong> Always ensure you have a clear, written order from an authorized prescriber for every medication you administer. Verbal orders should be documented and confirmed in writing as soon as possible.</li>
                        <li><strong>3. Read Labels Carefully:</strong> Always read the medication label:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Before taking the medication from storage:</strong> Verify you have the correct medication and strength.</li>
                                <li><strong>While using the medication:</strong> Double-check the label against the medication administration record (MAR) or order.</li>
                                <li><strong>Before returning the drug to its storage location:</strong> Ensure you are putting back the correct medication to prevent mix-ups.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>4. Ensure Clear Labeling:</strong> All medications should be clearly labeled, and labels must be legible. If a label is unclear, illegible, or damaged, the medication should not be used.</li>
                        <li><strong>5. Never Use Unlabeled Medications:</strong> Never administer any medication from an unlabeled container. If a container is unlabeled, discard it according to institutional policy.</li>
                        <li><strong>6. Avoid Transferring Medications to Different Containers:</strong> Never transfer a drug into a bottle or container with a different label. For example, if you have Keflex and need to transfer it, do not use an empty ampicillin bottle. Always use correctly labeled containers.</li>

                        <li><strong>7. Measure and Calculate Accurately:</strong> Measure quantities and calculate doses precisely as ordered, using appropriate measuring devices and techniques. Double-check calculations, especially for pediatric and high-risk medications.</li>
                        <li><strong>8. Handling Tablets, Capsules, and Pills Properly:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Avoid touching tablets, capsules, or pills with your fingers to prevent contamination and maintain hygiene.</li>
                                <li>Use the cap of the container to guide or pour tablets into the medication cup or directly into the patient's hand (if appropriate and patient is able).</li>
                                <li>For unit-dose packaging, open at the bedside and administer directly without touching the medication.</li>

                        <li><strong>9. Avoid Wastage of Medicine:</strong> Minimize medication wastage. Prepare only the dose required and return any unopened, unused doses to appropriate storage if allowed by policy. However, never return opened or used doses to stock.</li>
                        <li><strong>10. Administer Medications Prepared by Yourself:</strong> Never administer medications prepared by another person. If you did not prepare it, you cannot be certain of its accuracy and integrity. Otherwise, you will bear the responsibility for any mistake.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>1. Read Labels Carefully (Guideline 3):</strong> Always read the medication label three times‚Äîbefore taking from storage, while preparing, and before returning to storage. <br> <strong>Importance:</strong> This triple-check system is crucial for verifying the medication, dose, and patient, preventing medication errors such as administering the wrong drug or dose.</li>
                                <li><strong>2. Handle Tablets, Capsules, and Pills Properly (Guideline 8):</strong> Avoid touching medications with bare hands; use the container cap or unit-dose packaging to dispense. <br> <strong>Importance:</strong> Prevents contamination of medications with germs from hands, maintains medication integrity, and ensures hygienic administration practices.</li>
                                <li><strong>3. Administer Medications Prepared by Yourself (Guideline 10):</strong> Only administer medications that you personally prepared. <br> <strong>Importance:</strong> Ensures accountability and allows you to verify the accuracy of the medication and dosage. Accepting medications prepared by others introduces the risk of errors made during preparation that you are unaware of, for which you would be responsible upon administration.</li>
