                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Nitrates and nitrites are available in several dosage forms, each suited for different clinical scenarios:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Dosage Forms:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Sublingual Tablets: For immediate relief of acute angina attacks. Example: Cordil 5 mg PRN (as needed).</li>
                                <li>Oral Tablets and Capsules: For regular, longer-term prophylaxis against angina. Example: Isotard 20 ‚Äì 40 mg twice a day.</li>
                                <li>Topical Ointments and Patches: For sustained release and prolonged prophylaxis. Topical: available as patches or ointment.</li>
                                <li>Parenteral (IV Infusion): For acute, severe angina or unstable angina requiring immediate and continuous nitrate administration. Parental (IV infusion).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Nursing Considerations:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Administration:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Empty Stomach: Administer medications, especially oral forms, on an empty stomach to enhance absorption, unless GI upset occurs, in which case they can be taken with a light snack.</li>
                                        <li>Sublingual Tablets Handling: Advise patients to carry sublingual tablets in their original glass container, tightly capped, to prevent degradation from light and moisture.</li>
                                        <li>Sublingual Administration Technique: Instruct patients on the proper technique for taking sublingual tablets:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>At the onset of anginal pain, place one tablet under the tongue and let it dissolve completely. Avoid swallowing until fully dissolved to ensure sublingual absorption.</li>
                                                <li>If pain is not relieved within 5 minutes after the first tablet, take a second tablet. If pain persists after a total of 3 tablets taken at 5-minute intervals, seek immediate medical attention in an emergency room. Do not exceed three tablets in 15 minutes without medical supervision.</li>
                                                <li>Take sublingual tablets 5-15 minutes prior to activities likely to induce angina, such as exercise or emotional stress, for prophylactic effect.</li>
                                                <li>Advise taking sublingual tablets while sitting or lying down to avoid postural hypotension and prevent falls due to dizziness.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                <li>Management of Headache: Headache is a common side effect due to vasodilation. Reassure patients that it is usually transient and often diminishes with continued use. Analgesics like acetaminophen may be used to manage headache if needed.</li>
                                <li>Isosorbide Mononitrate for Liver Impairment: Isosorbide mononitrate may be preferred in patients with liver impairments as it undergoes less hepatic metabolism compared to other nitrates.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
