                    <p><strong>Antipsychotic drugs</strong>, also known as neuroleptics or major tranquilizers, are medications primarily used to manage psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (manic phase), and other psychotic conditions. These drugs help to reduce psychotic symptoms and improve patient functioning. Key aspects of antipsychotic drugs include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Therapeutic Goal: To reduce psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and agitation, enabling patients to function better in daily life and improving their quality of life.</li>
                        <li>Classes: Antipsychotics are broadly classified into two main generations:
                            <ol>
                                <li>First-Generation Antipsychotics (FGAs) or Typical Antipsychotics: Primarily dopamine receptor antagonists. Examples include Chlorpromazine and Haloperidol.</li>
                                <li>Second-Generation Antipsychotics (SGAs) or Atypical Antipsychotics: Affect dopamine and serotonin receptors. Examples include Risperidone, Olanzapine, and Quetiapine.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Mechanism of Action: Primarily involve modulation of neurotransmitter activity in the brain, especially dopamine and serotonin systems.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>üìö Chlorpromazine: A Phenothiazine Antipsychotic (Largactil)</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Chlorpromazine (Largactil)</strong> is a first-generation antipsychotic and a prototype of the phenothiazine class. It is used to manage a range of psychiatric and non-psychiatric conditions. Key features include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trade name: Largactil.</li>
                        <li>Class: Antipsychotic, phenothiazine.</li>
                        <li>Action: Chlorpromazine acts primarily by:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Dopamine Receptor Blockade: Blocking dopamine D2 receptors in various brain pathways, particularly in the mesolimbic pathway, which is thought to be overactive in psychosis. This dopamine receptor antagonism is believed to be the primary mechanism for its antipsychotic effects.</li>
                                <li>Other Receptor Effects: Also has significant effects on other receptors, including alpha-adrenergic, histamine (H1), and muscarinic cholinergic receptors, contributing to its side effect profile and some therapeutic actions (e.g., antiemetic, sedative).</li>
                                <li>Antiemetic Effect: Has a significant antiemetic effect, likely due to dopamine receptor blockade in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the medulla.</li>
                                <li>Sedative and Anticholinergic Effects: Produces sedative effects through histamine receptor blockade and anticholinergic effects through muscarinic receptor blockade.</li>
                                <li>Hypotensive Effect: Can cause hypotension, particularly orthostatic hypotension, due to alpha-adrenergic blockade.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Uses: Chlorpromazine is used to manage:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Psychotic Disorders: Acute and chronic psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, manic phase of bipolar disorder, and other psychotic states. It helps reduce positive symptoms of psychosis like hallucinations and delusions.</li>
                                <li>Preanesthetic medication: To relieve anxiety and induce sedation before anesthesia.</li>
                                <li>Intractable hiccups: Treatment of persistent, intractable hiccups.</li>
                                <li>Nausea and vomiting: Effective as an antiemetic, particularly for severe nausea and vomiting unresponsive to other treatments.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Explain the mechanism of action of Chlorpromazine as an antipsychotic drug. How does its blockade of dopamine receptors in the brain help manage psychotic symptoms, and why does it also lead to various side effects?</p>
                    <details class="solution">
                        <summary>View Solution</summary>
                        <div class="solution-content">
                            <p><strong>Mechanism of Action of Chlorpromazine as an Antipsychotic Drug:</strong> Chlorpromazine exerts its antipsychotic effects primarily by blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the brain. This action particularly targets the mesolimbic pathway, which is believed to be overactive in psychotic disorders like schizophrenia.</p>
                            <p><strong>Dopamine Receptor Blockade and Management of Psychotic Symptoms:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Reduction of Dopamine Activity: In psychotic disorders, there is often an excess of dopamine activity in certain brain pathways, leading to symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thought. Chlorpromazine, by blocking dopamine D2 receptors, reduces dopamine neurotransmission in these pathways.</li>
                                <li>Alleviation of Positive Symptoms: The blockade of dopamine receptors, especially in the mesolimbic pathway, is thought to be responsible for reducing the positive symptoms of psychosis. Positive symptoms are those that are "added" in psychosis, such as hallucinations (sensory experiences not based in reality) and delusions (false beliefs). By normalizing dopamine activity, chlorpromazine helps to diminish these symptoms.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Reasons for Side Effects Due to Dopamine Receptor Blockade and Other Receptor Effects:</strong> While dopamine receptor blockade is key to its antipsychotic action, Chlorpromazine's non-selective binding to other receptors leads to a wide range of side effects:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Dopamine Pathways in Basal Ganglia (Nigrostriatal Pathway): Blockade of dopamine receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway can lead to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), such as parkinsonism (tremors, rigidity, slow movement), dystonia (muscle spasms), and akathisia (restlessness).</li>
                                <li>Tuberoinfundibular Pathway: Dopamine blockade in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, which normally inhibits prolactin release, leads to hyperprolactinemia. This can cause gynecomastia (breast enlargement in males), galactorrhea (milk discharge), and menstrual irregularities in women.</li>
                                <li>Alpha-Adrenergic Receptor Blockade: Blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors leads to vasodilation, causing orthostatic hypotension and dizziness.</li>
                                <li>Histamine (H1) Receptor Blockade: Antihistaminic effects result in sedation and drowsiness, common side effects of chlorpromazine.</li>
                                <li>Muscarinic Cholinergic Receptor Blockade: Anticholinergic effects, such as dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and urinary retention, are due to muscarinic receptor blockade.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In summary, while Chlorpromazine's dopamine receptor blockade effectively reduces psychotic symptoms, its action on other receptor systems throughout the brain and body results in a broad profile of side effects. The non-selectivity of first-generation antipsychotics like Chlorpromazine is a primary reason for the higher incidence of side effects compared to newer, more selective antipsychotics.</p>
