                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><strong>Tetracyclines</strong> are a class of broad-spectrum antibiotics effective against a wide range of bacteria, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as other microorganisms like mycoplasmas, rickettsiae, and chlamydiae. However, due to increasing resistance, their use has become more selective. Key aspects of tetracyclines include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spectrum of Activity: Broad-spectrum antibiotics, effective against many bacterial types, but resistance is a growing concern limiting their widespread use for common infections.</li>
                        <li>Mechanism of Action: Tetracyclines inhibit bacterial protein synthesis, which is essential for bacterial growth and function.</li>
                    </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Inhibition of Protein Synthesis: Tetracyclines inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria. This binding prevents the attachment of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, thus blocking the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain and halting protein synthesis.</li>
                                <li>Bacteriostatic Effect: The drugs are primarily bacteriostatic, meaning they inhibit bacterial growth and reproduction, but do not typically kill bacteria directly. The host's immune system then clears the infection. They are bactericidal at high concentrations against certain organisms.</li>

                            <p><strong>Contraindication of Tetracyclines in Children Under 8 Years Old and During Pregnancy:</strong> Tetracyclines are contraindicated in children under 8 years of age and during pregnancy (especially the last trimester) due to the risk of specific and significant developmental toxicities related to bone and teeth development.</p>
                            <p><strong>Specific Side Effects of Concern:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Children Under 8 Years Old:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Permanent Teeth Discoloration: Tetracyclines have a high affinity for calcium and can bind to calcium in developing teeth, leading to permanent discoloration of teeth. This manifests as a yellow, gray, or brown staining of the teeth, which is cosmetically undesirable and permanent.</li>
                                        <li>Delayed Bone Growth: Tetracyclines can also deposit in bone tissue and interfere with bone growth. This can result in temporary or permanent stunting of bone growth in young children, affecting their skeletal development.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>During Pregnancy:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Fetal Teeth and Bone Development: If taken during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters when fetal tooth and bone development is most active, tetracyclines can cross the placenta and deposit in fetal teeth and bones, causing teeth staining and potential bone growth issues in the developing fetus.</li>
                                        <li>Hepatotoxicity Risk: Although less common, there is a risk of hepatotoxicity in pregnant women with tetracycline use, which poses additional risks to both mother and fetus.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Alternative Antibiotics:</strong> Given these risks, alternative antibiotics are generally preferred in children under 8 and pregnant women, depending on the infection being treated:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For Children:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Amoxicillin: Often used for respiratory and ear infections.</li>
                                        <li>Cephalosporins: Like cefalexin or cefuroxime, are broad-spectrum antibiotics generally safe for children.</li>
                                        <li>Macrolides: Like erythromycin or azithromycin, are alternatives for respiratory and skin infections, especially if penicillin allergy is a concern.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>For Pregnant Women:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Penicillins and Cephalosporins: Generally considered safe and often used for various infections during pregnancy.</li>
                                        <li>Macrolides: Erythromycin and azithromycin can be used for certain infections, depending on the specific pathogen and clinical situation.</li>
                                        <li>Nitrofurantoin or Fosfomycin: For urinary tract infections, often considered safe in pregnancy, especially in the first and second trimesters, but should be used cautiously and avoided near term in some guidelines due to potential neonatal hemolytic anemia risk.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The choice of alternative antibiotic depends on the type of infection, susceptibility patterns, patient allergies, and other clinical factors. It's crucial to select antibiotics that are both safe and effective for these vulnerable populations, avoiding tetracyclines to prevent developmental harm.</p>
