\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR DRUGS}
1.Anti-hypertensive Agents
2. Drugs Used In Heart Failure
3. Anti-angina Drugs
4. Drugs Used In Dyslipidemia

Antihypertensive drugs
Blood pressure is probably one of the most variable but best regulated functions of the body.

The purpose of the control of blood pressure is to keep blood flow constant to vital organs such as the heart, brain, and kidneys.

Without constant blood flow to these organs, death ensues within seconds, minutes, or days.

\section*{Hypertension represents an elevation in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure.}

Essential hypertension is characterized by a chronic elevation in blood pressure that occurs without evidence of other disease. Secondary hypertension Elevation of blood pressure that results from some other disorders, such as kidney disease.

The pathogenesis of essential hypertension involves :
-the kidney and its role in regulating extracellular fluid
volume through salt and water elimination.
-sympathetic nervous system hyperreactivity.
-renin-angiotensin system activity.
-in tracellular sodium and calcium levels.

\title{
Uncontrolled hypertension produces increased demands on the heart (complications).
}
-Left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure
-Atherosclerosis on the vessels of the arterial system
-Kidney disease
-Retinopathy
-Stroke.

\section*{Types of Receptors}
- Alpha adrenergic(alpha 1 and alpha 2)

Vasoconstriction, raise BP
They both respond epinephrine and norepinephrine)
Activation leads to peripheral resistance and increase in arterial BP.
-Beta-1
Heart stimulation-activation leads to increase in contractile force and increase of heart rate. Excess stimulation leads to arrythmias.
-Beta-2
Effects in smooth muscles.
Activation leads to vascular and non vascular smooth muscle relaxation.These drugs are used in treatment of asthma.

\section*{Oral administration is used for essential hypertension. Intravenous administration is reserved for acute myocardial infarction (atenolol, metoprolol).}

Cardiac dysrhythmias(esmolol, propranolol).

Severe hypertension (labetalol).

Blocking renal beta1 receptors suppress secretion of renin.
By blocking beta2 receptors produces three major effects:
(1)bronchoconstriction (through beta2 blockade in the lung),
(2) vasoconstriction (through beta2 blockade on certain blood vessels)
(3) reduced glycogenolysis (through beta2 blockade in skeletal muscle and liver).

\section*{Adverse Effects The most serious adverse effects result from blockade of beta1 receptors in the heart and blockade of beta 2 receptors in the lung.}

Bradycardia.
Beta1 blockade in the heart can cause bradycardia.
Heart rate should be assessed before each dose.
AV Heart Block.
By slowing conduction of impulses through the AV node can cause AV heart
block.
The drug is contraindicated for patients with preexisting AV block.

\section*{Heart Failure.}

In patients with cardiac disease, suppression of myocardial contractility can result in heart failure. Patients should be informed about the early signs of heart failure
(shortness of breath, night coughs, swelling of the extremities

\section*{Principal indications for the beta blockers are cardiovascular: hypertension, angina pectoris, heart failure, and supraventricular tachydysrhythmias.}

\section*{Indirect-Acting Antiadrenergic Agents Clonidine}

Clonidine [Catapres] is an antihypertensive drug that acts within the CNS.
Except for rare instances of rebound hypertension, the drug is generally free of serious adverse effects.
In addition to its use in hypertension, clonidine is used to relieve severe pain of cancer.
To provide pain relief, the drug must be administered by epidural infusion.

Mechanism of Antihypertensive Action Clonidine is an alpha2-adrenergic agonist that causes "selective" activation of alpha2 receptors in the CNS-specifically, in brainstem areas associated with autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system.
By activating central alpha2 receptors, clonidine reduces sympathetic outflow to blood vessels and the heart.

\section*{Pharmacologic Effects}

The most significant effects of clonidine occur in the heart and vascular system.
By suppressing the firing of sympathetic nerves to the heart, clonidine can cause bradycardia and a decrease in cardiac output.
By suppressing sympathetic regulation of blood vessels, the drug promotes vasodilation.
The net result of cardiac suppression and vasodilation is decreased blood pressure.

\section*{Drug Effects on Receptors}

Drugs can have two types of effects on receptors.
- Stimulating, causing a reaction
- Blocking, preventing a reaction
- Dopamine blocking
- Anticholinergics
e.g. Enalapril, captopril, lisinopril,ramipril.
Mxn: inhibit conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.
Adm: all administered per oral.
Effects:
i) reduce peripheral vascular resistance
ii) reduce circulating blood volume.

S/E: hypotension, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, dry cough, allergic skin rashes.
C/I: Renal failure

\section*{1. ANTIHYPERTENSIVES}
