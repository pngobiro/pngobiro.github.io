                        <p>The ACE inhibitors are important drugs for treating hypertension, heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, and myocardial infarction (MI). In addition, they are used to prevent adverse cardiovascular events in patients at risk. Their most prominent adverse effects are cough, angioedema, first-dose hypotension, and hyperkalemia. For all of these agents, beneficial effects result largely from suppressing formation of angiotensin II.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mechanism of Action and Overview of Pharmacologic Effects:</strong></p>
                        <p>ACE inhibitors produce their beneficial and adverse effects by (1) reducing levels of angiotensin II (through inhibition of ACE) and (2) increasing levels of bradykinin (through inhibition of kinase II)- lead to cough and angioedema.</p>
                        <p>By reducing levels of angiotensin II, ACE inhibitors can dilate blood vessels (primarily arterioles and to a lesser extent veins), reduce blood volume (through effects on the kidney), and, importantly, prevent or reverse pathologic changes in the heart and blood vessels mediated by angiotensin II and aldosterone.</p>
                        <p>Inhibition of ACE can also cause hyperkalemia and fetal injury.</p>
                        <p>Elevation of bradykinin causes vasodilation (secondary to increased production of prostaglandins and nitric oxide) but can also promote cough and angioedema.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pharmacokinetics:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nearly all ACE inhibitors are administered orally. The only exception is enalaprilat (the active form of enalapril), which is given IV.</li>
                            <li>Except for captopril and moexipril, all oral ACE inhibitors can be administered with food.</li>
                            <li>With the exception of captopril, all ACE inhibitors have prolonged half-lives, and hence can be administered just once or twice a day. Captopril is administered 2 or 3 times a day.</li>
                            <li>With the exception of lisinopril, all ACE inhibitors are prodrugs that must undergo conversion to their active form in the small intestine and liver. Lisinopril is active as administered.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="arbs">b) Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs)</h3>
                        <p>Examples: Losartan, valsartan, telmisartan</p>
                        <p><strong>Adm:</strong> all administered per oral.</p>
                        <p><strong>MOA:</strong> bind and block angiotensin II receptor.</p>
                        <p>S/E, C/I and effects are same as in ACE inhibitors.</p>
                        <p>The angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are a relatively new family of drugs whose indications are evolving. Initially, ARBs were approved only for hypertension. Today, they also are approved for heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, myocardial infarction, and stroke prevention.</p>
                        <p>ARBs block access of angiotensin II to its receptors in blood vessels, the adrenals, and all other tissues. As a result, ARBs have effects much like those of the ACE inhibitors.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>By blocking angiotensin II receptors on blood vessels, ARBs cause dilation of arterioles and veins.</li>
                            <li>By blocking angiotensin II receptors in the heart, ARBs can prevent angiotensin II from inducing pathologic changes in cardiac structure.</li>
                            <li>By blocking angiotensin II receptors in the adrenals, ARBs decrease release of aldosterone, and can thereby increase renal excretion of sodium and water.</li>
                            <li>Sodium and water excretion is further increased through dilation of renal blood vessels.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>NB:</strong> In contrast to the ACE inhibitors, ARBs do not inhibit kinase II, and hence do not increase levels of bradykinin in the lung. As a result, ARBs do not promote cough, the most common reason for stopping ACE inhibitors.</p>
                        <p>The therapeutic uses for ARBs (7 drugs):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>heart failure - valsartan</li>
                            <li>myocardial infarction (post)- valsartan</li>
                            <li>prevention of stroke - losartan</li>
                            <li>diabetic neuropathy - losartan and irbesartan</li>
                            <li>and hypertension - All</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Contraindication:</strong> Like the ACE inhibitors, ARBs can injure the developing fetus if taken during the second or third trimester of pregnancy, and hence are contraindicated during this period.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="dris">Direct Renin Inhibitors</h3>
                        <p>Direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) are drugs that act on renin to inhibit the conversion of angiotensinogen into angiotensin I. By decreasing production of angiotensin I, DRIs can suppress the entire RAAS. Currently, only one DRI is available.</p>
                        <p><strong>Aliskiren [Tekturna]</strong>, approved for hypertension in 2007, was the first DRI on the market. Blood pressure reduction equals that seen with ACE inhibitors. Aliskiren causes less cough and angioedema than the ACE inhibitors, but poses similar risks to the developing fetus.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="aldosterone-antagonists">Aldosterone Antagonists</h3>
                        <p>Aldosterone antagonists are drugs that block receptors for aldosterone. Two such agents are available: eplerenone and spironolactone. Both drugs have similar structures and actions, and both are used for the same disorders: hypertension and heart failure. They differ, however, in that spironolactone is less selective than eplerenone. As a result, spironolactone causes more side effects.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Eplerenone</h4>
                        <p>Eplerenone, approved in September 2002, is the first representative of a new class of agents: selective aldosterone receptor blockers. The drug is used for hypertension and heart failure, and has one significant side effect: hyperkalemia.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mechanism of Action:</strong> Eplerenone produces selective blockade of aldosterone receptors, having little or no effect on receptors for other steroid hormones (eg, glucocorticoids, progesterone, androgens). In the kidney, activation of aldosterone receptors promotes excretion of potassium and retention of sodium and water. Receptor blockade has the opposite effect: retention of potassium and increased excretion of sodium and water.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Spironolactone</h4>
                        <p>Spironolactone [Aldactone], a much older drug than eplerenone, blocks receptors for aldosterone, but also binds with receptors for other steroid hormones (eg, glucocorticoids, progesterone, androgens). Blockade of aldosterone receptors underlies beneficial effects in hypertension and heart failure.</p>

                        <p>Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are drugs that prevent calcium ions from entering cells. These agents have their greatest effects on the heart and blood vessels. CCBs are used widely to treat hypertension, angina pectoris, and cardiac dysrhythmias. Alternative names for CCBs are calcium antagonists and slow channel blockers.</p>
                        <p>Calcium channels are gated pores in the cytoplasmic membrane that regulate entry of calcium ions into cells. Calcium entry plays a critical role in the function of vascular smooth muscle (VSM) and the heart.</p>
                        <p><strong>Vascular Smooth Muscle:</strong> In VSM, calcium channels regulate contraction. When an action potential travels down the surface of a smooth muscle cell, calcium channels open and calcium ions flow inward, thereby initiating the contractile process. If calcium channels are blocked, contraction will be prevented and vasodilation will result. At therapeutic doses, CCBs act selectively on peripheral arterioles and arteries and arterioles of the heart. CCBs have no significant effect on veins.</p>
                        <p><strong>Heart:</strong> In the heart, calcium channels help regulate function of the myocardium, the sinoatrial (SA) node, and the atrioventricular (AV) node. Calcium channels at all three sites are coupled to beta1-adrenergic receptors.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Myocardium:</strong> In cardiac muscle, calcium entry has a positive inotropic effect. That is, calcium increases force of contraction. If calcium channels in atrial and ventricular muscle are blocked, contractile force will diminish.</li>
                            <li><strong>SA Node:</strong> Pacemaker activity of the SA node is regulated by calcium influx. When calcium channels are open, spontaneous discharge of the SA node increases. Conversely, when calcium channels close, pacemaker activity declines. Hence, the effect of calcium channel blockade is to reduce heart rate.</li>
                            <li><strong>AV Node:</strong> Impulses that originate in the SA node must pass through the AV node on their way to the ventricles. Because of this arrangement, regulation of AV conduction plays a critical role in coordinating contraction of the ventricles with contraction of the atria. The excitability of AV nodal cells is regulated by calcium entry. When calcium channels are open, calcium entry increases and cells of the AV node discharge more readily. Conversely, when calcium channels are closed, discharge of AV nodal cells is suppressed. Hence, the effect of calcium channel blockade is to decrease velocity of conduction through the AV node.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Coupling of Cardiac Calcium Channels to Beta1-Adrenergic Receptors:</strong> In the heart, calcium channels are coupled to beta1-adrenergic receptors. As a result, when cardiac beta1 receptors are activated, calcium influx is enhanced. Conversely, when beta1 receptors are blocked, calcium influx is suppressed. Because of this relationship, CCBs and beta blockers have identical effects on the heart. That is, they both reduce force of contraction, slow heart rate, and suppress conduction through the AV node.</p>
                        <p><strong>Adm:</strong> per oral.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mxn:</strong> inhibit influx of calcium into arterial smooth muscle cells hence reducing contraction.</p>
                        <p><strong>Effect:</strong> reduce peripheral vascular resistance.</p>
                        <p><strong>S/E:</strong> hypotension, palpitation, perspiration, dizziness, headache, GIT disturbance.</p>
                        <p><strong>C/I:</strong> cardiogenic shock, hypotension, pregnancy (except nifedipine)</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="beta-blockers-general">Beta-Blockers (General Discussion)</h3>
                        <p>Oral administration is used for essential hypertension. Intravenous administration is reserved for acute myocardial infarction (atenolol, metoprolol).</p>
                        <p>Cardiac dysrhythmias (esmolol, propranolol).</p>
                        <p>Severe hypertension (labetalol).</p>
                        <p>Blocking renal beta1 receptors suppress secretion of renin.</p>
                        <p>By blocking beta2 receptors produces three major effects: (1) bronchoconstriction (through beta2 blockade in the lung), (2) vasoconstriction (through beta2 blockade on certain blood vessels), and (3) reduced glycogenolysis (through beta2 blockade in skeletal muscle and liver).</p>
                        <p><strong>Adverse Effects:</strong> The most serious adverse effects result from blockade of beta1 receptors in the heart and blockade of beta 2 receptors in the lung.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Bradycardia:</strong> Beta1 blockade in the heart can cause bradycardia. Heart rate should be assessed before each dose.</li>
                            <li><strong>AV Heart Block:</strong> By slowing conduction of impulses through the AV node can cause AV heart block. The drug is contraindicated for patients with preexisting AV block.</li>
                            <li><strong>Heart Failure:</strong> In patients with cardiac disease, suppression of myocardial contractility can result in heart failure. Patients should be informed about the early signs of heart failure (shortness of breath, night coughs, swelling of the extremities).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Principal indications for the beta blockers are cardiovascular: hypertension, angina pectoris, heart failure, and supraventricular tachydysrhythmias.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="sympatholytics">d) Other Sympatholytic Agents</h3>
                        <p><strong>Mxn:</strong> generally they reduce sympathetic effects on arteries and the heart.</p>
                        <p><strong>Effects:</strong> reduce peripheral vascular resistance, reduced cardiac contractility, heart rate & cardiac output.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1. Indirect-Acting Antiadrenergic Agents (e.g., Clonidine)</h4>
                        <p><strong>Clonidine [Catapres]</strong> is an antihypertensive drug that acts within the CNS. Except for rare instances of rebound hypertension, the drug is generally free of serious adverse effects. In addition to its use in hypertension, clonidine is used to relieve severe pain of cancer. To provide pain relief, the drug must be administered by epidural infusion.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mechanism of Antihypertensive Action:</strong> Clonidine is an alpha2-adrenergic agonist that causes "selective" activation of alpha2 receptors in the CNS-specifically, in brainstem areas associated with autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system. By activating central alpha2 receptors, clonidine reduces sympathetic outflow to blood vessels and the heart.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pharmacologic Effects:</strong> The most significant effects of clonidine occur in the heart and vascular system. By suppressing the firing of sympathetic nerves to the heart, clonidine can cause bradycardia and a decrease in cardiac output. By suppressing sympathetic regulation of blood vessels, the drug promotes vasodilation. The net result of cardiac suppression and vasodilation is decreased blood pressure.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2. Centrally acting sympatholytics</h4>
                        <p>e.g. Methyldopa</p>
                        <p><strong>S/E:</strong> sedation, depression, nightmares, hemolytic anaemia, vertigo.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3. Beta-blockers (as sympatholytics)</h4>
                        <p>e.g. propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, atenolol</p>
                        <p><strong>S/E:</strong> bradycardia, bronchospasm, heart failure, hypoglycemia, GIT disturbance. (Refer to detailed Beta-Blockers section for more comprehensive S/E).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="vasodilators-htn">Vasodilators (for Hypertension)</h3>
                        <p>Vasodilation can be produced with a variety of drugs. Some of these drugs act primarily on arterioles, some act primarily on veins, and some act on both types of vessel.</p>
                        <p>The vasodilators are widely used, with indications ranging from hypertension to angina pectoris to heart failure.</p>
                        <p>Four agents-hydralazine, minoxidil, diazoxide, and nitroprusside.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Venodilators:</strong> they reduce preload (the degree of stretch of the ventricular muscle prior to contraction). E.g. isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerine</li>
                            <li><strong>Arterial dilators:</strong> they reduce afterload (the force the heart works against to pump blood). E.g. hydralazine, and Minoxidil</li>
                            <li><strong>Both arterial and venodilators:</strong> E. g. ACE Inhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers, sodium nitroprusside.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>NB: are used in combination with other drugs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Therapeutic Uses:</strong> The vasodilators, as a group, have a broad spectrum of uses. Principal indications are essential hypertension, hypertensive crisis, angina pectoris, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Additional indications include pheochromocytoma, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and production of controlled hypotension during surgery. The specific applications of any particular agent are determined by its pharmacologic profile. Important facets of that profile are route of administration, site of vasodilation (arterioles, veins, or both), and intensity and duration of effects.</p>
