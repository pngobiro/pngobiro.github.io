\section*{INTRODUCTION TO DIURETICS How Diuretics Work}

Most diuretics share the same basic mechanism of action: blockade of sodium and chloride reabsorption.
By blocking the reabsorption of these prominent solutes, diuretics create osmotic
pressure within the nephron that prevents the passive reabsorption of water.
Hence, diuretics cause water and solutes to be retained within the nephron, and thereby promote the excretion of both.

The increase in urine flow that a diuretic produces is directly related to the amount of sodium and chloride reabsorption that it blocks.

Diuretics can cause hypovolemia (from excessive fluid loss), acid-base imbalance, and disturbance of electrolyte levels.

\section*{Classification of Diuretics}

There are four major categories of diuretic drugs:
(1) high-ceiling (loop) diuretics (eg, furosemide);
(2) thiazide diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide);
(3) osmotic diuretics (eg, mannitol); and
(4) potassium-sparing diuretics.

\section*{HIGH-CEILING (LOOP) DIURETICS The high-ceiling agents are the most effective diuretics available. \\ These drugs produce more loss of fluid and electrolytes than any other diuretics. \\ Because their site of action is in the loop of Henle, the high-ceiling agents are also known as loop diuretics.}

\section*{Furosemide}

Furosemide [Lasix] is the most frequently prescribed loop diuretic and will serve as our prototype for the group.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Furosemide acts in the thick segment of the ascending limb of Henle's loop to block reabsorption of sodium and chloride.
By blocking solute reabsorption, furosemide prevents passive reabsorption of water.
Since a substantial amount (20\%) of filtered NaCl is normally reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, interference with reabsorption here can produce profound

Pharmacokinetics
Furosemide can be administered orally, IV, and IM. With oral administration, diuresis begins in 60 minutes and persists for 8 hours.
Oral therapy is used when rapid onset is not required. Effects of intravenous furosemide begin within 5 minutes and last for 2 hours.
Intravenous therapy is used in critical situations (eg, pulmonary edema) that demand immediate mobilization fluid.
Furosemide undergoes hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion.

Furosemide drug should be avoided when less efficacious diuretics (thiazides) will suffice.
Conditions that justify use of furosemide include
(1)pulmonary edema associated with congestive heart failure (CHF);
(2) edema of hepatic, cardiac, or renal origin that has been unresponsive to less efficacious diuretics; and
(3)hypertension that cannot be controlled with other diuretics. Furosemide is especially useful in patients with severe renal impairment.

Adverse Effects
Hyponatremia, Hypochloremia, and Dehydration.
Furosemide can produce excessive loss of sodium, chloride, and water.
Severe dehydration can result.
Signs of evolving dehydration include dry mouth, unusual thirst, and oliguria (scanty urine output).
Impending dehydration can also be anticipated from excessive loss of weight.
If dehydration occurs, furosemide should be withheld.

> Dehydration can promote thrombosis and embolism. Symptoms include headache and pain in the chest, calves, or pelvis.
> The risk of dehydration and its sequelae can be minimized by initiating therapy with low doses, adjusting the dosage carefully, monitoring weight loss every day, and administering furosemide on an intermittent schedule.

Hypotension.
Furosemide can cause a substantial drop in blood pressure.
At least two mechanisms are involved:
(1)loss of volume and
(2) relaxation of venous smooth muscle, which reduces venous return to the heart.
Signs of hypotension include dizziness, light headedness, and fainting.
If blood pressure falls precipitously, furosemide should be discontinued.
Because of the risk of hypotension, blood pressure ÅŸould be monitored routinely.

Outpatients should be taught to monitor their blood pressure and instructed to notify the prescriber if it drops substantially.
Patients should be informed about symptoms of postural hypotension (dizziness, light-headedness) and advised to sit or lie down if these occur.
Patients should be taught that postural hypotension can be minimized by getting up slowly.

\section*{Hypokalemia.}

Potassium is lost through increased secretion in the distal nephron.
If serum potassium falls below $3.5 \mathbf{~ m E q} / \mathbf{L}$, fatal dysrhythmias may result.
Hypokalemia can be minimized by consuming potassium-rich foods (eg, dried fruits, nuts, spinach, citrus fruits, potatoes, bananas), taking potassium supplements, or using a potassium-sparing diuretic.

\section*{Ototoxicity.}

Rarely, loop diuretics cause hearing impairment. With furosemide, deafness is transient. With ethacrynic acid (another loop diuretic), irreversible hearing loss has occurred.
The ability to impair hearing is unique to the highceiling agents; diuretics in other classes are not ototoxic.
Because of the risk of hearing loss, caution is needed when high-ceiling diuretics are used in combination with other ototoxic drugs (eg, aminoglycoside antibiotics).

Hyperglycemia.
Elevation of plasma glucose is a potential, albeit uncommon, complication of furosemide therapy.

Hyperglycemia appears to result from inhibition of insulin release.
Increased glycogenolysis and decreased glycogen synthesis may also contribute.

When furosemide is taken by a diabetic patient, he or she should be especially diligent about monitoring blood glucose content.

\section*{Hyperuricemia.}

Elevation of plasma uric acid is a frequent side effect of treatment.
For most patients, furosemide-induced hyperuricemia is asymptomatic.
However, for patients predisposed to gout, elevation of uric acid may precipitate a gouty attack.
Patients should be informed about symptoms of gout (tenderness or swelling in joints) and instructed to notify the prescriber if these develop.

\section*{Use in Pregnancy.}

When administered to pregnant laboratory animals, high-ceiling diuretics have caused maternal death, abortion, fetal resorption, and other adverse effects. There are no definitive studies on loop diuretics during human pregnancy.
However, given the toxicity displayed in animals, prudence dictates that pregnant women use these drugs only if absolutely required.

\section*{Potassium-Sparing Diuretics.}

The potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene) can help counterbalance the potassium-wasting effects of furosemide, thereby reducing the risk of hypokalemia. Lithium.
Lithium is used to treat bipolar disorder .
In patients with low sodium, excretion of lithium is reduced.
Hence, by lowering sodium levels, furosemide can cause lithium to accumulate to toxic levels. Accordingly, lithium levels should be monitored, and, if they climb too high, lithium dosage should be

\section*{THIAZIDES AND RELATED DIURETICS}

The thiazide diuretics (also known as benzothiadiazides) have effects similar to those of the loop diuretics.
Like the loop diuretics, thiazides increase renal excretion of sodium, chloride, potassium, and water.
In addition, thiazides elevate plasma levels of uric acid and glucose (risk of hyperglycemia).

The principal difference between the thiazides and high-ceiling agents is that the maximum diuresis produced by the thiazides is considerably lower than the maximum diuresis produced by the high-ceiling drugs.
In addition, whereas loop diuretics can be effective even when urine flow is scant, thiazides cannot.

Hydrochlorothiazide(HCTZ)
Hydrochlorothiazide is the most widely used thiazide diuretic.
Used in hypertension.

\section*{Hydrochlorothiazide promotes urine production by blocking the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the early segment of the distal convoluted tubule.}

Retention of sodium and chloride in the nephron causes water to be retained as well, thereby producing an increased flow of urine.

Since only $10 \%$ of filtered sodium and chloride is normally reabsorbed at the site where thiazides act, the maximum urine flow these drugs can produce is lower than with the high-ceiling drugs.

The ability of thiazides to promote diuresis is dependent on adequate kidney function.

These drugs are ineffective when GFR is low (less than 15 to $20 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ ).

Hence, in contrast to the high-ceiling agents, thiazides cannot be used to promote fluid loss in patients with

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Diuresis begins about 2 hours after oral administration.

Effects peak within 4 to 6 hours, and may persist up to 12 hours. Most of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine.

\section*{Therapeutic Uses}

\section*{Essential Hypertension.}

The primary indication for hydrochlorothiazide is hypertension, a condition for which thiazides are often drugs of first choice.

For many hypertensive patients, blood pressure can be controlled with a thiazide alone, although many other patients require multiple-drug therapy.

\section*{Edema.}

Thiazides are preferred drugs for mobilizing edema associated with mild to moderate heart failure.
They are also given to mobilize edema associated with hepatic or renal disease.

\section*{Diabetes Insipidus.}

Diabetes insipidus is a rare condition characterized by excessive production of urine.
In patients with this disorder, thiazides reduce urine production by $30 \%$ to $50 \%$. The mechanism of this paradoxical effect is unclear.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

The adverse effects of thiazide diuretics are similar to those of the high-ceiling agents.
In fact, with the exception that thiazides lack ototoxic actions, the adverse effects of the thiazides and loop diuretics are nearly identical.
Hyponatremia, Hypochloremia, and Dehydration. Loss of sodium, chloride, and water can lead to hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and dehydration.

It should be noted, however, that since the diuresis produced by thiazides is moderate, these drugs have a smaller impact on sodium, chloride, and water than do the loop diuretics.

To evaluate fluid and electrolyte status, electrolyte levels should be determined periodically, and the patient should be weighed on a regular basis.

\section*{Hypokalemia.}

Like the high-ceiling diuretics, the thiazides can cause hypokalemia from excessive potassium excretion. Potassium levels should be measured periodically, and, if serum potassium falls below 3.5 mEq/L, treatment with potassium supplements or a potassium-sparing diuretic should be instituted. Hypokalemia can be minimized by eating potassiumrich foods.

Use in Pregnancy and Lactation.
The thiazides have direct and indirect effects on the developing fetus. By reducing blood volume, thiazides can decrease placental perfusion, and may thereby compromise fetal nutrition and growth.
Furthermore, thiazides can cross the placental barrier. Potential effects include electrolyte imbalance, hypoglycemia, jaundice, and hemolytic anemia. Thiazides should not be used routinely during pregnancy.
Edema of pregnancy is not an indication for diuretic therapy, except when severe.
