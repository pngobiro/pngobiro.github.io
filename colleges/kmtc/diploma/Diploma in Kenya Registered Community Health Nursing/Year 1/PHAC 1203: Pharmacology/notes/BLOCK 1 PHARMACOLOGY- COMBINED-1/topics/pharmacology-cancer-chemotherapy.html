                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The cell cycle has four major phases:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>G1,</strong> in which cells prepare to synthesize DNA;</li>
                            <li><strong>S,</strong> in which cells synthesize DNA;</li>
                            <li><strong>G2,</strong> in which cells prepare for mitosis (division); and</li>
                            <li><strong>M,</strong> in which cells actually divide.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Following mitosis, the resulting daughter cells may either enter G1 and repeat the cycle, or enter G0 and become mitotically dormant.</p>
                        <p>The growth fraction of a tissue is defined as the ratio of proliferating cells to cells in G0.</p>
                        <p>Tissues with a large percentage of proliferating cells and few cells in G0 have a high growth fraction. Conversely, tissues composed mostly of G0 cells have a low growth fraction.</p>
                        <p>Cytotoxic anticancer drugs are more toxic to cancers that have a high growth fraction than to cancers that have a low growth fraction. Why? Because cytotoxic anticancer drugs are more active against proliferating cells than against cells in G0.</p>
                        <p>The most common cancers-solid tumors of the breast, lung, prostate, colon, and rectum -have a low growth fraction, and hence respond poorly to drugs. In contrast, only some rarer cancers-such as acute lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, and certain testicular cancers-have a high growth fraction, and hence tend to respond well.</p>
                        <p>To cure a patient of cancer, we must produce 100% cell kill, which is rare with chemotherapy alone.</p>
                        <p>Killing of cancer cells follows first-order kinetics. That is, at any given dose, drugs kill a constant percentage of malignant cells, regardless of how many cells are present.</p>
                        <p>Over the course of chemotherapy, cancer cells often become drug resistant, thereby decreasing the chance of success.</p>
                        <p>Cancer chemotherapy: It is the use of drugs to inhibit or kill proliferating cancer cells, while leaving host cells unharmed, or at least recoverable.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The cell cycle</h3>
                        <p>These are phases that all cells -both normal and neoplastic- must traverse before and during cell division.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of intermittent chemotherapy is to allow normal cells to repopulate between rounds of treatment. Unfortunately, if the cancer cells repopulate as fast as (or faster than) normal cells, there will be no reduction in tumor burden with each round of treatment, and hence treatment will fail.</p>
                        <p>Multidrug chemotherapy is generally much more effective than single-drug therapy. Why? Because combination therapy can (1) suppress drug resistance, (2) increase cell kill, and (3) reduce injury to normal cells.</p>
                        <p>Ideally, the drugs used in combination therapy should have (1) different mechanisms of action, (2) minimally overlapping toxicities, and (3) good efficacy when used alone.</p>

                        <p>Toxicity to normal tissues is the major obstacle to successful therapy with cytotoxic anticancer drugs.</p>
                        <p>Cytotoxic anticancer drugs injure normal tissue because these drugs lack selective toxicity.</p>
                        <p>As a rule, serious toxicity occurs to normal tissues that have a high growth fraction (ie, bone marrow, GI epithelium, hair follicles, spermforming cells).</p>
                        <p>Myelosuppression (toxicity to bone marrow) can reduce the number of neutrophils, platelets, and erythrocytes, thereby posing a risk of infection (from loss of neutrophils), bleeding (from loss of platelets), and anemia (from loss of erythrocytes).</p>
                        <p>Loss of neutrophils and platelets during chemotherapy is common; significant loss of erythrocytes is relatively rare, but can happen with certain drugs (eg, cisplatin).</p>
                        <p>In patients taking myelosuppressive drugs, neutrophil counts must be monitored.</p>
                        <p>When a neutropenic patient develops an infection, immediate and vigorous intervention is required. Until lab reports on the identity and drug sensitivity of the infecting organism are available, empiric therapy with IV antibiotics should be instituted.</p>
                        <p>Neutropenia can be minimized by treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, both of which act on the bone marrow to increase neutrophil production.</p>
                        <p>By injuring the epithelial lining of the GI tract, anticancer drugs often cause stomatitis and diarrhea.</p>
                        <p>Many anticancer drugs cause moderate to severe nausea and vomiting, by stimulating the chemoreceptor trigger zone.</p>
                        <p>Nausea and vomiting can be reduced by premedication with antiemetics.</p>
                        <p>Anticancer drugs often injure hair follicles, thereby causing alopecia (hair loss).</p>
                        <p>Anticancer drugs can cause fetal malformation and death. Accordingly, women undergoing chemotherapy should be warned against becoming pregnant.</p>
                        <p>Anticancer drugs can cause irreversible male sterility. Accordingly, men undergoing chemotherapy should be counseled about possible sperm banking.</p>
                        <p>Chemotherapy can cause hyperuricemia as a result of DNA degradation secondary to massive cell death.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The cytotoxic agents constitute the largest class of anticancer drugs. As their name implies, these agents act directly on cancer cells to cause their death.</p>
                        <p>The cytotoxic drugs can be subdivided into eight major groups:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>alkylating agents,</li>
                            <li>platinum compounds,</li>
                            <li>antimetabolites,</li>
                            <li>hypomethylating agents,</li>
                            <li>antitumor antibiotics,</li>
                            <li>mitotic inhibitors,</li>
                            <li>topoisomerase inhibitors, and</li>
                            <li>miscellaneous cytotoxic drugs.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Cytotoxic anticancer drugs act directly on cancer cells and healthy cells to produce cell death.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cell-cycle phase-specific drugs</h3>
                        <p>Cell-cycle phase-specific drugs are effective only during a specific phase of the cell cycle (eg, S phase, M phase). Accordingly, they are only active against cells that are participating in the cell cycle. Cells in G0 are spared.</p>
                        <p>To be effective, phase-specific drugs must be present as neoplastic cells cycle through the phase in which the drugs act. In practical terms, this means that phase-specific drugs must be in the blood continuously over a long period.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cell-cycle phase-nonspecific drugs</h3>
                        <p>Cell-cycle phase-nonspecific drugs can affect cells during any phase of the cell cycle, including G0.</p>
                        <p>Although phase-nonspecific drugs can inflict biochemical lesions at any time during the cell cycle, they usually are more toxic to proliferating cells than to cells in G0. Why? Because (1) G0 cells often have time to repair drug induced damage before it can result in significant harm, and (2) toxicity may not become manifest until the cells attempt to divide.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Alkylating agents</h4>
                        <p>Alkylating agents injure cells primarily by forming covalent bonds with DNA.</p>
                        <p>Bifunctional alkylating agents form cross-links in DNA, and thereby prevent DNA replication. Bifunctional agents are more effective than monofunctional agents.</p>
                        <p>Because alkylation reactions can take place at any time during the cell cycle, alkylating agents are considered cell-cycle phase nonspecific.</p>
                        <p>Cyclophosphamide, the most widely used alkylating agent, is active against a broad spectrum of neoplastic diseases.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Antimetabolites</h4>
                        <p>Antimetabolites are analogs of important natural metabolites, and hence are able to disrupt critical metabolic processes, especially DNA replication.</p>
                        <p>Most antimetabolites are phase specific.</p>
                        <p>Methotrexate, a folic acid analog, prevents conversion of folic acid to its active form. Cell kill results primarily from disruption of DNA synthesis.</p>
                        <p>Fluorouracil, a uracil analog, undergoes intracellular activation, after which it inhibits thymidylate synthetase, thereby depriving cells of thymidylate needed to make DNA.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Antitumor antibiotics</h4>
                        <p>Antitumor antibiotics are used to treat cancer, not infections.</p>
                        <p>Antitumor antibiotics fall into two major groups: anthracyclines (which damage the heart) and nonanthracyclines (which don't).</p>
                        <p>Doxorubicin is an anthracycline-type antitumor antibiotic.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mitotic inhibitors (Vinca Alkaloids)</h4>
                        <p>Vincristine and vinblastine block assembly of the microtubules that move chromosomes during cell division. Accordingly, the drugs are M-phase specific.</p>
                        <p>Vincristine is toxic to peripheral nerves, but does not significantly suppress bone marrow function. Because it spares bone marrow, vincristine can be safely combined with drugs that suppress bone marrow.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to vincristine, vinblastine causes significant bone marrow suppression but is relatively harmless to peripheral nerves.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Asparaginase</h4>
                        <p>Asparaginase converts asparagine (amino acid) into aspartic acid, and thereby deprives cells of asparagine needed to make proteins. Cytotoxicity is limited primarily to leukemic lymphoblasts. Why? Because these cells are unable to manufacture their own asparagine, whereas normal cells can.</p>

                        <p>Hormonal anticancer drugs act through specific hormone receptors on target tissues. As a result, their actions are fairly selective, and their toxicity to normal cells is generally low.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Glucocorticoids</h3>
                        <p>Glucocorticoids are toxic to cancers of lymphoid origin, including acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemias, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.</p>
                        <p>In addition to their use against lymphoid-derived cancers, glucocorticoids are used to manage complications of cancer and cancer therapy. Specific benefits include suppression of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, reduction of cerebral edema secondary to irradiation of the cranium, reduction of pain secondary to nerve compression or edema, and suppression of hypercalcemia in steroid-responsive tumors. Also, glucocorticoids can improve appetite and promote weight gain, and may impart a generalized sense of well-being.</p>
                        <p>When glucocorticoids are used acutely, their toxicities are both mild and manageable. However, when used long term, these drugs can cause many serious toxicities, including osteoporosis, adrenal insufficiency, increased susceptibility to infection, and peptic ulcers.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer</h3>
                        <p>Advanced prostate cancer is treated with androgen deprivation, which can be achieved with castration or drug therapy. Early (localized) prostate cancer is treated with surgery or radiation, sometimes followed by androgen deprivation.</p>
                        <p>Androgen deprivation can be achieved with two types of drugs: gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and androgen receptor blockers.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Leuprolide (GnRH Agonist)</h4>
                        <p>Leuprolide, a GnRH agonist, has a biphasic mechanism of action. During the initial phase, the drug stimulates release of interstitial cell-stimulating hormone (ICSH) from the pituitary, and thereby increases production of testosterone by the testes. As a result, there may be a transient "flare" in prostate cancer symptoms. With continuous use, the drug suppresses ICSH release (negative feedback mechanism), and thereby causes testosterone production to fall.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Flutamide (Androgen Receptor Blocker)</h4>
                        <p>Flutamide, an androgen receptor blocker, is used in combination with a GnRH agonist to treat prostate cancer. Benefits derive from (1) preventing cancer cells from undergoing increased stimulation during the initial phase of GnRH therapy, and (2) blocking the effects of adrenal androgens on prostate cells.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Antiestrogens for Breast Cancer</h3>
                        <p>Breast cancer is treated with surgery, radiation, cytotoxic drugs, and hormonal agents, of which there are two major groups: antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors.</p>
                        <p>Antiestrogens fall into two major categories: (1) pure estrogen receptor antagonists and (2) SERMs, which block estrogen receptors in some tissues, and activate estrogen receptors in others.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Tamoxifen (SERM)</h4>
                        <p>Tamoxifen, a SERM, is approved for prevention and treatment of breast cancer. Benefits derive from blocking estrogen receptors on tumor cells.</p>
                        <p>By activating certain estrogen receptors, tamoxifen increases the risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Raloxifene (SERM)</h4>
                        <p>Like tamoxifen, raloxifene (a SERM) decreases the risk of breast cancer. Compared with tamoxifen, raloxifene carries a lower risk of uterine cancer, and hence appears safer than tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Fulvestrant (Pure Estrogen Receptor Antagonist)</h4>
                        <p>Fulvestrant, a pure estrogen receptor antagonist, is approved for treatment of breast cancer, but not for prevention.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to tamoxifen and other SERMs, fulvestrant poses no risk of endometrial cancer, and only a slight risk of thromboembolism.</p>
