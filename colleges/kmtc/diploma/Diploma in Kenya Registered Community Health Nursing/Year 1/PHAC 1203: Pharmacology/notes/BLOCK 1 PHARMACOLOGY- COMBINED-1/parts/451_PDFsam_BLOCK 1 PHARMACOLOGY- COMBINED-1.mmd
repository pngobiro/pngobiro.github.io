\section*{DRUGS FOR H. pylori ERADICATION}
- A combination therapy is used in H.pylori associated ulcers for complete eradication.
* PPI + clarithromycin + amoxicillin/metronidazole.
* i.e The standard therapy is a one week triple therapy consisting of a proton pump inhibitor such as Omeprazole and the antibiotics Clarithromycin and Amoxicillin

B: AN(IIEMEIIC AGEN(IS
- Vomiting is controlled by vomiting centre in brainstem (rich in serotonin, histamine $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ receptors)
- Input to the vomiting centre comes from:
- Chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), rich in dopamine \&serotonin receptors.
- Vestibular system
- Irritation of pharynx (via vagus nerve)
- Irritation of GIT mucosa (via serotonin receptors)

NB: Antiemetics block this input to the vomiting centre.

\section*{1: DOPAMINE $\mathrm{D}_{2}$-RECEPTORS BLOCKERS.}
E.g. Chlorpromazine, metoclopromide, Domperidone, haloperidol, prochlorperazine.
Adm: per oral or parenterally.

\section*{Uses:}
- Post-operative nausea \& vomiting.
- Intractable hiccup (chlorpromazine)
- Chemotherapy induced nausea \& vomiting.

\section*{S/E:}

- Extrapyramidal syndrome.

\section*{2: SEROTONIN 5-HT3-RECEPTOR BLOCKERS.}
E.g. ondansetron and granisetron

- Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting
4. ANTIMUSCARINIC AGENTS
E.g. scopolamine, hyoscine

Uses: Prevention of motion sickness (taken before travelling)
5. ANTIHISTAMINES

e.g. hyoscyamine, dicyclomine.

Mxn: inhibition of muscarinic receptors in intestinal smooth muscle.
Use: relief of abdominal spasms \& cramps.
S/E: dry mouth, visual disturbances, urinary retention, constipation.

\section*{Laxatives}
- Laxatives are foods, compounds, and/or drugs that facilitate or increase bowel movements.
- They are most often used to treat constipation
- Laxatives contain chemicals that help increase stool motility, bulk, and frequency -- thus relieving temporary constipation

\section*{Types of Laxatives}
- Include pills, capsules, and liquids; suppositories; and enemas.

\section*{Bulking Agents (Fiber)}
- Fiber is the laxative most clinicians recommend for normal and slowtransit constipation.
- Fiber is naturally available in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
- Fiber is also available over the counter in Metamucil, Fiber-Lax, Benefiber

\section*{Lubricant Laxatives}
- Lubricant laxatives make stools slippery.
- The mineral oil within these products adds a slick layer to the intestine's walls and stops the stool from drying out.
- Lubricant laxatives are best used as a short-term cure for constipation.

\section*{Stimulant Laxatives}
- This type of laxative works by stimulating the lining of the intestine, thereby accelerating the stool's journey through the colon.
- Stimulant laxatives also increase a stool's hydration.

\section*{Antidiarrheal Medications}
- An antidiarrheal is a drug that is used to slow down or stop loose stools (diarrhea).
Types of antidiarrheal medications:
- Imodium (loperamide)- decreases the speed and number of intestinal contractions, thereby curbing diarrhea.
- Side effects of loperamide can include abdominal pain, dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.
Â© Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate)- slows diarrhea because it restricts the amount of water entering the bowels.
- Side effects of Pepto-Bismol include constipation, black stools, or a black tongue.
- Overdoses of Pepto-Bismol can be dangerous, so only take the prescribed amount and don't double up doses.

RESPIRATORY SYSTEM DRUGS
1. Bronchodilators
2. Corticosteroids (steroids)

\section*{1. BRONCHODILATORS}
-Also called relievers
-Mainly used in Asthma \& Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
a). Sympathomimetic agents.
- The most commonly drugs are beta-2 agonists.
- Other drugs such as epinephrine \& ephedrine have largely been replaced by beta -2 agonists.
Effects
- Relax airway smooth muscle causing
(46) onchodilation.

\section*{Beta- $_{2}$ agonists}
- All are derivatives of epinephrine.
*Short-acting: Albuterol, salbutamol, terbutaline, metaproterenol, and pirbuterol. Act within 30 mins .

\section*{Long-acting: Salmeterol and}

Formoterol. They are highly lipid soluble with a duration of action $>12 \mathrm{hrs}$.

Adm: inhalation (metered dose inhaler), Nebulization therapy, per oral (tablets).
- Albuterol and terbutaline tablets are
(46) varilable while terbutaline can also be ${ }^{\text {pm }}$

\section*{b). Methylxanthine drugs}
E.g. Theophylline (tea), Theobromine (cocoa), Caffeine(coffee). Administered per oral.
Effects:
- Causes smooth muscle relaxation.
- Inhibits histamine release and bronchoconstriction. USES:
- Reserved for non-responders to $\beta$-2 agonists and steroids.
- Theophylline is the most effective bronchodilator of them. It has a narrow (46) erapeutic window( $5-20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{l}$ ) hence ${ }^{11: 08 \mathrm{pm}}$

Systemic effects of methylxanthines
- CNS: insomnia, nervousness, seizures (especially caffeine)
- CVS: arrythmias.
- GIT: anorexia, increased acid secretion
- RENAL SYSTEM: diuresis
- RESP: smooth muscle relaxation.
c). Antimuscarinic agents

Mxn: Competitive inhibitors of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors blocking smooth muscle contraction and mucus secretion due to vagal stimulation.
ADM: intravenously (IV).
Atropine is the prototype. Derivatives include ipratropium bromide \& tiotropium.
NB: Generally they are less effective bronchodilator than $\beta 2$-agonists but the
(46) vougan be combined.

\section*{2. CORTCOSTEROIDS}
-Also called long term controllers of asthma..
Mxn: Inhibition of the lymphocytic, eosinophilic airway mucosal inflammation.
-Unlike $\beta$-agonists and theophylline, chronic use of inhaled steroids reduces bronchial reactivity.
Examples: Beclomethasone, triamcinolone, flunisolide,fluticasone, and budesonide, are lipid soluble. These are
(46) dministered by inhalation.

\section*{Corticosteroids.....}

Use: Long-term control of asthma, usually in combination with beta-2 agonists.

\section*{Side effects:}

Short-term: oropharyngeal candidiasis, hoarsness of voice.

\section*{Long-term: osteoporosis, cataract formation, slowing of growth in children.}

Other respiratory system drugs
* Cromolyn: it inhibits activation of mast cells and eosinophils.
* Leukotrene inhibitors: zileuton, Montelukast and panlukast.
- Inhibit synthesis of mediators of inflammation.
- All are administered orally.
- Used as a last resort in long-term control of asthma and COPD.

\section*{ANTI-HISTAMINES}

\section*{Introduction}
- Histamine exerts its effects through histamine receptors $\left(\mathrm{H}_{1}, \mathrm{H}_{2}, \mathrm{H}_{3} \& \mathrm{H}_{4}\right)$.
- General effects of histamine include:
- CNS: stimulant.
- CVS: hypotension, vasodilatation, tachycardia.
- RESP: bronchoconstriction
- GIT: gastric acid secretion, increase peristalsis.
- Anti-histamines block these receptors to produce their effects. Commonly used anti-histamines are $\mathrm{H}_{1} \& \mathrm{H}_{2}$.
a) Histamine-1 $\left(\mathrm{H}_{1}\right)$ antagonists
- E.g. diphenhydramine, cyclizine, meclizine, chlorpheniramine, promethazine, cetrizine.
Efects:
- Sedation, antiemetic, anti-allergy.

Uses:
- Allergic reactions-urticaria, allergic rhinitis.
- Motion sickness (promethazine, diphenhydramine)
- Nausea \& vomiting in pregnancy (morning sickness)
b) Histamine-2 ( $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ ) antagonists
- E.g. ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine.

Effect:
- Inhibits gastric acid secretion.

Uses:
- Peptic ulcer disease
- Gastro-Esophageal reflux disease (GERD).

General S/E of anti-histamines
${ }^{-}$Drowsiness, sedation, constipation.

\section*{RESUSCITATION DRUGS}
- During cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in advanced life support, drugs comes later after the use of oxygen \& ECG monitoring.
${ }^{-}$The main drugs used include: epinephrine, amiodarone, lidocaine, adenosene \& atropine.
* Epinephrine is widely used in CPR to:-
- Elevate BP, increase myocardial contractility \& heart rate, increase cerebral perfusion. Amiodarone: used to treat arryhthmias e.g. ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation.

\section*{*lidocaine}
- Used in managenment of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.
*Adenosine: used in supraventricular tachycardia. Has a short duration of action (< 2minutes).
Sodium hydrogen carbonate: used to correct metabolic acidosis
*Atropine: increases the heart rate by blocking the vagus nerve.
- Used in asystole when CPR \& other drugs have failed.

\section*{Routes of administration of resuscitation drugs.}
- All resuscitation drugs can be administered intravenously, endotracheal tube, intraosseous \& intracardiac route based on the situation.
