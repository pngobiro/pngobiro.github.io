\section*{(MAOIs)}

Mxn: inhibition of enzyme MAO causing an increase in noradrenaline, dopamine \& serotonin in the storage sites in CNS.
a).Irreversible nonselective MAOIs
e.g. Phenelzine, Tranylcypromine
b). Reversible Inhibitors of MAO
e.g. Maclobemide

\section*{S/E of MAOls}
- Dizziness, tiredness \& weakness
- Diarrhoea
- Unusual excitement or nervousness
- Tachycardia
- Dark urine, difficulty urinating
- Headache, blurred vision, difficulty sleeping.
- Decreased libido
- Cardiovascular disease, severe liver \& renal function impairment
Precaution:
- Pregnancy, lactation, paediatrics \& geriatrics.
- Use with care in suicidal patients

NB: avoid tyramine containing foods eg.alcohol, broad beans, chocolate, cream \& yoghurt, cheese.

\section*{II: ANTICONVULSANTS (ANTIEPILEPTIC) DRUGS}

Mechanisms of Action
- GABA potentiation: Diazepam, phenobarbitone, gabapentin, tiagabine, vigabatrin. Gamma-aminobutyric-acid ( GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that is found in great quantity in the brain
- Na+ ion channel block: Carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid, high doses of phenobarbitone.
${ }^{\bullet} \mathbf{C a}^{2+}$ ion channel block: ethosuximide \& valproic acid
- Glutamic acid antagonism:

Felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate. Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the

Classification of antiepileptics
- Older antiepileptics: Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide, phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproic acid
- Newer antiepileptics: Felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, tiagabine, topiramate, vigabatrin

\section*{CARBAMAZEPINE}

Adm: per oral.
Uses:
- Partial \& Tonic-clonic seizures.
- Also used in trigeminal neuralgia \& bipolar disorder.
Toxicities:
- CNS depression (diplopia,ataxia, drowziness)
- Hematotoxicity -agranulocytosis
- Liver enzyme inducer,
- Teratogenic.

PHENYTOIN
Adm: per oral with variable absorption
- Competition for plasma protein binding
- Induction of drug metabolizing enzymes.

Uses
- Partial \& tonic-clonic seizures.

Toxicities:
- CNS depression.
- Hirsutism, gingival hyperplasia, osteomalacia.
- Teratogenicity (craniofacial anomalies)

\section*{VALPROIC ACID}

Adm: per oral.
Uses: ("Broad spectrum" Antiepileptic drug)used in:
- Absence seizures
- Myoclonic, partial, \& tonic-clonic seizures.
- Also used in bipolar disorder \& migraine.

Toxicities:
- GI distress,
- Hepatotoxicity, inhibition of drug metabolism.
- Teratogenicity (spina bifida)

\section*{OTHER OLDER ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS.}

Clonazepam: Used in myoclonic seizures, anxiety states, bipolar disorder.
- Causes sedation \& dependence.

Ethosuximide: Only used in absence seizures.
- May cause GI distress, lethargy, headache.

Phenobarbital: Used in tonic-clonic seizures \& partial seizures.
- Causes CNS depression, dependence, liver enzyme induction.

\section*{NEWER ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS}
- Felbamate: Back- up in partial seizures \& myoclonic seizures.
- Gabapentin: Used in partial seizures, bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain, migraine
- Lamotrigine: Used in absence \& partial seizures, \& bipolar disorder.
- Vigabatrin: Back-up in partial seizures
- Topiramate, tiagabine: Back-up in partial seizures.

\section*{Treatment}
* Use a single drug whenever possible and increase its dose to either seizure control or toxicity.
*If a drug fails to control seizures, switch to another appropriate drug used alone and again increase the dose until seizure control occurs or toxicity intervenes.
* Use two drugs only when monotherapy has failed. Some patients may have more seizures when taking two drugs, compared with one drug, because of drug interactions.

General anaesthesia Concepts
- An Ideal Anaesthetic should cause unconsciousness, analgesia, amnesia, muscle relaxation and loss of reflexes.
- Anesthesia protocols involve use of:
- Premedication.
- Induction of anaesthesia: intravenous anesthetics.
- Maintainance of anaesthesia: inhaled anaesthetics and,
- Skeletal muscle relaxants.

Anesthesia
In the "old days" the following were used for anesthesia.

- Alcohol
- Drugs
- Ice for numbing
- Blow to the head
- Strangulation

system
- Respiratory system
Endocrine system
- Gl system
- Hepatic system
Cardiovascular system

\section*{Types of Anesthesia - General - Local}

\section*{Types of Anesthesia - General - Local}

\section*{General Anesthesia}
- Control sedation
- Reduce postoperative pain
- Provide amnesia
- Decrease anxiety

\section*{General Anesthesia}

Malignant Hyperthermia
- Side effect of anesthesia
- Fever of $42^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ or more
- Life threatening
- Treatment: dantrolene (Dantrium)

Warning! Always check

\section*{Premedication}
- Objectives are to: relief anxiety, reduce amount of secretions, reduce volume \& increase pH of gastric contents prior to surgery
Benzodiazepines: used to reduce anxiety.
- E.g. temazepam, midazolam, diazepam, lorazepam.
*Antimuscarinic agents: to reduce secretions.
- E.g. Atropine. Adm I.M or P.O.
$\% \mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{2}}$-receptor antagonists: to reduce gastric acidity. E.g. ranitidine.
NB: premedication is not commonly used nowadays.

\section*{Intravenous Anaesthetics}
- These agents are used to induce anaesthesia.
* Thiopental (barbiturate) has a rapid onset but short duration due to redistribution from the brain to other tissues. Causes hypotension, tissue damage on extravasation.
Midazolam is a benzodiapine with amnestic effects.
Fentanyl and related opioids have less Cardovascular actions than inhaled anesthetics. Recovery can be facilitated by naloxone.

\section*{Intravenous Anaesthetics}

Propofol: rapid onset. There is complete and rapid recovery from its effects. Also has antiemetic actions. Used for short procedures.
Causes pain on injection, hypotension.
* Ketamine causes "dissociative anesthesia." can be administered booth I.M \& I.V. produces minimal respiratory depression. Causes an increase in blood pressure.

\section*{Maintenance of anaesthesia}
- Agents used to maintain anaesthesia, administered by inhalation.
* Nitrous oxide: Incomplete anesthetic; rapid onset and recovery. Has analgesic effects.
Desflurane: Low volatility; poor induction agent; rapid recovery
Sevoflurane: Rapid onset and recovery; unstable in soda-lime
* Enflurane: Medium rate of onset and recovery
* Isoflurane: Medium rate of onset and recovery
* Halothane: Medium rate of onset and recovery.

Causes cardiac arrhythmias.

\section*{Muscle relaxants}
- Mainly used to: facilitate tracheal intubation, permit artificial ventilation \& relax muscles to make surgery possible.
- All act by blocking transmission at the neuromuscular junction.
- Two categories:

Depolarizing (non-competitive): succinylcholine (suxamethonium). Has a short duration of action ( $2-5 \mathrm{mins}$ ). Effect cannot be reversed by drugs.
* Non-depolarizing (competitive): pancuronium, tubocurarine, mivacurium, vecuronium, rocuronium. Effects can be reversed by neostigmine.
General S/E of muscle relaxants: Hyperkalemia,
41 Increased antracranial pressure, Muscle pain. 11:07 pm

\section*{Local Anesthesia}
- Relieves pain without altering alertness or mental function.
- Variety of Dosage Forms
- Topical
- Superficial injection (infiltration)
- Nerve block
- Epidural
- Spinal

\section*{Local Anesthesia}
- Short acting
- Metabolized in the plasma and tissue fluids
- Excreted in urine

\section*{Local Anesthesia}
- Longer acting
