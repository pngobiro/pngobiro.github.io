ANTIMYCOBACTERIAL AGENTS
5. ANTIMYCOBACTERIAL AGENTS
a) Drugs used in tuberculosis

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is difficult to treat due to:
- It has a characteristic lipid-rich cell wall (made of mycolic acid)
- Long duration of therapy
- Able to survive in macrophage hence greater inaccessibility to drugs
- Very slow growing
- Dormant states are very resistant to chemicals
5. ANTIMYCOBACTERIAL AGENTS.....
a) Drugs used in tuberculosis

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is difficult to treat due to:............
- Emergence of multi-drug resistant strains.
- The side effects associated with some drugs interfere with compliance.
- The association of TB with HIV/AIDS further weakens the immunity
- The nature of transmission: inhalation of droplets.

\section*{1st line anti-TB drugs-REFER}
