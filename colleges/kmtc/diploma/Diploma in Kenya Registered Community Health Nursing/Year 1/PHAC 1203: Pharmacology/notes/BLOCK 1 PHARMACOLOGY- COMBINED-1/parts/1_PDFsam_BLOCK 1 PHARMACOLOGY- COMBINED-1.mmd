\section*{Objectives}

By the end of the course, the student should be able to:
- State the rights of drugs administration
${ }^{-}$Adhere to the nursing considerations in drug administration
${ }^{-}$Classify the drugs and stating the MOA, indications, S/E, contraindications
- Describe how to monitor drugs toxicities
- Adhere to controlled drugs act while administering controlled drugs.

\section*{DEFINITION OF TERMS}

3. Splectrumarofactivity
${ }^{\text {©Bioavailability is defined as the fraction of unchanged }}$ drug reaching the systemic circulation following administration by any route.
${ }^{\text {- }}$ Pharmacokinetic: processes of absorption, distribution, and elimination determine how rapidly and for how long the drug will appear at the target organ.
${ }^{\bullet}$ Pharmacodynamics: drug effects and their mechanisms of action (effect)
${ }^{\text {- }}$ Half-life (t1/2): is the time required to change the amount of drug in the body by one-half during elimination (or during a constant infusion).
${ }^{\text {- }}$ First-pass elimination: Following absorption across the gut wall, the portal blood delivers the drug to the liver prior to entry into the systemic circulation
${ }^{\text {- }}$ Clearance, the measure of the ability of the body to eliminate the drug.
${ }^{\bullet}$ Therapeutic index : One measure, which relates the dose of a drug required to produce a desired effect to that which produces an undesired (toxic) effect.

Present-Day Pharmacology Practice

Medicinal Drugs
- Pharmacologic effects
- Drug actions on living system
- Classifications

Therapeutic drugs: relieve symptoms of a disease Prophylactic drugs: used to prevent or decrease the severity of disease

Present-Day Pharmacology
Practice
Pharmacognosy
- Study and identification of natural sources for drugs
${ }^{\text {- }}$ plants, animals, minerals, chemicals, recombinant DNA
- Biopharmaceuticals
- Produced by recombinant DNA technology

- New Drug Application (NDA)
- 1951, Durham-Humphrey Amendment
- Legend drug

\section*{Controlled Substances}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Label & Abuse Potential \\
\hline C-I & highest potential \\
\hline C-II & high possibility, which can lead to severe dependence \\

\section*{Receptors}
- A receptor is a protein molecule on the surface of or within a cell that recognizes and binds with specific molecules, thereby producing some effect within the cell.

\section*{Receptors}
- A receptor is a protein molecule on the surface of or within a cell that recognizes and binds with specific molecules, thereby producing some effect within the cell.
- receptor site may have specificity
- the affinity is the strength by which a particular chemical messenger binds to its receptor site or cell

\section*{Mechanisms of Drug Action}

Agonist
An agonist is a drug that binds to a particular receptor site and triggers the cell's response in a manner similar to the action of the body's own chemical messenger.
Chemical
messengers........Neurotransmitters.
Examples; Serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, gaba among others.

Mechanisms of Drug Action Antagonist

An antagonist is a drug that binds to a receptor site and blocks the action of the endogenous messenger or other drugs.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}
- Activity of a drug within the body over a period of time.
- ADME(Absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination).

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}
- Activity of a drug within the body over a period of time
- Includes ADME
- absorption
- distribution
- metabolism
- elimination

Pharmacokinetics
}

Absorption
Process whereby the drug enters the circulatory system

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

\section*{Distribution}

Process by which a drug moves from the blood into other body fluids( blood, lymph and CSF) and tissues and ultimately to its sites of action.

Blood flow is the rate-limiting factor.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

\section*{Metabolism}

Process by which drugs are chemically converted to compounds and then excreted through metabolic pathways.

\section*{Induction Inhibition}

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Elimination
Clearance is the rate at which a drug is eliminated from a specific volume of blood per unit of time.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

\section*{Dose-Response Curve}
