S/E: hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, dehydraton, hypomagnesemia.
C/I:allergy to sulphonamides, anuria, early in pregnancy.

\section*{3. Thiazide diuretics}
e.g. hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), chlorothiazide, metalazone.

C/I: hepatic cirrhosis, renal failure.

\section*{4. Potassium sparing diuretics}
E.g. spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride.

Mxn: antagonise the effects of aldosterone at late DCT \& collecting tubules.
Uses: (usually combined with other diuretics to prevent hypokalemia)
- hyperaldosteronism, hypokalemia.

S/E: hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, gynecomastia, acute renal failure, kidney stones.
C/I: chronic renal insufficiency.

\section*{5. Osmotic diuretics}

Use: (rarely used in hypertension)
- To reduce intracranial pressure
- Glaucoma (to reduce intraocular pressure)

S/E: dehydration, hyperkalemia, hypernatremia.

\section*{2. DRUGS USED IN HEART FAILURE}

\section*{a) Diuretics}

\section*{Effects:}
- Reduce extracellular fluid volume and preload.
- Control congestive symptoms \& improve exercise capacity
NB: Generally used in combination with other drugs.

\section*{b) Vasodilators}
- Generally vasodilators reduce the workload of the heart by reducing both the preload \& afterload.
- Arterial vasodilators reduce afterload i.e peripheral vascular resistance
- Venodilators reduce the preload i.e. the venous return.
- Venodilators \& arterial dilators reduce both preload and afterload.
- NB: a general side effect is postural hypotension.

\section*{c) Beta blockers( beta-receptor antagonists)}

Effects:
- Slow down the heart rate
- Decrease the force of contraction
- Prevent remodeling such as hypertrophy of ventricular walls.
NB: Usually combined with diuretics or ACE inhibitors.

\section*{d) Cardiac glycosides (digitalis) e.g. Digoxin.}

Mxn: inhibit Na/K ATPase reducing the transmembrane Na gradient that drives Ca out of the cell.

\section*{Effects:}
- Increases contractility (positive inotropism)
- Decrease automaticity \& AVN conduction.

\section*{Uses}
- Heart failure in atrial fibrillation
* Usually added to diuretics, ACE inhibitors, \&

Dose: $0.125-0.25 \mathrm{mg}$ OD. (PO).
Toxicity
- Sinus bradycardia
- Sino-atrial arrest
- Hyperkalemia
- Heart block

NB: it has a narrow therapeutic index hence requires ECG \& electrolyte monitoring.
Assignment: signs of toxicity for digoxin and nursing considerations for a patient on digoxin
3. DRUGS USED IN ANGINA PECTORIS
- Angina is a vice-like chest pain caused by accumulation of metabolites resulting from myocardial ischemia.
a) Nitrates: Nitroglycerine is the prototype drug. Its derivatives include:
- Isosorbide dinitrate (sublingual; per oral)
- Isosorbide mononitrate (sublingual; per oral)
- Amyl nitrate (inhalant)
- Mxn: converted to nitric oxide which induces smooth muscle relaxation \& vasodilatation especially coronary arteries.

Short acting: act within $5-30 \mathrm{mins}$, for immediate effect. Sublingual administration \& inhalation is used.

Long acting: act within hours, for long term use.
b) Other drugs used in angina.
- Calcium channel blockers e.g. amlodipine, nifedipine, felodipine.
- Beta-blockers e.g. metoprolol, carvedilol, esmolol.

\section*{4. Drugs Used In Dyslipidemia}
- Low density (LDL) \& very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) are rich in cholesterol and triglycerides -associated with cardiac diseases \& atherosclerosis.
- High density lipoproteins (HDL) facilitate transport of cholesterol \& triglycerides for metabolism in the liver hence they have a beneficial role.
NB: Drugs used either lower the levels of VLDL \& LDL or increase the levels of HDL.

\section*{a).HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ("statins")}
- E.g. simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin.
Mxn: inhibit HMG-CoA reductase which
catalyses the initial steps in cholesterol synthesis.
Effect: reduces LDL, small increase in HDL.
Adm: per oral with evening meal.
S/E: Rhabdomyolysis, myopathy, hypersensitivity reactions.
C/I: pregnancy \& lactation, hypersensitivity, impaired liver or renal function, children less

\section*{b).Fibric acid derivatives ("fibrates")}
- E.g. fenofibrate, gemfibrozil.

Mxn: increase lysis of triglycerides.
Effects: decrease VLDL levels; moderate increase in HDL.
Adm: per oral with food.
S/E: rashes, GIT upset, myopathy, arrhythmias, hypokalemia, gall stones.
Use with caution in: biliary tract diseases, hepatic \& renal failure.
c).Inhibitors of intestinal streol absorption
- E.g. ezetimibe

Mxn: inhibits intestinal absorption of cholesterol and triglycerides.
Effect: lowers LDL by 18\%.
Adm: per oral and with food.
S/E: reversible liver impairment, myositis.
d). Bile acid binding resins ("resins")
- E.g. colestipol, cholestyramine

Mxn: Bind bile acids in the intestines hence increasing hepatic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids.
Effect: reduce cholesterol content of LDL.
Adm: per oral \& with food.
S/E: constipation, bloating, Heart burn, diarrhea, steatorrhea.
D/I: cause impaired absorption of digoxin, warfarin, thiazides, tetracyclines.
*Anti-depresants
*Anticonvulsants

\section*{I: ANTI-DEPRESSANTS}
- All current antidepressants affect the serotonin and/or noradrenaline systems in the brain.
- Their effect on monoamine availability is immediate, but the clinical response occurs after about 3 weeks.
- About 10\% of depression becomes chronic \& requires regular follow up.

- Seizures (clomipramine \& maproptiline)
- CVS: hypotension, tachycardia,
- Decreased libido, orgasmic dysfunction in females.
- Weight gain (increased appetite)
- Blurred vision, dry mouth, aggravation of glaucoma, urinary retention
- CNS: agitation, confusion, memory lapse, hallucinations.
