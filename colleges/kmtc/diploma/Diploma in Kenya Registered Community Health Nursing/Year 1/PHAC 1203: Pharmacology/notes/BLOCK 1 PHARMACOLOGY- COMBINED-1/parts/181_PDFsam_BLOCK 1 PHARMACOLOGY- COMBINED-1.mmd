\section*{Stages of Viral Infection}
1. Virus attaches to a cell receptor.
2. Cell membrane indents and closes around the virus, thus the virus penetrates the cell.

\section*{Stages of Viral Infection}
1. Virus attaches to a cell receptor.
2. Cell membrane indents and closes around the virus, thus the virus penetrates the cell.
3. Virus escapes into cytoplasm.
4. Virus uncoat, shedding its covering and releasing DNA or RNA into cell nucleus.

\section*{Viruses are intracellular parasites.}

HIV belongs to a group of viruses known as retroviruses, which carry their genetic material in the form of ribonucleic acid (RNA) rather than deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

1. Attachment. In this first step, the GP120 and GP41 glycoproteins of HIV bind with the host's uninfected CD4 receptor and chemokine co-receptors which results in fusion of HIV with the CD4 T-cell membrane.
2. Uncoating. The contents of HIV's viral core (two single strands of viral RNA and three viral enzymes: reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease) are emptied into the CD4 T-cell.

DNA synthesis. HIV changes its genetic material from RNA to DNA through action of reverse transcriptase, resulting in double-stranded DNA that carries instruction for viral replication.
4. Integration. New viral DNA enters the nucleus of the CD4 T cell and through action of integrase is blended with the DNA of the CD4 T cell, resulting in permanent, lifelong infection.

NB-Prior to this step, the uninfected person has been only exposed to, not infected with, HIV. With this step, HIJV infection is permanent.

Transcription. When the CD4 T cell is activated, the double-stranded DNA forms single-stranded messenger RNA (mRNA), which builds new viruses.
6. Translation. The mRNA creates chains of new proteins and enzymes (polyproteins) that contain the components needed in the construction of new viruses.
-Polyprotein chain into the individual proteins that make up the new virus.
8. Budding. New proteins and viral RNA migrate to the membrane of the infected CD4 T cell, exit from the cell, and start the process all over.

\section*{AN(IIREIROVIRALS (ARVs)}

Ulses: HIV infection
1. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs): Inhibit the action of reverse transcriptase to prevent the formation of viral RNA from proviral DNA. Cause a decrease in the amount of virus in the body and subsequent spread to other healthy cells.
2. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) : Inhibit the action of HIV reverse transcriptase but at a different site on the enzyme than the site targeted by NRTIs
3. Protease inhibitors: Inhibit the protease enzyme, which typically cleaves certain HIV protein precursors that are necessary for the replication of new infectious virons
4. Entry inhibitors - fusion inhibitors (Enfuriartide) *- Prevents AIDS virus from entering the immune cells.

\section*{3. PROTEASE INHIBITORS}

\section*{General properties of protease inhibitors}

\section*{Adm: oral}

\section*{Abs:}
- Saquinavir (take with fatty food to enhance absorption)
- Indivavir - take on empty stomach for maximum absorption.
- Ritonavir - absorption increased with food
- Nelfinavir - absorption increased with food
- Amprenavir - rapid absorption (with or without food, high fat food decreases absorption).

\section*{Protease inhibitors}

Distribution: saquinavir -wide but does not enter CSF.
- Indinavir - achieves effective concentration in the CSF.
Elimination: all excreted via bile.
- All are inhibitors of cyp P450 enzymes hence they increase concentration of drugs e.g. benzodiazepines

\section*{CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY}

Cancer cells are characterized by persistent proliferation, invasive growth, and the ability to form metastases.
- Cancer can be treated with three basic modalities: surgery, radiation therapy, and drug therapy.
- Agents used for drug therapy fall into two main groups (1) cytotoxic agents and (2) noncytotoxic agents, such as hormones, immunomodulators, and targeted drugs.

Surgery and/or irradiation are the treatments of choice for most solid tumors.
- Drugs are the treatment of choice for disseminated cancers (leukemias, disseminated lymphomas, widespread metastases).
Drugs are also used as adjuvants to surgery and irradiation to kill malignant cells that surgery and irradiation leave behind.

\section*{CELL CYCLE}

The cell cycle has four major phases:
G1, in which cells prepare to synthesize DNA; $\boldsymbol{S}$, in which cells synthesize DNA;
G2, in which cells prepare for mitosis (division); and $\boldsymbol{M}$, in which cells actually divide.
Following mitosis, the resulting daughter cells may either enter G1 and repeat the cycle, or enter G0 and become mitotically dormant.
- The growth fraction of a tissue is defined as the ratio of proliferating cells to cells in G0.

The growth fraction of a tissue is defined as the ratio of proliferating cells to cells in G0.
- Tissues with a large percentage of proliferating cells and few cells in G0 have a high growth fraction.
Conversely, tissues composed mostly of G0 cells have a low growth fraction.
- Cytotoxic anticancer drugs are more toxic to cancers that have a high growth fraction than to cancers that have a low growth fraction.
Why? Because cytotoxic anticancer drugs are more active against proliferating cells than against cells in G0.
