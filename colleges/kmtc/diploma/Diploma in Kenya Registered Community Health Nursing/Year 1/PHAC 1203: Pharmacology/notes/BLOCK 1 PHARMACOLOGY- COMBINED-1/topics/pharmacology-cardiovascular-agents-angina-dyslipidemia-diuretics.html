                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Introduction to Diuretics: How Diuretics Work</h3>
                        <p>Most diuretics share the same basic mechanism of action: blockade of sodium and chloride reabsorption. By blocking the reabsorption of these prominent solutes, diuretics create osmotic pressure within the nephron that prevents the passive reabsorption of water. Hence, diuretics cause water and solutes to be retained within the nephron, and thereby promote the excretion of both.</p>
                        <p>The increase in urine flow that a diuretic produces is directly related to the amount of sodium and chloride reabsorption that it blocks.</p>
                        <p>Diuretics can cause hypovolemia (from excessive fluid loss), acid-base imbalance, and disturbance of electrolyte levels.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Classification of Diuretics</h3>
                        <p>There are four major categories of diuretic drugs (plus Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors):</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>High-ceiling (loop) diuretics (eg, furosemide);</li>
                            <li>Thiazide diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide);</li>
                            <li>Osmotic diuretics (eg, mannitol); and</li>
                            <li>Potassium-sparing diuretics.</li>
                            <li>Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide)</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1. HIGH-CEILING (LOOP) DIURETICS</h3>
                        <p>The high-ceiling agents are the most effective diuretics available. These drugs produce more loss of fluid and electrolytes than any other diuretics. Because their site of action is in the loop of Henle, the high-ceiling agents are also known as loop diuretics.</p>
                        <p>E.g. furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide, ethacrynic acid.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Furosemide</h4>
                        <p>Furosemide [Lasix] is the most frequently prescribed loop diuretic and will serve as our prototype for the group.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mechanism of Action:</strong> Furosemide acts in the thick segment of the ascending limb of Henle's loop to block reabsorption of sodium and chloride. By blocking solute reabsorption, furosemide prevents passive reabsorption of water. Since a substantial amount (20%) of filtered NaCl is normally reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, interference with reabsorption here can produce profound diuresis.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pharmacokinetics:</strong> Furosemide can be administered orally, IV, and IM. With oral administration, diuresis begins in 60 minutes and persists for 8 hours. Oral therapy is used when rapid onset is not required. Effects of intravenous furosemide begin within 5 minutes and last for 2 hours. Intravenous therapy is used in critical situations (eg, pulmonary edema) that demand immediate mobilization of fluid. Furosemide undergoes hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion.</p>
                        <p><strong>Therapeutic Uses:</strong> Furosemide drug should be avoided when less efficacious diuretics (thiazides) will suffice. Conditions that justify use of furosemide include (1) pulmonary edema associated with congestive heart failure (CHF); (2) edema of hepatic, cardiac, or renal origin that has been unresponsive to less efficacious diuretics; and (3) hypertension that cannot be controlled with other diuretics. Furosemide is especially useful in patients with severe renal impairment. Also used for hyperkalemia and acute renal failure.</p>
                        <p><strong>Adverse Effects:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hyponatremia, Hypochloremia, and Dehydration:</strong> Furosemide can produce excessive loss of sodium, chloride, and water. Severe dehydration can result. Signs of evolving dehydration include dry mouth, unusual thirst, and oliguria (scanty urine output). Impending dehydration can also be anticipated from excessive loss of weight. If dehydration occurs, furosemide should be withheld. Dehydration can promote thrombosis and embolism. Symptoms include headache and pain in the chest, calves, or pelvis. The risk of dehydration and its sequelae can be minimized by initiating therapy with low doses, adjusting the dosage carefully, monitoring weight loss every day, and administering furosemide on an intermittent schedule.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hypotension:</strong> Furosemide can cause a substantial drop in blood pressure. At least two mechanisms are involved: (1) loss of volume and (2) relaxation of venous smooth muscle, which reduces venous return to the heart. Signs of hypotension include dizziness, light headedness, and fainting. If blood pressure falls precipitously, furosemide should be discontinued. Because of the risk of hypotension, blood pressure should be monitored routinely. Outpatients should be taught to monitor their blood pressure and instructed to notify the prescriber if it drops substantially. Patients should be informed about symptoms of postural hypotension (dizziness, light-headedness) and advised to sit or lie down if these occur. Patients should be taught that postural hypotension can be minimized by getting up slowly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hypokalemia:</strong> Potassium is lost through increased secretion in the distal nephron. If serum potassium falls below 3.5 mEq/L, fatal dysrhythmias may result. Hypokalemia can be minimized by consuming potassium-rich foods (eg, dried fruits, nuts, spinach, citrus fruits, potatoes, bananas), taking potassium supplements, or using a potassium-sparing diuretic.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ototoxicity:</strong> Rarely, loop diuretics cause hearing impairment. With furosemide, deafness is transient. With ethacrynic acid (another loop diuretic), irreversible hearing loss has occurred. The ability to impair hearing is unique to the high-ceiling agents; diuretics in other classes are not ototoxic. Because of the risk of hearing loss, caution is needed when high-ceiling diuretics are used in combination with other ototoxic drugs (eg, aminoglycoside antibiotics).</li>
                            <li><strong>Hyperglycemia:</strong> Elevation of plasma glucose is a potential, albeit uncommon, complication of furosemide therapy. Hyperglycemia appears to result from inhibition of insulin release. Increased glycogenolysis and decreased glycogen synthesis may also contribute. When furosemide is taken by a diabetic patient, he or she should be especially diligent about monitoring blood glucose content.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hyperuricemia:</strong> Elevation of plasma uric acid is a frequent side effect of treatment. For most patients, furosemide-induced hyperuricemia is asymptomatic. However, for patients predisposed to gout, elevation of uric acid may precipitate a gouty attack. Patients should be informed about symptoms of gout (tenderness or swelling in joints) and instructed to notify the prescriber if these develop.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use in Pregnancy:</strong> When administered to pregnant laboratory animals, high-ceiling diuretics have caused maternal death, abortion, fetal resorption, and other adverse effects. There are no definitive studies on loop diuretics during human pregnancy. However, given the toxicity displayed in animals, prudence dictates that pregnant women use these drugs only if absolutely required. (Also listed as C/I: early in pregnancy).</li>
                            <li>Other S/E from summary: nephrotoxicity, hypomagnesemia.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Drug Interactions:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Potassium-Sparing Diuretics:</strong> The potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene) can help counterbalance the potassium-wasting effects of furosemide, thereby reducing the risk of hypokalemia.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lithium:</strong> Lithium is used to treat bipolar disorder. In patients with low sodium, excretion of lithium is reduced. Hence, by lowering sodium levels, furosemide can cause lithium to accumulate to toxic levels. Accordingly, lithium levels should be monitored, and, if they climb too high, lithium dosage should be reduced.</li>
                        </ul>
                         <p><strong>C/I:</strong> allergy to sulphonamides, anuria.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. THIAZIDES AND RELATED DIURETICS</h3>
                        <p>The thiazide diuretics (also known as benzothiadiazides) have effects similar to those of the loop diuretics. Like the loop diuretics, thiazides increase renal excretion of sodium, chloride, potassium, and water. In addition, thiazides elevate plasma levels of uric acid and glucose (risk of hyperglycemia).</p>
                        <p>The principal difference between the thiazides and high-ceiling agents is that the maximum diuresis produced by the thiazides is considerably lower than the maximum diuresis produced by the high-ceiling drugs. In addition, whereas loop diuretics can be effective even when urine flow is scant, thiazides cannot.</p>
                        <p>E.g. hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), chlorothiazide, metalazone.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)</h4>
                        <p>Hydrochlorothiazide is the most widely used thiazide diuretic. Used in hypertension.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mechanism of Action:</strong> Hydrochlorothiazide promotes urine production by blocking the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the early segment of the distal convoluted tubule. Retention of sodium and chloride in the nephron causes water to be retained as well, thereby producing an increased flow of urine. Since only 10% of filtered sodium and chloride is normally reabsorbed at the site where thiazides act, the maximum urine flow these drugs can produce is lower than with the high-ceiling drugs. The ability of thiazides to promote diuresis is dependent on adequate kidney function. These drugs are ineffective when GFR is low (less than 15 to 20 mL/min). Hence, in contrast to the high-ceiling agents, thiazides cannot be used to promote fluid loss in patients with severe renal impairment.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pharmacokinetics:</strong> Diuresis begins about 2 hours after oral administration. Effects peak within 4 to 6 hours, and may persist up to 12 hours. Most of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine.</p>
                        <p><strong>Therapeutic Uses:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Essential Hypertension:</strong> The primary indication for hydrochlorothiazide is hypertension, a condition for which thiazides are often drugs of first choice. For many hypertensive patients, blood pressure can be controlled with a thiazide alone, although many other patients require multiple-drug therapy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Edema:</strong> Thiazides are preferred drugs for mobilizing edema associated with mild to moderate heart failure. They are also given to mobilize edema associated with hepatic or renal disease.</li>
                            <li><strong>Diabetes Insipidus:</strong> Diabetes insipidus is a rare condition characterized by excessive production of urine. In patients with this disorder, thiazides reduce urine production by 30% to 50%. The mechanism of this paradoxical effect is unclear.</li>
                            <li>Also used for nephrolithiasis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Adverse Effects:</strong> The adverse effects of thiazide diuretics are similar to those of the high-ceiling agents. In fact, with the exception that thiazides lack ototoxic actions, the adverse effects of the thiazides and loop diuretics are nearly identical.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hyponatremia, Hypochloremia, and Dehydration:</strong> Loss of sodium, chloride, and water can lead to hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and dehydration. It should be noted, however, that since the diuresis produced by thiazides is moderate, these drugs have a smaller impact on sodium, chloride, and water than do the loop diuretics. To evaluate fluid and electrolyte status, electrolyte levels should be determined periodically, and the patient should be weighed on a regular basis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hypokalemia:</strong> Like the high-ceiling diuretics, the thiazides can cause hypokalemia from excessive potassium excretion. Potassium levels should be measured periodically, and, if serum potassium falls below 3.5 mEq/L, treatment with potassium supplements or a potassium-sparing diuretic should be instituted. Hypokalemia can be minimized by eating potassium-rich foods.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use in Pregnancy and Lactation:</strong> The thiazides have direct and indirect effects on the developing fetus. By reducing blood volume, thiazides can decrease placental perfusion, and may thereby compromise fetal nutrition and growth. Furthermore, thiazides can cross the placental barrier. Potential effects include electrolyte imbalance, hypoglycemia, jaundice, and hemolytic anemia. Thiazides should not be used routinely during pregnancy. Edema of pregnancy is not an indication for diuretic therapy, except when severe.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hyperglycemia:</strong> Like the loop diuretics, the thiazides can elevate plasma levels of glucose. Significant hyperglycemia develops only in diabetic patients, who should be especially diligent about monitoring blood glucose. To maintain normal glucose levels, the diabetic patient may require larger doses of insulin or an oral hypoglycemic drug.</li>
                            <li>Other S/E from summary: allergic reactions, impotence.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. POTASSIUM-SPARING DIURETICS</h3>
                        <p>The potassium-sparing diuretics can elicit two potentially useful responses. First, they produce a modest increase in urine production. Second, they produce a substantial decrease in potassium excretion. Because their diuretic effects are limited, the potassium-sparing drugs are rarely employed alone to promote diuresis. However, because of their marked ability to decrease potassium excretion, these drugs are often used to counteract potassium loss caused by thiazide and loop diuretics.</p>
                        <p>There are two subcategories of potassium-sparing diuretics: aldosterone antagonists and Non-aldosterone antagonists. Aldosterone antagonist‚Äîspironolactone‚Äîis used for diuresis. Two non-aldosterone antagonists‚Äîtriamterene and amiloride.</p>
                        <p>E.g. spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mxn (general):</strong> antagonise the effects of aldosterone at late DCT & collecting tubules.</p>
                        <p><strong>Uses (general):</strong> (usually combined with other diuretics to prevent hypokalemia), hyperaldosteronism, hypokalemia.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Spironolactone</h4>
                        <p><strong>MOA:</strong> Spironolactone [Aldactone] blocks the actions of aldosterone in the distal nephron. Since aldosterone acts to promote sodium uptake in exchange for potassium secretion, inhibition of aldosterone has the opposite effect: retention of potassium and increased excretion of sodium. The diuresis caused by spironolactone is scanty because most of the filtered sodium load has already been reabsorbed by the time the filtrate reaches the distal nephron. The effects of spironolactone are delayed, taking up to 48 hours to develop. Why the delay? Recall that aldosterone acts by stimulating cells of the distal nephron to synthesize the proteins required for sodium and potassium transport. By preventing aldosterone's action, spironolactone blocks the synthesis of new proteins, but does not stop existing transport proteins from doing their job. Hence, effects are not visible until the existing proteins complete their normal life cycle-a process that takes 1 or 2 days.</p>
                        <p><strong>Therapeutic Uses:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hypertension and Edema:</strong> Spironolactone is used primarily for hypertension and edema. Although it can be employed alone, the drug is used most commonly in combination with a thiazide or loop diuretic. The purpose of spironolactone in these combinations is to counteract the potassium-wasting effects of the more powerful diuretics. Spironolactone also makes a small contribution to diuresis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Heart Failure:</strong> In patients with severe heart failure, spironolactone greatly reduces mortality and hospital admissions. Benefits derive from protective effects of aldosterone blockade in the heart and blood vessels.</li>
                            <li><strong>Other Uses:</strong> In addition to the applications discussed above, spironolactone can by used for primary hyperaldosteronism, premenstrual syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome, and acne in young women.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Adverse Effects:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hyperkalemia:</strong> The potassium-sparing effects of spironolactone can result in hyperkalemia, a condition that can produce fatal dysrhythmias. Although hyperkalemia is most likely when spironolactone is used alone, it can also develop when spironolactone is used in conjunction with potassium wasting agents (thiazides and high-ceiling diuretics). If serum potassium rises above 5 mEq/L, or if signs of hyperkalemia develop (eg, abnormal cardiac rhythm), spironolactone should be discontinued and potassium intake restricted. Injection of insulin can help lower potassium levels by promoting potassium uptake into cells.</li>
                            <li><strong>Benign and Malignant Tumors:</strong> When given long term to rats in doses 25 to 250 times those used in humans, spironolactone caused benign adenomas of the thyroid and testes, malignant mammary tumors, and proliferative changes in the liver. The risk of tumors in humans from use of normal doses is unknown.</li>
                            <li><strong>Endocrine Effects:</strong> Spironolactone is a steroid derivative with a structure similar to that of steroid hormones (eg, progesterone, estradiol, testosterone). As a result, spironolactone can cause a variety of endocrine effects, including gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities, impotence, hirsutism, and deepening of the voice.</li>
                            <li>Other S/E from summary: metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, kidney stones.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Drug Interactions:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Thiazide and Loop Diuretics:</strong> Spironolactone is frequently combined with thiazide and loop diuretics. The goal is to counteract the potassium-wasting effects of the more powerful diuretic.</li>
                            <li>Because of the risk of hyperkalemia, spironolactone must never be combined with potassium supplements, salt substitutes (which contain potassium chloride), or another potassium sparing diuretic.</li>
                            <li>In addition, three groups of drugs-angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and direct renin inhibitors-can elevate potassium levels.</li>
                        </ul>
                         <p><strong>C/I:</strong> chronic renal insufficiency.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Amiloride & Triamterene (Non-aldosterone antagonists)</h4>
                        <p>Amiloride has actions similar to those of triamterene. Drug inhibits potassium loss by direct blockade of sodium-potassium exchange in the distal nephron. Produces only modest diuresis. Although it can be employed alone as a diuretic, amiloride is used primarily to counteract potassium loss caused by more powerful diuretics (thiazides, high-ceiling agents). The major adverse effect is hyperkalemia. Accordingly, concurrent use of other potassium-sparing diuretics or potassium supplements must be avoided. Caution is needed if the drug is combined with an ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or direct renin inhibitor. Amiloride is available in a fixed-dose combination with hydrochlorothiazide under the trade name Moduretic.</p>
                        <p>(Triamterene mentioned with amiloride as an example of non-aldosterone antagonists and K-sparing diuretics in general).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4. OSMOTIC DIURETICS</h3>
                        <p>Four compounds-mannitol, urea, glycerin, and isosorbide‚Äîare classified as osmotic diuretics. However, of the four, only mannitol is used for its diuretic actions. The osmotic agents differ from other diuretics in both mechanism and indications.</p>
                        <p>E.g. Mannitol</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mannitol</h4>
                        <p>Mannitol is a simple six-carbon sugar that possesses the four properties characteristic of an osmotic diuretic:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is freely filtered at the glomerulus.</li>
                            <li>It undergoes minimal reabsorption.</li>
                            <li>It is not metabolized to a significant degree.</li>
                            <li>It is pharmacologically inert (ie, it has no direct effects on the biochemistry or physiology of cells).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Mechanism of Diuretic Action:</strong> Mannitol promotes diuresis by creating an osmotic force within the lumen of the nephron. Unlike other solutes, mannitol undergoes minimal reabsorption after filtration. As a result, most of the drug remains within the nephron, creating an osmotic force that inhibits passive reabsorption of water. The degree of diuresis produced is directly related to the concentration of mannitol in the filtrate; the more mannitol present, the greater the diuresis. Mannitol has no significant effect on the excretion of potassium and other electrolytes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Adm:</strong> I.V infusion.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pharmacokinetics:</strong> Mannitol does not diffuse across the GI epithelium and cannot be transported by the uptake systems that absorb dietary sugars. Accordingly, in order to reach the circulation, the drug must be given parenterally. Following IV injection, mannitol distributes freely to extracellular water. Diuresis begins in 30 to 60 minutes and persists 6 to 8 hours. Most of the drug is excreted intact in the urine.</p>
                        <p><strong>Therapeutic Uses:</strong> (rarely used in hypertension)</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Prophylaxis of Renal Failure:</strong> Under certain conditions (eg, dehydration, severe hypotension, hypovolemic shock), blood flow to the kidney is decreased, causing a great reduction in filtrate volume.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reduction of Intracranial Pressure:</strong> Intracranial pressure (ICP) that has been elevated by cerebral edema can be reduced with mannitol. The drug lowers ICP because its presence in the cerebral vasculature creates an osmotic force that draws edematous fluid out of the brain. There is no risk of increasing cerebral edema because mannitol cannot exit the capillary beds of the brain.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reduction of Intraocular Pressure:</strong> Mannitol and other osmotic agents can lower IOP. Mannitol reduces IOP by rendering the plasma hyperosmotic with respect to intraocular fluids, thereby creating an osmotic force that draws ocular fluid into the blood. Use of mannitol to lower IOP is reserved for patients who have not responded to more conventional treatment. (Also used for Glaucoma for this reason).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Adverse Effects:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Edema:</strong> Mannitol can leave the vascular system at all capillary beds except those of the brain. When the drug exits capillaries, it draws water along, causing edema. Mannitol must be used with extreme caution in patients with heart disease, since it may precipitate CHF and pulmonary edema. If signs of pulmonary congestion or CHF develop, use of the drug must cease immediately.</li>
                            <li><strong>Other Adverse Effects:</strong> Common responses include headache, nausea, and vomiting. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance may also occur. (Also listed: dehydration, hyperkalemia, hypernatremia from summary).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Mxn:</strong> inhibit carbonic anhydrase in the PCT, blocking reabsorption of $\text{NaHCO}_3$. E.g. acetazolamide.</p>
                        <p><strong>Uses:</strong> (rarely used in hypertension). Glaucoma, metabolic alkalosis.</p>
                        <p><strong>S/E:</strong> renal stone formation, hypokalemia, paresthesias, metabolic acidosis.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Key Points on Diuretics</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>More than 99% of the water, electrolytes, and nutrients that are filtered at the glomerulus undergo reabsorption.</li>
                            <li>Most diuretics block active reabsorption of sodium and chloride, and thereby prevent passive reabsorption of water.</li>
                            <li>The amount of diuresis produced is directly related to the amount of sodium and chloride reabsorption blocked.</li>
                            <li>Drugs that act early in the nephron are in a position to block the greatest amount of solute reabsorption, and hence produce the greatest diuresis.</li>
                            <li>High-ceiling diuretics (loop diuretics) block sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle.</li>
                            <li>High-ceiling diuretics produce the greatest diuresis.</li>
                            <li>In contrast to thiazide diuretics, high-ceiling diuretics are effective even when the glomerular filtration rate is low.</li>
                            <li>High-ceiling diuretics can cause dehydration through excessive fluid loss.</li>
                            <li>High-ceiling diuretics can cause hypotension by decreasing blood volume and relaxing venous smooth muscle.</li>
