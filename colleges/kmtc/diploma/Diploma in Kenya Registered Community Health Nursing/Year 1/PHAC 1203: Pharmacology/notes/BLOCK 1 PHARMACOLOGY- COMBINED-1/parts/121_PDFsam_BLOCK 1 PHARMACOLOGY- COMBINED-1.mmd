S. mansoni infection.

Protozoa are microscopic, one-celled organisms that can be free-living or parasitic in nature.
Transmission of protozoa that live in a human's intestine to another human typically occurs through a fecal-oral route (for example, contaminated food or water or person-toperson contact).
Protozoa that live in the blood or tissue of humans are transmitted to other humans by an arthropod vector (for example, through the bite of a mosquito or sand fly).

\section*{ANTI-PROTOZOAL AGENTS \\ AMOEBIASIS (E. histolytica)}
- Trophozoites and cysts are involved.
- Trophozoites can invade colon epithelium causing ulceration; can spread to liver.
- Trophozoites can simply live on gut bacteria thus broadspectrum antiobiotic can eradicate them. Range of illness/symptoms
- Asymptomatic carrier
- Mild diarrhea
- Fulminant dysentery
1. Metronidazole \& Tinidazole
- Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole antibiotic medication used particularly for anaerobic bacteria and protozoa.
- Metronidazole is an antibiotic, amebicide, and antiprotozoal.
- Tinidazole is a synthetic antiprotozoal and antibacterial agent.
Mxn: the drug is reduced to reactive products toxic to DNA \& proteins- producing cidal activity.
Administration: oral, parenteral
Absorption: complete \& rapid
Distribution: well into all tissues (including saliva, breast milk)
Elimination: Metabolized in liver then excretion by renal route.

\section*{Metronidazole \& Tinidazole.....}
