\section*{ANALGESICS A). OPIOID (NARCOTIC) ANALGESICS B). NON-STERODALANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDS)}

Pain Management
What is pain?
- A protective mechanism to warn of damage or the presence of disease
- Part of the normal healing process

\section*{Pain Management Natural Opioids}
- Endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins
- Produced by the brain in response to pain stimuli
- When receptors are activated
- causes decreased nerve transmission
- sensation of pain is diminished
- Opioids bind to these same receptors

\section*{Major Sources of Pain}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Source & Area Involved & Characteristics & Treatment \\
\hline Somatic & body framework & throbbing, stabbing & narcotics, NSAIDS \\
\hline Visceral & kidneys, intestines, liver & aching, throbbing, sharp, crampy & narcotics, NSAIDS \\
\hline Neuropathic & Nerves & burning, numbing, tingling & antidepressants, anticonvulsants \\
\hline Sympathetically Mediated & overactive sympathetic system & no pain should be felt & nerve blockers \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{A). OPIOID ANALGESICS}
- Mainly act by binding to mu ( $\mu$ ) receptors(opioid receptors) in the CNS.
- Classified as agonists, partial agonists and antagonists.
Agonists:
- Strong agonists: Morphine(10-20mg P.O/IV), pethidine ( $50-100 \mathrm{mg}$ IM PRN), methadone (510 mg TDS/QID P.O).
- Moderate agonists: Oxycodone, hydrocodone ( $30-60 \mathrm{mg}$ QID P.O)
- Weak agonist: Codeine ( $30-60 \mathrm{mg}$ QID PRN).

\section*{Opioid analgesics}
* Partial agonists: Nalbuphine, pentazocine
*Antagonists: naloxone, naltreoxone.
Pharmacological Effects
- Analgesia : Efficacy variable depending on the drug
- Sedation
- Respiratory depression
- GIT: Constipation secondary to decreased peristalsis
- Pupils - miosis (constriction)
- Cough suppression \& Emesis

\section*{Clinical uses}
- Analgesia - drug choice depends on need.
- Cough suppressants : codeine, dextromethorphan, dihydrocodeine.
- Diarrhoea : loperamide, diphenoxylate
- Anesthesia : fentanyl, morphine
- Withdrawal states:
- Methadone is used to suppress symptoms of opioid withdrawal
- Naltrexone is used to decrease craving in alcoholism.

\section*{General S/E}
- Bradycardia
- Confusion
- Constipation
- Dependence
- Dry mouth
- Nausea
- Sedation
- Urinary retention
- Hallucinations \& nightmares.
B). NSAIDS

Mxn: inhibit enzyme Cyclo-oxygenase 1 (COX1) \& Cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2), hence inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.
- Cyclooxygenase (COX), is an enzyme that is responsible for formation of important biological mediators called prostanoids, including prostaglandins, prostacyclin and thromboxane.
- Pharmacological inhibition of COX can provide relief from the symptoms of inflammation and pain.
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, exert their effects through inhibition of COX.
tramadol (Ultram)
- High success rate when given with NSAIDs (ibuprofen)
- Has slow onset of action
- Is not a controlled substance, but has shown potential for addiction

\section*{NSAIDS}

Therapeutic effect: analgesia, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory.
Classification:
- Non-selective COX inhibitors
- Selective COX-2 inhibitors.

\section*{Non-selective COX inhibitors.}
E.g. diclofenac, fenoprofen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, piroxicam, meloxicam.
Uses: rheumatoid arthritis, gout, pain relief.
S/E: indigestion, gastric bleeding \& perforation, salt \& water retention, bronchospasm.
D/I: antagonise the actions of diuretics\& antihypertensive drugs
- Increase the effects of anticoagulants.

\section*{Selective COX-2 inhibitors}
E.g. celecoxib, rofecoxib.
- Selectively inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins that mediate inflammation hence they produce less of gastric ulceration.
Precaution on using NSAIDS:
- In liver disease, heart failure, renal disease or patients taking diuretics ( may precipitate kidney damage).

Other analgesics
- Salicylates
- (Acetaminophen) Paracetamol

\section*{Salicylates}
E.g. Asprin (acetylsalicylic acid)

Adm: per oral.
Elimination: metabolised in liver \& excreted in urine. Excretion is facilitated in alkaline urine.
Uses: pain relief, reduces platelet aggregation; used for an anti-inflammatory effect ; antipyretic in acute rheumatic fever.
S/E: gastric irritation, gastric bleeding
- At higher doses: dizziness, tinnitus, deafness, hyperventilation.
- risk for developing Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious syndrome of rapid liver degeneration and encephalopathy.
C/I: history of PUD, bleeding disorders, liver disease.
Treatment of asprin poisoning: gastric lavage, forced

Paracetamol (acetaminophen)
- The mechanism of analgesic action of acetaminophen is unclear. The drug is only a weak COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor in peripheral tissues, which accounts for its lack of anti-inflammatory effect.
Adm: per oral (tablet or syrup).
- Used to provide mild analgesia in children < 12 years.
S/E: uncommon at normal dosage
- In overdose-severe hepatotoxicity. Prompt administration of acetylcysteine, is lifesaving after an overdose. Alcoholics
(44) havèng anninchleased risk of paracetamol:08 pm
