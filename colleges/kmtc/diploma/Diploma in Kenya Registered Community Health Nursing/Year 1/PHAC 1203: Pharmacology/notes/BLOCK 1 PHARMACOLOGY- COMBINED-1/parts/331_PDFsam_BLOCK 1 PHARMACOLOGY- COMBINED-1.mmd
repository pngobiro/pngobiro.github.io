Hyperglycemia.
Like the loop diuretics, the thiazides can elevate plasma levels of glucose.
Significant hyperglycemia develops only in diabetic patients, who should be especially diligent about monitoring blood glucose.
To maintain normal glucose levels, the diabetic patient may require larger doses of insulin or an oral hypoglycemic drug.

\section*{POTASSIUM-SPARING DIURETICS}

The potassium-sparing diuretics can elicit two potentially useful responses.
First, they produce a modest increase in urine production.
Second, they produce a substantial decrease in potassium excretion.
Because their diuretic effects are limited, the potassium-sparing drugs are rarely employed alone to promote diuresis.
However, because of their marked ability to decrease potassium excretion, these drugs are often used to counteract potassium loss caused by thiazide and

\section*{Spironolactone MOA-}

Spironolactone [Aldactone] blocks the actions of aldosterone in the distal nephron.
Since aldosterone acts to promote sodium uptake in exchange for potassium secretion
The diuresis caused by spironolactone is scanty because most of the filtered sodium load has already been reabsorbed by the time the filtrate reaches the distal nephron.

The effects of spironolactone are delayed, taking up to 48 hours to develop. Why the delay?
Recall that aldosterone acts by stimulating cells of the distal nephron to synthesize the proteins required for sodium and potassium transport.
By preventing aldosterone's action, spironolactone blocks the synthesis of new proteins, but does not stop existing transport proteins from doing their job. Hence, effects are not visible until the existing proteins complete their normal life cycle-a process that takes 1 or 2 days.

\section*{Therapeutic Uses}

\section*{Hypertension and Edema.}

Spironolactone is used primarily for hypertension and edema.
Although it can be employed alone, the drug is used most commonly in combination with a thiazide or loop diuretic.
The purpose of spironolactone in these combinations is to counteract the potassium-wasting effects of the more powerful diuretics.
Spironolactone also makes a small contribution to diuresis.

\section*{Heart Failure.}

In patients with severe heart failure, spironolactone greatly reduces mortality and hospital admissions.
Benefits derive from protective effects of aldosterone blockade in the heart and blood vessels .
Other Uses.
In addition to the applications discussed above, spironolactone can by used for primary
hyperaldosteronism , premenstrual syndrome , polycystic ovary
syndrome , and acne in young women .

\section*{Adverse Effects Hyperkalemia.}

The potassium-sparing effects of spironolactone can result in hyperkalemia, a condition that can produce fatal dysrhythmias.
Although hyperkalemia is most likely when spironolactone is used alone, it can also develop when spironolactone is used in conjunction with potassium wasting agents (thiazides and high-ceiling diuretics).

If serum potassium rises above $5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, or if signs of hyperkalemia develop (eg, abnormal cardiac rhythm), spironolactone should be discontinued and potassium intake restricted. Injection of insulin can help lower potassium levels by promoting potassium uptake into cells.

\section*{Benign and Malignant Tumors.}

When given long term to rats in doses 25 to 250 times those used in humans, spironolactone caused benign adenomas of the thyroid and testes, malignant mammary tumors, and proliferative changes in the liver.
The risk of tumors in humans from use of normal doses is unknown.

\section*{Endocrine Effects.}

Spironolactone is a steroid derivative with a structure similar to that of steroid hormones (eg, progesterone, estradiol, testosterone).

As a result, spironolactone can cause a variety of endocrine effects, including gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities, impotence, hirsutism, and deepening of the voice.

Drug Interactions
Thiazide and Loop Diuretics.
Spironolactone is frequently combined with thiazide and loop diuretics.
The goal is to counteract the potassium-wasting effects of the more powerful diuretic.

\title{
Because of the risk of hyperkalemia, spironolactone must never be combined with potassium supplements, salt substitutes (which contain potassium chloride), or another potassium sparing diuretic.
}

In addition, three groups of drugs-angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and direct renin inhibitors-can elevate potassium

\section*{Amiloride}

Amiloride has actions similar to those of triamterene. Drug inhibits potassium loss by direct blockade of sodium-potassium exchange in the distal nephron. Produces only modest diuresis. Although it can be employed alone as a diuretic, amiloride is used primarily to counteract potassium loss caused by more powerful diuretics (thiazides, highceiling agents).

The major adverse effect is hyperkalemia. Accordingly, concurrent use of other potassium-sparing diuretics or potassium supplements must be avoided.
Caution is needed if the drug is combined with an ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or direct renin inhibitor.
Amiloride is available in a fixed-dose combination with hydrochlorothiazide under the trade name Moduretic.

\section*{Osmotic Diuretics}

Four compounds-mannitol, urea, glycerin, and isosorbide—are classified as osmotic diuretics.
However, of the four, only mannitol is used for its diuretic actions.
The osmotic agents differ from other diuretics in both mechanism and indications.

\section*{Mannitol}

Mannitol is a simple six-carbon sugar that possesses the four properties characteristic of an osmotic diuretic:

It is freely filtered at the glomerulus.
- It undergoes minimal reabsorption.
- It is not metabolized to a significant degree.
- It is pharmacologically inert (ie, it has no direct effects on the biochemistry or physiology of cells).

\section*{Mechanism of Diuretic Action}

Mannitol promotes diuresis by creating an osmotic force within the lumen of the nephron.
Unlike other solutes, mannitol undergoes minimal reabsorption after filtration.
As a result, most of the drug remains within the nephron, creating an osmotic force that inhibits passive reabsorption of water.

The degree of diuresis produced is directly related to the concentration of mannitol in the filtrate; the more mannitol present, the greater the diuresis.

Mannitol has no significant effect on the excretion of potassium and other electrolytes.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Mannitol does not diffuse across the GI epithelium and cannot be transported by the uptake systems that absorb dietary sugars.
Accordingly, in order to reach the circulation, the drug must be given parenterally.
Following IV injection, mannitol distributes freely to extracellular water.
Diuresis begins in 30 to 60 minutes and persists 6 to 8 hours. Most of the drug is excreted intact in the urine.

\section*{Therapeutic Uses}

\section*{1.Prophylaxis of Renal Failure}

Under certain conditions (eg, dehydration, severe hypotension, hypovolemic shock), blood flow to the kidney is decreased, causing a great reduction in filtrate volume.
2. Reduction of Intracranial Pressure.

Intracranial pressure (ICP) that has been elevated by cerebral edema can be reduced with mannitol.

The drug lowers ICP because its presence in the cerebral vasculature creates an osmotic force that draws edematous fluid out of the brain.

There is no risk of increasing cerebral edema because mannitol cannot exit the capillary beds of the brain.
3. Reduction of Intraocular Pressure.

Mannitol and other osmotic agents can lower IOP. Mannitol reduces IOP by rendering the plasma hyperosmotic with respect to intraocular fluids, thereby creating an osmotic force that draws ocular fluid into the blood.
Use of mannitol to lower IOP is reserved for patients who have not responded to more conventional treatment.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

\section*{Edema.}

Mannitol can leave the vascular system at all capillary beds except those of the brain.
When the drug exits capillaries, it draws water along, causing edema.
Mannitol must be used with extreme caution in patients with heart disease, since it may precipitate CHF and pulmonary edema.
If signs of pulmonary congestion or CHF develop, use of the drug must cease immediately.

Other Adverse Effects.
Common responses include headache, nausea, and vomiting.
Fluid and electrolyte imbalance may also occur.

\section*{Key Points}
- More than $99 \%$ of the water, electrolytes, and nutrients that are filtered at the glomerulus undergo reabsorption.
- Most diuretics block active reabsorption of sodium and chloride, and thereby prevent passive reabsorption of water.
- The amount of diuresis produced is directly related to the amount of sodium and chloride reabsorption blocked.

Drugs that act early in the nephron are in a position to block the greatest amount of solute reabsorption, and hence produce the greatest diuresis.
- High-ceiling diuretics (loop diuretics) block sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle.

High-ceiling diuretics produce the greatest diuresis.
- In contrast to thiazide diuretics, high-ceiling diuretics are effective even when the glomerular filtration rate is low.
- High-ceiling diuretics can cause dehydration through excessive fluid loss.
- High-ceiling diuretics can cause hypotension by decreasing blood volume and relaxing venous smooth muscle.
