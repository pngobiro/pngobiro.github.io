\section*{Drug Effects}

When choosing a drug for a patient, a healthcare practitioner considers:

Indications
The diseases, symptoms, and conditions for which the drug is known to be of benefit.
Contraindications
The diseases, symptoms, and conditions for which the drug will not be beneficial and may do harm.

Drug Effects
Side Effects
Secondary responses to a drug other than the primary therapeutic effect for which the drug was intended
- Allergic responses
- Drug dependence, addiction, abuse, and tolerance

\section*{Factors that Influence Drug Action}
- Age

Pediatric patients and elderly patients may need a reduced dose because of smaller size or inability of liver to metabolize medication
- Disease

Specific diseases may hinder the pharmacokinetic process of some drugs
- Mental State, Genes, Gender

Considerations for Pediatric Patients
- Wide variation between age and degree of organ-system development
- Reevaluate all doses at regular intervals.
- Be sure the dosage is appropriate for the child's age.
- Always double-check all computations.

\section*{A. CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS}
- Antibacterial agents
- Antifungal agents
- Antiviral agents
- Antihelminthic agents
- Antiprotozoa agents
- Anticancer agents
B. SYSTEMIC PHARMACOLOGY: DRUGS ACTING ON:-
- Cardiovascular system
- Respiratory system
- Gastro-intestinal system
- Central nervous system

CHEMOTHIERAPEUIIC AGEN(IS
- Definition: Substances/chemicals that kill or inhibit the growth of infective agents or cancerous cells in the body
- Antibiotics (Antibacterial agents)substances produced by microorganisms that in very dilute concentration kill or inhibit other microorganisms -
- The goal of this agents is to be toxic (kill or sufficiently inhibit growth of) to microorganism or cancerous tissue while being harmless (minimally) to the host or non-cancerous tissue

\section*{Terminologies}
1. Bactericidal vs bacteriostatic
a) Bacteriostatic - agents that inhibit the growth (replication) of the infective agent.
- The body requires an effective immune defense.
b) Bacteriocidal - agents that kills the sensitive infective agent. The body does not requires an effective immune system.
- These agents are indicated when host immune defense is impaired, in neutropenic patients (e.g. cancer) or in life threatening situations endocarditis, meningitis.

Bacteriocidal drugs exhibit either:-
- Concentration dependent killing - rate and extent of cidal activity increases with conc. of drug e.g. aminoglycosides, quinolones
- Time-dependent killing - rate and extent of killing is maximal above the minimum bactericidal conc. and does not increase beyond this.

\section*{2. Post-antibiotic effect}
- Persistent microbial suppression even after the plasma concentration of a drug falls below the minimum inhibitory concentration. e.g. aminoglycosides, quinolones.
3. Spectrum of a chemotherapeutic agent
- Narrow - sensitivity limited to a small group of organisms
- Broad - many groups of organism sensitive to the effect of that agent (often inclusive of both gram negative and positive. A common side effect is superinfection.

\section*{Thanks to PENICILLIN He Will Come Home! Second World War}
- The first antibiotic, penicillin, was discovered in 1929 by Sir Alexander Fleming, who observed inhibition of staphylococci on an agar plate contaminated by a Penicillium mold.
- He named the active substance penicillin but was unable to isolate it.

\section*{1.Infibitors of cell wall synthesis}

\section*{a). $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-LACTAM ANTIBACTERIALS}
- Mechanism of action: inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis.
- Active only in organisms whose cell wall is formed of peptidoglycan
- Require actively dividing cells

\section*{Classes of beta lactams}
-Penicillins
- Carbapenems
-Cephalosporins
- Monobactams

\section*{Beta lactam ring}

<smiles>[Z]C(=O)NC1C(=O)N2C(C(=O)O)C([R])CS[C@H]12</smiles>
- Beta Lactam ring-a cyclic 4atom structure of several antibiotics.
- $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-lactamase - several enzymes(upto 100), that hydrolyze the beta lactam ring leading to loss of activity/resistance.
- $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-lactamase inhibitors - Clavulanic acid, sulbactam, tazobactam
- These bind to and inactivate the $\beta$-lactamase enzyme
- They are combined with some penicillins to increase the spectrum to cover $\beta$-lactamase producing organisms. E.g.
Amoxicillin+clavulanic acid = Augmentin

- $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-Lactam antibiotics (beta-lactam antibiotics) are a broad class of antibiotics, consisting of all antibiotic agents that contains a $\beta$-lactam nucleus in their molecular structures.
- This includes penicillin derivatives ( penams), cephalosporins (cephems), monobactams, and carbapenems
- Most $\beta$-lactam antibiotics work by inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis in the bacterial organism and are the most widely used group of antibiotics.
- Bacteria often develop resistance to $\beta$ lactam antibiotics by synthesizing a $\beta$ -
53. Idetamase, an enzyme that attacks the $\beta^{\text {2 pM }}$

\section*{i). PENICILLINS in general P'kinetics}
- Adm -most of them administered parenteral e.g benzylpenicillin
- Distribution: Wide but with poor penetration into cells esp. CSF, eye. It can penetrate inflamed meninges
- Elimination: Short $\mathrm{t}_{1 / 2}(<12 \mathrm{hr})$ hence requires multiple dÃ³sing Eliminated by Renal tubular secretion.
- S/E
1) Hypersensitivity reactions - fever, itching, rashes, angioneurotic edema, anaphylactic shock.
- Have cross-sensitivity with cephalosporins
2) GIT upset such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
3) Blood disorders - neutropenia, anemia
4)Hepatitis
5) Convulsions - with very high doses.

\section*{Penicillins: Spectrum and uses}

\section*{1. Narrow spectrum; $\beta$-lactamase sensitive,}

\section*{Uses:}
- Benzylpenicillin (Pen G-Cristapen penicillin)

Streptococcal Pneumonia Meningococcal meningitis anthrax
Gas gangrene tetanus Diphtheria

Benzathine penicillin - administered I.M, has a half life of > 14 days.
- Uses: Rheumatic heart disease (dose of 1.2 MU monthly), syphilis
Phenoxymethylpenicillin administered per oral.
- Uses - Non-acute infections such as streptococcal pneumonia, streptococcal pharyngitis.
- Procaine penicillin (PPF) infrequently used.
2. Anti-staphyloccocal penicillins: Narrow spectrum, $\beta$-lactamase resistant.
- Examples: Oxacillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, Flucloxacillin (administered per oral)
- Methicillin, Nafcillin (administered parenterally).
Uses: $\beta$-lactamase producing staphylococcal infections of bone, joint.
3. Extended spectrum: $\beta$-lactamase sensitive.
Examples: ampicillin, amoxycillin)
4. Anti-pseudomonal penicillins, broad spectrum, b-lactamase sensitive, most administerd pareteral
E.g. Piperacillin, carbenicillin, tircacillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin
- NB. Penicillins inactivate aminoglycosides if given in same syringe or IV infusion (but the two act synergistically).
ii). CEPHALOSPORINS

Mechanism of action: cell wall synthesis inhibitors
- they are more resistant to $\beta$ lactamases compared to penicillins
- Adm: most are given parenterally due to poor GIT absorption.
- Distribution: Wide including - bone, joints, soft tissues, pleural, pericardial, placenta. $3^{\text {rd }}$ generation cross the meninges adequately.
- Elimination: Short half life (1-4hrs) hence require multiple dosing
Most eliminated by Renal excretion.
