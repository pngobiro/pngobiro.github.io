\section*{A. CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS}
- Antibacterial agents
- Antifungal agents
- Antiviral agents
- Antihelminthic agents
- Antiprotozoa agents
- Anticancer agents
B. SYSTEMIC PHARMACOLOGY: DRUGS ACTING ON:-
- Cardiovascular system
- Respiratory system
- Gastro-intestinal system
- Central nervous system

CHEMOTHIERAPEUIIC AGEN(IS
- Definition: Substances/chemicals that kill or inhibit the growth of infective agents or cancerous cells in the body
- Antibiotics (Antibacterial agents)substances produced by microorganisms that in very dilute concentration kill or inhibit other microorganisms -
- The goal of this agents is to be toxic (kill or sufficiently inhibit growth of) to microorganism or cancerous tissue while being harmless (minimally) to the host or non-cancerous tissue

\section*{Terminologies}
1. Bactericidal vs bacteriostatic
a) Bacteriostatic - agents that inhibit the growth (replication) of the infective agent.
- The body requires an effective immune defense.
b) Bacteriocidal - agents that kills the sensitive infective agent. The body does not requires an effective immune system.
- These agents are indicated when host immune defense is impaired, in neutropenic patients (e.g. cancer) or in life threatening situations endocarditis, meningitis.

Bacteriocidal drugs exhibit either:-
- Concentration dependent killing - rate and extent of cidal activity increases with conc. of drug e.g. aminoglycosides, quinolones
- Time-dependent killing - rate and extent of killing is maximal above the minimum bactericidal conc. and does not increase beyond this.

\section*{2. Post-antibiotic effect}
- Persistent microbial suppression even after the plasma concentration of a drug falls below the minimum inhibitory concentration. e.g. aminoglycosides, quinolones.
3. Spectrum of a chemotherapeutic agent
- Narrow - sensitivity limited to a small group of organisms
- Broad - many groups of organism sensitive to the effect of that agent (often inclusive of both gram negative and positive. A common side effect is superinfection.

\section*{Thanks to PENICILLIN He Will Come Home! Second World War}
- The first antibiotic, penicillin, was discovered in 1929 by Sir Alexander Fleming, who observed inhibition of staphylococci on an agar plate contaminated by a Penicillium mold.
- He named the active substance penicillin but was unable to isolate it.

\section*{1.Infibitors of cell wall synthesis}

\section*{a). $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-LACTAM ANTIBACTERIALS}
- Mechanism of action: inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis.
- Active only in organisms whose cell wall is formed of peptidoglycan
- Require actively dividing cells

\section*{Classes of beta lactams}
-Penicillins
- Carbapenems
-Cephalosporins
- Monobactams

\section*{Beta lactam ring}

<smiles>[Z]C(=O)NC1C(=O)N2C(C(=O)O)C([R])CS[C@H]12</smiles>
- Beta Lactam ring-a cyclic 4atom structure of several antibiotics.
- $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-lactamase - several enzymes(upto 100), that hydrolyze the beta lactam ring leading to loss of activity/resistance.
- $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-lactamase inhibitors - Clavulanic acid, sulbactam, tazobactam
- These bind to and inactivate the $\beta$-lactamase enzyme
- They are combined with some penicillins to increase the spectrum to cover $\beta$-lactamase producing organisms. E.g.
Amoxicillin+clavulanic acid = Augmentin
<smiles>[R]C(=O)NC1C(=O)N2[C@@H](C(=O)O)SC(C)(C)[C@H]12</smiles>
<smiles>[Z]C(=O)NC1C(=O)N2C(C(=O)O)C([R])CS[C@]12[Z]</smiles>
- $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-Lactam antibiotics (beta-lactam antibiotics) are a broad class of antibiotics, consisting of all antibiotic agents that contains a $\beta$-lactam nucleus in their molecular structures.
- This includes penicillin derivatives ( penams), cephalosporins (cephems), monobactams, and carbapenems
- Most $\beta$-lactam antibiotics work by inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis in the bacterial organism and are the most widely used group of antibiotics.
- Bacteria often develop resistance to $\beta$ lactam antibiotics by synthesizing a $\beta$ -
53. Idetamase, an enzyme that attacks the $\beta^{\text {2 pM }}$

\section*{i). PENICILLINS in general P'kinetics}
- Adm -most of them administered parenteral e.g benzylpenicillin
- Distribution: Wide but with poor penetration into cells esp. CSF, eye. It can penetrate inflamed meninges

- S/E
1) Hypersensitivity reactions - fever, itching, rashes, angioneurotic edema, anaphylactic shock.
- Have cross-sensitivity with cephalosporins
2) GIT upset such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.

\section*{Stages of Viral Infection}
1. Virus attaches to a cell receptor.

4. Virus uncoat, shedding its covering and releasing DNA or RNA into cell nucleus.

\section*{Viruses are intracellular parasites.}

HIV belongs to a group of viruses known as retroviruses, which carry their genetic material in the form of ribonucleic acid (RNA) rather than deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_04_5c11892027ae24547522g-05.jpg?height=1875&width=2496&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=0)
1. Attachment. In this first step, the GP120 and GP41 glycoproteins of HIV bind with the host's uninfected CD4 receptor and chemokine co-receptors which results in fusion of HIV with the CD4 T-cell membrane.
2. Uncoating. The contents of HIV's viral core (two single strands of viral RNA and three viral enzymes: reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease) are emptied into the CD4 T-cell.

DNA synthesis. HIV changes its genetic material from RNA to DNA through action of reverse transcriptase, resulting in double-stranded DNA that carries instruction for viral replication.
4. Integration. New viral DNA enters the nucleus of the CD4 T cell and through action of integrase is blended with the DNA of the CD4 T cell, resulting in permanent, lifelong infection.

NB-Prior to this step, the uninfected person has been only exposed to, not infected with, HIV. With this step, HIJV infection is permanent.

Transcription. When the CD4 T cell is activated, the double-stranded DNA forms single-stranded messenger RNA (mRNA), which builds new viruses.
6. Translation. The mRNA creates chains of new proteins and enzymes (polyproteins) that contain the components needed in the construction of new viruses.
-Polyprotein chain into the individual proteins that make up the new virus.
8. Budding. New proteins and viral RNA migrate to the membrane of the infected CD4 T cell, exit from the cell, and start the process all over.

\section*{CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY}

Cancer cells are characterized by persistent proliferation, invasive growth, and the ability to form metastases.
- Cancer can be treated with three basic modalities: surgery, radiation therapy, and drug therapy.
- Agents used for drug therapy fall into two main groups (1) cytotoxic agents and (2) noncytotoxic agents, such as hormones, immunomodulators, and targeted drugs.

Surgery and/or irradiation are the treatments of choice for most solid tumors.
- Drugs are the treatment of choice for disseminated cancers (leukemias, disseminated lymphomas, widespread metastases).
Drugs are also used as adjuvants to surgery and irradiation to kill malignant cells that surgery and irradiation leave behind.

\section*{CELL CYCLE}

The cell cycle has four major phases:
G1, in which cells prepare to synthesize DNA; $\boldsymbol{S}$, in which cells synthesize DNA;
G2, in which cells prepare for mitosis (division); and $\boldsymbol{M}$, in which cells actually divide.
Following mitosis, the resulting daughter cells may either enter G1 and repeat the cycle, or enter G0 and become mitotically dormant.
- The growth fraction of a tissue is defined as the ratio of proliferating cells to cells in G0.

The growth fraction of a tissue is defined as the ratio of proliferating cells to cells in G0.
- Tissues with a large percentage of proliferating cells and few cells in G0 have a high growth fraction.
Conversely, tissues composed mostly of G0 cells have a low growth fraction.
- Cytotoxic anticancer drugs are more toxic to cancers that have a high growth fraction than to cancers that have a low growth fraction.
Why? Because cytotoxic anticancer drugs are more active against proliferating cells than against cells in G0.

The most common cancers-solid tumors of the breast, lung, prostate, colon, and rectum -have a low growth fraction, and hence respond poorly to drugs.
In contrast, only some rarer cancers-such as acute lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, and certain testicular cancers-have a high growth fraction, and hence tend to respond well.
- To cure a patient of cancer, we must produce $100 \%$ cell kill, which is rare with chemotherapy alone.

Killing of cancer cells follows first-order kinetics.
That is, at any given dose, drugs kill a constant percentage of malignant cells, regardless of how many cells are present.
- Over the course of chemotherapy, cancer cells often become drug resistant, thereby decreasing the chance of success.
- The purpose of intermittent chemotherapy is to allow normal cells to repopulate between rounds of treatment. Unfortunately, if the cancer cells repopulate as fast as (or faster than) normal cells, there will be no reduction in tumor burden with each round of treatment, and hence treatment will fail.

Multidrug chemotherapy is generally much more effective than single-drug therapy.
Why? Because combination therapy can
(1) suppress drug resistance,
(2) increase cell kill, and
(3) reduce injury to normal cells.
- Ideally, the drugs used in combination therapy should have (1) different mechanisms of action, (2) minimally overlapping toxicities, and (3) good efficacy when used alone.
Toxicity to normal tissues is the major obstacle to successful therapy with cytotoxic anticancer drugs.

Cytotoxic anticancer drugs injure normal tissue because these drugs lack selective toxicity.
- As a rule, serious toxicity occurs to normal tissues that have a high growth fraction (ie,
bone marrow, GI epithelium, hair follicles, spermforming cells).
- Myelosuppression (toxicity to bone marrow) can reduce the number of neutrophils, platelets, and erythrocytes, thereby posing a risk of infection (from loss of neutrophils), bleeding (from loss of platelets), and anemia (from loss of erythrocytes).

Loss of neutrophils and platelets during chemotherapy is common; significant loss of erythrocytes is relatively rare, but can happen with certain drugs (eg, cisplatin).
- In patients taking myelosuppressive drugs, neutrophil counts must be monitored.

When a neutropenic patient develops an infection, immediate and vigorous intervention is required.
Until lab reports on the identity and drug sensitivity of the infecting organism are available, empiric therapy with IV antibiotics should be instituted.
- Neutropenia can be minimized by treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor, both of which act on the bone marrow to increase neutrophil production.

By injuring the epithelial lining of the Gl tract, anticancer drugs often cause stomatitis and diarrhea.
- Many anticancer drugs cause moderate to severe nausea and vomiting, in by stimulating the chemoreceptor trigger zone.
- Nausea and vomiting can be reduced by premedication with antiemetics.
- Anticancer drugs often injure hair follicles, thereby causing alopecia (hair loss).

Anticancer drugs can cause fetal malformation and death. Accordingly, women undergoing chemotherapy should be warned against becoming pregnant.
- Anticancer drugs can cause irreversible male sterility. Accordingly, men undergoing chemotherapy should be counseled about possible sperm banking.
- Chemotherapy can cause hyperuricemia as a result of DNA degradation secondary to massive cell death.

\section*{Cancer chemotherapy has three possible benefits: cure, palliation, and prolongation of useful life.}

For treatment to be justified, at least one of these benefits should be forthcoming.

The cytotoxic agents constitute the largest class of anticancer drugs.
As their name implies, these agents act directly on cancer cells to cause their death.
The cytotoxic drugs can be subdivided into eight major groups: (1) alkylating agents, (2) platinum compounds, (3) antimetabolites, (4)
hypomethylating agents, (5) antitumor antibiotics, (6) mitotic inhibitors, (7) topoisomerase inhibitors, and (8) miscellaneous cytotoxic drugs.

Cytotoxic anticancer drugs act directly on cancer cells and healthy cells to produce cell death.
Cell-cycle phase-specific drugs are effective only during a specific phase of the cell cycle (eg, S phase, M phase).
Accordingly, they are only active against cells that are participating in the cell cycle. Cells in G0 are spared.
- To be effective, phase-specific drugs must be present as neoplastic cells cycle through the phase in which the drugs act.
In practical terms, this means that phase-specific drugs must be in the blood continuously over a long

Cell-cycle phase-nonspecific drugs can affect cells during any phase of the cell cycle, including G0.
- Although phase-nonspecific drugs can inflict biochemical lesions at any time during the cell cycle, they usually are more toxic to proliferating cells than to cells in G0. Why? Because (1) G0 cells often have time to repair drug induced damage before it can result in significant harm, and (2) toxicity may not become manifest until the cells attempt to divide.

Alkylating agents injure cells primarily by forming covalent bonds with DNA.
- Bifunctional alkylating agents form cross-links in DNA, and thereby prevent DNA replication.
Bifunctional agents are more effective than monofunctional agents.
- Because alkylation reactions can take place at any time during the cell cycle, alkylating agents are considered cell-cycle phase nonspecific.
- Cyclophosphamide, the most widely used alkylating agent, is active against a broad spectrum of neoplastic diseases.

Antimetabolites are analogs of important natural metabolites, and hence are able to disrupt critical metabolic processes, especially DNA replication.
- Most antimetabolites are phase specific.
- Methotrexate, a folic acid analog, prevents conversion of folic acid to its active form.
Cell kill results primarily from disruption of DNA synthesis.
- Fluorouracil, a uracil analog, undergoes intracellular activation, after which it inhibits thymidylate synthetase, thereby depriving cells of thymidylate needed to make DNA.

Antitumor antibiotics are used to treat cancer, not infections.
- Antitumor antibiotics fall into two major groups: anthracyclines (which damage the heart) and nonanthracyclines (which don't).
- Doxorubicin is an anthracycline-type antitumor antibiotic.

Vincristine and vinblastine block assembly of the microtubules that move chromosomes during cell division. Accordingly, the drugs are M-phase specific.
- Vincristine is toxic to peripheral nerves, but does not significantly suppress bone marrow function.
Because it spares bone marrow, vincristine can be safely combined with drugs that suppress bone marrow.
- In contrast to vincristine, vinblastine causes significant bone marrow suppression but is relatively harmless to peripheral nerves.

Asparaginase converts asparagine(amino acid) into aspartic acid, and thereby deprives cells of asparagine needed to make proteins.
Cytotoxicity is limited primarily to leukemic lymphoblasts.
Why? Because these cells are unable to manufacture their own asparagine, whereas normal cells can.

Hormonal anticancer drugs act through specific hormone receptors on target tissues. As a result, their actions are fairly selective, and their toxicity to normal cells is generally low.
- Glucocorticoids are toxic to cancers of lymphoid origin, including acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemias, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

In addition to their use against lymphoid-derived cancers, glucocorticoids are used to manage complications of cancer and cancer therapy. Specific benefits include suppression of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, reduction of cerebral edema secondary to irradiation of the cranium, reduction of pain secondary to nerve compression or edema, and suppression of hypercalcemia in steroid-responsive tumors. Also, glucocorticoids can improve appetite and promote weight gain, and may impart a generalized sense of well-being.

When glucocorticoids are used acutely, their toxicities are both mild and manageable.
However, when used long term, these drugs can cause many serious toxicities, including osteoporosis, adrenal insufficiency, increased susceptibility to infection, and peptic ulcers.

Advanced prostate cancer is treated with androgen deprivation, which can be achieved with castration or drug therapy.
Early (localized) prostate cancer is treated with surgery or radiation, sometimes followed by androgen deprivation.
- Androgen deprivation can be achieved with two types of drugs: gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and androgen receptor blockers.

Leuprolide, a GnRH agonist, has a biphasic mechanism of action.
During the initial phase, the drug stimulates release of interstitial cell-stimulating hormone (ICSH) from the pituitary, and thereby increases production of testosterone by the testes.
As a result, there may be a transient "flare" in prostate cancer symptoms. With continuous use, the drug suppresses ICSH release(negative feedback mechanism), and thereby causes testosterone production to fall.

Flutamide, an androgen receptor blocker, is used in combination with a GnRH agonist to treat prostate cancer.
Benefits derive from (1) preventing cancer cells from undergoing increased stimulation during the initial phase of GnRH therapy, and (2)
blocking the effects of adrenal androgens on prostate cells.
- Breast cancer is treated with surgery, radiation, cytotoxic drugs, and hormonal agents, of which there are two major groups: antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors.

Antiestrogens fall into two major categories: (1) pure estrogen receptor antagonists and (2) SERMs, which block estrogen receptors in some tissues, and activate estrogen receptors in others.
- Tamoxifen, a SERM, is approved for prevention and treatment of breast cancer.
Benefits derive from blocking estrogen receptors on tumor cells.
- Like tamoxifen, raloxifene (a SERM) decreases the risk of breast cancer.
Compared with tamoxifen, raloxifene carries a lower risk of uterine cancer, and hence appears safer than tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention.

By activating certain estrogen receptors, tamoxifen increases the risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism.
- Fulvestrant, a pure estrogen receptor antagonist, is approved for treatment of breast cancer, but not for prevention.
- In contrast to tamoxifen and other SERMs, fulvestrant poses no risk of endometrial cancer, and only a slight risk of thromboembolism.

\section*{Cancer chemotherapy}
- It is the use of drugs to inhibit or kill proliferating cancer cells, while leaving host cells unharmed, or at least recoverable.
The cell cycle
- These are phases that all cells -both normal and neoplastic- must traverse before and during cell division.

Cell cycle.....
${ }^{\ominus}$ M: mitosis
${ }^{\bullet}$ GO: resting phase (excluded in the cell cycle).
${ }^{\bullet}$ G1: synthesis of cellular components needed for DNA synthesis
${ }^{\bullet}$ S: DNA synthesis

They include:
${ }^{\bullet}$ 1. Antimetabolites. eg

\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR DRUGS}
1.Anti-hypertensive Agents
2. Drugs Used In Heart Failure
3. Anti-angina Drugs
4. Drugs Used In Dyslipidemia

Antihypertensive drugs
Blood pressure is probably one of the most variable but best regulated functions of the body.

The purpose of the control of blood pressure is to keep blood flow constant to vital organs such as the heart, brain, and kidneys.

Without constant blood flow to these organs, death ensues within seconds, minutes, or days.

\section*{Hypertension represents an elevation in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure.}

Essential hypertension is characterized by a chronic elevation in blood pressure that occurs without evidence of other disease. Secondary hypertension Elevation of blood pressure that results from some other disorders, such as kidney disease.

The pathogenesis of essential hypertension involves :
-the kidney and its role in regulating extracellular fluid
volume through salt and water elimination.
-sympathetic nervous system hyperreactivity.
-renin-angiotensin system activity.
-in tracellular sodium and calcium levels.

\title{
Uncontrolled hypertension produces increased demands on the heart (complications).
}
-Left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure
-Atherosclerosis on the vessels of the arterial system
-Kidney disease
-Retinopathy
-Stroke.

\section*{Types of Receptors}
- Alpha adrenergic(alpha 1 and alpha 2)

Vasoconstriction, raise BP
They both respond epinephrine and norepinephrine)
Activation leads to peripheral resistance and increase in arterial BP.
-Beta-1
Heart stimulation-activation leads to increase in contractile force and increase of heart rate. Excess stimulation leads to arrythmias.
-Beta-2
Effects in smooth muscles.
Activation leads to vascular and non vascular smooth muscle relaxation.These drugs are used in treatment of asthma.

\section*{Oral administration is used for essential hypertension. Intravenous administration is reserved for acute myocardial infarction (atenolol, metoprolol).}

Cardiac dysrhythmias(esmolol, propranolol).

Severe hypertension (labetalol).

Blocking renal beta1 receptors suppress secretion of renin.
By blocking beta2 receptors produces three major effects:
(1)bronchoconstriction (through beta2 blockade in the lung),
(2) vasoconstriction (through beta2 blockade on certain blood vessels)
(3) reduced glycogenolysis (through beta2 blockade in skeletal muscle and liver).

\section*{Adverse Effects The most serious adverse effects result from blockade of beta1 receptors in the heart and blockade of beta 2 receptors in the lung.}

Bradycardia.
Beta1 blockade in the heart can cause bradycardia.
Heart rate should be assessed before each dose.
AV Heart Block.
By slowing conduction of impulses through the AV node can cause AV heart
block.
The drug is contraindicated for patients with preexisting AV block.

\section*{Heart Failure.}

In patients with cardiac disease, suppression of myocardial contractility can result in heart failure. Patients should be informed about the early signs of heart failure
(shortness of breath, night coughs, swelling of the extremities

\section*{Principal indications for the beta blockers are cardiovascular: hypertension, angina pectoris, heart failure, and supraventricular tachydysrhythmias.}

\section*{Indirect-Acting Antiadrenergic Agents Clonidine}

Clonidine [Catapres] is an antihypertensive drug that acts within the CNS.
Except for rare instances of rebound hypertension, the drug is generally free of serious adverse effects.
In addition to its use in hypertension, clonidine is used to relieve severe pain of cancer.
To provide pain relief, the drug must be administered by epidural infusion.

Mechanism of Antihypertensive Action Clonidine is an alpha2-adrenergic agonist that causes "selective" activation of alpha2 receptors in the CNS-specifically, in brainstem areas associated with autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system.
By activating central alpha2 receptors, clonidine reduces sympathetic outflow to blood vessels and the heart.

\section*{Pharmacologic Effects}

The most significant effects of clonidine occur in the heart and vascular system.
By suppressing the firing of sympathetic nerves to the heart, clonidine can cause bradycardia and a decrease in cardiac output.
By suppressing sympathetic regulation of blood vessels, the drug promotes vasodilation.
The net result of cardiac suppression and vasodilation is decreased blood pressure.

\section*{Drug Effects on Receptors}

Drugs can have two types of effects on receptors.
- Stimulating, causing a reaction
- Blocking, preventing a reaction
- Dopamine blocking
- Anticholinergics
e.g. Enalapril, captopril, lisinopril,ramipril.

\section*{ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS}

The ACE inhibitors are important drugs for treating hypertension, heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, and myocardial infarction (MI).
In addition, they are used to prevent adverse cardiovascular events in patients at risk.
Their most prominent adverse effects are cough, angioedema, first-dose hypotension, and hyperkalemia.
For all of these agents, beneficial effects result largely from suppressing formation of angiotensin II.

\section*{Mechanism of Action and Overview of Pharmacologic Effects}

ACE inhibitors produce their beneficial and adverse effects by (1)reducing levels of angiotensin II (through inhibition of ACE) and
(2) increasing levels of bradykinin (through inhibition of kinase II)- lead to cough and angioedema

By reducing levels of angiotensin II, ACE inhibitors can dilate blood vessels (primarily arterioles and to a lesser extent veins), reduce blood volume (through effects on the kidney), and, importantly, prevent or reverse pathologic changes in the heart and blood vessels mediated by angiotensin II and aldosterone.

Inhibition of ACE can also cause hyperkalemia and fetal injury.

Elevation of bradykinin causes vasodilation
(secondary to increased production of

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}
- Nearly all ACE inhibitors are administered orally.

The only exception is enalaprilat (the active form of enalapril), which is given IV.
- Except for captopril and moexipril, all oral ACE inhibitors can be administered with food.
- With the exception of captopril, all ACE inhibitors have prolonged half-lives, and hence can be administered just once or twice a day. Captopril is administered 2 or 3 times a day.
- With the exception of lisinopril, all ACE inhibitors are prodrugs that must undergo conversion to their active form in the small intestine and liver. Lisinopril

Nursing Pharmacology
-ACE inhibitors are contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.
-Bilateral renal artery stenosis
-History of hypersensitivity reactions (especially angioedema) to ACE inhibitors.
-Exercise caution in patients with salt or volume depletion, renal impairment, or collagen vascular disease, and in those taking potassium supplements, salt substitutes, potassium-sparing diuretics, aliskiren, or lithium.
b).Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) Adm: all administered per oral.

MOA: bind and block angiotensin II receptor.
S/E, C/I and effects are same as in ACE inhibitors.

Examples: Losartan, valsartan, telmisartan

\section*{ANGIOTENSIN II RECEPTOR BLOCKERS The angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are a relatively new family of drugs whose indications are evolving.}

Initially, ARBs were approved only for hypertension. Today, they also are approved for heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, myocardial infarction, and stroke prevention.

ARBs block access of angiotensin II to its receptors in blood vessels, the adrenals, and all other tissues. As a result, ARBs have effects much like those of the ACE inhibitors.
-By blocking angiotensin II receptors on blood vessels, ARBs cause dilation of arterioles and veins.
-By blocking angiotensin II receptors in the heart, ARBs can prevent angiotensin II from inducing pathologic changes in cardiac structure.
-By blocking angiotensin II receptors in the adrenals, ARBs decrease release of aldosterone, and can thereby increase renal excretion of sodium and water.
-Sodium and water excretion is further increased through dilation of renal blood vessels.

\section*{NB}

In contrast to the ACE inhibitors, ARBs do not inhibit kinase II, and hence do not increase levels of bradykinin in the lung. As a result, ARBs do not promote cough, the most common reason for stopping ACE inhibitors

The therapeutic uses for ARBs(7 drugs)
-heart failure - valsartan
-myocardial infarction(post)- valsartan
-prevention of stroke - losartan
-diabetic neuropathy - losartan and ibersartan
-and hypertension -All

Contraindication
Like the ACE inhibitors, ARBs can injure the developing fetus if taken during the second or third trimester of pregnancy, and hence are contraindicated during this period.

\section*{Direct Renin Inhibitor}

Direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) are drugs that act on renin to inhibit the conversion of angiotensinogen into angiotensin I.
By decreasing production of angiotensin I, DRIs can suppress the entire RAAS. Currently, only one DRI is available.
Aliskiren [Tekturna], approved for hypertension in 2007, was the first DRI on the market. Blood pressure reduction equals that seen with ACE inhibitors. Aliskiren causes less cough and angioedema than the ACE inhibitors, but poses similar risks to the developing fetus.

Aldosterone Antagonists
Aldosterone antagonists are drugs that block receptors for aldosterone.
Two such agents are available: eplerenone and spironolactone.
Both drugs have similar structures and actions, and both are used for the same disorders: hypertension and heart failure.
They differ, however, in that spironolactone is less selective than eplerenone.
As a result, spironolactone causes more side effects.

\section*{Eplerenone}

Eplerenone, approved in September 2002, is the first representative of a new class of agents: selective aldosterone receptor blockers.

The drug is used for hypertension and heart failure, and has one significant side effect: hyperkalemia.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Eplerenone produces selective blockade of aldosterone receptors, having little or no effect on receptors for other steroid hormones (eg, glucocorticoids, progesterone, androgens).
In the kidney, activation of aldosterone receptors promotes excretion of potassium and retention of sodium and water.
Receptor blockade has the opposite effect: retention of potassium and increased excretion of sodium and water.

\section*{Spironolactone}

Spironolactone [Aldactone], a much older drug than eplerenone, blocks receptors for aldosterone, but also binds with receptors for other steroid hormones (eg, glucocorticoids, progesterone, androgens).
Blockade of aldosterone receptors underlies beneficial effects in hypertension and heart failure.

\section*{Calcium Channel Blockers}

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are drugs that prevent calcium ions from entering cells.
These agents have their greatest effects on the heart and blood vessels.
CCBs are used widely to treat hypertension, angina pectoris, and cardiac dysrhythmias.
Alternative names for CCBs are calcium antagonists and slow channel blockers.

Calcium channels are gated pores in the cytoplasmic membrane that regulate entry of calcium ions into cells.

Calcium entry plays a critical role in the function of vascular smooth muscle (VSM) and the heart.

\section*{Vascular Smooth Muscle}

In VSM, calcium channels regulate contraction. When an action potential travels down the surface of a smooth muscle cell, calcium channels open and calcium ions flow inward, thereby initiating the contractile process.
If calcium channels are blocked, contraction will be prevented and vasodilation will result. At therapeutic doses, CCBs act selectively on peripheral arterioles and arteries and arterioles of the heart. CCBs have no significant effect on veins.

\section*{Heart}

In the heart, calcium channels help regulate function of the myocardium, the sinoatrial (SA) node, and the atrioventricular (AV) node.
Calcium channels at all three sites are coupled to beta1- adrenergic receptors.

Myocardium.
In cardiac muscle, calcium entry has a positive inotropic effect. That is, calcium increases force of contraction. If calcium channels in atrial and ventricular muscle are blocked, contractile force will diminish.
SA Node.
Pacemaker activity of the SA node is regulated by calcium influx. When calcium channels are open, spontaneous discharge of the SA node increases. Conversely, when calcium channels close, pacemaker activity declines. Hence, the effect of calcium channel blockade is to reduce heart rate.

AV Node.
Impulses that originate in the SA node must pass through the AV node on their way to the ventricles.
Because of this arrangement, regulation of AV conduction plays a critical role in coordinating contraction of the ventricles with contraction of the atria.
The excitability of AV nodal cells is regulated by calcium entry. When calcium channels are open, calcium entry increases and cells of the AV node discharge more readily. Conversely, when calcium channels are closed, discharge of AV nodal cells is suppressed.
Hence, the effect of calcium channel blockade is to decrease velocity of conduction through the AV node.

\section*{Coupling of Cardiac Calcium Channels to Beta1Adrenergic Receptors.}

In the heart, calcium channels are coupled to beta1adrenergic receptors .
As a result, when cardiac beta1 receptors are activated, calcium influx is enhanced.
Conversely, when beta1 receptors are blocked, calcium influx is suppressed.
Because of this relationship, CCBs and beta blockers have identical effects on the heart.
That is, they both reduce force of contraction, slow heart rate, and suppress conduction through the AV node.
c) Calcium channel blockers
E.g. amlodipine, nifedipine, felodipine, verapamil, diltiazem. Adm: per oral.
Mxn: inhibit influx of calcium into arterial smooth muscle cells hence reducing contraction. Effect: reduce peripheral vascular resistance.
S/E: hypotension, palpitation, perspiration, dizziness, headache, GIT disturbance.
C/I: cardiogenic shock, hypotension, pregnancy (except nifedipine)

\section*{d)Sympatholytic agents}

Mxn: generally they reduce sympathetic effects on arteries and the heart.
Effects: reduce peripheral vascular resistance, reduced cardiac contractility, heart rate \& cardiac output.
1. Centrally acting e.g. Methyldopa

S/E: sedation, depression, nightmares, hemolytic anaemia, vertigo.
2. Beta-blockers e.g. propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, atenolol
S/E: bradycardia, bronchospasm, heart failure,
(29) hypoglycemia, GIT disturbance.

\section*{Vasodilators}

Vasodilation can be produced with a variety of drugs. Some of these drugs act primarily on arterioles, some act primarily on veins, and some act on both types of vessel.

The vasodilators are widely used, with indications ranging from hypertension to angina pectoris to heart failure.
Four agents-hydralazine, minoxidil, diazoxide, and nitroprusside.

Venodilators: they reduce (the degree of
- stretch of the ventricular muscle prior to contraction). E.g. isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerine
- Arterial dilators: they reduce afterload(the force the heart works against to pump blood).
E.g. hydralazine, and Minoxidil
* Both arterial and venodilators
E. g. ACE Inhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers, sodium nitroprusside.
NB: are used in combination with other drugs.

\section*{Therapeutic Uses}

The vasodilators, as a group, have a broad spectrum of uses. Principal indications are essential hypertension, hypertensive crisis, angina pectoris, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Additional indications include pheochromocytoma, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and production of controlled hypotension during surgery.
The specific applications of any particular agent are determined by its pharmacologic profile. Important facets of that profile are route of administration, site of vasodilation (arterioles, veins, or both), and 30 Nursing Pharmacology

\section*{INTRODUCTION TO DIURETICS How Diuretics Work}

Most diuretics share the same basic mechanism of action: blockade of sodium and chloride reabsorption.
By blocking the reabsorption of these prominent solutes, diuretics create osmotic
pressure within the nephron that prevents the passive reabsorption of water.
Hence, diuretics cause water and solutes to be retained within the nephron, and thereby promote the excretion of both.

The increase in urine flow that a diuretic produces is directly related to the amount of sodium and chloride reabsorption that it blocks.

Diuretics can cause hypovolemia (from excessive fluid loss), acid-base imbalance, and disturbance of electrolyte levels.

\section*{Classification of Diuretics}

There are four major categories of diuretic drugs:
(1) high-ceiling (loop) diuretics (eg, furosemide);
(2) thiazide diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide);
(3) osmotic diuretics (eg, mannitol); and
(4) potassium-sparing diuretics.

\section*{HIGH-CEILING (LOOP) DIURETICS The high-ceiling agents are the most effective diuretics available. \\ These drugs produce more loss of fluid and electrolytes than any other diuretics. \\ Because their site of action is in the loop of Henle, the high-ceiling agents are also known as loop diuretics.}

\section*{Furosemide}

Furosemide [Lasix] is the most frequently prescribed loop diuretic and will serve as our prototype for the group.

\section*{Mechanism of Action}

Furosemide acts in the thick segment of the ascending limb of Henle's loop to block reabsorption of sodium and chloride.
By blocking solute reabsorption, furosemide prevents passive reabsorption of water.
Since a substantial amount (20\%) of filtered NaCl is normally reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, interference with reabsorption here can produce profound

Pharmacokinetics
Furosemide can be administered orally, IV, and IM. With oral administration, diuresis begins in 60 minutes and persists for 8 hours.
Oral therapy is used when rapid onset is not required. Effects of intravenous furosemide begin within 5 minutes and last for 2 hours.
Intravenous therapy is used in critical situations (eg, pulmonary edema) that demand immediate mobilization fluid.
Furosemide undergoes hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion.

Furosemide drug should be avoided when less efficacious diuretics (thiazides) will suffice.
Conditions that justify use of furosemide include
(1)pulmonary edema associated with congestive heart failure (CHF);
(2) edema of hepatic, cardiac, or renal origin that has been unresponsive to less efficacious diuretics; and
(3)hypertension that cannot be controlled with other diuretics. Furosemide is especially useful in patients with severe renal impairment.

Adverse Effects
Hyponatremia, Hypochloremia, and Dehydration.
Furosemide can produce excessive loss of sodium, chloride, and water.
Severe dehydration can result.
Signs of evolving dehydration include dry mouth, unusual thirst, and oliguria (scanty urine output).
Impending dehydration can also be anticipated from excessive loss of weight.
If dehydration occurs, furosemide should be withheld.

> Dehydration can promote thrombosis and embolism. Symptoms include headache and pain in the chest, calves, or pelvis.
> The risk of dehydration and its sequelae can be minimized by initiating therapy with low doses, adjusting the dosage carefully, monitoring weight loss every day, and administering furosemide on an intermittent schedule.

Hypotension.
Furosemide can cause a substantial drop in blood pressure.
At least two mechanisms are involved:
(1)loss of volume and
(2) relaxation of venous smooth muscle, which reduces venous return to the heart.
Signs of hypotension include dizziness, light headedness, and fainting.
If blood pressure falls precipitously, furosemide should be discontinued.
Because of the risk of hypotension, blood pressure şould be monitored routinely.

Outpatients should be taught to monitor their blood pressure and instructed to notify the prescriber if it drops substantially.
Patients should be informed about symptoms of postural hypotension (dizziness, light-headedness) and advised to sit or lie down if these occur.
Patients should be taught that postural hypotension can be minimized by getting up slowly.

\section*{Hypokalemia.}

Potassium is lost through increased secretion in the distal nephron.
If serum potassium falls below $3.5 \mathbf{~ m E q} / \mathbf{L}$, fatal dysrhythmias may result.
Hypokalemia can be minimized by consuming potassium-rich foods (eg, dried fruits, nuts, spinach, citrus fruits, potatoes, bananas), taking potassium supplements, or using a potassium-sparing diuretic.

\section*{Ototoxicity.}

Rarely, loop diuretics cause hearing impairment. With furosemide, deafness is transient. With ethacrynic acid (another loop diuretic), irreversible hearing loss has occurred.
The ability to impair hearing is unique to the highceiling agents; diuretics in other classes are not ototoxic.
Because of the risk of hearing loss, caution is needed when high-ceiling diuretics are used in combination with other ototoxic drugs (eg, aminoglycoside antibiotics).

Hyperglycemia.
Elevation of plasma glucose is a potential, albeit uncommon, complication of furosemide therapy.

Hyperglycemia appears to result from inhibition of insulin release.
Increased glycogenolysis and decreased glycogen synthesis may also contribute.

When furosemide is taken by a diabetic patient, he or she should be especially diligent about monitoring blood glucose content.

\section*{Hyperuricemia.}

Elevation of plasma uric acid is a frequent side effect of treatment.
For most patients, furosemide-induced hyperuricemia is asymptomatic.
However, for patients predisposed to gout, elevation of uric acid may precipitate a gouty attack.
Patients should be informed about symptoms of gout (tenderness or swelling in joints) and instructed to notify the prescriber if these develop.

\section*{Use in Pregnancy.}

When administered to pregnant laboratory animals, high-ceiling diuretics have caused maternal death, abortion, fetal resorption, and other adverse effects. There are no definitive studies on loop diuretics during human pregnancy.
However, given the toxicity displayed in animals, prudence dictates that pregnant women use these drugs only if absolutely required.

\section*{Potassium-Sparing Diuretics.}

The potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene) can help counterbalance the potassium-wasting effects of furosemide, thereby reducing the risk of hypokalemia. Lithium.
Lithium is used to treat bipolar disorder .
In patients with low sodium, excretion of lithium is reduced.
Hence, by lowering sodium levels, furosemide can cause lithium to accumulate to toxic levels. Accordingly, lithium levels should be monitored, and, if they climb too high, lithium dosage should be

\section*{THIAZIDES AND RELATED DIURETICS}

The thiazide diuretics (also known as benzothiadiazides) have effects similar to those of the loop diuretics.
Like the loop diuretics, thiazides increase renal excretion of sodium, chloride, potassium, and water.
In addition, thiazides elevate plasma levels of uric acid and glucose (risk of hyperglycemia).

The principal difference between the thiazides and high-ceiling agents is that the maximum diuresis produced by the thiazides is considerably lower than the maximum diuresis produced by the high-ceiling drugs.
In addition, whereas loop diuretics can be effective even when urine flow is scant, thiazides cannot.

Hydrochlorothiazide(HCTZ)
Hydrochlorothiazide is the most widely used thiazide diuretic.
Used in hypertension.

\section*{Hydrochlorothiazide promotes urine production by blocking the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the early segment of the distal convoluted tubule.}

Retention of sodium and chloride in the nephron causes water to be retained as well, thereby producing an increased flow of urine.

Since only $10 \%$ of filtered sodium and chloride is normally reabsorbed at the site where thiazides act, the maximum urine flow these drugs can produce is lower than with the high-ceiling drugs.

The ability of thiazides to promote diuresis is dependent on adequate kidney function.

These drugs are ineffective when GFR is low (less than 15 to $20 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ ).

Hence, in contrast to the high-ceiling agents, thiazides cannot be used to promote fluid loss in patients with

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Diuresis begins about 2 hours after oral administration.

Effects peak within 4 to 6 hours, and may persist up to 12 hours. Most of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine.

\section*{Therapeutic Uses}

\section*{Essential Hypertension.}

The primary indication for hydrochlorothiazide is hypertension, a condition for which thiazides are often drugs of first choice.

For many hypertensive patients, blood pressure can be controlled with a thiazide alone, although many other patients require multiple-drug therapy.

\section*{Edema.}

Thiazides are preferred drugs for mobilizing edema associated with mild to moderate heart failure.
They are also given to mobilize edema associated with hepatic or renal disease.

\section*{Diabetes Insipidus.}

Diabetes insipidus is a rare condition characterized by excessive production of urine.
In patients with this disorder, thiazides reduce urine production by $30 \%$ to $50 \%$. The mechanism of this paradoxical effect is unclear.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

The adverse effects of thiazide diuretics are similar to those of the high-ceiling agents.
In fact, with the exception that thiazides lack ototoxic actions, the adverse effects of the thiazides and loop diuretics are nearly identical.
Hyponatremia, Hypochloremia, and Dehydration. Loss of sodium, chloride, and water can lead to hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and dehydration.

It should be noted, however, that since the diuresis produced by thiazides is moderate, these drugs have a smaller impact on sodium, chloride, and water than do the loop diuretics.

To evaluate fluid and electrolyte status, electrolyte levels should be determined periodically, and the patient should be weighed on a regular basis.

\section*{Hypokalemia.}

Like the high-ceiling diuretics, the thiazides can cause hypokalemia from excessive potassium excretion. Potassium levels should be measured periodically, and, if serum potassium falls below 3.5 mEq/L, treatment with potassium supplements or a potassium-sparing diuretic should be instituted. Hypokalemia can be minimized by eating potassiumrich foods.

Use in Pregnancy and Lactation.
The thiazides have direct and indirect effects on the developing fetus. By reducing blood volume, thiazides can decrease placental perfusion, and may thereby compromise fetal nutrition and growth.
Furthermore, thiazides can cross the placental barrier. Potential effects include electrolyte imbalance, hypoglycemia, jaundice, and hemolytic anemia. Thiazides should not be used routinely during pregnancy.
Edema of pregnancy is not an indication for diuretic therapy, except when severe.

Hyperglycemia.
Like the loop diuretics, the thiazides can elevate plasma levels of glucose.
Significant hyperglycemia develops only in diabetic patients, who should be especially diligent about monitoring blood glucose.
To maintain normal glucose levels, the diabetic patient may require larger doses of insulin or an oral hypoglycemic drug.

\section*{POTASSIUM-SPARING DIURETICS}

The potassium-sparing diuretics can elicit two potentially useful responses.
First, they produce a modest increase in urine production.
Second, they produce a substantial decrease in potassium excretion.
Because their diuretic effects are limited, the potassium-sparing drugs are rarely employed alone to promote diuresis.
However, because of their marked ability to decrease potassium excretion, these drugs are often used to counteract potassium loss caused by thiazide and

\end{tabular}

\section*{Spironolactone MOA-}

Spironolactone [Aldactone] blocks the actions of aldosterone in the distal nephron.
Since aldosterone acts to promote sodium uptake in exchange for potassium secretion
The diuresis caused by spironolactone is scanty because most of the filtered sodium load has already been reabsorbed by the time the filtrate reaches the distal nephron.

The effects of spironolactone are delayed, taking up to 48 hours to develop. Why the delay?
Recall that aldosterone acts by stimulating cells of the distal nephron to synthesize the proteins required for sodium and potassium transport.
By preventing aldosterone's action, spironolactone blocks the synthesis of new proteins, but does not stop existing transport proteins from doing their job. Hence, effects are not visible until the existing proteins complete their normal life cycle-a process that takes 1 or 2 days.

\section*{Therapeutic Uses}

\section*{Hypertension and Edema.}

Spironolactone is used primarily for hypertension and edema.
Although it can be employed alone, the drug is used most commonly in combination with a thiazide or loop diuretic.
The purpose of spironolactone in these combinations is to counteract the potassium-wasting effects of the more powerful diuretics.
Spironolactone also makes a small contribution to diuresis.

\section*{Heart Failure.}

In patients with severe heart failure, spironolactone greatly reduces mortality and hospital admissions.
Benefits derive from protective effects of aldosterone blockade in the heart and blood vessels .
Other Uses.
In addition to the applications discussed above, spironolactone can by used for primary
hyperaldosteronism , premenstrual syndrome , polycystic ovary
syndrome , and acne in young women .

\section*{Adverse Effects Hyperkalemia.}

The potassium-sparing effects of spironolactone can result in hyperkalemia, a condition that can produce fatal dysrhythmias.
Although hyperkalemia is most likely when spironolactone is used alone, it can also develop when spironolactone is used in conjunction with potassium wasting agents (thiazides and high-ceiling diuretics).

If serum potassium rises above $5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, or if signs of hyperkalemia develop (eg, abnormal cardiac rhythm), spironolactone should be discontinued and potassium intake restricted. Injection of insulin can help lower potassium levels by promoting potassium uptake into cells.

\section*{Benign and Malignant Tumors.}

When given long term to rats in doses 25 to 250 times those used in humans, spironolactone caused benign adenomas of the thyroid and testes, malignant mammary tumors, and proliferative changes in the liver.
The risk of tumors in humans from use of normal doses is unknown.

\section*{Endocrine Effects.}

Spironolactone is a steroid derivative with a structure similar to that of steroid hormones (eg, progesterone, estradiol, testosterone).

As a result, spironolactone can cause a variety of endocrine effects, including gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities, impotence, hirsutism, and deepening of the voice.

Drug Interactions
Thiazide and Loop Diuretics.
Spironolactone is frequently combined with thiazide and loop diuretics.
The goal is to counteract the potassium-wasting effects of the more powerful diuretic.

\title{
Because of the risk of hyperkalemia, spironolactone must never be combined with potassium supplements, salt substitutes (which contain potassium chloride), or another potassium sparing diuretic.
}

In addition, three groups of drugs-angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and direct renin inhibitors-can elevate potassium

\section*{Amiloride}

Amiloride has actions similar to those of triamterene. Drug inhibits potassium loss by direct blockade of sodium-potassium exchange in the distal nephron. Produces only modest diuresis. Although it can be employed alone as a diuretic, amiloride is used primarily to counteract potassium loss caused by more powerful diuretics (thiazides, highceiling agents).

The major adverse effect is hyperkalemia. Accordingly, concurrent use of other potassium-sparing diuretics or potassium supplements must be avoided.
Caution is needed if the drug is combined with an ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or direct renin inhibitor.
Amiloride is available in a fixed-dose combination with hydrochlorothiazide under the trade name Moduretic.

\section*{Osmotic Diuretics}

Four compounds-mannitol, urea, glycerin, and isosorbide—are classified as osmotic diuretics.
However, of the four, only mannitol is used for its diuretic actions.
The osmotic agents differ from other diuretics in both mechanism and indications.

\section*{Mannitol}

Mannitol is a simple six-carbon sugar that possesses the four properties characteristic of an osmotic diuretic:

It is freely filtered at the glomerulus.
- It undergoes minimal reabsorption.
- It is not metabolized to a significant degree.
- It is pharmacologically inert (ie, it has no direct effects on the biochemistry or physiology of cells).

\section*{Mechanism of Diuretic Action}

Mannitol promotes diuresis by creating an osmotic force within the lumen of the nephron.
Unlike other solutes, mannitol undergoes minimal reabsorption after filtration.
As a result, most of the drug remains within the nephron, creating an osmotic force that inhibits passive reabsorption of water.

The degree of diuresis produced is directly related to the concentration of mannitol in the filtrate; the more mannitol present, the greater the diuresis.

Mannitol has no significant effect on the excretion of potassium and other electrolytes.

\section*{Pharmacokinetics}

Mannitol does not diffuse across the GI epithelium and cannot be transported by the uptake systems that absorb dietary sugars.
Accordingly, in order to reach the circulation, the drug must be given parenterally.
Following IV injection, mannitol distributes freely to extracellular water.
Diuresis begins in 30 to 60 minutes and persists 6 to 8 hours. Most of the drug is excreted intact in the urine.

\section*{Therapeutic Uses}

\section*{1.Prophylaxis of Renal Failure}

Under certain conditions (eg, dehydration, severe hypotension, hypovolemic shock), blood flow to the kidney is decreased, causing a great reduction in filtrate volume.
2. Reduction of Intracranial Pressure.

Intracranial pressure (ICP) that has been elevated by cerebral edema can be reduced with mannitol.

The drug lowers ICP because its presence in the cerebral vasculature creates an osmotic force that draws edematous fluid out of the brain.

There is no risk of increasing cerebral edema because mannitol cannot exit the capillary beds of the brain.
3. Reduction of Intraocular Pressure.

Mannitol and other osmotic agents can lower IOP. Mannitol reduces IOP by rendering the plasma hyperosmotic with respect to intraocular fluids, thereby creating an osmotic force that draws ocular fluid into the blood.
Use of mannitol to lower IOP is reserved for patients who have not responded to more conventional treatment.

\section*{Adverse Effects}

\section*{Edema.}

Mannitol can leave the vascular system at all capillary beds except those of the brain.
When the drug exits capillaries, it draws water along, causing edema.
Mannitol must be used with extreme caution in patients with heart disease, since it may precipitate CHF and pulmonary edema.
If signs of pulmonary congestion or CHF develop, use of the drug must cease immediately.

Other Adverse Effects.
Common responses include headache, nausea, and vomiting.
Fluid and electrolyte imbalance may also occur.

\section*{Key Points}
- More than $99 \%$ of the water, electrolytes, and nutrients that are filtered at the glomerulus undergo reabsorption.
- Most diuretics block active reabsorption of sodium and chloride, and thereby prevent passive reabsorption of water.
- The amount of diuresis produced is directly related to the amount of sodium and chloride reabsorption blocked.

Drugs that act early in the nephron are in a position to block the greatest amount of solute reabsorption, and hence produce the greatest diuresis.
- High-ceiling diuretics (loop diuretics) block sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle.

High-ceiling diuretics produce the greatest diuresis.
- In contrast to thiazide diuretics, high-ceiling diuretics are effective even when the glomerular filtration rate is low.
- High-ceiling diuretics can cause dehydration through excessive fluid loss.
- High-ceiling diuretics can cause hypotension by decreasing blood volume and relaxing venous smooth muscle.

General anaesthesia Concepts
- An Ideal Anaesthetic should cause unconsciousness, analgesia, amnesia, muscle relaxation and loss of reflexes.
- Anesthesia protocols involve use of:
- Premedication.
- Induction of anaesthesia: intravenous anesthetics.
- Maintainance of anaesthesia: inhaled anaesthetics and,
- Skeletal muscle relaxants.

Warning! Always check

\section*{Premedication}
- Objectives are to: relief anxiety, reduce amount of secretions, reduce volume \& increase pH of gastric contents prior to surgery
Benzodiazepines: used to reduce anxiety.
- E.g. temazepam, midazolam, diazepam, lorazepam.
*Antimuscarinic agents: to reduce secretions.
- E.g. Atropine. Adm I.M or P.O.
$\% \mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{2}}$-receptor antagonists: to reduce gastric acidity. E.g. ranitidine.
NB: premedication is not commonly used nowadays.

\section*{Intravenous Anaesthetics}
- These agents are used to induce anaesthesia.
* Thiopental (barbiturate) has a rapid onset but short duration due to redistribution from the brain to other tissues. Causes hypotension, tissue damage on extravasation.
Midazolam is a benzodiapine with amnestic effects.
Fentanyl and related opioids have less Cardovascular actions than inhaled anesthetics. Recovery can be facilitated by naloxone.

\section*{Intravenous Anaesthetics}

Propofol: rapid onset. There is complete and rapid recovery from its effects. Also has antiemetic actions. Used for short procedures.
Causes pain on injection, hypotension.
* Ketamine causes "dissociative anesthesia." can be administered booth I.M \& I.V. produces minimal respiratory depression. Causes an increase in blood pressure.

\section*{Maintenance of anaesthesia}
- Agents used to maintain anaesthesia, administered by inhalation.
* Nitrous oxide: Incomplete anesthetic; rapid onset and recovery. Has analgesic effects.
Desflurane: Low volatility; poor induction agent; rapid recovery
Sevoflurane: Rapid onset and recovery; unstable in soda-lime
* Enflurane: Medium rate of onset and recovery
* Isoflurane: Medium rate of onset and recovery
* Halothane: Medium rate of onset and recovery.

Causes cardiac arrhythmias.

\section*{Muscle relaxants}
- Mainly used to: facilitate tracheal intubation, permit artificial ventilation \& relax muscles to make surgery possible.

- Sedation
- Urinary retention
- Hallucinations \& nightmares.
B). NSAIDS

Mxn: inhibit enzyme Cyclo-oxygenase 1 (COX1) \& Cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2), hence inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.
- Cyclooxygenase (COX), is an enzyme that is responsible for formation of important biological mediators called prostanoids, including prostaglandins, prostacyclin and thromboxane.
- Pharmacological inhibition of COX can provide relief from the symptoms of inflammation and pain.
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, exert their effects through inhibition of COX.
tramadol (Ultram)
- High success rate when given with NSAIDs (ibuprofen)
- Has slow onset of action
- Is not a controlled substance, but has shown potential for addiction

\section*{NSAIDS}

Therapeutic effect: analgesia, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory.
Classification:
- Non-selective COX inhibitors
- Selective COX-2 inhibitors.

\section*{Non-selective COX inhibitors.}
E.g. diclofenac, fenoprofen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, piroxicam, meloxicam.
Uses: rheumatoid arthritis, gout, pain relief.
S/E: indigestion, gastric bleeding \& perforation, salt \& water retention, bronchospasm.
D/I: antagonise the actions of diuretics\& antihypertensive drugs
- Increase the effects of anticoagulants.

\section*{Selective COX-2 inhibitors}
E.g. celecoxib, rofecoxib.
- Selectively inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins that mediate inflammation hence they produce less of gastric ulceration.
Precaution on using NSAIDS:
- In liver disease, heart failure, renal disease or patients taking diuretics ( may precipitate kidney damage).

Other analgesics
- Salicylates
- (Acetaminophen) Paracetamol

\section*{Salicylates}
E.g. Asprin (acetylsalicylic acid)

Adm: per oral.
Elimination: metabolised in liver \& excreted in urine. Excretion is facilitated in alkaline urine.
Uses: pain relief, reduces platelet aggregation; used for an anti-inflammatory effect ; antipyretic in acute rheumatic fever.
S/E: gastric irritation, gastric bleeding
- At higher doses: dizziness, tinnitus, deafness, hyperventilation.
- risk for developing Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious syndrome of rapid liver degeneration and encephalopathy.
C/I: history of PUD, bleeding disorders, liver disease.
Treatment of asprin poisoning: gastric lavage, forced

Paracetamol (acetaminophen)
- The mechanism of analgesic action of acetaminophen is unclear. The drug is only a weak COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor in peripheral tissues, which accounts for its lack of anti-inflammatory effect.
Adm: per oral (tablet or syrup).
- Used to provide mild analgesia in children < 12 years.
S/E: uncommon at normal dosage
- In overdose-severe hepatotoxicity. Prompt administration of acetylcysteine, is lifesaving after an overdose. Alcoholics
(44) havèng anninchleased risk of paracetamol:08 pm

\section*{Laxatives}
- Laxatives are foods, compounds, and/or drugs that facilitate or increase bowel movements.
- They are most often used to treat constipation
- Laxatives contain chemicals that help increase stool motility, bulk, and frequency -- thus relieving temporary constipation

\section*{Types of Laxatives}
- Include pills, capsules, and liquids; suppositories; and enemas.

\section*{Bulking Agents (Fiber)}
- Fiber is the laxative most clinicians recommend for normal and slowtransit constipation.
- Fiber is naturally available in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
- Fiber is also available over the counter in Metamucil, Fiber-Lax, Benefiber

\section*{Lubricant Laxatives}
- Lubricant laxatives make stools slippery.
- The mineral oil within these products adds a slick layer to the intestine's walls and stops the stool from drying out.
- Lubricant laxatives are best used as a short-term cure for constipation.

\section*{Stimulant Laxatives}
- This type of laxative works by stimulating the lining of the intestine, thereby accelerating the stool's journey through the colon.
- Stimulant laxatives also increase a stool's hydration.

\section*{Antidiarrheal Medications}
- An antidiarrheal is a drug that is used to slow down or stop loose stools (diarrhea).
Types of antidiarrheal medications:
- Imodium (loperamide)- decreases the speed and number of intestinal contractions, thereby curbing diarrhea.
- Side effects of loperamide can include abdominal pain, dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.
© Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate)- slows diarrhea because it restricts the amount of water entering the bowels.
- Side effects of Pepto-Bismol include constipation, black stools, or a black tongue.
- Overdoses of Pepto-Bismol can be dangerous, so only take the prescribed amount and don't double up doses.

RESPIRATORY SYSTEM DRUGS
1. Bronchodilators
2. Corticosteroids (steroids)

\section*{1. BRONCHODILATORS}
-Also called relievers
-Mainly used in Asthma \& Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
a). Sympathomimetic agents.

- Other drugs such as epinephrine \& ephedrine have largely been replaced by beta -2 agonists.
Effects
- Relax airway smooth muscle causing
(46) onchodilation.

\section*{Beta- $_{2}$ agonists}
- All are derivatives of epinephrine.
*Short-acting: Albuterol, salbutamol, terbutaline, metaproterenol, and pirbuterol. Act within 30 mins .

\section*{Long-acting: Salmeterol and}

Formoterol. They are highly lipid soluble with a duration of action $>12 \mathrm{hrs}$.

Adm: inhalation (metered dose inhaler), Nebulization therapy, per oral (tablets).
- Albuterol and terbutaline tablets are
(46) varilable while terbutaline can also be ${ }^{\text {pm }}$

\section*{b). Methylxanthine drugs}
E.g. Theophylline (tea), Theobromine (cocoa), Caffeine(coffee). Administered per oral.
Effects:
- Causes smooth muscle relaxation.
- Inhibits histamine release and bronchoconstriction. USES:
- Reserved for non-responders to $\beta$-2 agonists and steroids.
- Theophylline is the most effective bronchodilator of them. It has a narrow (46) erapeutic window( $5-20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{l}$ ) hence ${ }^{11: 08 \mathrm{pm}}$

Systemic effects of methylxanthines
- CNS: insomnia, nervousness, seizures (especially caffeine)
- CVS: arrythmias.
- GIT: anorexia, increased acid secretion
- RENAL SYSTEM: diuresis
- RESP: smooth muscle relaxation.

ADM: intravenously (IV).
Atropine is the prototype. Derivatives include ipratropium bromide \& tiotropium.
NB: Generally they are less effective bronchodilator than $\beta 2$-agonists but the
(46) vougan be combined.

\section*{2. CORTCOSTEROIDS}
-Also called long term controllers of asthma..
Mxn: Inhibition of the lymphocytic, eosinophilic airway mucosal inflammation.
-Unlike $\beta$-agonists and theophylline, chronic use of inhaled steroids reduces bronchial reactivity.
Examples: Beclomethasone, triamcinolone, flunisolide,fluticasone, and budesonide, are lipid soluble. These are
(46) dministered by inhalation.

\section*{Corticosteroids.....}

Use: Long-term control of asthma, usually in combination with beta-2 agonists.

\section*{Side effects:}

Short-term: oropharyngeal candidiasis, hoarsness of voice.

\section*{ANTI-HISTAMINES}

\section*{Introduction}
- Histamine exerts its effects through histamine receptors $\left(\mathrm{H}_{1}, \mathrm{H}_{2}, \mathrm{H}_{3} \& \mathrm{H}_{4}\right)$.
- General effects of histamine include:
- CNS: stimulant.
- CVS: hypotension, vasodilatation, tachycardia.
- RESP: bronchoconstriction
- GIT: gastric acid secretion, increase peristalsis.
- Anti-histamines block these receptors to produce their effects. Commonly used anti-histamines are $\mathrm{H}_{1} \& \mathrm{H}_{2}$.
a) Histamine-1 $\left(\mathrm{H}_{1}\right)$ antagonists
- E.g. diphenhydramine, cyclizine, meclizine, chlorpheniramine, promethazine, cetrizine.
Efects:
- Sedation, antiemetic, anti-allergy.

Uses:
- Allergic reactions-urticaria, allergic rhinitis.
- Motion sickness (promethazine, diphenhydramine)
- Nausea \& vomiting in pregnancy (morning sickness)
b) Histamine-2 ( $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ ) antagonists
- E.g. ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine.

Effect:
- Inhibits gastric acid secretion.

Uses:
- Peptic ulcer disease
- Gastro-Esophageal reflux disease (GERD).

General S/E of anti-histamines
${ }^{-}$Drowsiness, sedation, constipation.

\section*{RESUSCITATION DRUGS}
- During cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in advanced life support, drugs comes later after the use of oxygen \& ECG monitoring.
${ }^{-}$The main drugs used include: epinephrine, amiodarone, lidocaine, adenosene \& atropine.
* Epinephrine is widely used in CPR to:-
- Elevate BP, increase myocardial contractility \& heart rate, increase cerebral perfusion. Amiodarone: used to treat arryhthmias e.g. ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation.

\section*{*lidocaine}
- Used in managenment of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.
*Adenosine: used in supraventricular tachycardia. Has a short duration of action (< 2minutes).
Sodium hydrogen carbonate: used to correct metabolic acidosis
*Atropine: increases the heart rate by blocking the vagus nerve.
- Used in asystole when CPR \& other drugs have failed.

\section*{Routes of administration of resuscitation drugs.}
- All resuscitation drugs can be administered intravenously, endotracheal tube, intraosseous \& intracardiac route based on the situation.
