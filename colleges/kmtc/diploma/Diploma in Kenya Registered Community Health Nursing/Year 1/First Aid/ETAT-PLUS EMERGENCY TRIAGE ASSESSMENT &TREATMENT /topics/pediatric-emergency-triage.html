                        <p>Many deaths in hospital occur within 24 hours of admission. Some of these deaths can be
                            prevented if very sick children are quickly identified on their arrival and treatment is
                            started without delay. In many hospitals around the world, children are not checked before a
                            senior health worker examines them; as a result, some seriously ill patients have to wait a
                            very long time before they are seen and treated.</p>
                        <p>Children are known to have died of a treatable condition when waiting in the queue for their
                            turn.</p>
                        <p>The idea of triage is to prevent this from happening. The word "triage" means sorting. The
                            use of triage to prioritize the critically ill dates back to the early 19th century, when
                            this was developed by military surgeons in the Napoleonic war between France and Russia.</p>
                        <p>Triage is the process of rapidly examining sick children when they first arrive in order to
                            place them in one of the following categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Those with EMERGENCY SIGNS who require immediate emergency treatment.</li>
                            <li>Those with PRIORITY SIGNS who should be given priority in the queue so they can be
                                rapidly assessed and treated without delay.</li>
                            <li>Those who have no emergency or priority signs and are NON-URGENT cases. These children
                                can wait their turn in the queue for assessment and treatment. The majority of sick
                                children will be non-urgent and will not require emergency treatment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Ideally, all children should be checked on their arrival by a person who is trained to assess
                            how ill they are. This person decides whether the child will be seen immediately and receive
                            life-saving treatment, or will be seen soon, or can safely wait for his or her turn to be
                            examined.</p>

                        <p>Triage of patients involves looking for signs of serious illness or injury. These emergency
                            signs relate to the; Airway-Breathing-Circulation/Consciousness-Dehydration and are easily
                            remembered as "ABCD".</p>
                        <p>Each letter refers to an emergency sign which, when positive, should alert you to a patient
                            who is seriously ill and needs immediate assessment and treatment.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Step 1. Check whether there is any airway or breathing problem; start immediate
                                treatment to restore breathing. Manage the airway and give oxygen.</li>
                            <li>Step 2. Quickly check whether the child is in shock or has diarrhoea with severe
                                dehydration. Give oxygen start IV fluid resuscitation. In trauma, if there is external
                                bleeding, compress the wound to stop further blood loss.</li>
                            <li>Step 3. Quickly determine whether the child is unconscious or convulsing. Give IV
                                glucose for hypoglycaemia and / or an anti-convulsant for convulsing.</li>

                        <p>Triaging should not take much time. For a child who does not have emergency signs, it takes
                            on average 20 seconds.</p>
                        <p>The health worker should learn to assess several signs at the same time. A child who is
                            smiling or crying does not have severe respiratory distress, shock or coma. The health
                            worker looks at the child, observes the chest for breathing and priority signs such as
                            severe malnutrition and listens to abnormal sounds such as stridor or grunting.</p>
                        <p>Several methods are available to facilitate the triaging process. One example is a stamp
                            being used in Malawi consisting of the "ABCD" signs in which the health worker circles the
                            correct step and initiates emergency treatment "E" or puts them in priority groups "P" or
                            "Q" for children who can wait in the queue.</p>
                        <p>Colours can also be used for differentiating the three groups, giving a red sticker to
                            emergency cases, a yellow for priority and green for the queue.</p>

                        <p>Triage should be carried out as soon as a sick child arrives in the hospital, well before any
                            administrative procedure such as registration. This may require reorganizing the flow of
                            patients in some locations.</p>
                        <p>Triage can be carried out in different locations - e.g. in the outpatient queue, in the
                            emergency room, or in a ward if the child has been brought directly to the ward at night.
                        </p>
                        <p>In some settings, triage is done in all these places. Emergency treatment can be given
                            wherever there is room for a bed or trolley for the sick child and enough space for the
                            staff to work on the patient, and where appropriate drugs and supplies are easily
                            accessible.</p>
                        <p>If a child with emergency signs is identified in the outpatient queue, he/she must quickly be
                            taken to a place where treatment can be provided immediately, e.g. the emergency room or
                            ward.</p>

                        <p>A child who is in shock must be given intravenous (IV) fluids rapidly. A bolus (large volume)
                            of fluid is pushed in rapidly in a child with shock who does not have severe malnutrition.

                            <li>Insert an intravenous (IV) catheter and begin giving fluids rapidly for shock. Normal
                                (0.9%) saline or Ringer's lactate solution can be used for rapid fluid replacement. Give
                                20 mL/kg of fluid and reassess the signs of shock. 20 mL/kg boluses can be give two more

                        <p>Diarrhoea is one of the commonest causes of death among under-five children. Death most
                            commonly is due to dehydration. Children with signs of severe dehydration (such as sunken

                            movements), or does not respond at all, the level is at "P" or "U". We then refer to that

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4. Severe Pallor</h3>
                        <p>Pallor is unusual paleness of the skin, and severe pallor is a sign of severe anaemia which
                            might need urgent transfusion.</p>
                        <p>It can be detected by comparing the child's palms with your own. If the palms are very pale
                            (almost paperwhite), the child is severely anaemic.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5. Poisoning</h3>
                        <p>A child with a history of swallowing drugs or other dangerous substances needs to be assessed
                            immediately, as he can deteriorate rapidly and might need specific treatments depending on
                            the substance taken. The mother will tell you if she has brought the child because of
                            possible intoxication</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">6. Severe Pain</h3>
                        <p>If a child has severe pain and is in agony, she/he should be prioritized to receive early
                            full assessment and pain relief. Severe pain may be due to severe conditions such as acute
                            abdomen, meningitis, etc.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7. Lethargy or Irritable and Restless</h3>
                        <p>Recall from your assessment of coma with the AVPU scale whether the child was lethargic. A
                            lethargic child responds to voice but is drowsy and uninterested (V in the AVPU scale).</p>
                        <p>The continuously irritable or restless child is conscious but cries constantly and will not
                            settle.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">8. Respiratory distress</h3>
                        <p>When you assessed the airway and breathing, did you observe any respiratory distress? If the
                            child has severe respiratory distress, it is an emergency. There may be signs present that
                            you do not think are severe, e.g. lower chest wall indrawing (not severe), or difficulty in
                            breathing. In this case, the child does not require emergency treatment but will need urgent
                            assessment. Decisions on the severity of respiratory distress come with practice. If you
                            have any doubts, have the child seen and treated immediately.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">9. Urgent Referral</h3>
                        <p>The child may have been sent from another clinic. Ask the mother if she was referred from
                            another facility and for any note that may have been given to her.</p>
                        <p>Read the note carefully and determine if the child has an urgent problem.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">10. Severe wasting (Severe Malnutrition)</h3>
                        <p>A child with visible severe wasting has a form of malnutrition called marasmus. To assess for
                            this sign, look rapidly at the arms and legs as well as the child's chest.</p>
                        <p><strong>Oedema of both feet</strong></p>
                        <p>Oedema of both feet is an important diagnostic feature of kwashiorkor, another form of severe
                            malnutrition. Other signs are changes in the skin and hair.</p>

                        <p>Burns are extremely painful and children who seem quite well can deteriorate rapidly. If the
                            burn occurred recently, it is still worthwhile to cool the burnt area with water, for
                            example, by sitting the child in a bathtub with cool water. Any child with a major burn,
                            trauma or other surgical condition needs to be seen quickly. Get surgical help or follow
                            surgical guidelines.</p>
                        <p>Triage all sick children. When a child with emergency signs is identified, take to the
                            emergency room or treatment area and start the appropriate emergency treatments immediately.
                            Do not proceed to the next step before treatment is begun for a positive sign.</p>
