\section*{History of Trauma System Development}
- Standardized Trauma Assessment
- Nebraska Cornfield, 1976
- Orthopedic Surgeon
- Lead to development of ATLS
- Trauma Systems Development
- First developed my military in wartime
- i.e. MASH Units
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_86155866482698229e1bg-04.jpg?height=547&width=661&top_left_y=350&top_left_x=1785)
- Expanded to Level 1,2,3 Trauma Centers

- Statewide networks of systems/Refferal systems
- Level 1 - Highest level of care, Leaders in research, clinical care and education
- Level 2 - Provides definitive care in wide range of complex traumatic patients
- Level 3 - Provides initial stabilization and treatment. May care for uncomplicated trauma patients
- Level 4 - Provides initial stabilization and transfers all trauma patients for definitive care
- WHERE ARE WE IN KENYA?????

\section*{Mechanisms of Injury}
- Blunt Trauma
- Compression Forces
- Cells in tissues are compressed and crushed
- E.g. Spleen
- Shear Forces
- Acceleration/Deceleration Injury
- E.g. Aorta
- Shearing force = Spectrum from Full thickness tear (Exsanguination) to Partial tear (Pseudoaneurysm)
- Overpressure
- Body cavity compressed at a rate faster than the tissue around it, resulting in rupture of the closed space
- E.g. Plastic bag
- E.g. in trauma = diaphragmatic rupture, bladder injury

\section*{Mechanisms of Injury}
- Frontal Impact Collisions
- Lateral Impact Collisions (T bone)
- Rear Impact Collisions
- Rollover Mechanism
- Open Vehicle or Motorcycle/Moped
- Pedestrian Vs. Car
- Penetrating Injury (Guns vs. Knives)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_86155866482698229e1bg-06.jpg?height=1767&width=2430&top_left_y=35&top_left_x=51)

\section*{Basics of Trauma Assessment}
- Preparation
- Team Assembly
- Equipment Check
- Triage
- Sort patients by level of acuity (SATS)
- Primary Survey
- Designed to identify injuries that are immediately life threatening and to treat them as they are identified
- Resuscitation
- Rapid procedures and treatment to treat injuries found in primary survey before completing the secondary survey
- Secondary Survey
- Full History and Physical Exam to evaluate for other traumatic injuries
- Monitoring and Evaluation, Secondary adjuncts
- Transfer to Definitive Care
- ICU, Ward, Operating Theatre, Another facility

\section*{Primary Survey}
irway and Protection of Spinal Cord
reathing and Ventilation
irculation
isability
xposure and Control of the Environment

\section*{Primary Survey}
- Key Principles
- When you find a problem during the primary survey, FDCIT.
- If the patient gets worse, restart from the beginning of the primary survey
- Some critical patients in the Emergency Department may not progress beyond the primary survey

\section*{irway and Protection of Spinal Cord}
- Why first in the algorithm?
- Loss of airway can result in death in < 3 minutes
- Prolonged hypoxia = Inadequate perfusion, End-organ damage
- Airway Assessment
- Vital Signs = RR, O2 sat
- Mental Status = Agitation, Somnolent, Coma
- Airway Patency = Secretions, Stridor, Obstruction
- Traumatic Injury above the clavicles
- Ventilation Status = Accessory muscle use, Retractions, Wheezing
- Clinical Pearls
- Patients who are speaking normally generally do not have a need for immediate airway management
- Hoarse or weak voice may indicate a subtle tracheal or laryngeal injury
- Noisy Respirations frequently indicates an obstructed respiratory pattern

\section*{irway Interventions}
- Maintenance of Airway Patency
- Suction of Secretions
- Chin Lift/Jaw thrust
- Nasopharyngeal Airway
- Definitive Airway
- Airway Support
- Oxygen
- NRBM (100\%)
- Bag Valve Mask
- Definitive Airway
- Definitive Airway
- Endotracheal Intubation
- In-line cervical stabilization
- Surgical Crichothyroidotomy
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_86155866482698229e1bg-12.jpg?height=1749&width=747&top_left_y=31&top_left_x=1594)

\section*{Protection of Spinal Cord}
- General Principle: Protect the entire spinal cord until injury has been excluded by radiography or clinical physical exam in patients with potential spinal cord injury.
- Spinal Protection
- Rigid Cervical Spinal Collar = Cervical Spine
- Long rigid spinal board or immobilization on flat surface such as stretcher = T/L Spine
- Etiology of Spinal Cord Injury
- Road Traffic Accidents (47\%)
- High energy falls (23\%)
- Clinical Pearls
- Treatment (Immobilization) before diagnosis
- Return head to neutral position
- Do not apply traction
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_86155866482698229e1bg-13.jpg?height=636&width=645&top_left_y=771&top_left_x=1744)
- Diagnosis of spinal cord injury should not precede resuscitation
- Motor vehicle crashes and falls are most commonly associated with spinal cord injuries
- Main focus = Prevention of further injury

\section*{Cervical spine Immobilization}
- Return head to neutral position
- Maintain in-line stabilization
- Correct size collar application
- Blocks/tape
- Sandbags

\section*{reathing and Ventilation}
- General Principle: Adequate gas exchange is required to maximize patient oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination
- Breathing/Ventilation Assessment:
- Exposure of chest
- General Inspection
- Tracheal Deviation
- Accessory Muscle Use
- Retractions
- Absence of spontaneous breathing
- Paradoxical chest wall movement
- Auscultation to assess for gas exchange
- Equal Bilaterally
- Diminished or Absent breath sounds
- Palpation
- Deviated Trachea
- Broken ribs
- Injuries to chest wall

\section*{reathing and Ventilation}

\section*{Identify Life Threatening Injuries}
- Tension Pneumothorax
- Air trapping in the pleural space between the lung and chest wall
- Sufficient pressure builds up and pressure to compress the lungs and shift the mediastinum
- Physical exam
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_86155866482698229e1bg-16.jpg?height=668&width=642&top_left_y=943&top_left_x=54)

- Physical Exam
- Absent or diminished breath sounds
- Dullness to percussion over chest
- Hemodynamic instability
- Treatment = Large Caliber Tube Thoracostomy
- 10-20\% of cases will require Thoracotomy for control of bleeding

\section*{reathing and Ventilation}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_86155866482698229e1bg-18.jpg?height=626&width=633&top_left_y=360&top_left_x=79)

- Flail Chest
- Direct injury to the chest resulting in an unstable segment of the chest wall that moves separately from remainder of thoracic cage
- Typically results from two or more fractures on 2 or more ribs
- Typically Accompanied by a pulmonary contusion
- Physical Exam = Paradoxical movement of chest segment
- Treatment = Improve Abnormalities in gas exchange
- Early Intubation for patients with respiratory distress
- Avoidance of overaggressive fluid resuscitation

Open Pneumothorax
- Sucking Chest Wound
- Large defect of chest wall
- Leads to rapid equilibration of atmospheric and intrathoracic pressure
- Impairs oxygenation and ventilation
- Initial Treatment
- Three Sided occlusive dressing
- Provides a flutter valve effect
- Chest tube placement remote to site of wound
- Avoid complete dressing, will create a tension pneumothorax

\section*{Needle Thoracostomy}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_86155866482698229e1bg-20.jpg?height=728&width=964&top_left_y=551&top_left_x=92)

\section*{Trauma in Special Populations}

Pregnancy
- Supine Hypotensive Syndrome
- After 20 weeks, enlarged uterus with fetus and amniotic fluid compresses inferior vena cava
- Decreases venous return and decrease cardiac output
- Keep pregnant patients in left lateral decubitus position to avoid excessive hypotension
- Optimal maternal and fetal outcome is determined by adequate resuscitation of mother
- Fetal Monitoring

\section*{Trauma in Special Populations}
- Pediatric Trauma Resuscitation
- Differences in head to body ratio and relative size and location of anatomic features make children more susceptible to head injury, abdominal injury
- Underdeveloped anatomy leads to chest pliability and less protection of thoracic cage
