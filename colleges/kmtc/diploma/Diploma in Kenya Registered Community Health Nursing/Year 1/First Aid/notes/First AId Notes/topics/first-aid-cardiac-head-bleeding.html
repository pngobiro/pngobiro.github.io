                                <p>A nose bleed is when blood flows from one or both nostrils. It's normally caused by the tiny blood vessels inside the nostrils being ruptured.</p>
                                <p>Common causes of nose bleeds include a blow to the nose, sneezing, picking or blowing the nose, and high blood pressure.</p>

                                <p>Most nose bleeds are minor and only last a few minutes, but they can be dangerous if someone loses a lot of blood.</p>
                                <p>If someone has had a blow to the head, the blood may appear thin and watery. This could mean that their skull is fractured and fluid is leaking from around the brain. If that happens, it is very serious and you should call 999 or 112 for emergency medical help. See advice for head injuries.</p>

For severe bleeding: Apply direct, firm pressure to the wound using a clean cloth or dressing. If an object is embedded, apply pressure around it, not directly on it. Elevate the injured part above the heart if possible. Call emergency services immediately. Treat for shock.</p>

                                <p>Shock (not to be confused with emotional shock) is a life-threatening condition which happens when the body isn't getting enough flow of blood.</p>

                                <p>Shock can be caused by anything that reduces the flow of blood, including:</p>
