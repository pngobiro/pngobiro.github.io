                        <p>First aid is the assistance given to any person suffering a sudden illness or injury,<sup>[1]</sup> with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, and/or promote recovery. It includes initial intervention in a serious condition prior to professional medical help being available, such as performing CPR while awaiting an ambulance, as well as the complete treatment of minor conditions, such as applying a plaster to a cut. First aid is generally performed by the layperson, with many people trained in providing basic levels of first aid, and others willing to do so from acquired knowledge. Mental health first aid is an extension of the concept of first aid to cover mental health.</p>
                        <p>There are many situations which may require first aid, and many countries have legislation, regulation, or guidance which specifies a minimum level of first aid provision in certain circumstances. This can include specific training or equipment to be available in the workplace (such as an Automated External Defibrillator), the provision of specialist first aid cover at public gatherings, or mandatory first aid training within schools. First aid, however, does not necessarily require any particular equipment or prior knowledge, and can involve improvisation with materials available at the time, often by untrained persons.<sup>[2]</sup></p>

                            <div class="content-card">
                                <p>Certain skills are considered essential to the provision of first aid and are taught ubiquitously. Particularly the "ABC"s of first aid, which focus on critical life-saving intervention, must be rendered before treatment of less serious injuries. ABC stands for Airway, Breathing, and Circulation. The same mnemonic is used by all emergency health professionals. Attention must first be brought to the airway to ensure it is clear. Obstruction (choking) is a life-threatening emergency. Following evaluation of the airway, a first aid attendant would determine adequacy of breathing and provide rescue breathing if necessary. Assessment of circulation is now not usually carried out for patients who are not breathing, with first aiders now trained to go straight to chest compressions (and thus providing artificial circulation) but pulse checks may be done on less serious patients.</p>
                                <p>Some organizations add a fourth step of "D" for Deadly bleeding or Defibrillation, while others consider this as part of the Circulation step. Variations on techniques to evaluate and maintain the ABCs depend on the skill level of the first aider. Once the ABCs are secured, first aiders can begin additional treatments, as required. Some organizations teach the same order of priority using the "3Bs": Breathing, Bleeding, and Bones (or "4Bs": Breathing, Bleeding, Burns, and Bones). While the ABCs and 3 Bs are taught to be performed sequentially, certain conditions may require the consideration of two steps simultaneously. This includes the provision of both artificial respiration and chest compressions to someone who is not breathing and has no pulse, and the consideration of cervical spine injuries when ensuring an open airway.</p>

                                <p>In order to stay alive, all persons need to have an open airway-a clear passage where air can move in through the mouth or nose through the pharynx and down into the lungs, without obstruction. Conscious people will maintain their own airway automatically, but those who are unconscious (with a GCS of less than 8) may be unable to maintain a patent airway, as the part of the brain which automatically controls breathing in normal situations may not be functioning.</p>
                                <p>If the patient was breathing, a first aider would normally then place them in the recovery position, with the patient leant over on their side, which also has the effect of clearing the tongue from the pharynx. It also avoids a common cause of death in unconscious patients, which is choking on regurgitated stomach contents.</p>
                                <p>The airway can also become blocked through a foreign object becoming lodged in the pharynx or larynx, commonly called choking. The first aider will be taught to deal with this through a combination of 'back slaps' and 'abdominal thrusts'.</p>
                                <p>Once the airway has been opened, the first aider would assess to see if the patient is breathing. If there is no breathing, or the patient is not breathing normally, such as agonal breathing, the first aider would undertake what is probably the most recognized first aid procedure-cardiopulmonary resuscitation or CPR, which involves breathing for the patient, and manually massaging the heart to promote blood flow around the body.</p>

                                        <p>You may have to loosen, open, cut away or remove clothing. Ask their permission to do this and make sure you're sensitive and discreet.</p>
                                        <p>Make a note of any minor injuries as you go. Only return to these when you have finished checking the whole body, to make sure you don't miss any more serious injuries.</p>

                                    <div class="content-card">
                                        <p><strong>Breathing and pulse:</strong> How fast and strong is their breathing and pulse?</p>
                                        <p><strong>Bleeding:</strong> Check the body from head-to-toe for any bleeding.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Head and neck:</strong> Is there any bleeding, swelling, sensitivity or a dent in the bone, which could mean a fracture?</p>
                                        <p><strong>Ear:</strong> Do they respond when you talk to them? Is there any blood or clear fluid coming from either ear? If so, this could mean a serious head injury.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Eyes:</strong> Are they open? What size are their pupils (the black bit)? If they're different sizes this could mean a head injury.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Nose:</strong> Is there any blood or clear fluid coming from the nostrils? This could mean a serious head injury.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Mouth:</strong> Check their mouth for anything which could block their airway. Look for mouth injuries or burns in their mouth and anything unusual in the line of their teeth.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Skin:</strong> Note the colour and temperature of their skin. Pale, cold, clammy skin suggests shock. A flushed, hot face suggests fever or heatstroke. A blue tinge suggests lack of oxygen from an obstructed airway, poor circulation, or asthma.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Neck:</strong> Loosen any clothing around their neck to look for signs like a medical warning medallion or a hole in their windpipe. Run your fingers down their spine without moving it to check for any swelling, sensitivity or deformity.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Chest:</strong> Check if the chest rises easily and evenly on each side as they breathe. Feel the ribcage to check for any deformity or sensitivity. Note if breathing is difficult for them or painful in any way.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Collar bone, arms and fingers:</strong> Feel all the way along the collar bones to the fingers for any swelling, sensitivity or deformity. Check they can move their elbows, wrists and fingers.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Arms and fingers:</strong> Check they don't have any unusual feeling in their arms or fingers. If their fingertips are pale or greyish-blue this could suggest their blood isn't circulating properly. Also look for any needle marks on the forearms, which suggest drug use. See if they have a medical warning bracelet.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Spine:</strong> If they've lost any movement or sensation in their legs or arms. Don't move them to check their spine as they may have a spinal injury. Otherwise, gently put your hand under their back and check for any swelling or soreness</p>
                                        <p><strong>Abdomen:</strong> Gently feel their abdomen to check for any signs of internal bleeding, like stiffness or soreness, on each side.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Hips and pelvis:</strong> Feel both hips and the pelvis for signs of a fracture. Check their clothing for any signs of incontinence, which may suggest a spinal injury or bladder injury, or bleeding from body openings, which may suggest a pelvic fracture.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Legs:</strong> Check the legs for any bleeding, swelling, deformity or soreness. Ask them to raise one leg and then the other, and to move their ankles and knees.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Toes:</strong> Check their movement and feeling in their toes. Compare both feet and note the colour of the skin: greyish-blue skin could suggest a problem with their circulation or an injury due to cold, like hypothermia.</p>
