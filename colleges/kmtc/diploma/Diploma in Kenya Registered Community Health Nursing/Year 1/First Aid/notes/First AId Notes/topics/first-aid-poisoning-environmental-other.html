                                <p>Alcohol poisoning is what happens to someone when they've drunk a dangerous amount of alcohol, normally in a short space of time.</p>
                                <p>Drinking too much alcohol stops the nervous system from working properly, particularly in the brain. This can severely weaken the mental and physical body functions, like sight, speech, coordination and memory.</p>
                                <p>Alcohol poisoning can also send a person into deep unresponsiveness and, at worst, can slow or even shut down their breathing, causing death.</p>

                                <p>The effects of food poisoning can make someone feel extremely ill. The most important thing is for you to keep encouraging the person to drink water so they don't get dehydrated. Most people will get better without needing treatment.</p>

                                <p>If volumes of smoke or gas are inhaled or breathed in, it can be deadly. If a casualty has inhaled fumes they need immediate medical attention as they are likely to have low levels of oxygen in their blood and tissues.</p>
                                <p>Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas. When inhaled, the gas directly prevents the red blood cells from carrying oxygen to the body's tissues and organs. It can quickly prove fatal if it is inhaled in large amounts, for example from vehicle exhaust fumes or smoke within a confined space, or even in small amounts, for example due to leakage of fumes from a faulty boiler or heater.</p>
                                <p>Carbon monoxide is difficult to detect as it has no taste or smell. Unfortunately, lots of people who have carbon monoxide poisoning may not be aware that they are affected and may wrongly blame their symptoms on other reasons. The young and the old are at increased risk. It is best to reduce the risk of poisoning by making sure that gas appliances are serviced regularly and by fitting an approved carbon monoxide detector in your home.</p>

                                <p>Frostbite happens when parts of the skin and other tissues freeze due to low temperatures. Frostbite usually affects the fingers and toes as they are the parts of the body furthest from the heart.</p>
                                <p>If someone has severe frostbite then they might permanently lose all feeling in that part of their body. Frostbite can also lead to gangrene, when the blood vessels and soft tissues become permanently damaged leading to death of the tissue.</p>
                                <p>Frostbite usually happens in freezing or cold and windy weather. People who cannot move around are more likely to get it. Someone with frostbite will probably have hypothermia, so be prepared to treat them for that too.</p>

                                <p>Meningitis is an infection of the membranes that surround the brain and the spinal cord. Meningitis can be caused by bacteria or a virus. Anyone can get meningitis, whatever age they are, but babies and young children under five are most at risk.</p>
                                <p>Meningitis can be very serious. If you suspect meningitis you must call 999 or 112 immediately, so they can get to hospital to be treated as soon as possible.</p>
                                <p>If spotted early, and treated quickly, most people make a full recovery.</p>

                                <p>If someone has meningitis, they won't usually show all the symptoms and signs at the same time. But these are the key things to look for:</p>

                                <p>Hypothermia happens when someone's body temperature drops below <span class="math-inline">$35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(95^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$</span>.

                                <p>Hypothermia can become life-threatening quickly, so it's important to treat someone with hypothermia straight away. Severe hypothermia, when the body temperature falls below <span class="math-inline">$30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(86^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$</span>, is often fatal.</p>
                                <p>Hypothermia is usually caused by being in a cold environment for a long time. This could be from staying outdoors in cold conditions, falling into cold water, or from living in a poorly heated house. Elderly people, babies, homeless people and anyone who is thin and frail or not able to move around easily are particularly vulnerable.</p>
