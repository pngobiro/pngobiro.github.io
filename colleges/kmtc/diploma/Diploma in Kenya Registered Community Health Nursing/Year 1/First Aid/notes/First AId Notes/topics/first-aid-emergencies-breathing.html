                                <p>Electrically charged - an alternating current (AC) causes muscular spasms which can lock their grasp so that they can't let go. This means they are electrically charged so you mustn't touch them or you'll risk electrocution too. Instead you need to break their contact with the source of electricity.</p>

                                <p>In an asthma attack, the muscles of the air passages in the lungs go into spasm. This makes the airways narrower, making it difficult to breathe.</p>
                                <p>Sometimes something specific can trigger an attack, such as an allergy, a cold, or cigarette smoke. At other times, someone may have a sudden attack with no obvious trigger.</p>
                                <p>People with asthma usually deal with their own attacks by using a blue reliever inhaler at the first sign of an attack. But if someone doesn't have an inhaler, or the attack is severe, you may need to help.</p>

                                <p>Choking is when your airway gets blocked and you can't breathe properly. When someone chokes, the airway can either be partly or fully blocked. If it's a mild blockage, they should be able to clear it themselves by coughing. If it's a severe blockage, they won't be able to cough so without anyone's help they'll become unresponsive.</p>
                                <p>But if they do become unresponsive, their throat muscles could relax and open the airway enough for you to give rescue breaths - be prepared to give rescue breaths and chest compressions.</p>

                                <p>Croup is a childhood condition that makes it difficult to breathe. Croup is caused by the inflammation of the windpipe (trachea) and the voice box (larynx).</p>
                                <p>Children with croup have difficulty breathing, a distinctive barking cough and may have a croaky voice.</p>
                                <p>Croup can usually be diagnosed by a GP and treated at home. If an attack of croup is severe and doesn't go away, call 999 or 112 for emergency help.</p>
                                <p>There is a small risk that they may have a rare but similar condition called epiglottitis. The epiglottis is a small flap of tissue at the base of the tongue which keeps food from going down the windpipe when swallowing. If this gets infected and swollen it can block the airway.</p>
                                <p>If you think a child might have epiglottitis, it's a medical emergency and you need to call 999 or 112 immediately.</p>

                                <p>When someone's drowning, it may not look like the violent, splashing call for help that most people expect from watching TV. When someone's actually drowning, they won't able to make any noise, so can easily go unnoticed, even if friends or family are nearby.</p>

                                <p>Hyperventilation is excessive breathing, normally caused by extreme anxiety, and can happen at the same time as a panic attack.</p>
                                <p>When someone is hyperventilating they breathe unnaturally fast or deep. This makes the blood lose more carbon dioxide than usual, which can make them feel weak and dizzy. As they begin to breathe normally again, they should feel better.</p>
                                <p>It is very rare for children to suffer from hyperventilation, so if you think a child is hyperventilating you should try looking for other reasons why they could be showing these symptoms.</p>
