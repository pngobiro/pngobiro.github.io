                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Meningitis is an infection of the membranes that surround the brain and the spinal cord. Meningitis can be caused by bacteria or a virus. Anyone can get meningitis, whatever age they are, but babies and young children under five are most at risk. Meningitis can be very serious. If you suspect meningitis you must call 999 or 112 immediately, so they can get to hospital to be treated as soon as possible. If spotted early, and treated quickly, most people make a full recovery.</p>

                   <h3>What to look for - Meningitis</h3>
                   <p>If someone has meningitis, they won't usually show all the symptoms and signs at the same time. But these are the key things to look for:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>flu-like illness with a temperature</li>
                       <li>cold hands and feet</li>
                        <li>joint and limb pain</li>
                        <li>blotchy or very pale skin</li>
                   </ul>
                    <p>As the meningitis infection develops:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>severe headache</li>
                        <li>neck stiffness</li>
                       <li>vomiting</li>
                       <li>eyes become sensitive to light</li>
                       <li>drowsiness</li>
                        <li>in babies - high-pitched moaning or a whimpering cry, floppiness, and a tense, bulging soft spot on their head (fontanelle).</li>
                   </ul>
                    <p>Later you may see a distinctive rash of red or purple spots that doesn't fade when pressed.</p>
                 </div>
                 <div class="content-block">
                     <h3>What you need to do - Meningitis</h3>
                     <ul>
                        <li>If someone has any of the signs of meningitis, like shielding their eyes from the light, call 999 or 112 for emergency medical help straight away and treat the fever.</li>
                       <li>Check to see if they have a rash, with most rashes if you press the spots with the side of a glass, the spots will fade ‚Äì if they don't fade, call 999 or 112 for medical help at once.</li>
                        <li>While you're waiting for help to arrive, reassure them and keep them cool.</li>
                        <li>Keep checking their breathing, pulse and level of response.</li>
                     </ul>

            <section class="content-section">
                 <h2>üìö Hypothermia</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Hypothermia happens when someone's body temperature drops below 35¬∞C (95¬∞F). Normal body temperature is around 37¬∞C (98. 6¬∞F). Hypothermia can become life-threatening quickly, so it's important to treat someone with hypothermia straight away. Severe hypothermia, when the body temperature falls below 30¬∞C (86¬∞F), is often fatal. Hypothermia is usually caused by being in a cold environment for a long time. This could be from staying outdoors in cold conditions, falling into cold water, or from living in a poorly heated house. Elderly people, babies, homeless people and anyone who is thin and frail or not able to move around easily are particularly vulnerable.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>What to look for - Hypothermia</h3>
                     <p>These are the four key things to look for:</p>
                    <ol>
                       <li>Shivering, cold, pale, and dry skin</li>
                        <li>Tiredness, confusion, and irrational behaviour</li>
                        <li>Slow and shallow breathing</li>
                        <li>Slow and weakening pulse</li>
                    </ol>
                 </div>
                 <div class="content-block">
                   <h3>What you need to do - Hypothermia</h3>
                   <p>If you notice any of these symptoms, you need to warm them up.</p>
                     <p>If they are outside, if possible get them indoors. Cover them with layers of blankets and warm the room to about 25¬∞C (77¬∞F). Give them something warm to drink, like soup, and high energy food, like chocolate.</p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Once they have warmed up, tell them to see a doctor as soon as possible</li>
                         <li>If they lose responsiveness at any point, open their airway, check their breathing and prepare to treat someone who's become unresponsive.</li>
                     </ul>
                    <p>If they are outdoors and you can't move them indoors:</p>
                    <ol>
                         <li>Find something for them to lie on to protect them from the cold ground, like heather or pine branches.</li>
                         <li>If their clothes are wet, change them into dry clothes, if possible. Put them in a sleeping bag and cover them with blankets, if available. Make sure their head is covered too.</li>
                       <li>Then call 999/112 for an ambulance. If possible, don't leave them by themselves but stay with them until help arrives.</li>
                        <li>While you wait for help to arrive, keep checking their breathing, pulse and level of response.</li>

                    <h3>What you need to do - Broken bones and fractures</h3>
                    <ul>
                       <li>If it is an open fracture, cover the wound with a sterile dressing and secure it with a bandage. Apply pressure around the wound to control any bleeding.</li>
                       <li>Support the injured body part to stop it from moving. This should ease any pain and prevent any further damage.</li>
                         <li>Once you've done this, call 999 or 112 for medical help. While waiting for help to arrive, don't move them unless they're in immediate danger.</li>
                         </ul>
                     <p><b>Waiting for medical help to arrive</b></p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Protect the injured area by using bandages to secure it to an uninjured part of the body to stop it from moving. For example, fractures on the arm can be secured with a sling, and a leg with a fracture can be tied to the uninjured leg.</li>
                         <li>Keep checking the casualty for signs of shock. This does not mean emotional shock, but is a life-threatening condition, often caused by losing blood.</li>
                         <li>If they lose responsiveness at any point, open their airway, check their breathing and prepare to treat someone who's become unresponsive.</li>

                 <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>Dislocated joints</h3>
                    <p>A joint is where two bones join or connect. A dislocated joint happens when bones are partly or completely pulled out of their normal position. Joints can dislocate when a strong force wrenches the bone into an unnatural position, or because the muscle violently contracts. The most common joints that dislocate are the shoulder, knee, jaw, or joints in the thumbs or fingers. Dislocating a joint can be really painful and cause other damage, like a break in the end of the surrounding bone or tearing of the ligaments around the joint. Sometimes it's difficult to tell whether the injury is a dislocation or a fractured bone. If you're not sure, then always treat it as broken bone. Don't try to put the dislocated bone back into its socket as you could make it worse.</p>

                         <li>Stop the joint from moving using a bandage. For an arm injury, make a sling to support the arm. For a leg injury, use padding or broad-fold bandages.</li>
                       <li>To give extra support for an injured arm, tie it in place by bandaging around the sling and the chest.</li>
                         <li>Once you've stopped the joint from moving, take or send the injured person to hospital.</li>
                       <li>Keep checking their breathing, pulse and level of response. Check the circulation beyond the bandages every ten minutes and loosen if necessary.</li>

                    <h3>Spinal injury</h3>
                     <p>The spinal cord connects the brain to the rest of the body. Together they make up the central nervous system. The spine is made up of: the spinal cord itself, the bones that protect the spinal cord (called vertebrae), the discs of tissue between the vertebrae, the surrounding muscles and the nerves which branch off it, to carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body in the form of high-speed electric pulses. The spinal cord connects to individual muscles and tells them to move (called motor function). It also connects to organs like the skin, which communicates feelings like touch, pain and heat (called sensory functions). The greatest risk if someone has a spinal injury is that their spinal cord will be either temporarily or permanently damaged. If this happens, they'll become paralysed from the point of injury down. The most common cause of a spinal injury is extreme force, violent twisting or bending forwards or backwards. You should be aware of the possibility of a spinal injury if someone has: fallen from a height, e.g. a ladder, fallen awkwardly, e.g. while doing gymnastics, dived into a shallow pool and hit the bottom, fallen from a moving vehicle, e.g. a motorbike, or a horse, been in a collapsed rugby scrum, been in a motor vehicle which suddenly crashes, been hit by a heavy object falling across their back or had an injury to the head or face.</p>

                         <li>You need to support the head until emergency services can take over, no matter how long it takes for them to come. If there is someone who can help you, ask them to put rolled-up blankets, towels or clothes on either side of the head to help support it.</li>

                   <h3>Strains and sprains</h3>
                    <p>Strains and sprains are common injuries which affect the soft tissues around joints ‚Äì the muscles, tendons and ligaments. They happen when the tissues are stretched, twisted or torn by violent or sudden movements, for instance if someone changes direction suddenly, or falls and lands awkwardly. A sprain is when a ligament has been twisted or torn. A strain is when the muscle has been overstretched and has partially torn. (A rupture is when a muscle or tendon is completely torn).</p>

                   <h3>What to look for - strains and sprains</h3>
                   <p>If you think someone may have strained or sprained a muscle, ligament or tendon, these are the three key things to look for:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Pain and tenderness</li>
                        <li>Difficulty moving</li>
                        <li>Swelling and bruising</li>

                   <h3>What you need to do - strains and sprains</h3>
                    <p>Remember RICE for the four steps to deal with strains and sprains:</p>
                     <ol>
                         <li>Rest</li>
                         <li>Ice</li>
                        <li>Comfortable support</li>
                        <li>Elevation</li>

                     <p><b>Step 1 of 4: Rest</b></p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Help them to sit or lie down and support in a comfortable raised position the part they've hurt.</li>

                    <ul>
                         <li>To cool the area, apply a cold compress, like an ice pack or cold pad. This will help to reduce the swelling, bruising and pain. Do not leave on for more than ten minutes.</li>

                        <li>Leave the cold compress in place or wrap a soft layer of padding, e.g. cotton wool, around the area.
