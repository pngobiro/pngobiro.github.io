                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>In order to stay alive, all persons need to have an open airway-a clear passage where air can move in through the mouth or nose through the pharynx and down into the lungs, without obstruction. Conscious people will maintain their own airway automatically, but those who are unconscious (with a GCS of less than 8) may be unable to maintain a patent airway, as the part of the brain which automatically controls breathing in normal situations may not be functioning.</p>
                     <p>If the patient was breathing, a first aider would normally then place them in the recovery position, with the patient leant over on their side, which also has the effect of clearing the tongue from the pharynx. It also avoids a common cause of death in unconscious patients, which is choking on regurgitated stomach contents.</p>
                     <p>The airway can also become blocked through a foreign object becoming lodged in the pharynx or larynx, commonly called choking. The first aider will be taught to deal with this through a combination of 'back slaps' and 'abdominal thrusts'.</p>
                    <p>Once the airway has been opened, the first aider would assess to see if the patient is breathing. If there is no breathing, or the patient is not breathing normally, such as agonal breathing, the first aider would undertake what is probably the most recognized first aid procedure‚Äîcardiopulmonary resuscitation or CPR, which involves breathing for the patient, and manually massaging the heart to promote blood flow around the body.</p>

                <h2>üìö The role of a first aider</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>First aid is the help given to someone who is injured or ill, to keep them safe until they can get more advanced medical treatment by seeing a doctor, health professional or go to hospital.</p>
                    <p>The role of a first aider is to give someone this help, while making sure that they and anyone else involved are safe and that they don't make the situation worse.</p>
                     <p>If you think someone needs your help, these are the seven things you need to do as a first aider:</p>
                   <ol>
                        <li>Assess the situation quickly and calmly:</li>
                             <ul>
                                 <li>Safety: Are you or they in any danger? Is it safe for you to go up to them?</li>
                                 <li>Scene: What caused the accident or situation? How many casualties are there?</li>
                                <li>Situation: What's happened? How many people are involved and how old are they? What do you think the main injuries could be?</li>
                             </ul>
                        <li>Protect yourself and them from any danger:</li>
                              <ul>
                                   <li>Always protect yourself first - never put yourself at risk</li>
                                   <li>Only move them to safety if leaving them would cause them more harm</li>
                                  <li>If you can't make an area safe, call 999/112 for emergency help</li>
                              </ul>
                        <li>Prevent infection between you and them:</li>
                              <ul>
                                   <li>Wash your hands or use alcohol gel</li>
                                   <li>Wear disposable gloves</li>
                                   <li>Don't touch an open wound without gloves on</li>
                                   <li>Don't breathe, cough or sneeze over a wound or a casualty</li>
                              </ul>
                        <li>Comfort and reassure:</li>
                             <ul>
                                 <li>Stay calm and take charge of the situation</li>
                                 <li>Introduce yourself to them to help gain their trust</li>
                                 <li>Explain what's happening and why</li>
                                  <li>Say what you're going to do before you do it</li>
                             </ul>
                        <li>Assess the casualty:</li>

                                <li>If there's more than one casualty, help those with life-threatening conditions first</li>
                                <li>Start with the Primary Survey and deal with any life-threatening conditions</li>
                                <li>Then, if you've dealt with these successfully, move on to the Secondary Survey</li>
                             </ul>
                         <li>Give first aid treatment:</li>

                                  <li>Then move on to less serious ones</li>
                                  <li>Get help from others if possible</li>
                             </ul>
                        <li>Arrange for the right kind of help:</li>

                                <li>Call for an ambulance if you think it's serious</li>
                                <li>Take or send them to hospital if it's a serious condition but is unlikely to get worse</li>
                                <li>For a less serious condition call 111 for medical advice (in England)</li>
                                <li>Suggest they see their doctor if they're concerned about a less serious condition</li>
                                <li>Advise them to go home to rest, but to seek help if they feel worse</li>
                                <li>Stay with them until you can leave them in the right car</li>

               <h2>üìö How to assess a casualty</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>If you think someone needs your help, before you do anything you need to check the situation is safe and assess what's wrong with them. These checks are broken into two stages ‚Äì called The Primary and Secondary Survey:</p>
                    <p><b>The Primary Survey</b></p>
                     <p>First, you need to look and see if they have any injuries or conditions that could be immediately life-threatening, and deal with these as quickly as possible. To do this, the letters DR. ABC will help you to remember to check for Danger, Response, Airway, Breathing and Circulation.</p>
                    <p><b>The Secondary Survey</b></p>
                    <p>If you manage to deal with anything life-threatening successfully, or there is nothing life-threatening to deal with, then you can assess someone in more detail for any other injuries or conditions.</p>
                 </div>
            </section>
            <section class="content-section">
                 <h2>üìö The Primary Survey</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The Primary Survey is a quick way for you to find out if someone has any injuries or conditions which are life-threatening. If you follow each step methodically, you can identify each life-threatening condition and deal with it in order of priority.</p>
                     <p>Use the letters <b>DR. ABC</b> to remember the steps: <b>Danger, Response, Airway, Breathing and Circulation.</b></p>
                    <p>You'll need to go through the Primary Survey every time you help someone, and make sure you don't get distracted by anything else. Only move onto the Secondary Survey, if you've already done the Primary Survey and succeeded in dealing with any life-threatening conditions.</p>

                     <ul>
                         <li><b>No:</b> If you can see or hear any danger nearby, for you or them, like broken glass or oncoming traffic, then make the situation safe before you get any closer</li>
                         <li><b>Yes:</b> If you can't see or hear any danger then it is safe to go up to them.</li>

                    <h3>Response:</h3>
                    <p>Do they respond when you ask them: ‚ÄòAre you alright?' or if you say: 'Open your eyes!'</p>
                     <ul>
                         <li><b>No:</b> If they don't respond, pinch their ear lobe or gently shake their shoulders, or with a child - tap their shoulder, and with a baby - tap their foot. If they still don't respond, then you can presume they're unresponsive and move on to the next stage ‚Äì <b>Airway</b>. Someone who's unresponsive should always take priority so you should treat them first and as quickly as possible.</li>
                         <li><b>Yes:</b> If they respond by making eye contact with you or some gesture then you know that they're responsive and you can move on to the next stage ‚Äì <b>Airway.</b></li>
