                <div class="content-block">
                     <p>Bites from sharp, pointed teeth cause deep puncture wounds. This can damage tissues and let germs into the skin, so you need to treat any bite that breaks the skin, to stop it getting infected.</p>
                      <p>One infection someone might get from an animal bite is rabies, which is a serious viral infection that attacks the brain and nervous system. If an infected animal bites a human, they will pass on the virus, through their saliva. Almost all cases of rabies happen abroad. If someone hasn't been vaccinated, then rabies is nearly always fatal, so you need to send the casualty to hospital straight away. Tetanus (a bacterial infection) is also a potential risk after an animal bite.</p>

                    <h3>What you need to do - Animal bites</h3>
                    <ul>
                         <li>Wash the wound from the bite thoroughly with soap and warm water. This will reduce the risk of infection from an animal bite.</li>
                        <li>Raise and support the wound and pat it dry, preferably with clean gauze from your first aid kit. Then cover it with a sterile wound dressing.</li>
                        <li>If the wound is large or deep, then treat for bleeding and call for an ambulance.</li>
                         <li>If you think there's a risk of rabies, then you need to get them to hospital as fast as you can.</li>
                         <li>If the wound is dirty or they're not sure if there if they've had a tetanus jab, then tell them to see their doctor.</li>
                        <li>If the bite is from another human, there's also a small risk of getting hepatitis or HIV/AIDS viruses. This is much more unlikely but they should still see a doctor, in case.</li>

                <h2>üìö Blisters</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                     <p>Blisters are fluid-filled bumps that look like bubbles on the skin. They usually form when someone's skin repeatedly rubs against something or is exposed to heat. When someone gets a blister, the part of the skin that is damaged leaks fluid that collects under the top layer of the skin, forming the blister.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-block">
                   <h3>What to look for - Blisters</h3>
                    <p>Most blisters heal themselves within a few days. But seek medical help if:</p>
                    <ul>
                       <li>they are extremely painful</li>
                        <li>you think they may be infected, or</li>
                        <li>they keep coming back</li>

                     <h3>What you need to do - Blisters</h3>
                     <ul>
                        <li>If someone has a blister, don't burst it as this can increase the risk of infection.</li>
                       <li>Wash the skin around the blister with clean water.</li>
                         <li>Gently pat the skin dry with a sterile gauze pad or a clean, non-fluffy material.</li>
                       <li>If the blister was caused by something rubbing against the skin, cover it with a plaster ‚Äì ideally a special blister plaster, as these have a cushioned pad that gives extra protection.</li>
                     </ul>
                 </div>

                <h2>üìö Bumps and bruises</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                      <p>After someone has had an injury to the skin, they'll often get a bump or a bruise. Bumps and bruises may not appear straight away but the skin can still be painful and often feel tender or swollen at first. Bumps are swellings caused by fluid under the surface of the skin. Bruises are bluish or purple-coloured patches that appear because tiny blood vessels beneath the skin burst and leak blood into the soft tissue. As they heal, bruises usually change to a yellowish green colour.</p>
                </div>
                 <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>What you need to do</h3>
                    <ul>
                         <li>If someone has a bump or bruise, hold something cold onto the skin straight after the injury to help it heal and reduce the pain. This could be a bag of peas or ice wrapped in a cloth, or a cold compress if you have one. Do not leave it on for more than ten minutes.</li>
                         <li>If the injury is painful then help them to lie down and raise the area above their heart, if possible, to help slow the flow of blood to the area and so reduce the swelling.</li>
                         <li>If a bump or bruise becomes very swollen or very painful, then you should tell them to see a healthcare professional for advice.</li>

                <h2>üìö Burns and scalds</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                     <p>Burns and scalds are damage to the skin caused by heat. A burn is usually caused by dry heat, like fire, a hot iron, or the sun. A scald is caused by wet heat, like steam or a hot cup of tea. You need to be extra careful when treating burns. The longer the burning goes on, the more severe the injury will be, and the longer it may take to heal. So you need to cool the burn as soon as possible. If someone has a severe burn or scald they are likely to suffer from shock, because of the fluid loss, so they will need urgent hospital treatment.</p>
                 </div>
                 <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>What to look for</h3>
                     <p>If you think someone has a burn or scald, there are five key things to look for:</p>
                     <ol>
                        <li>Red skin</li>
                        <li>Swelling</li>
                        <li>Blisters may form on the skin later on</li>
                        <li>The skin may peel</li>
                        <li>The skin may be white or scorched</li>
                    </ol>
                 </div>
                 <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>What you need to do</h3>
                     <ul>
                       <li>Stop the burning getting any worse, by moving the casualty away from the source of heat.</li>
                        <li>Start cooling the burn as quickly as possible. Run it under cool water for at least ten minutes or until the pain feels better. (Don't use ice, creams or gels ‚Äì they can damage tissues and increase risk of infection).</li>
                         <li>Assess how bad the burn is. It is serious if it is:</li>
                           <ul>
                               <li>larger than the size of the casualty's hand</li>
                               <li>on the face, hands or feet, or</li>
                               <li>a deep burn</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>If it is serious, call 999 or 112 for emergency medical help.</li>
                       <li>Remove any jewellery or clothing near the burn (unless it is stuck to it).</li>
                        <li>Cover the burned area with kitchen cling film or another clean, non-fluffy material, like a clean plastic bag. This will protect from infection.</li>
                        <li>If necessary, treat for shock (shock is a life-threatening condition, not to be confused with emotional shock).</li>
                       <li>If you are unsure if the burn is serious then tell the person to see a doctor.</li>
                     </ul>

                <h2>üìö Frostbite</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                      <p>Frostbite happens when parts of the skin and other tissues freeze due to low temperatures. Frostbite usually affects the fingers and toes as they are the parts of the body furthest from the heart. If someone has severe frostbite then they might permanently lose all feeling in that part of their body. Frostbite can also lead to gangrene, when the blood vessels and soft tissues become permanently damaged leading to death of the tissue. Frostbite usually happens in freezing or cold and windy weather. People who cannot move around are more likely to get it. Someone with frostbite will probably have hypothermia, so be prepared to treat them for that too.</p>
                 </div>
                 <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>What to look for - frostbite</h3>
                     <p>If you think someone has frostbite, there are four key things to look for:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>‚ÄòPins and needles' to begin with</li>
                        <li>Paleness, followed by numbness</li>
                        <li>Hardening and stiffening of the skin</li>
                         <li>Change in skin colour: first white, then blotchy and blue. On recovery, the skin may be red, hot, painful and blistered. If they get gangrene, the tissue may become black due to the loss of blood supply and death of the tissue.</li>
                    </ol>
                 </div>
                  <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>What you need to do - frostbite</h3>
                    <ul>
                         <li>First, encourage them to put their hands in their armpits. Then help move them indoors or to somewhere warm.</li>
                        <li>Once inside, gently remove anything constricting like rings, gloves or boots.</li>
                       <li>Next, warm the body part with your hands on your lap, or under their armpits. Don't rub it though because this could damage their skin tissue. (If there is a danger of it refreezing then don't warm it up yet as this can cause more damage).</li>
                        <li>Place the body part in warm (not hot) water at around 40¬∞C (104¬∞F) and be careful not to put it near direct heat as this can cause more damage. Dry it carefully and put on a light dressing, ideally a gauze bandage from your first aid kit.</li>
                        <li>Once you've done that, help them to raise their limb to reduce swelling, with cushions or a sling for instance.</li>
                        <li>Advise them to take some painkillers if they have some (paracetamol for example).</li>
                        <li>Then take or send them to hospital, keeping their limb raised.</li>

                <h2>üìö Fainting</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Fainting is when someone briefly loses responsiveness, often causing the person fall to the ground. It happens because for a moment there is not enough blood flowing to the brain. People often faint as a reaction to pain, exhaustion, hunger, or emotional stress. It is also common after someone has been standing or sitting still for a long period of time, especially if they're feeling hot.</p>
                     <p>When someone faints, their pulse slows right down but it usually picks up and goes back to normal soon afterwards. If someone who's fainted doesn't come round after a couple of minutes, then this could be more serious.</p>

                         <li>Kneel down next to them and raise their legs, supporting their ankles on your shoulders to help blood flow back to the brain. Watch their face for signs that they're recovering.</li>
                       <li>Make sure that they have plenty of fresh air ‚Äì ask bystanders to move away and if you're inside then ask someone to open a window.</li>
                       <li>Reassure the casualty and help them to sit up slowly.</li>
                       <li>If they don't regain responsiveness again quickly, open their airway, check their breathing and prepare to treat someone who is unresponsive.</li>

                 <div class="content-block">
                      <p>A fever is a high temperature. When someone's body temperature goes above the normal body temperature of 37¬∞C (98. 6¬∞F), this is called a fever. Usually fevers are caused by infections or illnesses, such as a sore throat, earache, or chickenpox. Fevers are common in children and, though worrying for parents, they often go away without treatment. But if a young child's temperature goes above 39¬∞C (102. 2¬∞F) this can be dangerous and might trigger a seizure (fit).</p>

                     <p>Early signs of fever:</p>
                     <ol>
                        <li>High temperature - above 37¬∞C (98. 6¬∞F)</li>
                         <li>Pale skin</li>
                         <li>They may feel cold, with goose pimples, shivering and chattering teeth</li>
                     </ol>
                     <p>Then, later:</p>
                      <ol>
                         <li>Hot, flushed skin and sweating</li>
                        <li>Headache</li>

                    <h3>What you need to do - Fever</h3>
                    <ul>
                       <li>If you notice some of these symptoms, take their temperature using a thermometer.</li>
                       <li>If their temperature is above 37¬∞C, it's a fever.</li>
