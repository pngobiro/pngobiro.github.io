                 <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Choking is when your airway gets blocked and you can't breathe properly. When someone chokes, the airway can either be partly or fully blocked. If it's a mild blockage, they should be able to clear it themselves by coughing. If it's a severe blockage, they won't be able to cough so without anyone's help they'll become unresponsive.</p>
                    <p>But if they do become unresponsive, their throat muscles could relax and open the airway enough for you to give rescue breaths ‚Äì be prepared to give rescue breaths and chest compressions.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                     <h3>Choking adult ‚Äì what to look for</h3>
                    <p>If you think someone is choking, ask them: ‚ÄòAre you choking?' to check they're not suffering from something else. Can they speak, cry, cough or breathe?</p>
                    <p>If they can, they should be able to clear their throat on their own by coughing, so encourage them to cough.</p>
                    <p>If they can't cough or make any noise, it's serious.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Encourage them to cough. If this doesn't clear the obstruction, support their upper body with one hand and help them lean forward.</li>

                     <p><b>Step 2 of 4: Slap it out</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If coughing doesn't work, help the casualty bend forward.</li>
                         <li>Use the heel of your hand to give up to five sharp back blows between their shoulder blades.</li>
                         <li>Check their mouth to see if there's anything in there and, if there is, get them to pick it out.</li>

                 <h2>üìö Croup in children</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                <p>Croup is a childhood condition that makes it difficult to breathe. Croup is caused by the inflammation of the windpipe (trachea) and the voice box (larynx). Children with croup have difficulty breathing, a distinctive barking cough and may have a croaky voice.</p>
                <p>Croup can usually be diagnosed by a GP and treated at home. If an attack of croup is severe and doesn't go away, call 999 or 112 for emergency help.</p>
               <p>There is a small risk that they may have a rare but similar condition called epiglottitis. The epiglottis is a small flap of tissue at the base of the tongue which keeps food from going down the windpipe when swallowing. If this gets infected and swollen it can block the airway.</p>
                <p>If you think a child might have epiglottitis, it's a medical emergency and you need to call 999 or 112 immediately.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-block">
                     <h3>What to look for - croup</h3>
                    <p>If you think a child may have croup, these are the four key things to look for:</p>
                    <ol>
                         <li>Distressed breathing</li>
                         <li>A short barking cough</li>
                         <li>Rasping noise and croaky voice</li>
                         <li>Blue-grey skin</li>
                     </ol>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>What you need to do - croup</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stay calm and don't panic, as this will alarm them and probably make the attack of croup worse.</li>
                        <li>Sit them on your knee, supporting their back, and reassure them calmly.</li>
                         <li>If the croup is severe, call 999 or 112 for emergency medical help.</li>
                         <li>If they have a high temperature too, then suspect epiglottitis and call 999 or 112 immediately.</li>
                        <li>When you're waiting for help to arrive, keep checking the child's breathing, pulse and level of response.</li>

                <h2>üìö Drowning</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Drowning is when someone is unable to breathe because their nose and mouth are submerged in water, or in another liquid. When someone's drowning, it may not look like the violent, splashing call for help that most people expect from watching TV. When someone's actually drowning, they won't able to make any noise, so can easily go unnoticed, even if friends or family are nearby.</p>

                   <h3>What to look for - Drowning</h3>
                   <p>If someone has been rescued from drowning you need to check if they're breathing or not.</p>
                    <p>If they aren't breathing, then you'll need to give CPR (cardio pulmonary resuscitation) straight away.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>What you need to do - Drowning</h3>
                    <ul>
                         <li>As soon as the casualty has been rescued from the water, check if they're breathing.</li>
                         <li>Ask someone to call 999 or 112 for medical help.</li>
                         <li>If the person is unresponsive and not breathing, give them five initial rescue breaths before starting CPR.</li>
                         <li>Once you've done this, start CPR: 30 chest compressions, then two rescue breaths. Keep giving CPR until help arrives, the casualty regains responsiveness, or you're too exhausted to keep going.</li>
                          <li>If they start breathing again at any time, treat them for hypothermia by covering them with warm clothes and blankets. If they recover completely, replace their wet clothes with dry ones.</li>
                          <li>Keep checking breathing, pulse and level of response until help arrives.</li>

                <h2>üìö Hyperventilation</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Hyperventilation is excessive breathing, normally caused by extreme anxiety, and can happen at the same time as a panic attack. When someone is hyperventilating they breathe unnaturally fast or deep. This makes the blood lose more carbon dioxide than usual, which can make them feel weak and dizzy. As they begin to breathe normally again, they should feel better.</p>
                     <p>It is very rare for children to suffer from hyperventilation, so if you think a child is hyperventilating you should try looking for other reasons why they could be showing these symptoms.</p>

                        <li>Take them somewhere that's quiet, as this can help them control their breathing again. If you can't do this, ask any bystanders to leave or turn away.</li>
                        <li>Encourage the casualty to see their doctor about how they can learn to prevent and control hyperventilation in the future.</li>
