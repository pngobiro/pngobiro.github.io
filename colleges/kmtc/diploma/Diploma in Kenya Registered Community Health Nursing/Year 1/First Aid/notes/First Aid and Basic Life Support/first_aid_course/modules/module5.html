                     <h3>Asthma attack</h3>
                     <p>In an asthma attack, the muscles of the air passages in the lungs go into spasm. This makes the airways narrower, making it difficult to breathe.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes something specific can trigger an attack, such as an allergy, a cold, or cigarette smoke. At other times, someone may have a sudden attack with no obvious trigger.</p>
                    <p>People with asthma usually deal with their own attacks by using a blue reliever inhaler at the first sign of an attack. But if someone doesn't have an inhaler, or the attack is severe, you may need to help.</p>
                     <h3>What to look for - Asthma attacks</h3>
                     <p>If you think someone is having an asthma attack, these are the five key things to look for:</p>
