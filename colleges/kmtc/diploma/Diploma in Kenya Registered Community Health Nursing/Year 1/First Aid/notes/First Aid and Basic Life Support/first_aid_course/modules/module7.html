                   <p>In this section you can find out what to do about bleeding and blood loss. You can learn how to give first aid treatment for cuts, grazes, and nose bleeds as well as finding out what to do if someone is bleeding severely.</p>
                     <p>You can usually control bleeding from cuts and grazes by elevating the wound and applying pressure.</p>
                     <p>A nose bleed can be serious if someone loses a lot of blood ‚Äì and severe bleeding can cause distress, lead to shock and loss of responsiveness. This advice will help to give you the confidence to know what to do when a person is bleeding severely.</p>

                     <h3>Cuts and grazes</h3>
                    <p>Cuts and grazes are common injuries that can usually be treated at home. A cut is when the skin is fully broken, and a graze is when only the top layers of skin are scraped off. Usually, all you need to do is clean the cut or graze to reduce infection and apply pressure and raise the injury to stop the bleeding. The wound should heal by itself in a few days.</p>

                 <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>What to look for - Cuts and grazes</h3>
                    <p>If the bleeding doesn't stop, or if there's a foreign object in the cut, or you think it might be infected, then you should tell them to see a health care professional.</p>
                </div>
                 <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>What to do - Cuts and grazes</h3>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Clean the wound by rinsing it under running water or using alcohol-free wipes.</li>
                        <li>Pat it dry using a gauze swab and cover it with sterile gauze. If you don't have these, then use a clean, non-fluffy cloth.</li>
                        <li>Raise and support the part of the body that's injured. If it's a hand or arm, raise it above the head. If it's a lower limb, lay them down and raise the cut area above the level of the heart. This will help stop the bleeding.</li>
                         <li>Remove the gauze covering the wound and apply a sterile dressing.</li>
                        <li>If you think there's any risk of infection then suggest they see a health care professional.</li>
                     </ul>

                  <div class="content-block">
                     <h3>Nose bleeds</h3>
                    <p>A nose bleed is when blood flows from one or both nostrils. It's normally caused by the tiny blood vessels inside the nostrils being ruptured. Common causes of nose bleeds include a blow to the nose, sneezing, picking or blowing the nose, and high blood pressure.</p>
                 </div>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>What to look for - Nose bleeds</h3>
                   <p>Most nose bleeds are minor and only last a few minutes, but they can be dangerous if someone loses a lot of blood. If someone has had a blow to the head, the blood may appear thin and watery. This could mean that their skull is fractured and fluid is leaking from around the brain. If that happens, it is very serious and you should call 999 or 112 for emergency medical help. See advice for head injuries.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>What to do - Nose bleeds</h3>
                    <ul>
                         <li>If someone is having a nose bleed, your priority is to control the bleeding and keep their airway open.</li>
                         <li>Get them to sit down (not lie down) as keeping the nose above the heart will reduce bleeding.</li>
                         <li>Get them to lean forward (not backwards), to make sure the blood drains out through their nose, rather than down their throat which could block their airway.</li>
                         <li>Ask them to breathe through their mouth and pinch the soft part of the nose, taking a brief pause every ten minutes, until the bleeding stops.</li>
                         <li>Encourage them not to speak, swallow, cough, spit or sniff because this may break blood clots that may have started to form in the nose.</li>
                         <li>If the bleeding is severe, or if it lasts more than 30 minutes, call 999 or 112 for medical help.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>Shock</h3>
                    <p>Shock (not to be confused with emotional shock) is a life-threatening condition which happens when the body isn't getting enough flow of blood.</p>
                 </div>
                 <div class="content-block">
                   <h3>What to look for - shock</h3>
                   <p>If you think somebody could be suffering from shock, there are seven key things to look for:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Paleness of the face (pallor)</li>
                        <li>Cold, clammy skin</li>
                        <li>Fast, shallow breathing</li>
                        <li>Fast, weak pulse</li>
                        <li>Yawning or sighing</li>
                        <li>Confusion</li>
                        <li>Loss of response (in extreme cases)</li>
                    </ol>
                 </div>
                 <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>What you need to do - shock</h3>
                    <p>If they are showing signs of shock:</p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Lay them down with their head low and legs raised and supported, to increase the flow of blood to their head. Do not raise an injured leg.</li>
                         <li>Call 999 or 112 for medical help and say you think they are in shock, and explain what you think caused it (such as bleeding or a heart attack).</li>
                         <li>Loosen any tight clothing around the neck, chest and waist to make sure it doesn't constrict their blood flow</li>
                         <li>Fear and pain can make shock worse, by increasing the body's demand for oxygen, so while you wait for help to arrive, it's important to keep them comfortable, warm and calm. Do this by covering them with a coat or blanket and comforting and reassuring them</li>
                         <li>Keep checking their breathing, pulse and level of response.</li>
                           <li>If they become unresponsive at any point, open their airway, check their breathing, and prepare to treat someone who has become unresponsive.</li>
                    </ul>
