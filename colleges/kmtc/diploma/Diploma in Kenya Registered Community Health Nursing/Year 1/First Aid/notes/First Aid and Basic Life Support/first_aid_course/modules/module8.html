                     <ul>

                          <li>unresponsiveness</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>If they are unresponsive, you also need to look for:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>shallow breathing</li>
                        <li>weak, rapid pulse</li>

                        <li>Don't make them be sick as this could block their airway and stop them from breathing.</li>
                        <li>If you're unsure about how serious their condition is then call 999 or 112 for medical help.</li>
                         <li>If they lose responsiveness at any point, open their airway, check their breathing and prepare to treat someone who's become unresponsive.</li>

                      <h3>Food poisoning</h3>
                    <p>Caused by eating contaminated food. Food poisoning is caused by eating contaminated food. In most cases the food hasn't been cooked properly and is contaminated by bacteria such as salmonella or Escherichia coli (E. coli), which are found mainly in meat. Someone may feel the effects of food poisoning within a few hours, and will often be sick or have diarrhoea. However, in some cases it can take up to three days. The effects of food poisoning can make someone feel extremely ill. The most important thing is for you to keep encouraging the person to drink water so they don't get dehydrated. Most people will get better without needing treatment.</p>

                         <li>Feeling sick</li>
                          <li>Vomiting, sometimes bloodstained</li>

                     <h3>What you need to do - Food poisoning</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you notice any of these symptoms, tell the person to lie down and rest.</li>
                        <li>Give them plenty of water and a bowl to use in case they are sick.</li>
                        <li>Encourage them to drink as much water as they can, even if they can only manage regular small sips. If they have diarrhoea, it's even more important that they drink water to replace lost fluids.</li>
                        <li>Giving them an oral rehydration solution is good to way to replace fluids lost through diarrhoea and vomiting. This solution can replace salt and other minerals which they have lost. You can buy it in a pharmacy as a sachet which you dissolve in water.</li>
                        <li>If the person gets worse, then advise them to call their doctor or call 999 or 112 for emergency medical help.</li>

                     <h3>Carbon Monoxide poisoning</h3>
                    <p>Caused by inhalation of this deadly gas. If volumes of smoke or gas are inhaled or breathed in, it can be deadly. If a casualty has inhaled fumes they need immediate medical attention as they are likely to have low levels of oxygen in their blood and tissues. Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas. When inhaled, the gas directly prevents the red blood cells from carrying oxygen to the body's tissues and organs. It can quickly prove fatal if it is inhaled in large amounts, for example from vehicle exhaust fumes or smoke within a confined space, or even in small amounts, for example due to leakage of fumes from a faulty boiler or heater. Carbon monoxide is difficult to detect as it has no taste or smell. Unfortunately, lots of people who have carbon monoxide poisoning may not be aware that they are affected and may wrongly blame their symptoms on other reasons. The young and the old are at increased risk. It is best to reduce the risk of poisoning by making sure that gas appliances are serviced regularly and by fitting an approved carbon monoxide detector in your home.</p>

                     <p>When someone ingests poisonous substances, such as: chemicals, drugs, plants, fungi or berries. Poisons are substances that can cause temporary or permanent damage if too much is absorbed by the body. Poisons can be swallowed, inhaled, injected or absorbed through the skin. Swallowed poisons include chemicals, drugs, plants, fungi and berries. For more on drugs, see drug poisoning. Dangerous chemicals include household products like bleach, which can poison or burn the body if swallowed. Poisonous plants include foxgloves, wild arum and certain types of mushroom. Eating laburnum seeds can cause seizures. Drugs, both prescribed or those bought over the counter, can also be harmful if someone takes too many.</p>
