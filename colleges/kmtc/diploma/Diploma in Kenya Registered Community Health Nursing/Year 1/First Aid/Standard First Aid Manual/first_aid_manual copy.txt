\section*{1.1 - Definition and Aims of First Aid}

\section*{WHAT IS FIRST AID?}

First Aid is the immediate management of a person who is injured or has suddenly taken ill.

\section*{AIMS OF FIRST AID}

The four aims of First Aid are:
1. To preserve life.
a. Provide chest compressions/CPR if casualty is not breathing normally.
b. Control any serious bleeding.
2. To prevent condition from worsening.
a. Cover wounds.
b. Immobilise open wounds and fractures.
c. Place casualty in a comfortable position.
3. To promote recovery.
4. To provide comfort and relief.
a. Relieve pain and discomfort.
b. Reassure and comfort.
c. Protect casualty from extreme heat or cold.

\section*{1.2 - Roles and Limitations of a First Aider}

The roles of a First Aider:
1. Provide First Aid to the casualty until medical help arrives.
2. As a First Aider, you should:
- Be familiar with the layout of places frequented, eg. workplace, home, school, shopping malls, etc.
- Understand the processes and associated hazards before embarking on any work/activity to anticipate possible types of incidents and be prepared to render appropriate First Aid.
- Take note of the casualty's condition, type and time of treatment provided and basic details of the casualty. A more detailed report may be required in workplaces or schools; therefore, it is important for the First Aider (employed/contracted) to be familiar with the documentation and reporting procedure of the organisation.
- Periodically check that the First Aid kit and contents are in order and are replenished regularly.
3. However, for appointed First Aiders with duty of care within the organisation/workplace:
- You may be required to administer prescribed medication, based on the organisation/workplace Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) to the casualty with the diagnosed condition.
- You may refer to the Workplace Safety and Health Act to understand the details of the specific roles and responsibilities. (https://www.mom.gov.sg/workplace-safety-and-health/workplace-safety-and-health-act and https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/WSHA2006)

The limitations of a First Aider:
1. A First Aider should not be prescribing any medication to the casualty.
2. Please seek consent before administering First Aid treatment. Deemed consent will apply to casualties who are unconscious.

\section*{1.3 - Universal Precautions}

Infections by blood-borne pathogens may be transmitted during life saving activities.

Use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (see figure 1) whenever possible while

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-009.jpg?height=380&width=864&top_left_y=434&top_left_x=913}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 1 - Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)}
\end{figure}
providing First Aid. Examples are:
1. Keep open wounds covered with dressings to prevent contact with blood.
2. Use disposable latex/nitrile gloves in every situation involving blood or other body fluids. If disposable latex/nitrile gloves are not available, use the most waterproof material or extra gauze dressing to form an impervious barrier.
3. Whenever possible, use a mouth-to-barrier device with a one-way valve for protection when performing ventilations (if trained) as there may be blood, vomit, body fluids or unknown contaminants in the casualty's mouth.
4. Wash the area immediately with soap and running water when exposed to blood or other body fluids and dispose of soiled items appropriately.
5. Wash hands with soap and water thoroughly (see figure 2) after the incident, as soon as possible.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 2 - Hand Washing Technique}
\end{figure}

\section*{1.4 - First Aid Kit Content and Maintenance}

Appointed First Aiders must be familiar with the First Aid kit's location, content and usage.

First Aid kit should not contain materials other than those required for First Aid treatment (see figure 3). It is essential that First Aid kit be checked frequently to make sure they are fully equipped, and all items are usable. Used or expired items should be replaced as soon as possible.

Medication should not be stored in the First Aid Kit. Co-workers/staff or residents with diagnosed conditions may carry life-saving medication with them. The First Aider will need to know how to assist the casualty when their condition is triggered.

The number of First Aid kit required depends on the physical layout of the premises and the number of people within the premises.

The First Aid kit should be adequately equipped, properly maintained, checked regularly, identifiable and placed in a well-lit and accessible location, under the charge of a person appointed by the workplace or organisation.

\section*{1.5 - Primary Survey}

As an emergency is a sudden unexpected event that creates a risk to life and limb. Rapid action is necessary to rescue the casualty. This would require an immediate but systematic plan to ensure the safety of the casualty and self, as well as to perform triage of the casualty to determine the priority required to save a life. Thus, an Emergency Action Plan is needed, which comprises of two main portions - Primary and Secondary Surveys.

\section*{Factors to consider when carrying out Primary Survey}
1. Environmental conditions

Assess dangers and difficulties in removing the casualty:
a. Moving vehicles
b. Fumes and poisonous gases
c. Unsafe structures
d. Trapped casualty
2. Hazards
a. Look out for fire, smoke, faulty electrical wires, spilled water, etc.
b. Unseen dangers such as toxic gases, risk of falling objects, etc.
3. Mechanisms of injury

Try to find out the mechanism of injury. This helps to identify the extent of injuries:
a. Fall from height - look for multiple fractures.
b. Ejection from a vehicle - look for multiple injuries.
c. Sudden deceleration - look for blunt abdominal or chest injury due to these areas hitting the steering wheel.

\section*{The Primary Survey}

The Primary Survey (see figure 4) comprises of the following 6 steps:
- Danger - Ensure personal safety
- Response - Check for casualty's responsiveness
- Shout for Help - Get help and call 995 for Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), which will dispatch the appropriate resources for the incident
- AED - Have a nearby AED brought to the casualty
- Breathing - Look for normal breathing
- Chest Compressions - Start Chest Compressions if breathing is absent or unsure

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-014.jpg?height=749&width=1766&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=162}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 4 - The Primary Survey (DRSABC)}
\end{figure}

The purpose of the Primary Survey is to ensure that the casualty receives immediate priority and treatment for life-threatening conditions:
- If casualty is unresponsive but breathing normally, check and manage any external injuries found. Monitor the casualty regularly (see Chapter 2).
- If casualty is bleeding severely, apply direct pressure on the wound. Apply a tourniquet if a limb is amputated and record the time of application (see Chapter 4).
- If casualty is unresponsive and not breathing, start chest compressions and apply an AED (see Chapter 8).

\section*{Rapid Body Survey}

Do a head-to-toe examination of the body to look for injuries, bleeding and wounds:
1. Check for external bleeding/deformities at:
a. Head and neck.
b. Chest and abdomen.
c. Back and lower extremities.
d. Upper extremities.
2. Expose and examine the injury site.
3. Provide appropriate emergency care accordingly: Arrest bleeding, cover wounds and immobilise fractures.

\section*{1.6 - Secondary Survey}

The Secondary Survey should be performed after the Primary Survey has been conducted and when casualty's life is not in any immediate danger. The information collected should be passed on to the paramedics who are taking over the care of the casualty. The Secondary Survey covers the following:
1. History.
2. Vital Signs.
3. Head-to-toe examination.

\section*{History}
1. Chief complaint
- What did the casualty say?
2. Details of chief complaint
- Note the following:
- Location and description of injury.
- Nature of pain.
3. Medical History
- Previous health and/or history of illness.
- Previous/current treatment given by a doctor.
- Allergies - any sensitivity to drugs, food or environment.
- Check for Medic Alert Tag or Medic AWAS Card.

\section*{Vital Signs}

Assess the following four vital signs after Primary Survey and Secondary Survey at regular intervals. Record the time and information collected. Additional information may be collected if the supporting
1. Check the level of consciousness (AVPU) (see figure 5)
- The casualty is alert and

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-015.jpg?height=627&width=697&top_left_y=1901&top_left_x=1102}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5 - AVPU Scale}
\end{figure}
conscious.
- The casualty responds to verbal stimulation.
- The casualty responds to painful stimulus.
- The casualty is completely unresponsive.
2. Pulse rate
- Assess the rate, rhythm and strength.
3. Breathing rate
- Look for normal breathing which is regular and not laboured.
- Assess the rate, rhythm and depth.
4. Skin colour
- Normal skin is pink, warm and dry.
- When in shock, the skin may appear pale/bluish grey, cold and sweaty.

\section*{Head-to-toe Examination}

Examine the body in the same order as Rapid Body Survey except more time is taken to confirm any abnormalities - injury, wounds and deformities.

This includes sorting of casualty (Triage) by:
1. Priority of attention.
2. Urgency for evacuation.
3. Evacuation and transport.

\section*{1. Priority of attention}
a. Unconscious casualties - Check that there is normal breathing. Place casualty in recovery position (see Chapter 2) if spinal/head injuries are not suspected.
b. Serious casualties - Chest Injury (Injury to the respiratory or cardiovascular system); head injuries but conscious; fractures and wounds.
c. Minor injuries: minor wounds.

\section*{2. Urgency for evacuation}
a. Urgent evacuation - All unconscious casualties, all casualties with chest or abdominal wounds, all casualties with head injuries.
b. Less urgent evacuation - Other wounds and fractures.
c. Non-urgent evacuation - Walking injured, minor injuries.

\section*{3. Evacuation and transportation plan}
a. Stretcher for spinal injury, multiple injuries, chest and abdominal wounds.
b. One rescuer assisted evacuation, two or three rescuers assisted evacuation for casualties who are unable to walk unsupported but are conscious; an alternative is to use a chair to evacuate the casualty.

\section*{1.7 - Record and Report}

When Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers arrive, you will be required to provide some basic information regarding the incident and the treatment provided. If in doubt, take que from the SCDF Officer's instructions. Additionally, your workplace may require you to provide a written report follow your workplace's reporting process.

The following pointers can be used as a reference:
1. Scene of incident - Hazards, site location, etc.
2. Mechanism of injury if known - Look at circumstances in which injury was sustained, extent and type of injuries sustained due to impact.
3. History: chief complaint and the details - Symptoms of illness or trauma; any past allergies; any past medical conditions.
4. Provide a written report (if required by your workplace) covering the following:
a. Casualty's name, department and staff ID (if any).
b. History of the incident or illness.
c. Vital signs - Note level of consciousness, pulse, breathing and skin colour.
d. Any unusual behaviour.
e. Any treatment given and when - List all first aid treatment given. Record injuries from head to toe. Use a diagram (see figure 6).
f. Response - Note response to treatment (eg.

Reduction of pain, improved level of consciousness, etc).
g. Progress - Note the change of vital signs if any.

\section*{1.8 - SCDF's myResponder Mobile Application}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-019.jpg?height=449&width=1543&top_left_y=368&top_left_x=251)

In Singapore, many of the emergency cases SCDF responds to could be quickly attended to by members of the public even before SCDF's arrival. For example, more than 2,500 people suffer from Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA), with a survival rate of just $5 \%$, which could be improved by simple medical intervention within the first few critical minutes. At the same time, there are more than 1,000 minor fires (such as rubbish chute/bin fire) that could easily be extinguished using publicly-available means.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Cardiac Arrest & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Accept the myResponder alert, and proceed to the given location \\
- You may use the app to locate nearby AEDs \\
- Upon arrival at the patient's side, perform CPR, or apply an AED \\
- Hand-over the case to the SCDF paramedics when they arrive
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Minor Fire & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Accept the myResponder alert, and proceed to the given location \\
- Extinguish the fire using available means, such as nearby extinguishers, buckets of water, domestic water taps and hoses, or drencher systems for rubbish chutes \\
- Provide SCDF with up to 3 photos for scene assessment
\end{tabular} \\
\hline & - Accept the myResponder alert, but do not proceed any closer to the given location \\
\hline Major Incident & - Provide SCDF with up to 3 photos and 1 video of the developing incident, if it is safe to do so \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
myResponder is an application by SCDF to alert members of the public to nearby fire and medical cases, and thereby save lives and increase the survival rate for OHCA, as well as mitigate minor fires in the first few critical minutes.
myResponder is also a means by which members of the public may be asked to provide onsite information (via submission of photos and videos) for SCDF to gain an understanding of the situation. Through the 'Call 995' button in the app, users can also send their geolocation to SCDF's 995 Operations Centre, enabling SCDF to dispatch the emergency resources to the scene sooner.
myResponder works by notifying members of the public - also known as Community First Responders (CFRs) - of cardiac arrest and fire cases within 400 m of their location. myResponder will also highlight nearby AEDs that may be available to responders, and provide guided advisories in the mitigation of minor fires. CFRs can then proceed to the stated location and assist by performing CPR or applying an AED to revive the patient, mitigating minor fires using available extinguishing means, or providing further information to SCDF's 995 Operations Centre.

Response is entirely voluntary, and we only encourage volunteers to respond when they are available within safe and reasonable means.

\section*{Definition of Unconsciousness}

Unconsciousness is defined as impairment of awareness. It can range from drowsiness and confusion to total lack of response.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-022.jpg?height=732&width=861&top_left_y=565&top_left_x=593}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 7 - The basic structure of the brain}
\end{figure}

Frontal lobe - The frontal lobes are involved in motor function, problem solving, spontaneity, memory, language, initiation, judgement, impulse control, and social and sexual behaviour.

Parietal lobe - The parietal lobe receives and processes sensory information from all over the body and are also important for understanding spatial orientation and for proper navigation.

Temporal lobe - The temporal lobe is involved in primary auditory perception, such as hearing, and holds the primary auditory cortex.

Occipital lobe - The occipital lobe is responsible for processing visual information from the eyes.

Pons - The pons helps to regulate the respiratory system by assisting the medulla oblongata in controlling breathing rate and is also involved in the control of sleep cycles and the regulation of deep sleep. It also inhibits movement during sleep.

Cerebellum - The cerebellum coordinates voluntary movements such as posture, balance, coordination, and speech, resulting in smooth and balanced muscular activity.

Medulla Oblongata - The medulla oblongata helps regulate breathing, heart and blood vessel function, digestion, sneezing, and swallowing.

Spinal Cord - Its three major roles are to relay messages from the brain to different parts of the body, to perform an action, to pass along messages from sensory receptors to the brain, and to coordinate reflexes that are managed by the spinal cord alone.

\section*{Causes}

Unconsciousness can be due to:
- Cardiac Arrest
- Head injury
- Electrocution
- Poisoning
- Drowning
- Fainting
- Fits
- Stroke
- Low blood sugar
- Alcohol/drug related causes

\section*{Important Notes}
- Ensure the scene is safe to enter.
- Call 995 for SCDF.
- Do not give the casualty anything by mouth.
- Do not move the casualty unnecessarily.
- Treat any obvious injuries.
- Perform the Primary Survey. If casualty is unresponsive and not breathing, start chest compressions and apply an AED (see Chapter 8).
- If the casualty is breathing normally on his/her own, place in the recovery position to keep the airway clear. However, do not turn or move the casualty if neck or spinal injury is suspected (see chapter 2.1 on page 19) - based on the how the injury was sustained, and the force or height involved.
- Do not leave the casualty unattended at any time. Monitor the casualty and record the vital signs at regular intervals.

\section*{2.1 - Head/Spinal Injuries}

\section*{2.2 - Heat Disorders}

Heat disorders are a group of physically related illnesses caused by prolonged exposure to hot temperatures, insufficient fluid intake, or failure of temperature regulating mechanisms of the body. Disorders of heat exposure include heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. Proper rest, hydration, warm-up and acclimatisation before any strenuous activity is crucial in helping to prevent heat disorders.

\section*{Recognition}

\section*{Heat Cramps:}
- Over-exertion of a particular muscle group
- Lack of warm-up activity
- Insufficient water intake

\section*{Heat Exhaustion:}
- Severe tiredness due to loss of body fluid through excessive sweating from strenuous activity
- Muscle cramps in legs, arms or abdomen
- Weakness, dizziness or headache
- Pale, clammy skin
- Rapid pulse and breathing
- Nausea or vomiting

\section*{Heat Stroke:}
- The body temperature rises while the sweating mechanism fails, and the body is unable to cool down. Body temperature may rise above $40^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ due to:
- Prolonged heat exposure
- Insufficient water intake
- Throbbing headache, dizziness and acute discomfort
- Restlessness and confusion
- Hot, flushed and dry skin
- Rapid and weak pulse
- May lead to unconsciousness

\section*{Actions to Take}

\section*{Heat cramps:}
$\checkmark$ Stop all activity and sit in a cool place.
$\checkmark$ Drink enough water.
$\checkmark$ Seek medical attention if the cramps do not subside in 1 hour.
$\checkmark$ Do not return to strenuous activity for 2 hours after the cramps subside.

\section*{Heat Exhaustion:}
$\checkmark$ Help to move casualty to a cool place and lay him/her down.
$\checkmark$ Remove clothing if possible.
$\checkmark$ Monitor and record vital signs and level of consciousness regularly.

$\checkmark$ Casualty may not be fully conscious, do not feed the casualty anything.
$\checkmark$ Monitor and record vital signs and level of consciousness regularly.

\section*{2.3 - Fits}

Fits is the uncontrolled shaking of limbs and disturbance of consciousness. Anyone having two or more unprovoked fits or seizures can be said to have Epilepsy and it may vary widely in its forms, causation and severity.

\section*{Recognition}
- Involuntary contractions of many of the muscles, caused by a disturbance in the function of the brain.

\section*{Actions to Take}
$\checkmark$ Perform the Primary Survey. If casualty is unresponsive and not breathing, start chest compressions and apply an AED (see Chapter 8).
$\checkmark$ If the casualty is breathing normally on his/her own, place in the recovery position to keep the airway clear. However, do not turn or move the casualty if neck or spinal injury is suspected.
$\checkmark$ Support or ease their fall and lay the casualty down in a quiet place.
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ Remove any possible sources of harm.
$\checkmark$ Do not attempt to insert anything into the casualty's mouth.
$\checkmark$ Turn the casualty to the side to allow drainage of fluids from the mouth.
$\checkmark$ Stay with the casualty.
$\checkmark$ After the fits has stopped, ensure casualty is breathing normally and has no severe injuries before placing in the recovery position.

\section*{2.4 - Fainting}

Fainting is the temporary loss of consciousness in response to sever pain, unpleasant sights, prolonged standing or hunger.

\section*{Recognition}
- Sudden loss of consciousness.
- May have warning symptoms of dizziness.

\section*{Actions to Take}
$\checkmark$ Lay the casualty on a flat surface with legs elevated if there is no evidence of trauma.
$\checkmark$ Loosen tight clothing.
$\checkmark$ Check breathing and pulse.
$\checkmark$ Advise the casualty to seek medical attention.

\section*{2.5 - Low Blood Sugar}

Loss of consciousness can be due to a lack of blood sugar. While it can occur to casualties who are diabetic, it may also affect any person who had insufficient food intake.

\section*{Recognition}
- Rapid loss of consciousness.
- The casualty has not taken any food after their diabetes medication or injection.

\section*{Action to Take}
$\checkmark$ Give a sweet beverage if the casualty can drink.
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF and stay with the casualty.
$\checkmark$ Do not feed anything by mouth if the casualty turns unconscious.

\section*{2.6 - Stroke}

A stroke is a condition in which the blood supply to the brain is suddenly impaired by a blood clot or a ruptured blood vessel.

\section*{Recognition}
- Altered level of consciousness
- Slurred or garbled speech
- Loss of movement and sensation, usually on one side of the body
- Severe headache
- Identify signs of Stroke with the acronym "FAST":
- Facial weakness - Can the person smile? Is his/her eye or mouth drooping? Does one side of the face droop?
- Arm weakness - Can the person raise both arms? Does one arm drift downwards?
- Speech difficulty - Can the person speak clearly and understand what you say? Does the speech sound slurred or strange?
- Time to act fast - Call 995 for SCDF.

\section*{Actions to take}
$\checkmark$ Perform the Primary Survey. If casualty is unresponsive and not breathing, start chest compressions and apply an AED (see Chapter 8).
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ If the casualty is breathing normally on his/her own, place in the recovery position to keep the airway clear. However, do not turn or move the casualty if neck or spinal injury is suspected.
$\checkmark$ Reassure the casualty. He/she may be able to understand you even if they are unable to communicate.
$\checkmark$ Support the casualty's head and shoulders if he/she is conscious.
$\checkmark$ Monitor and record vital signs and level of consciousness regularly.

\section*{2.7 - The Recovery Position}

The recovery position is used in the management of a casualty who is unresponsive but is breathing normally.

When an unresponsive casualty is lying supine (facing up) and breathing normally, his/her airway may be obstructed by the tongue, mucus and/or vomit.

These problems may be prevented when the casualty is placed in the recovery position. This position keeps the airway open as fluid can drain easily from the mouth.

If there is no evidence of trauma, place the casualty on his/her side in the recovery position. The recovery position keeps the airway open. The following steps are recommended:

\section*{Step 1: Position the casualty}

\begin{figure}

- Tuck the hand nearer to you, arm straight and palm upward under the casualty's hip (see figure 15).
- Bring the other arm (further from you) across the casualty's chest and place the back of his/her hand against his/her cheek (see figure 16).
- Put your palm against the casualty's palm that is on the cheek and maintain this position.
- Using your other hand, bend the casualty's far knee to a 90-degree angle, hold the casualty's far hip and roll him/her towards you (see figure 17).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-034.jpg?height=509&width=1306&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=376}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 17 - Bend the casualty's far knee to a 90-degree angle}
\end{figure}

\section*{Step 2: Roll the casualty towards the rescuer}
- Use your knees/thighs to support the casualty's body as you turn him/her towards you to prevent him/her from rolling too far forward (see figure 18).

\section*{The Respiratory System}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-036.jpg?height=1080&width=1215&top_left_y=371&top_left_x=422}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 20 - The structure of the respiratory system}
\end{figure}

\section*{Structure}

The respiratory system comprises of:
- Nasal cavity
- Pharynx
- Larynx
- Trachea
- Lungs
- Bronchi
- Bronchioles
- Alveoli
- Diaphragm

\section*{Function}

The functions of the respiratory system are:
- To provide oxygen for use in the body
- To excrete carbon dioxide

Respiration involved the process of breathing and the exchange of gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs, and in cells throughout the body.

We breathe in air in order to take oxygen into the lungs and breathe out to expel the waste gas carbon dioxide, a by-product of respiration. When we breathe, air is drawn in through the nose and mouth into the airway and the lungs.

In the lungs, oxygen is taken from air sacs (alveoli) into blood vessels (pulmonary [lung] capillaries). At the same time, carbon dioxide is released from the capillaries into the alveoli and expelled as we breathe out (see figure 21).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-037.jpg?height=746&width=1117&top_left_y=1119&top_left_x=685}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 21 - Gas exchange process}
\end{figure}

\section*{Mechanism of Breathing}

During inspiration (breathing in) the chest cavity is enlarged. The lungs which are elastic, expand to fill up the increased space, and air is sucked in. Two main factors enlarge the chest cavity:
- Upward and outward movement of the ribs caused by the action of the inter-costal muscle.
- Flattening downward movement of the diaphragm.
- During expiration (breathing out) the lungs contract, the cavity returns to normal size and air is forced out.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-038.jpg?height=895&width=1606&top_left_y=388&top_left_x=228}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 22 - Mechanism of breathing}
\end{figure}

\section*{Requirements for Normal Breathing}

For breathing to proceed normally, the following are required:
- Oxygen, which is present in the air (about $21 \%$ ).
- The respiratory tract consists of:
- The airway, a passage leading from the nose to the lungs. This passage allows a free flow of air in and out of the lungs during respiration.
- Muscles of the chest wall and diaphragm, to draw air into the lungs.
- The respiratory centre in the brain and connective nerves to the respiratory muscles, to control and maintain autonomic regular breathing movements.
- The lungs, where oxygen is taken from the air into the blood, in exchange for carbon dioxide which is then breathed out.

Blood which carries oxygen absorbs from the lungs to the tissues throughout the body. The oxygen is carried and attached to the haemoglobin, a pigment in the red blood cells of the blood.

The heart pumps the blood and keeps it flowing to all parts of the body where oxygen is needed.

\section*{Breathing Rates for Normal Persons at Rest}

Adult: 12-16 breaths per min
Babies and young children: 20 - 30 breaths per min.

\section*{Respiratory Emergencies}

Respiratory emergencies occur when the casualty is having laboured breathing or breathing is in distress.

\section*{Recognition:}
- Difficulty in breathing and gasping for breath
- Use of accessory (neck) muscles to breathe
- Casualty appears anxious, restless and panicky
- Casualty cannot speak a few words between breaths
- Casualty's skin is bluish in colour (cyanosis)
- Confusion, disorientation leading to unconsciousness
- Breathing or heart may stop

\section*{Causes}

Common causes of respiratory problems are:
- Choking
- Fumes inhalation
- Drowning
- Hanging, Strangulation and Throttling
- Hyperventilation
- Bronchial Asthma/Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
- Heart Failure

\section*{Important Notes}
- Ensure the scene is safe to enter. In cases of poisoning by gases, fumes or lack of oxygen in and enclosed space, the casualty should be moved to a well-ventilated place.
- Reassure the casualty to allay his anxiety and panic.
- Find out from the casualty what happened to him to determine the cause for his breathing difficulty, if he is conscious.
- Perform the Primary Survey and commence CPR and use the AED if the casualty is not breathing.
- If the casualty does not respond, call 995 for SCDF.
- Check to see whether there are any obstructions in the mouth, e.g. foreign bodies, food, dentures, vomitus etc.
- If the casualty is unconscious but breathing normally, place him/her in the recovery position (see Chapter 2). However, do not turn or move the casualty if neck or spinal injury is suspected.
- Do not leave the casualty unattended at any time. Monitor the casualty and record the vital signs at regular intervals.

\section*{3.1 - Foreign Body Airway Obstruction}

Complete airway obstruction is an emergency that will result in death within minutes, if not treated immediately. A casualty can develop airway obstruction from either intrinsic (tongue and epiglottis) or extrinsic (foreign body) causes.

\section*{Causes}

\section*{Intrinsic Causes}
- The tongue can fall backward into the pharynx in an unconscious casualty in the supine position.
- Blood from head and facial injuries can flow into the airway.
- Regurgitated stomach contents can enter the airway.

\section*{Extrinsic Causes}

Foreign bodies, e.g. food, dentures etc.

\section*{Contributing Factors}
- Large, poorly chewed pieces of meat/food.
- Elevated blood alcohol levels.
- Dentures.
- Playing, crying, laughing and talking with food in the mouth.

\section*{Precautions}
- Cut food into small pieces. Chew slowly and thoroughly, especially if wearing dentures.
- Avoid excessive intake of alcohol.
- Avoid laughing and talking when the mouth is full.

\section*{Recognition}

Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) can be either partial or complete. Coughing is the body's natural defence against airway obstruction.

A casualty with partial (mild) airway obstruction will cough to expel the foreign body. If the casualty is wheezing (breathing noisily with a

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-042.jpg?height=490&width=558&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=1244}

\caption{Fig. 23 - The universal sign of choking}
\end{figure}
wheezing sound) or coughing, this means that the airway is partially obstructed. Do not interfere. Allow the casualty to cough to expel the object himself/herself.

In complete (severe) airway obstruction, the casualty is unable to speak, breathe or cough and may become cyanotic (blue). The casualty will clutch the neck with thumb and fingers, the universal distress signal for choking (see figure 23) that requires immediate action (see figure 24).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-042.jpg?height=1275&width=934&top_left_y=1290&top_left_x=611}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 24 - Summary of adult FBAO relief}
\end{figure}

\section*{Actions to Take}

Techniques used to relieve FBAO include the Heimlich Manoeuvre (abdominal thrusts) and chest thrusts for pregnant and obese casualties.
The Heimlich Maneuver, also known as the sub-diaphragmatic abdominal thrusts or abdominal thrusts is recommended for the relief of FBAO in responsive adults (more than 8 years of age) and children (1 to 8 years of age). The Heimlich Maneuver elevates the diaphragm and increase airway pressure, which forces air out from the lungs. This creates an artificial cough which can expel the foreign body from the airway.
In obese or pregnant casualties, chest thrusts should be used instead of abdominal thrusts.

\section*{Abdominal Thrust}
$\checkmark$ Ask if the casualty is choking. A choking casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.
$\checkmark$ If the casualty can cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough, perform the Heimlich Maneuver.
$\checkmark$ If the casualty is standing, the First Aider should stand behind the casualty. If the casualty is seated, the First Aider should be kneeling behind the seated casualty. Wrap the arms around the casualty's abdomen.
$\checkmark$ Locate the navel and place 2 fingers above the navel and well below the tip of xiphoid process.
$\checkmark$ Make a fist with the other hand with the thumb in the palm (see figure 25).

\section*{Chest Thrusts}

This technique is used as an alternative for obese or pregnant casualties.
$\checkmark$ Ask If the casualty is choking, the casualty will not be able to speak, breathe or cough but may nod his/her head. Tell the casualty that you can help.
$\checkmark$ If the casualty can cough, instruct the casualty to cough as hard as possible. If casualty is unable to cough, perform the Chest Thrust.
$\checkmark$ If the casualty is standing, the First Aider should stand behind the casualty. If the casualty is seated, the First Aider should be kneeling behind the seated casualty. Wrap the arms around the casualty's abdomen.
$\checkmark$ Place your arms under the casualty's armpits encircling the chest.
$\checkmark$ Make a fist with one hand with the thumb in the palm (see figure 27).
$\checkmark$ Place thumb-side of fist on the middle of the casualty's sternum (breastbone).

casualty becomes unconscious.

\section*{Unconscious Choking Casualty}

If the casualty becomes unconscious, proceed with the following steps:
$\checkmark$ Support and position the casualty lying on his/her back on a firm flat surface.
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF and get an AED if visible and nearby.
$\checkmark$ Locate the landmark and perform 30 chest compressions using the same location (see figure 29) and techniques as Cardio Pulmonary

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
Resuscitation (see Chapter 8).
$\checkmark$ After 30 chest compressions, check the mouth and remove any foreign body if seen.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT perform blind finger sweep as it may push the object back or further into the airway.
$\checkmark$ Continue with 30 chest compressions and check the mouth after every 30 chest compressions until help arrives and takes over or the casualty starts breathing, coughing, talking or moving.

\section*{3.2 - Asthma}

Asthma is a condition where there is difficulty in breathing due to the muscles of the air passages (bronchi and bronchioles) going into spasm (see figure 30).

Sometimes there is a recognized trigger for an asthmatic attack, such as an allergy, cold weather, a particular drug, dust or pollen. At other times, no obvious trigger can be identified.

Asthmatics can usually deal with their own attacks. They carry inhalers that they use regularly to prevent attacks. The drugs in the inhalers dilate the air passages, easing the difficulty in breathing.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-046.jpg?height=794&width=1600&top_left_y=1005&top_left_x=234}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 30 - Changes in the Bronchioles during an asthma attack}
\end{figure}

\section*{Causes}
- Environmental triggers like cold air, pollen, cigarette smoke and perfumes.
- Occupational exposures such as dust, fumes and industrial smoke.

\section*{Recognition}
- Difficulty in breathing.
- Wheezing during expiration.
- Blueness of the skin (cyanosis).
- Distress and anxiety.
- In severe attacks, the effort of breathing will tire out the casualty.

\section*{Actions to Take}
$\checkmark$ Place the casualty in a position that he/she finds most comfortable, which is often sitting down. Do not lay the casualty down.
$\checkmark$ Ask him/her to breathe slowly and deeply.
$\checkmark$ Ensure a good supply of fresh air - open windows etc.
$\checkmark$ Ask casualty about any asthma medication and assist to use the Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI). Some casualties may require a spacer (see figure 31) to administer the medication.
$\checkmark$ If the casualty has an Asthma Action Plan, follow the plan closely (see figure 32).
$\checkmark$ If the attack is prolonged or

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-047.jpg?height=566&width=810&top_left_y=959&top_left_x=1027}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 31 - Metered Dose Inhaler with Spacer}
\end{figure}
does not respond to medication, or severe respiratory distress occurs, call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ Commence chest compressions and use the AED if the casualty is not breathing.

\section*{Direct MDI use}
$\checkmark$ Remove the cap from the MDI and shake well.
$\checkmark$ The casualty should seal their mouth over the MDI's mouthpiece.
$\checkmark$ Casualty should inhale and exhale deeply before use. Each puff should be coordinated with a deep breath and held for about 10 seconds.

\section*{MDI with Spacer}
$\checkmark$ Insert the MDI into the spacer before the casualty should seal their mouth over the spacer's mouthpiece (a face mask may be required for children under 6 years of age).
$\checkmark$ Each puff into the spacer should be followed by normal 6 breaths through the spacer.
$\checkmark$ If more than 1 puff is needed (as prescribed by their doctor - not more than 8 sprays), rest for 1 minute before commencing the above steps until the required number of puffs have been completed.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\section*{3.3 - Hyperventilation}

Hyperventilation is a condition of over-breathing. This is commonly seen in cases of acute anxiety and may accompany hysteria or a panic attack. It may also be seen in a casualty who has received an emotional shock.

Over-breathing causes and excessive loss of carbon dioxide from the blood, leading to a tingling sensation and numbness of the hands and legs. As breathing returns to normal, the casualty gradually recovers.

\section*{Causes}
- Anxiety
- Hysteria
- Panic attack
- Fright

\section*{Recognition}
- Unnaturally fast, deep breathing
- Dizziness, faintness, trembling or marked tingling in the hands
- Cramps in the hands and feet

\section*{Actions to take}
$\checkmark$ Reassure the casualty.
$\checkmark$ Lead the casualty to a quiet place, where he/she may be better able to regain control of his/her breathing.
$\checkmark$ Advise casualty to see a doctor.

\section*{3.4 - Fumes Inhalation}

Fumes or smoke that have accumulated in a confined space can quickly overcome anyone who is not wearing protective equipment. A burning building presents not only the fire itself, but also falling structures as well as dangers from fumes and smoke.

Any person who has been enclosed in a confined space during a fire should be assumed to have inhaled smoke. Smoke from burning plastics, foam padding and synthetic wall coverings will probably contain poisonous fumes. Casualties should also be examined for other injuries sustained as a result of the fire.

\section*{Recognition}

\section*{Fumes Inhalation:}
- Difficulty in breathing from spasm and swelling of the air passages.
- Burns in or around the nose or mouth.
- Unconsciousness.
- The heart may stop.

\section*{Carbon Monoxide Inhalation:}

This highly dangerous gas prevents the blood from carrying oxygen. It is tasteless and odourless. A large amount of carbon monoxide in the air, such as in a confined space, can kill a person very quickly. Lengthy exposure to a slow leak from a faulty gas heater may also cause severe, possibly fatal poisoning.
- Difficulty in breathing
- Headache/Dizziness
- Nausea and vomiting
- Confusion
- Unconsciousness
- May lead to respiratory and cardiac arrest

\section*{Actions to Take}
$\checkmark$ DO NOT enter a gas or smoke-filled room without proper safety equipment. Look after yourself and do not end up being a casualty.
$\checkmark$ Call for help. Call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ If you are sure that it is safe to do so, remove

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 33 - Remove casualty to safety}
\end{figure}
the casualty from danger.
$\checkmark$ Perform the Primary Survey and commence CPR and use the AED if the casualty is not breathing.
$\checkmark$ If the casualty is unconscious but breathing normally, place him/her in the recovery position (see Chapter 2). However, do not turn or move the casualty if neck or spinal injury is suspected - based on the how the injury was sustained, and the force or height involved.
$\checkmark$ Treat other injuries e.g. burns, open wounds, etc.
$\checkmark$ Do not leave the casualty unattended at any time. Monitor the casualty and record the vital signs at regular intervals.

\section*{3.5 - Allergic Reaction}

Allergies are an overreaction of the body's natural defence system that helps fight infections (immune system). The immune system normally protects the body from viruses and bacteria by producing antibodies to fight them. In an allergic reaction, the immune system starts fighting substances that are usually harmless (such as dust mites, pollen, or a medicine) as though these substances were trying to attack the body.

An allergic reaction may not occur during the first exposure to an allergyproducing substance (allergen). For example, the first time you are stung by a bee, you may have only pain and redness from the sting. If you are stung again, you may have hives or trouble breathing. This is caused by the response of the immune system.

Many people will have some problem with allergies or allergic reactions at some point in their lives. Allergic reactions can range from mild and annoying to sudden and life-threatening.

Anaphylactic shock is failure of the circulation due to a severe allergic reaction within the body in response to something either taken by mouth, or comes into contact with the body, or was injected.

\section*{Recognition}

\section*{Mild to Moderate Allergic Reaction}
- Widespread or localised (over one area only) red, blotchy skin rashes
- Swelling of the face and neck
- Puffiness around the eyes

\section*{Life-threatening Allergic Reaction (Anaphylaxis)}
- Impaired breathing, ranging from a tight chest to severe difficulty; the casualty may wheeze and gasp for air.
- Persistent cough, hoarse voice, difficulty in swallowing or swollen tongue.
- Pale or dizziness/sleepy, may become unconscious.

\section*{Action to Take}
$\checkmark$ Place a conscious casualty in a sitting position to relieve any breathing difficulty.
$\checkmark$ In mild to moderate cases, advise the casualty to seek treatment at a clinic. If unsure or in severe cases, call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ Ask if the casualty is carrying their prescribed medication (eg. Antihistamines or Epinephrine auto injector) to treat their known allergic reaction.
$\checkmark$ If the casualty indicates the need to use an auto injector, ask whether you should help inject the medication. This is usually done by pressing the auto injector against the person's thigh (see figure 34) for 3 to 10 seconds and massaging the area for 10 seconds (or follow the specific instructions indicated on the auto-injector).
$\checkmark$ Loosen tight clothing and cover the person with a blanket. Do not give the casualty anything to drink.
$\checkmark$ If there's vomiting or bleeding from the mouth, turn the casualty to the side to prevent choking.
$\checkmark$ Commence chest compressions and use the AED if the casualty is unconscious and not breathing.
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF even if symptoms start to improve as it is possible for symptoms to recur. Monitoring in a hospital is usually necessary.

\section*{The Circulatory System}

The circulatory system is made up of the heart and blood vessels (see figure 35).

Four to six litres of blood circulate around the body to distribute oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and carry waste products away.

\section*{Blood Vessels}

There are three types of blood vessels: arteries, veins and capillaries.

Arteries - Strong, muscular, elastic-walled

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-055.jpg?height=741&width=692&top_left_y=456&top_left_x=1127}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 35 - The circulatory system}
\end{figure}
vessels which carry blood away from the heart towards the tissues.

Veins - Thin-walled vessels which carry blood back to the heart. Blood is squeezed through the veins by action of the surrounding muscles and is kept flowing towards the heart through one-way valves.

Capillaries - Arteries subdivide to form a dense network of fine, thin-walled vessels called capillaries within the body tissues. The thin capillary walls allow for the exchange of gases and other materials between cells of the body and the blood. The capillaries then rejoin to become veins.

\section*{Blood Pressure}

The force with which the heart pumps blood through the vessels and around the body is known as "blood pressure".
- Systolic pressure in adults $=100-140 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$
- Diastolic pressure in adults $=60-90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$

\section*{The Pulse}

This is the pressure wave along arteries, generated by the contraction of the heart. It can be felt where the artery is close to the surface of the body. The
pulse rate may increase with exertion, fear, fever, blood loss and certain illness. On the other hand, fainting, severe head injuries and heart disorders may slow it down.

\section*{Where the pulse may be felt}

The pulse can be felt at the wrist (radial pulse). It can also be felt at the neck (carotid pulse) (see figure 36).

\section*{Pulse rate for a normal person at rest}
- Adult = 60-80 beats per min
- Child = 80- 120 beats per min
- Infant = $100-160$ beats per min

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-056.jpg?height=724&width=578&top_left_y=513&top_left_x=1304}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 36 - Sites to check pulse rate}
\end{figure}

\section*{Abnormal pulse}

\section*{Rate}
- Tachycardia $>100 / \mathrm{min}$ - fast heart rate
- Bradycardia $<60 / \mathrm{min}$ - slow heart rate.

\section*{Rhythm}
- Irregular heartbeat or abnormal beats in heart disease

\section*{Strength}
- Weak e.g. in shock or low pressure.

\section*{4.1 - Shock}

Shock is defined as a life-threatening condition which may be progressive and may lead to the collapse of the circulatory system.

\section*{Recognition}

\section*{Types of Shock}

\section*{Hypovolemic Shock}

Hypovolemic shock is failure of the circulation due to more than 20 percent (one-fifth) of the body's blood or fluid supply being lost either internally or externally. This severe fluid loss makes it difficult for the heart to pump enough blood to the rest of the body. The signs and symptoms vary with the degree of severity of shock.

\section*{Cardiogenic Shock}

Cardiogenic shock is failure of circulation due to a heart attack or any condition that damages the heart muscle.

\section*{Septic Shock (A form of distributive shock)}

Septic shock is a potentially fatal medical condition that occurs when organ injury or damage in response to infection, leads to dangerously low blood pressure and abnormalities in cellular metabolism.

\section*{Anaphylactic Shock (A form of distributive shock)}

Anaphylactic shock is failure of the circulation due to a severe allergic reaction within the body in response to something either taken by mouth, or comes into contact with the body, or was injected. Visible signs include widespread or localised (over one area only) red, blotchy skin rashes, swelling of the face and neck, puffiness around the eyes as well as Impaired breathing, ranging from a tight chest to severe difficulty; the casualty may wheeze and gasp for air.

\section*{Neurogenic Shock (A form of distributive shock)}

Neurogenic shock results in low blood pressure, occasionally with a slowed heart rate, due to the disruption of the autonomic pathways within the spinal cord. It can occur after damage to the central nervous system, such as spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury. Low blood pressure occurs due to decreased systemic vascular resistance as a result of lacking sympathetic tone which in turn causes pools of blood staying within the extremities and not being redirected to the core body.

Fig. 38 - Types of external bleeding

\section*{Arterial Bleeding}

Arterial blood is bright red in colour and spurts from wounds in time with each heartbeat. Bleeding from a big artery can quickly lead to shock.

\section*{Venous Bleeding}

Venous blood is dark red. If flows steadily rather than spurts from a wound. Bleeding from a large vein can quickly lead to shock.

\section*{Capillary Bleeding}

If capillaries are cut, blood will ooze from the wound.

\section*{Internal bleeding}
- Bleeding in the lungs may result in blood streaked sputum being coughed out.
- Bleeding in the stomach or intestines may result in coffee ground vomitus, passing of black, tarry stools or even fresh blood.
- Bleeding in the urinary tract may result in passing of urine which is smoky in appearance.
- Pain, tenderness and rigidity of abdominal muscles.
- Signs and symptoms of shock may be present if bleeding is severe.

\section*{Actions to Take}

\section*{External Bleeding}
$\checkmark$ Apply direct pressure to the wound using a gloved hand and place a clean dressing over the wound as soon as possible (see figure 39).
$\checkmark$ Direct Pressure can help control minor to moderate bleeding.
$\checkmark$ Apply a bulky pad extending beyond the edges of the wound, and bandage firmly. If bleeding continues, leave the dressing in place and bandage another one on top (see figure 40).
$\checkmark$ Do not disturb the pads or bandages once bleeding is controlled.

\section*{4.3 - Wounds}

A wound is an injury to body tissues which can be closed or open.
- An open wound is a break in the skin
- A closed wound is a wound where the skin is intact. Blood escapes into the surrounding tissues.

\section*{4.4 - Bandaging}

\section*{Dressings}

Dressings are used to control bleeding, absorb any fluids from the wound and prevent infection of the wound.

Common dressings: Individually wrapped sterile adhesive dressing (also known as plasters) and absorbent gauze.

\section*{Individually wrapped sterile adhesive dressing (plaster):}
- These are adhesive strips plasters of various shapes and sizes used to cover small wounds.
- Ensure skin is dry before applying the plaster.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-068.jpg?height=438&width=438&top_left_y=536&top_left_x=1427}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 51 - Individually wrapped sterile adhesive dressing (plaster)}
\end{figure}

\section*{Absorbent Gauze:}
- Absorbent gauze are non-adhesive layers of weaved cotton which may be available in sterilised and non-sterilised versions.
- They can be used to stop bleeding when pressure is applied, allowing blood to clot on a bleeding wound or used as a light dressing to cover over a burn to prevent infection.
- Bandages or adhesive tape are used to secure the

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 52 - Absorbent gauze}
\end{figure}
dressings in place.

\section*{Bandages}

Bandages found in the First Aid kit are used to maintain direct pressure to control bleeding, to keep dressings in place, to prevent undesirable movement of an injured limb, to support an injured limb or joint and to limit swelling.

There are two types of bandages: Crepe and Triangular

\section*{Crepe Bandages:}
- They are made of cotton, gauze or linen materials.
- Available in varying lengths and width to suit different parts of the body.
- Elastic crepe bandages are preferred as they conform to the body part's contours and can provide even pressure over the injury.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-069.jpg?height=450&width=364&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=1490}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 53 - Crepe
bandage}
\end{figure}

\section*{Triangular Bandages:}
- Triangular Bandages are usually used as arm slings or to immobilise limbs.
- They may also be used as paddings between splints and the limb to provide more comfort.
- It can also be used as additional paddings to increase pressure to control severe bleeding.
- Triangular bandage can be improvised as a tourniquet when needed.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-069.jpg?height=529&width=483&top_left_y=828&top_left_x=1399}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 54 - Triangular
bandage}
\end{figure}

\section*{Important Notes:}

Pain, tingling and numbness are indications of a bandage that is too tight. If any of these symptoms appear, remove the bandage immediately and re-apply the bandage to the area less tightly. If bleeding is already controlled, the bandage need not be so tight since its main purpose is to hold the dressing in place.

Different Folds of a Triangular Bandage

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 54 - Different folds of a triangular bandage}
\end{figure}

\section*{Tying a Reef Knot}

A Reef Knot (see figure 55), or also known as a Square Knot, is widely practiced in First Aid training courses as a simple way to secure the ends of bandages while ensuring a comfortable flat knot when resting on the body.

An additional advantage of this knot is the ability to be quickly undone, allowing adjustments to be made.

However, it should be noted that a Reef Knot is not the only knot that must be used. In an emergency, the ability to apply a secure knot to provide suitable support for the various slings and immobilisation should be the focus.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-071.jpg?height=815&width=1266&top_left_y=1007&top_left_x=439}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 55 - Steps in tying a Reef Knot}
\end{figure}

\section*{Making a Ring Pad}

A ring pad (see figure 56) is an ideal padding when immobilising embedded/impaled object. Sizing of the embedded/impaled object must be done before

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-071.jpg?height=393&width=962&top_left_y=2132&top_left_x=821}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 56 - Making a Ring Pad}
\end{figure}
creation of the ring pad.

Despite the advantages of the ring pad, the first aider will need to consider the time required to create a ring pad for the embedded object. Alternatively, improvisation can come in the form of pads from folded triangular bandages or folded gauze.

\section*{Applying a Crepe Bandage}

Application of a crepe bandage is a relatively simple process (see figure 57). This is usually done to secure dressings in place and should be done in a manner that does not restrict blood flow. It is ideal to ensure bleeding has been controlled with direct pressure before application of the crepe bandage.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-072.jpg?height=763&width=1631&top_left_y=1096&top_left_x=234}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 57 - Applying a Crepe Bandage}
\end{figure}

The above method can be used on straight limbs such as arms and legs. However, if a crepe bandage is required at the joints such as the elbow, palm/wrist, knee or ankle/foot, it can be applied as shown below (see figure 58).

\begin{figure}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}

\end{figure}

\section*{Applying a Large Arm Sling}

A large arm sling (see figure 59) is supposed to provide comfort, immobilisation or support to an injured arm. Do note that the palm should not be dangling out of the sling and should not be lower than the elbow level. Common uses for a large arm sling may include:
$\checkmark$ Fracture of lower or upper arm

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-073.jpg?height=1201&width=1240&top_left_y=793&top_left_x=482}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 59 - Applying a Large Arm Sling}
\end{figure}

\section*{Applying an Elevation Sling}

Due to the angulation of this sling, it would be useful when some form of elevation is required at the lower arm, wrist or palm to reduce swelling or to control blood flow to those areas. Common uses include:
$\checkmark$ Fracture or dislocation of the shoulder or collarbone
$\checkmark$ Bleeding wounds to the lower arm, wrist or palm

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
$\checkmark$ Fracture of the ribs

\section*{Bandaging the Scalp}

Bleeding from a scalp wound can be profuse and may appear to be more serious than it is.
$\checkmark$ Control bleeding by applying direct pressure (see figure 61).
$\checkmark$ Apply pressure around edges of the wound with a ring pad (see figure 56 on page 66) if a skull fracture is suspected.
$\checkmark$ Secure the dressing with a triangular bandage (see figure 62). Tie the knot at the forehead, just above the eyebrows (see figure 63).
$\checkmark$ Lay the casualty down with the head and shoulders raised to control bleeding.
$\checkmark$ Monitor and record the vital signs every 5 minutes.

\begin{figure}

\section*{Applying a Hand Bandage}

For minor cuts, burns or abrasions to the hand, a hand bandage (see figure 65) can be applied over the initial dressing using an open triangular bandage.

Alternatively, a crepe bandage may be applied over the initial dressing.

It can be supported with an elevation sling (see figure 60 on page 69).

\begin{figure}

\section*{Applying a Tourniquet}

Tourniquets are an effective means of arresting life-threatening external haemorrhage from limb injury. It is recommended to use tourniquets for the following situations:
$\checkmark$ Severe external limb bleeding that could not be controlled by direct pressure
$\checkmark$ Multiple casualties with extremity haemorrhage and lack of resources to maintain simple methods of haemorrhage control
$\checkmark$ Extreme life-threatening limb haemorrhage, or limb amputation/mangled limb with multiple bleeding points

\section*{Important notes when applying a tourniquet:}
$\checkmark$ The version of tourniquet below is an improvised type (see figure 68).
$\checkmark$ Direct pressure must still be applied on the wound when applying a tourniquet (see step 1 of figure 68).
$\checkmark$ Use a broad-fold triangular bandage from the First Aid kit. Other suitable materials such as a belt, scarf or strips of clothes may also be used.
$\checkmark$ When applying the tourniquet, place it about 5 cm from the bleeding site (see step 2 of figure 68) and rotate the stick (see step 3 of figure 68) until the bleeding it completely stopped.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT apply over a joint as it will be ineffective.
$\checkmark$ Secure the stick such that it does not undo the tightening effect (see step 4 of figure 68).
$\checkmark$ Once applied, the tourniquet can be left in place for up to 2 hours.
$\checkmark$ Record the time of the application and inform the SCDF officer taking over the casualty.
$\checkmark$ If the First Aid kit within your premise

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 69 - The Musculoskeletal System}
\end{figure}

The musculoskeletal system (see figure 69) provides structure, support, stability, and movement to the body. It comprises of the bones of the skeleton, muscles, tendons, cartilage, ligaments, joints, and other connective tissue that supports and binds tissues and organs together.

Infants are born with about 300 bones, almost a third of which eventually fuse to form the adult skeleton with 206 bones.
- The skull, spine and ribcage protect the vital body organs
- The pelvis supports the abdominal organs
- The bones and joints of the arms and legs enable the body to move

\section*{5.1 - Fracture and Dislocation}

Fractures are breaks or disruptions in bone tissue. These can be complete or partial breaks in the bone.

Dislocation is the displacement of a bone at a joint, caused by a strong force wrenching the bone out of its joint, or by a violent muscle contraction. There may be associated tearing of the ligaments. The joints most commonly dislocated are the shoulder, fingers and jaw.

In many cases, it can be difficult to distinguish a dislocation from a closed fracture. If in any doubt, treat the injury as a fracture. A severe dislocation of any joint may also fracture the bones involved.

\section*{Types of Fracture}
- Closed fracture - a bone is broken but the skin is intact. Bruising and swelling often occur around the fracture side.
- Open fracture - a wound accompanies the fracture and the overlying skin is broken. The bone may be exposed through the wound.
- Complicated fracture - a fracture is complicated by injury to adjoining muscles, blood vessels, nerves and organs. E.g. a fractured rib damaging the lung causing bleeding.

\section*{Causes}

Direct force - a bone may break at a point where a heavy blow is received (see figure 70). For example, the forearm bone may be broken by the impact of a piece of wood falling on it.

Indirect force - a force my travel from the point of impact through the body to break bones elsewhere (see figure 70). A common example is falling on an outstretched hand which in an adult, results in a fracture of the collar bone; a fracture of the wrist in the elderly; and an elbow fracture in a child.

\end{figure}

\section*{Actions to Take}

\section*{Open Fracture:}
$\checkmark$ Cover the wound with a clean pad and apply pressure around it to control bleeding with a bandage.
$\checkmark$ Move the uninjured part of the body and secure to the injured part of the body.
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ Check the circulation beyond the bandaging every 10 minutes.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT press down directly on a protruding bone. Use ring pads around the protruding bone to hold it in place.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT move the casualty until the injured part is secured and supported.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT let the casualty eat or drink anything.

\section*{Closed Fracture:}
$\checkmark$ Lay the casualty down and minimize movement.
$\checkmark$ Support the injured part until it is immobilized.
$\checkmark$ Move the uninjured part of the body and secure to the injured part of the body.
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ Check the circulation beyond the bandaging every 10 minutes.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT let the casualty eat or drink anything.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT move the casualty until the injured part is secured and supported.

\section*{Dislocation:}
$\checkmark$ Support the injured part until it is immobilized.
$\checkmark$ Secure the injured part to an uninjured part of the body.
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ Elevate the injured limb if possible.
$\checkmark$ Check the circulation beyond the bandaging every 10 minutes
$\checkmark$ DO NOT let the casualty eat or drink anything.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT move the casualty until the injured part is secured and supported.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT force the dislocated joint back into its "original" position.

\section*{Use of Splints}

A splint is a device used for support or immobilization of a limb or the spine and can be made from many different materials. Splinting of the injured part should be applied in the position it was found without straightening or causing more pain/discomfort.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-083.jpg?height=346&width=490&top_left_y=2244&top_left_x=1307}

\end{figure}

Some examples of splints are:
- Improvised splint: folded newspaper, magazines, cardboard, or wooden sticks
- Commercial splint: SAM splint (mouldable splint) (see figure 73 on page 78), air splint
- Body splint: the injured part is tied to an uninjured body part (e.g. an injured finger to an adjacent finger; an injured arm tied to the chest).

\caption{Fig. 74 - Skull Fracture}
\end{figure}

A skull fracture is any break in the cranial bone, also known as the skull (see chapter 2). There are many types of skull fractures, but only one major cause: an impact or a blow to the head that's strong enough to break the bone. An injury to the brain can also accompany the fracture, but that may not always be the case.

\section*{Recognition}
- A wound or bruise on the head.
- Progressive deterioration in the level of consciousness.
- Clear fluid (cerebro-spinal fluid) or watery blood coming out from the nose or ear.
- Bleeding into the whites of the eyes.

\section*{Actions to Take}
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ Immobilise the head \& neck.
$\checkmark$ Perform CPR if casualty is not breathing.
$\checkmark$ Casualty may not be fully conscious, do not feed the casualty anything.
$\checkmark$ If there is discharge (blood or fluid) from the ear or nose, position the casualty such that the affected ear or nose is lower than the unaffected one.
$\checkmark$ Monitor and record vital signs and level of consciousness regularly.
$\checkmark$ Stay with the casualty.

\section*{Jaw Fracture/Dislocation}

A broken jaw is a break (fracture) in the jaw bone. A dislocated jaw means the lower part of the jaw has moved out of its normal position at one or both joints where the jaw bone connects to the skull (temporomandibular joints).

\section*{Recognition}
- Pain when moving the jaw and swallowing
- Distortion of the teeth and dribbling
- Swelling, tenderness and bruising
- A wound or bruising within the mouth

\section*{Actions to Take}
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ Sit the casualty up with his/her head well forward, to allow any fluid to drain away.
$\checkmark$ Ask the casualty to hold a soft pad firmly in place to support the jaw.

\section*{Collar Bone Fracture}

The collar bone (clavicle) forms a strut between the breastbone and the shoulder blade, giving support to the arm. It is usually broken by indirect force, transmitted from a fall onto the outstretched hand.

\section*{Recognition}
- The casualty supports the arm and inclines the head to the injured side
- Inability to raise the arm
- Sharp pain and deformity at the injury site
- Casualty's head may be tilted towards the injured side to minimise movement

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 75 - Collar Bone Fracture}
\end{figure}

\section*{Action to Take}
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ Ask the casualty to sit down and gently place the affected arm across the chest at a comfortable angle.
$\checkmark$ Apply an elevation sling to the affected arm (see figure 60 on page 69).
$\checkmark$ Insert soft padding between the arm and the chest on the affected side if needed.
$\checkmark$ A broad bandage can be applied across the arm and chest to stabilise the injury (see figure 84 on page 93).

\section*{Shoulder Dislocation}

A fall onto the shoulder or a wrenching force may cause the head of the arm bone (humerus) to come out of the shoulder joint socket. This form of dislocation caused acute pain and any movement of the shoulder would be intolerable.

\section*{Recognition}

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 76 - Shoulder Dislocation}
\end{figure}
- Pain, swelling and loss of rounded contour of the shoulder
- The casualty supports the arm and inclines the head to the injured side
- Inability to raise the arm

\section*{Actions to take}
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT attempt to replace the bone into its socket.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT allow the casualty to eat or drink.
$\checkmark$ Ask the casualty to sit down and gently place the affected arm across the chest at a comfortable angle.
$\checkmark$ Apply an elevation sling or large arm sling to the affected arm (see figure 60 on page 69 and figure 59 on page 68 respectively).
$\checkmark$ Insert soft padding between the arm and the chest on the affected side.
$\checkmark$ A broad bandage can be applied across the arm and chest to stabilise the injury (see figure 85 and 86 on page 94).

\section*{Rib Fracture}

Rib fractures may be caused by a direct or indirect force. If the fracture is complicated by a penetrating wound or a fracture at two or more locations of the ribcage (also known as flail chest), breathing may be severely impaired.

\section*{Recognition}
- Pain at the fracture site
- Pain on taking deep breaths or coughing
- Shallow breathing
- An open wound over the fracture through which you might hear air being "sucked" into the chest cavity
- Presence of shock in the casualty

\begin{figure}

$\checkmark$ Tie a broad bandage across the sling (see figure 85 on page 94).
$\checkmark$ If the casualty is unconscious with no suspected spinal injury, place him/her in the recovery position with the injured side down. This allows the lung on the uninjured side to work at its full capacity while immobilising the injured side.

\section*{Upper Arm Fracture}

The long bone of the upper arm (humerus) may be fractured across its shaft by a direct blow, but it is more common for the neck of the humerus at the shoulder to break following a fall.

\section*{Recognition}
- Pain and tenderness at the fracture site
- Swelling and bruising
- Difficulty in raising the arm

\section*{Actions to Take}
$\checkmark$ Sit the casualty down. Place the injured arm across his/her chest in a position that is most comfortable. Get him/her to support the arm if possible.

\section*{Actions to Take}

For an elbow that can be bent:
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ Treat as for a fracture of the upper arm (see page 84).

For an elbow that cannot be bent:
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT attempt to forcibly bend or straighten the elbow.
$\checkmark$ Lay the casualty down and place the injured limb on the trunk.
$\checkmark$ Place soft padding between the injured limb and the body to ensure that bandaging will not displace the broken bones.
$\checkmark$ Bandage the injured limb to the trunk, first at the wrist and hips, then above the elbow (see figure 87 on page 95).

\section*{Forearm and Wrist Fracture}

The bones of the forearm (the radius and ulna) may be fractured across their shafts by a violent blow.

In the elderly, the bones at the wrist may be broken in a fall. This is called the Colles' fracture.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 83 - Strain, Sprain and Contusion}
\end{figure}

\section*{Strain}

A strain is the result of overstretching a muscle resulting in a partial tear e.g. in the calf muscle.

\section*{Muscle Contusion}

Muscle contusion (bruise) result from a blow to the muscles.

\section*{Muscle Cramp}

Overuse of a muscle, dehydration, muscle strain or simply holding a position for a prolonged period can cause a muscle cramp.

\section*{Sprain}

A sprain is the partial or complete stretching or tearing of the ligaments connected with a joint. The ankle is the most commonly sprained joint.

\section*{Recognition}

\section*{Strain}
- A sudden sharp or severe pain
- Tenderness when the area is touched

\section*{Muscle Contusion}
- Swelling of the affected muscle
- Pain and tenderness
- A bruise may appear

\section*{Muscle Cramp}
- Pain and uncontrollable spasm
- Restricted movement

\section*{Sprain}
- Acute pain and tenderness at the joint
- Swelling around the joint
- Limited movement

\section*{Actions to take}

\section*{Strain and Muscle Contusion}
$\checkmark$ Apply the RICE treatment (see below).

\section*{Muscle Cramp}
$\checkmark$ Get the casualty to gently stretch the affected muscles; or
$\checkmark$ Relax the muscles by applying steady pressure to them.

\section*{Sprain}
$\checkmark$ Remove the footwear gently to check and treat the injury.
$\checkmark$ Apply the RICE procedure (see below).
$\checkmark$ If a fracture cannot be excluded, immobilize the joint and call 995 for SCDF.

\section*{RICE Treatment}

The acronym RICE is used for contusions (bruises), strains, sprains, dislocations and fractures (see figure 84 on page 93).

\section*{R- Rest:}
$\checkmark$ Rest, steady and support the injured part in the most comfortable position for the casualty.

\section*{I-Ice:}
$\checkmark$ Using cold compress will reduce swelling, bruising and pain.
$\checkmark$ Apply a cold compress for 10-15 minutes or stop when the casualty starts to shiver or feels numb at the site.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT apply a cold compress longer than 20 minutes at a time as frostbite and/or nerve damage can result.

\section*{C-Compression:}
$\checkmark$ Apply gentle, even pressure to the injured part by surrounding the area with a thick layer of soft padding, such as cotton wool or plastic foam, and secure with a crepe bandage.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT apply the bandage too tightly as this would restrict circulation. Expose the fingers and toes to observe for possible colour change.

\section*{E - Elevation:}
$\checkmark$ Raise and support the injured limb to reduce swelling.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT elevate a suspected fracture until it has been stabilized with a splint. Note that some fractures should not be elevated e.g. a spinal fracture.

\section*{5.3 - Immobilisation/Bandaging}

\section*{Immobilisation}

Immobilisation requires movement of the injured part to be minimised in order to reduce pain and prevent further injury. This can be done with the use of splints (see page 78) along with bandaging techniques covered in chapter 4.

Immobilisation should consider the casualty's level of comfort (and cooperation). Straightening of the angulated fracture should not be performed by the First Aider and should be referred to professionals with specific training.

\section*{Immobilisation of the Upper Body}

Apply an elevation sling with a broad-fold bandage across the sling and chest (see figure 85):
$\checkmark$ Dislocated shoulder
$\checkmark$ Fractured collar bone
$\checkmark$ Fracture of the ribs (soft padding to be placed between chest and arm)

\caption{Fig. 87 - Immobilisation for elbow fracture that cannot be bent}
\end{figure}

\section*{Immobilisation of the Lower Body}

When immobilising parts of the lower body, it is important to start with the feet or ankles as they are the most distant point from the torso and any movement will cause pain or discomfort. This should include splinting of the lower limb with available splints or using the uninjured side as a splint.

The following picture shows a figure-of-eight bandage (see figure 88) used to secure the feet to prevent outward rotation of the legs, leading to further aggravation of the leg or pelvic fracture. Other alternatives include tying the laces of both shoes together and using crepe or triangular bandage to secure the feet together. After the immobilizing the feet, other bandages can be applied to deal with the specific lower body fractures.

\begin{figure}

$\checkmark$ Triangular bandages can be prepared into broad of narrow folds and inserted under the natural spaces under the knees, ankles or the lower back.
$\checkmark$ Gently slide the folded bandages under the body into place to be tied.
$\checkmark$ Padding should be placed between both legs to provide some comfort.
$\checkmark$ Knots are usually tied on the uninjured side.

\section*{Immobilisation for Thigh (Femur) or Lower Leg (Tibia/Fibula) Fractures}

\section*{Function}
- Protects from injury
- Protects from infections
- Regulates body temperature

\section*{Important Notes}
- Establish own safety before attempting to treat the casualty.
- Stop the burning, by means of rapid cooling using water for 5-10 minutes, in order to prevent further damage to the tissues, to reduce swelling, minimize shock, and alleviate pain.
- Cover the injury to protect it from infection.
- Except in cases of very minor burns, obtain appropriate medical aid.

\section*{6.1 - Burns Depth and Severity of Burns}

Burns and scalds are damage to the skin usually caused by heat. Both are treated in the same way.

A burn is caused by dry heat - by an iron or fire, for example. A scald is caused by something wet, such as hot water or steam.

The amount of pain experienced by the casualty is not always related to the severity of the burn. Even a very serious burn may be relatively painless.

\section*{Recognition}

\section*{Burns Depth}

\section*{Superficial Burn ( $1^{\text {st }}$ Degree)}
- Injury involves only the outer layer of the skin
- Redness, swelling, tenderness and pain are present

\section*{Partial Thickness Burn (2 ${ }^{\text {nd }}$ Degree)}
- Injury affects the deeper layers of the epidermis
- Formation of blisters
- Pain is present

\section*{Full Thickness Burn ( $3{ }^{\text {rd }}$ Degree)}
- Injury involves all layers of the skin; damage may extend to nerve, muscle and fat
- The skin appears pale, waxy or charred

- Relatively pain free

\section*{Severity of Burns}

The extent of a burn is expressed in terms of a percentage of the Body Surface Area (BSA).

The "Rule-of-Nines", which divides the surface area of the body into areas of approximately $9 \%$, is used to calculate extent and to decide what level of medical attention should be sought.

The Palmar Method is used for estimating the percentage of body surface area on a casualty by using the casualty's palm to estimate 1\% of their Body Surface Area (BSA). This method may be useful in estimating burn areas smaller than a

\section*{For a normal adult:}
$\checkmark$ Any partial-thickness burn (2 ${ }^{\text {nd }}$ degree) of 1\% or more (covering an area approximating to that of the casualty's palm) must be seen by a doctor.
$\checkmark$ A partial-thickness burn ( $2^{\text {nd }}$ degree) of $9 \%$ or more may lead to shock; the casualty needs hospital treatment.
$\checkmark$ A full-thickness burn ( $3^{\text {rd }}$ degree) of any size requires immediate hospital treatment.

\section*{6.2 - Classification and Treatment of Burns}

\section*{Classification of Burns Injuries}
- Thermal burns - caused by hot surfaces and fires
- Scalding - caused by steam, hot liquids, hot oil
- Chemical burns - caused by acids and alkalis
- Electrical burns - caused by electricity and lightning strikes
- Radiation burns - caused by exposure to the sun or radioactive substances

\section*{Superficial Burn ( $1^{\text {st }}$ Degree) and Partial Thickness Burn ( $2^{\text {nd }}$ Degree)}
$\checkmark$ Remove jewellery, belts and other restrictive items, especially from burned areas around the neck as burned areas may swell rapidly.
$\checkmark$ Flush the burnt area with tap water for at least 10 minutes, blot dry and cover with a sterile dressing or any clean cloth.
$\checkmark$ Treat the casualty for shock if present.
$\checkmark$ Seek medical attention.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT break blisters.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT use adhesive dressings.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT apply ice.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT remove anything stuck to the burn as further damage and infection may result.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT use antiseptic preparation, ointment sprays, lotions or creams to the injury.

\section*{Full Thickness Burn ( $3{ }^{\text {rd }}$ Degree)}
$\checkmark$ Cover the area with a sterile dressing or any clean cloth.
$\checkmark$ Treat the casualty for shock if present.
$\checkmark$ Watch for breathing difficulty involving burns on the face and neck.
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT apply ice.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT remove anything stuck to the burn as further damage and infection may result.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT immerse large burnt areas into water as it can cause loss of body heat.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT use antiseptic preparation, ointment sprays, lotions or creams to the injury.

\section*{Burns in Special Areas}

Burns to the face and within the mouth or throat by inhalation or heated fumes are extremely dangerous as they cause rapid swelling and inflammation of the air passages. Signs of burning will usually be evident. There may also be hoarseness of voice in the casualty.

For extreme cases, there is no specific first aid treatment. As swelling quickly blocks the airway, suffocation may result. Urgent and highly specialized medical aid is required.
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for an SCDF. Inform dispatch that the casualty may have airway burns.
$\checkmark$ Take any steps possible to facilitate the casualty's breathing; e.g. loosen clothing around the neck.
$\checkmark$ If the casualty becomes unconscious, be prepared to provide chest compressions and use the AED.

\section*{Thermal Burns and Scalding}

Thermal burns are caused by an external heat source that raises the temperature of the skin and tissues beneath the skin, destroying cells. Scalding is also considered a form of thermal burns and occurs when hot liquid or steam comes into contact with the skin. Superficial or Partial thickness burns may result.
$\checkmark$ Remove the source of heat. Remove hot clothing if possible.
$\checkmark$ Cool the injured area with water for at least 10 minutes or until the pain is relieved.
$\checkmark$ Remove any constricting objects (jewellery, watches, belts or clothing) from the injured area before the swelling begins.
$\checkmark$ Use a sterile dressing or a clean, non-fluffy pad to bandage loosely and consult a doctor for further treatment.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT break blisters.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT use adhesive dressings.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT apply ice.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT remove anything stuck to the burn as further damage and infection may result.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT use antiseptic preparation, ointment sprays, lotions or creams to the injury.

\section*{Chemical Burn}

This occurs when caustic or corrosive substances come into contact with the skin.
$\checkmark$ Flush the area immediately with large amounts of water for 15-20 minutes or longer. Some chemicals require specific treatment, always refer to the chemical's Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for more information (see figure 95).
$\checkmark$ Wear gloves, apron and eye protection if available. Remove the casualty's contaminated clothing whilst flushing.
$\checkmark$ Cover the burned area with a dry clean dressing.
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF. Inform the dispatch that chemicals are involved.

\end{figure}

\section*{Electrical Burn}

An electrical burn is caused by electricity entering the body at the point of contact. Most of the damage occurs inside the body although the burn appears small and is seen only on the outside. The electricity normally exits where the body is in contact with a surface or the ground.
$\checkmark$ Ensure that the area is safe. Unplug, disconnect, or turn off the power.
$\checkmark$ Check for fractures and spinal injury.
$\checkmark$ Treat the casualty for shock by raising the legs and prevent heat loss by covering him with a cot or blanket.
$\checkmark$ Cover entry and exit burns.
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ Sudden Cardiac Arrest may occur. Perform Chest Compressions and use the AED if casualty's breathing stops.

\section*{Radiation Burn}

The most common type of radiation burn is sun burn caused by Ultra Violet (UV) radiation.
$\checkmark$ Remove the casualty from the sun or source of heat. Move to a cool and sheltered area or cover the affected parts with light clothing.
$\checkmark$ Encourage the casualty to stay hydrated in small amounts at a time and cool the affected skin by dabbing with water.
$\checkmark$ If signs of heat disorders are also present, treat the casualty accordingly (refer to Chapter 2) and call 995 for SCDF.

\section*{The Eye}

\section*{Structure of the Eye}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-111.jpg?height=657&width=986&top_left_y=571&top_left_x=211}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 96 - Structure of the Eye}
\end{figure}

The eyeball is situated in the eye socket and its movement is controlled by six eye muscles. The front of the eye is covered by the cornea, which is transparent. Beneath the cornea is the iris and the central opening in the iris is called the pupil. The eye is protected by the upper and lower eyelids.

\section*{Function}

The eye is protected from injury by the quick movement of the eyelids. Secretions from the eye in response to irritation and chemicals help to wash the eye.

\section*{Important Notes}
- Whenever possible, cover both the casualty's eyes with cold, wet pads.
- Always seek medical attention - call 995 for SCDF.

\section*{7.1 - Eye Injuries}

Eye injuries occur due to damage caused by a direct blow to the eye. The trauma may affect not only the eye, but the surrounding area, including adjacent tissue and bone structure.

Other forms of eye injuries can be caused by foreign bodies or chemicals and may have a high risk of long-term damage to the eyes.

Common causes of eye injuries:
- Penetration by a foreign body
- Chemicals
- Foreign bodies
- Blunt force trauma
- Cuts to the eye and eyelid

\section*{Recognition}

\section*{Penetrating Eye Injury}
- Eyeball may be collapsed due to leakage of vitreous fluid
- Penetrating object might be visible in the eye
- Movement of uninjured eye will cause pain in the injured eye

\section*{Chemicals}

Chemical burns to the eye can occur at the workplace, at home or in schools and may not even involve industrial chemicals. Common soap, detergent, hand sanitiser or shampoo may get into the eye and cause varying levels of discomfort.
- Redness and swelling
- Sharp or burning pain
- Unable to open eyes
- Tearing

\section*{Foreign Bodies}
- Pain or discomfort
- Blurred vision
- Redness and tearing
- Eyelid may be tightly closed
- Sand, wood, dust or fragments of an object may be visible

\section*{Blunt Force Trauma}
- Being hit by a blunt instrument or a fist
- "Black eye" - caused by bleeding into the eyelid and surrounding tissues

\section*{Cuts to the Eye and Eyelid}
- Being hit by a sharp or blunt instrument
- Laceration of the eyelid or conjunctiva

\section*{Actions to Take}

\section*{Penetrating Eye Injury}
$\checkmark$ Protect the injured eye with an eye pad or eye shield.
$\checkmark$ Cover the uninjured eye with a patch to stop movement of the uninjured eye.
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ If object is too large to be covered by an eye pad or eye shield, apply techniques for dealing with

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-113.jpg?height=743&width=675&top_left_y=1396&top_left_x=1142}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 97 - Eye Bandage}
\end{figure}
penetrating objects (see page 59).
- DO NOT remove any object stuck in the eye.
- DO NOT apply too much pressure to the injured eye (vitreous fluid might be lost).

\section*{Chemicals}
$\checkmark$ Place the casualty's head under a tap and rinse the eye with clean water for at least 15 to 20 minutes.
$\checkmark$ Irrigate from the nose side of the eye outwards to avoid flushing the chemical into the other eye.
$\checkmark$ Encourage the casualty to roll his or her eyeball so that the water can flush out the chemical from all parts of the eye.
$\checkmark$ Place and eye pad to the affected eyes and bandage both eyes.
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF.

\section*{Foreign Bodies}
$\checkmark$ Protect the injured eye with an eye pad or eye shield to prevent object from being driven deeper into the eye.
$\checkmark$ Cover the uninjured eye with a patch to stop movement of the uninjured eye.
$\checkmark$ Call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT allow the casualty to rub the eye.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT attempt to remove any embedded object.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT use dry cotton (cotton balls or cotton-tipped swabs) or instruments such as tweezers on the eye.

\section*{Blunt Force Trauma}
$\checkmark$ Apply a cold compress for about 15 minutes to reduce pain and swelling.
$\checkmark$ Consult a doctor immediately in case of pain, reduced vision or discolouration (black eye).

\section*{Cuts to the Eye and Eyelid}
- Loosely bandage both eyes.
- Call 995 for SCDF.
- DO NOT flush the eye with water.
- DO NOT apply too much pressure to the injured eye (vitreous fluid might be lost).

\section*{7.2 - Epistaxis (Nose Bleeding)}

Nosebleeds are common in children but may occur in adults as well. Other causes may also be due to injury to the nose, picking of nose dry climate, frequent nose blowing. The bleeding is usually minor in most cases. A nosebleed after a head injury should be taken seriously and medical attention should be sought, as it may suggest a possible skull fracture.

\section*{Actions to Take}
$\checkmark$ Sit the casualty down with his/her head slightly forward. Allow a small bowl for the child to spit in if necessary.
$\checkmark$ Help the casualty pinch the fleshy part of the nose for 10 minutes, asking him/her to breathe through his open mouth.
$\checkmark$ If the bleeding continues, reapply the pressure for another 10 minutes. Most nosebleeds should stop within 20 to 30 minutes. If it persists for more than half an hour, you should seek medical attention.
$\checkmark$ After the bleeding has stopped, advise the casualty to rest for a few hours.

\section*{7.3 - Poisoning}

Poisoning is a process or condition when a casualty becomes harmed (poisoned) by a toxic substance. Poisoning can be acute (sudden or over a very short period of time) or chronic (over a prolonged period of time). Depending on the length of exposure and dose, effects may range from temporary to

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-116.jpg?height=535&width=889&top_left_y=468&top_left_x=928}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 98 - Routes of Poisoning}
\end{figure}
irreversible damage or death.

Poison may enter the body through breathing (inhalation), skin contact (absorption/injection) or by mouth (ingestion) (see figure 98).

\section*{Recognition}

Depending on the substance, dose and exposure, the signs and symptoms may vary and may include the following (but not limited to):
- Altered levels of consciousness and may lead to unconsciousness
- Breathing difficulty
- Corrosive burns around the mouth if substance was ingested
- Vomiting and/or diarrhoea
- Presence of poisonous substances nearby
- Corrosive burn marks if the substance was absorbed through the skin
- History of substance abuse (eg. puncture marks on skin)
- Headache, nausea or giddiness

\section*{Actions to Take}
$\checkmark$ Perform the Primary Survey. If casualty is unresponsive and not breathing, start chest compressions and apply an AED (see Chapter 8).
$\checkmark$ For poisoning cases in a workplace involving substances used during the work process, refer to the instructions on the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) and follow the emergency procedures established for such incidents. If such procedures are not in place or you are unsure, call 995 for SCDF and inform them that chemicals (type and amount if known) are involved. Keep the casualty calm and minimise the casualty's movements.
$\checkmark$ For poisoning cases in a domestic or household setting, keep the casualty calm and minimise the casualty's movements. Call 995 for SCDF.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT leave the casualty unattended at any time. Monitor the casualty and record the vital signs at regular intervals. If casualty is conscious and alert, get a detailed history.
$\checkmark$ Ensure personal safety when handling the substance (eg. chemical, pesticide, detergent, syringe with needles, bottles, etc). Inform SCDF of the suspected substance and bring the substance's container along to the hospital.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT force the casualty to vomit unless it is a natural body reaction.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT force the casualty to drink more water unless advised by SCDF or a Doctor.

\section*{7.4 - Transportation of Casualty}

Important factors when considering BEFORE moving the casualty:
- It is always ideal to wait for the arrival of the Ambulance crew and take instructions from them.
- DO NOT move the casualty unnecessarily unless there is immediate danger or casualty is exposed to harsh weather elements.
- DO NOT leave the casualty alone. Send someone else to get help.
- If the casualty is seriously injured or has multiple injuries, it may be better to attend to him where he is, because movement may cause further injuries.
- Consider the terrain or environment when moving the casualty.
- Communicate with other First Aiders of the transport/evacuation plan.
- Always ensure the safety of both the casualty and other First Aiders or assistants during the transportation process.
- Plan for a short stop every few minutes to check on the casualty and allow a change of hands if needed.

To move the casualty, the following methods may be used:
- Support by a single rescuer
- Handseats and the "kitchen chair" carry
- Blanket lift
- Stretcher
- Wheeled transport (e.g. wheelchair)

\section*{Principles of Lifting}
- Know your capabilities. Do not try to handle too heavy a load - seek help.
- Keep your back straight. Tighten the muscles of the buttocks and abdomen.
- Apply a safe grip. Use as much of the palms as possible.
- Position your feet shoulder width apart for balance, with one foot in front of the other.
- When lifting, do not twist your back; pivot with your feet.
- While lifting and carrying, do so in a slow motion and smooth motion, in unison with other rescuers.
- Before moving a casualty, inform him/her about what you are going to do.

\section*{One Rescuer Methods}

The following methods should only be used by a First Aider when a casualty cannot be lifted, or is incapable of standing up, but needs to be moved from danger promptly. Avoid using any of these methods if you suspect that the casualty has sustained neck or head injuries.

\section*{Shoulder Drag}
$\checkmark$ Used for short distances over a rough surface
$\checkmark$ Stabilize the casualty's head with your forearms
$\checkmark$ Crouch behind the casualty, help him/her to sit up, and cross his/her arms over his/her chest
$\checkmark$ Pass your arms under the casualty's armpits and grasp his/her wrists
$\checkmark$ Carefully pull casualty backwards.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT use this method if there are

shoulder, head or neck injuries.

\section*{Human Crutch}
$\checkmark$ If one of the casualty's legs is injured, help him/her to walk on the good leg while you support the injured side.
$\checkmark$ Stand at his/her injured side, except when there is an injury to an upper limb.
$\checkmark$ Assist the casualty by putting your arm round his/her waist, grasp the clothing at the hip, and place his/her arm round your neck, holding his/her hand with your free hand.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-119.jpg?height=732&width=515&top_left_y=1864&top_left_x=1279}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 100 - Human Crutch}
\end{figure}
$\checkmark$ Move off with your inside foot. Take small steps and walk at the casualty's pace.
$\checkmark$ Reassure the casualty as you move.
$\checkmark$ If his/her upper limbs are uninjured and the other hand is free, the casualty may obtain additional help from a second supporter, or by using a walking stick.

\section*{Cradle Carry}
- Used when lightweight casualties are unable to walk.
- Lift the casualty by passing one of your arms beneath both the knees, with the casualty's neck resting on the bend of the elbow of your other arm.

\end{figure}

\section*{Fireman's Carry}
$\checkmark$ If the casualty's injuries permit, longer distances can be travelled with the casualty carried over your shoulder.
$\checkmark$ Help the casualty to stand.
$\checkmark$ Grasp casualty's right/left wrist with your left/right hand.
$\checkmark$ Squat down with your head under his/her extended right/left arm so that your right/left shoulder is level with the lower part of casualty's abdomen; and place your right/left arm between or around his/her legs.
$\checkmark$ Taking the weight on your right/left shoulder, rise to a standing position.
$\checkmark$ Pull the casualty across both

shoulders and transfer his/her right/left wrist to your right/left hand, leaving your other hand free.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT use this method if the casualty is heavier/bigger than you.

\section*{Pick-a-Back Carry}
$\checkmark$ When injuries make the fireman's carry unsafe, this method is used
$\checkmark$ Crouch in front of the conscious casualty, with your back to him
$\checkmark$ Ask the casualty to put his arms over your shoulders and clasp his hands in front of you
$\checkmark$ Grasp the casualty's thighs and rise slowly, keeping your back straight.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\section*{Two Rescuers Methods}

\section*{Two-handed Seat Carry}
$\checkmark$ This method is mostly used to carry a casualty who is unable to assist first aiders with his/her arms.
$\checkmark$ Two first aiders face each other and stoop at each side of the casualty
$\checkmark$ Each first aider passes his forearm nearest the casualty's body behind his back just below the shoulders, taking hold of his clothing
$\checkmark$ They slightly raise the casualty's back and pass their other forearm under the middle of his thighs, clasping their hands together with the hook-grip.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-121.jpg?height=606&width=1355&top_left_y=1847&top_left_x=371}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 104 - Two-Handed Seat Carry}
\end{figure}
$\checkmark$ To clasp their hands together, the first aider on the left of the casualty faces his palm upwards whilst the first aider on the right faces his palm downwards
$\checkmark$ To prevent their fingernails from hurting each other's hand, a folded handkerchief can be used as a buffer
$\checkmark$ The first aiders then rise together and step off, the one on the right side with his right foot and the one on the left side with his/her left foot.

\section*{Four-handed Seat Carry}
$\checkmark$ This is the easiest method for two persons to carry a casualty when no equipment is available.
$\checkmark$ The casualty cannot walk but is able to assist by using one or both arms to hang onto the first aiders.
$\checkmark$ With two First Aiders facing each other positioned behind the casualty, their left hands grasp each other's right wrists, and their right hands grasp their own left wrists.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-122.jpg?height=707&width=643&top_left_y=793&top_left_x=1136}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 105 - Four-Handed Seat Carry}
\end{figure}
$\checkmark$ With both First Aiders stooping down, the casualty is then instructed to place one arm around the neck of each first aider, so as to raise him/her to sit on their hands and steady himself/herself during transportation.
$\checkmark$ The First Aiders then rise together and step off with their outer feet, walking at an ordinary pace.

\section*{Fore-and-Aft Carry}
$\checkmark$ One First Aider carries the casualty below the armpits, holding onto the linked forearms of the casualty.
$\checkmark$ The second First Aider carries the casualty at the knees.

\begin{figure}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}

\end{figure}

\section*{Improvised Methods}

\section*{Chair Carry}
$\checkmark$ A useful method when a conscious casualty without any serious injuries, is to be transported along narrow passageways or up/down the stairs.
$\checkmark$ A kitchen/dinning chair that is strong enough to take the casualty's weight should be used.
$\checkmark$ The casualty should be seated on the chair and supported by First Aiders at the front and rear.
$\checkmark$ The casualty and the chair are then slowly tilted backwards at a slight angle (about 30 degrees) and lifted.
$\checkmark$ One First Aider should support the back of the chair with the casualty on it; the other should hold the chair by the front legs and move carefully down the stairs.
$\checkmark$ If the staircase or passageway is wide enough, the First Aiders can stand at

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
the sides of the chair, each supporting a back and front leg.

\section*{Blanket/Sheet Pull}
$\checkmark$ Roll the casualty onto a blanket/sheet and pull it from behind casualty's head.
$\checkmark$ DO NOT use this method over rough or bumpy surfaces.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_ceea61e72359f77d065fg-123.jpg?height=444&width=621&top_left_y=1701&top_left_x=1193}
