                        <p>The eyeball is situated in the eye socket and its movement is controlled by six eye muscles. The front of the eye is covered by the cornea, which is transparent.

                        <p>The eye is protected from injury by the quick movement of the eyelids. Secretions from the eye in response to irritation and chemicals help to wash the eye.</p>

                        <ul>
                           <li>Know your capabilities. Do not try to handle too heavy a load - seek help.</li>
                           <li>Keep your back straight. Tighten the muscles of the buttocks and abdomen.</li>
                           <li>Apply a safe grip. Use as much of the palms as possible.</li>
                           <li>Position your feet shoulder width apart for balance, with one foot in front of the other.</li>
                           <li>When lifting, do not twist your back; pivot with your feet.</li>
                           <li>While lifting and carrying, do so in a slow motion and smooth motion, in unison with other rescuers.</li>
                           <li>Before moving a casualty, inform him/her about what you are going to do.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>One Rescuer Methods</h4>
                        <p>The following methods should only be used by a First Aider when a casualty cannot be lifted, or is incapable of standing up, but needs to be moved from danger promptly. Avoid using any of these methods if you suspect that the casualty has sustained neck or head injuries.</p>
