                        <p>The respiratory system comprises of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nasal cavity</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Function</h3>
                        <p>The functions of the respiratory system are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To provide oxygen for use in the body</li>
                            <li>To excrete carbon dioxide</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Respiration involved the process of breathing and the exchange of gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs, and in cells throughout the body.</p>
                        <p>We breathe in air in order to take oxygen into the lungs and breathe out to expel the waste gas carbon dioxide, a by-product of respiration. When we breathe, air is drawn in through the nose and mouth into the airway and the lungs.</p>
                        <p>In the lungs, oxygen is taken from air sacs (alveoli) into blood vessels (pulmonary [lung] capillaries). At the same time, carbon dioxide is released from the capillaries into the alveoli and expelled as we breathe out (see figure 21).</p>

                        <p>During inspiration (breathing in) the chest cavity is enlarged. The lungs which are elastic, expand to fill up the increased space, and air is sucked in. Two main factors enlarge the chest cavity:</p>

                            <li>Upward and outward movement of the ribs caused by the action of the inter-costal muscle.</li>

                                    <li>The airway, a passage leading from the nose to the lungs. This passage allows a free flow of air in and out of the lungs during respiration.</li>

                            <li>Ensure the scene is safe to enter. In cases of poisoning by gases, fumes or lack of oxygen in and enclosed space, the casualty should be moved to a well-ventilated place.</li>
                            <li>Reassure the casualty to allay his anxiety and panic.</li>
                            <li>Find out from the casualty what happened to him to determine the cause for his breathing difficulty, if he is conscious.</li>
                            <li>Perform the Primary Survey and commence CPR and use the AED if the casualty is not breathing.</li>
                            <li>If the casualty does not respond, call 995 for SCDF.</li>
                            <li>Check to see whether there are any obstructions in the mouth, e.g. foreign bodies, food, dentures, vomitus etc.</li>
                            <li>If the casualty is unconscious but breathing normally, place him/her in the recovery position (see Chapter 2). However, do not turn or move the casualty if neck or spinal injury is suspected.</li>
                            <li>Do not leave the casualty unattended at any time. Monitor the casualty and record the vital signs at regular intervals.</li>

                        <p>Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO) can be either partial or complete. Coughing is the body's natural defence against airway obstruction.</p>
                        <p>A casualty with partial (mild) airway obstruction will cough to expel the foreign body. If the casualty is wheezing (breathing noisily with a wheezing sound) or coughing, this means that the airway is partially obstructed. Do not interfere. Allow the casualty to cough to expel the object himself/herself.</p>

                        <p>Techniques used to relieve FBAO include the Heimlich Manoeuvre (abdominal thrusts) and chest thrusts for pregnant and obese casualties. The Heimlich Maneuver, also known as the sub-diaphragmatic abdominal thrusts or abdominal thrusts is recommended for the relief of FBAO in responsive adults (more than 8 years of age) and children (1 to 8 years of age). The Heimlich Maneuver elevates the diaphragm and increase airway pressure, which forces air out from the lungs. This creates an artificial cough which can expel the foreign body from the airway. In obese or pregnant casualties, chest thrusts should be used instead of abdominal thrusts.</p>

                        <p>Fumes or smoke that have accumulated in a confined space can quickly overcome anyone who is not wearing protective equipment. A burning building presents not only the fire itself, but also falling structures as well as dangers from fumes and smoke.</p>
                        <p>Any person who has been enclosed in a confined space during a fire should be assumed to have inhaled smoke. Smoke from burning plastics, foam padding and synthetic wall coverings will probably contain poisonous fumes. Casualties should also be examined for other injuries sustained as a result of the fire.</p>

                        <p>This highly dangerous gas prevents the blood from carrying oxygen. It is tasteless and odourless. A large amount of carbon monoxide in the air, such as in a confined space, can kill a person very quickly. Lengthy exposure to a slow leak from a faulty gas heater may also cause severe, possibly fatal poisoning.</p>

                        <p>Allergies are an overreaction of the body's natural defence system that helps fight infections (immune system). The immune system normally protects the body from viruses and bacteria by producing antibodies to fight them. In an allergic reaction, the immune system starts fighting substances that are usually harmless (such as dust mites, pollen, or a medicine) as though these substances were trying to attack the body.</p>
                        <p>An allergic reaction may not occur during the first exposure to an allergyproducing substance (allergen). For example, the first time you are stung by a bee, you may have only pain and redness from the sting. If you are stung again, you may have hives or trouble breathing. This is caused by the response of the immune system.</p>
                        <p>Many people will have some problem with allergies or allergic reactions at some point in their lives. Allergic reactions can range from mild and annoying to sudden and life-threatening.</p>
                        <p>Anaphylactic shock is failure of the circulation due to a severe allergic reaction within the body in response to something either taken by mouth, or comes into contact with the body, or was injected.</p>
