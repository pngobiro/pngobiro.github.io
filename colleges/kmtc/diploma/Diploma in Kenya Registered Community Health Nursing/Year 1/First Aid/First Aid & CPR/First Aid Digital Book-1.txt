\section*{The Red Cross}

\section*{The Fundamental Principles}

Humanity: We serve people, but not systems.
Impartiality: We care for the victims and the aggressors alike.
Neutrality: We take initiatives, but never take sides.
Independence: We bow to needs, but not rulers.
Voluntary Service: We work around the clock, but never for personal gain.
Unity: We have many talents, but a single idea.
Universality: We respect nations, but our work knows no bounds.

\section*{Red Cross Symbols}

There are three official symbols (red cross, red crescent, and red crystal) used to identify the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. These symbols are recognized around the world as signs of protection and neutrality. +

\section*{How We Help}

\section*{Responding to Emergencies}

\section*{Preparing to Respond}

\section*{First Aid Kit}

Keep a well-stocked and regularly inspected first aid kit in your home, car, and workplace.

\section*{Willingness to Act}

Sometimes people don't want to get involved in an emergency. The four most
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-05.jpg?height=455&width=570&top_left_y=561&top_left_x=862)
common reasons are:
1. The Bystander Effect: "Someone else will look after the person." Never assume that someone will take action. Offer to help in any way you can.
2. Unpleasant injuries or illnesses: "That makes me feel sick!" Close your eyes or turn away for a moment to calm yourself, then deal with the situation.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-05.jpg?height=463&width=597&top_left_y=1066&top_left_x=858)
3. Fear of catching a disease: "I don't want to get sick!" Taking simple steps, such as wearing gloves, will limit the risk of catching a disease.
4. Fear of doing something wrong or causing more harm: "What if I make the person worse?" The most harmful thing you can do is nothing at all.

\section*{Legal Issues Around First Aid}

First Aiders must:
- Get permission, if possible, before giving care.
- Give only the care they were trained to provide.
- Continue giving care until another trained person takes over, they are too exhausted to continue, the scene becomes unsafe, or the person's condition improves and care is no longer required.

\section*{Getting Permission to Help}

You must get permission (consent) before giving care.
- For an unresponsive person, the law assumes you have permission.
- For a young child without a caregiver, provide care.
- If a person refuses care, call EMS/9-1-1.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-06.jpg?height=537&width=709&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=797)

\section*{Duty to Report Child Abuse or Neglect}

Every adult in Canada has a legal duty to report child abuse or neglect, even if it is not confirmed. Information around the specific how-to-report details can be found in your jurisdiction's child protection act, but the duty to report is uniform in all acts. If you think a child is being harmed, then a report to child protection and/or the police needs to occur.

\section*{Chain of Survival Behaviours}

The Chain of Survival Behaviours is a series of actions that, if integrated together, will help ensure a positive outcome for an ill or injured person.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-06.jpg?height=764&width=1337&top_left_y=1342&top_left_x=173)

\section*{Your Role as a First Aider}

1．Recognize the emergency．
2．Protect yourself and others．
3．Access help（one of the simplest and most important ways of providing first aid）．
4．Act according to your skills and training．

\section*{The Emergency Medical Services System}

The emergency medical services（EMS）system
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-07.jpg?height=544&width=535&top_left_y=113&top_left_x=906)
is a network of community resources and trained personnel organized to give emergency care in cases of injury or sudden illness．

\section*{When to Call EMS／9－1－1}

Call EMS／9－1－1 if there is a danger to you or others or if a person：
－Is not easily accessible．
－Is unresponsive or has an altered mental state．
－Is not breathing normally．
－Has persistent chest pain or pressure．
－Has life－threatening bleeding．
－Has a seizure．
－Has a head，neck，or spinal injury．
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-07.jpg?height=542&width=532&top_left_y=825&top_left_x=909)
－Has an apparent mental health crisis．

\section*{After an Emergency}

Being involved in an emergency and providing first aid can be stressful．After the emergency is resolved，you may have lingering feelings such as uneasiness， doubt，anxiety，and fear．It is often helpful to talk to somebody about the situation．

Consider seeking professional help（such as from your family doctor or mental health professional）if you experience any of the following for more than two weeks after the emergency：
－Crying fits or uncontrollable anger
－Trouble eating or sleeping
－Loss of engagement with former interests
－Feelings of guilt，helplessness，or hopelessness
－Avoiding family and friends
－Ignoring daily tasks，such as going to work

\section*{Lowering the Risk of Infection}

\section*{Equipment Precautions}
"Personal protective equipment" ("PPE") are items that protect you from contact with germs. You should always use some type of barrier device when giving first aid.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-08.jpg?height=381&width=1084&top_left_y=410&top_left_x=354)

\section*{Removing Gloves}
1. Touching only the outer surface, pull the glove off your hand, form it into a ball, and hold it in the palm of your gloved hand.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-08.jpg?height=467&width=625&top_left_y=1122&top_left_x=176)
3. Pull the glove off the hand, trapping the balled glove inside, and discard appropriately.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-08.jpg?height=465&width=616&top_left_y=1811&top_left_x=185)
2. Insert your fingers under the rim of the glove on your other hand.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-08.jpg?height=462&width=616&top_left_y=1127&top_left_x=890)
4. Wash your hands properly.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-08.jpg?height=467&width=646&top_left_y=1809&top_left_x=890)

\section*{Handwashing}
1. Take off your jewellery, wet your hands, and then apply soap.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-09.jpg?height=481&width=643&top_left_y=315&top_left_x=125)
3. Dry with a towel.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-09.jpg?height=488&width=648&top_left_y=911&top_left_x=120)
2. Rub your hands together for at least 30 seconds and rinse.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-09.jpg?height=486&width=651&top_left_y=315&top_left_x=825)
4. If you are in a public washroom, turn the faucet off using the towel.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-09.jpg?height=402&width=658&top_left_y=997&top_left_x=818)

If handwashing facilities are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to clean your hands.
Clean under your fingernails by rubbing them against the palms of your hands. Be sure also to scrub your palms and wrists, the skin between your fingers, and the backs of your hands.

\section*{Check, Call, Care}

When you encounter an ill or injured person, you will repeat the check, call, and care steps until the person's condition improves or EMS personnel arrive.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-10.jpg?height=1476&width=1330&top_left_y=728&top_left_x=167)

\section*{Check}

Once you recognize an emergency, you must first check the scene, and then check the person.

Check the Scene
Before approaching an ill or injured person, stop and take a good look at the scene:
- Is the scene safe?
- Are there any hazards?
-What happened?
- How did it happen?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-11.jpg?height=658&width=493&top_left_y=406&top_left_x=953)

Check the Person (Primary Assessment) If the scene is safe, quickly check the person:
1. Check whether the person is responsive.
2. Check the person's ABCs:
- Airway
- Breathing
- Circulation
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-11.jpg?height=560&width=502&top_left_y=1136&top_left_x=955)

\section*{Checking ABCs}

\section*{A = CHECK THE AIRWAY}

Make sure the person has an open airway. If the person is speaking, moaning, or crying, the person's airway is open.

If the person is unresponsive, perform a head-tilt/chinlift by gently tilting the head back until the chin is pointing up.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-12.jpg?height=456&width=404&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=1106)

\section*{B = CHECK BREATHING}

Check for normal breathing for 5 to 10 seconds. A person is breathing normally if air is moving into and out of the lungs and the chest is rising and falling in a normal, regular pattern. Someone who can speak or cry is breathing.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-12.jpg?height=463&width=407&top_left_y=732&top_left_x=1106)

\section*{C = CHECK CIRCULATION}

Quickly look at the person from head to toe for signs of life-threatening bleeding.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-12.jpg?height=453&width=398&top_left_y=1266&top_left_x=1108)

A person who is not breathing normally may be occasionally gasping for air: This is a reflex action called "agonal respiration." Unlike normal breathing, it is irregular and sporadic. Care for the person as if he or she is not breathing.

Unresponsiveness, difficulty breathing, and life-threatening bleeding are life-threatening emergencies. These conditions must be your top priority. Obtain an automated external defibrillator (AED) and first aid kit if these items are available.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-13.jpg?height=244&width=245&top_left_y=111&top_left_x=115)

\section*{Call}

If an individual is unresponsive or has a life-threatening condition, you must always activate EMS. Whenever possible, use a mobile phone or ask a bystander to call EMS/9-1-1.

If you are alone with the person and you do not have a mobile phone, call out loudly for help. If no one comes, get to a phone as quickly as you can and call
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-13.jpg?height=687&width=595&top_left_y=118&top_left_x=848)
EMS/9-1-1. As soon as you hang up, return to the person.

If a person becomes unresponsive, his or her vital signs deteriorate, or your secondary assessment reveals a condition that requires emergency care, call EMS/9-1-1 immediately.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-13.jpg?height=244&width=245&top_left_y=1215&top_left_x=115)

\section*{Care}

Care for any lifethreatening conditions first. Give the care that is needed, within the scope of your knowledge and training. Continue to Check, Call, and Care, providing continual care with these guidelines:
- Monitor the person's breathing, level of responsiveness, and overall condition.
- Help the person rest in a comfortable position.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-13.jpg?height=685&width=597&top_left_y=1224&top_left_x=848)
- If necessary, roll the person into the recovery position.
- Keep the person from getting chilled or overheated.
- Reassure the person.

\section*{Recovery Position}

A person who is unresponsive or has an altered level of responsiveness should be rolled into the recovery position.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-14.jpg?height=444&width=1383&top_left_y=289&top_left_x=153)

When placing a person in the recovery position, remember:
- Support and protect the head while rolling the person.
- Try to roll the person as one unit (head, back, and legs at the same time).
- Roll the person into a position where the body will stay safely on its side.
- Check the ABCs after you complete the roll.

\section*{Helping a Person With Medication}

You should help a person take his or her medication only if:
- It is safe to do so.
- The person is responsive and has in some way expressed a need for help finding, preparing, and/or taking the medication.

\section*{FINDING THE MEDICATION}

Find the medication and review all information on the package, including the name of the medication, any instructions or warnings, and, in the case of prescription medication, the person's name.

\section*{PREPARING THE MEDICATION}

Follow the instructions on the label to prepare the medication for the person to ingest, inhale, or inject.

\section*{GUIDING THE PERSON IN TAKING THE MEDICATION}

Guide the person in taking the medication by reading the instructions to the person and/or showing the person how to take the medication.

\section*{GIVING LIFESAVING MEDICATION}

Rescue inhalers and epinephrine auto-injectors are lifesaving medications. If the person cannot give him- or herself lifesaving medication, prepare it, obtain permission, and either press the inhaler's plunger or inject the epinephrine for the person.

\section*{Secondary Assessment}

Once you are confident that all life-threatening conditions have been addressed, perform a secondary assessment to check for conditions that may not be as obvious. The secondary assessment consists of three steps:

\section*{1. Ask SAMPLE Questions}

Interview the ill or injured person and any bystanders at the scene using the acronym SAMPLE to guide your questions:

Signs and symptoms
A llergies
Medications
$\mathbf{P}$ ast medical history
L ast oral intake (food or drink)
E vents leading up to the emergency
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-15.jpg?height=681&width=597&top_left_y=375&top_left_x=853)

\section*{2. Check the Vital Signs}

\section*{LEVEL OF RESPONSIVENESS}

Is the person alert, sleepy, or confused? Is the person's responsiveness changing?

\section*{BREATHING}

Listen for sounds. Is the breathing fast or slow? Shallow or deep? Painful?

\section*{SKIN}

Is skin dry or wet? An unusual colour or temperature?

\section*{3. Perform an Injury Check}

Look carefully for injuries that were not identified during the primary assessment. An injury check may involve a focused examination or a hands-on check. If you find a medical-identification product during your check, read it carefully.

\section*{Focused Examination}

If the person is responsive and able to answer questions, do a focused examination. If the person's condition deteriorates, respond immediately (e.g., call EMS/9-1-1, provide care).
1. Explain that the purpose of the examination is to identify injuries.
2. Ask the person if anything hurts or feels uncomfortable.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-16.jpg?height=354&width=460&top_left_y=345&top_left_x=1018)
3. If the person indicates an area of pain or concern, look at the area for signs of injury.
4. Ask focused questions about how the person feels.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-16.jpg?height=356&width=504&top_left_y=765&top_left_x=1011)

\section*{Hands-On Check}

If a person is breathing but unresponsive or unable to communicate, you may need to do a hands-on check. Begin by checking the head for injuries, and then work downward, focusing on the chest, abdomen, and legs before checking the arms.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-16.jpg?height=444&width=1381&top_left_y=1437&top_left_x=153)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-16.jpg?height=458&width=1381&top_left_y=1894&top_left_x=150)

\section*{Shock}

Be on the lookout for shock when providing care for any injury or sudden illness or whenever someone has been involved in a serious incident. Shock is a life-threatening condition.

\section*{What to Look For}

The following are signs and symptoms of shock:
- Anxiety or confusion
- Cool, clammy skin that may be paler than normal
- Weakness
- Excessive thirst
- Rapid breathing
- Drowsiness or loss of responsiveness
- Nausea and vomiting

\section*{(s) Call}

Call EMS/9-1-1.

\section*{Care}

People in shock need medical care. Call EMS/9-1-1 if you haven't already done so. While you are waiting for EMS personnel to arrive:
1. Care for the suspected cause of the shock.
2. Provide continual care.

\section*{4 Choking}

If the person is able to cough or speak, his or her airway is not completely blocked. Encourage the person to cough and be prepared to provide care if the person stops coughing. If the person's airway is completely blocked, you must begin first aid immediately.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-18.jpg?height=539&width=669&top_left_y=563&top_left_x=837)

\section*{Adult or Child}

\section*{Call}

Immediately begin providing care. Call EMS/9-1-1 as soon as you or a bystander is able to do so.

\section*{Care}
1. Alternate between any two of the following methods until the object comes out: back blows, abdominal thrusts, and chest thrusts.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-23.jpg?height=581&width=643&top_left_y=1495&top_left_x=816)

\section*{Applying a Tourniquet}

The following situations may require a tourniquet:
- The bleeding cannot be controlled using direct pressure.
- You are unable to access the wound.
- You must move the person and are unable to maintain direct pressure.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-24.jpg?height=417&width=588&top_left_y=78&top_left_x=918)
1. Apply the tourniquet: It should be one hand's width above the injury and at least two fingers' width above any joint.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-24.jpg?height=416&width=629&top_left_y=765&top_left_x=176)

Care
1. Have the person rest quietly until EMS personnel arrive.

> A person with life-threatening internal bleeding may be very thirsty, but giving anything by mouth (even water) can cause serious complications.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-26.jpg?height=347&width=230&top_left_y=92&top_left_x=169)

\section*{CPR and AED}

\section*{Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)}

CPR is used when a person is unresponsive and not breathing.

Call
Have someone call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED.

\section*{Adult}

If you are alone, call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED yourself.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-26.jpg?height=506&width=718&top_left_y=633&top_left_x=788)

\section*{Child or Baby}

If you are alone, do 5 cycles ( 2 minutes) of CPR before taking the child or baby with you to call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED.

\section*{Compression-Only CPR}

Compression-only CPR uses chest compressions (without rescue breaths) to pump the heart. If you are unwilling or unable to give rescue breaths for any reason, compression-only CPR is acceptable. Traditional CPR with rescue breaths is the recommended method of care for children and babies.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-26.jpg?height=615&width=862&top_left_y=1484&top_left_x=672)

\section*{Adult or Child}
1. Do 30 chest compressions:
- Put 2 hands in the centre of the person's chest.
- Push deeply and steadily, allowing the chest to recoil between compressions.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-27.jpg?height=523&width=648&top_left_y=338&top_left_x=779)
2. Give 2 breaths:
- Open the airway.
- Place your barrier device over the person's mouth and nose, and if using a flat plastic shield, pinch the person's nostrils.
- Give just enough air to make the chest start to rise.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-27.jpg?height=574&width=1328&top_left_y=1192&top_left_x=115)
3. If both breaths go in, repeat the cycle of 30 compressions and 2 breaths.

You should do compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute. This works out to 30 compressions in about 15 to 18 seconds.

\section*{Baby (Less Than 1 Year)}
1. Do 30 chest compressions:
- Put 2 fingers in the centre of the baby's chest, just below the nipple line.
- Push deeply and steadily, allowing the chest to recoil between compressions.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-28.jpg?height=729&width=1337&top_left_y=415&top_left_x=171)
2. Give 2 breaths:
- Open the airway.
- Place your barrier device over the baby's mouth and nose.
- Give just enough air to make the chest start to rise.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-28.jpg?height=729&width=1340&top_left_y=1417&top_left_x=173)
3. If both breaths go in, repeat the cycle of 30 compressions and 2 breaths.

\section*{CPR Compression Depth}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-29.jpg?height=437&width=1323&top_left_y=192&top_left_x=120)

Once you begin CPR, continue until:
- EMS personnel or another person takes over.
- You are too tired to continue.
- The scene becomes unsafe.
- You notice an obvious sign of life, such as movement.

\begin{figure}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{What to Do If the Rescue Breaths Don't Go In}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-29.jpg?height=706&width=1335&top_left_y=1022&top_left_x=115}
\end{figure}

If the chest does not rise after the first breath, try repositioning the head. If that doesn't work, look in the person's mouth for an object. Continue to look into the person's mouth after each set of compressions until the airway is clear. Once the rescue breaths go in, continue CPR normally.

\section*{Automated External Defibrillation (AED)}

Whenever you give CPR, you should also use an automated external defibrillator (AED). While CPR can help prevent brain damage and death by keeping oxygenated blood moving throughout the body, an AED can correct the underlying problem for some people who go into sudden cardiac arrest.

\section*{Using an AED}
1. Open and turn on the AED.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-30.jpg?height=381&width=648&top_left_y=575&top_left_x=183)

If possible, use the appropriate size of pads—adult, child, or baby. Pads must be placed at least 2.5 cm ( 1 in .) apart. If there is not enough space on the chest, place one pad on the chest and one on the back.
2. Apply the AED pads:
- Remove any clothing, jewellery, and medical patches that could interfere with pad placement.
- If the chest is wet, dry the skin.
- Place the pads at least 2.5 cm (1 in.) away from a pacemaker.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-30.jpg?height=384&width=578&top_left_y=985&top_left_x=937)
3. Follow the AED's automated prompts.
4. If the AED prompts you to do so, ensure that no one is touching the person and deliver a shock.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-30.jpg?height=342&width=497&top_left_y=1419&top_left_x=937)
5. Continue CPR , starting with compressions.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-30.jpg?height=368&width=655&top_left_y=1929&top_left_x=176)

You must remove a person from water before using an AED. It is safe to use an AED on ice or snow.

\section*{7 \\ Breathing Emergencies}

\section*{Poisoning Caused by Alcohol or Drugs}

Provide care based on the method the person used to take the drug (e.g., swallowed or injected).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-60.jpg?height=393&width=829&top_left_y=287&top_left_x=447)

Look for clues as to what drug was taken and give this information to EMS personnel when they arrive. Because drugs can significantly alter a person's perception and/or behaviour, you must be careful to protect yourself. If the person is aggressive, call EMS/9-1-1.

Opioid drugs, such as heroin and fentanyl, are a common cause of drug overdose. Opioid overdoses can cause respiratory failure and death. Naloxone is a drug used to quickly reverse the effects of an opioid drug overdose.

\section*{Insect Stings}

2. Apply a cold pack wrapped in a thin, dry towel.

\section*{Tick Bites}

\section*{Care}

If the tick hasn't started to dig into the flesh, brush it off the skin.

If the tick has begun to bite:
1. Use tweezers to grasp the tick by the head as close to the person's skin as possible.
2. Pull upward without twisting until the tick releases its hold. If you cannot
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_7e71eb758ccec497a937g-62.jpg?height=421&width=580&top_left_y=301&top_left_x=930)
remove the tick or if its mouthparts stay in the skin, the person should seek medical attention.
3. If the tick is removed, wash the area with clean water.
4. If the area becomes infected or the person develops a fever or rash, the person should seek medical attention.

Save any tick you remove in a sealable bag or empty pill bottle, and bring it to the medical appointment. Ticks can be tested for diseases such as Lyme disease and so can help to diagnose your condition.
