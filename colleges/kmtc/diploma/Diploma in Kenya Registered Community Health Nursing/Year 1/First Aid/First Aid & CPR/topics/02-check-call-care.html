                        <h4>LEVEL OF RESPONSIVENESS</h4>
                        <p>Is the person alert, sleepy, or confused? Is the person's responsiveness changing?</p>
                        <h4>BREATHING</h4>
                        <p>Listen for sounds. Is the breathing fast or slow? Shallow or deep? Painful?</p>
                        <h4>SKIN</h4>
                        <p>Is skin dry or wet? An unusual colour or temperature?</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Perform an Injury Check</h3>
                        <p>Look carefully for injuries that were not identified during the primary assessment. An injury check may involve a focused examination or a hands-on check. If you find a medical-identification product during your check, read it carefully.</p>

                        <h4>Focused Examination</h4>
                        <p>If the person is responsive and able to answer questions, do a focused examination. If the person's condition deteriorates, respond immediately (e.g., call EMS/9-1-1, provide care).</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Explain that the purpose of the examination is to identify injuries.</li>

                            <li>Ask the person if anything hurts or feels uncomfortable.</li>
                            <li>If the person indicates an area of pain or concern, look at the area for signs of injury.</li>
                            <li>Ask focused questions about how the person feels.</li>

                        <h4>Hands-On Check</h4>
                        <p>If a person is breathing but unresponsive or unable to communicate, you may need to do a hands-on check. Begin by checking the head for injuries, and then work downward, focusing on the chest, abdomen, and legs before checking the arms.</p>
