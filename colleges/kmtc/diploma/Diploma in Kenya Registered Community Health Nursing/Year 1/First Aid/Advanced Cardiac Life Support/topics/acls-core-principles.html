                        <p>Understanding normal cardiac anatomy and physiology is an important component of performing ACLS. The heart is a hollow muscle composed of four chambers surrounded by thick walls of tissue (septum). The atria are the two upper chambers and the ventricles are the two lower chambers. The left and right halves of the heart work together to pump blood throughout the body. The right atrium (RA) and the right ventricle (RV) pump deoxygenated blood to the lungs where it becomes oxygenated. This oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium (LA) and then enters the left ventricle (LV). The LV is the main pump that delivers the newly oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.</p>
                        <p>Blood leaves the heart through a large vessel known as the aorta. Valves between each pair of connected chambers prevent the backflow of blood. The two atria contract simultaneously, as do the ventricles, making the contractions of the heart go from top to bottom. Each beat begins in the RA. The LV is the largest and thickest-walled of the four chambers, as it is responsible for pumping the newly oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. The sinoatrial (SA) node in the RA creates the electrical activity that acts as the heart's natural pacemaker. This electrical impulse then travels to the atrioventricular (AV) node, which lies between the atria and ventricles (Figure 8a). After pausing there briefly, the electrical impulse moves on to the His - Purkinje system, which acts like wiring to conduct the electrical signal into the LV and RV. This electrical signal causes the heart muscle to contract and pump blood.</p>
                        <p>By understanding the normal electrical function of the heart, it will be easy to understand abnormal functions. When blood enters the atria of the heart, an electrical impulse that is sent out from the SA node conducts through the atria resulting in atrial contraction. This atrial contraction registers on an electrocardiogram (ECG) strip as the P wave. This impulse then travels to the AV node, which in turn conducts the electrical impulse through the Bundle of His, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers of the ventricles causing ventricular contraction. The time between the start of atrial contraction and the start of ventricular contraction registers on an ECG strip as the PR interval. The ventricular contraction registers on the ECG strip as the QRS complex. Following ventricular contraction, the ventricles rest and repolarize, which is registered on the ECG strip as the T wave. The atria also repolarize, but this coincides with the QRS complex, and therefore, cannot be observed on the ECG strip. Together a P wave, QRS complex, and T wave at proper intervals are indicative of normal sinus rhythm (NSR) (Figure 8b, found below). Abnormalities that are in the conduction system can cause delays in the transmission of the electrical impulse and are detected on the ECG. These deviations from normal conduction can result in dysrhythmias such as heart blocks, pauses, tachycardias and bradycardias, blocks, and dropped beats. These rhythm disturbances will be covered in more detail further in the handbook.</p>

                        <h4>AIRWAY</h4>
                        <p>Monitor and maintain an open airway at all times. The provider must decide if the benefit of adding an advanced airway outweighs the risk of pausing CPR. If the individual's chest is rising without using an advanced airway, continue giving CPR without pausing. However, if you are in a hospital or near trained professionals who can efficiently insert and use the airway, consider pausing CPR for a maximum of 10 seconds.</p>

                        <h4>BREATHING</h4>
                        <p>In cardiac arrest, administer 100% oxygen. Keep blood O<sub>2</sub> saturation (sats) greater than or equal to 94 percent as measured by a pulse oximeter. Use quantitative waveform capnography when possible. Normal partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> is between 35 to 40 mmHg. High-quality CPR should produce an ETCO2 between 10 to 20 mmHg. If the ETCO2 reading is less than 10 mmHg, confirm the quality of CPR and placement of advanced airway. If still less than 10 mmHg after 20 minutes of CPR for an intubated individual, then you may consider stopping resuscitation attempts.</p>

                        <h4>CIRCULATION</h4>
                        <p>Obtain intravenous (IV) access when possible. However, if after two unsuccessful attempts, go straight to intraosseous access (IO). Monitor blood pressure with a blood pressure cuff or intraarterial line if available. Monitor the heart rhythm using pads and a cardiac monitor. When using an AED, follow the directions (i.e., shock a shockable rhythm). Give fluids when appropriate. Use cardiovascular medications when indicated.</p>

                        <h4>DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h4>
                        <p>Start with the most likely cause of the arrest and then assess for less likely causes. Treat reversible causes and continue CPR as you create a differential diagnosis. Stop only briefly to confirm a diagnosis or to treat reversible causes. Minimizing interruptions in perfusion is key.</p>

                        <p>If bag-mask ventilation is adequate, providers may defer insertion of an advanced airway. Health care providers should make the decision as to the appropriateness of placing an advanced airway during the ACLS Survey. The value of securing the airway must be balanced against the need to minimize the interruption in perfusion that results in halting compressions during airway placement.</p>
                        <p>Basic airway equipment includes the oropharyngeal airway (OPA) and the nasopharyngeal airway (NPA). The primary difference between an OPA and a NPA is that an OPA is placed in the mouth while an NPA is inserted through the nose. Both airway equipment terminate in the pharynx. The main advantage of an NPA over an OPA is that it can be used in either conscious or unconscious individuals because the device does not stimulate the gag reflex.</p>
                        <p>Advanced airway equipment includes the laryngeal mask airway, laryngeal tube, esophageal-tracheal tube, and endotracheal tube. Different styles of these supraglottic airways are available. If it is within your scope of practice, you may use advanced airway equipment when appropriate and available.</p>

                        <h4>OROPHARYNGEAL AIRWAY (OPA)</h4>
                        <p>The OPA is a J-shaped device that fits over the tongue to hold the soft hypopharyngeal structures and the tongue away from the posterior wall of the pharynx. OPA is used in individuals who are at risk for developing airway obstruction from the tongue or from relaxed upper airway muscle. A properly sized and inserted OPA results in proper alignment with the glottis opening. If efforts to open the airway fail to provide and maintain a clear, unobstructed airway, then use the OPA in unconscious victims. An OPA should not be used in a conscious or semiconscious individual, because it can stimulate gagging, vomiting, and possible aspiration. The key assessment to determine if an OPA can be placed is to check if the individual has an intact cough and gag reflex. If so, do not use an OPA.</p>
                        
                        <h4>NASOPHARYNGEAL AIRWAY (NPA)</h4>
                        <p>The NPA is a soft rubber or plastic uncuffed tube that provides a conduit for airflow between the nares and the pharynx. It is used as an alternative to an OPA in individuals who need a basic airway management adjunct. Unlike the oral airway, NPAs may be used in conscious or semiconscious individuals (individuals with intact cough and gag reflex). The NPA is indicated when insertion of an OPA is technically difficult or dangerous. NPA placement can be facilitated by the use of a lubricant. Never force placement of the NPA as severe nosebleeds may occur. If it does not fit in one nare, try the other side. Use caution or avoid placing NPAs in individuals with obvious facial fractures.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Only use an OPA in unresponsive individuals with NO cough or gag reflex. Otherwise, an OPA may stimulate vomiting, laryngeal spasm, or aspiration.</li>
                                <li>An NPA can be used in conscious individuals with intact cough and gag reflex. However, use carefully in individuals with facial trauma due to the risk of displacement.</li>
                                <li>Keep in mind that the individual is not receiving 100% oxygen while suctioning. Interrupt suctioning and administer oxygen if any deterioration in clinical picture is observed during suctioning.</li>

                        </aside>

                        <h4>SUCTIONING</h4>
                        <p>Suctioning is an essential component of maintaining a patent airway. Providers should suction the airway immediately if there are copious secretions, blood, or vomit. Attempts at suctioning should not exceed 10 seconds. To avoid hypoxemia, follow suctioning attempts with a short period of 100% oxygen administration. Monitor the individual's heart rate, oxygen saturation, and clinical appearance during suctioning. If a change in monitoring parameters is seen, interrupt suctioning and administer oxygen until the heart rate returns to normal and until clinical condition improves. Assist ventilation as warranted.</p>

                        <h4>INSERTING AN OPA</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Clear the mouth of blood and secretions with suction if possible.</li>
                            <li>Select an airway device that is the correct size for the person.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Too large of an airway device can damage the throat.</li>
                                    <li>Too small of an airway device can press the tongue into the airway.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Place the device at the side of the person's face. Choose the device that extends from the corner of the mouth to the earlobe.</li>
                            <li>Insert the device into the mouth so the point is toward the roof of the mouth or parallel to the teeth.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Do not press the tongue back into the throat.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Once the device is almost fully inserted, turn it until the tongue is cupped by the interior curve of the device.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4>INSERTING AN NPA</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Select an airway device that is the correct size for the person.</li>
                            <li>Place the device at the side of the person's face. Choose the device that extends from the tip of the nose to the earlobe. Use the largest diameter device that will fit.</li>
                            <li>Lubricate the airway with a water-soluble lubricant or anesthetic jelly.</li>
                            <li>Insert the device slowly, moving straight into the face (not toward the brain).</li>
                            <li>It should feel snug; do not force the device into the nostril. If it feels stuck, remove it and try the other nostril.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>TIPS ON SUCTIONING</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>OPAs too large or too small may obstruct the airway.</li>
                            <li>NPAs sized incorrectly may enter the esophagus.</li>
                            <li>Always check for spontaneous respirations after insertion of either device.</li>
                            <li>When suctioning the oropharynx, do not insert the catheter too deeply. Extend the catheter to the maximum safe depth and suction as you withdraw.</li>
                            <li>When suctioning an endotracheal (ET) tube, keep in mind the tube is within the trachea and that you may be suctioning near the bronchi or lung. Therefore, sterile technique should be used.</li>
                            <li>Each suction attempt should be for no longer than 10 seconds. Remember the person will not get oxygen during suctioning.</li>
                            <li>Ideally, hyper oxygenate before any suction attempts to eliminate that oxygen loss.</li>
                            <li>Monitor vital signs during suctioning and stop suctioning immediately if the person experiences hypoxemia (oxygen sats less than 94%), has a new arrhythmia or becomes cyanotic.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">ADVANCED AIRWAY ADJUNCTS</h3>
                        <h4>ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE</h4>
                        <p>The endotracheal (ET) tube is an advanced airway alternative. It is a specific type of tracheal tube that is inserted through the mouth or nose. It is the most technically difficult airway to place; however, it is the most secure airway available. Only experienced providers should perform ET intubation. This technique requires the use of a laryngoscope. Fiber optic portable laryngoscopes have a video screen, improve success, and are gaining popularity for field use.</p>
                        
                        <h4>LARYNGEAL MASK AIRWAY</h4>
                        <p>The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is an advanced airway alternative to ET intubation and provides comparable ventilation. It is acceptable to use the LMA as an alternative to an esophageal-tracheal tube for airway management in cardiac arrest. Experience will allow rapid placement of the LMA device by an ACLS provider.</p>
                        
                        <h4>LARYNGEAL TUBE</h4>
                        <p>The advantages of the laryngeal tube are similar to those of the esophageal-tracheal tube; however, the laryngeal tube is more compact and less complicated to insert. This tube has only one larger balloon to inflate and can be inserted blindly.</p>
                        
                        <h4>ESOPHAGEAL-TRACHEAL TUBE</h4>

                                <li>During CPR, the chest compression to ventilation rate for adults is 30:2.</li>
                                <li>If an advanced airway is placed, do not interrupt chest compressions for breaths. Give one breath every 6 seconds with continuous chest compressions.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </aside>
                        <p>The esophageal-tracheal tube (sometimes referred to as a combitube) is an advanced airway alternative to ET intubation. This device provides adequate ventilation comparable to an ET tube. The combitube has two separate balloons that must be inflated and two separate ports. The provider must correctly determine which port to ventilate through to provide adequate oxygenation.</p>

                        <p>Historically in ACLS, providers have administered drugs via the intravenous (IV) or the ET route. ET absorption of drugs is poor, and optimal drug dosing is unknown. Therefore, the intraosseous (IO) route is now preferred when IV access is not available. Below are the priorities for vascular access.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">INTRAVENOUS ROUTE</h3>
                        <p>A peripheral IV is preferred for drug and fluid administration unless central line access is already available. Central line access is not necessary during most resuscitation attempts, as it may cause interruptions in CPR and complications during insertion. Placing a peripheral line does not require CPR interruption.</p>
                        <p>If a drug is given via peripheral route of administration, do the following:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Intravenously push bolus injection (unless otherwise indicated).</li>
                            <li>Flush with 20 mL of fluid or saline.</li>
                            <li>Raise extremity for 10 to 20 seconds to enhance delivery of drug to circulation.</li>
                        </ol>

                             <ul>
                                <li>When using peripheral IV route of administration, drugs can take up to two minutes or more to reach central circulation. The effect of medications given may not be seen until even longer. High-quality CPR helps circulate these drugs and is an important part of resuscitation.</li>
                                <li>Any ACLS drug or fluid that can be administered intravenously can also be given intraosseously.</li>
                                <li>If possible, administer any medication IV or IO early in any two-minute CPR segment.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">INTRAOSSEOUS ROUTE</h3>
                        <p>Drugs and fluids can be delivered safely and effectively during resuscitation via the IO route if IV access is not available. IO access can be used for all age groups, can be placed in less than one minute, and has more predictable absorption than the ET route.</p>

                        <p><strong>1. D:</strong> Atropine is the initial treatment for symptomatic bradycardia. If unresponsive, IV dopamine or epinephrine is the next step. Pacing may be effective if other measures fail to improve the rate.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. B:</strong> Hypomagnesemia or low Mg++ is commonly caused by alcoholism and malnutrition. Administration of IV magnesium may prevent or terminate Torsades de Pointes.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. B:</strong> Adenosine is the correct choice for SVT treatment and commonly results in reactions such as flushing, dyspnea, chest pressure, and lightheadedness.</p>
