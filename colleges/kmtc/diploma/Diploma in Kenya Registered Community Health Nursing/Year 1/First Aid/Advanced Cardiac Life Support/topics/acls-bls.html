                        <p>Approximately every five years the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR), updates the guidelines for CPR and ECC (Emergency Cardiac Care). The content contained herein is based on the most recent ILCOR publications on BLS. Recommendations for adult basic life support (BLS) from the 2020 Guidelines for CPR and ECC include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The importance of early initiation of CPR by lay rescuers has been re-emphasized. The risk of harm to the patient is low if the patient is not in cardiac arrest. Bystanders should not be afraid to start CPR even if they are not sure whether the victim is breathing or in cardiac arrest.</li>
                            <li>A sixth link, Recovery, was added to the Chains of Survival for both Pediatric and Adults.</li>
                            <li>Care of the patient after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) requires close attention to oxygenation, blood pressure control, evaluation for percutaneous coronary intervention, targeted temperature management, and multimodal neuroprognostication.</li>
                            <li>Because recovery from cardiac arrest continues long after the initial hospitalization, patients should have formal assessment and support for their physical, cognitive, and psychosocial needs.</li>
                            <li>After a resuscitation, debriefing for lay rescuers, EMS providers, and hospital-based healthcare workers may be beneficial to support their mental health and well-being.</li>
                            <li>Management of cardiac arrest in pregnancy focuses on maternal resuscitation, with preparation for early perimortem cesarean delivery if necessary to save the infant and improve the chances of successful resuscitation of the mother.</li>

                        <p>BLS for adults focuses on doing several tasks simultaneously. In many situations, more than one person is available to do CPR. This choreographed method includes performing chest compressions, managing the airway, delivering rescue breaths, and using the AED, all as a team. As a team, your primary objective for CPR is to maximize chest compression time and minimize any pauses. By coordinating efforts, a team of rescuers can save valuable seconds when time lost equals damage to the heart and brain.</p>

                        <h4>Be Safe</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If inside, watch for dangers such as construction debris, unsecured weapons, violent individuals, electrical hazards.</li>
                            <li>If outside, watch out for downed electrical wires, leaking fuel from car accidents, building collapse, or natural disaster/dangerous weather conditions. (Drowning persons should be removed from the water and dried off; they should also be removed from standing water, such as puddles, pools, gutters, etc.).</li>
                            <li>Be sure you do not become injured yourself.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Assess the Person</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tap hard on their shoulder and shout "Hey, are you OK?" Yell their name if you know it.</li>
                            <li>Check to see if the person is breathing. (Agonal breathing, which is occasional gasping and is ineffective, does not count as breathing.)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Call EMS</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Send someone for help and to get an AED.</li>
                            <li>If alone, call for help while assessing for breathing and pulse. (The ILCOR emphasizes that cell phones are available everywhere now and most have a built-in speakerphone. Call for help without leaving the person.)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>CPR</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Check pulse simultaneously with checking for breathing. Do not pause more than 10 seconds to check for breathing and pulse.</li>
                            <li>Begin chest compressions and delivering breaths.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Defibrillate</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Turn on the AED upon arrival and attach the pads when directed.</li>
                            <li>Listen and perform the steps as directed.</li>

                        </figure>
                        <h4>CPR Steps for Adults</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Check for the carotid pulse on the side of the neck (Figure 4a). Keep in mind not to waste time trying to feel for a pulse; feel for no more than 10 seconds. If you are not sure you feel a pulse, begin CPR with a cycle of 30 chest compressions and two breaths.</li>
                            <li>Use the heel of one hand on the lower half of the sternum in the middle of the chest (Figure 4b).</li>
                            <li>Put your other hand on top of the first hand (Figure 4b).</li>
                            <li>Straighten your arms and press straight down (Figure 4c). Compressions should be 2 to 2.4" (5 to 6 cm) into the person's chest and at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute.</li>
                            <li>Be sure that between each compression you completely stop pressing on the chest and allow the chest wall to return to its natural position. Leaning or resting on the chest between compressions can keep the heart from refilling in between each compression and make CPR less effective.</li>
                            <li>After 30 compressions, stop compressions and open the airway by tilting the head and lifting the chin (Figure 4d & 4e).
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Put your hand on the person's forehead and tilt the head back.</li>
                                    <li>Lift the person's jaw by placing your index and middle fingers on the lower jaw; lift up.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Give a breath while watching the chest rise. Repeat while giving a second breath. Breaths should be delivered over one second.</li>
                            <li>Resume chest compressions. Switch quickly between compressions and rescue breaths to minimize interruptions in chest compressions.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">TWO-RESCUER BLS/CPR FOR ADULTS</h3>
                        <p>Many times there will be a second person available who can act as a rescuer. The ILCOR emphasizes that cell phones are available everywhere now and most have a built-in speakerphone. Direct the second rescuer to call 911 or your local EMS number without leaving the person while you begin CPR. This second rescuer can also find an AED while you stay with the person. When the second rescuer returns, the CPR tasks can be shared:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The second rescuer prepares the AED for use.</li>
                            <li>You begin chest compressions and count the compressions out loud.</li>
                            <li>The second rescuer applies the AED pads.</li>
                            <li>The second rescuer opens the person's airway and gives rescue breaths.</li>
                            <li>Switch roles after every five cycles of compressions and breaths. One cycle consists of 30 compressions and two breaths for Adults.</li>
                            <li>Be sure that between each compression you completely stop pressing on the chest and allow the chest wall to return to its natural position. Leaning or resting on the chest between compressions can keep the heart from refilling in between each compression and make CPR less effective. Rescuers who become tired may tend to lean on the chest more during compressions; switching roles helps rescuers perform high-quality compressions.</li>
                            <li>Quickly switch between roles to minimize interruptions in delivering chest compressions.</li>
                            <li>When the AED is connected, minimize interruptions of CPR by switching rescuers while the AED analyzes the heart rhythm. If a shock is indicated, minimize interruptions in CPR. Resume CPR as soon as possible with chest compressions.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>Give 30 high-quality chest compressions.</li>
                            <li>Seal the mask against the person's face by placing four fingers of one hand across the top of the mask and the thumb of the other hand along the bottom edge of the mask (Figure 5a).</li>
                            <li>Using the fingers of your hand on the bottom of the mask, open the airway using the head-tilt/chin-lift maneuver. If a cervical injury is suspected, consider alternative methods. (Figure 5b).</li>
                            <li>Press firmly around the edges of the mask and ventilate by delivering a breath over one second as you watch the person's chest rise (Figure 5c).</li>

                        <p>BLS for children and infants also focuses on doing several tasks simultaneously. In many situations, more than one person is available to do CPR. This simultaneous and choreographed method includes performing chest compressions, managing the airway, delivering rescue breaths, and using the AED, all as a team. By coordinating efforts, a team of rescuers can save valuable seconds when time lost equals damage to the heart and brain.</p>

                        <h4>Be Safe</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Move the child out of traffic or any unsafe situation.</li>
                            <li>Move the child out of water and dry the child. (Drowning children should be removed from the water and dried off; they should also be removed from standing water, such as puddles, pools, gutters, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Be sure you do not become injured yourself.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Tap hard on their shoulder and talk to them loudly, saying their name.</li>
                            <li>Check to see if the child is breathing while simultaneously checking their carotid pulse. (Agonal breathing, which is occasional gasping and is ineffective, does not count as breathing.)</li>
                            <li>Keep in mind not to waste time trying to feel for a pulse; feel for at least 5 seconds but no more than 10 seconds. If you are not sure you feel a pulse, begin CPR with a cycle of 30 chest compressions and two breaths.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Call EMS</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Send someone for help and to get an AED.</li>
                            <li>If alone, shout for help while assessing for breathing and pulse. (The ILCOR emphasizes that cell phones are available everywhere now and most have a built-in speakerphone. Call for help without leaving the child.)</li>
                            <li>If no one answers and you do not have a cell phone available, perform 2 minutes of CPR before taking a moment to find help.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Use the heel of one hand on the lower half of the sternum in the middle of the chest.</li>
                            <li>Put your other hand on top of the first hand.</li>
                            <li>Straighten your arms and press straight down. Compressions should be about two inches (5 cm) into the child's chest and at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute.</li>
                            <li>Be sure that between each compression you completely stop pressing on the chest and allow the chest wall to return to its natural position. Leaning or resting on the chest between compressions can keep the heart from refilling in between each compression and make CPR less effective.</li>
                            <li>After 30 compressions, or 15 compressions for two rescuers, stop compressions and open the airway by tilting the head and lifting the chin.

                                    <li>Put your hand on the child's forehead and tilt the head back. Lift the child's jaw by placing your index and middle fingers on the lower jaw; lift up.</li>
                                    <li>If their lips are closed, open the lower lip using your thumb.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Give a breath while watching the chest rise. Repeat while giving a second breath. Breaths should be delivered over one second.</li>
                            <li>Resume chest compressions. Switch quickly between compressions and rescue breaths to minimize interruptions in chest compressions.</li>

                        <h4>ANSWERS</h4>
                        <p><strong>1. C:</strong> ACLS providers are presumed to have mastered BLS skills. CPR is a critical part of resuscitating cardiac arrest victims.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. C:</strong> When responding to an individual who is "down," first determine if they are conscious or not.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. A:</strong> Always assess the safety of the scene in any emergency situation. Do not become injured yourself.</p>
                        <p><strong>4. B:</strong> Most experts recommend a ventilation rate of 10-12 breaths per minute for adults.</p>
                        <p><strong>5. C:</strong> The focus is on early CPR and defibrillation.</p>
                        <p><strong>6. D:</strong> An unresponsive adult without a pulse must receive CPR, and chest compressions should be initiated immediately followed by ventilation.</p>
