                        <p>Successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) requires the use of it as part of a system of care called the Chain of Survival (Figure 14). As with any chain, it is only as strong as its weakest link. Thus, everyone must strive to make sure each link is strong. For instance, community leaders can work to increase awareness of the signs and symptoms of cardiac arrest and make AEDs available in public places. EMS crews must stay abreast of updates and innovations in resuscitation and hone the skills required to deliver CPR quickly and effectively. Hospitals should be ready to receive patients in cardiac arrest and provide excellent care. Critical care and reperfusion centers should be staffed by experts and equipped with the latest technology. Because recovery from cardiac arrest continues long after the initial hospitalization, patients should have formal assessment and support for their physical, cognitive, and psychosocial needs.</p>

                        <p>The ILCOR guidelines for ACLS highlight the importance of effective team dynamics during resuscitation. In the community (outside a health care facility), the first rescuer on the scene may be performing CPR alone. However, a Code Blue in a hospital may bring dozens of responders/providers to a patient's room. It is important to quickly and efficiently organize team members to effectively participate in ACLS. The ILCOR suggests a team structure with each provider assuming a specific role during the resuscitation; this consists of a team leader and several team members. (Table 3)</p>

                        <p>Clear communication between team leaders and team members is essential.</p>
                        <p>It is important to know your own clinical limitations. Resuscitation is the time for implementing acquired skills, not trying new ones. Only take on tasks you can perform successfully. Clearly state when you need help and call for help early in the care of the individual. Resuscitation demands mutual respect, knowledge sharing, constructive criticism, and follow-up discussion (debriefing) after the event.</p>

                        <p>Only about 20% of the individuals who have a cardiac arrest inside a hospital will survive. This statistic prompted the development of a Cardiac Arrest System of Care. Four out of five individuals with cardiopulmonary arrest have changes in vital signs prior to the arrest. Therefore, most individuals who eventually have a cardiac arrest showed signs of impending cardiac arrest. Survival rates could be improved if individuals are identified and treated with ACLS protocols sooner.</p>
                        <p>Originally, specialized groups of responders within a hospital, called Cardiac Arrest Teams, attended to a patient with recognized cardiac arrest. These teams responded to a Code Blue after someone presumably recognized an active cardiac arrest and sought help. Many believed Cardiac Arrest Teams would improve survival rates, but the results were disappointing. Studies show that survival rates were the same in hospitals with Cardiac Arrest Teams as in those without a team. As a result, hospitals are replacing Cardiac Arrest Teams with Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) or Medical Emergency Teams (METs). Anyone can call for the RRT/MET if there is any concern by the patient, a health care provider, or a family member.</p>
                        <p>Rather than waiting for loss of consciousness and full cardiopulmonary arrest, RRTs/METs closely monitor patients in order to treat them before the cardiac arrest occurs. These teams combine the efforts of nurses, physicians, and family members to detect an impending cardiac arrest.</p>

                        <p>When hospitals implement RRTs/METs, there are fewer cardiac arrests, fewer ICU transfers, improved survival rates, and shorter lengths of inpatient stay.</p>
