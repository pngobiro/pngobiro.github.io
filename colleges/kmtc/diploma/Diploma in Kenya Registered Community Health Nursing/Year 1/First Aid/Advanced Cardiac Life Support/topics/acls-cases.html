                        <p>CPR is performed with the individual lying on their back; gravity will cause the jaw, the tongue, and the tissues of the throat to fall back and obstruct the airway. The airway rarely remains open in an unconscious individual without external support.</p>

                        <p>The first step in any airway intervention is to open the airway. This is accomplished by lifting the chin upward while tilting the forehead back (Figure 22). The goal is to create a straighter path from the nose to the trachea.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) and Ventricular fibrillation (VF) are life-threatening cardiac rhythms that result in ineffective ventricular contractions. The ventricular motion of VF is not synchronized with atrial contractions. VT or VTach (Figure 25) is a condition in which the ventricles contract more than 100 times per minute. VF or VFib (Figure 24) is a rapid quivering of the ventricular walls that prevents them from pumping. The emergency condition, pulseless VT, occurs when ventricular contraction is so rapid that there is no time for the heart to refill, resulting in undetectable pulse. In both cases, individuals are not receiving adequate blood flow to the tissues. Despite being different pathological phenomena and having different ECG rhythms, the ACLS management of pulseless VT and VF are essentially the same. Pulseless VT and resuscitation for VF starts with the BLS Survey.</p>
                        <p>An AED reads and analyzes the rhythm and determines if a shock is needed. The AED is programmed to only prompt the user to defibrillate pulseless VT and VF rhythms. The machine does not know if the individual has a pulse or not. This is the primary reason you should not use an AED in someone with a palpable pulse. ACLS responses to pulseless VT and VF within a hospital will likely be conducted using a cardiac monitor and a manual defibrillator. Thus, the ACLS provider must read and analyze the rhythm. Shocks should only be delivered for pulseless VT and VF. Likewise, antiarrhythmic drugs and drugs to support blood pressure may be used.</p>

                        <p>Pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and asystole are related cardiac rhythms in that they are both life-threatening and unshockable cardiac rhythms. Asystole is a flat-line ECG (Figure 27). There may be subtle movement away from baseline (drifting flat-line), but there is no perceptible cardiac electrical activity. Always ensure that a reading of asystole is not a user or technical error. Make sure pads have good contact with the individual, leads are connected, gain is set appropriately, and the power is on. PEA is one of many waveforms by ECG (including sinus rhythm) without a detectable pulse. PEA may include any pulseless waveform with the exception of VF, VT, or asystole (Figure 28).</p>
                        <p>Hypovolemia and hypoxia are the two most common causes of PEA. They are also the most easily reversible and should be at the top of any differential diagnosis.</p>

                        <p>Epinephrine is still the best choice according to 2020 guidelines. Of sixteen observational studies on timing in the recent systematic review, all found an association between earlier epinephrine and ROSC for patients with nonshockable rhythms, although improvements in survival were not universally seen.</p>
                        <p>For patients with shockable rhythm, the literature supports prioritizing defibrillation and CPR initially and giving epinephrine if initial attempts with CPR and defibrillation are not successful.</p>

                        <p>If an individual has a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), start post-cardiac arrest care immediately. The initial BLS/ACLS processes are meant to save an individual's life, while post-cardiac arrest care is meant to optimize ventilation and circulation, preserve heart and brain tissue/function, and to maintain recommended blood glucose levels. Pay close attention to oxygenation, blood pressure control, need for percutaneous coronary intervention, and ideal temperature management. The 2020 ILCOR Guidelines recommend formal assessment and support for an individual's continued physical, cognitive, and psychosocial needs because recovery from a cardiac arrest event continues long after the initial hospitalization. Be sure to remember to address the mental health needs of the First Responders also, and schedule a debriefing for lay rescuers, EMS providers, and hospital-based healthcare workers after a resuscitation event.</p>

                            <li>Obtain early ECG.</li>

                            <li>When blood pressure is very low, consider vasopressors (commonly referred to as "pressors"). Vasopressors and inotropes are medications used to create vasoconstriction or increase cardiac contractility, respectively. Consider using the following:

                                    <li>Dopamine and norepinephrine are the pressors of choice for individuals who are not in cardiac arrest.</li>

                        <p>Targeted temperature management is the only documented intervention that improves/enhances brain recovery after cardiac arrest. Induced targeted temperature management can be performed in unresponsive individuals and should be continued for at least 24 hours. The goal of induced targeted temperature management is to maintain a core body temperature between 89.6 to 96.8 degrees F (32 to 36 degrees C) for at least 24 hours by using a cooling device with a feedback loop. Device manufacturers have developed several innovative technologies that improve the ability to affect and manage targeted temperature management in the post-arrest individual. Targeted temperature management should be induced and monitored by trained professionals. Induced targeted temperature management should not affect the decision to perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), because concurrent PCI and targeted temperature management are reported to be feasible and safe.</p>

                        <p>Bradycardia is defined as a heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute. While any heart rate less than 60 beats per minute is considered bradycardia, not every individual with bradycardia is symptomatic or having a pathological event. Individuals in excellent physical shape often have sinus bradycardia. Symptomatic bradycardia may cause a number of signs and symptoms including low blood pressure, pulmonary edema and congestion, abnormal rhythm, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and/or confusion. Symptomatic bradycardia should be treated with the ACLS Survey. If bradycardia is asymptomatic but occurs with an arrhythmia listed below, obtain a consultation from a cardiologist experienced in treating rhythm disorders.</p>

                        <p>Tachycardia is a heart rate of greater than 100 beats per minute. When the heart beats too quickly, there is a shortened relaxation phase. This causes two main problems: the ventricles are unable to fill completely, causing cardiac output to decrease; and the coronary arteries receive less blood, causing supply to the heart to decrease.</p>

                        <p>Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a collection of clinical presentations including unstable angina, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). ACS is classically recognized by one or more of the following symptoms: crushing chest pain, shortness of breath, pain that radiates to the jaw, arm or shoulder, sweating, and/or nausea or vomiting. It is important to note that not all individuals with ACS will present with these classic findings, particularly women and individuals with diabetes mellitus. It is impossible to determine a specific cardiac event from the ACS symptoms; therefore, ACS symptoms are managed in the same way.</p>
                        <p>Every individual with these symptoms should be evaluated immediately. If an individual appears to be unconscious, begin with the BLS Survey and follow the appropriate pathway for advanced care. If the individual is conscious, proceed with the pathway below.</p>

                        <p>Stroke is a condition in which normal blood flow to the brain is interrupted. Strokes can occur in two variations: ischemic and hemorrhagic. In ischemic stroke, a clot lodges in one of the brain's blood vessels, blocking blood flow through the blood vessel. In hemorrhagic stroke, a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, spilling blood into the brain tissue. Ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke account for 87% and 13% of the total incidents, respectively. In general, the symptoms of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes are similar. However, the treatments are very different.</p>

                        <h4>SYMPTOMS OF STROKE</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Weakness in the arm and leg or face</li>
                            <li>Vision problems</li>
                            <li>Confusion</li>
                            <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
                            <li>Trouble speaking or forming the correct words</li>
                            <li>Problems walking or moving</li>
                            <li>Severe headache (hemorrhagic)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Clinical signs of stroke depend on the region of the brain affected by decreased or blocked blood flow. Signs and symptoms can include: weakness or numbness of the face, arm, or leg, difficulty walking, difficulty with balance, vision loss, slurred or absent speech, facial droop, headache, vomiting, and change in level of consciousness. Not all of these symptoms are present, and the exam findings depend on the cerebral artery affected.</p>
                        <p>The Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS) is used to diagnose the presence of stroke in an individual if any of the following physical findings are seen: facial droop, arm drift, or abnormal speech. Individuals with one of these three findings as a new event have a 72% probability of an ischemic stroke. If all three findings are present, the probability of an acute stroke is more than 85%. Becoming familiar and proficient with the tool FAST utilized by the rescuers' EMS system is recommended. Mock scenarios and practice will facilitate the use of these valuable screening tools.</p>

                        <p>Individuals with ischemic stroke who are not candidates for fibrinolytic therapy should receive aspirin unless contraindicated by true allergy to aspirin. All individuals with confirmed stroke should be admitted to Neurologic Intensive Care Unit if available. Stroke treatment includes blood pressure monitoring and regulation per protocol, seizure precautions, frequent neurological checks, airway support as needed, physical/occupational/speech therapy evaluation, body temperature checks, and blood glucose monitoring. Individuals who received fibrinolytic therapy should be followed for signs of bleeding or hemorrhage. Certain individuals (age 18 to 79 years with mild to moderate stroke) may be able to receive tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) up to 4.5 hours after symptom onset. Under certain circumstances, intra-arterial tPA is possible up to six hours after symptom onset. When the time of symptom onset is unknown, it is considered an automatic exclusion for tPA. If time of symptom onset is known, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has established the time goals below.</p>

                        <h4>ANSWERS</h4>
                        <p><strong>1. C:</strong> CPR is resumed for two minutes before any reassessment is performed. Begin with compression followed by ventilation in a 30:2 ratio for adults.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. B:</strong> The SA node generates electrical impulse in normal cardiac activity. The impulse then travels to the rest of the conduction system and facilitates contraction of the atria and ventricles.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. C:</strong> Normal cardiac electrical impulse travels in a consistent pattern producing normal sinus rhythm.</p>
                        <p><strong>4. A:</strong> The QRS represents ventricular contraction. The T wave represents repolarization of the ventricles.</p>
                        <p><strong>5. B:</strong> Quantitative waveform capnography is the recommended method to assess breathing/ventilation during ACLS. In addition, pulse oximetry should be assessed, and clinical assessment plays a role as well.</p>
                        <p><strong>6. B:</strong> An intraosseous line can be placed rapidly and is the next best route for drug delivery. Absorption after ET tube delivery is unreliable.</p>
                        <p><strong>7. A:</strong> The primary objective of treating sinus tachycardia is to determine the underlying cause. Appropriate treatment decisions can then be made.</p>
                        <p><strong>8. B:</strong> This individual is symptomatic with hypotension and chest pain. Adenosine could be considered if IV access is already in place, while preparation is made for cardioversion. Carotid massage may cause complications in elderly individuals.</p>
                        <p><strong>9. C:</strong> Transcutaneous pacing is indicated for Mobitz Type II second degree AV block, third-degree AV block, and bradycardia with symptomatic ventricular escape rhythm.</p>
                        <p><strong>10. C:</strong> Thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated in large strokes that involve more than one-third of a cerebral hemisphere.</p>
                        <p><strong>11. D:</strong> Eligibility for thrombolytic therapy hinges on the time of onset of symptoms. Current guidelines support administering tPA for eligible individuals with symptom onset of three hours or fewer. Selected individuals may be eligible for up to 4.5 hours from onset.</p>
                        <p><strong>12. True:</strong> Stroke is a neurologic emergency and rapid evaluation and treatment may improve outcomes. The mantra "Time is Brain" should be used here.</p>
