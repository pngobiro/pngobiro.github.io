\section*{Principles and Techniques of Trauma Care}

\section*{OBJECTIVES OF MODULE 1}

Learn basic techniques of triage and emergency care within the first, most critical hour, of a patient's arrival at the hospital

Basic emergency resuscitation skills in adults and children
- open and maintain airway
- perform life-saving procedures
- manage active bleeding
- place intravenous lines
- learn shock management

\section*{SIX PHASES OF TRAUMA CARE MANAGEMENT}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-07.jpg?height=1149&width=2307&top_left_y=465&top_left_x=31)

\section*{MANAGEMENT GOALS}

\section*{Primary survey}
- Examine, diagnose, treat life-threatening injuries as soon as they are diagnosed
- Use simplest treatment possible to stabilize patient's condition

\section*{Secondary survey}
- Perform complete, thorough patient examination to ensure no other injuries are missed

\section*{TRAUMA CARE MANAGEMENT}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-09.jpg?height=556&width=1312&top_left_y=369&top_left_x=522)
- Start resuscitation at the same time as performing primary survey
- Do not start secondary survey until completing primary survey
- Constantly reassess patient for response to treatment; if condition deteriorates, reassess ABC

\section*{TRAUMA CARE MANAGEMENT}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-10.jpg?height=410&width=1323&top_left_y=509&top_left_x=534)
- Do not start definitive treatment until secondary survey is completed unless required as life-saving measure
- When definitive treatment is not available, have a plan for safe transfer of patient to another centre

\section*{MAJOR TRAUMA}

\section*{Trauma mechanism:}
- A fall >3 meters
- Road traffic accident: net speed $>30 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$
- Thrown from or trapped in a vehicle
- Pedestrian or cyclist hit by a car
- Unrestrained occupant of a vehicle
- Injury from high or low velocity weapon

\section*{MAJOR TRAUMA}

\section*{Physical findings:}
- Airway or respiratory distress
- Blood pressure $<100 \mathrm{mmHg}$
- Glasgow Coma Scale <13/15
- Penetrating injury
- More than 1 area injured

Make a full primary and secondary survey of any patient who is injured, especially if major trauma

\section*{PHASE I: TRIAGE}

Triage: sorting and treating patients according to priority; identify, treat patients with life-threatening conditions first

Priority may be determined by:
- Medical necessity
- Personnel skills
- Available equipment

Vital signs
- Pulse rate
- Blood pressure
- Respiratory rate
- $\mathrm{SpO} 2 \%$
- Temperature
- AVPU (Alert, verbal, pain or unresponsive)
- Urine output

\section*{PHASE II: THE PRIMARY SURVEY}

> Airway
> Breathing
> Circulation
> Disability or neurologic Damage
> Expose the patient

Purpose is to identify and treat life threatening injuries:
- Airway obstruction
- Breathing difficulties
- Severe external or internal haemorrhage

\section*{AIRWAY}

\section*{Always assess the airway}
- Talk to the patient
- A patient speaking freely and clearly has an open airway
- Look and listen for signs of obstruction
- Snoring or gurgling
- Stridor or noisy breathing
- Foreign body or vomit in mouth
- If airway obstructed, open airway and clear obstruction

\section*{TECHNIQUES FOR OPENING THE AIRWAY}

No trauma
- Position patient on firm surface
- Tilt the head
- Lift the chin to open the airway
- Remove foreign body if visible
- Clear secretions
- Give oxygen $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-16.jpg?height=1232&width=585&top_left_y=471&top_left_x=1715)

\section*{TECHNIQUES FOR OPENING THE AIRWAY}

In case of trauma
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-17.jpg?height=693&width=1168&top_left_y=551&top_left_x=35)
- Stabilize cervical spine
- Do not lift head!
- Open airway using jaw thrust
- Remove foreign body if visible
- Clear secretions
- Give oxygen $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$

\section*{AIRWAY DEVICES}

\section*{Oropharyngeal airway}
- Use if patient unconscious
- Use correct size - measure from front of ear to corner of mouth
- Slide airway over tongue
- If patient resists, gags or vomits, remove immediately!

\section*{Nasopharyngeal airway}
- Better tolerated if patient is semi-conscious
- Pass well lubricated into one nostril
- Direct posteriorly, towards the throat

\section*{AIRWAY}

Before attempting intubation the answer to these questions should be YES: Is there an indication?
- Failure to maintain or protect the airway (risk of aspiration) or
- Failure to oxygenate or ventilate or
- Impending airway failure (inhalation injury, angioedema)

\section*{Do you have working equipment?}
- Functioning laryngoscope with working light
- Appropriate endotracheal tube size
- Bag-valve mask
- Working oxygen source
- Suction

Do you have a post-intubation plan?
- Is a mechanical ventilator available? (unless only short-term need)
- Are sedative drugs available?

\section*{BREATHING}

Assess ventilation - Is the patient in respiratory distress?

\section*{Look}
- For cyanosis, wounds, deformities, ecchymosis, amplitude, paradoxical movement

\section*{Feel}
- Painful areas, abnormal movement

\section*{Percuss}
- Dullness

\section*{Listen}
- Reduced breath sounds

\section*{INDICATIONS FOR CHEST DECOMPRESSION}

Signs and Symptoms
- Absent or diminished breath sounds on one side
- Evidence of chest trauma or rib fracture
- Open or "sucking" chest wound

Diagnoses
- Pneumothorax
- Tension pneumothorax
- Hemothorax
- Hemo-pnemothorax

\section*{OPEN CHEST WOUND}
-"Sucking" sound
-Requires very prompt treatment
- Apply an occlusive "plastic pack" dressing to wound, tape down on three sides, leaving one side open for air to escape
-Place a chest drain
- Never insert chest tube through wound
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-22.jpg?height=738&width=935&top_left_y=548&top_left_x=1454)
-Give high flow oxygen
-Give antibiotics
-Debride wound and consider closure

\section*{TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX}
- Air from lung puncture enters pleural space, cannot escape
- Progressive increase in intrathoracic pressure causes mediastinal shift and hypotension due to reduced venous return
- Patient becomes short of breath and hypoxic
- Diminished breath sounds on side of pneumothorax
- Requires urgent needle decompression, then chest drain as soon as possible
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-23.jpg?height=1318&width=1038&top_left_y=357&top_left_x=1396)

\section*{TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-24.jpg?height=1143&width=623&top_left_y=417&top_left_x=178)
- Give high flow oxygen
- After aseptic skin preparation
- Insert a large bore needle over rib:
$-2^{\text {nd }}$ intercostal space
- Over $3{ }^{\text {rd }}$ rib at mid-clavicular line
- Listen for hissing sound of air escaping
- Insert chest drain

\section*{INSERTION OF CHEST DRAIN}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-25.jpg?height=553&width=2424&top_left_y=318&top_left_x=35)

Mark incision just above rib in mid-axillary line; use nipple as a landmark so incision not too low (A)
Prepare area with antiseptic; inject local anaesthetic in area of incision down to pleura
Make small transverse incision just above rib to avoid vascular injury; (A, B)
Using a pair of large curved artery forceps, go over top of rib, penetrate pleura bluntly, enlarge opening (C, D)

\section*{Insertion of Chest Drain and Underwater Seal Drainage}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-26.jpg?height=643&width=1491&top_left_y=337&top_left_x=178)

Use same forceps, grasp tube at tip, introduce into chest (E), advancing tube well past holes at end of tube

Close incision with interrupted skin sutures; use one stitch to anchor tube in place (F)
Leave additional stitch untied adjacent to tube for closing wound after tube removal (G)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-26.jpg?height=1130&width=747&top_left_y=341&top_left_x=1712)

Apply gauze dressing
Connect tube to underwater-seal drainage system, mark initial level of fluid in drainage bottle (G)

\section*{CIRCULATION: HAEMORRAGHIC SHOCK}

Assess the circulation
Signs of hypoperfusion
- Confusion, lethargy or agitation
- Pallor or cold extremities
- Weak or absent radial and femoral pulses
- Tachycardia
- Hypotension

Examine the abdomen for tenderness or guarding
Carefully assess pelvic stability

\section*{CIRCULATION: HAEMORRAGHIC SHOCK}

Large volumes of blood may be hidden in thoracic, abdominal and pelvic cavities, or from femoral shaft fractures.

To decrease bleeding:
- Apply pressure to external wounds
- Apply splint to possible femur fracture
- Apply pelvic binder to possible pelvic fracture

If patients is pregnant, she should not be on her back, put her on her left side.
Send blood for type and crossmatch

\section*{CIRCULATION}

Obtain two large bore IV catheters
If systolic BP $<90 \mathrm{mmHg}$ or pulse >110 bpm
- Give 500 ml bolus of Ringer's Lactate or NS
- Keep patient warm
- Reassess vitals
- If still hypotensive after 2L of crystalloids, transfuse blood

\section*{STOP THE BLEEDING}

Apply direct pressure to the wound, then put on compression dressing. Apply only enough pressure to stop the bleeding.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-30.jpg?height=1120&width=2157&top_left_y=545&top_left_x=194)

ONLY if bleeding is life-threatening and cannot be controlled, apply a tourniquet. Use a blood pressure cuff or wide elastic band over padded skin. Transfer urgently!

\section*{DISABILITY or DAMAGE}

Checking for neurological damage: vital part of primary survey Abbreviated neurological examination:
- ALERT
- VERBAL - responsive to verbal stimulus
- PAIN - responsive to painful stimulus
- UNRESPONSIVE

\section*{GLASGOW COMA SCORE (GCS)}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Eyes & Score & Verbal & Score & Motor & Score \\
\hline Open spontaneously & 4 & Oriented & 5 & Obeys commands & 6 \\
\hline Open to command & 3 & Confused talk & 4 & Localizes to pain & 5 \\
\hline Open to pain & 2 & Inappropriate words & 3 & Withdraws to pain & 4 \\
\hline None & 1 & Incomprehensible sounds & 2 & Flexor (decorticate) & 3 \\
\hline & & None & 1 & Extensor (decerebrate) & 2 \\
\hline & & & & None & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Total Score = Eye + Verbal + Motor Scores}

\section*{GLASGOW COMA SCORE}

Eyes + Verbal + Motor Scores = GCS
- Severe head injury: GCS 8 or less
- Moderate head injury: GCS 9-12
- Mild head injury: GCS 13-15

GCS is to be repeated and recorded frequently. It is the best way to determine deterioration

\section*{HEAD INJURY}

\section*{Deterioration}
- Unequal or dilated pupils may indicate increased intracranial pressure
- Avoid sedation or analgesics as it interferes with neurologic examinations, reduces breathing (increased $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ causes increased intracranial pressure)
- Bradycardia, hypertension may indicate worsening condition

\section*{EXPOSURE}
- Remove all patient's clothing
- Examine whole patient
- Front and back; log roll carefully
- Do not allow patient to get cold (especially children)

\section*{IMAGING}

\section*{X-Rays}
- Chest
- Pelvis
- Cervical spine

\section*{Ultrasound}
- FAST scan

\section*{PHASE III: SECONDARY SURVEY}

Head Exam
- Scalp, eyes, ears
- Soft tissues

Neck Exam
- Penetrating injuries
- Swelling or crepitus

Neurological Exam
- Glasgow Coma Score
- Motor examination
- Sensory examination
- Reflexes

Chest Exam
- Clavicles, ribs
- Breath, heart sounds

Abdominal Exam
- Penetrating injury
- Blunt injury: nasogastric tube

\section*{URINARY CATHETER PLACEMENT}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-38.jpg?height=655&width=626&top_left_y=385&top_left_x=111)
1. Wash area with soap and water, retract prepuce
2. Put on sterile gloves, apply bland antiseptic
3. Check integrity of catheter balloon
4. Lubricate catheter generously
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-38.jpg?height=600&width=623&top_left_y=1049&top_left_x=114)
5. Hold penis vertically, slightly stretched
6. Introduce catheter gently-don't force
7. Urine in catheter confirms placement
8. Inflate balloon slowly
9. Replace prepuce

\section*{REASSESSMENT}
- Always perform an ABCDE primary survey if patient deteriorates
- Signs of adequate resuscitation
- Slowing of tachycardia
- Urine output normalizes
- Blood pressure increases

\section*{MONITORING}
- EKG monitoring if available
- Pulse oximeter
- Most widely used physiological monitoring device for heart rate, oxygenation
- Especially useful in anaesthesia, ICU
- Simple to use
- Should be minimum standard of monitoring in every surgical theatre
- Blood pressure
- Manually or automated machine

\section*{Patient Referral and Transport}

\section*{STABILIZATION AND TRANSFER}
- Resuscitation completed
- Analgesia administered
- Laboratory specimen sent
- Fractures immobilized
- Documentation completed
- Transfer
- Ward
- Operating theatre
- Higher level of care centre

\section*{DECISION MAKING}

Can we do procedure here?
- Is operating theatre safe, ready to use?
- Are necessary equipment, drugs, supplies available?
- Are team members available?
- Do I have knowledge and skill to perform necessary procedure safely?
- Is there back-up or extra support available if needed?
- Can we manage potential complications if problems arise?
- Do we have facilities for good post-operative care?

If the answer to any of these questions is "NO" it is inadvisable to proceed with surgery!

\section*{TRANSFER OF TRAUMA PATIENT}

Patient transfer carries inherent risk
Patients must be stabilized prior to departure:
- Effectively resuscitated
- Controlled airway
- Normalized circulation
- Immobilized fractures
- Appropriate analgesia
- Functioning intravenous lines

Patients should be transported only to facilities offering higher level of care

\section*{TRANSFER OF TRAUMA PATIENT}

Planning and preparation:
- Mode of transport
- Accompanying personnel, including family
- Supplies needed for any possible treatment
- Identifying possible complications
- Communicate with all involved in transfer including receiving hospital

Be prepared: if anything can go wrong, it will and at the worst possible time!

\section*{PATIENT SAFETY: Consent}

Informed consent means that patient and patient's family understand
- What is to take place
- Potential risks, complications of both proceeding and not proceeding
- Have given permission for intervention

Be attentive to legal, religious, cultural, linguistic, family norms and differences

Our job is not to judge, but to provide care to all without regard to social status or any other considerations

\section*{PATIENT SAFETY: Consent}

With invasive, surgical procedures important to fully explain :
- What are you proposing to do?
- What are reasons for recommending procedure?
- What are expectations, goals?

Communicate effectively:
- Use language that can be understood
- Draw pictures, use an interpreter if necessary
- Allow patient, family members, elders to ask questions and consider what has been discussed

\section*{RECORD KEEPING}
- Essential that patients receive written note describing diagnosis, procedure performed
- All records should be clear, accurate, complete, signed

\section*{RECORD KEEPING}

Admission note/preoperative note
- Preoperative assessment, management plan, patient consent should be clearly documented

Delivery book
- Chronological list of deliveries, procedures, interventions, complications, outcomes for mother and baby

\section*{RECORD KEEPING}

\section*{Operating theatre records}
- Patient identity
- Procedure performed: both major and minor
- Personnel involved
- Complications
- Blood loss
- Standardized forms save time, encourage staff to record required information

\section*{Postoperative notes}
- All patients assessed at least once after surgery
- Vital signs, patient's condition accurately recorded

\section*{RECORD KEEPING}

\section*{Progress note}
- Need not be long, must comment on patient's condition, note any changes in management plan
- Should be signed by person writing note

\section*{Discharge note}
- Admitting and definitive diagnoses
- Summary of patient's course in hospital
- Outpatient instructions:
- medication details
- planned follow-up
- suture removal, special wound care

\section*{Emergency procedures}

\section*{OXYGEN SUPPLEMENTATION}
- Reliable oxygen supply is essential for anaesthesia or any seriously ill patient
- Oxygen concentrators are the most suitable, economical way to provide oxygen; few cylinders in case of power failure
- Whichever source of oxygen, an effective system is needed for maintenance and repairs
- Clinical staff need training in how to use oxygen safely, effectively, economically

\section*{OXYGEN SUPPLEMENTATION}

\section*{Cylinder System}

\section*{Oxygen Concentrator}
- Inexpensive to buy
- Expensive to operate
- Needs year-round supply of cylinders
- Training and maintenance needed
- Can store oxygen
- More expensive to buy
- Inexpensive to operate
- Requires only electricity
- Training and maintenance needed
- Cannot store oxygen; provides only when power supply is on

\section*{OXYGEN SUPPLEMENTATION}
- Start oxygen at $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$
- If no improvement, increase to:
$-6-10 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ via facemask or
$-10-15 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ via facemask with reservoir
- When improving, titrate down $1-2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, allowing at least 2-3 minutes to evaluate effect.
- Strive to maintain saturation $>90 \%$

\section*{INTRAVENOUS ACCESS}
- Cannula should be placed in arm vein, not over joint, easy fixation. Comfortable and convenient for drug administration and care
- Best veins in emergencies:
- Antecubital fossa
- Femoral
- External jugular
- Do not attempt subclavian vein due to high risk of pleural puncture

\section*{Femoral vein}
- If right handed, stand on patient's right, palpate femoral artery
- Prep area carefully; site is contaminated
- Use a 14,16 or 18 G ( 20 G in child) cannula mounted on 5 ml syringe
- Avoid injured extremities, if possible
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-58.jpg?height=1615&width=738&top_left_y=82&top_left_x=133)

\section*{VENOUS CUTDOWN}
- Equipment
- Small scalpel
- Artery forceps
- Scissors
- Large catheter (or sterile infant feeding tube)
- Transverse incision 2 finger breadths above, anterior to medial malleolus (A); (use patient's own finger breadths to define incision)
- Place two sutures under vein (B)
- Once catheter in place, tie sutures (C)
- Use closing sutures to secure catheter

\section*{FLUIDS AND MEDICINES}
- Avoid fluids containing dextrose during resuscitation
- Use Saline or Ringer's lactate
- For shocked patient: give fluids as fast as drip runs until blood pressure responds
- May need a pressure infusion bag to push fluids
- Monitor response carefully; look at vital signs, urine output
- Always give medicines intravenously during resuscitation

\section*{SURGICAL CRICOTHYROIDOTOMY}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-60.jpg?height=607&width=568&top_left_y=392&top_left_x=440)
- Hyperextend neck, if possible
- Identify groove between cricoid and thyroid cartilages just below "Adam's apple"
- Clean area, infiltrate with local anaesthetic
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-60.jpg?height=603&width=549&top_left_y=389&top_left_x=1540)
- Incise through skin vertically, use blunt dissection to clearly see membrane between thyroid and cricoid
- Using small scalpel, stab through membrane into trachea

\section*{SURGICAL CRICOTHYROIDOTOMY}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-61.jpg?height=638&width=1771&top_left_y=389&top_left_x=433)
- Rotate blade, use curved forceps to widen opening
- Pass thin introducer or nasogastric tube into trachea if small access
- Run \#4-6 size endotracheal tube over introducer, pass into trachea (D)
- Remove introducer, if used

\section*{Trauma in Children}

\section*{TRAUMA IN CHILDREN}
- Trauma is the leading cause of death in all children
- Most common surgical problem affecting children
- Proper treatment can prevent death and life-long disability
- Infants and children differ from adults in significant physiological and anatomical ways
- smaller physiological reserves
- increased risk of:
- dehydration
- hypoglycaemia
- hypothermia

Neutral position to open the airway in an infant

\section*{Child conscious}
- Inspect mouth and remove foreign body, if present
- Clear secretions from throat
- Let child assume position of maximal comfort

\section*{Child unconscious}
- Tilt the head as shown
- Inspect mouth and remove foreign body, if present
- Clear secretions from throat
- Check the airway by looking for chest movements, listening for breath sounds and feeling for breath

\section*{MANAGING THE AIRWAY IN A CHILD WITH SUSPECTED NECK TRAUMA}

NECK TRAUMA OR POSSIBLE CERVICAL SPINE INJURY IS SUSPECTED
- Stabilize the neck
- Inspect mouth and remove foreign body, if present
- Clear secretions from throat
- Check the airway by looking for chest movements, listening for breath sounds, and feeling for breath
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-67.jpg?height=393&width=795&top_left_y=886&top_left_x=446)

Use jaw thrust without head tilt. Place the 4th and 5th finger behind the angle of the jaw and move it upwards so that the bottom of the jaw is thrust forwards, at $90^{\circ}$ to the body
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-67.jpg?height=604&width=738&top_left_y=701&top_left_x=1313)

If the child is still not breathing after carrying out the above, ventilate with bag and mask

\section*{STABILIZE SUSPECTED NECK TRAUMA}

If neck trauma is suspected:
- Stabilize the child's neck and keep the child lying on the back
- Tape the child's forehead to the sides of a firm board to secure this position
- Prevent the neck from moving by supporting the child's head (e.g. using litre bags of IV fluid on each side)
- If vomiting, turn on the side, keeping the head in line with the body

\section*{LOGROLL IN SUSPECTED NECK TRAUMA}
- Avoid rotation, extremes of flexion and extension of neck
- One person should assume responsibility for neck:
- Stand at top of patient and hold head
- Place fingers at edge of mandible with palm over ears
- Maintain gentle traction to keep neck straight and in line with body
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-69.jpg?height=595&width=1369&top_left_y=1045&top_left_x=679)

\section*{BREATHING}
- If child not breathing, ventilate with self-inflating bag and mask
- Connect mask to oxygen if available
- Must have correct size and position of facemask to prevent
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-70.jpg?height=603&width=750&top_left_y=357&top_left_x=1543)

1. Correct size and position
2. Mask too large, overlaps the chin
3. Mask too small, nostrils not covered
4. Mask too large, overlap with eyes

\section*{OROPHARYNGEAL AIRWAYS}
- Can improve airway opening
- Come in different sizes
- Appropriate sized airway goes from centre of teeth (incisors) to angle of

\section*{INSERTION OF OROPHARYNGEAL AIRWAY}
- Select appropriate sized airway
- Position child to open airway
- Use tongue depressor, insert airway
- Convex side up in infant
- Concave side up in older child until tip reaches soft palate, then rotate $180^{\circ}$ and slide back over tongue
- Recheck airway opening, use different size or reposition if necessary

Inserting an oropharyngeal airway in an older child

\section*{HOW TO GIVE OXYGEN}

Give oxygen through nasal prongs or a nasal catheter

\section*{Nasal Prongs}
- Place the prongs just inside the nostrils and secure with tape

\section*{Nasal Catheter}
- Use an 8 FG size tube
- Measure the distance from the side of the nostril to the inner eyebrow margin with the catheter
- Insert the catheter to this depth
- Secure with tape

Start oxygen flow at 1-2 litres/minute

\section*{CIRCULATION}
- The radial pulse at the wrist should be felt.
- If strong and not obviously fast, pulse is adequate
- If radial pulse is difficult to find, try brachial pulse in middle of upper arm

\section*{INTRAVENOUS ACCESS IN CHILDREN}
-Select suitable vein to place 22 or 24
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_29_82acf0133246cfbfd71dg-75.jpg?height=1318&width=1037&top_left_y=376&top_left_x=0)
gauge cannula
-Have assistant keep limb steady, use rubber glove or tubing as tourniquet
-Clean surrounding skin with antiseptic solution
- Introduce cannula into vein and fix securely with tape
-Apply a splint with elbow extended, wrist slightly flexed.

\section*{INTRAOSSEOUS ACCESS}
- Intraosseous puncture provides quick access to circulation in shocked child if venous cannulation impossible
-Fluids, blood, medicines may be given
-Fluids may need to be given under pressure
-If intraosseous needles unavailable, use spinal or bone marrow biopsy needle

\section*{TRAUMA IN CHILDREN}
- Most sensitive indicator of fluid status in a child is urine output
- Infants are unable to concentrate urine as well as adults, thus more susceptible to electrolyte abnormalities
- Dosage calculation (based on weight), for fluids, transfusions, drugs is crucial to correct management

Normal Urine output:
(ml/kg/hour)
Infants $1-2 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h}$
Children $1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h}$
Adults $0.5 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h}$

How much urine would you expect a 20 kg child to produce in 24 hours?

\section*{TRAUMA IN CHILDREN}
- Monitor fluid status, electrolytes, haemoglobin diligently
- Maintenance fluid requirements must be supplemented to compensate for all losses
- Tachycardia is an earlier sign than hypotension
- Events happen quickly in babies; monitor closely

\section*{TRAUMA IN CHILDREN}
- Malnutrition can impair response of children to injury, ability to heal and recover
- Good nutrition promotes healing - poor nutrition prevents it
- Avoid hypothermia. Infants and young children, especially those with little subcutaneous fat, are unable to maintain normal body temperature when there are wide variations in ambient temperature or when anaesthetized

\section*{SHOCK RESUSCITATION PROTOCOL IN CHILDREN}

\begin{tabular}{lc}
\hline Age/weight & \begin{tabular}{c} 
Volume of Ringer's lactate \\
or normal saline solution \\
$\mathbf{( 2 0 ~ m l / k g )}$
\end{tabular} \\
\hline 2 months $(<4 \mathrm{~kg})$ & 75 ml \\
\hline $2-<4$ months $(4-<6 \mathrm{~kg})$ & 100 ml \\
\hline $4-<12$ months $(6-<10 \mathrm{~kg})$ & 150 ml \\
\hline $1-<3$ years $(10-<14 \mathrm{~kg})$ & 250 ml \\
\hline $3-<5$ years $(14-19 \mathrm{~kg})$ & 350 ml \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Reassess child after appropriate volume has run in
Reassess after first infusion: If no improvement, repeat $20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ as rapidly as possible.
Reassess after second infusion: If no improvement, repeat $20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ as rapidly as possible.
Reassess after third infusion: If no improvement, give blood $20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ over 30 minutes (if shock is not caused by profuse diarrhoea, in this case repeat Ringer's lactate or normal saline).

\section*{TRAUMA IN THE ELDERLY}
- Injury risk increases due to slower reflexes, reduced visual acuity, diminished strength
- Even though appearing minor, injuries should be given higher severity scores simply based on age
- Clinician's index of suspicion should be increased
