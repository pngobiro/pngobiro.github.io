                            <li>MUAC is preferred for age 6-59 months.</li>
                            <li>Oedema is used to differentiate two classes of severe acute malnutrition (marasmus and kwashiorkor.)</li>
                            <li>MUAC is a single linear measurement that does not require arithmetic, table lookup or plotting data on growth charts.</li>
                            <li>The colour coded MUAC tapes are simple to use and allow instant classification of nutritional status.</li>
                            <li>Neither MUAC nor WHZ is ideal for predicting mortality; however MUAC appears to show consistently better predictive power.</li>
                            <li>Thus MUAC is the best anthropometric predictor of mortality currently available.</li>

                        <p>N/B The basic physiology of severe acute malnutrition is protein and energy deficiency.</p>
                        <p>This is the core problem but it is often accompanied by other deficiencies such as those of electrolytes, minerals, micronutrients and vitamins.</p>
                        <p>As depicted in the below pie chart</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Apart from the various nutrient deficiencies, the child also has increased risk of developing infections due to an impaired immune response.</p>
                        <p>These children lack subcutaneous fat and therefore they are prone to hypothermia.</p>
                        <p>Changes in liver function, the endocrine system and hypothermia make them prone to hypoglycaemia.</p>
                        <p>Many of these children also have a poor cardiac function that may lead to congestive cardiac failure especially if given intravenous fluid or blood transfusion without caution.</p>
                        <p>At the intestinal level, there is poor motility of the intestine and also poor absorption.</p>
                        <p>They also tend to have high sodium and low potassium levels in the body</p>
                        <p>With all these derangements, a systematic approach is required to make sure that nothing is missed in the identification of problems and in managing them. This is the rationale for the 10 step approach</p>

                        <p>All severely malnourished children are at risk of hypoglycaemia.</p>
                        <p>Blood sugar should be measured immediately but if this is not possible it should be assumed that all children with severe malnutrition have hypoglycaemia.</p>
                        <p>A blood sugar less than $3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$ is hypoglycaemia in a child with SAM.</p>
                        <p>They should be given a feed that is F-75 or 10% glucose or sucrose immediately upon admission. Frequent feeding thereafter is important.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Step 2 -Hypothermia</h3>
                        <p>Hypothermia is very common in malnourished children and often indicates coexisting hypoglycaemia or serious infection.</p>
                        <p>If the axillary temperature is <35°C or does not register on a normal thermometer, assume hypothermia.</p>
                        <p>Where a low-reading thermometer is available, take the rectal temperature. A reading <35.5°C confirms hypothermia.</p>
                        <p>Make sure the child is clothed (including the head), cover with a warmed blanket and place a heater (not pointing directly at the child) or lamp nearby.</p>
                        <p>Alternatively put the child on the mother's bare chest or abdomen (skin-toskin) and cover them with a warmed blanket and/or warm clothing</p>
                        <p>Ensure that the child is covered at all times, especially at night.</p>
                        <p>Keep the head covered, preferably with a warm bonnet to reduce heat loss.</p>
                        <p>Monitor the temperature two hourly.</p>
                        <p>Feed the child 2-hourly, starting immediately after the diagnosis is made.</p>
                        <p>Always give feeds throughout the night and day.</p>
                        <p>Place the bed in a warm, draught-free part of the ward and keep the child covered.</p>
                        <p>Change wet nappies, clothes and bedding to keep the child and the bed dry.</p>
                        <p>Avoid exposing the child to cold (e.g. after bathing, or during medical examinations).</p>
                        <p>Let the child sleep with the mother for warmth in the night.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Step 3-Dehydration</h3>
                        <p>It is difficult to estimate dehydration status accurately in the severely malnourished child using clinical signs alone.</p>
                        <p>Assume that all children with watery diarrhoea may have some dehydration.</p>
                        <p>Severely impaired circulation (Shock) is diagnosed in these children using the same core signs as in those without malnutrition:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reduced level of consciousness,</li>
                            <li>Absent or weak (low volume) peripheral.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Severely impaired circulation (Shock) is treated with special fluid plans using Ringer's lactate solution (Hartmann's solution).</p>
                        <p>Administer the fluid as a slow bolus at a rate of <strong>20mls/kg</strong> given over two hours.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the two hour, continue with oral (or NG) fluids.</p>
                        <p>Repeat boluses are not recommended even if the child still has features of severely impaired circulation.</p>
                        <p>Give ReSoMal (rehydration solution for malnutrition) at $10 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ hour per oral or using NG for the first two hours.</p>
                        <p>Then give fluids at $5-10 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$.hr for the next $4-10$ hours; alternate the ReSoMal with same volume of F75.</p>
                        <p>The volume to give will depend on how much the child wants, volume of stools and whether child is vomiting. The Basic Paediatric Protocols provides guidance with assumption that you will give ReSoMal at $10 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$.</p>
                        <p>After the rehydration therapy, give F75 at the appropriate volume every 3hours.</p>
                        <p>If the child has severe palmer pallor transfuse $10 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ whole blood over 3 hours as soon as it is available and then continue with appropriate volume of F75 every 3 hours.</p>
                        <p>After the IV fluid bolus for management of severely impaired circulation, if it not possible to give NG fluids (child in un-arousable coma or acute abdomen) give maintenance fluids - Half Strength Darrow's (HSD) in $5 \%$ Dextrose at $100 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day ( $4 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$ ) until it is possible to use NG route.</p>
                        <p>Continue breast feeding throughout. Check the respiratory rate, pulse rate, urine frequency, frequency of stools and vomit.</p>
                        <p>If you find signs of over hydration (increasing respiratory rate by $5 / \mathrm{min}$ and pulse rate by $15 / \mathrm{min}$ ), stop ReSoMal immediately and reassess after 1 hour.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Step 4-Electrolytes</h3>
                        <p>Pre-packaged formulations F75, F100 and RUTF used in SAM contain adequate electrolytes to meet the needs of these children.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Step 5 Infection</h3>
                        <p>Children with SAM often do not develop fever and most times the white cell count is not elevated even when there is confirmed infection.</p>
                        <p>Assume that all children with SAM have an infection on their arrival in hospital and treat with appropriate antibiotics straightaway.</p>
                        <p>All sick children with severe acute malnutrition in hospital should be started on:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Crystalline Penicillin (or Ampicillin) for two days then high dose oral amoxicillin for 5 days.</li>
                            <li>AND IV/IM Gentamicin $7.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ for 7 days.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition they also receive:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nystatin / Clotrimazole for oral thrush,</li>
                            <li>Mebendazole after 7 days treatment. (deworming),</li>
                            <li>Tetracycline eye ointment (+ atropine drops) for pus / ulceration in the eye.</li>

                        <p>To correct micronutrient deficiencies give:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>High dose Vitamin A to children with eye signs: 200,000 iu on admission, on Day 2 and on Day 14 (100,000 iu if aged < 12 months).</li>
                            <li>The pre-packaged F75/F100 had adequate micronutrients, if given at the right dosage, to correct micronutrient deficiencies.</li>
                            <li>These micronutrients include Vitamin A and other vitamins, folic acid, zinc and copper. However, should be prescribed be given if prepackaged F75/100 are not available.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Step 7 Initiate Feeding</h3>
                        <p>Essential features of initial feeding are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Frequent small feeds of low osmolality and low lactose</li>
                            <li>Oral or nasogastric feeds (never parenteral preparations) should be used.</li>
                            <li>Vomiting is NOT a contraindication to feeding. If the child is breastfed, continue with this, but make ensure the prescribed amounts of feeds are given.</li>
                            <li>Feeds are the 'drug' to cure malnutrition; they are a priority (after correction of dehydration if required).</li>
                            <li>The preferred starter formula is called F-75; it provides 75 Kcal and 0.9 grams of protein $/ 100 \mathrm{ml}$. This is a pre-packed formula.</li>
                            <li>If it is not available, you can make F75 from water, skimmed milk, oil and sugar. [Refer to the WHO Pocket Book for Hospital Care of Children for preparation formula]</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>F-75 is used as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>$130 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day in a child without oedema (or has mild/moderate)</li>
                            <li>$100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day in a child with severe oedema.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This starter feed is maintained at this volume until when the child's appetite improves.</p>
                        <p>At this point the child is ready receive F100 or ready to use therapeutic feed (RUFT).</p>
                        <p>The starter feeds should be given 3 hourly ( 8 feeds per day). This means at night too!</p>
                        <p>The very sick children may be feed every 2 hours, if staffing allows, but graduate to 3 hourly feeds as the child improves.</p>
                        <p>During this period that lasts 2-7 days, you should monitor and record the following</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>Weight loss may even occur in children whose oedema is improving so Do not panic!</p>
                        <p>Ensure at least $100 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day of F75 has been given.</p>
                        <p><strong>Changing to F-100 from F-75:</strong> Change to F-100 at same volume as F-75 and maintain that volume for two days while monitoring the child.</p>
                        <p>F-100 has more calories and protein per volume compared with F-75</p>

                        <p>By giving the volume of F-100 as F-75 given in the initial period, the child receives higher energy while the protein and sodium content is more than tripled.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore important to have gradual translation to F-100.</p>
                        <p>On the third day, after changing to $\mathrm{F}-100$, increase each successful feed by 10 ml until some feed remains uneaten.</p>
                        <p>At this point the child should be able to feed using cup (with or without a spoon).</p>
                        <p>A sachet of 92 gm of RUTF provides 500 kcal . The amount of RUTF should provide $200 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day .</p>
                        <p>Unlike F100, RUTF contains iron in addition to other minerals and vitamins and thus it is not necessary to give iron during the recovery phase.</p>
                        <p>Encourage the child to eat as often as possible.</p>
                        <p>A child on RUTF should drink plenty of clean water, from a cup, as the child eats the RUTF.</p>
                        <p>If child still breastfeeding, the child should breastfeed before every RUTF feed.</p>

                        <p>At this point solid food can be introduced slowly, increasing to 5 meals a day.</p>
                        <p>Make sure the caregiver is aware what kinds of foods the child should be taking.</p>
                        <p>Pure maize porridge is inadequate.</p>
                        <p>Let the child feed in between the main meals. Continue breast feeding throughout.</p>
                        <p>One week after admission, if the child is feeding well iron and mebendazole can be introduced.</p>
                        <p>The child should by now be much more lively and interactive (normal!). This should be encouraged ideally by providing toys and an environment in which the child can play.</p>
                        <p>As the child is showing signs of recovery it is also very important to educate the mother about nutritional care of children and begin the process of preparation for discharge.</p>
                        <p>The process of monitoring is crucial during the recovery phase. This includes clinical symptoms and weight.</p>
                        <p>Please remember that feed intake must be monitored throughout.</p>
                        <p>If there is concern for heart failure due to overfeeding (increased pulse rate and respiratory rate),</p>
                        <p>Then you should reduce the feed amount / volumes to $100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ for 24 hours after which it can be increased gradually to $115 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ after 24 hours and to $130 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ after 48 hours.</p>
                        <p>Progress at this stage is measured by weight gain. Calculate and record the weight gain every 3 days as $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day.</p>

                        <p>You should be comfortable to discharge, if the patient has:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Completed antibiotics</li>

                        <p>You should discharge on RUTF and ensure the Mother / carer:</p>
