                        <p>In Kenya, 52 out of every 1000 children born do not live to be five years of age (KDHS 2014)</p>
                        <p>70% of all deaths are attributed to easily preventable and treatable diseases namely;-Acute respiratory infections (mostly Pneumonia),Diarrhoea ,Measles, Malaria ,Malnutrition &Anaemia and HIV</p>
                        <p>Often children succumb to a combination of these conditions-with children presenting in H/Fs with the combined s & s of more than one of these Diseases</p>
                        <p>Evidence has shown that many of these children are not comprehensively assessed ,treated and given appropriate adviceWHO and UNICEF saw the need to improve the care given to children and they developed the IMNCIstrategy.</p>
                        <p>Kenya adopted this strategy in 2000 and it forms a critical part of the KEPH</p>
                        <p>IMNCIcase Mnx approach offers simple and effective methods to comprehensively prevent and manage the leading causes of serious illness and Mortality in children below 5 years</p>
                        <p>With IMNCI,sick children are not only treated for the s & s they present with in the H/F, but are also assessed for other conditions they maybe suffering from</p>

                        <p>Child with any General Danger sign needs URGENT attention: complete assessment , give any pre referral treatment immediately and refer.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1. ASK: IS THE CHILD ABLE TO DRINK OR BREASTFEED?</h4>
                        <p>A child has the sign "not able to drink or breastfeed" if the child is not able to suck or swallow when offered a drink or breastmilk.</p>
                        <p>When you ask the mother if the child is able to drink, make sure that she understands the question. If she says that the child is not able to drink or breastfeed, ask her to describe what happens when she offers the child something to drink. For example, is the child able to take fluid into his mouth and swallow it?</p>
                        <p>If you are not sure about the mother's answer, ask her to offer the child a drink of clean water or breastmilk.</p>
                        <p>Look to see if the child is swallowing the water or breastmilk.</p>
                        <p>A child who is breastfed may have difficulty sucking when his nose is blocked. If the child's nose is blocked, clear it. If the child can breastfeed after the nose is cleared, the child does not have the danger sign, "not able to drink or breastfeed."</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2. ASK: DOES THE CHILD VOMIT EVERYTHING?</h4>
                        <p>A child who is not able to hold anything down at all has the sign "vomits everything."</p>
                        <p>What goes down comes back up. A child who vomits everything will not be able to hold down food, fluids or oral drugs.</p>
                        <p>A child who vomits several times but can hold down some fluids does not have this general danger sign.</p>
                        <p>ask the mother how often the child vomits.</p>
                        <p>Also ask if each time the child swallows food or fluids, does the child vomit? If you are not sure of the mother's answers, ask her to offer the child a drink. See if the child vomits.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3. HAS THE CHILD HAD CONVULSIONS?</h4>
                        <p>During a convulsion, the child's arms and legs stiffen because the muscles are contracting.</p>
                        <p>The child may lose consciousness or not be able to respond to spoken directions.</p>
                        <p>Ask the mother if the child has had convulsions during this current illness.</p>
                        <p>Use words the mother understands. For example, the mother may know convulsions as "fits"or "spasms."</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">4. LOOK TO SEE IF THE CHILD IS LETHARGIC OR UNCONSCIOUS.</h4>
                        <p>A lethargic child is not awake and alert when she should be.</p>
                        <p>The child is drowsy and does not show interest in what is happening around him. Often the lethargic child does not look at his mother or watch your face when you talk.</p>
                        <p>The child may stare blankly and appear not to notice what is going on around him.</p>
                        <p>An unconscious child cannot be wakened. He does not respond when he is touched, shaken or spoken to.</p>
                        <p>Ask the mother if the child seems unusually sleepy or if she cannot wake the child.</p>
                        <p>Look to see if the child wakens when the mother talks or shakes the child or when you clap your hands.</p>
                        <p>Child with any General Danger sign needs URGENT attention: complete assessment, give any pre referral treatment immediately and refer.</p>

                        <p>The health worker attending to a sick child MUST ask about all the four main symptoms below.</p>

                        <p>If the child does not have cough or difficult breathing, ask about the next main symptom, diarrhoea. Do not assess the child further for signs related to cough or difficult breathing.</p>
                        <p>If the mother answers YES, ask the next question</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">ASK: FOR HOW LONG?</h3>
                        <p>A child who has had cough or difficult breathing for more than 30 days has a chronic cough. This may be a sign of tuberculosis, asthma, whooping cough or another problem. COUNT THE BREATHS IN ONE MINUTE</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the child is : 2 months up to 12 months</li>
                            <li>The child has fast breathing: 50 breaths per minute or more</li>
                            <li>12 months up to 5 years: 40 breaths per minute or more</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note: The child who is exactly 12 months old has fast breathing if you count 40 breaths per minute or more.</p>
                        <p>Before you look for the next two signs-chest indrawing and stridor-watch the child to determine when the child is breathing IN and when the child is breathing OUT.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">LOOK FOR CHEST INDRAWING</h3>
                        <p>If you did not lift the child's shirt when you counted the child's breaths, ask the mother to lift it now.</p>
                        <p>Look for chest indrawing when the child breathes IN. Look at the lower chest wall (lower ribs).</p>
                        <p>When chest indrawing is present,the lower chest wall goes IN when the child breathes IN.</p>
                        <p>If you only see chest indrawing when the child is crying or feeding, the child does not have chest indrawing.</p>
                        <p>If only the soft tissue between the ribs goes in when the child breathes in (also called intercostal indrawing or intercostal retractions), the child does not have chest indrawing.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">LOOK AND LISTEN FOR STRIDOR</h3>
                        <p>Stridor is a harsh noise made when the child breathes in. A child who has stridor when calm has a dangerous condition. To look and listen for stridor, look to see when the child breathes IN.</p>
                        <p>Then listen for stridor. Put your ear near the child's mouth because stridor can be difficult to hear.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes you will hear a wet noise if the child's nose is blocked. Clear the nose, and listen again.</p>
                        <p>A child who is not very ill may have stridor only when he is crying or upset.</p>
                        <p>Be sure to look and listen for stridor when the child is calm.</p>
                        <p>You may hear a wheezing noise when the child breathes OUT. This is not stridor.</p>

                            <li>Look at the child's general condition; is the child lethargic or unconscious? Is the child restless and irritable? A child who is lethargic or unconscious has a general danger sign.</li>
                            <li>Look for sunken eyes then ask the mother if she thinks her child's eyes are unusual. A child with malnutrition and is visibly wasted has eyes that always look sunken even if the child is not dehydrated. Use the sign to classify the child's dehydration.</li>
                            <li>Offer child fluid; is the child not able to drink or drinking poorly? Drinking eagerly, thirsty?</li>
                            <li>Pinch the skin of the abdomen; locate the area on the abdomen halfway between the umbilicus and the side of abdomen and pinch the skin using thumb and first finger. Does it go back very slowly (longer than 2 seconds)? Slowly? Immediately? In a child with marasmus the skin may go back slowly even if the child is not dehydrated. In an overweight child or a child with oedema, the skin may go back immediately even if the child is dehydrated. Even though skin pinch is less reliable in these children, still use it to classify the child'sdehydration</li>

                            <li>Rana is 14 months old. She weighs 12 kg . Her temperature is $37.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Rana's mother said the child has had diarrhoea for 3 weeks. Rana does not have any general danger signs. She does not have cough or difficult breathing. The health worker assessed her diarrhoea. He noted she has had diarrhoea for 21 days. He asked if there has been blood in the child's stool. The mother said, "No." The health worker checked Rana for signs of dehydration. The child is irritable throughout the visit.

                        <p><strong>2. Malaria</strong></p>
                        <p>To classify and treat children with fever, you must know the malaria risk in your area.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is a <strong>high malaria risk</strong> in areas where more than 5% of the fever cases in children are due to malaria.</li>
                            <li>There is a <strong>low malaria risk</strong> in areas where 5% or less of the fever cases in children are due to malaria.</li>
                            <li>There is <strong>no malaria risk</strong> in areas where no transmission of malaria occurs.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>LOOK FOR MOUTH ULCERS. ARE THEY DEEP AND EXTENSIVE?</strong></p>
                        <p>Look inside the child's mouth for mouth ulcers. Ulcers are painful open sores on the inside of the mouth and lips or the tongue.</p>
                        <p>They may be red or have white coating on them. In severe cases, they are deep and extensive. When present, mouth ulcers make it difficult for the child with measles to drink or eat.</p>
                        <p><strong>LOOK FOR PUS DRAINING FROM THE EYE</strong></p>
                        <p>Pus draining from the eye is a sign of conjunctivitis. Conjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva, the inside surface of the eyelid and the white part of the eye. If you do not see pus draining from the eye, look for pus on the conjunctiva or on the eyelids</p>
                        <p><strong>LOOK FOR CLOUDING OF THE CORNEA</strong></p>
                        <p>The cornea may appear clouded or hazy, such as how a glass of water looks when you add a small amount of milk.</p>

                        <p>Atika is 5 months old. She weighs 5 kg . Her temperature is $36.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The risk of Malaria is high. Her family brought her to the clinic because she feels hot and has had cough for 2 days.</p>
                        <p>She is able to drink. She has not vomited or had convulsions, and is not lethargic or unconscious.</p>
                        <p>The health worker said, "I am going to check her cough now." The health worker counted 43 breaths per minute. There was no chest indrawing and no stridor when Atika was calm. Atika did not have diarrhea.</p>
                        <p>"Now, I will check her fever," said the health worker. Atika lives in an area where many cases of malaria occur all year long (high malaria risk). Her mother said, "Atika has felt hot off and on for 2 days." She has not had measles within the last 3 months. She does not have stiff neck or runny nose.</p>
                        <p>Atika has a generalized rash. Her eyes are red. She has mouth ulcers. They are not deep and extensive. She does not have pus draining from the eye. She does not have clouding of the cornea.</p>
                        <p>Record the child's signs and classify them on the Recording Form on this page.</p>
