WOUNDS
ROTICH KEVIN

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
- Wound Is a physical injury compromising the normal integrity of skin. It may involve the underlying structures i.e. tendons, muscle, bone etc.
- Acute Wound: Disruptions to the integrity of the skin +/- the underlying tissues that progresses to heal continuously/timely through the normal phases of healing. (Hemostasis, Defensive/Inflammatory. Proliferative, Maturation.)
- Chronic wound: Disruptions in the skin which does not progress to heal normally. The process of healing mostly stagnates at inflammatory phase

\section*{CONT...}
- The term soft tissues refers to those parts which are not bone or cartilage.
- From the point of view of injuries, it is necessary to consider the skin, muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels and nerves.
- It is vital to consider not only what structures have been damaged, but also how the damage has come about, known as the mechanism of injury .

\section*{Mechanism of injury}
- Injuries may be either blunt or penetrating.
- They may occur by external insult, such as a cut by a knife, or indirectly, such as a nerve damaged by the sharp end of a bone.
- The amount of energy imparted to the soft tissues is proportional to the degree of violence applied

\section*{Wound closure}
- Primary-Edges of the wound can be approximated and bound together i.e. through stapling, suturing, gluing or taping. Healing occur by primary intention.
- Secondary -Wound is allowed to granulate \& re-epithelialize. Healing occurs by secondary intention.
- Delayed primary closure- Mostly done when an already existing open wound is closed similarly to primary wound closure. Debridement has to be done prior.

\section*{Phases of wound healing}
- Primarily, the body has the capability of healing the wound on its own. At times, internal and external factors can cause stagnation or retrogress. It is the responsibility of the practitioner to make the healing environment conducive to facilitate quick healing and establish good skin integrity.
- The stages of wound healing are a complex and fragile process. Failure to progress in the stages of wound healing can lead to chronic wounds.
- Factors that lead up to chronic wounds are venous disease, infection, diabetes and metabolic deficiencies of the elderly. Advanced wound care can speed up the stages whereby a moist option for dressing are considered, protection from re-injury and infection

\section*{Cont..}

There are 4 phases of wound healing:
i. Hemostasis
ii. Defensive/Inflammatory.
iii. Proliferative,
iv. Maturation.

\section*{Hemostatic phase}
- This is the process of the wound being closed by clotting. Hemostasis starts when blood leaks out of the body. The first step of hemostasis is when blood vessels constrict to restrict the blood flow. Next, platelets stick together in order to seal the break in the wall of the blood vessel. Finally, coagulation occurs and reinforces the platelet plug with threads of fibrin which are like a molecular binding agent.
- The hemostasis stage of wound healing happens very quickly. The platelets adhere to the sub-endothelium surface within seconds of the rupture of a blood vessel's epithelial wall. After that, the first fibrin strands begin to adhere in about sixty seconds. As the fibrin mesh begins, the blood is transformed from liquid to gel through pro-coagulants and the release of prothrombin.
- The formation of a thrombus or clot keeps the platelets and blood cells trapped in the wound area. The thrombus is generally important in the stages of wound healing but becomes a problem if it detaches from the vessel wall and goes through the circulatory system, possibly causing a CVA, pulmonary embolism or Cardiac arrest.

\section*{Inflammatory phase}
- Inflammation is the second stage of wound healing and begins right after the injury when the injured blood vessels leak transudate (made of water, salt, and protein) causing localized swelling.
- Inflammation both controls bleeding and prevents infection. The fluid engorgement allows healing and repair cells to move to the site of the wound.
- During the inflammatory phase, damaged cells, pathogens, and bacteria are removed from the wound area. These white blood cells, growth factors, nutrients and enzymes create the swelling, heat, pain and redness commonly seen during this stage of wound healing.
- Inflammation is a natural part of the wound healing process and only problematic if prolonged or excessive.

\section*{Proliferative phase}
- The proliferative phase of wound healing is when the wound is rebuilt with new tissue made up of collagen and extracellular matrix.
- In the proliferative phase, the wound contracts as new tissues are built. In addition, a new network of blood vessels must be constructed so that the granulation tissue can be healthy and receive sufficient oxygen and nutrients.
- Myofibroblasts cause the wound to contract by gripping the wound edges and pulling them together using a mechanism similar to that of smooth muscle cells. In healthy stages of wound healing, granulation tissue is pink or red and uneven in texture.
- Moreover, healthy granulation tissue does not bleed easily. Dark granulation tissue can be a sign of infection, ischemia, or poor perfusion. In the final phase of the proliferative stage of wound healing, epithelial cells resurface the injury. It is important to remember that epithelialization happens faster when wounds are kept moist and hydrated.
- Generally, when occlusive or semi occlusive dressings are applied within 48 hours after injury, they will maintain correct tissue humidity to optimize epithelialization.

\section*{Maturation phase}
- Also called the remodeling stage of wound healing, the maturation phase is when collagen is remodeled from type III to type I and the wound fully closes. The cells that had been used to repair the wound but which are no longer needed are removed by apoptosis, or programmed cell death.
- When collagen is laid down during the proliferative phase, it is disorganized and the wound is thick. During the maturation phase, collagen is aligned along tension lines and water is reabsorbed so the collagen fibers can lie closer together and cross-link. Cross-linking of collagen reduces scar thickness and also makes the skin area of the wound stronger.
- Generally, remodeling begins about 21 days after an injury and can continue for a year or more. Even with cross-linking, healed wound areas continue to be weaker than uninjured skin, generally only having 80\% of the tensile strength of unwounded skin.

\section*{Factors affecting wound healing}
1. Age
- Aging affects everything in the body, including the structure and function of the skin. Everything slows down during the aging process, including the phases of wound healing. Functional changes in the skin include thinning of the skin and a decreased inflammatory response. Thinning of the skin predisposes the elderly to injuries and fragility. There are a few physical findings in the elderly that affect their ability to heal normally within the layers of the skin:
- Epidermis
$\checkmark$ Decreased thickness in the epidermal layer that causes increased transparency and fragility
$\checkmark$ A decrease in cell replacements means a delay in wound healing
$\checkmark$ Reduced number of Langerhans cells
$\checkmark$ Change in the shapes and sizes of the keratinocytes
- Dermis
$\checkmark$ Dry skin brought on by a decrease in dermal blood flow
$\checkmark$ Decreased dermal thickness, which causes a paper-thin, transparent appearance, increasing the risk of pressure ulcers

\section*{cont....}

\section*{2. Nutrition}
- It is vital that the patient has proper nutrition to promote healing. The wound is unable to heal properly if the patient lacks the necessary nutrients to maintain adequate energy for collagen synthesis.
3. Obesity
- A patient who weighs 20 percent more than his or her ideal body weight has a higher risk of infection leading to an interruption of the healing process.
4. Presence of debris, necrotic tissue, and infection

Foreign bodies prevents tissue cohesion and prolong the inflammation process leading to increased exudate and susceptibility to infection. Collagen lysis can occur when an infection is present. This further delays healing and can lead to Tissue death..

\section*{cont....}

\section*{5. Repeated trauma}
- Injuries subjected to existing wounds retrogresses the healing wound either by increasing the wounds surface area or destroying the granulating/epithelializing cells. Injuries and/or open wounds on previous scars heal slowly and poorly due to reduced cellular activities due to rigidity and compromise of the skin structure caused by the scar tissue.

\section*{6. Skin and moisture}

Skin must have an adequate amount of fluid to ensure proper functioning and viability of the tissue. Alteration in moisture predisposes the patient to further skin breakdown, infection and maceration. The formation of eschar commonly associated with pressure ulcers is brought on in severe cases when dehydration induced by the death of the underlying dermal structures occurs.

\section*{Cont..}

\section*{7. Systemic causes}
- Common systemic disorders include diabetes mellitus, malnourishment, and immunodeficiency. Diabetes mellitus plays an enormous role in the healing process of wounds. It predisposes patients to wounds due to diminished sensation and poor arterial flow, compromised immunity and susceptibility to tissue breakdown. There are countless medications and other diseases that compromise the healing of wounds, and many of the medications such as prolonged steroid use leads to thinning skin.

\section*{8. Tissue hypoxia}
- The most common causes of tissue hypoxia are related to arterial occlusions or vasoconstrictors, hypotension, hypothermia and peripheral venous congestion. Limited oxygen supply to the wound prevents collagen production. When the patient lacks the proper amount of oxygen in the bloodstream, the patient will endure vasoconstriction. Smoking also leads to tissue hypoxia.

\section*{9. Dry skin}
- Patients who are prone to dry skin, especially the elderly are at risk for skin lesions, excoriations, infection, and thickening due to scratching and rubbing the skin. This leads to reduced cellular regeneration.

\section*{Cont..}

\section*{10. Wound Infection}
- Due to the injury process, all wounds are contaminated with bacteria. However, the patient's immune competence and the size of the bacterial inoculum determine whether the wound will become infected. If the patient has normal host defenses, the wound will heal effectively. Bacteria/viral load increase the inflammatory period, prolonging the phase.

\section*{WOUND INFECTION}

\section*{Anatomy}
- Two additional features of skin anatomy that affect the repair of injuries are cleavage lines and wrinkles.
- Lines of cleavage are also known as Langer's lines.
- These lines are formed by the collagen bundles that lie parallel in the dermis.
- An incision or repair along these lines lessens disruption of collagen bundles and decreases new collagen formation and therefore causes less scarring.
- Wrinkle lines are not always consistent with Langer's lines.
- If a laceration is not in an area of apparent wrinkling, following the basic outline of Langer's lines results in the best repair.

\section*{Definition}
- A wound is a breach (damage) in a normal tissue (May be superficial or deep) resulting accidentally or of planned surgery.
- Wound healing is the summation of a number of processes which follow injury including coagulation, inflammation, matrix synthesis and deposition, angiogenesis, fibroplasia, epithelialisation, contraction, remodelling and scar maturation
- Where wound edges are apposed healing proceeds rapidly to closure; this is known as healing by first intention or primary healing
- Where the wound edges are apart, such as when there has been tissue loss, the same biological processes occur, but rapid closure is not possible.
- Angiogenesis and fibroblast proliferation result in the formation of granulation tissue.
- In human regeneration is limited to epithelium and the liver; most tissues heal by repair resulting in scarring.
- This contract to reduce wound area and allows epithelialisation across its surface to achieve wound closure.
- This is known as healing by second intention
- This process is slower, the contraction involved may cause contracture and functional restriction, and the resultant healed surface is a thin layer of epithelium on scar tissue that may not prove durable in the long term.
- In general, healing by second intention will give a worse aesthetic outcome.
- It is because of the poor functional and aesthetic results of healing by second intention that surgical endeavour is usually directed towards achieving primary wound healing.

\section*{Epidemiology}
- A survey sponsored by the World Health Organization demonstrated a prevalence of nosocomial infections varying from $3-21 \%$, with wound infections accounting for $5-34 \%$ of the total.

\section*{Etiology}
- All surgical wounds are contaminated by microbes, but in most cases, infection does not develop because innate host defenses are quite efficient in the elimination of contaminants.
- A complex interplay between host, microbial, and surgical factors ultimately determines the prevention or establishment of a wound infection.

\section*{Microbiology:}
- Microbial factors that influence the establishment of a wound infection are the bacterial inoculum, virulence, and the effect of the microenvironment.
- When these microbial factors are conducive, impaired host defenses set the stage for enacting the chain of events that produce wound infection
- Most Surgical site infections (SSIs) are contaminated by the patient's own endogenous flora, which are present on the skin, mucous membranes, or hollow viscera
- The usual pathogens on skin and mucosal surfaces are gram-positive cocci (notably staphylococci); however, gram-negative aerobes and anaerobic bacteria contaminate skin in the groin/perineal areas.
- The contaminating pathogens in gastrointestinal surgery are the multitude of intrinsic bowel flora, which include gram-negative bacilli (e.g. Escherichia coli) and gram-positive microbes, including enterococci and anaerobic organisms
- Gram-positive organisms, particularly staphylococci and streptococci, account for most exogenous flora involved in SSIs.
- Sources of such pathogens include surgical/hospital personnel and intraoperative circumstances, including surgical instruments, articles brought into the operative field, and the operating room air
- The most common group of bacteria responsible for SSIs are Staphylococcus aureus.

\section*{Host Systemic factors:}
- Advanced age
- Malnutrition
- Hypovolemia
- Poor tissue perfusion
- Obesity
- Diabetes
- Steroids and other immunosuppressants
- Smoking
- Alcoholism
- Chronic renal failure
- Poor physical condition
- Previous radiotherapy

\section*{Wound characteristics:}
- Nonviable tissue in wound
- Hematoma
- Foreign material, including drains and sutures
- Dead space
- Poor skin preparation, including shaving
- Preexistent sepsis (local or distant)

\section*{Operative characteristics:}
- Include poor surgical technique
- Lengthy operation (>2 h)
- Intraoperative contamination, including infected theater staff and instruments and inadequate theater ventilation
- Prolonged preoperative stay in the hospital
- Hypothermia
- Pain
- Blood transfusion
- Tissue perfusion
- concentration of inspired oxygen

\section*{The type of procedure is a risk factor}
- Certain procedures are associated with a higher risk of wound contamination than others.
- Surgical wounds have been classified as clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated, and dirty-infected

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Classification & Description & Infective Risk (\%) \\
\hline Clean (Class I) & \begin{tabular}{l}
Uninfected operative wound \\
No acute inflammation \\
Closed primarily \\
Respiratory, gastrointestinal, biliary, and urinary tracts not entered \\
No break in aseptic technique \\
Closed drainage used if necessary
\end{tabular} & <2 \\
\hline Cleancontaminated (Class II) & \begin{tabular}{l}
Elective entry into respiratory, biliary, gastrointestinal, urinary tracts and with minimal spillage \\
No evidence of infection or major break in aseptic technique \\
Example: appendectomy
\end{tabular} & <10 \\
\hline Contaminated (Class III) & \begin{tabular}{l}
Nonpurulent inflammation present \\
Gross spillage from gastrointestinal tract \\
Penetrating traumatic wounds <4 hours \\
Major break in aseptic technique
\end{tabular} & About 20 \\
\hline Dirty-infected (Class IV) & \begin{tabular}{l}
Purulent inflammation present \\
Preoperative perforation of viscera \\
Penetrating traumatic wounds $>4$ hours
\end{tabular} & About 40 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- Wound healing is a continuum of complex interrelated biological processes at the molecular level
- Healing is divided into the following phases for descriptive purposes: inflammatory phase, proliferative phase, and maturation phase

\section*{Phase One: Inflammatory Phase}
- The inflammatory phase commences as soon as tissue integrity is disrupted by injury; this begins the coagulation cascade to limit bleeding.
- Platelets are the first of the cellular components that aggregate to the wound, and, as a result of their degranulation (platelet reaction), they release several cytokines (or paracrine growth factors).
- These cytokines include platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), insulinlike growth factor-1 (IGF-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF).
- Serotonin is also released, which, together with histamine (released by mast cells), induces a reversible opening of the junctions between the endothelial cells, allowing the passage of neutrophils and monocytes (which become macrophages) to the site of injury
- The substrate, or inflammatory, phase occurs during the first 5 to 6 days after injury.
- Leukocytes, histamines, prostaglandins, and fibrinogen, delivered to the injury site via blood and lymphatic channels, attempt to neutralize bacteria and foreign material.
- This large cellular movement to the injury site is induced by cytokines secreted by the platelets (chemotaxis) and by further chemotactic cytokines secreted by the macrophages themselves once at the site of injury.
- These include transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta).
- Consequently, an inflammatory exudate that contains red blood cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and plasma proteins, including coagulation cascade proteins and fibrin strands, fills the wound in a matter of hours.
- Macrophages not only scavenge but they also are central to the wound healing process because of their cytokine secretion

\section*{Phase Two: Proliferative phase}
- The fibroblastic, or collagen, phase occupies days 6 though 20 after injury.
- Fibroblasts enter the wound rapidly and begin collagen synthesis, which binds the wound together
- The proliferative phase begins as the cells that migrate to the site of injury, such as fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and vascular endothelial cells, start to proliferate and the cellularity of the wound increases.
- The cytokines involved in this phase include FGFs, particularly FGF-2 (previously known as basic FGF), which stimulates angiogenesis and epithelial cell and fibroblast proliferation.
- The marginal basal cells at the edge of the wound migrate across the wound, and, within 48 hours, the entire wound is epithelialized.
- In the depth of the wound, the number of inflammatory cells decreases with the increase in stromal cells, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, which, in turn, continue to secrete cytokines.
- Cellular proliferation continues with the formation of extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen and new capillaries (angiogenesis).
- This process is variable in length and may last several weeks

\section*{Phase Three: Maturation (Remodeling) Phase}
- The wound continues to undergo remodeling for 18 to 24 months, during which time collagen synthesis continues and retraction occurs.
- Normally during this time the scar becomes softer and less conspicuous.
- The prominent color of the scar gradually fades, resulting in a hue consistent with the surrounding skin.
- In the maturation phase, the dominant feature is collagen.
- The dense bundle of fibers, characteristic of collagen, is the predominant constituent of the scar.
- Wound contraction occurs to some degree in primary closed wounds but is a pronounced feature in wounds left to close by secondary intention.
- The cells responsible for wound contraction are called myofibroblasts, which resemble fibroblasts but have cytoplasmic actin filaments responsible for contraction
- The wound continuously undergoes remodeling to try to achieve a state similar to that prior to injury.
- The wound has $70-80 \%$ of its original tensile strength at 3-4 months postoperative

\section*{Pathology}

\section*{Wound contamination}
- The presence of non-replicating bacteria in the wound.
- All chronic wounds are contaminated by bacteria.
- Contaminants come from the indigenous microflora and/or the environment

\section*{Wound colonization}
- The presence of replicating bacteria adherent to the wound in the absence of injury to the host.
- Most of the following organisms are normal skin flora.

\section*{Wound infection}
- The presence of replicating bacteria within a wound that cause host injury.

\section*{Classification}
- The most useful classification of wounds from a practical point of view is that of Rank and Wakefield into tidy and untidy wounds;

\section*{Tidy wounds}
- Tidy wounds are inflicted by sharp instruments and contain no devitalised tissue; such wounds can be closed primarily with the expectation of quiet primary healing.
- Examples are surgical incisions, cuts from glass and knife wounds.
- Skin wounds will usually be single and clean cut.
- Tendons, arteries and nerves will commonly be injured in tidy wounds, but repair of these structures is usually possible
- Fractures are uncommon in tidy wounds.

\section*{Untidy wounds}
- Untidy wounds result from crushing, tearing, avulsion, vascular injury or burns, and contain devitalised tissue
- Skin wounds will often be multiple and irregular.
- Tendons, arteries and nerves may be exposed, and might be injured in continuity, but will usually not be divided.

Fractures are common and may be multifragmentary.
- Such wounds must not be closed primarily; if they are closed wound healing is unlikely to occur without complications.
- At best there may be wound dehiscence, infection and delayed healing, at worst gas gangrene and death may result.
- The correct management of untidy wounds is wound excision, by this is meant excision of all devitalised tissue to create a tidy wound.
Once the untidy wound has been converted to a tidy wound by the process of wound excision it can be safely closed (or allowed to heal by second intention).

\section*{Clinical features}

History
Definitions of surgical site infection
Superficial incisional SSI:
Infection involves only skin and subcutaneous tissue of incision.
Deep incisional SSI:
Infection involves deep tissues, such as fascial and muscle layers.
This also includes infection involving both superficial and deep incision sites and organ/space SSI draining through incision.

Organ/space SSI:

Infection involves any part of the anatomy in organs and spaces other than the incision, which was opened or manipulated during operation.

Physical

According to a report by the NNIS program, surgical site infections are defined as follows:

\section*{Superficial incisional SSI}

Occurs within 30 days after the operation
Involves only the skin or subcutaneous tissue
At least 1 of the following:
Purulent drainage is present (culture documentation not required).
Organisms are isolated from fluid/tissue of the superficial incision.
At least 1 sign of inflammation (eg, pain or tenderness, induration, erythema, local warmth of the wound) is present.
The wound is deliberately opened by the surgeon.
The surgeon or clinician declares the wound infected.
Note: A wound is not considered a superficial incisional SSI if a stitch abscess is present; if the infection is at an episiotomy, a circumcision site, or a burn wound; or if the SSI extends into fascia or muscle.

\section*{Deep incisional SSI}

Occurs within 30 days of the operation or within 1 year if an implant is present
Involves deep soft tissues (e.g. fascia and/or muscle) of the incision
At least 1 of the following:
Purulent drainage is present from the deep incision but without organ/space involvement.
Fascial dehiscence or fascia is deliberately separated by the surgeon because of signs of inflammation.
A deep abscess is identified by direct examination or during reoperation, by histopathology, or by radiologic examination.
The surgeon or clinician declares that a deep incisional infection is present.

\section*{Organ/space SSI}

Occurs within 30 days of the operation or within 1 year if an implant is present
Involves anatomical structures not opened or manipulated during the operation
At least 1 of the following:

Purulent drainage is present from a drain placed by a stab wound into the organ/space.
Organisms are isolated from the organ/space by aseptic culturing technique.
An abscess in the organ/space is identified by direct examination, during reoperation, or by histopathologic or radiologic examination.
A diagnosis of organ/space SSI is made by the surgeon or clinician.

\section*{Investigations}

\section*{Laboratory}

Staining methods: The simplest, and usually the quickest, method involves obtaining a Gram stain for infective organisms.
Staining for fungal elements can be obtained at the same time
Culture techniques: Most laboratories routinely will culture for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms.
Fungal cultures can be requested.
Isolation of single colonies allows further growth and identification of the specific organism.
Sensitivity testing then follows mainly for aerobic organisms

\section*{Imaging}

Ultrasonography can be applied to the infected wound area to assess whether any collection needs drainage.

\section*{Treatment}

\section*{Medical care}

General agreement exists that prophylactic antibiotics are indicated for clean-contaminated and contaminated wounds
Antibiotics for dirty wounds are part of the treatment because infection is established already
Criteria for the use of systemic preventive antibiotics in surgical procedures are as follows:
Systemic preventive antibiotics should be used in the following cases:
A high risk of infection is associated with the procedure (e.g. colon resection).

Consequences of infection are unusually severe (e.g. total joint replacement).
The patient has a high NNIS risk index.
The antibiotic should be administered preoperatively but as close to the time of the incision as is clinically practical.
Antibiotics should be administered before induction of anesthesia in most situations.
The antibiotic selected should have activity against the pathogens likely to be encountered in the procedure.
Postoperative administration of preventive systemic antibiotics beyond 24 hours has not been demonstrated to reduce the risk of SSIs.

\section*{Surgical care}

Treatment is individualized to the patient, the wound, and the nature of the infection
Preoperatively, attention should be paid to factors like optimization of patient status, proper asepsis, and surgical site preparation.
Intraoperatively, adherence to good basic surgical principles of minimal and fine tissue dissection, proper selection of suture materials, and proper wound closure is important
If a SSI sets in, the treatment often involves opening the wound, evacuating pus, and cleansing the wound.
The deeper tissues are inspected for integrity and for a deep space infection or source. Dressing changes allow the tissues to granulate, and the wound heals by secondary intention over several weeks.
Early/delayed closure of infected wounds is often associated with relapse of infection and wound dehiscence
The goals of primary closure are to stop bleeding, prevent infection, preserve function, and restore appearance.

\section*{Newer concepts in the prevention of SSIs}

\section*{Blood glucose}

Evidence shows that the close regulation of blood sugar may be a major determinant of wound morbidity.

\section*{Body temperature}

There is now a prospective randomized study that demonstrates that failure to maintain intraoperative core body temperature within $1-1.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ of normal increases the SSI rate by a factor of 2 .

\section*{Oxygenation}

The fresh, hemostatic surgical incision is a hypoxic, ischemic environment. Maintaining or increasing oxygen delivery to the wound by increasing the inspired oxygen concentration administered to the patient perioperatively has also been shown to reduce the incidence of SSIs.
It is presumed that increased oxygen availability is a positive host factor, perhaps via enhanced production of oxidant products that facilitate phagocytic eradication of microbes

\section*{SUTURING}

\section*{Wound Closure}

A well-closed wound has three characteristics: the margins are approximated without tension, the tissue layers are accurately aligned, and dead space is eliminated.

\section*{Suture Techniques}

\section*{1. Simple Interrupted Stitch}
1. A simple interrupted stitch is placed by passing the needle through the skin surface at right angles, placing the suture as wide as it is deep.
2. The goal is to place sutures that slightly evert the edge of the wound
3. This maneuver produces a slightly raised scar that recedes during the remodeling stage of healing and leaves a smooth scar

\section*{2. Vertical or Horizontal Mattress Suture}
1. The vertical mattress suture promotes eversion and is useful where thick layers are encountered or tension exists.

\section*{3. Intracuticular Running Suture}
: The intracuticular running suture, utilizing a nonabsorbable suture, can be used where there is minimal skin tension.
A It results in minimal scarring without suture marks.
Controlled tissue apposition is difficult with this method, but it is a popular technique because of the cosmetic result.

\section*{4. Three-Point Mattress Suture}

The three-point or corner stitch is used to minimize the possibility of vascular necrosis of the tip of a V-shaped wound.

\section*{5. Running or Continuous Stitch}

The running stitch is useful in situations where speed is important (e.g., a field emergency) because individual knots do not have to be tied.
A It is appropriate for use on scalp lacerations especially, because it is good for hemostasis

\section*{Alternatives to Suturing}

\section*{Staples}

A Typically, staples are used on the skin in wounds that would be closed in a straight line. The skin is closed with staples after other layers are closed by suturing.

\section*{Adhesives}

The most commonly used tissue glues are related to cyanoacrylate ester known as Super Glue. Tissue glues for superficial wounds have the advantage of rapid closure, minimal physical and emotional trauma to the patient, and absence of a foreign body in the wound
A Histoacryl Blue, a.k.a. Derma bond, has been commercially available in Canada since 1975, and in the United States since 1998.
