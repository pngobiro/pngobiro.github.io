                        <p>When urine cannot be eliminated naturally and must be drained artificially, catheters may be inserted directly into the bladder, the ureter, or the renal pelvis.</p>
                        <p>Catheters vary in size, shape, length, material, and configuration.</p>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Types of catheterization</h3>
                        <h4>Urethral Catheter</h4>
                        <p>common system consists of an indwelling catheter, a connecting tube, and a collecting bag with an antireflux chamber emptied by a drainage spout</p>
                        <p>Another system has a triple-lumen indwelling urethral catheter attached to a closed sterile drainage system. With the triple-lumen catheter, urinary drainage occurs through one channel</p>
                        <p>Triple-lumen catheters are commonly used after transurethral prostate surgery.</p>

                        <h4>Suprapubic Catheterization.</h4>
                        <p>Suprapubic catheterization allows bladder drainage by inserting a catheter or tube into the bladder through a suprapubic incision or puncture</p>

                        <h3>Indications of suprapubic catheterization</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Injuries to the urethra</li>
                            <li>Strictures in the urethra</li>
                            <li>Prostatic obstruction,</li>
                            <li>After gynecologic or other abdominal surgery when bladder dysfunction is likely to occur, and</li>
                            <li>Occasionally after pelvic fractures.</li>
                            <li>long-term basis for women with urethral destruction secondary to long-term indwelling urethral catheters</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Advantages of spc</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patients can usually void sooner after surgery than those with urethral catheters,</li>
                            <li>More comfortable.</li>
                            <li>The catheter allows greater mobility, permits measurement of residual urine without urethral instrumentation</li>
                            <li>Less risk of bladder infection.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Insertion of SPC</h3>
                        <p>The patient is placed in a supine position Bladder distended by administering The suprapubic area is prepared as for surgery and the puncture site located about 5 cm above symphysis pubis.
                        The bladder is entered through an incision or through a puncture made by a small trocar (pointed instrument).
                        The catheter or suprapubic drainage tube is threaded into the bladder and secured with sutures or tape; the area around the catheter is covered with a sterile dressing.</p>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Dialysis is used to remove fluid and uremic waste products from the body when the kidneys cannot do so.</p>
                        <p>It may also be used to treat patients with edema that does not respond to treatment, hepatic coma, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, hypertension, and uremia.</p>
                        <p>Methods of therapy include hemodialysis, continuous renal replacement therapy and various forms of peritoneal dialysis.</p>

                        <h3>Definitions</h3>
                        <p><b>Vascular graft:</b> A surgically placed artificial tube between a vein and artery (usually in the arm).</p>
                        <p>- Accessed via needle for HD</p>
                        <p><b>Dialysate:</b> A balanced electrolyte solution on one side of the semi-permeable membrane to exchange solutes with blood during HD</p>
                        <p><b>Dialysis water:</b> Purified water that is used to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>mix dialysate</li>
                            <li>to disinfect, rinse, or reprocess the dialyser</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>The dialyser:</b> is the piece of equipment that filters the blood</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_18_fd784e437e79488fd5ecg-36-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of a dialyser showing blood and dialysate flow for filtering blood." class="content-image">
                        </figure>

                        <h3>Acute and chronic dialysis</h3>
                        <p>Acute dialysis is indicated when there is a high and rising level of serum potassium, fluid overload, or impending pulmonary edema, increasing acidosis, pericarditis, and severe confusion</p>
                        <p>Chronic or maintenance dialysis is indicated in chronic renal failure, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD)</p>
                        <p>An urgent indication for dialysis in patients with chronic renal failure is pericardial friction rub.</p>

                        <h3>Hemodialysis</h3>
                        <p>A dialyzer (once referred to as an artificial kidney) serves as a synthetic semipermeable membrane, replacing the renal glomeruli and tubules as the filter for the impaired kidneys</p>
                        <figure>
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_18_fd784e437e79488fd5ecg-39-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating the hemodialysis process where blood is taken from an arm, filtered through a dialyzer, and returned to the body." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>Blood passes over a semi-permeable membrane which allows some molecules to pass through.</p>
                        <p>The patient's blood enters the machine from an access point: A fistula, vascular graft, or a temporary central line.</p>
                        <p>Fluid removal is achieved by altering the hydrostatic pressure of the dialysate compartment, causing free water and some dissolved solutes to move across the membrane along a created pressure gradient.</p>

                        <h3>Complications of hemodialysis</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease</li>
                            <li>Hypertriglyceridemia</li>

                        </figure>
                        <p>The process uses the patient's peritoneum in the abdomen as a membrane across which fluids and dissolved substances (electrolytes, urea, glucose, albumin and other small molecules) are exchanged from the blood.</p>
                        <p>Fluid is introduced through a permanent tube in the abdomen and flushed out either every night while the patient sleeps (automatic peritoneal dialysis) or via regular exchanges throughout the day (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis).</p>
                        <p>Most catheters are silicone</p>
                        <p>Fluid is removed to take out toxins</p>

                            <li>Hypertriglyceridemia</li>
                            <li>abdominal hernias (incisional, inguinal, diaphragmatic, and umbilical), probably resulting from continuously increased intraabdominal pressure.</li>
                            <li>Hemorrhoids.</li>
                            <li>Low back pain and anorexia</li>
                            <li>Peritonitis</li>
                            <li>Bleeding</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Stoma is an opening that is created to allow stool or urine to pass out of the body.</p>
                        <p>Common conditions that might necessitate a stoma are:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Imperforate anus: where there is no exit for the bowel or its contents.</li>
                            <li>Hirschsprungs disease: where nerves called the ganglion nerves are missing and waste matter cannot easily pass.</li>
                            <li>Inflammatory bowel disease: this includes Crohns Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, both inflammatory diseases of the intestines.</li>
                            <li>Neonatal necrotising enterocolitis: this occurs when a portion of the bowel is dead and cannot function</li>
                            <li>Spina bifida</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Stomas will be a pinkish red in colour, similar to the inside of your mouth, and will be soft and moist.</p>
                        <p>Stomas have no nerve endings and therefore no feeling so it will not hurt when touched.</p>
                        <p>The stoma may sit out above or be slightly below the skin level.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Types of stoma</h3>
                        <h4>Colostomy</h4>
                        <p>This is the most common stoma type.</p>
                        <p>A colostomy is an opening made into the large intestine or colon.</p>
                        <p>The stool can then pass from the stoma out of your child's body which tends to be solid in consistency but can sometimes be liquid</p>

                        <h4>Ileostomy</h4>
                        <p>In an ileostomy the opening is made in the small intestine - the ileum.</p>
                        <p>An end or loop of the small intestine is brought through the skin's surface on the abdomen and the output then passes out through the stoma.</p>
                        <p>Due to the fact that ileostomy output contains digestive enzymes, this can be harmful to the skin and so requires extra care when pouching.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_18_fd784e437e79488fd5ecg-55-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing an ileostomy, where the small intestine is diverted to a stoma on the abdomen." class="content-image">

                        <h4>Urostomy</h4>

                        <h3>How to change a pouch</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For an open-ended pouch, empty the contents from pouch into the toilet.</li>
                            <li>Gently remove the pouch by pushing the skin down and away from the adhesive skin barrier with one hand.</li>
                            <li>With the other hand, pull the pouch up and away from the stoma</li>
                            <li>Clean the skin around the stoma with warm water. You may also use soap but do not use soaps that have oil or perfumes</li>
                            <li>Use skin protection products if you have irritated skin around the stoma.</li>
                            <li>Center the pouch over the stoma and press it firmly into place on clean, dry skin.</li>
                            <li>It may be helpful to hold your hand over the newly applied pouch for 30 seconds. The warmth of your hand can help to mold the adhesive skin barrier into place.</li>
                            <li>Place the old pouch in another plastic bag to be thrown away if the pouch is disposable.</li>
                            <li>If you use a reusable pouch, talk to your caregiver about how to clean the reusable pouch</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>How to empty a pouch</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Empty the pouch when it is one-third to one-half full.</li>
                            <li>Do not wait until the pouch is completely full because this could put pressure on the seal, causing a leak. The pouch may also detach, causing all of the pouch contents to spill.</li>
                            <li>Take the end of the pouch and hold it up. Remove the clamp (if the pouch has a clamp system).</li>
                            <li>You may need to make a cuff at the end of the pouch to keep it from getting soiled</li>
                            <li>Drain the pouch by squeezing</li>
                            <li>Clean the cuffed end of the pouch with toilet paper or a moist paper towel</li>
                            <li>Undo the cuff at the end of the pouch. Replace the clamp or close the end of the pouch</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Assessment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assess the location of the stoma and the type of colostomy performed.</li>
                            <li>Stoma location is an indicator of the section of bowel in which it is located and a predictor of the type of fecal drainage</li>
                            <li>Assess stoma appearance and surrounding skin condition frequently</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>intervention</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Position a collection bag or drainable pouch over the stoma.</li>
                            <li>Initial drainage may contain more mucus and serosanguineous fluid than fecal material.</li>
                            <li>irrigate the colostomy, instilling water into the colon similar to an enema procedure. The water stimulates the colon to empty.</li>
                            <li>When a colostomy irrigation is ordered for a client with a double-barrel or loop colostomy, irrigate the proximal stoma</li>
                            <li>Empty a drainable pouch or replace the colostomy bag as needed or when it is no more than one-third full</li>
                            <li>Good skin and stoma care is important to maintain skin integrity and function</li>
                            <li>For patients with loop colostomy Use stomahesive or skin barrier wafer as needed to maintain a secure ostomy pouch</li>
                            <li>A small needle hole high on the colostomy pouch will allow flatus to escape. This hole may be closed with a Band-Aid and opened only while the client is in the bathroom for odor control.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Client and family care</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prior to discharge, provide written, verbal, and psychomotor instruction on colostomy care,pouch management, skin care, and irrigation for the client</li>
                            <li>Allow ample time for the client (and family, if necessary) to practice changing the pouch, either on the client or a model.</li>
                            <li>If an abdominoperineal resection has been performed, emphasize the importance of using no rectal suppositories, rectal temperatures, or enemas.</li>

                        <p>also used to evaluate esophageal and gastric motility and to collect secretions and tissue specimens</p>
                        <p>Upper GI fibroscopy also can be a therapeutic procedure when it is combined with other procedures.</p>
                        <p>Therapeutic endoscopy can be used to remove common bile duct stones, dilate strictures, and treat gastric bleeding and esophageal varices.</p>
                        <p>Laser-compatible scopes can be used to provide laser therapy for upper GI neoplasms.</p>
                        <p>Sclerosing solutions can be injected through the scope in an attempt to control upper Gl bleeding.</p>

                            <li>particles (electrons [beta particles], protons, neutrons, and alpha particles)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Radiotherapy can lead to tissue disruption</p>
                        <p>most harmful tissue disruption is the alteration of the DNA molecule within the cells of the tissue.</p>
                        <p>Ionizing radiation breaks the strands of the DNA helix, leading to cell death.</p>
                        <p>Can also ionize constituents of body fluids, especially water, leading to the formation of free radicals and irreversibly damaging DNA.</p>
                        <p>If the DNA is incapable of repair, the cell dies</p>

                        <h3>Types of radiotherapy</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>External radiation:- x-rays are used to destroy cancerous cells at the skin surface or deeper in the body.</li>
                            <li>Internal radiation:- implantation, or brachytherapy, delivers a high dose of radiation to a localized area. The specific radioisotope for implantation is selected on the basis of its half-life</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Nursing Management in Radiotherapy</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Explain the procedure for delivering radiation and describe the equipment, the duration of the procedure</li>
                            <li>If a radioactive implant is used, the nurse informs the patient and family about the restrictions placed on visitors and health care personnel and other radiation precautions</li>
                            <li>Protect the skin and the mucosa- assess signs of irritation, restriction on use of ointments</li>
                            <li>Gentle oral hygiene is essential to remove debris, prevent irritation and promote healing</li>
                            <li>Protect the caregivers</li>
                        </ul>
