Advance nursing procedures

\section*{1. Lumbar puncture (LP)}
- Refers to the insertion of a hollow tube needle under local anesthesia into the subarachnoid space of the spinal canal to obtain csf
- The needle is usually inserted into the subarachnoid space between the third and fourth or fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae.

\section*{Indications for LP}
- to obtain CSF for examination,
- to measure and reduce CSF pressure,
- to determine the presence or absence of blood in the CSF,
- to detect spinal subarachnoid block,
- to administer antibiotics intrathecally (into the spinal canal) in certain cases of infection.
- to administer anesthetic agent during surgery

\section*{CSF}
- The CSF should be clear and colorless.
- Pink, blood-tinged, or grossly bloody CSF may indicate a cerebral contusion, laceration, or subarachnoid hemorrhage.
- Usually, specimens are obtained for cell count, culture, and glucose and protein testing.
- The specimens should be sent to the laboratory immediately because changes

\section*{Pre procedure management}
- Determine whether written consent for the procedure has been obtained.
- Explain the procedure to the patient and describe sensations that are likely during the procedure
- Reassure the patient that the needle will not enter the spinal cord or cause paralysis.
- Instruct the patient to void before the procedure

\section*{During the procedure}
- The nurse assists the patient to maintain the position to avoid sudden movement, which can produce a traumatic (bloody) tap.
- The patient is encouraged to relax and is instructed to breathe normally

\section*{Post procedure}
- Instruct the patient to lie prone for 2 to 3 hours to separate the alignment of the dural and arachnoid needle punctures in the meninges, to reduce leakage of CSF.
- Monitor the patient for complications of lumbar puncture; notify physician if complications occur.
- Encourage increased fluid intake to reduce the risk of postprocedure headache.

\section*{Complications of LP}
- Headache
- Herniation of the intracranial contents,
- Spinal epidural abscess,
- Spinal epidural hematoma,
- Meningitis
- Temporary voiding problems,
- Slight elevation of temperature,
- Backache or spasms,
- Stiffness of the neck

\section*{Paracentesis}
- Puncturing of the peritoneum to remove fluid
- Used for
- Drainage of ascites
- Fluid for lab investigations (histopathology)
- For relieving pressure on the chest and abdominal organs
- find the cause of fluid build up

\section*{Before the procedure}
- Take medical history or any allergies to drugs
- History of bleeding disorders or blood thinning medication
- Assess for pregnancy
- Advise the patient to empty bladder
- Check for a signed consent

\section*{During the procedure}
- Ensure privacy
- Shave the skin clean
- Record basal vital signs;
- Maintain patency of IV lines, for emergency medications and fluids
- Observe the fluid color and measure quantity
- Immediately seal the puncture wound with sterile dressing

\section*{After the procedure}
- Monitor IO
- Monitor vital continuously
- Observe for any complication within the first 24 hours

\section*{Complications}
- Fevers higher than 100 f
- Sever belly pain
- More redness or tenderness
- Blood in urine
- Bleeding from the site

CATHETERIZATION

\section*{Catheterization}
- Refers to the introduction of a plastic tube through the urethra into the bladder
- When urine cannot be eliminated naturally and must be drained artificially, catheters may be inserted directly into the bladder, the ureter, or the renal pelvis.
- Catheters vary in size, shape, length, material, and configuration.

\section*{Catheterization ct}
- Catheterization is performed to achieve the following:
$\checkmark$ Relieve urinary tract obstruction
$\checkmark$ Assist with postoperative drainage in urologic and other surgeries
$\checkmark$ Monitor accurate urine output in critically ill patients
$\checkmark$ Promote urinary drainage in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction or urine retention
$\checkmark$ Prevent urinary leakage in patients with stage III to IV pressure ulcers

\section*{Types of catheterization}
- Urethral Catheter
- common system consists of an indwelling catheter, a connecting tube, and a collecting bag with an antireflux chamber emptied by a drainage spout
- Another system has a triple-lumen indwelling urethral catheter attached to a closed sterile drainage system. With the triple-lumen catheter, urinary drainage occurs through one channel
- Triple-lumen catheters are commonly used after transurethral prostate surgery.

\section*{Types of catheterization}

\section*{Suprapubic Catheterization.}
- Suprapubic catheterization allows bladder drainage by inserting a catheter or tube into the bladder through a suprapubic incision or puncture

\section*{Indications of suprapubic catheterization}
- Injuries to the urethra
- Strictures in the urethra
- Prostatic obstruction,
- After gynecologic or other abdominal surgery when bladder dysfunction is likely to occur, and
- Occasionally after pelvic fractures.
- long-term basis for women with urethral destruction secondary to long-term indwelling urethral catheters

\section*{Advantages of spc}
- Patients can usually void sooner after surgery than those with urethral catheters,
- More comfortable.
- The catheter allows greater mobility, permits measurement of residual urine without urethral instrumentation
- Less risk of bladder infection.

\section*{Insertion of SPC}

The patient is placed in a supine position Bladder distended by administering The suprapubic area is prepared as for surgery and the puncture site located about 5 cm above symphysis pubis.
The bladder is entered through an incision or through a puncture made by a small trocar (pointed instrument).
The catheter or suprapubic drainage tube is threaded into the bladder and secured with sutures or tape; the area around the catheter is covered with a sterile dressing.

\section*{Nursing intervention}
- During catheterization
- Assessing the patient and the system
- assesses the drainage system to ensure that it provides adequate urinary drainage.
- Monitor the color, odor and volume of the urine

\section*{Nursing intervention}
- Assessing for age-related complications
- In the elderly, change in physical condition or mental status must be considered a possible indication of infection and promptly investigated because sepsis may occur before the infection is diagnosed

\section*{Nursing intervention}
- Preventing infection- Most urinary tract infections follow instrumentation of the urinary tract, usually catheterization
- Minimizing trauma:- by:
- Using an appropriate-sized catheter
- Lubricating the catheter adequately with a water-soluble lubricant during insertion
- Retraining the bladder:- by making a voiding schedule

Biopsy

\section*{Introduction}
- A biopsy is a medical procedure involving taking a small sample of body tissue for examination
- Abnormalities examined can be functional or structural
- Biopsy examination helps in diagnosis of a specific condition or in assessing severity of a condition

\section*{Introduction ct}
- Examples of conditions requiring biopsy
- Cancer
- Inflammation eg nephritis or hepatitis
- Infections especially in the lymph nodes eg tb
- Various skin conditions

\section*{Types of biopsy}
- A punch biopsy- a special instrument punches a small hole in the skin to obtain skin sample
- A needle biopsy- a special hollow needle, guided by X-ray, CT scan etc is used to obtain a tissue from an organ
- A needle biopsy can be Fine Needle Aspiration, Core Needle Biopsy, Vacuum Assisted Biopsy
- Endoscopic biopsy- an endoscope is used to remove a tissue
- Excision biopsy-surgery is done to remove a larger section of tissue
- Perioperative biopsy-

\section*{Nursing intervention}

\section*{Before the procedure}
- Review the chart for a signed consent
- Keep NPO when prescribed
- Assess and record baseline vital signs
- Review laboratory results
- Instruct the patient to empty bladder
- Teach about the procedure and its purpose

\section*{During the procedure}
- Help client hold breathe following expiration
- Assess for pain or discomfort during procedure
- Receive the tissue in the designated container, cork well and preserve in the right fluid

\section*{After the procedure}
- Apply direct pressure on the site in case of needle aspiration
- Frequently assess the site for bleeding
- Assess the vital signs regularly
- Advice on the pain management
- Report immediately any incidence of bleeding from the site
- Keep NPO as prescribed
- For liver biopsy, advice to avoid lifting, coughing or straining for 2 weeks

Dialysis

\section*{Introduction}
- Dialysis is used to remove fluid and uremic waste products from the body when the kidneys cannot do so.
- It may also be used to treat patients with edema that does not respond to treatment, hepatic coma, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, hypertension, and uremia.
- Methods of therapy include hemodialysis, continuous renal replacement therapy and various forms of peritoneal dialysis.

\section*{Def}

Vascular graft: A surgically placed artificial tube between a vein and artery (usually in the arm).
- Accessed via needle for HD

Dialysate: A balanced electrolyte solution on one side of the semi-permeable membrane to exchange solutes with blood during HD Dialysis water: Purified water that is used to:
- mix dialysate
- to disinfect, rinse, or reprocess the dialyser

\section*{Def}

\section*{The dialyser: is the piece of equipment that filters the blood}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_18_fd784e437e79488fd5ecg-36.jpg?height=1447&width=1119&top_left_y=421&top_left_x=1336)

\section*{Acute and chronic dialysis}
- Acute dialysis is indicated when there is a high and rising level of serum potassium, fluid overload, or impending pulmonary edema, increasing acidosis, pericarditis, and severe confusion
- Chronic or maintenance dialysis is indicated in chronic renal failure, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
- An urgent indication for dialysis in patients with chronic renal failure is pericardial friction rub.

\section*{Types of dialysis}

\section*{Hemodialysis}
- A dialyzer (once referred to as an artificial kidney) serves as a synthetic semipermeable membrane, replacing the renal glomeruli and tubules as the filter for the impaired kidneys

\section*{Hemodialysis}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_18_fd784e437e79488fd5ecg-39.jpg?height=1320&width=1914&top_left_y=520&top_left_x=383)

\section*{Hemodialysis ct}
- Blood passes over a semi-permeable membrane which allows some molecules to pass through.
- The patient's blood enters the machine from an access point: A fistula, vascular graft, or a temporary central line.
- Fluid removal is achieved by altering the hydrostatic pressure of the dialysate compartment, causing free water and some dissolved solutes to move across the membrane along a created pressure gradient.

\section*{Complications of hemodialysis}
- atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
- Hypertriglyceridemia
- Heart failure
- coronary heart disease
- anginal pain
- stroke
- peripheral vascular insufficiency
- Anemia
- Gastric ulcers
- bone pain and fractures
- fluid overload associated with heart failure
- malnutrition
- infection
- neuropathy
- pruritus.

\section*{Peritoneal Dialysis}

\end{figure}

\section*{Peritoneal dialysis}
- The process uses the patient's peritoneum in the abdomen as a membrane across which fluids and dissolved substances (electrolytes, urea, glucose, albumin and other small molecules) are exchanged from the blood.
- Fluid is introduced through a permanent tube in the abdomen and flushed out either every night while the patient sleeps (automatic peritoneal dialysis) or via regular exchanges throughout the day (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis).

\section*{Peritoneal dialysis}
- Most catheters are silicone
- Fluid is removed to take out toxins
- Most common types include:
a) Chronic ambulatory
b) Continuous cyclical
c) Chronic intermittent

\section*{Complications of peritoneal dialysis}
- Hypertriglyceridemia
- abdominal hernias (incisional, inguinal, diaphragmatic, and umbilical), probably resulting from continuously increased intraabdominal pressure.
- Hemorrhoids.
- Low back pain and anorexia
- Peritonitis
- Bleeding

\section*{Nursing intervention}

\section*{Before dialysis}
- Explain the procedure to the patient and obtains signed consent for it.
- Take baseline vital signs, weight, and serum electrolyte
- Encourage the patient to empty the bladder and bowel to reduce the risk of puncturing internal organs.
- Assess the patient's anxiety about the procedure and provide support and instruction.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotic agents may be administered to prevent infection.

\section*{Nursing management}
- Frequently conduct cardiac and respiratory assessment
- Control electrolyte levels and diet
- Manage discomfort and pain
- Care for the catheter site
- Administer medications
- Provide psychological support
- Monitor blood pressure
- Prevent infection

STOMA CARE

\section*{Stoma care}
- Stoma is an opening that is created to allow stool or urine to pass out of the body.
- Common conditions that might necessitate a stoma are:
a) Imperforate anus: where there is no exit for the bowel or its contents.
b) Hirschsprungs disease: where nerves called the ganglion nerves are missing and waste matter cannot easily pass.
c) Inflammatory bowel disease: this includes Crohns Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, both inflammatory diseases of the intestines.
d) Neonatal necrotising enterocolitis: this occurs when a portion of the bowel is dead and cannot function
e) Spina bifida

\section*{Stoma}
- Stomas will be a pinkish red in colour, similar to the inside of your mouth, and will be soft and moist.
- Stomas have no nerve endings and therefore no feeling so it will not hurt when touched.
- The stoma may sit out above or be slightly below the skin level.

\section*{Types of stoma}

\section*{Colostomy}
- This is the most common stoma type.
- A colostomy is an opening made into the large intestine or colon.
- The stool can then pass from the stoma out of your child's body which tends to be solid in consistency but can sometimes be liquid
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_18_fd784e437e79488fd5ecg-53.jpg?height=1073&width=1970&top_left_y=450&top_left_x=457)

\section*{Ileostomy}
- In an ileostomy the opening is made in the small intestine - the ileum.
- An end or loop of the small intestine is brought through the skin's surface on the abdomen and the output then passes out through the stoma.
- Due to the fact that ileostomy output contains digestive enzymes, this can be harmful to the skin and so requires extra care when pouching.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_18_fd784e437e79488fd5ecg-55.jpg?height=1510&width=1914&top_left_y=323&top_left_x=288)

\section*{Urostomy}
- Is an opening made to divert urine from the bladder and also resembles a 'spout' as the output is urine.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_18_fd784e437e79488fd5ecg-56.jpg?height=989&width=1725&top_left_y=956&top_left_x=312)

\section*{How to change a pouch}
- For an open-ended pouch, empty the contents from pouch into the toilet.
- Gently remove the pouch by pushing the skin down and away from the adhesive skin barrier with one hand.
- With the other hand, pull the pouch up and away from the stoma
- Clean the skin around the stoma with warm water. You may also use soap but do not use soaps that have oil or perfumes

\section*{How to change a pouch ct}
- Use skin protection products if you have irritated skin around the stoma.
- Center the pouch over the stoma and press it firmly into place on clean, dry skin.
- It may be helpful to hold your hand over the newly applied pouch for 30 seconds. The warmth of your hand can help to mold the adhesive skin barrier into place.
- Place the old pouch in another plastic bag to be thrown away if the pouch is disposable.
- If you use a reusable pouch, talk to your caregiver about how to clean the reusable pouch

\section*{How to empty a pouch}
- Empty the pouch when it is one-third to one-half full.
- Do not wait until the pouch is completely full because this could put pressure on the seal, causing a leak. The pouch may also detach, causing all of the pouch contents to spill.
- Take the end of the pouch and hold it up. Remove the clamp (if the pouch has a clamp system).
- You may need to make a cuff at the end of the pouch to keep it from getting soiled
- Drain the pouch by squeezing

\section*{How to empty a pouch ct}
- Clean the cuffed end of the pouch with toilet paper or a moist paper towel
- Undo the cuff at the end of the pouch. Replace the clamp or close the end of the pouch

\section*{Nursing management}
- Assessment
- Assess the location of the stoma and the type of colostomy performed.
- Stoma location is an indicator of the section of bowel in which it is located and a predictor of the type of fecal drainage
- Assess stoma appearance and surrounding skin condition frequently

\section*{intervention}
- Position a collection bag or drainable pouch over the stoma.
- Initial drainage may contain more mucus and serosanguineous fluid than fecal material.
- irrigate the colostomy, instilling water into the colon similar to an enema procedure.
The water stimulates the colon to empty.

\section*{Intervention ct}
-When a colostomy irrigation is ordered for a client with a double-barrel or loop colostomy, irrigate the proximal stoma
- Empty a drainable pouch or replace the colostomy bag as needed or when it is no more than one-third full
- Good skin and stoma care is important to maintain skin integrity and function
- For patients with loop colostomy Use stomahesive or skin barrier wafer as needed to maintain a secure ostomy pouch

\section*{ct}
- A small needle hole high on the colostomy pouch will allow flatus to escape. This hole may be closed with a Band-Aid and opened only while the client is in the bathroom for odor control.

\section*{Client and family care}
- Prior to discharge, provide written, verbal, and psychomotor instruction on colostomy care,pouch management, skin care, and irrigation for the client
- Allow ample time for the client (and family, if necessary) to practice changing the pouch, either on the client or a model.
- If an abdominoperineal resection has been performed, emphasize the importance of using no rectal suppositories, rectal temperatures, or enemas.

Washouts

\section*{Bowel (rectal) washouts}
- Rectal washouts are performed to decompress the lower intestine and deflate the abdomen by removing gas and stool using small amount of NS

\section*{Uses of washouts}
- In babies and children to relieve low IO eg in meconium plug
- As a temporary management of patients with hirschsprungs disease before surgery
- In management of enterocolitis
- Preoperatively in patients undergoing closure of stoma procedures
- Management of constipation in children

\section*{The procedure}
- Position the patient in a semi recumbent position or prone position
- Lubricate catheter tip and insert gently into the rectum
- Using syringe plunger Instill warm NS solution in $10-20 \mathrm{ml}$ aliquots over $1-2 \mathrm{mins}$
- Remove the syringe and let the fluid flow back to the kidney dish
- Repeat two to three times

\section*{Procedure ct}
- Remove the catheter from the rectum and leave the patient clean and dry
- Note and record the results accurately

\section*{Nursing management}
- Assess the frequency, color and amount of vomitus
- Assess any increase in amount and change in color of NG aspirate - green indicates IO
- Assess and describe the degree of distension of the abdomen
- Note the time of each bowel action frequency, amount, consistency and color

ENDOSCOPIC PROCEDURES

\section*{ENDOSCOPIC PROCEDURES}
- Endoscopic procedures used in GI tract assessment include
- fibroscopy/esophagogastroduodenoscopy, anoscopy, proctoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, small-bowel enteroscopy, and endoscopy through ostomy.

\section*{Fibroscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy)}
- Fiberscopes are flexible scopes equipped with fiberoptic lenses.
- Fibroscopy of the upper GI (EGD) allows direct visualization of the esophageal, gastric, and duodenal mucosa through a lighted endoscope
- Valuable when esophageal, gastric, or duodenal abnormalities or inflammatory, neoplastic, or infectious processes are suspected.
- also used to evaluate esophageal and gastric motility and to collect secretions and tissue specimens

\section*{Fibroscopy ct}
- Upper GI fibroscopy also can be a therapeutic procedure when it is combined with other procedures.
- Therapeutic endoscopy can be used to remove common bile duct stones, dilate strictures, and treat gastric bleeding and esophageal varices.
- Laser-compatible scopes can be used to provide laser therapy for upper GI neoplasms.
- Sclerosing solutions can be injected through the scope in an attempt to control upper Gl bleeding.

\section*{Nursing management}

Before the procedure
- Starve the patient 6-12 hrs
- Help the patient spray or gargle with a local anesthetic,
- Administer midazolam intravenously just before the scope is introduced.
- Administer atropine to reduce secretions,
- Give glucagon, if needed and prescribed, to relax smooth muscle.
- The nurse positions the patient on the left side to facilitate saliva drainage and to provide easy access for the endoscope.

After the procedure,
- The nurse instructs the patient not to eat or drink until the gag reflex returns (in 1 to 2 hours) , to prevent aspiration of food or fluids into the lungs.
- The nurse places the patient in the Simms position until he or she is awake and then places the patient in the semi-Fowler's position until ready for discharge.
- Observe for signs of perforation, such as pain, bleeding, unusual difficulty swallowing, and an elevated temperature

\section*{After the procedure ct}
- monitor the pulse and blood pressure for changes that can occur with sedation.
- test the gag reflex by placing a tongue blade onto the back of the throat to see whether gagging occurs.
- After the patient's gag reflex has returned, offer lozenges, saline gargle, and oral analgesics to relieve minor throat discomfort.
- Instruct the patient not to drive for 10 to 12 hours if sedation was used.

\section*{Anoscopy, Proctoscopy, and Sigmoidoscopy}
- The lower portion of the colon can be viewed directly to evaluate
- rectal bleeding
- acute or chronic diarrhea
- change in bowel patterns
- Ulceration, fissures, abscesses, tumors, polyps, or other pathologic processes.

\section*{Anoscopy, Proctoscopy, and Sigmoidoscopy ct}
- The anoscope is a rigid scope that is used to examine the anus and lower rectum.
- Proctoscopes and sigmoidoscopes are rigid scopes that are used to inspect the rectum and the sigmoid colon

\section*{Nursing management}
- These examinations require only limited bowel preparation, including a warm tap water or Fleet's enema until returns are clear.
- Dietary restrictions usually are not necessary, and sedation usually is not required.
- During the procedure,
- Monitor vital signs,
- skin color and temperature
- pain tolerance
- After the procedure,
- monitor the patient for rectal bleeding and signs of intestinal perforation (ie, fever, rectal drainage, abdominal distention, and pain).
- On completion of the examination, the patient can resume regular activities and dietary practices.

\section*{Colonoscopy}
- Direct visual inspection of the colon to the cecum by use of a fibreoptic scope

\section*{Uses of colonoscopy}
- used for cancer screening and for surveillance in patients with previous colon cancer or polyps.
- To obtain tissue biopsies
- To remove and evaluate polyps
- To evaluate patients with diarrhea of unknown cause, occult bleeding, or anemia;
- To determine the extent of inflammatory or other bowel disease

\section*{Nursing management}

\section*{BEFORE}
- Adequate colon cleansing will provide optimal visualization and decreases the time needed for the procedure
- Limit fluid intake
- Glucagon may be used, if needed, to relax the colonic musculature and to reduce spasm during the test
- Administer midazolam

\section*{Nursing management}

\section*{DURING the procedure}
- monitor for changes in oxygen saturation, vital signs, color and temperature of the skin, level of consciousness, abdominal distention, vagal response, and pain intensity

\section*{Nursing management}

After the procedure
- patients who were sedated are maintained on bed rest until fully alert. Some will have abdominal
- observes the patient for signs and symptoms of bowel perforation (eg, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain or distention,
- fever, focal peritoneal signs).
- If midazolam was used, the explain its amnesic effects.
- If the procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, someone must accompany and transport the patient home.
- Instruct the patient to report any bleeding to the physician.

Radiation therapy

\section*{RADIATION THERAPY}
- Ionizing radiation is used to interrupt cellular growth.
- Radiation may be used to cure the cancer, as in Hodgkin's disease, testicular seminomas, thyroid carcinomas, localized cancers of the head and neck, and cancers of the uterine cervix.
- Radiation therapy may also be used to control malignant disease when a tumor cannot be removed surgically or when local nodal metastasis is present
- It can be used prophylactically to prevent leukemic infiltration to the brain or spinal cord.
- Palliative radiation therapy is used to relieve the symptoms of metastatic disease

\section*{Radiotherapy ct}
- Two types of ionizing radiation-
- electromagnetic rays (x-rays and gamma rays)
- particles (electrons [beta particles], protons, neutrons, and alpha particles)

\section*{Radiotherapy}
- Radiotherapy can lead to tissue disruption
- most harmful tissue disruption is the alteration of the DNA molecule within the cells of the tissue.
- Ionizing radiation breaks the strands of the DNA helix, leading to cell death.
- Can also ionize constituents of body fluids, especially water, leading to the formation of free radicals and irreversibly damaging DNA.
- If the DNA is incapable of repair, the cell dies

\section*{Types of radiotherapy}
- External radiation:- x-rays are used to destroy cancerous cells at the skin surface or deeper in the body.
- Internal radiation:- implantation, or brachytherapy, delivers a high dose of radiation to a localized area. The specific radioisotope for implantation is selected on the basis of its half-life

\section*{Nursing Management in Radiotherapy}
- Explain the procedure for delivering radiation and describe the equipment, the duration of the procedure
- If a radioactive implant is used, the nurse informs the patient and family about the restrictions placed on visitors and health care personnel and other radiation precautions
- Protect the skin and the mucosa- assess signs of irritation, restriction on use of ointments
- Gentle oral hygiene is essential to remove debris, prevent irritation and promote healing
- Protect the caregivers
