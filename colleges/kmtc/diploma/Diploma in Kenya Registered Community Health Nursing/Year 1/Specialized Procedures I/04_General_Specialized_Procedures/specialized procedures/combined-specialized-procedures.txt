- Patients may need to have an area sterilized or shaved for a surgical procedure or the application of electrodes.
- Mentally preparing patients for testing by answering questions, explaining the procedure or test and possible outcomes.(refer to hospital policies).

\section*{Nursing responsibilities cont..}
3. Assist with testing
- Assisting both patients and other health care providers during diagnostic testing.
They provide patient care during the test which may include administering medicines when needed.
- Position patients properly, like rolling the patient over, in order to complete the necessary diagnostic testing.
- Transporting patients to and from the test can be part of their job.

\section*{Nursing responsibilities cont..}
4. Monitor patients during testing
- This includes monitoring their current medical condition, especially in those patients deemed unstable.
- They must check a patient's vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, breathing rate),
- Assess physical condition and keep an eye on any monitors that the patient needs to remain hooked up to during the tests, such as a heart monitor or ventilator.
- Nurses may also be required to connect or disconnect any monitors or devices that can interfere with the testing.

\section*{Nursing responsibilities cont..}
5. Reporting results
- Test results are reported to the patient's doctor, specialists and others in need of the information by nurses. Results may be phoned in, faxed or sent electronically via a computer.
- It may be the nurse's responsibility to check for the results of the tests as well.
* They may be in charge of entering the results into the patient's medical record.
- Nurses must also notify the patient's physician when abnormal or critical results that require an immediate response, such as abnormal blood work with critical potassium levels, are found.

Liver biopsy

\section*{Liver biopsy}
- Is a procedure where small pieces of liver tissue are removed in order to be sent to lab for examination
- It's helpful in the diagnosis of diseases that affect the liver E.g. liver cirrhosis

\section*{Purpose}
i. Diagnosis: this allows establishment of very specific diagnosis
ii. Monitoring: monitoring effectiveness of therapy that the patient is receiving for a liver disease. It can also provide warning if certain therapies the patients are receiving are damaging to the liver

\section*{Indications}
i. Alcoholic liver
ii. Elevated liver enzymes of unknown origin
iii. Jaundice and billiary tract obstruction iv. Hemochromatosis
v. Hepatomegally of undetermined cause
vi. Autoimmune liver disease
vii. Cancers of the liver and non cancerous tumor
viii. Chronic viral hepatitis
ix. Liver transplantation- to rule out

Procedure
Requirements on trolley:
As for bone marrow biopsy with addition of the following
- Scalpel or blade
- Specimen jar
- Menghini liver biopsy needle

Preparation
a) Ascertain the results of coagulation tests- prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count
b) Check for signed consent- confirm that informed consent has been provided

\section*{Preparation cont...}
c) Take and record patient's vital signs immediately before biopsy
d)Explain the procedure to the patient- steps of the procedure, sensations expected, after-effects expected, restrictions of activity and monitoring procedures to follow

\section*{Steps}
1. Support the patient during the procedure
2. Expose the right side of the patients upper abdomen(right hypochondriac)
3. Instruct the patient to inhale and exhale deeply several times finally to exhale and to hold breath at the end of expiration(prevents puncturing of the diaphragm and risk of lacerating the liver is minimized)
4. The physician promptly introduces the biopsy needle by way of the trans thoracic (inter costal) or trans abdominal (sub costal) route, penetrates the liver, aspirates and withdraws. The entire procedure is completed within 5-10 seconds.

\section*{Nursing care post procedure}
1)Immediately after biopsy, assist the patient to turn onto the right side; place a pillow under costal margin, and caution the patient to remain in this position, recumbent and immobile, for several hours.
- Instruct the patient to avoid coughing or straining.
- In this position, the liver capsule at the site of penetration is compressed against the chest wall, and the escape of blood or bile through the perforation is prevented.
2) Measure and record patients pulse, respiratory rate and BP at $10-15$ minutes intervals for the first hour , then 30 minutes for the next 2 hrs , or until the patient stabilizes.
- Changes in vital signs may indicate; bleeding, severe haemorrhage or bile peritonitis, most frequent complications of liver biopsy.
3)If the patient is discharged after the procedure, instruct the patient to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity for one week.

\section*{Complication}
i. Fever
ii. Pain, swelling, redness or discharge around needle insertion site
iii. Chest pains
iv. Shortness of breathing
v. Fainting or dizziness- sign of possible blood loss
vi. Nausea and vomiting
vii. Worsening abdominal pains - bleeding, leakage of bile

- Prepare the client for a feeling of pressure with the needle insertion and fluid removal.

\section*{Nursing care (intra)}
-Monitor the client's vital signs, skin color, and oxygen saturation throughout the procedure.
-Measure and record the amount of fluid removed from the client's chest.
- Label the specimens at the bedside and promptly send them to the laboratory.
NB: the amount of fluid removed is limited to 1 litre at a time to prevent cardiovascular collanse

\section*{Nursing care cont...}

Post procedure
- Apply a dressing over the puncture site and position the client on the unaffected side for one hour.
- Monitor the client's vital signs and respiratory status hourly for the first several hours after the procedure.
* Encourage the client to deep breathe to help in lung expansion.

iv. Infection
v. Pulmonary oedema. (after sudden shift in mediastinal contents when large amounts of fluids are aspirated)

\section*{Abdominal Paracentesis}

\section*{ABDOMINAL PARACENTESIS/ ABDOMINAL TAPPING}
* This is the puncture of the abdomen and the withdrawal of fluid that has collected in the peritoneal cavity.
- The fluid build up is called ascites
- It relieves abdominal pressure and obtains specimen for laboratory analysis.

\section*{Indications}
i. To find the cause of ascites
ii. To diagnose infection in peritoneal fluid
iii. To check for certain types of cancer E.g liver cancer
iv. To remove large amounts of fluid that causes pain or difficulty in breathing or that affects kidney or bowel(intestine) functioning.

\section*{contraindications}
- Mild hematologic abnormalities do not increase the risk of bleeding
The risk of bleeding may be increased if:
- prothrombin time>21 seconds
- international normalized ratio > 1.6
-platelet count<50,000 per cubic millimeter.
Absolute contraindication is acute abdomen that requires surgery

\section*{Relative contraindications are:}
i. Pregnancy

\section*{Nursing action post procedure}

Check rate of drainage and adjust to the required rate of flow
$\square$ Return patient to bed or to a comfortable sitting position
Measure, describe and record the fluid collected
aLabel samples of fluid and send them to lab
$\square$ Monitor vital signs every 25 minutes for 1 hr , every 30 minutes for 2 hrs , every hour for 2 hrs and then every 4hrs

\section*{Nursing care(post procedure)}

NOTE:
$\square \mathrm{BP}$ and pulse may change as fluid shift occurs after removal of fluid.
$\square$ An elevated temperature is a sign of infection
$\square$ Assess for hypovolemia, electrolyte shifts, changes in mental status and encephalopathy which may occur with removal of fluid and fluid shifts and should be reported.
$\square$ Check puncture site for leakage or bleeding, leakage of fluid may occur because of changes in abdominal pressure and may contribute to further loss of fluid if undetected

Nursing care cont (post)...
Provide patient teaching regarding:
i. Need to monitor for bleeding or excessive drainage from puncture site.
ii. Importance of avoiding heavy lifting or straining.
iii. Need to change position slowly iv. Frequency of monitoring for fever

\section*{Ascitic fluid analysis}

The serum-ascites albumin gradient can help determine the cause of the ascites.

\section*{- Lumbar puncture}

\section*{LUMBAR PUNCTURE(SPINAL TAP)}
-
Procedure performed to obtain information about cerebrospinal fluid(CSF).
- It can be diagnostic (to rule out bacterial meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage) or therapeutic(E.g. treatment of pseudo tumor cerebri by relieving increased intracranial pressure)

\section*{Role of a nurse cont....}

\section*{After procedure:}
- Apply brief pressure to puncture site: using a bandage to avoid bleeding
- Position: place patient on a flat bed: for 4 to 6 hours, do not elevate the head.
- Monitor vitals, neurologic status, input \& output: every 4 hours
- Monitor puncture site for CSF leakage and drainage of blood: signs include positional headache, nausea and vomiting, neck stiffness, photophobia, imbalance, tinnitus\& phonophobia (sensitivity to sound)
- Encourage increased fluid intake: up to 3000 mls in 24 hours to replace drawn CSF
- Label and number specimen tube correctly and send to the lab
* Analgesia: administer as ordered due to headaches after procedure

\section*{CSF tubes}
- Different institutions have different protocols for the studies sent from the various CSF tubes. Classically, CSF tubes 1-4 are sent for the following studies:

1 - Cell count and differential
2 - Glucose and protein levels
3 - Gram stain, culture and sensitivity (C\&S)
4 - When indicated, viral titer or cultures, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, Cryptococcus antigen, India ink stain, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level, or other studies.

\section*{Abnormal findings:}
$\square$ Pressure:
- Increased ICP as a result of tumor, hemorrhage, hypo-osmolality resulting from hemodialysis, or TB-meningitis or trauma induced edema
- Decreased ICP: may reveal spinal subarachnoid obstruction, leakage of spinal fluid, severe dehydration, hyper osmolality, or circulatory collapse
$\square$ Appearance:
- Cloudy appearance=infection
- Yellow to reddish- spinal cord obstruction or intracranial hemorrhage.
* Brown to orange- increased protein levels or RBC breakdown.

\section*{Abnormal findings cont....}

CSF protein:
- Increased protein-tumor, trauma, Dmor blood in CSF.
- Decreased protein- rapid CSF production.

Gamma globulin:
- Increased Gg- demyelinating diseases e.g.multiple sclerosis, neurosyphilis or Guillan-Barre syndrome.
CSF glucose:
-Increased-hyperglycemia
Decreased-hypoglycemia, bacterial or fungal infection, TB or meningitis

\section*{Abnormal findings cont....}

\section*{CSF cell count:}

Increased WBC- meningitis, tumor, abscess, acute infection, stroke, demyelinating disease.
-RBC in CSF- bleeding into spinal fluid or result of traumatic lumbar puncture.
CSF chloride:
Decreased- infected meninges
Gram stain:
Gram positive or negative organism indicates bacterial infection.

\section*{Complications}
A. Post lumbar puncture headache:
- Due to leakage of CSF and reduction in the brain, it's the most frequent complication in $11-25 \%$ of patients.
*It may be mild or severe(throbbing frontal or occipital).
- It may occur a few hours later or after several days.
- It's severe when the patient stands and reduces when they lie down.
- Management:
$\checkmark$ Bed rest
$\checkmark$ Analgesics
$\checkmark$ Hydration with liberal administration of fluids especially those that contain caffeine E.g. coffee, tea, some sodas

\section*{Prevention of leakage}
- Needle with a small gauge should be used for puncture
Patient should remain prone for 3hrs, If larger amounts of CSF has been withdrawn(more than 20 mls ) then the patient should lie:
Prone for 2hrs
Lateral for 2 hrs
Prone or supine for 6 hrs

\section*{Complications cont....}
B)Herniation of cranial contents
C)Abscesses : collection of pus in tissues causing swelling and inflammation around it.
D) Hematomas : localized collection of blood within tissues
E)Meningitis
F) Back pain: trauma to soft tissue

-Patients concerns
*Adverse reactions (continued bladder spasms, decreased total urine output)

\section*{CHOLECYSTOGRAM/CHOLECTO GRAPHY}
*This is an x-ray procedure used to help evaluate gall bladder.
* For the procedure, a special contrast media is given in form of tablets which are swallowed to help visualize the gall bladder on x-ray.
* The test helps diagnose disorders of the liver and gall bladder including tumors and gall stones
Contrast media used:
- It's oral and it's given according to the manufacturer's instructions. They include:
- Orablix
- Telepaque
- Biloptin

\section*{Procedure preparation}

Contrast media is given the evening before, ensure it's not vomited(usually 6 tablets and shouldn't drink anything there after)
- An enema is given the night before to clear gas and faeces
- A day before test give fatty meal, evening give low fat meals

\section*{Procedure}

When contrast media tablets are given they are absorbed from intestines into the blood stream, removed from blood by liver, and excreted by liver into the bile.

The contrast media together with the bile is highly concentrated in the gall bladder, contrast media outlines the gall stones that are radiolucent(x-ray pass through them), and that are usually invisible on standard xray
- Bile ducts themselves can not be seen on the x-ray in oral cholecystogram (OCG) because the contrast media is not concentrated on the ducts, therefore , any gallstones lodged in the ducts will go undetected on OCG
- Depending on how well the contrast dye is absorbed, polyps and tumors may also be visible on x-ray film.

\section*{Note}

Due to development of improved technology, cholecystogram is no longer performed routinely, ultrasound and CT scan are faster and often more accurate in diagnosing conditions of the gall bladder
Gall stones are usually seen as dark spots on x-ray films
After procedure care
- Advise patient to drink a lot of water to flush out the dye from their system

\section*{CHOLANGIOGRAPHY}
- Cholangiography is the imaging of the bile duct (also known as the biliary tree) by x-rays. There are at least two kinds of cholangiography:
1. Percutaneous Trans-hepatic Cholangiography (PTC): Examination of liver and bile ducts by x-rays. This is accomplished by the insertion of a thin needle into the liver carrying a contrast medium to help to see blockage in liver and bile ducts.

\section*{2. Endoscopic Retrograde Choledochography (ERC).}
*This primarily examines the larger bile ducts within the liver and the bile ducts outside the liver
The contrast media is given intravenously
The procedure is used is to locate gall stones within the bile ducts and identify other causes of obstruction to the flow of bile. E.g strictures of bile ducts and cancers that may impair normal flow of bile

\section*{Procedure}

To do an intravenous cholangiogram, an iodine containing dye is injected intravenously into the blood
The dye is removed from the blood by the liver which excretes it into bile.
The dye is concentrated enough just as it's secreted into the bile that it does not need to be further concentrated by the gall bladder in order to outline bile ducts and any gall stones that may form within them.
several x-rays (radiographs) are taken as the liver excretes the dye

\section*{ERCP}
- Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancretography (ERCP) is a technique that combines the use of endoscopy and fluoroscopy(x-ray beams are used to show continuous image on a monitor) to diagnose and treat certain problems of the biliary or pancreatic ductal systems.
* Through the endoscope, the physician can see the inside of the stomach and duodenum, and inject dyes into the ducts in the biliary tree and pancreas so they can be seen on x-rays.
- ERCP is used primarily to diagnose and treat conditions of the bile ducts, including gallstones, inflammatory strictures (scars), leaks (from trauma and surgery), and cancer.
ERCP can be performed for diagnostic and therapeutic reasons, although the development of safer and relatively noninvasive investigations such as magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic ultrasound has meant that ERCP is now rarely performed without therapeutic intent.

\section*{Diagnostic indications}
* Obstructive jaundice - This may be due to several causes
- Chronic pancreatitis - a now controversial indication due to widespread availability of safer diagnostic modalities including endoscopic ultrasound, high-resolution CT, and MRI/MRCP
- Gallstones with dilated bile ducts on ultrasonography
- Bile duct tumors
- Suspected injury to bile ducts either as a result of trauma or iatrogenic
- Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction
- Pancreatic tumors no longer represent a valid diagnostic indication for ERCP unless they cause bile duct obstruction and jaundice. Endoscopic ultrasound represents a safer and more accurate diagnostic alternative

\section*{Therapeutic indications}
- Any of the above when the following may become necessary
- Endoscopic sphincterotomy (both of the biliary and the pancreatic sphincters)
- Removal of stones
- Insertion of stent(s)
- Dilation of strictures (e.g. primary sclerosing cholangitis, anastomotic strictures after liver transplantation)

\section*{Contraindications}
-Recent attack of acute pancreatitis, within the past several weeks.
-Recent myocardial infarction.
-Inadequate surgical back-up
* History of contrast dye anaphylaxis
-Poor health condition for surgery.
-Severe cardiopulmonary disease.

\section*{complications}
* The major risk of an ERCP is the development of pancreatitis which can occur in up to $5 \%$ of all procedures.
- Gut perforation is a risk of any endoscopic procedure, and is an additional risk if a sphincterotomy is performed. As the second part of the duodenum is anatomically in a retroperitoneal location (that is, behind the peritoneal structures of the abdomen), perforations due to sphincterotomies are also retroperitoneal.
- Bleeding.
- Oversedation can result in dangerously low blood pressure, respiratory depression, nausea, and vomiting.
- There is also a risk associated with the contrast dye in patients who are allergic to compounds containing iodine.

\section*{Retrograde pyelograghy}
- Is a radiologic technique of examining strictures of the collecting system of the kidney
- A radio opaque contrast medium is injected through a urinary catheter into the ureter and the calyces of the pelvis of the kidney using cytoscope
Indications
- Incases where IVP provides inadequate visualization
- Before extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy(to break kidney stones)
- Identification of filling defects E.g. kidney stones and tumors
* During replacement of ureteral stents

Contraindication
Presence of infected urine
Pregnancy
- Allergy to contrast media

Complications
- Infection
- Perforation of ureter
haematuria

\section*{Myelogram/myelography}

This is a radiologic examination that uses contrast medium to detect pathology of the spinal cord, including location of spinal cord injury, cysts and tumors
The procedure involves injection of radio opaque dye into cervical or lumbar spine followed by several xray projection
A myelogram may help find the cause of nain not found hy an MRI or CT

\section*{Indications}

The cause of leg or arm numbness, weakness or pain
Narrowing of the spinal canal(spinal stenosis)
Tumor or infection causing problems with the spinal cord or nerve roots
A spinal disc that has ruptured (herniated disc)
Inflammation of the membrane covering the brain and spinal cord
Problems with blood vessels to the spine

\section*{Pre procedure care}

Explain the procedure to the patient
- Obtain a signed consent
- Starve the patient before the procedure for the prescribed time
- Remove dentures and metal ornaments or objects
Procedure
Patient lies prone on the x-ray table with lower extremities tightly secured with straps to the table
Skin area is infiltrated with local anaesthesia, dye is then injected into the spinal sac, then the table is slowly rotated into circular motion

First down at the head end for 4-6 minutes then rotated up at the head end for the same duration
Several more minutes the process is completed. This movement ensures the contrast has sufficiently worked it's way through the spinal cord, followed by x-rays, CT or MRI scans
If the dye introduced in spinal tap was oil based, the physician conducting the procedure will remove it after the procedure. If water based dye is used it's not removed as it is eventually absorbed by

Post procedure care
Patient should be in recumbent position
for 24 hrs with head raised
Observe for neurologic signs especially headache as a result of CSF leakage
Encourage the patient to increase fluid intake to enhance dye excretion
Instruct the patient to avoid strenuous activities and heavy lifting at least a day after test

ENDOSCOPY

\section*{ENDOSCOPY}
- This is the use of a hollow instrument to look inside the body cavities or organs. It uses flexible tube that has a small (camera)on the end of it.
*The instrument is referred to as an endoscope
- An endoscope is passed through a natural body opening or via a small incision. For example a laparoscope is inserted through small surgical incision in the pelvic or abdominal area
- If an ultra-sound probe is added to endoscope E.g. GIT endoscope this is called endoscopic ultrasound

\section*{Anoscopy/proctoscopy}

\section*{Procedure}
- Explain the procedure to the patient
Put the patient in knee chest position with feet beyond the edge of the bed, knees apart to give support, head resting on the couch, fore arms on either side of the head and hands placed one on top of the other above the head
The patient is told of the progress, the possibility he might feel like
- Suction may be done to remove secretions
- Biopsy may be taken
- Polyps may be removed and the area cauterized to prevent bleeding
The tissue removed is placed on moist gauze and then in the appropriate container, labeled, and sent to the pathology lab with the request form.
- After each use the tubes are washed thoroughly
- Disposable tubes should be disposed safely

\section*{Colonoscopy \& Sigmoidoscopy}

\section*{Colonoscopy/ sigmoidoscopy}

This is endoscopic examination of the large bowel and distal part of the small bowel with an endoscope passed through the anus.(colonoscope)
The colonoscope has a small camera attached to a flexible tube that can reach and examine the entire length of the colon.

\section*{Indications}

Diagnostic:
Colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, GIT haemorrhage, ulceration, polyps, and removal of biopsy; changes in bowel habit(unexplained).
Prophylactic:
- Removal of polyps

Therapeutic:
- Removal of foreign bodies

Screening:
- Every 10yrs from 50yrs for colorectal cancer

\section*{Patient preparation}
- Explain the procedure to the patient
- Starve the patient of solid foods for $\underline{3}$ days to empty the GIT
- Laxatives are given for two days

On day of examination an enema is given until rectum is clear
Narcotic analgesic may be ordered and administered
Diazepam is given to sedate the patient

\section*{Procedure}

Sigmoidoscopy; position the patient in knee chest
Colonoscopy; the patient lies on left side with legs drawn up
The first step is usually a digital rectal examination to examine the tone of the anal sphincter and to determine if the preparation is adequate
Patient is sedated, the endoscope is then passed through the anus up the rectum and colon(sigmoid, descending, transverse, and ascending colon, the caecum) and ultimately the terminal ileum

The bowel is occasionally inflated with air to maximize visibility(procedure that may give false sensation of need to have a bowel movement)
- Biopsies are then taken for histology or examination and diagnostic evaluation of colon is done.

\section*{Post procedure care}
- Advise the patient to refrain from operating heavy machinery until a day after the procedure
- The patient resumes other normal activities after effects of sedation wear off E.g. eating and drinking normally
- Advise patient to report signs of, chills, fever, rectal bleeding(more than a tablespoon) swelling or redness at IV site or severe abdominal pain or bloating
- Mild abdominal pain and bloating is expected after the procedure
Complications
Perforation
Haemorrhage
Inflammation of the bowel

\section*{다stoscopy}

\section*{Cystoscopy}
- This is endoscopy of the urinary bladder via the urethra
- A cytoscope is used
- Diagnostic cystoscopy is carried out using local anaesthesia, GA is sometimes used for operative cystoscopic procedures.
*To enable clear visualization, sterile irrigation solution is instilled to distend the bladder and wash away

\section*{Indications}

Urinary tract infections
To assess the ureter and kidney pelvis
Haematuria
Incontinence( loss of bladder control)
Unusual cells found in urine sample
To remove renal calculi(kidney stones)
Urinary blockage E.g. prostate enlargement and stricture
Unusual growth, polyp, tumor or cancer and obtain biopsy

Patient preparation
- Explain the procedure to the patient
- Patient may take 1-2 glasses of water (or as instructed) before going for the examination
They should not urinate for a sufficient period of time, such that they are able to urinate prior to the procedure
Procedure
$\checkmark$ Patient lies on their back(supine) with their knees slightly apart, they may also need to flex their knees especially when doing rigid cystoscopy examination.
For flexible cystoscopy , local anaesthesia is used Local anaesthesia is applied directly from a tube or needleless syringe into the urinary tract

The doctor gently inserts the tip of the cytoscope into the urethra and slowly guide it up the bladder
The procedure is more painful for men than women due to length and narrow diameter of the male urethra, relaxing pelvic muscles helps ease this pain
A sterile liquid(water, saline, glycine solution) will flow through the cytoscope to slowly fill the bladder and stretch it so that there is a better and clear view of the bladder wall
The procedure takes 15-20 minutes
Flexible cystoscopy(just to look inside the bladder), Rigid cystoscopy(if you need treatment for a problem in the bladder).

After procedure care
Relief of expected discomfort i.e burning and frequency of micturation by encouraging patient to increase oral fluid intake
Warm bath or compresses also relieves the burning feeling
Incase of blood tinged urine -relieve this by application of moist heat to the lower abdomen
Warm sitz bath are also recommended for urinary retention from edema
An indwelling catheter may have to be incerted

\section*{COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY}

\section*{Computed tomography}

Computed tomography (or computerized axial tomography) is an examination that uses X-ray and computer to obtain a cross-sectional image of the human body.

\section*{Computed tomography}
* When X-rays are irradiated on the human body, some of the rays are absorbed and some pass through the body to produce an image.
- In plain X-ray imaging, the film directly absorbs penetrated X-rays. In CAT scanning, an electronic device called a "detector array" absorbs the penetrated X-rays, measures the X-ray amount, and transmits the data to a computer system.
- A sophisticated computer system, in turn, calculates and analyzes data from each detector in each level, and finally reconstructs multiple, two-dimensional, cross-sectional images.

\section*{MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI)}

\section*{MRI}

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an imaging technique used primarily in medical settings to produce high quality images of the soft tissues of the human body.
$\square$ It is based on the principles of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), a spectroscopic technique to obtain microscopic chemical and physical information about molecules
$\square$ MRI has advanced beyond a tomographic imaging technique to a volume imaging technique

\section*{WHAT CAN BE DIAGNOSED BY AN MRI SCAN?}
- Most ailments of the brain, including tumours
- Sport injuries
- Musculoskeletal problems
- Most spinal conditions/injuries
- Vascular abnormalities
- Female pelvic problems
- Prostate problems
- Some gastrointestinal tract conditions
- Certain ear, nose and throat (ENT) conditions
- Soft tissue and bone pathology/conditions

\section*{Niranjan Ultrasound India pvt.Ltd}

\section*{WHO CAN'T HAVE AN MRI SCAN?}
- A cardiac pacemaker
- Certain clips in your head from brain operations
- A cochlear implant
- A metallic foreign body in your eye
- Had surgery in the last 8 weeks
- If you are pregnant

\section*{PRINCIPLE}
- MRI makes use of the magnetic properties of certain atomic nuclei.
- Hydrogen nucleus (single proton) present in water molecules, and therefore in all body tissues.
- The hydrogen nuclei partially aligned by a strong magnetic field in the scanner.

\section*{CONTI..}
- The nuclei can be rotated using radio waves, and they subsequently oscillate in the magnetic field while returning to equilibrium.
- Simultaneously they emit a radio signal.
- This is detected using antennas (coils)
- Very detailed images can be made of soft tissues.

\section*{ADVANTAGES OF MRI}
- No ionizing radiation
- Variable thickness in any plane
- Better contrast resolution
- Many details without iv contrast

\section*{DISADVANTAGES OF MRI}
- Very expensive
- Dangerous for patients with metallic devices placed within the body
- Difficult to be performed on claustrophobic patients
- Movement during scanning may cause blurry images
- RF transmitters can cause severe burns if mishandled

ELECTRO-
ENCEPHALOGRAM(EEG)
- Is a non invasive procedure that assesses the electrical activity of the brain.
*The brain's spontaneous electrical activity is recorded over a short period of time, 20-40 minutes from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp
*The electrodes are connected to wires then a machine which records electrical impulses, the results are printed out or displayed on a computer monitor
- Different patterns of electrical impulses can denote various form of neurological problems E.g. epilepsy

\section*{Indications}
$\checkmark$ Evaluation of brain disorders
$\checkmark$ Determine brain death
$\checkmark$ To determine whether to wean off antiepileptic medications

\section*{NOTE}
most EEG show the type and location of the activity in the brain during a seizure thus evaluates people with problems associated with brain function E.g. confusion, coma, tumors, long term difficulties with thinking or memory, or weakness of specific parts of the body like in coma

Used to prove if some one on life support machine has no chance of recovery

\section*{Patient preparation}

Head is shaved or patient avoids hair styling products on the day of exam
Tranquilizers and stimulants are with held for 24-48 hours
Drinks that are stimulants are also withheld E.g. coffee, tea, cola etc.

Explain the procedure to the patient i.e. takes 45-60 minutes, doesn't cause electric shock, it's a test not a form of treatment

\section*{Procedure}
- Patient lies on the table, about 16-20 electrodes are attached to the scalp with a conductive gel or paste
- Each electrode is attached to an individual wire
- Electrode location and names are specified by the international 10-20 system
The patient is asked to relax, lies with eyes open, then later with eyes closed
The patient may be asked to breath deeply and rapidly or stare at a flashing light, these activities produces changes in the brain wave patterns.
If being evaluated for sleep disorder, EEG may be performed continuously through out the night when the patent is sleeping.

The brain's electrical activity is recorded continuously through out the exam on special EEG paper.
EEG results are interpreted by a neurologist After procedure care

Instruct the patient when to resume medications especially anti-seizure medications that had been with held
Patient doesn't require recovery time but instruct them to report to hospital if;
Number of seizures increase
An altered mental status
Having new loss of function

\section*{ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY(ECG)}
- Is a test that records the electrical activity of the heart, it's used to detect and locate the source of heart problems
-It shows the heart rate, rhythm and records the strength and timing of the electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart
Purpose
- Measure the rate and regularity of the heart beats
- Size and position of the heart chambers
- Presence of any damage to the heart
- Effects of drugs or devices used to regulate the heart E.g pacemaker

\section*{Indications}
- Symptoms of myocardial infarction
- Symptoms of pulmonary embolism
- Cardiac murmurs
- Syncope or collapse
- Seizures
- Perceived cardiac dysrhythmias
- Assessing patients with systemic diseases
- Monitoring during anaesthesia and critically ill patients

Patient preparation
- Explain the procedure to the patient
- Patient should avoid exercising or taking cold water immediately before ECG as this may give false results
- Shaving hair where electrode will attach Procedure
- The technician attaches 12 soft patches called electrodes to the skin on the chest arms and legs
- The patient lies still on the table in supine position while electrodes detect the electrical signals of the heart
- A machine then records these signals on graph paper or displays them on the monitor
- Entire test takes about 10 minutes , after the test the electrodes are removed from the skin and discarded.
- Graph is interpreted and diagnosis established.

\section*{COLOSTOMY CARE}

\section*{THE PERSON WITH AN OSTOWY}

An Ostomy is the surgical creation of an artificial opening

The opening is called a stoma
A colostomy is the surgical creation of an artificial opening between the colon and the abdominal wall

An ileostomy is a surgically created opening between the small intestine and the abdominal wall

\section*{POST-OPERATIVE NURSING CARE}

Skin Care: Access skin for sign of irritation or breakdown; apply skin barrier paste.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_18_85f0e78d7d9f84ae103ag-194.jpg?height=853&width=1309&top_left_y=739&top_left_x=637)

Psychosocial Adaptation: The nurse should help the patient to accept the colostomy and teach patient the necessary care and management.
Nutrition: the colostomate is started on a light, low-residue diet (Patel, 2012).
Patient Education: provide written, verbal and psychomotor instruction on colostomy care, pouch management, skin care and irrigation for the client.

Medications: Some medications or nutritional supplements may change the color, odor, or consistency of stool just like before surgery. Patient education and postmedication observation are therefore necessary.

Control of Odor: control odor by a clean odor free, well-fitting appliance; regular change of bag, cleaning, and use of deodorant.

Applying an ostomy appliance: The stoma must be measured so that the right size appliance can be chosen. The pouch attaches over the stoma and is fastened unto the faceplate.

\section*{To empty ostomy pouch}

\section*{Catheter sizes}

Catheters are available in both different sizes and lengths
- Variation in length is due to the difference in length of the male and female urethra
- Male catheters are $41-45 \mathrm{~cm}$ in length
-Female catheters are $20-25 \mathrm{~cm}$ in length

\section*{Cont. sizes}
- The size is the diameter of the internal lumen of the catheter and is measured in Charriere (Ch) named after its French inventor
The most common sizes are $10 \mathrm{~F}(3.3 \mathrm{~mm})$ to $28 \mathrm{~F}(9.3 \mathrm{~mm})-\mathrm{F}$ is French catheter scale
-The nurse should select a size large enough to allow free flow of urine, and large enough to control leakage of urine around the catheter.
* A larger size is necessary when the urine is thick or bloody .

\section*{Female catheterisation}
- Remember to use the right sized catheter for the purpose it is needed for
-If anaesthetic gel is used this should be placed into the urethra 5 minutes prior to catheterisation
- Two pairs of sterile gloves should be used to avoid cross contamination when cleansing and instilling gel. The outer pair is removed after cleansing and prior to catheter insertion

\section*{Female catheterization cont.}
* If the catheter is accidentally inserted into the vagina, leave it in place to prevent it happening again
- Use a new catheter
* Once this is successfully in place remove the first catheter from the vagina

\section*{Procedure (female)}
- Explain the procedure to the patient and gain informed consent
- Take the pre prepared trolley to the bedside and place on left or right depending on nurses dominant hand
- Raise the bed to an appropriate height and ensure a good light source and position the patient
- Expose the genital area with consideration for patient dignity and place a disposable pad beneath the patient
Wash and dry hands

\section*{Procedure cont}
- Ensure asepsis is maintained and open packs and equipment onto the trolley
- Open the catheter but do not remove it from the internal wrapper and place it in the sterile receiver on the trolley
- Pour an appropriate cleanser or solution into the galipot
- Open the catheter bag and arrange it on the side of the bed, ensuring the attachment tip is accessible and remains sterile
- Squeeze small amount of lubricant or anaesthetic gel onto a gauze swab

\section*{Procedure cont.}
- Draw up the amount of sterile water to inflate the balloon
- Wash hands again and put on two pairs of sterile gloves
- Place the sterile dressing towel between the patients legs and over the patients thighs
- Using a gauze swab and the non dominant hand retract the labia minora to expose the urethral meatus. This hand is used to maintain labial separation until procedure is completed

\section*{Procedure cont.}
- Clean the perineal area using a new gauze swab for each stroke cleansing from the front towards the anus
-Place the receiver holding the catheter on the sterile towel between the patients legs
- Expose the tip of the catheter by pulling off the top of the wrapper at the serrated or notched edge
- Lubricate the catheter tip with anaesthetic or lubricating gel
* Hold the catheter so the distal end remains in the receiver

\section*{Procedure cont.}
- Gradually advance it out of the wrapper into the urethra in an upward and backward direction for approximately $5-7 \mathrm{~cm}$ or until urine flows
- Advance a further 5 cm , do not force the catheter
- Inflate the balloon with the correct amount of water
* Attach the catheter drainage bag and position so there is no pulling on the catheter

\section*{Male catheterisation}
- Ensure the patient has no history of prostatic hypertrophy
- It is important to hold the penis at 60 to 90 degrees to the body, this reduces the risk of strictures or narrowing of the urethra

\section*{Male catheterisation cont.}
*Anaesthetic lubricating jelly should be placed into the urethra and the practitioner must wait 5 minutes for this to be effective
-If the patient complains of any severe discomfort during the procedure then the procedure should be stopped immediately
-If resistance is felt increasing the traction on the penis may reduce the spasm of the external sphincter
Encouraging the patient to cough may

\section*{Procedure (male)}
- Explain the procedure to the patient and gain informed consent
Take the pre prepared trolley to the bedside and place on left or right depending on nurses dominant hand
- Raise the bed to an appropriate height and ensure a good light source
- Expose the genital area with consideration for patient dignity and place a disposable pad beneath the patient
- Wash and dry hands

\section*{Procedure (male) cont}
- Ensure asepsis is maintained and open packs and equipment onto the trolley Open the catheter but do not remove it from the internal wrapper and place it in the sterile receiver on the trolley
- Pour an appropriate cleanser into the galipot
Open the catheter bag and arrange it on the side of the bed, ensuring the attachment tip is accessible and remains sterile

\section*{Procedure (male) cont}
- Prepare the anaesthetic lubricating gel and remove end tip
- Draw up the amount of sterile water to inflate the balloon
- Wash hands again and put on two pairs of sterile gloves
- Place the sterile dressing towel between the patients legs and over the patients thighs
- Using a gauze swab and the non dominant hand retract the fore skin to expose the urethral meatus.
- Clean the area

\section*{Procedure (male) cont}
* using a new gauze swab for each stroke
* Hold the penis at 60-90 degrees to the body
* Warn the patient the anaesthetic gel may sting and instil the gel via the urethral meatus
* Place a finger over the meatus and hold penis at same angle for 5 minutes to allow the gel to work
- Place the receiver holding the catheter on the sterile towel between the patients legs

\section*{Procedure (male) cont}
- Expose the tip of the catheter by pulling off the top of the wrapper at the serrated edge
* Hold the catheter so the distal end remains in the receiver
- Gradually advance it out of the wrapper into the urethra until urine flows
- Advance a further 5 cm , do not force the catheter
- Inflate the balloon with the correct amount of water
- Attach the catheter drainage bag and position so there is no pulling on the catheter

\section*{Points for consideration}

Catheter valves can be used instead of urine drainage bags for bladder training purposes
*Catheter retention balloons should not be over filled so as to avoid urinary bypassing
*Leg bags can be used in mobile patients
*Following male catheterisation always roll the fore skin back over the glans penis to prevent a paraphimosis occurring-(foreskin cannot return to its position)

\section*{Complications associated with urethral catheterisation}
- Urinary tract infection
- Urethral injury
- Encrustation and blockage
- Bypassing -leakage of urine
- Patient discomfort

\section*{Intermittent self}

\section*{catheterisation}
- This refers to the periodic insertion of a catheter through the urethra to empty urine from the bladder
- Procedure is commonly used by patients requiring intravesical(to the bladder) medication instillation, or patients with neurogenic(nerves) voiding problems
- Self lubricating PVC or silicone catheters are often used for the procedure

Procedure has several advantages over urethral catheterisation:
Allows more patient independence
Decreased impact upon patient body image
Less discomfort
Can allow the patient to continue with their sexual relationships

\section*{Suprapubic catheterisation}
-Procedure involves insertion of specially designed catheter into the bladder via the abdominal wall
-Procedure is performed under either local or general anaesthesia

\section*{Indications}
Urinary retention or voiding problems caused by prostatic obstruction or infection
Urethral stricture
When urethral catheterisation is not possible
If trauma present to pelvis or urinary tract
Patients undergoing surgery to pelvis or urinary tract

\section*{Contraindications}
\%Patients with haematuria
*Known bladder tumour
*Small fibrotic bladders
*Prosthetic devices in the lower abdomen

\section*{Risk factors of procedure}
- Bowel perforation/ haemorrhage at cystostomy formation
- Cystostomy complications, e.g. localised infection
- Pain, discomfort, irritation
- Urethral leakage especially in females

\section*{Procedure}
- Surgical procedure performed in some hospitals by urology clinical nurse specialists
- Local or general anaesthesia
- Cystostomy (surgical opening) is formed between internal bladder and external abdominal wall
- Specially designed self retaining catheter is inserted which forms a complete seal
- Catheter is connected to urine drainage bag as normal

\section*{Conclusion}

Catheterisation is a commonly performed procedure in clinical practice
- Urethral catheterisation of both male and female patients is a nursing procedure
- The nurse needs an awareness of the anatomy and physiology of the urinary system
-The steps of the procedure including the rationale and potential complications

\section*{Conclusion}
- Patients who perform intermittent self catheterisation require good health education
* The nurse needs a good awareness of the procedure to promote this health education
- Suprapubic catheters may also be used but performed as a minor surgical procedure possibly by a urology clinical nurse specialist or doctor

\section*{SPECIAL PROCEDURES}

\section*{TUBE THORACOSTOMY (CHEST TUBE)}

\section*{Definition:}
$\circledast$ It is the insertion of a tube into the pleural space through a small incision.

\section*{Indications:}
es Chest tube insertion and drainage is commonly used:
1. For spontaneous or traumatic pneumthorax involving > 25\% collapse or enlargement, especially if it causes respiratory distress or a serious gas exchange abnormality;
2. For massive or recurrent benign pleural effusions not responding to thoracentesis;
3. For empyema;
4. For hemothorax; and
5. For malignant effusions (before intrapleural chemotherapy and/or sclerosing agents are used and briefly afterward, to drain the weeping pleura).
Sometimes, loculated empyemas (Pus in a body cavity) are effectively treated by instilling fibrinalytic agents into the pleural space through the chest tube, thus avaiding surgical lysis of the loculations
es In patients with clatting abnormalities, tube thoracostomy drainage may be necessary for the above indications, but special care must be taken.

\section*{Procedure:}
es For pneumothorax, the tube is usually inserted in the anterior 2nd or 3rd intercostal space at the middlavicular line and is directed toward the apex of the lung.
es For pleural effusions and ather fluids in the thorax, the tube is inserted in the midaxillary line of the 5th ar Eth intercostal space and is directed posteriorly.
es Tubes for loculated effusions or empyemas are positioned as required.
es Lidocaine is used as for thoracentesis
es A purse-string suture is made around the skin incision.
es After the subcutaneous tissue and intercastal muscles are separated with a clamp down to the parietal pleura, the tube is introduced through the parietal pleura, preferably with a clamp grasping the tip.
es The tip is introduced into the pleural space and directed as described above.
es The purse-string suture is closed, and the tube is sutured to the chest wall.
* The tube is connected to simple underwater drainage (for effusions or empyema) or placed in line with a negative suction pump.
es In some cases, pneumothoraces can be reinflated without suction using a one-way Heimlich valve.
es A chest $x$-ray is obtained after tube insertion to check the tube's position and function.
$\approx$ When the situation resolves, the tube is removed.
es If pneumnthorax was the reason for insertion, the tube is clamped for several hours before removal, and before the tube is removed, a chest $x$-ray is abtained to verify that the pleural leak has stopped.
es For patients receiving ventilatory support with positive pressure, the tube is often left in place until weaning is accomplished.
© More than one chest tube is sometimes required.
es For pleural effusions, a small-bore chest tube or pigtail catheter is usually placed and fluid is removed by negative suction until the drainage is under IDImL per 24 hours and the lung has expanded

\section*{Complications:}
es Include hemorrhage from intercostal vessel injury,
es Subcutaneous emphysema.
$\approx$ Injury due to a malpositioned tube (e.g. into the major fissure, and occasionally into the lung), and
es Local infection or pain
© Reexpansion pulmnary edema due to increased capillary permeability may occur in the reexpanded lung, especially after prolonged lung collapse and rapid reinflation.
es Tube insertion may be difficult because of adhesions or a very thick pleura
© Dther problems include inadequate drainage of the pleural space due to clats or gelatinous inflammatory material and plugging or kinking of the tube.

\section*{THORACOTOMY}

\section*{Definition:}
es Incision through the chest wall into the pleural space.

\section*{Indications}
es Thoracotomy for open biopsy of lung, pleura, hilum, and mediastinum is the diagnostic gold standard to which all ather procedures must be compared.
ex Exploratory thoracotomy is required in < 1 \% of cases to establish the diagnosis and resectability of lung cancer.
es Thoracotomy is most helpful in patients with undiagnosed focal or diffuse pulmunary problems, in which definitive diagnosis is likely to improve the management plan.
$\approx$ It is used in patients with pulmonary problems of unknown etiology when less invasive procedures have not yielded a diagnosis or when ather procedures are more dangerous or unlikely to yield a diagnosis.
© An emergent thoracotomy may be necessary to repair a traumatic aortic disruption

\section*{Contraindications:}
es Include unstable systemic status (e.g. cardiopulmnnary, nutritional, metabolic, renal), i.e. inability to tolerate the injury of major surgery.

\section*{Procedure:}
© Three basic approaches are used.
\& Each requires a general anesthetic in an operating room.
1. In limited anterior or lateral thoracotomy, a G - to 8 -cm intercostal incision is made; after a large tidal volume, the lung is papped out to be biopsied through the incision. When this approach is used to diagnose diffuse interstitial lung disease, localized peripheral lung disease, or infectious diseases in immunosuppressed hosts, morbidity and martality are very law. Patients require a chest tube for 24 to 48 h and can often leave the hospital in 3 to 4 days.
2. Full wide incision thoracotomy gives access to pleura, hilum, mediastinum, and the entire lung. It is most useful when a neoplasm is suspected or when multiple sites in one lung require biopsy.
3. Median sternotomy is used when lesions in both lungs require biopsy.

\section*{Complications}
es Are greater than those for any other pulmonary biopsy procedure because of the risks of general anesthesia, surgical trauma, and a longer hospitalization with more postoperative discomfort.
© Hemarrhage, infection, pneumothorax, bronchopleural fistula, and reactions to anesthetics are the greatest hazards.
