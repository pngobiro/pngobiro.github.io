                            <li>Patients throat maybe sprayed with local anaesthesia to help prevent discomfort, or they gargle local anaesthetic agent for mouth and throat or IV diazepam 5-10 mg is given just before the procedure</li>

                        <p>Local anaesthesia is sprayed in mouth or throat or sedation is done. Endoscope is then passed smoothly and slowly in the areas being examined. The procedure takes 10-20 minutes. The doctor may inject moderate amount of air to expand the stomach allowing better visualization. Biopsy is taken for examination or images of the digestive tract are taken for documentation of any abnormality; esophageal varices can be banded, resecting or ablating mucosal tissue.</p>

                        <p>The patient should take only clear oral fluids and not to consume any food for at least 24 hrs before the exam. Laxatives and enemas may be required before the start of exam to clear the lower bowel.</p>

                            <li>The patient is told of the progress, the possibility he might feel like he needs to defecate</li>
                            <li>Suction may be done to remove secretions</li>
                            <li>Biopsy may be taken</li>
                            <li>Polyps may be removed and the area cauterized to prevent bleeding</li>
                            <li>The tissue removed is placed on moist gauze and then in the appropriate container, labeled, and sent to the pathology lab with the request form.</li>
                            <li>After each use the tubes are washed thoroughly</li>
                            <li>Disposable tubes should be disposed safely</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Colonoscopy & Sigmoidoscopy</h4>
                        <p>This is endoscopic examination of the large bowel and distal part of the small bowel with an endoscope passed through the anus.(colonoscope)</p>
                        <p>The colonoscope has a small camera attached to a flexible tube that can reach and examine the entire length of the colon.</p>
                        <h4>Indications</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Diagnostic:</strong> Colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, GIT haemorrhage, ulceration, polyps, and removal of biopsy; changes in bowel habit(unexplained).</li>
                            <li><strong>Prophylactic:</strong> Removal of polyps</li>
                            <li><strong>Therapeutic:</strong> Removal of foreign bodies</li>
                            <li><strong>Screening:</strong> Every 10yrs from 50yrs for colorectal cancer</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Patient preparation</h4>

                            <li>Explain the procedure to the patient</li>
                            <li>Starve the patient of solid foods for 3 days to empty the GIT</li>
                            <li>Laxatives are given for two days</li>
                            <li>On day of examination an enema is given until rectum is clear</li>
                            <li>Narcotic analgesic may be ordered and administered</li>
                            <li>Diazepam is given to sedate the patient</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Procedure</h4>
                        <p>Sigmoidoscopy; position the patient in knee chest</p>
                        <p>Colonoscopy; the patient lies on left side with legs drawn up</p>
                        <p>The first step is usually a digital rectal examination to examine the tone of the anal sphincter and to determine if the preparation is adequate</p>
                        <p>Patient is sedated, the endoscope is then passed through the anus up the rectum and colon(sigmoid, descending, transverse, and ascending colon, the caecum) and ultimately the terminal ileum</p>
                        <p>The bowel is occasionally inflated with air to maximize visibility(procedure that may give false sensation of need to have a bowel movement)</p>
                        <p>Biopsies are then taken for histology or examination and diagnostic evaluation of colon is done.</p>
                        <h4>Post procedure care</h4>

                            <li>The patient resumes other normal activities after effects of sedation wear off E.g. eating and drinking normally</li>
                            <li>Advise patient to report signs of, chills, fever, rectal bleeding(more than a tablespoon) swelling or redness at IV site or severe abdominal pain or bloating</li>
                            <li>Mild abdominal pain and bloating is expected after the procedure</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>This is endoscopy of the urinary bladder via the urethra</p>
                        <p>A cytoscope is used</p>
                        <p>Diagnostic cystoscopy is carried out using local anaesthesia, GA is sometimes used for operative cystoscopic procedures.</p>
                        <p>To enable clear visualization, sterile irrigation solution is instilled to distend the bladder and wash away debris.</p>
                        <h4>Indications</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Urinary tract infections</li>

                            <li>To remove renal calculi(kidney stones)</li>
                            <li>Urinary blockage E.g. prostate enlargement and stricture</li>
                            <li>Unusual growth, polyp, tumor or cancer and obtain biopsy</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Patient preparation</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Explain the procedure to the patient</li>
                            <li>Patient may take 1-2 glasses of water (or as instructed) before going for the examination</li>
                            <li>They should not urinate for a sufficient period of time, such that they are able to urinate prior to the procedure</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Procedure</h4>
                        <p>Patient lies on their back(supine) with their knees slightly apart, they may also need to flex their knees especially when doing rigid cystoscopy examination. For flexible cystoscopy , local anaesthesia is used. Local anaesthesia is applied directly from a tube or needleless syringe into the urinary tract. The doctor gently inserts the tip of the cytoscope into the urethra and slowly guide it up the bladder. The procedure is more painful for men than women due to length and narrow diameter of the male urethra, relaxing pelvic muscles helps ease this pain. A sterile liquid(water, saline, glycine solution) will flow through the cytoscope to slowly fill the bladder and stretch it so that there is a better and clear view of the bladder wall. The procedure takes 15-20 minutes. Flexible cystoscopy is used just to look inside the bladder, Rigid cystoscopy is used if you need treatment for a problem in the bladder.</p>
                        <h4>After procedure care</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Relief of expected discomfort i.e burning and frequency of micturation by encouraging patient to increase oral fluid intake</li>
                            <li>Warm bath or compresses also relieves the burning feeling</li>
                            <li>Incase of blood tinged urine -relieve this by application of moist heat to the lower abdomen</li>
                            <li>Warm sitz bath are also recommended for urinary retention from edema</li>
                            <li>An indwelling catheter may have to be incerted</li>
                        </ul>
