                        <p>This is an x-ray procedure used to help evaluate gall bladder.</p>
                        <p>For the procedure, a special contrast media is given in form of tablets which are swallowed to help visualize the gall bladder on x-ray.</p>
                        <p>The test helps diagnose disorders of the liver and gall bladder including tumors and gall stones</p>
                        <h3>Contrast media used:</h3>
                        <p>It's oral and it's given according to the manufacturer's instructions. They include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Orablix</li>
                            <li>Telepaque</li>
                            <li>Biloptin</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Procedure preparation</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Contrast media is given the evening before, ensure it's not vomited(usually 6 tablets and shouldn't drink anything there after)</li>
                            <li>An enema is given the night before to clear gas and faeces</li>
                            <li>A day before test give fatty meal, evening give low fat meals</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Procedure</h3>
                        <p>When contrast media tablets are given they are absorbed from intestines into the blood stream, removed from blood by liver, and excreted by liver into the bile.</p>
                        <p>The contrast media together with the bile is highly concentrated in the gall bladder, contrast media outlines the gall stones that are radiolucent(x-ray pass through them), and that are usually invisible on standard xray</p>
                        <p>Bile ducts themselves can not be seen on the x-ray in oral cholecystogram (OCG) because the contrast media is not concentrated on the ducts, therefore , any gallstones lodged in the ducts will go undetected on OCG</p>
                        <p>Depending on how well the contrast dye is absorbed, polyps and tumors may also be visible on x-ray film.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Note</h3>
                        <p>Due to development of improved technology, cholecystogram is no longer performed routinely, ultrasound and CT scan are faster and often more accurate in diagnosing conditions of the gall bladder. Gall stones are usually seen as dark spots on x-ray films.</p>
                        
                        <h3>After procedure care</h3>
                        <p>Advise patient to drink a lot of water to flush out the dye from their system</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Cholangiography is the imaging of the bile duct (also known as the biliary tree) by x-rays. There are at least two kinds of cholangiography:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Percutaneous Trans-hepatic Cholangiography (PTC):</strong> Examination of liver and bile ducts by x-rays. This is accomplished by the insertion of a thin needle into the liver carrying a contrast medium to help to see blockage in liver and bile ducts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Endoscopic Retrograde Choledochography (ERC).</strong> This primarily examines the larger bile ducts within the liver and the bile ducts outside the liver</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The contrast media is given intravenously. The procedure is used to locate gall stones within the bile ducts and identify other causes of obstruction to the flow of bile. E.g strictures of bile ducts and cancers that may impair normal flow of bile</p>

                        <h3>Procedure</h3>
                        <p>To do an intravenous cholangiogram, an iodine containing dye is injected intravenously into the blood. The dye is removed from the blood by the liver which excretes it into bile. The dye is concentrated enough just as it's secreted into the bile that it does not need to be further concentrated by the gall bladder in order to outline bile ducts and any gall stones that may form within them. several x-rays (radiographs) are taken as the liver excretes the dye</p>
                        
                        <h3>ERCP</h3>
                        <p>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancretography (ERCP) is a technique that combines the use of endoscopy and fluoroscopy(x-ray beams are used to show continuous image on a monitor) to diagnose and treat certain problems of the biliary or pancreatic ductal systems.</p>
                        <p>Through the endoscope, the physician can see the inside of the stomach and duodenum, and inject dyes into the ducts in the biliary tree and pancreas so they can be seen on x-rays.</p>
                        <p>ERCP is used primarily to diagnose and treat conditions of the bile ducts, including gallstones, inflammatory strictures (scars), leaks (from trauma and surgery), and cancer.

</figure> ERCP can be performed for diagnostic and therapeutic reasons, although the development of safer and relatively noninvasive investigations such as magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic ultrasound has meant that ERCP is now rarely performed without therapeutic intent.</p>

                        <h4>Diagnostic indications</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Obstructive jaundice - This may be due to several causes</li>
                            <li>Chronic pancreatitis - a now controversial indication due to widespread availability of safer diagnostic modalities including endoscopic ultrasound, high-resolution CT, and MRI/MRCP</li>
                            <li>Gallstones with dilated bile ducts on ultrasonography</li>
                            <li>Bile duct tumors</li>
                            <li>Suspected injury to bile ducts either as a result of trauma or iatrogenic</li>
                            <li>Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction</li>
                            <li>Pancreatic tumors no longer represent a valid diagnostic indication for ERCP unless they cause bile duct obstruction and jaundice. Endoscopic ultrasound represents a safer and more accurate diagnostic alternative</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Therapeutic indications</h4>
                        <p>Any of the above when the following may become necessary</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Endoscopic sphincterotomy (both of the biliary and the pancreatic sphincters)</li>
                            <li>Removal of stones</li>
                            <li>Insertion of stent(s)</li>
                            <li>Dilation of strictures (e.g. primary sclerosing cholangitis, anastomotic strictures after liver transplantation)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Contraindications</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Recent attack of acute pancreatitis, within the past several weeks.</li>
                            <li>Recent myocardial infarction.</li>
                            <li>Inadequate surgical back-up</li>
                            <li>History of contrast dye anaphylaxis</li>
                            <li>Poor health condition for surgery.</li>
                            <li>Severe cardiopulmonary disease.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Complications</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The major risk of an ERCP is the development of pancreatitis which can occur in up to 5% of all procedures.</li>
                            <li>Gut perforation is a risk of any endoscopic procedure, and is an additional risk if a sphincterotomy is performed. As the second part of the duodenum is anatomically in a retroperitoneal location (that is, behind the peritoneal structures of the abdomen), perforations due to sphincterotomies are also retroperitoneal.</li>
                            <li>Bleeding.</li>
                            <li>Oversedation can result in dangerously low blood pressure, respiratory depression, nausea, and vomiting.</li>
                            <li>There is also a risk associated with the contrast dye in patients who are allergic to compounds containing iodine.</li>

                        <p>Patient lies prone on the x-ray table with lower extremities tightly secured with straps to the table. Skin area is infiltrated with local anaesthesia, dye is then injected into the spinal sac, then the table is slowly rotated into circular motion. First down at the head end for 4-6 minutes then rotated up at the head end for the same duration. Several more minutes the process is completed. This movement ensures the contrast has sufficiently worked it's way through the spinal cord, followed by x-rays, CT or MRI scans. If the dye introduced in spinal tap was oil based, the physician conducting the procedure will remove it after the procedure. If water based dye is used it's not removed as it is eventually absorbed by the body.</p>
                        <h4>Post procedure care</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patient should be in recumbent position for 24 hrs with head raised</li>
                            <li>Observe for neurologic signs especially headache as a result of CSF leakage</li>
                            <li>Encourage the patient to increase fluid intake to enhance dye excretion</li>
