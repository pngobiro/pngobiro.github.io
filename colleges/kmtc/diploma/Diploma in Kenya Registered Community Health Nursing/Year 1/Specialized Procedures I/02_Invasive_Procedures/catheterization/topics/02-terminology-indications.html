                        <p>A catheter is a thin hollow flexible tube which can be inserted in the bladder either through the urethra (urethral) or suprapubic channel to drain the urine.</p>

                        <p>Transurethral indwelling catheterisation or urinary catheterisation is defined as passage of a catheter into the urinary bladder via the urethra (urethral catheter). MeSH term [4] (Fig. 1 and 2). Transurethral indwelling catheterisation is also called urethral catheterisation. In this document we only use the term urethral catheterisation.</p>
                        <p>Suprapubic catheterisation is the insertion of a catheter into the bladder via the anterior abdominal wall. (Fig. 3 and 4)</p>

                        <p>What is called short-term or long-term use in catheterisation depends on the indication. For practical reasons this guideline considers a short-term catheter to remain in situ for no longer than 14 days. [5]</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, long-term catheters remain in situ for a period exceeding 14 days, usually because of urinary retention secondary to disease conditions. [5]</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3.3 Closed drainage system</h3>
                        <p>A closed catheter drainage system is an aseptic system in which the path from the tip of the catheter inserted into the bladder, to the bag which catches urine, is closed and should not be disconnected. This in order to eliminate inoculation of the urinary tract with bacteria via the catheter drainage tubing and from the collection bag. [6]</p>
                        <p>The term 'closed drainage' is, however, not strictly accurate as there are numerous portals of entry for pathogens and the system must be opened to allow emptying and be disconnected when the drainage bag is changed.</p>

                        <p>An indwelling catheter should only be placed when there is a clear indication. It should not stay in place longer than necessary. It is important first to consider alternatives before placing an indwelling catheter; a catheter is the last resort when other options have failed or proved to be insufficient. To insert a catheter only for the comfort of the nursing staff is irresponsible.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Acute and chronic urine retention that is not able to be adequately drained with a urethral catheter. [23, 24, 28, 32, 33, 34]</li>
                            <li>Preferred by patient due to patient needs e.g. wheelchair user, sexual issues. [9, 24]</li>
                            <li>Acute prostatitis. [23, 28]</li>
                            <li>Obstruction, stricture, abnormal urethral anatomy. [23]</li>
                            <li>Pelvic trauma. [23, 24]</li>
                            <li>Complications of long-term urethral catheterisation. [23]</li>
                            <li>When long-term catheterisation is used to manage incontinence. [23]</li>
                            <li>Complex urethral or abdominal surgery. [23]</li>
                            <li>Faecally incontinent patients who are constantly soiling urethral catheter. [23]</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4.6 Contraindications for suprapubic catheterisation</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Known or suspected carcinoma of the bladder. [12, 23, 24, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]</li>
                            <li>Suprapubic catheterisation is absolutely contraindicated in the absence of an easily palpable or ultrasonographically localised distended urinary bladder. [12, 23, 24, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]</li>
                            <li>Previous lower abdominal surgery. [24, 32, 35]</li>
                            <li>Coagulopathy (until the abnormality is corrected). [12, 24, 32]</li>
                            <li>Ascites. [24, 32]</li>
                            <li>Prosthetic devices in lower abdomen e.g. hernia mesh. [23, 32, 41]</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4.7 Advantages of suprapubic catheterisation</h3>
                        <p>There is little evidence-based research on the use of suprapubic catheters. However, experts believe that there may be several advantages to their use when compared with urethral catheterisation:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Less risk of urethral trauma, necrosis, or catheter-induced urethritis. [12, 23, 24, 32, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 43]</li>
                            <li>Reduced risk of catheter contamination with micro-organisms commonly found in the bowel. [12, 24, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44]</li>
                            <li>Greater comfort, particularly for patients who are chair bound. [12, 23, 24, 32, 36, 37, 38, 42, 44, 40]</li>
                            <li>Easier access to the entry site for cleansing and catheter change. [12, 23, 24, 32, 36, 37, 39]</li>
                            <li>More appropriate in respect to a person's sexual activity (intercourse). [23, 24, 32, 37]</li>
                            <li>Can be blocked off and the ability to void urethral assessed prior to removal of the suprapubic catheter. [12, 23, 24, 32, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 43, 44]</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Limitations of suprapubic catheters:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Insertion is an invasive procedure with the risk of bleeding and visceral injury. [45]</li>
                            <li>The patient may still leak urine via the urethra. [45]</li>
                            <li>Specialised training may be required for healthcare professionals and carers for the changing of a suprapubic catheter. [45]</li>
                            <li>Patients with artificial heart valves may require antibiotic therapy prior to initial insertion or routine catheter change; however this will depend on local healthcare management policy.</li>
                            <li>Patients on anticoagulant therapy will require their coagulation levels checking prior to insertion of a suprapubic catheter. Anticoagulant therapy and coagulations levels will depend on local healthcare management policy.</li>
