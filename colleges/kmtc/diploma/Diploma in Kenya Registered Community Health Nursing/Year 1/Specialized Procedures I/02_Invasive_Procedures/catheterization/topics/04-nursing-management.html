                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">6.1 Patient preparation</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Consent</h4>
                        <p>Catheterisation is an invasive procedure that can cause embarrassment, physical and psychological discomfort and impact on the patient's self-image. To ensure the patient is fully prepared for catheterisation it is the responsibility of the health care professional to inform the patient of the reasons and necessity for the procedure, and obtain the patient's permission. [61] In many areas of medicine, patients are required to sign a consent form that indicates agreement for the practitioner to undertake a procedure. It also implies an understanding of the event and the associated potential complications/problems. At present it is not common practice within Europe for patients to provide written consent for catheterisation; it is however a necessity that verbal consent and agreement is reached and the relevant information is recorded in the patient's medical and/or nursing notes. [62]</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Information and support</h4>
                        <p>Explaining the procedure and providing the reason for catheterisation to the patient will help reduce patient anxiety and embarrassment and help the patient to report any problems that may occur while the catheter is in-situ. [63] Relaxing the patient by offering reassurance and support will help for smoother insertion of the catheter and assist in avoiding unnecessary discomfort and the potential of urethral trauma during the insertion. [64, 65]</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Equipment and preparation</h4>
                        <p>Even if catheterisation is a medical order, the health care professional should take a brief medical patient history, especially about urological conditions before the procedure.</p>
                        <p>Catheterisation is a sterile procedure as it involves instrumentation of a sterile tract. It is imperative that the health care professional has a good understanding of the principles of the aseptic procedure as this will help to reduce the risk of UTI. [66]</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Lubricating gel</h4>
                        <p>Catheterisation can be painful in both males and females. The use of anaesthetic lubricating gels is well recognised for male catheterisation. An appropriate sterile single-use syringe with lubricant should be used before catheter insertion of a non-lubricated catheter to minimise urethral trauma, discomfort and infection. [8, 33] However, it is essential to ask the patient if they have any sensitivity to lignocaine/lidocaine, chlorhexidine or latex before commencing the procedure. There have been reported cases of anaphylaxis attributed to the chlorhexidine component in lubricating gel. [67] Ten to fifteen ml of the gel is instilled directly into the urethra until this volume reaches the sphincter/bladder neck region. Blandy [68] and Colley [69] recommend a 3 to 5 minute gap before starting the catheterisation after instilling the gel, but it is important to follow manufacturer's guidance. A maximised anaesthetic effect will help the patient to relax and the insertion of the catheter should be easier. [70]</p>
                        <p>If the lubricant contains lignocaine/lidocaine or chlorhexidine, care should be taken if the patient has an open wound or severe damaged mucous membranes and/or infections in the regions where the lubricant will be used. In patients with severe disorders of the impulse conduction system or epilepsy as well as women in the first three months of pregnancy or breast feeding (Package instruction leaflets Instillagel® and Xylocaine®), the urologist should be asked permission to use a lignocaine/lidocaine containing lubricant.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Set for catheterisation</h4>
                        <p>Fixed catheter sets are widely used. Different hospitals use different sets for catheterisation (refer to local policy). There is no standard list of materials for a catheterisation set / pack. You should check individual packs for required contents, the catheter and drainage bag are usually separate from the catheterisation packs.</p>
                        <p>There is no literature on a scientific basis about the advantage or disadvantage of using such a catheter-set. Using a set could be an advantage in educational situations or in emergency situations because you only need to search for a set and the catheter with a bag and not for all single materials you need to insert a catheter.

                        <p>There are two techniques to insert a suprapubic catheter. The classic method is with the use of sterile gloves. The second method is the "no-touch technique" without sterile gloves. Instead, the sterile package of the catheter is used to touch the catheter. The no-touch technique is probably to be preferred, because there is less risk of contamination, but unfortunately there is no evidence in the literature available.</p>
                        <p>If the patient does not have a readily palpable bladder then ideally, the bladder should be filled with at least 300 ml prior to insertion of a suprapubic catheter (SPC). Ultrasonography may also be used as an adjunct to SPC insertion or with cystoscopy to ensure that the needle used to make the SPC tract can be visualised entering the bladder at an appropriate point on the anterior bladder wall.</p>
                        <p>In patients with a history of lower abdominal surgery or the bladder cannot be distended then an open procedure may have to be performed for insertion of the SPC. (LE 3) [74]</p>

                        <p>Difficulty in catheterising the patient can be caused by a variety of reasons. Medical advice and support should be sought if problems during or after the insertion occur. Complications associated with catheters include UTI, trauma and inflammatory reactions, urethral stricture, calculi, hypospadias, false route and possibly carcinoma of the bladder. [75] These can result in one or more of the following symptoms occurring: pain, bypassing, blockage, catheter expulsion and bleeding.</p>

                        <p>Routine daily personal hygiene is all that is needed to maintain meatal hygiene. [13, 76, 77, 78] Trials of various cleansing agents, e.g. chlorhexidine, saline etc., have failed to demonstrate a reduction in bacterial growth rate [79], meaning soap and water is sufficient to achieve effective meatal cleansing. [65, 80, 81] However attention must be given to educating noncircumcised patients to clean underneath their foreskin daily to remove smegma, as this may increase the patient's risk of developing a UTI in addition to causing trauma and ulceration to the meatus and glans penis. [76, 82]</p>
                        <p>There is no evidence that routine application of antimicrobial preparations around the meatus will prevent infections. [65, 81, 83]</p>

                        <p>Whichever bag is chosen, extensive measures should also be taken to maintain unobstructed flow. [16] To prevent obstruction, the catheter and collecting tube should be kept free from kinking and the collecting bag has to be kept below the level of the bladder at all times (to allow urine to drain by gravity) and must never be rested on the floor. [16] When emptying the collecting bag regularly use a separate, clean collecting container for each patient; avoid splashing, and prevent contact of the drainage spigot with the non-sterile collecting container.

                        <p>The observations relate to the indication for catheterisation. Post-operatively catheterisation is often performed to monitor urine output. The monitoring of urine output is vital to ensure that the bladder continues to empty and that excessive diuresis does not occur. [84] In home settings observations relate to common complications to long-term catheters such as blockage and infections.</p>
                        <p>For Common problems with indwelling catheter equipment, see Appendix E. For Observation of urinary drainage, see Appendix F.</p>
                        <p>Indwelling catheters with open-drainage systems result in bacteriuria in almost 100% of cases within 3-4 days. [20,55] By using closed urinary drainage systems bacteriuria cannot be prevented, but it can be delayed. Almost all patients will develop bacteriuria within approximately 4 weeks. [20] Breaking a closed drainage system to obtain urine samples therefore increases the risk of CAUTI. [85]</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">6.5.5 Stabilising of the urethral catheter</h4>
                        <p>If the catheter is not secured properly, it may migrate from its intended point of stabilisation. Stabilising urethral catheters can reduce adverse events such as dislodgment, tissue trauma, inflammation and urinary tract infection. [87, 88, 89] Urethral trauma can be caused by any catheter size or by forced insertion of the catheter. Urethral trauma should be minimised by the use of adequate lubricant and the smallest possible catheter size. [20] (LE: 1b) Inflammation and trauma may also occur when the device is unsecured. Movement-induced trauma can lead to urinary tract infection and tissue necrosis. The use of a securement device reduces both the physical and psychological trauma to the patient by decreasing the need for reinsertion. If the catheter bag becomes too heavy with urine, and it is not supported properly, the bag can pull on the catheter. This, along with catheter movement at the site of insertion, can cause discomfort and irritation to the patient. [16, 90] To avoid necrosis at the urethral penile-scrotal junction caused by prolonged catheter pressure, it is recommended to secure urinary catheters to males' abdomen. [87] The catheter has to be positioned in a soft curve towards the femur (Fig. 35) and can be fixed with a securing device, tape, velcro™ or a pocket for the bag (Fig. 36, 37, 38). Although the references are only for urethral catheterisation the same principles of stabilisation apply to suprapubic catheters. [54]</p>

                        <p>Bladder dysfunction and postoperative voiding impairment have been documented following catheterisation and these can lead to infections of the urinary tract. The intermittent clamping of the indwelling urethral catheter draining tube prior to withdrawal has been suggested on the basis that this simulates normal filling and emptying of the bladder. While clamping catheters might minimise postoperative neurogenic urinary dysfunction, it could also result in bladder infection or distension. A Cochrane review investigated the best strategies for the removal of catheters from patients with a short-term indwelling catheter. They compared clamping the indwelling urethral catheter prior to removal with free drainage. Because of poor methodological quality of the studies limited evidence is obtained from the review and it does not provide a robust base for the development of practice guidelines. [91] A review addressing short-term urinary catheter policies following urogenital surgery in adults concludes the same. A small study compared clamp-and-release policies before catheter removal versus immediate removal and found urinary tract infections were more common in the clamp-and-release group and this group took longer to return to normal bladder function. The value of clamp-and-release before catheter removal could not be assessed reliably, because of the quality of the study. [92]</p>

                        <p>The presence of an appliance for collecting urine increases patient's awareness of both odour and colour changes affecting the urine caused by some medications and food products. (Appendix G) The patient and caregiver should be told that these changes are not harmful and do not necessarily occur in all patients. Normal urine is clear, straw-coloured with almost no odour.

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Purple urine bag syndrome (PUBS)</h4>
                        <p>Purple urine bag syndrome is a rare condition and is characterised by a purple discolouration of the urine bag, appliances and various catheter tubing. The urine itself may be dark in colour and not necessarily purple. The condition appears to have a significantly higher incidence in women and chronically debilitated patients with long-term indwelling urinary catheters. [94, 95, 96] The major risk factors for PUBS are female gender, severe constipation, chronic indwelling urinary catheterisation and increased tryptophan dietary content. [94, 95] The purple colour is caused by the metabolism of tryptophan by bacteria to indole and later converted to indican in the liver. Indican passes through the kidney giving urine a purple/ blue/grey colour. [96, 97]</p>
                        <p>Although studies have shown certain factors may be present, these factors are not found consistently. [95, 98] PUBS is generally found to be harmless, but there have been case reports describing PUBS progressing to Fournier's gangrene. [99] The discolouration of the urine and the urine bag can be distressing for patient, family and healthcare workers, therefore they should be educated to manage this syndrome. [100] The incidence is reduced by avoiding constipation and proper care of the urinary catheter. [95, 98]</p>
