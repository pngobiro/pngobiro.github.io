                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">11.1 Impact of a catheter on the patient</h3>
                        <p>An indwelling urinary catheter often will be placed, at the outpatient's clinic or emergency room, in for the patient a stress situation; the patient is referred because of urinary retention. Or an indwelling catheter is the last alternative, after all other treatments have failed, for example clean intermittent catheterisation, medication, use of pads or male external catheters. The catheter can be a relieve at that moment, but as Wilde, WCON, 2003 [179] discussed, urinary catheters may be commonplace to health care professionals; wearing one may not be that easy. A patient can be faced with different kinds of problems, such as urinary catheter equipment, how to deal with sexual activities, UTI or even sepsis, emptying bags problems, catheter changes, clothing adjustments, positioning of tubing, (hand) hygiene, meatal cleansing, falling out of the catheter, odour, kinking of catheter. [48, 54, 179, 180]</p>
                        <p>The process of learning to accept the catheter was reported to take about 1 year's time in one study. [181 in 179] Also Wilde [179] discovered in her study that participants who wore the catheter longer were most accepting.</p>
                        <p>Most participants viewed their catheter in a balanced way, minimising the negative and emphasising the positive. It is a necessity to treat a medical problem related to underlying disease or injury. Statements of participants about their catheter are: 'a necessary evil', 'a part of me', 'it makes life easier for me now', 'becomes second nature'. [179, page 34-35]</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">11.2 Sexuality and body-image</h3>
                        <p>There is a lack of research how sexual intercourse is affected by catheter use. Patients with indwelling catheters can experience not only physical problems but also emotional problems. Several constraints may impair teaching/counseling about sexuality, including lack of privacy because of several caregivers in the home, insufficient information about patient's neurological status, cultural taboos, or views that chronically ill people do not have sexual needs and desires. Making adjustments in sexual activities can be a challenge for patients, require support, open communication, and sensitivity of nurses. But by not bringing up this sensitive subject, nurses put their patients in the uncomfortable position of having to introduce the topic themselves. It should be a part of the routine teaching. [179]</p>
                        <p><strong>Advice which can be given:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Discuss with patient that sexual behaviour encompasses a range of activities from caressing, kissing and masturbation to penetration of the vagina by the penis.</li>
                            <li>Patients (or partner) can be taught to remove the catheter and replace it after intercourse.</li>
                            <li>Women can tape the catheter on to the abdomen.</li>
                            <li>Men can tape the catheter along the erect penis and secure it under a male external catheter [148]</li>
                            <li>The drainage bag, once emptied, can be positioned out of the way in the bed.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively, the drainage bag can be disconnected from the catheter and a valve attached during intercourse.</li>
                            <li>A water-based lubrication can be used to facilitate insertion (oil-based lubrication can damage the catheter and rot the male external catheter).</li>
                            <li>A suprapubic catheter, whenever possible, rather than a urethral catheter should be used.</li>
                            <li>Different position during intercourse can be discussed. Of course the position should be comfortable for the patient, so he/she can relax. Some positions can cause increased traction on the catheter in females, such as a face-to-face position with the partner on top. Traction can be reduced by placing a pillow under the woman's bottom to raise the pelvis.</li>

                        <p>Wearing a catheter is often not a choice, and the experience leads to a time of embodied change, altering one's view of self within the world. [180] A lot of urological patients live with chronic illness and require ongoing care. It is generally argued that those with low levels of social support experience poorer quality of life and adjustment to illness. In some countries there are foundations for patients, such as the Bladder and Bowel Foundation in the United Kingdom or the Pelvic Floor Foundation in The Netherlands. And also on the internet there are possibilities to meet other patients.</p>

                        <p>Many patients develop special skills in observing their bodies in relation to the catheter, such as the use of their hands to check periodically for the leg bag filling, or they feel the weight on his/her leg increasing. But most participants empty the bag on a schedule very similar to most people's daily pattern. Other skills are: awareness of changes of urine flow through the catheter, checking the tube for kinks, and especially for SCI-patients: symptoms of trigger autonomic dysreflexia. [104, 179]</p>
                        <p>As Wilde, 2003 [179] state: living with a long-term indwelling catheter can be a challenge, but with support and information about the best practice, individuals can adapt to this change.</p>
                        <p>Patients and cave-givers should be provided with written and verbal information to support the following:</p>

                        <p>It is recommended that patients receive catheter packs from the hospital pharmacy or other medical suppliers, to ensure that the patient can start at home immediately. Equipment may vary, but consists mostly of a new catheter, leg bags, night bags, straps/stockinet holder, bed holder and/or a catheter valve. In case of a suprapubic catheter sometimes also a dressing may be required if secretions soil clothing, but this is not essential. [48]</p>
                        <p>Reimbursement differs in European countries as each country has its own healthcare insurance system and the personal insurance schemes also vary.</p>

                        <p>Evidence-based guidelines such as this one are useful. Caregivers can convert these guidelines into local policies and procedures. As Foulkes, 2008 [182] describes, there are still a lot of problems which patients with longterm indwelling catheters can experience. Without an ongoing catheter care protocol for patients with indwelling urinary catheters, important issues are likely to be neglected. [183]</p>
                        <p>There are different rules and experiences [184] of documentation in different countries. Written catheter care protocols are necessary to secure details of the procedure in the appropriate place. [12, 24, 65] The following issues should be recorded:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Catheter type/balloon/Ch/length</li>

                        <p>Some catheter manufacturers have printed booklets for this purpose that accompany their catheters.</p>
                        <p>Rew, 2005 [101] developed a form (catheter change record) in which the above issues are represented. Patients with long-term indwelling urethral catheters may profit from such a change record, because this may help detect and thus prevent potential problems such as encrustation.</p>
                        <p>Example Catheter change record (adapted from Rew 2005), see Appendix Q</p>
                        <p>In case of problems Mitchell, 2008 [173] developed an evidence-based long-term urinary catheter management flow chart. She reviewed the literature on evidence. As a result, for example, in this chart there is no recommendation about catheter maintenance solutions, because there is no evidence for this. It is a tool to be discussed with the patient and the clinical team on an individual patient basis. In case of blockage the literature advises to look back over at least the last 3 catheter changes (the catheter change record can be used for this).</p>
