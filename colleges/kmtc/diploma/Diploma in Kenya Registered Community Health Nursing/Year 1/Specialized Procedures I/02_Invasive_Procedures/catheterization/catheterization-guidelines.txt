\section*{Introduction}

The European Association of Urology Nurses (EAUN) was created in April 2000 to represent European urological nurses. The EAUN's underlying goal is to foster the highest standards of urological nursing care throughout Europe. With administrative, financial and advisory support from the European Association of Urology (EAU), the EAUN also encourages research and aspires to develop European standards for education and accreditation of urology nurses.

We believe that excellent healthcare goes beyond geographical boundaries. Improving current standards of urological nursing care has been top of our agenda, with the aim of directly helping our members develop or update their expertise. To fulfill this essential goal, we are publishing the latest addition to our Evidence-based Guidelines for Best Practice in Urological Health Care series, a comprehensive compilation of theoretical knowledge and practical guidelines on indwelling catheters. Although there is considerable literature on indwelling catheters, to our knowledge prior to this publication there was only limited evidence-based guidance for nurses available on this topic. The EAUN Guidelines Group believes there is a need to provide guidelines with recommendations clearly stating the level of evidence of each procedure with the aim of improving current practices and delivering a standard and reliable protocol.

In this booklet, we have included clear illustrations, extensive references and annotated procedures to help nurses to identify potential problem areas and efficiently carry out possible options for effective patient care. The working group decided to include topics such as indications and contraindications, equipment, nursing principles and interventions in the topic, catheter related care as well as instruction to patients and caregivers. We would also like to highlight the psychological and social aspects unique to the experience of patients with indwelling catheters as aspects which have a profound influence on the patient's quality of life.

With our emphasis on delivering these guidelines based on a consensus process, we intend to support nurses and practitioners who are already assessed as competent in this procedure. Although these guidelines aim to be comprehensive, effective practice can only be achieved if the nurse or practitioner has a clear and thorough knowledge of the anatomy under discussion and the necessary grasp and understanding of basic nursing principles.

This publication focuses on indwelling catheters both suprapubic and urethral. The guidelines only describe the procedure and material in adults and not for children. Furthermore, these guidelines are intended to complement, or provide support to, established clinical practice and should be used within the context of local policies and existing protocols.

This text is made available to all individual EAUN members, both electronically and in print. The full text can be accessed on the EAU website (http://www.uroweb.org/nurses/nursingguidelines/) and the EAUN website (www.eaun.uroweb.org). Hard copies can be ordered through the EAU website via the webshop (https://www.uroweb.org/publications/eaun-goodpractice/) or by e-mail (eaun@uroweb.org).

\section*{1. Role of the nurse in different countries}

The EAUN is a professional organisation of European nurses who have specialised in urological care. In Europe, there is a great variation in the education and competency of nurses in urology, with urological nurses having different activities and roles in various countries. It is therefore difficult for any guideline to fulfil all requirements. However, the EAUN Guidelines Working Group has tried to ensure that every nurse and health care professional may gain some benefit from using these guidelines.

\section*{2. Methodology}

The EAUN Guidelines Working Group for indwelling catheters have prepared this guideline document to help nurses assess the evidence-based management of catheter care and to incorporate the guidelines' recommendations into their clinical practice. These guidelines are not meant to be proscriptive, nor will adherence to these guidelines guarantee a successful outcome in all cases. Ultimately, decisions regarding care must be made on a case-by-case basis by healthcare professionals after consultation with their patients using their clinical judgement, knowledge and expertise.

The expert panel consists of a multi-disciplinary team of nurse specialists and a urologist (see 'About the authors', chapter 16). Obviously in different countries, even in different areas, titles will differ within the speciality. For the purpose of this document we will refer to all nurses who are working with indwelling catheters as nurse specialists (NS).

\subsection*{2.1 Literature search}

The information offered in this guideline was obtained through a systematic literature search and through review of current procedures undertaken in various member countries of the EAUN. All group members participated in the critical assessment of the scientific papers identified. Bibliographical databases consulted included Embase, Medline and the Cochrane library database CENTRAL. The search was based on the keywords (listed below). The question for which the references were searched was: "Is there any evidence for indwelling catheterisation for nursing interventions in different care situations such as preparation, insertion or care of indwelling catheters as well as catheter materials or complications?" Both Embase and Medline were searched using both 'Free text' and the respective thesauri MeSH and EMTREE. The time frame covered in the searches was January 2000 - September 2010. If a topic was not covered by the results of the search, earlier references were used. Additional search on bags, deflation of the balloon, valves, removal of the catheter and stabilisation was carried out by the Working Group.

Whenever possible, the Guidelines Working Group have graded treatment recommendations using a three-grade recommendation system (A to C ) and inserted levels of evidence to help
readers assess the validity of the statements made. The aim of this practice is to ensure a clear transparency between the underlying evidence and a recommendation given. This system is further described in the Tables 1 and 2. (see section 2.8)

\subsection*{2.2 Limitations of the search}

The search was performed in September 2010. In Medline and Embase the search results were limited to randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in Central to Controlled Clinical Trials and to meta-analysis and systematic reviews. In all databases, output was limited to human studies and English language publications.

\subsection*{2.4 Search results}

EAUN commissioned a company to do an initial search on catheterisation which resulted in a total of 1,086 abstracts from scientific publications. After reading the abstracts, 242 were left and full text articles of them were made available to the working group. It was a policy decision to restrict the search in this way, though the group were aware that more complex strategies were possible, and would be encouraged in the context of a formal systematic review. In the process of working with the articles new references were found and added to the reference list, if they were relevant for the topic and cited in the text. Additionally, scientific articles mentioned by the reviewers in November 2011 and considered useful by the working group, were included.

\subsection*{2.5 Disclosures}

The EAUN Guidelines Working Group members have provided disclosure statements of all relationships that might be a potential source of conflict of interest. The information has been stored in the EAU database. This Guidelines document was developed with the financial support of the EAU.

The EAUN is a non-profit organisation and funding is limited to administrative assistance and travel and meeting expenses. No honoraria or other reimbursements have been provided.

\subsection*{2.6 Limitations of document}

The EAUN acknowledge and accept the limitations of this document. It has to be emphasised that current guidelines provide information about the treatment of an individual patient according to a standardised approach. The information should be considered as providing recommendations without legal implications. The intended readership is the pan-European practising urology nurse and nurses working in a related field.

Cost-effectiveness considerations and non-clinical questions are best addressed locally and therefore fall outside the remit of these guidelines. Other stakeholders, except patient representatives, have not been involved in producing this document.

\subsection*{2.7 Review process}

The Working Group included an extensive number of topics, which are not always only applicable to catheterisation, but decided to include them because they make the guideline more complete. A blinded review was carried out by specialised nurses and urologists in
various countries. The Working Group revised the document based on the comments received. A final version was approved by the EAUN Board and the EAU Executive responsible for EAUN activities.

\subsection*{2.8 Rating system}

The recommendations provided in these documents are based on a rating system modified from that produced by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine. [1] Some of the literature was not easy to grade. If, however, the EAUN Working Group thought the information would be useful in practice, it is ranked as level of evidence 4 and grade of recommendation C . Low level evidence indicates that no higher level evidence was found in the literature when writing this guideline, but cannot be regarded as an indication of the importance of the topic or recommendation for daily practice.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 2: Grade of recommendation (GR)}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Grade & Type of evidence - Nature of recommendations \\
\hline A & - Based on clinical studies of good quality and consistency addressing the specific recommendations and including at least one randomised trial \\
\hline B & - Based on well-conducted clinical studies, but without randomised clinical trials \\
\hline C & - Made despite the absence of directly applicable clinical studies of good quality \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The evidence-based nursing definition from Behrens 2004 says: "Integration of the latest, highest level scientific research into the daily nursing practice, with regard to theoretical knowledge, nursing experience, the ideas of the patient and available resources". [2] There are 4 components for nursing decisions: personal clinical experience from the nurse, existing resources, patient wishes and ideas and results of nursing science. [3] This citation
states that not only the literature is relevant, but that also the experience of nurses as well as of patients is necessary for decision making. Subsequently, it is not only the written guideline that is relevant for nursing practice.

\section*{3. Terminology (definitions)}

A catheter is a thin hollow flexible tube which can be inserted in the bladder either through the urethra (urethral) or suprapubic channel to drain the urine.

\subsection*{3.1 Transurethral or suprapubic catheterisation}

Transurethral indwelling catheterisation or urinary catheterisation is defined as passage of a catheter into the urinary bladder via the urethra (urethral catheter). MeSH term [4] (Fig. 1 and 2). Transurethral indwelling catheterisation is also called urethral catheterisation. In this document we only use the term urethral catheterisation.

Suprapubic catheterisation is the insertion of a catheter into the bladder via the anterior abdominal wall. (Fig. 3 and 4)

\subsection*{3.2 Short-term or long-term catheterisation}

What is called short-term or long-term use in catheterisation depends on the indication. For practical reasons this guideline considers a short-term catheter to remain in situ for no longer than 14 days. [5]

Accordingly, long-term catheters remain in situ for a period exceeding 14 days, usually because of urinary retention secondary to disease conditions. [5]

\subsection*{3.3 Closed drainage system}

A closed catheter drainage system is an aseptic system in which the path from the tip of the catheter inserted into the bladder, to the bag which catches urine, is closed and should not be disconnected. This in order to eliminate inoculation of the urinary tract with bacteria via the catheter drainage tubing and from the collection bag. [6]

The term 'closed drainage' is, however, not strictly accurate as there are numerous portals of entry for pathogens and the system must be opened to allow emptying and be disconnected when the drainage bag is changed.

\section*{4. Alternatives, indications and contraindications}

\subsection*{4.1 Alternatives to placing an indwelling catheter}

An indwelling catheter should only be placed when there is a clear indication. It should not stay in place longer than necessary. It is important first to consider alternatives before placing an indwelling catheter; a catheter is the last resort when other options have failed or proved to be insufficient. To insert a catheter only for the comfort of the nursing staff is irresponsible.

The following alternatives to an indwelling catheter should be considered:
1. Male external catheter $[7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]$
2. Intermittent catheterisation by a nurse or family and intermittent self catheterisation by the patient $[8,12,13,15,16,17,18]$
3. Continence pad / containment product [10,15]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - Use of a male external catheter as an alternative to an indwelling urethral catheter in cooperative male patients without urinary retention or bladder outlet obstruction & 3 & B \\
\hline - In appropriate patients use of a suprapubic catheter, male external or intermittent catheter are preferable to an indwelling urethral catheter [20] & 2b & B \\
\hline - Consider other methods for management, including male external catheters or intermittent catheterisation, when appropriate [13] & 1b & A \\
\hline - Avoid use of urinary catheters in patients and nursing home residents for management of incontinence [16] & 1b & B \\
\hline - Intermittent catheterisation is preferable to indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheters in patients with bladder emptying dysfunction [16] & 1b & B \\
\hline - Intermittent catheterisation should be used in preference to an indwelling catheter if it is clinically appropriate and a practical option for the patient & 1b & A \\
\hline - There is a lower rate of infection in those with a suprapubic rather than urethral catheters despite the former being used for two weeks or longer [8, 21] & 4 & C \\
\hline - To insert a catheter only for the comfort of the nursing personnel is irresponsible & 4 & C \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{4.2 Indications for urethral catheterisation}
1. Acute and chronic urinary retention. [ $9,10,15,16,22,23,24,25,26,27$ ]
2. Maintain a continuous outflow of urine for patients with voiding difficulties, as a result of neurological disorders that cause paralysis or loss of sensation affecting urination. [9, 10, 16, 22]
3. Need for accurate measurements of urinary output in critically ill patients. [9,10,15,16, 22,23,24,25,26]
4. Perioperative use for selected surgical procedures. [9, 15, 16, 22, 23, 24]
5. Patients undergoing urological surgery or other surgery on contiguous structures of the genitourinary tract. [9, 10, 16, 23, 24, 25, 26]
6. Anticipated prolonged duration of surgery. [16,25]
7. Need for intra-operative monitoring of urinary output. [16,25]
8. To assist in healing of open sacral or perineal wounds in incontinent patients. [10,16,22, 24, 25]
9. Patient requires prolonged immobilisation (e.g. potentially unstable thoracic or lumbar spine, multiple traumatic injuries such as pelvic fractures). [16,25]
10. To allow bladder irrigation/lavage. [23,24,26]
11. To facilitate continence and maintain skin integrity (when conservative treatment methods have been unsuccessful). $[9,10,15,22,24,26]$
12. To improve comfort for end of life care if needed. [9, 10, 16, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]
13. Management of intractable incontinence. [24, 27]

\subsection*{4.3 Contraindications for urethral catheterisation}
1. Acute prostatitis [23,28]
2. Suspicion of urethral trauma [29]

\subsection*{4.4 Short-term versus long-term catheterisation}

\section*{Short-term catheterisation is mostly used:}
1. During surgical procedures and post-operative care
2. For exact monitoring of urine output in acute illness
3. For relief of acute or chronic urinary retention
4. Instillation of medication directly in the bladder

\section*{Long-term catheterisation can be necessary in:}
1. Bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), in patients who are unsuitable for surgical relief of BOO
2. Chronic retention, often as a result of neurological injury or disease where intermittent catheterisation is not possible [21]
3. Debilitated, paralysed or comatose patients in presence of skin breakdown and infected pressure ulcers - only as a last resort when alternative non-invasive approaches are unsatisfactory or unsuccessful
4. Cases where a patient insists on this form of management after discussion of the risks. [30]
5. Intractable incontinence when all other measures have been tried and proven to be ineffective. [31]
6. Intractable urinary incontinence where catheterisation enhances the patient's quality of life - only as last resort when alternative non-invasive approaches are unsatisfactory or unsuccessful.

\subsection*{4.5 Indications for suprapubic catheterisation}

In addition to the indications of the urethral catheterisation the following indications apply:
1. Acute and chronic urine retention that is not able to be adequately drained with a urethral catheter. [23,24,28,32,33,34]
2. Preferred by patient due to patient needs e.g. wheelchair user, sexual issues. [9, 24]
3. Acute prostatitis. [23, 28]
4. Obstruction, stricture, abnormal urethral anatomy. [23]
5. Pelvic trauma. [23,24]
6. Complications of long-term urethral catheterisation. [23]
7. When long-term catheterisation is used to manage incontinence. [23]
8. Complex urethral or abdominal surgery. [23]
9. Faecally incontinent patients who are constantly soiling urethral catheter. [23]

\subsection*{4.6 Contraindications for suprapubic catheterisation}
1. Known or suspected carcinoma of the bladder. [12, 23, 24, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]
2. Suprapubic catheterisation is absolutely contraindicated in the absence of an easily palpable or ultrasonographically localised distended urinary bladder. [12, 23, 24, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]
3. Previous lower abdominal surgery. [24, 32, 35]
4. Coagulopathy (until the abnormality is corrected). [12,24,32]
5. Ascites. [24, 32]
6. Prosthetic devices in lower abdomen e.g. hernia mesh. [23, 32, 41]

\subsection*{4.7 Advantages of suprapubic catheterisation}

There is little evidence-based research on the use of suprapubic catheters. However, experts believe that there may be several advantages to their use when compared with urethral catheterisation:
1. Less risk of urethral trauma, necrosis, or catheter-induced urethritis. [12, 23, 24, 32, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 43]
2. Reduced risk of catheter contamination with micro-organisms commonly found in the bowel. [12, 24, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44]
3. Greater comfort, particularly for patients who are chair bound. [12,23,24,32,36,37,38, 42, 44, 40]
4. Easier access to the entry site for cleansing and catheter change. [12, 23, 24, 32, 36, 37, 39]
5. More appropriate in respect to a person's sexual activity (intercourse). [23,24,32,37]
6. Can be blocked off and the ability to void urethral assessed prior to removal of the suprapubic catheter. [12, 23, 24, 32, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 43, 44]

\section*{Limitations of suprapubic catheters:}
1. Insertion is an invasive procedure with the risk of bleeding and visceral injury. [45]
2. The patient may still leak urine via the urethra. [45]
3. Specialised training may be required for healthcare professionals and carers for the changing of a suprapubic catheter. [45]
4. Patients with artificial heart valves may require antibiotic therapy prior to initial insertion or routine catheter change; however this will depend on local healthcare management policy.
5. Patients on anticoagulant therapy will require their coagulation levels checking prior to insertion of a suprapubic catheter. Anticoagulant therapy and coagulations levels will depend on local healthcare management policy.

\subsection*{5.1 Types of catheters}

A catheter is a thin hollow tube which can be inserted in the bladder either through the urethra or suprapubic.

\subsection*{5.1.1 One-way catheter}

The catheter has only one channel for drainage, has no balloon and is available in coated and uncoated versions. This catheter is often referred to as "straight" catheter. This type of catheter is not intended to remain in the bladder for a long period of time but is used for:
1. Intermittent catheterisation and collection of urine representative of the bladder
2. Treating urethral strictures
3. Instillation of drugs in the bladder (instillation catheter with Luer-lock)
4. Urodynamic and other investigations
5. Suprapubic catheterisation without balloon

\subsection*{5.1.2 Two-way catheter}

In 1853, Jean Francois Reybard developed the first indwelling catheter with an inflated balloon to secure its place in the bladder. One channel is used for urine and one for the balloon. (Fig. 8)

\begin{figure}

In 1932 Dr. Frederick Foley redesigned this catheter and the Foley catheter is currently the most frequently used device for management of urinary dysfunction. [46]

\subsection*{5.1.3 Three-way catheter}

Three-way catheters are available with a third channel to facilitate continuous bladder irrigation. This catheter is primarily used following urological surgery or in case of bleeding from a bladder or prostate tumour and the bladder may need continuous or intermittent irrigation to clear blood clots or debris. [47] (Fig. 9)

\subsection*{5.1.4 Catheter with integrated temperature sensor}

A silicone catheter with an integrated temperature sensor is available. (Fig.10) It is a special catheter which is sometimes used within intensive care and during certain surgical procedures. The catheter has a sensor near the tip, to measure the temperature of the urine in the bladder. This is an appropriate means of determining "deep" body or core temperature.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Fig. 10 Catheter with a temperature sensor (Source: c. Vandewinkel)}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{5.1.5 Suprapubic catheter}

The suprapubic catheter is an alternative to the urethral catheter and is inserted into the bladder surgically, often under local anaesthesia. In some countries the procedure is done by a doctor and in other countries by a clinical nurse specialist. Suprapubic catheters can be divided in different types:
1. Foley balloon catheter; similar to the one used for urethral catheterisation. (Fig. 11)
2. Catheter without a balloon; requires a suture to secure it in place. [48] (Fig. 12)
3. Foley balloon catheter with an open end. (Fig. 13)

\begin{figure}

A catheter with an open end has no "eyes" but an open end tip and is referred to as a "council" tip. This type of catheter can be used when changing a fine bore suprapubic catheter to a long-term catheter and when changing a long-term suprapubic catheter - all procedures over a guide wire.

\begin{figure}

\subsection*{5.2 Catheter material}

Catheters are available in various materials. Issues that should be considered when choosing a catheter are ease of use, tissue compatibility, allergy (latex), tendency for encrustation and formation of biofilm, comfort for the patient, e.g. [49] Some manufacturers produce catheters without phthalates and PVC-free catheters because PVC includes chlorine and plasticisers which are environmentally hazardous.

\subsection*{5.2.1 Catheters material}

\section*{Latex}

Latex, made from natural rubber is a flexible material but it has some disadvantages. Because of the potential discomfort due to high surface friction, vulnerability to rapid encrustation by mineral deposits from the urine and the implication of latex allergic reactions in the development of urethritis and urethral stricture or anaphylaxis, the use of latex catheters is restricted to short-term indwelling and commonly avoided if possible. [21]

\section*{Silicone}

The silicone catheter ( $100 \%$ silicone) is very gentle for the tissue and is hypoallergenic. Because it is uncoated it has a relatively large lumen and has a reduced tendency to encrustation.
While silicone causes less tissue irritation and potential damages, the catheter balloon has a tendency to lose fluid which increases the risk of displacement.
The silicone catheters also have a greater risk for developing a cuff when deflated which can result in uncomfortable catheter removal or urethral trauma. [50]
A Cochrane review from 2007 did not find sufficient evidence to determine the best type of indwelling urinary catheter for long-term bladder drainage in adults. [51] However, silicone catheters might be preferable to other catheter materials to reduce the risk of encrustation in long-term catheterised patients.

\section*{PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene)}

PTFE-coated latex catheters or Teflon has been developed to protect the urethra against latex. The absorption of water is reduced due to the Teflon coating. It is smoother than plain latex, which helps to prevent encrustation and irritation. Do not use this catheter for patients who are sensitive for latex. [49]

\section*{Silicone-coated/silicone elastomer-coated}

Silicone elastomer coated catheters are latex catheters coated inside and out with silicone. The catheter has the strength and flexibility of latex and the durability and reduced encrustation typical of 100\% silicone catheters. [52]

\section*{Hydrogel-coated}

Hydrogel coated catheters are soft and highly biocompatible. Because they are hydrophilic, they absorb fluid to form a soft cushion around the catheter, and reduce friction and urethral irritations. [52]

\section*{Silver-coated catheter}

One type of coating combines a thin layer of silver alloy with hydrogel which is antiseptic. Silver-hydrogel coated catheters are available in latex and silicone.
Silver alloy coated catheters significantly reduce the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, but only for less than 1 week. There is some evidence of reduced risk for symptomatic UTI. Therefore, they may be useful in some settings. [12] Another type, silver oxide coated catheters are not associated with a statistically significant reduction in bacteriuria. [21, 45]

\section*{Nitrofurazone-coated catheter}

A catheter coated with nitrofurazone is also available. Nitrofurazone should be distinguished from the medicine " Nitrofurantoin". Nitrofurazone is a bactericidal compound which is used as an antibiotic.
Antibiotic-impregnated catheters may decrease the frequency of asymptomatic bacteriuria within 1 week. According to Tenke (2008) there is, however, no evidence that antibioticimpregnated catheters decrease symptomatic infection. Therefore, they cannot be recommended routinely. [12, 45] Potential toxicity and/or antibiotic resistance using antimicrobial catheters is unknown. [21] (LE: 4)

For selection of the most suitable material the specifications of the supplier can be helpful.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - Silicone catheters ( $100 \%$ ) might be preferable to other catheter materials to reduce the risk of encrustation in long-term catheterised patients who have frequent obstruction of the catheter [16] & 1b & B \\
\hline - Catheter materials designed for long-term use ( $100 \%$ silicone, silicone coating or hydrogel coating) should be used where catheter is expected to be used long-term (more than 2 weeks) [ 21,51 ] & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Unresolved Issue} \\
\hline - Silver alloy coated catheters may reduce the risk of catheter-associated bacteriuria in hospitalised patients during short-term catheterisation (less than 1 week) [12, 53] & 1a & B \\
\hline - Antibiotic-impregnated catheters may decrease the frequency of asymptomatic bacteriuria in hospitalised patients within 1 week & 1a & B \\
\hline - There is no evidence that antibiotic-impregnated catheters decrease symptomatic infection and therefore they cannot be recommended routinely & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Unresolved Issue} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{5.2.2 Catheter diameter size and length}

Catheter diameter sizes are measured in CharriÃ¨re (Ch or CH) also know as French Gauge (F, Fr or FG) and indicate the external diameter. $1 \mathrm{~mm}=3 \mathrm{Ch}$ and the sizes range from Ch 6 to 30.

For paediatric use: size 6-10
For adults: size 10 Clear urine, no debris, no grit (encrustation)
size 12-14 Clear urine, no debris, no grit, no haematuria
size 16 Slightly cloudy urine, light haematuria with or without small clots, none or mild grit, none or mild debris.
size 18 Moderate to heavy grit, moderate to heavy debris. Haematuria with moderate clots
size 20-24 Used for heavy haematuria, need for flushing [47]
The size of the catheter is marked at the inflation channel as well as with an (international) colour code. (Fig. 15)

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_18_c8b0123a454977a9fda6g-024.jpg?height=277&width=484&top_left_y=1526&top_left_x=189}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 15 International colours of catheter size}
\end{figure}

The inner lumen of the catheter varies quite a lot between different catheter materials e.g. latex and a silicone catheter, so inserting a larger CharriÃ¨re catheter does not necessarily ensure a wider drainage channel. [48] (Fig. 16)

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_18_c8b0123a454977a9fda6g-025.jpg?height=193&width=410&top_left_y=250&top_left_x=117}

\section*{Length}

The standard male catheter length of 41-45 cm can be used for males and females, but a shorter female length of 25 cm can be more comfortable and discrete for some women. However, a female catheter can be too short if the woman is severely obese and then a male size is to prefer.
The female length catheter should not be used for males as inflation of the balloon within the urethra can result in severe trauma. Paediatric catheters are normally about 30 cm long. [21]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - Unless otherwise clinically indicated, consider using the smallest bore catheter possible consistent with good drainage, to minimise bladder neck and urethral trauma [16] & 1b & B \\
\hline - In urethral catheterisation the female length catheter should not be used for males as inflation of the balloon within the urethra will result in severe trauma. [21] Use male standard length for men in all situations & 4 & C \\
\hline - Male standard length is recommended for female patients who are bedbound, immobile, clinically obese with fat thighs, critically ill and post-operative and in emergency situations [23] & 4 & C \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{5.2.3 Tip design}

The standard tip of the catheter is round with two drainage eyes called a Nelaton catheter. (Fig. 17) For routine catheterisation, a straight-tipped catheter should be used. [52] In addition there are a variety of special catheters available on the market for specific use:

The Tiemann catheter with the curved tip is designed to negotiate the male prostatic curve and can be helpful for difficult insertions. [52]
The Tiemann indwelling catheter from hard latex for difficult catheterisation is only indicated for short-term use. (Fig. 18)

The CoudÃ© tip catheter has a curved tip just like the Tiemann catheter but has one, two or three drainage eyes situated in the curved tip.

\hline - Tiemann/CoudÃ© tipped catheters should be inserted with the tip pointed upward & 4 & C \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{5.2.4 Balloon size and filling}

When the catheter has been placed in the bladder the balloon can be inflated. (Fig. 2) Sterile water or sodium chloride can be used for latex catheters. Inflation of silicone catheters with water can sometimes lead to water loss from the balloon over time, with an associated risk of the catheter falling out. Some manufacturers recommend filling the balloon with a $10 \%$ aqueous glycerin solution. [21] Apart from the manufacturers' recommendations there are no studies available about water contra glycerin in the balloon. Some catheter manufacturers provide sterile pre-filled syringes with sterile water or glycerine $10 \%$ inside the packing.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 20 Silicone Tiemann catheter with deflated and inflated balloon (Source: T. Schwennesen)}
\end{figure}

The balloon size is indicated at the catheter connection behind the size of the catheter as a minimum and maximum ml or $\mathrm{cc}\left(\mathrm{cm}_{3}\right)$ e.g. Ch $12 / 10-15 \mathrm{ml}$.

Balloon size in adult catheters: $\quad 5-15 \mathrm{ml}, 10 \mathrm{ml}$ for standard use.
Balloon size in haematuria catheters: $15-30 \mathrm{ml}$.
The 30 ml balloon is designed specifically as a haemostat post urological procedure, and should not be used for routine catheterisation. [54]

The purpose of the retention balloon is to keep the catheter in place in the bladder. The use of a larger balloon size is mistakenly believed to be a solution to bypassing of urine. [48]

Under- or over inflation can cause occlusion of drainage eyes, irritate the bladder wall, and lead to bladder spasms. [52]
Furthermore, larger balloons tend to sit higher in the bladder with potential for increased residual urine volumes to collect below the catheter eyes. [21]
Always inflate the balloon according to the manufacturer's recommended volume at the packaging and at the inflation valve. [52]

Some manufacturers have catheters with an integrated balloon, which means that the balloon is at the same level as the catheter when it is deflated. It can be an advantage when removing a catheter with encrustations, because the encrustations are gathered around the deflated balloon cuff.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - Always inflate the balloon according to the manufacturer's instructions & 4 & C \\
\hline - The 30 ml balloon is designed specifically as a haemostat post urological procedure, and should not be used for routine catheterisation & 4 & C \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{5.3 Drainage bags}

\subsection*{5.3.1 Closed drainage system}

When the catheter has been inserted using aseptic technique, it is directly connected to the sterile bag, because an aseptic closed drainage system minimises the risk of catheterassociated urinary tract infections (CAUTI). [55] Unnecessary disconnection of a closed drainage system should be avoided, but if it occurs the catheter and collecting system have to be replaced using aseptic technique and sterile equipment. [16]

There are several different bags available; selection of the bag depends on whether it is for short-term drainage at the hospital or for long-term use, the patient's mobility, cognitive function, daily life etc. The bags can have a variety of special features:

Pre-connected drainage systems are available in which the drainage bag is already connected to a drainage bag in a sterile pack and a tamper-evident seal protects the connection. The
use of urinary systems with pre-connected, sealed catheter-tubing junctions may reduce the occurrence of disconnection. [16] (Fig. 21)

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_18_c8b0123a454977a9fda6g-028.jpg?height=429&width=583&top_left_y=205&top_left_x=189}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 21 Pre-connected drainage system (Source: c. Vandewinkel)}
\end{figure}

Anti-reflux valve drainage bags are designed with either an anti-reflux valve or anti-reflux chamber to prevent reflux of contaminated urine from the bag into the tubing. [52] However, complex urinary drainage systems (utilising mechanisms for reducing bacterial entry such as antiseptic-release cartridges in the drain port) are not necessary for routine use. [16]

Sampling port: most drainage bags have a special sampling port designed to obtain urine specimens while maintaining a closed system. (Fig. 22) Some companies produce bags with a needle-free sampling port to avoid sharp injury.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_18_c8b0123a454977a9fda6g-028.jpg?height=439&width=601&top_left_y=1100&top_left_x=193}

\subsection*{5.3.2 Leg bag / body worn bag}

If the patient is mobile a leg bag can be preferable. The leg bags allow maximum freedom and movement and can be concealed beneath the clothes.
Leg bags are available in different sizes, designs and qualities and it is important to select a bag according to the patient's preference, patient mobility and the intended duration. (Fig. 23)

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_18_c8b0123a454977a9fda6g-029.jpg?height=470&width=689&top_left_y=92&top_left_x=113}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 23 Different types of leg bags (Source: T. Schwennesen)}
\end{figure}

Capacity: ranges from 120 to 800 ml and the size depends on how often the bag has to be emptied according to the patient's daily routines.
Chamber: the bags are available with a single or several chambers. Several chambers flatten the bags profile and are therefore more discreet.
Materials: bags are produced in different materials with different backings and comfort. Some of the bags are PVC-free as well.
Tube: ranges from about 4 cm to 45 cm and some can have an individual length by cutting the tube. In addition some tubes are kinking-free, which reduces the risk for obstruction.
Suspension system: leg bags can be attached to the leg with straps (elasticated), nets, bags/ pocket of cotton, etc. (Fig. 24, 25, 26)

Outlet tap: are available in different designs; barrel tap, lever tap and push-pull tap. [48] It is important to choose a bag with a tap the patient can manage especially in patients with reduced hand function. (Fig. 27, 28)

(Please note that the bag is being held above the level of the bladder for photographic purposes only)

Another discreet bag which allows mobility is the body-worn bag as for example the Belly bagÂ® (Fig. 29). The bag can be used with either a suprapubic, a urethral or a nephrostomy catheter, but is not intended to be used with a male external catheter (condom or urosheath) in males. An anti-reflux valve behind the catheter port prevents reflux urine flow, which allows positioning this bag above the level of the bladder, contrary to other bags.

\subsection*{5.3.3 Large capacity bag}

Large capacity bags ( $2-4$ litres) can be used post-operatively, if the patient is confined to bed or if the use of a leg bag is not appropriate. Some of the bags with a large capacity are provided with an urimeter which allows accurate measurement of urine in the intensive care patient.

Different outlet taps and tube lengths are available as for leg bags (see 5.3.2).

\section*{Overnight / bedside bag}

The large capacity bags can be used as a night bag as well. Patients normally require a 2 litre drainage bag that is connected to the leg bag at night or if they are immobile / bedbound. The outlet tap on the leg bag is left open so that the urine collects in the larger bag without breaking the closed drainage system. [56] (Fig. 30)
The night bag requires a stand for support, to reduce the risk of dislodging the link system and is available in different designs and materials. [48] (Fig. 31)

\subsection*{5.3.4 Single use urinary bag}

Over the last few years, technique has changed from sterile to clean in home care setting. In some countries clean, single-use non-drainable night bags are used which means that when the bag is full it has to be changed since the bag cannot be emptied. In other countries, night bags are cleaned and reused for long-term catheters at home. More research is needed to ensure that guidelines and resultant care are based on existing evidence rather than on custom and common practice. [57]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - A closed drainage system should be maintained to reduce risk of catheter-associated infection [16] & 1b & B \\

\subsection*{5.4 Catheter valves}

Valves are small devices connected to the catheter outlet instead of a bag and are available in a variety of designs. (Fig. 32)

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_18_c8b0123a454977a9fda6g-033.jpg?height=467&width=624&top_left_y=1239&top_left_x=113}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 32 Different catheter valves (Source: T. Schwennesen)}
\end{figure}

The catheter valves are an alternative to leg bags/body-worn bags which give the patient more freedom to move and more discreet drainage. Most valves are designed to fit with linked systems so it is possible to connect to a drainage bag. For example in the night-time, for journeys, etc. [48]
The valves provide a well-accepted system of bladder emptying for suitable patients who are able to manipulate the valve mechanism and empty the bladder regularly to avoid overfilling. Another advantage is that the valve offers the potential for maintenance of bladder function, capacity and tone by allowing the filling and emptying of the bladder. [21] Furthermore, research has shown that using a catheter valve with a two to four-hourly release has been associated with reduced catheter blockage. [58] The valve is not an optimal solution for all patients and the nurse specialist has to assess the suitability for each patient. However, in some countries the use of catheter valves is not approved.

The catheter valve is contraindicated in a patient with:
1. Severe cognitive impairment (the patient must be able to recognise the need to empty the bladder through sensation or on a timed schedule)
2. Overactive bladder syndrome; might cause urinary leakage
3. Urethral reflux or renal impairment
4. Small or limited bladder capacity; the valve would have to be opened very often
5. Urinary tract infection
6. Poor manual dexterity
[59]

\subsection*{5.5 Catheter securement devices}

Catheter securement devices are designed to prevent excessive traction of the catheter against the bladder neck or inadvertent catheter removal. There are different kinds of securement devices such as tape, Velcro ${ }^{\text {TM }}$. (Fig. 33, 34)

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_18_c8b0123a454977a9fda6g-035.jpg?height=395&width=1147&top_left_y=322&top_left_x=119}

\end{figure}

For more information about catheter securement see 6.5.5 Stabilising of the urethral catheter.

\subsection*{5.6 Lubricating gel}

The lubricant dilates and lubricates the urethra. The lubricant does not need to be antiseptic [60] or anaesthetic.

Four types of lubricants can be distinguished:
1. Water soluble lubricants
2. Water soluble lubricants with chlorhexidine (antiseptic)
3. Water soluble lubricants with anaesthetic lignocaine/lidocaine
4. Water soluble lubricants with anaesthetic lignocaine/lidocaine and chlorhexidine

\section*{6. Principles of management of nursing intervention}

\subsection*{6.1 Patient preparation}

\section*{Consent}

Catheterisation is an invasive procedure that can cause embarrassment, physical and psychological discomfort and impact on the patient's self-image. To ensure the patient is fully prepared for catheterisation it is the responsibility of the health care professional to inform the patient of the reasons and necessity for the procedure, and obtain the patient's permission. [61] In many areas of medicine, patients are required to sign a consent form that indicates agreement for the practitioner to undertake a procedure. It also implies an understanding of the event and the associated potential complications/problems. At present it is not common practice within Europe for patients to provide written consent for catheterisation; it is however a necessity that verbal consent and agreement is reached and the relevant information is recorded in the patient's medical and/or nursing notes. [62]

\section*{Information and support}

Explaining the procedure and providing the reason for catheterisation to the patient will help reduce patient anxiety and embarrassment and help the patient to report any problems that may occur while the catheter is in-situ. [63] Relaxing the patient by offering reassurance and support will help for smoother insertion of the catheter and assist in avoiding unnecessary discomfort and the potential of urethral trauma during the insertion. [64, 65]

\section*{Equipment and preparation}

Even if catheterisation is a medical order, the health care professional should take a brief medical patient history, especially about urological conditions before the procedure.

Catheterisation is a sterile procedure as it involves instrumentation of a sterile tract. It is imperative that the health care professional has a good understanding of the principles of the aseptic procedure as this will help to reduce the risk of UTI. [66]

\section*{Lubricating gel}

Catheterisation can be painful in both males and females. The use of anaesthetic lubricating gels is well recognised for male catheterisation. An appropriate sterile single-use syringe with lubricant should be used before catheter insertion of a non-lubricated catheter to minimise urethral trauma, discomfort and infection. [8, 33] However, it is essential to ask the patient if they have any sensitivity to lignocaine/lidocaine, chlorhexidine or latex before commencing the procedure. There have been reported cases of anaphylaxis attributed to the chlorhexidine component in lubricating gel. [67] Ten to fifteen ml of the gel is instilled directly into the urethra until this volume reaches the sphincter/bladder neck region. Blandy [68] and Colley [69] recommend a 3 to 5 minute gap before starting the catheterisation after instilling the gel, but it is important to follow manufacturer's guidance. A maximised anaesthetic effect will help the patient to relax and the insertion of the catheter should be easier. [70]

If the lubricant contains lignocaine/lidocaine or chlorhexidine, care should be taken if the patient has an open wound or severe damaged mucous membranes and/or infections in the regions where the lubricant will be used. In patients with severe disorders of the impulse conduction system or epilepsy as well as women in the first three months of pregnancy or breast feeding (Package instruction leaflets InstillagelÂ® and XylocaineÂ®), the urologist should be asked permission to use a lignocaine/lidocaine containing lubricant.

\section*{Set for catheterisation}

Fixed catheter sets are widely used. Different hospitals use different sets for catheterisation (refer to local policy). There is no standard list of materials for a catheterisation set / pack. You should check individual packs for required contents, the catheter and drainage bag are usually separate from the catheterisation packs.

There is no literature on a scientific basis about the advantage or disadvantage of using such a catheter-set. Using a set could be an advantage in educational situations or in emergency situations because you only need to search for a set and the catheter with a bag and not for all single materials you need to insert a catheter. [33]

\subsection*{6.2 Urethral catheter - female and male insertion procedure}

\section*{For practical guidelines on how to insert a male or a female urethral catheter see Appendix $B$ and $C$.}

The recommendations below are for catheterisation in males; recommendations with an * are also relevant for females.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - If resistance is felt at the external sphincter, increase the traction on the penis slightly and apply steady, gentle pressure on the catheter. Ask the patient to strain gently as if passing urine & 4 & C \\
\hline - In case of inability to negotiate the catheter past the U-shaped bulbar urethra use a curved tip (Tiemann) catheter or hold the penis in an upright position to straighten out the curves & 4 & C \\
\hline - Special catheters like Tiemann e.g., need a special technique and should be attempted by those with experience and training [65, 71, 72, 73] & 4 & C \\
\hline - Inserting a Tiemann tip, the tip has to point upward in the 12 o'clock position to facilitate passage around the prostate gland [52] & 4 & C \\

\hline - Routine use of antiseptic lubricants for inserting the catheter is not necessary [16] * & 4 & C \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
* Recommendation also relevant for females

\subsection*{6.3 Suprapubic catheter insertion procedure}

There are two techniques to insert a suprapubic catheter. The classic method is with the use of sterile gloves. The second method is the "no-touch technique" without sterile gloves. Instead, the sterile package of the catheter is used to touch the catheter. The no-touch technique is probably to be preferred, because there is less risk of contamination, but unfortunately there is no evidence in the literature available.

If the patient does not have a readily palpable bladder then ideally, the bladder should be filled with at least 300 ml prior to insertion of a suprapubic catheter (SPC). Ultrasonography may also be used as an adjunct to SPC insertion or with cystoscopy to ensure that the needle used to make the SPC tract can be visualised entering the bladder at an appropriate point on the anterior bladder wall.

In patients with a history of lower abdominal surgery or the bladder cannot be distended then an open procedure may have to be performed for insertion of the SPC. (LE 3) [74]

For practical guidelines on how to insert a suprapubic balloon catheter see Appendix D.

\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{6.4 Difficulties that may occur during insertion}

Difficulty in catheterising the patient can be caused by a variety of reasons. Medical advice and support should be sought if problems during or after the insertion occur. Complications associated with catheters include UTI, trauma and inflammatory reactions, urethral stricture, calculi, hypospadias, false route and possibly carcinoma of the bladder. [75] These can result in one or more of the following symptoms occurring: pain, bypassing, blockage, catheter expulsion and bleeding.

\subsection*{6.5 Catheter care / maintenance}

\subsection*{6.5.1 Meatal cleansing}

Routine daily personal hygiene is all that is needed to maintain meatal hygiene. [13, 76, 77, 78] Trials of various cleansing agents, e.g. chlorhexidine, saline etc., have failed to demonstrate a reduction in bacterial growth rate [79], meaning soap and water is sufficient to achieve effective meatal cleansing. [65, 80, 81] However attention must be given to educating noncircumcised patients to clean underneath their foreskin daily to remove smegma, as this may increase the patient's risk of developing a UTI in addition to causing trauma and ulceration to the meatus and glans penis. [76, 82]

There is no evidence that routine application of antimicrobial preparations around the meatus will prevent infections. [65, 81, 83]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l} 
- Routine daily hygiene (water and soap) is appropriate for meatal \\
cleansing
\end{tabular} & 1b & B \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l} 
- Application of topical antibiotic cream to the meatus around the \\
catheter does not reduce bacteriuria. [65, 81, 83]
\end{tabular} & 1b & B \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{6.5.2 Care of urethral catheters}

Whichever bag is chosen, extensive measures should also be taken to maintain unobstructed flow. [16] To prevent obstruction, the catheter and collecting tube should be kept free from kinking and the collecting bag has to be kept below the level of the bladder at all times (to allow urine to drain by gravity) and must never be rested on the floor. [16]
When emptying the collecting bag regularly use a separate, clean collecting container for each patient; avoid splashing, and prevent contact of the drainage spigot with the non-sterile collecting container. [16]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - Perform hand hygiene immediately before and after any manipulation of the catheter and system. Wear disposable gloves when handling the system & 1b & B \\
\hline - Maintain unobstructed urine flow [16] & 1b & B \\
\hline - Keep the catheter and collecting tube free from kinking & 1b & B \\
\hline - Keep the collecting bag below the level of the bladder at all times. Do not rest the bag on the floor & 1b & B \\
\hline - Empty the collecting bag regularly using a separate container for each patient; avoid splashing, and prevent contact of the drainage spigot with the non-sterile collecting container & 1b & B \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{6.5.3 Care of the suprapubic catheter site}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - Always ensure good hand hygiene is performed prior to any intervention [85] and use protective equipment e.g. gloves & 4 & C \\
\hline - Suprapubic catheter site should be cleaned daily with soap and water. Excess cleansing is not required [65, 81] and may increase the risk of infection & 1b & B \\
\hline - Observe the cystostomy site for signs of infection and over granulation & 4 & C \\
\hline - Antimicrobial agents should not routinely or as prophylactic treatment be applied to the cystostomy site to prevent infection [81, 83] & 1b & A \\
\hline - Dressings are best avoided, if a dressing is used to contain a discharge this should be undertaken with strict aseptic technique to protect against infection & 4 & C \\
\hline - Wherever possible, patients should be encouraged to change their own dressings [23] & 4 & C \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{6.5.4 Observation and management of catheter drainage}

The observations relate to the indication for catheterisation. Post-operatively catheterisation is often performed to monitor urine output. The monitoring of urine output is vital to ensure that the bladder continues to empty and that excessive diuresis does not occur. [84] In home settings observations relate to common complications to long-term catheters such as blockage and infections.

For Common problems with indwelling catheter equipment, see Appendix E. For Observation of urinary drainage, see Appendix F.

Indwelling catheters with open-drainage systems result in bacteriuria in almost $100 \%$ of cases within 3-4 days. [20,55] By using closed urinary drainage systems bacteriuria cannot be prevented, but it can be delayed. Almost all patients will develop bacteriuria within approximately 4 weeks. [20] Breaking a closed drainage system to obtain urine samples therefore increases the risk of CAUTI. [85]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - Maintain unobstructed urine flow [16] & 1b & B \\
\hline - Keep the catheter and collecting tube free from kinking & 1b & B \\

\hline -When emptying the collecting bag regularly use a separate, clean collecting container for each patient; avoid splashing, and prevent contact of the drainage spigot with the non sterile collecting container & 1b & B \\
\hline - Unnecessary disconnection of a sealed (pre-connected) drainage system should be avoided but if it occurs the catheter and collecting system have to be replaced using aseptic technique and sterile equipment & 1b & B \\
\hline - Catheter and drainage tubes should never be disconnected unless for good clinical reason & 2b & B \\
\hline - Disinfect the catheter/collecting tube junction when connected & 4 & C \\
\hline - Use of a urimeter which allows accurate measurement is recommended in intensive care patients [86] & 2b & B \\
\hline - Complex urinary drainage systems are not necessary for routine use & 2b & B \\
\hline - Extensive measures should also be taken to maintain unobstructed flow & 1b & B \\
\hline - Changing indwelling catheters or drainage bags at routine, fixed intervals is not recommended. Rather, catheters and drainage bags should be changed based on clinical indications such as infection, obstruction, or when the closed system is compromised [16] & 1b & B \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{6.5.5 Stabilising of the urethral catheter}

If the catheter is not secured properly, it may migrate from its intended point of stabilisation. Stabilising urethral catheters can reduce adverse events such as dislodgment, tissue trauma, inflammation and urinary tract infection. [87, 88, 89] Urethral trauma can be caused by any catheter size or by forced insertion of the catheter. Urethral trauma should be minimised by the use of adequate lubricant and the smallest possible catheter size. [20] (LE: 1b) Inflammation and trauma may also occur when the device is unsecured. Movement-induced trauma can lead to urinary tract infection and tissue necrosis. The use of a securement device reduces both the physical and psychological trauma to the patient by decreasing the need for reinsertion. If the catheter bag becomes too heavy with urine, and it is not supported properly, the bag can pull on the catheter. This, along with catheter movement at the site of insertion, can cause discomfort and irritation to the patient. [16, 90] To avoid necrosis at the urethral penile-scrotal junction caused by prolonged catheter pressure, it is recommended to secure urinary catheters to males' abdomen. [87] The catheter has to be positioned in a soft curve towards the femur (Fig. 35) and can be fixed with a securing device, tape, velcro ${ }^{\text {TM }}$ or a pocket for the bag (Fig. 36, 37, 38). Although the references are only for urethral catheterisation the same principles of stabilisation apply to suprapubic catheters. [54]

\subsection*{6.5.6 Clamping or not}

Bladder dysfunction and postoperative voiding impairment have been documented following catheterisation and these can lead to infections of the urinary tract. The intermittent clamping of the indwelling urethral catheter draining tube prior to withdrawal has been suggested on the basis that this simulates normal filling and emptying of the bladder. While clamping catheters might minimise postoperative neurogenic urinary dysfunction, it could also result in bladder infection or distension. A Cochrane review investigated the best strategies for the removal of catheters from patients with a short-term indwelling catheter. They compared clamping the indwelling urethral catheter prior to removal with free drainage. Because of poor methodological quality of the studies limited evidence is obtained from the review and it does not provide a robust base for the development of practice guidelines. [91] A review addressing short-term urinary catheter policies following urogenital surgery in adults concludes the same. A small study compared clamp-and-release policies before catheter removal versus immediate removal and found urinary tract infections were more common in the clamp-and-release group and this group took longer to return to normal bladder function. The value of clamp-and-release before catheter removal could not be assessed reliably, because of the quality of the study. [92]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - Further research is needed on the value of clamp-and-release & Unsolved issue \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{6.6 Changes of urine due to food and medication}

The presence of an appliance for collecting urine increases patient's awareness of both odour and colour changes affecting the urine caused by some medications and food products. (Appendix G) The patient and caregiver should be told that these changes are not harmful and do not necessarily occur in all patients. Normal urine is clear, straw-coloured with almost no odour. [93]

See table Possible colour and odour changes in urine due to food or medication, Appendix $G$.

\section*{Purple urine bag syndrome (PUBS)}

Purple urine bag syndrome is a rare condition and is characterised by a purple discolouration of the urine bag, appliances and various catheter tubing. The urine itself may be dark in colour and not necessarily purple. The condition appears to have a significantly higher incidence in women and chronically debilitated patients with long-term indwelling urinary catheters. [94, 95, 96] The major risk factors for PUBS are female gender, severe constipation, chronic indwelling urinary catheterisation and increased tryptophan dietary content. [94, 95] The purple colour is caused by the metabolism of tryptophan by bacteria to indole and later converted to indican in the liver. Indican passes through the kidney giving urine a purple/ blue/grey colour. [96, 97]

Although studies have shown certain factors may be present, these factors are not found consistently. [95, 98] PUBS is generally found to be harmless, but there have been case reports describing PUBS progressing to Fournier's gangrene. [99] The discolouration of the urine and the urine bag can be distressing for patient, family and healthcare workers, therefore they should be educated to manage this syndrome. [100] The incidence is reduced by avoiding constipation and proper care of the urinary catheter. [95, 98]

\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{6.7 Constipation}

Constipation may cause pressure on the drainage lumen that prevents the catheter from draining adequately, which can cause ureteric reflux and back pressure on the kidneys. [101, 102, 103] Chronic constipation may also cause leaking just like bladder spasms have been attributed to constipation by a multiple sclerosis patient. [104] Maintaining regular bowel function with a high-fibre and high-fluid intake helps prevent constipation. [104, 105]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}

\hline - Educating the patient regarding the link between constipation and bypassing urine & 4 & C \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{6.8 Suprapubic catheter change}

\section*{Change of the catheter}
- The change of a catheter is a medical order.
- Long-term catheters can be changed on an individual basis to try to avoid/anticipate problems. However, the catheter must be changed within the timeframe as per manufacturer's instructions which may be up to a maximum of 12 weeks.
- The catheter must be changed at the time of any identified catheter-related problems e.g. catheter blockage, catheter damage.
- A catheter change depends of the material of the catheter. A latex catheter is changed after 2 weeks to a hydrogel or silicone catheter.
- Check the catheter for encrustation after removal. If there is encrustation than its better to change the catheter earlier or when there is no encrustation the catheter can be changed later.

There are different techniques to change a suprapubic catheter. If the catheter change is uneventful the classic catheter with open eyes at the side and a closed eye at the end of the catheter is preferred. In case of severe problems with changing the catheter a changing set with Seldinger ${ }^{\text {TM }}$ and a catheter with an open end should be used.

Antibiotics are not routinely given prior to suprapubic catheter change but may be prescribed for patients deemed 'at risk' of infection at the physician's discretion.

Following initial insertion of a suprapubic catheter, the tract will take approximately between 10 days to 4 weeks to become established, after which time the catheter can be changed safely.

Comply with local protocols and procedures with regard to change of suprapubic catheter (male and female).

For Preparation and procedure for changing a suprapubic catheter, see Appendix H.

\end{tabular}

\subsection*{6.9 Removal of urethral and suprapubic catheters}

The nurse needs to monitor the need for a catheter carefully. In case removal might be considered, it should be discussed with the medical team. The removal of a catheter is a medical order.

Pain is frequently encountered during removal of both urethral and suprapubic catheters and is often a consequence of ridge formation on the catheter balloon. This can be minimised by allowing passive deflation of the balloon rather than applying active suction to the deflating channel. [106]

When the catheter has been removed, and advice on life style (e.g. drinking, etc.) has been given, make sure the patient understands he can contact you or your colleagues at any time if or when problems occur.

\subsection*{6.10 Potential problems during and following catheter removal}

There are several problems that might arise during removal of a urethral catheter and it is vital that the health care professional is aware of the actions required to overcome them.

Problems and management are listed in:

Appendix M Potential problems during catheter removal and
Appendix $N$ Potential problems following removal of the catheter.

\section*{7. Catheter complications}

\subsection*{7.1 Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI)}

The urinary tract is the most common source of nosocomial infection, particularly when the bladder is catheterized [20], accounting for nearly $40 \%$ of all hospital acquired infections (HAI) [12, 107, 108, 109, 110] (LE: 1a) with the duration of catheterisation being a significant risk factor [107, 109, 110, 111, 112]. (LE: 1a)

Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) is defined as bacteriuria or funguria with a count of more than 103 CFUs/mL. [113]

It is well accepted that bacterial colonisation with catheterisation is inevitable with some reports estimating the risk to be in the region of $5 \%$ per day with almost $100 \%$ colonisation risk at 7 to 10 days of catheterisation. The incidence of bacteriuria has been estimated to be about $3 \%$ to $10 \%$ higher each day after catheter insertion. [81, 114]

Prolonged urinary catheterisation is common amongst people in long-term care settings and this carries a high risk of developing a catheter-related urinary tract infection and associated problems. [51, 115]

Bacteruria is therefore an almost universal feature of urinalysis and does not require therapy in asymptomatic individuals.

Suprapubic catheters are less prone to cause symptomatic infection compared to urethral catheterisation and are preferable in appropriate patients. [20] (LE: 1b)

Urinary drainage systems are often reservoirs for multidrug-resistant bacteria and a source of transmission to other patients and also the main risk factor for nosocomial UTI, because they allow micro-organisms to by-pass host defences and reach the bladder. Extra-luminal contamination may occur when the catheter is inserted or later by micro-organisms ascending from the perineum. Intra luminal contamination occurs by reflux, which is prevented when closed urinary systems are used. [12, 55, 114, 117, 116]

The following have been shown to reduce the risk of CAUTI:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - Use of closed urinary drainage systems [55, 79, 118, 119] & 1a & A \\
\hline - Use of silver coated catheters [53, 108, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129] (Decrease by between 17 and $85 \%$ ) only for less than a week & 1b & A \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline - Use of a combination of a silver coated all silicone catheter and an antiseptic drainage system [130,131] (Decrease by between $47 \%$ and 61\%) & 2a & A \\
\hline - Use of stop orders and daily assessment of the need for urethral catheterisation [132] (Decrease by 52\%) & 1a & A \\
\hline - Avoid drainage tube occlusion [133] & 3 & A \\
\hline - Adhere to commonplace hand washing policy [133] & 3 & B \\
\hline - Use small lumen catheters [54] & 4 & C \\
\hline - Avoid unnecessary catheterisation & 1b & A \\
\hline - Remove the catheter as soon as possible & 1b & B \\
\hline - Use urinary catheters in operative patients only if necessary, not routinely & 1b & B \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

There is now good evidence that the following do not reduce the risk of developing CAUTI and therefore such practices are not recommended but may be utilised according to local policy and protocol.

\section*{Not recommended is:}
1. Cleansing with $0.05 \%$ chlorhexidine gluconate $[79,134,135]$ (LE: 1a)
2. Addition of chlorhexidine to drainage bags [79, 136] (LE: 1a)
3. Utilising povidine iodine to wash the genital area [138] (LE: 3)
4. Regular bladder washouts [79, 137] (LE: 1a)
5. Regular catheter bag changing [79, 139] (LE: 1a)
6. Regular meatal cleansing beyond normal hygiene [140, 79] (LE: 1a)
7. Systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis. This should not be routinely used in patients with short-term or long-term catheterisation to reduce catheter associated bacteriuria or UTI because of concern about selection of antimicrobial resistance. [45] Antibiotic prophylaxis when changing catheters should only be used for patients with a history of catheterassociated urinary tract infection following catheter change. [8] There is weak evidence that prophylactic antibiotics reduce CAUTI in female post abdominal surgical patients.[114] (LE: 3)

Infection may also occur at the site of an SPC insertion which may present as cellulites, requiring oral or intravenous antimicrobial pharmacotherapy depending upon severity or a subcutaneous abscess requiring formal incision and drainage.

Such infections are more common in patients who are immunocompromised.

\section*{Prevention}

Replacing chronic catheters prior to commencement of antibiotics for symptomatic UTI yields greater and faster clinical improvement. [141] (LE: 2b)

\section*{Treatment}

Only patients with symptomatic positive urinalysis should receive treatment. This should be a pure isolated organism with greater than $10^{3}$ organisms per hpf.

\subsection*{7.2 Epididymitis}

Epididymitis is an inflammation of the epididymis. The condition causes pain and swelling and is almost always unilateral and relatively acute in onset. In elderly patients, epididymitis is usually due to common urinary pathogens. [20] Epididymitis as a complication to urethral catheterisation is seen significantly more often in patients with indwelling catheters compared to intermittent catheterisation. One study observed epididymitis in almost $5 \%$ of spinal cord injury patients with long-term indwelling catheters. The author of the study points out that patient-related factors such as personal hygiene, fluid intake and catheter care should be remembered, too. [142] (LE: 2a)

\subsection*{7.3 Catheter blockage}

40-50\% of patients with indwelling catheters experience problems with lumen blockage [143, 144, 145, 146] (LE: 2b) as a consequence of either debris or encrustation. Studies have shown that over 70\% of blocked catheters are encrusted and of these, over 60\% are associated with bladder stones. [144, 147, 148]
Blockage can also occur as a result of kinking of the catheter, catheter against bladder wall or constipation. Urinary leakage can occur as a symptom of catheter blockage.

\section*{Catheter encrustation}

Encrustation is a result of bacteria in the urine, most commonly 'Proteus' (P. mirabilis), that produce an enzyme called urease, which splits urinary urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. This results in an increase in alkalinity, providing ideal conditions for the development of crystals, e.g. struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) and calcium phosphate. The crystals develop around the eyelets, balloon and internal lumen of the catheter. [137]

\section*{Debris}

Debris is caused by urothelial cells from the bladder or tumours shedding cells, blood from infection, disease, urological surgery or trauma or from mucus.

\section*{Biofilm}

A thin layer of micro-organism adhering to the surface of a structure, which may be organic or inorganic, together with the polymers that they secrete. [149, 150, 151]

\section*{Prevention and treatment}

The evidence base for prevention is weak with some series suggesting that potassium citrate supplementation, increased fluid intake and lemon juice supplements all reduce the incidence and severity of catheter encrustation [143, 152] (LE: 2a) The Cochrane review based on suggests there are no high level evidence studies on prevention. [137] (LE: 1b)

In vitro studies suggest that daily bladder washouts (BWO) with EDTA solution may prolong the time to blockage by almost 50\% [153] (LE: 2b), although this has not yet been translated into clinical practice and as such cannot be recommended at this stage.

Bladder washouts and bladder instillations seem to be more extended in clinical practice than other solutions despite the limited evidence of their effectiveness. (See Chapter 8: Bladder Washout) [85]

Further studies have shown that intermittent drainage every 2-4 hours reduces the rate of catheter blockage compared to continuous flow. [58] (LE: 2b)

A dependent free draining catheter bag may exert significant syphoning pressure resulting in severe catheter reaction within the bladder urothelium. This polypoidal inflammation in turn may block the catheter holes and result in blockage. (LE: 4) Elevation of the catheter bag to eliminate such pressure may alleviate this risk.

Larger catheter lumens also reduce blockage. Silicone catheters appear to be affected by blockage less often than other catheters, which may be explained by the larger lumen, but the material may also be a contributing factor. [144, 145] (LE: 3)

For Bladder washout - Procedure and troubleshooting, see Appendix 0

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - Patients with regular catheter blockage should be investigated for possible bladder stones & 2b & B \\
\hline - Intermittent drainage every 2-4 hours reduces the rate of catheter blockage compared to continuous flow & 2b & B \\
\hline - Optimise fluid intake and use lemon juice supplements to reduce the incidence and severity of catheter encrustation & 2a & B \\
\hline - Elevation of the catheter bag to eliminate pressure within the bladder urothelium may alleviate the risk of polypoidal inflammation with blockage as a result & 4 & C \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{7.4 Catheter bypassing}

Catheter bypassing, occurs in up to $40 \%$ of patients with indwelling catheters [146], and may occur as a consequence of various aetiologies including catheter blockage (see section 7.3 above), bladder spasm (see point 7.6 below), constipation, pulling on the catheter or a too large diameter of the catheter. In itself, catheter bypassing is not a diagnosis but rather a symptom, treatment of which should be aimed at the underlying cause.

\section*{7.5 latrogenic trauma}
latrogenic trauma during urethral catheterisation may result in either the formation of a false passage, usually at the level of the prostate or bladder neck, urethral stricture disease or traumatic cleaving in the male [154], with sphincteric disruption in the female. (LE: 3) Such trauma is rare, with an overall incidence of $0.3 \%$, decreased by medical and nursing personnel education by up to 78\%. [155] (LE: 3)
Traumatic cleaving and sphincteric disruption can be avoided by preventing catheter traction or preferably conversion to SPC. (LE: 4) Paraphimosis may occur when an uncircumcised male is catheterised and the prepuce is not replaced. Care and continued patient and carer education will reduce the incidence of such a complication. (LE: 4)
$11 \%$ of urethral strictures requiring urethroplasty arise following urethral catheterisation. [156] (LE: 3)

Suprapubic catheterisation is associated with a potential for visceral injury which although difficult to reliably quantify due to under-reporting, is in the region of $2-3 \%$ for bowel perforation, carrying a 30 -day mortality rate in the region of $2 \%$. [157, 158, 159] (LE: 3) Visceral trauma is more common amongst patients with previous lower abdominal surgery and in those with neurological disease. [158] (LE: 3)

\section*{Prevention}

The incidence of visceral trauma during SPC insertion may be reduced by the utilisation of ultrasound to ensure an unhindered route from the skin into the bladder. With training it is possible to detect bowel interposed in the intended path of insertion. (LE: 4) Trauma is also prevented by ensuring there is some urine ( 300 ml ) in the bladder. If there is not sufficient urine in the bladder try to enlarge the volume via the transurethral or oral route. (LE: 4)

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - Traumatic cleaving and sphincteric disruption can be avoided by preventing catheter traction or preferably conversion to SPC & 4 & C \\
\hline - Training could make it possible to detect bowel interposed in the intended path of insertion & 4 & C \\
\hline - To prevent trauma it is essential to ensure that there is some urine (preferably 300 ml ) in the bladder & 4 & C \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{7.6 Bladder spasm}

Bladder spasm is very common in patients with indwelling catheters and is best managed with aniticholinergic medication which may be given orally, transdermally or intravesically. Chronic constipation may also cause bladder spasm. Maintaining regular bowel function with a high-fibre and high-fluid intake helps prevent constipation. [104, 105] Sometimes a different catheter (smaller lumen and balloon size) can reduce the spasm caused by constipation. (LE: 4)

Should this fail, intra-detrusor injections of botulinum toxin A may be administered. [160] (LE: 3)

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - Educate the patient regarding the link between constipation and bladder spasm & 4 & C \\
\hline - Bladder spasm are best managed with anticholinergic medication & 3 & B \\
\hline - Intra-detrusor injections of botulinum toxin A may be administered if anticholinergic medications should fail & 3 & B \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{7.7 Bladder pain}

Bladder pain may be an extreme form of urgency experienced as a consequence of detrusor spasm or may exist as a distinct entity without an associated urge to void.
Catheter associated bladder pain is exacerbated by constipation which therefore should be treated as a priority in affected individuals. [161] (LE: 3). Catheter-associated bladder pain is mentioned here as possible complication of catheterisation. Other aspects of bladder pain and painful bladder syndrome fall outside the remit of this guideline.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - Various studies have shown success in treating catheter associated bladder pain with anticholinergic medications, which reduce both the incidence and severity of such pain [161, 162] & 1b & A \\
\hline - Ketamine has also been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of catheter related bladder pain at a dose of $250 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg}$ [163] & 2a & B \\
\hline - It would appear that the incidence of bladder pain is less for suprapubic catheters than for urethral catheters but the explanation for this is currently unclear, although may be related to its more apical position which may minimise or avoid trigonal stimulation [42] & 1a & A \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{7.8 Haematuria}

Haematuria may occur following catheterisation and is usually self limiting. During urethral catheterisation, prostatic trauma may be the underlying cause, although decompression of high pressure chronic retention may also result in haematuria.
If such haematuria fails to settle, irrigation through a 3-way catheter may be required or in more severe cases, formal bladder washout under general anaesthesia may be necessary. (LE: 4)

Haematuria following supra-pubic catheterisation may be resolved by irrigation through the SPC or via an additional urethral catheter. (LE: 4)

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - If haematuria fails to settle, irrigation through a 3-way catheter may be required or in more severe cases, formal bladder washout under general anaesthesia may be necessary & 4 & C \\
\hline - Haematuria following suprapubic catheterisation may be resolved by irrigation through the SPC or via an additional urethral catheter & 4 & C \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{7.9 Granuloma formation}

This complication is limited to suprapubic catheterisation and merely requires application of silver nitrate in the vast majority of cases. Rarely, if this is ineffective, surgical excision of the granuloma may be required with or without re-siting the SPC. (LE: 4)

\subsection*{7.10 Urinary extravasation}

Although almost exclusively related to suprapubic catheterisation, it is possible to cause bladder rupture with resultant urinary extravasation when catheterising with the aid of a catheter introducer. A free draining catheter and antibiotic therapy will usually resolve the situation but occasionally a radiological inserted drain may be required, or even, in the case of bladder rupture as a consequence of an introducer, laparotomy and primary bladder repair will be necessary. (LE: 4)

\subsection*{7.11 Inability to remove catheter}

Catheters may occasionally prove impossible to remove via balloon deflation. This may be as a consequence of balloon calcific encrustation or a faulty deflation mechanism.

Cutting the catheter below the bifurcation may result in deflation and allow catheter removal but if this fails, ultrasound guided transabdominal balloon puncture may be required. (LE: 4)

Please be aware that cutting the catheter will invalidate product liability. Should this method be employed, it is important to cystoscope the patient to ensure all balloon fragments are removed in order to avoid the potential consequence of calcification around the remaining foreign body with resultant bladder calculus formation. (LE: 3 )

An alternative method in the event of being unable to remove an SPC is to utilise a flexible cystoscope and attempt balloon perforation with a metal guide wire of fine gauge needle. Again evacuation of all catheter matter is essential. (LE: 4)

Transrectal perforation of catheter balloons should be avoided for fear of sepsis. (LE: 4) Formation of a catheter knot in the bladder is a rare cause of catheter-retention, and usually requires endoscopic removal. [164]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - In case of inability to remove catheter ultrasound guided transabdominal balloon puncture may be required & 4 & C \\
\hline - In case of inability to remove catheter utilise of a flexible cystoscope and attempt balloon perforation with a metal guide wire of fine gauge needle may be required & 4 & C \\
\hline - Transrectal perforation of catheter balloons should be avoided for fear of sepsis & 4 & C \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{7.12 Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)}

Chronic catheterisation, in common with other forms of chronic urothelial irritation, may increase the risk of SCC formation.
Chronic catheterisation in spinal cord injury patients is the greatest pre-disposing factor for the development of non schistosomiasis induced SCC of the bladder [165], with the only potential way of reducing this risk being to avoid catheterisation is such patients if at all possible. (LE: 3)

\section*{8. Bladder washout, irrigation and instillation}

In clinical practice the most extendedly used terms are "manual washout or bladder lavage" defined as the washing out of the bladder with sterile fluid and "bladder irrigation" as the continuous washing out of the bladder with sterile fluid. [166, 167, 168] Bladder instillations appear to have several indications, one of them is to prevent or treat catheter blockages. Furthermore, instillation treatments are not limited to saline or citric acid solutions; there are some others such as chemotherapy drugs (i.e. mitomycin-C or epirubicin) or antiinflammatory drugs (i.e. hyaluronic acid), to reduce toxicity of brachytherapy [169] or vesicoureteral reflux. [170]

\subsection*{8.1 Washout policies/catheter maintenance in long-term urethral catheterisation}

People requiring long-term bladder draining with an indwelling catheter can experience catheter blockage. As there are quite a few causes of catheter blockage (e.g. kinks in a tube, constipation, catheter against bladder wall, encrustation, debris) it is important to diagnose the exact reason for the blockage in order to decide the correct course of treatment.

Regiments involving different solutions are being used to wash out catheters with the aim of preventing blockage. Hagen et al, 2010 [137] conducted a Cochrane review comparing washout versus no washout, different washout solutions, frequency, duration, volume, concentration, method of administration in any setting with an indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter for more than 28 days.

Hagen et al, 2010 found only 5 relevant articles; all these concluded that there was no evidence that washouts were helpful. It was stated that trials were sparse and generally of poor quality or poorly reported, and that the evidence was too scanty to conclude whether or not washouts were beneficial.

Despite this conclusion, in daily practice bladder washouts are still often recommended in special circumstances, such as removal of encrustation in certain long-term indwelling catheters or removal of blood clots after urological surgery or in palliative treatment of intractable haematuria. [171 in 137, 172] As stated in the Cochrane review [45, 137] there is no evidence how long, and what kind of solutions should be given.
So, bladder washout / catheter maintenance is an option to be discussed with the patient and the clinical team on an individual patient basis. [173] Based on the evidence the working group only recommends bladder washout in bleeding and certain urological surgical procedures.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - Routinely bladder washouts are not beneficial [45,137] & 1a & A \\
\hline - Bladder Irrigation and instillation of maintenance solutions do not prevent catheter associated infections. However they may be recommended in special circumstances e.g. management of blood clots [45, 137] & 1b & A \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{9. Urinalysis}

Urinalysis should not be routinely performed on all long-term catheterised patients, as virtually all patients will have bacteria present in their urine. [174]

\section*{Indications}

Urinalysis / catheter specimen of urine (CSU) should be undertaken when:
1. Patient is systemically unwell
2. Patient has a high temperature
3. Following lack of response to treatment
4. Admitted/transferred to hospital to ascertain the presence of HAI or CAI (hospital or community acquired infection). [23]

\section*{Technique}

Urine samples from a catheter must be obtained under aseptic technique from the needle free sampling port by syringe aspiration. [16]
The sampling port has been specially designed to re-seal after aspiration of the urine sample. [175]
Obtain large volumes of urine for special analyses (not culture) aseptically from the drainage bag. [16] (LE: 1b)
If the indwelling catheter has been in place for more than 7 days, the catheter should be changed, and the urine should be collected from the new catheter so the sample is representative of the microorganisms really present in the bladder and not the microorganisms that have adhered to the interior wall of the catheter. [45]

For the procedure of Obtaining a urine sample from an indwelling catheter, see Appendix P.

\section*{Dipstick}

Bacterial colonisation with catheterisation is inevitable with almost $100 \%$ colonisation risk at 7-10 days [42] and does not require therapy in asymptomatic individuals, the use of dipstick to detect UTI is not recommended. If dipstick is used to detect glucose in the urine, attention should be paid that uric acid and vitamin C can cause a false-negative result. [176]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - For urine analyses; aspirate the urine from the needleless sampling port with a sterile syringe/cannula adapter after cleansing the port with a disinfectant [16] & 1b & B \\
\hline - Obtain large volumes of urine for special analyses (not culture) aseptically from the drainage bag [16] & 1b & B \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{10. Infection prevention}

\subsection*{10.1 Fluid intake}

Drinking sufficient fluid dilutes the urine and helps reduce the risk of catheter encrustation and blockage. A good fluid intake also ensures a constant downward drainage and flushing effect. There is no standard amount of advised fluid intake and the type of fluid consumed appears to be insignificant as long as the volume is sufficient to prevent concentration of urine The amount of fluid needed varies and depends on patient's size ( $25-35 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day ), amount of fluid loss, patient's food intake and patients circulatory and renal status. Regular fluid intake maintains the urinary flow and reduces the risk of infection and catheter blockage. The patient should be given sufficiently fluid to maintain an output of $50-100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{h}$. [12, 102, 103, 177]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - The patient should be given sufficient fluid to maintain an output of $50-100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{h}$ & 2b & B \\
\hline - To promote "Good fluid intake" should be advised to all catheter users to promote the flow of urine and prevent blockage & 4 & C \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{10.2 Cranberries}

Cranberries have been used for several decades for the prevention and treatment of UTI. Cranberries comprise nearly $90 \%$ water and also contain various organic substances such as quinic acid, malic acid and citric acid as well as glucose and fructose. No definite mechanism of actin has been established for cranberry in the prevention or treatment of UTIs. The main suggestion is that cranberries prevent bacteria from sticking to uroepithelial cells that line the wall of the bladder. [116] A Cochrane review identified 10 studies comparing cranberry products with placebo, juice or water and found that cranberries can prevent recurrent infection in women, but there is no evidence that cranberries are effective in people who need catheterisation. [116] Another study tested the effect of cranberry juice on encrustation and blockage by biofilms, which also may cause UTI because bacteriuria is inevitably associated with encrustation. This study found that drinking cranberry juice did not produce urine that was inhibitory to the development of biofilms.

Beside the ineffectiveness of preventing UTI, attention should be paid to the interaction between cranberry and warfarin. Studies indicates that cranberry may potentiate the effect of warfarin. [178]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l} 
- Cranberry products are not effective in preventing UTI in people with \\
indwelling catheters
\end{tabular} & 1 b & B \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{10.3 Hand hygiene}

Hand-mediated transmission is a major factor in increasing the risk of infections to patients, which emphasises the vital importance of hand hygiene and use of personal protective equipment such as aprons and gloves. [85] It is important to maintain unobstructed urine flow. [16]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - Perform hand hygiene immediately before and after insertion or any manipulation of the catheter device or site [16] & 1b & A \\
\hline - Carers and patients managing their own catheters must wash their hands before and after manipulation of the catheter [8] & 1b & A \\
\hline - Healthcare professionals should observe protocols on hand washing and the need to use disposable gloves between catheterised patients [12, 20] & 1b & B \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{11. Patient Quality of Life (QoL)}

\subsection*{11.1 Impact of a catheter on the patient}

An indwelling urinary catheter often will be placed, at the outpatient's clinic or emergency room, in for the patient a stress situation; the patient is referred because of urinary retention. Or an indwelling catheter is the last alternative, after all other treatments have failed, for example clean intermittent catheterisation, medication, use of pads or male external catheters. The catheter can be a relieve at that moment, but as Wilde, WCON, 2003 [179] discussed, urinary catheters may be commonplace to health care professionals; wearing one may not be that easy. A patient can be faced with different kinds of problems, such as urinary catheter equipment, how to deal with sexual activities, UTI or even sepsis, emptying bags problems, catheter changes, clothing adjustments, positioning of tubing, (hand) hygiene, meatal cleansing, falling out of the catheter, odour, kinking of catheter. [48, 54, 179, 180]

The process of learning to accept the catheter was reported to take about 1 year's time in one study. [181 in 179] Also Wilde [179] discovered in her study that participants who wore the catheter longer were most accepting.

Most participants viewed their catheter in a balanced way, minimising the negative and emphasising the positive. It is a necessity to treat a medical problem related to underlying disease or injury.
Statements of participants about their catheter are: 'a necessary evil', 'a part of me', 'it makes life easier for me now', 'becomes second nature'. [179, page 34-35]

\subsection*{11.2 Sexuality and body-image}

There is a lack of research how sexual intercourse is affected by catheter use. Patients with indwelling catheters can experience not only physical problems but also emotional problems. Several constraints may impair teaching/counseling about sexuality, including lack of privacy because of several caregivers in the home, insufficient information about patient's neurological status, cultural taboos, or views that chronically ill people do not have sexual needs and desires. Making adjustments in sexual activities can be a challenge for patients, require support, open communication, and sensitivity of nurses. But by not bringing up this sensitive subject, nurses put their patients in the uncomfortable position of having to introduce the topic themselves. It should be a part of the routine teaching. [179]

\section*{Advice which can be given:}
- Discuss with patient that sexual behaviour encompasses a range of activities from caressing, kissing and masturbation to penetration of the vagina by the penis.
- Patients (or partner) can be taught to remove the catheter and replace it after intercourse.
- Women can tape the catheter on to the abdomen.
- Men can tape the catheter along the erect penis and secure it under a male external catheter [148]
- The drainage bag, once emptied, can be positioned out of the way in the bed.
- Alternatively, the drainage bag can be disconnected from the catheter and a valve attached during intercourse.
- A water-based lubrication can be used to facilitate insertion (oil-based lubrication can damage the catheter and rot the male external catheter).
- A suprapubic catheter, whenever possible, rather than a urethral catheter should be used.
- Different position during intercourse can be discussed. Of course the position should be comfortable for the patient, so he/she can relax. Some positions can cause increased traction on the catheter in females, such as a face-to-face position with the partner on top. Traction can be reduced by placing a pillow under the woman's bottom to raise the pelvis.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - It is recommended that these sexual issues should be discussed in an early stage of catheterisation before relationship problems may have occurred & 4 & C \\
\hline - If possible, sometimes a sexual counsellor is an option to give advice and practical suggestions [48] & 4 & C \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{11.3 Social support}

Wearing a catheter is often not a choice, and the experience leads to a time of embodied change, altering one's view of self within the world. [180] A lot of urological patients live with chronic illness and require ongoing care. It is generally argued that those with low levels of social support experience poorer quality of life and adjustment to illness. In some countries there are foundations for patients, such as the Bladder and Bowel Foundation in the United Kingdom or the Pelvic Floor Foundation in The Netherlands.

\subsection*{11.4 Patient and caregiver instruction on dismissal:}

\section*{Advice and information}

Many patients develop special skills in observing their bodies in relation to the catheter, such as the use of their hands to check periodically for the leg bag filling, or they feel the weight on his/her leg increasing. But most participants empty the bag on a schedule very similar to most people's daily pattern. Other skills are: awareness of changes of urine flow through the catheter, checking the tube for kinks, and especially for SCI-patients: symptoms of trigger autonomic dysreflexia. [104, 179]

As Wilde, 2003 [179] state: living with a long-term indwelling catheter can be a challenge, but with support and information about the best practice, individuals can adapt to this change.

Patients and cave-givers should be provided with written and verbal information to support the following:
- Simple anatomy of the urinary tract
- What is a catheter, position of the catheter in the bladder in relation to function
- Hygiene and hand washing
- Care of the drainage system and obtaining further supplies
- How to set up a link system and care for a free-standing bag
- Frequency of catheter and bag changes
- Information on who will change their catheter
- Avoiding constipation, fluid intake advice
- How to recognise the onset of problems such as blockage and infection
- How to deal with specific problems, where and when to seek further advice (NS, the urologist or the urology department), date of re-catheterisation and who will do this
- Contact numbers to access advice and support
[37, 48]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & LE & GR \\
\hline - Patients should receive, written and oral, information about living with an indwelling catheter and its possible problems & 4 & C \\
\hline - Patients should be informed about reimbursement for catheter equipment & 4 & C \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{11.5 Supply and reimbursement of catheter equipment}

It is recommended that patients receive catheter packs from the hospital pharmacy or other medical suppliers, to ensure that the patient can start at home immediately. Equipment may vary, but consists mostly of a new catheter, leg bags, night bags, straps/stockinet holder, bed holder and/or a catheter valve. In case of a suprapubic catheter sometimes also a dressing may be required if secretions soil clothing, but this is not essential. [48]

Reimbursement differs in European countries as each country has its own healthcare insurance system and the personal insurance schemes also vary.

\section*{12. Documentation}

Evidence-based guidelines such as this one are useful. Caregivers can convert these guidelines into local policies and procedures.
As Foulkes, 2008 [182] describes, there are still a lot of problems which patients with longterm indwelling catheters can experience. Without an ongoing catheter care protocol for patients with indwelling urinary catheters, important issues are likely to be neglected. [183]

There are different rules and experiences [184] of documentation in different countries. Written catheter care protocols are necessary to secure details of the procedure in the appropriate place. [12, 24, 65] The following issues should be recorded:
1. Catheter type/balloon/Ch/length
2. Batch number / Lot number
3. Expiry date
4. Date of insertion
5. Reason for catheterisation or changing catheter
6. Patients reaction to catheterisation and any complaints due to catheter in situ
7. Problems with catheter insertion and type of problem
8. Description of urine, colour and volume drained
9. Specimen collected
10. Identity of catheteriser

Some catheter manufacturers have printed booklets for this purpose that accompany their catheters.

Rew, 2005 [101] developed a form (catheter change record) in which the above issues are represented. Patients with long-term indwelling urethral catheters may profit from such a change record, because this may help detect and thus prevent potential problems such as encrustation.

\section*{Example Catheter change record (adapted from Rew 2005), see Appendix Q}

In case of problems Mitchell, 2008 [173] developed an evidence-based long-term urinary catheter management flow chart. She reviewed the literature on evidence. As a result, for example, in this chart there is no recommendation about catheter maintenance solutions, because there is no evidence for this. It is a tool to be discussed with the patient and the clinical team on an individual patient basis. In case of blockage the literature advises to look back over at least the last 3 catheter changes (the catheter change record can be used for this).

\section*{Potential problems during catheter removal}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Problem & Cause & Suggested action \\
\hline \multirow[t]{5}{*}{1. Unable to deflate balloon.} & Damaged or faulty valve on the inflation / deflation arm of the catheter. & Check the valve for evidence of damage.

[196] \\
\hline & \multirow[t]{4}{*}{Channel obstruction.} & Attach syringe to the inflation arm and leave in place for $20-40$ minutes. The effect of gravity will help with the deflation process. [196] \\
\hline & & Squeeze the visible tubing to try and displace crystal formation in inflation channel. [196] Snip the balloon tube and insert a small mandrain and perforate the balloon. It is necessary that the bladder is full and the balloon is retracted to the bladder neck. \\
\hline & & If the above are unsuccessful refer to medical staff as the balloon will need to be punctured suprapubically using a needle under ultrasound visualisation. [196, 198] \\
\hline & & Following catheter removal the balloon should be inspected to ensure it is intact and that there are no fragments left in the bladder. [196, 198] \\
\hline 2. Wrinkling of balloon following deflation resulting in formation of a 'cuff'. & Balloon unable to return to pre-inflation shape resulting in formation of a ridge. & Withdraw catheter gently on deflation of balloon, but if resistance experienced stop the procedure. Using a syringe re-insert $1-2 \mathrm{ml}$ of saline ( NaCl ) back into the balloon; this action will prevent formation of a 'cuff'. Withdrawal of the catheter should now be easier and patient discomfort and potential urethral trauma will be reduced. \\
\hline 3. Pain & Balloon cuffing (as above) or sensitivity experienced at the bladder neck or within the urethra from the catheter. & Good patient preparation and support throughout the procedure is essential so that the patient is relaxed and fully aware of what to expect. Inserting anaesthetic (lignocaine/ lidocaine) gel into the drainage port of the catheter 3-5 minutes prior to removal can reduce sensitivity at the bladder neck. It should be noted that more than $2-3 \mathrm{ml}$ will need to be used as this volume will remain within the catheter. [198] \\

\section*{Bladder washout - procedure and troubleshooting}

\section*{Before starting the procedure you have to consider:}
- Management and maintenance of three-way Foley catheter (Fig. 40) involves a closed drainage system and sterile technique;
- Saline solution for infusion should be stored and infused at room temperature to avoid bladder spasms;
- Strict "Intake and Output" is recommended for all patients receiving Continuous Bladder Irrigation (CBI). Special attention to frail elderly and/or history of pelvic floor or bladder radiation should be paid. These patients are at high risk for bladder perforation.

\section*{Equipment}
- Sterile $0.9 \%$ sodium chloride irrigation bags ( 3000 ml )*
- Irrigation tubing
- Foley (3-way)
- Large Foley drainage bag
- 60 ml syringe
- Sterile saline ( 50 ml )

\section*{Implementation process}
- Foley (3-way) insertion (see section 5.1.3. and 6.2).
- Connect the middle lumen to drainage bag ( 2000 ml )
- Connect the third lumen to sodium chloride irrigation bags. The speed of irrigation depends on haematuria and bladder characteristics.
- Use strict aseptic technique when handling any of the equipment to prevent introduction of microorganisms into the urinary tract.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 40 Three lumen catheter for Continuous Bladder Irrigation}
\end{figure}

\section*{Troubleshooting}
1. Drainage out is less than irrigation infused
- Stop the irrigation. (Recalculate "Intake and Output");
- Ensure that tubing is not kinked or looped below bladder level;
- Palpate bladder for distention. (Use bladder scanner if available, to facilitate genitourinary assessment as per unit's routine);
- If obstruction is suspected, gentle manual irrigation may be required as per physician's orders;
- Cleanse the catheter opening. Use nothing smaller than a 60 ml syringe and sterile saline (Fig. 41);
- Use slow, even pressure to avoid damaging the bladder wall. Do not force if resistance is met;
- Allow irrigation to flow back freely.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 41 Syringe ( 60 ml ) and sterile saline to remove clots}
\end{figure}
(Source: M. Gea-SÃ¡nchez)
2. Increased bloody drainage or presence of clots.
- Increase rate of irrigation infusion as per physician's orders;
- Irrigation of catheter as outlined in 1 to aid in clot removal may be indicated;
- If large amount blood or clots persists, notify physician.
3. Patient complains of pain: (Complete pain assessment using the $0-10$ or visual analogue scale)
- Palpate bladder to determine presence of distention;
- Check drainage tubing for kinks;
- Observe drainage for adequate amount, presence of clots that might be blocking drainage tube. Evaluate "Intake and Output;"
- Avoid cold irrigation solution as it may cause bladder spasm.
4. The patient is confused/agitated
- Assess if patient is orientated to time, place, person;
- Have relevant information ready to share (i.e. amount of opioids received, amount of CBI received, true urine output, time of onset of alteration in orientation, sodium level; in TURP syndrome an overload of fluid through the prostatic sinuses can lead to dilutional hyponatremia, confusion and hypertension).
5. Solution leaks around the Foley catheter
- Assess for bladder spasms;
- Refer to \#1 - assessing for obstruction;
- Consider administering antispasmatic i.e. Buscopan.

\section*{Documentation}

Documentation includes:
- Patient's comfort/pain level (how procedure is being tolerated)
- Colour and type of drainage, presence of clots/fragments
- Intake and output; use following calculation:

\section*{CBI infused- Foley output = True urine output}
- Interventions required (manual irrigation, use of bladder scanner)
- Health teaching done with patient and family
- Patient concerns/adverse reactions (i.e. continued bladder spasms, decreased total urine output), the nursing actions taken and patient outcomes
*A Cochrane systematic review (2010) concluded that there are no differences between saline, acid or antibiotic solutions. [137]
