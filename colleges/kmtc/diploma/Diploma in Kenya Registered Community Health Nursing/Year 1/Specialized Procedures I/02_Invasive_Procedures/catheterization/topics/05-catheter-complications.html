                        <p>The urinary tract is the most common source of nosocomial infection, particularly when the bladder is catheterized [20], accounting for nearly 40% of all hospital acquired infections (HAI) [12, 107, 108, 109, 110] (LE: 1a) with the duration of catheterisation being a significant risk factor [107, 109, 110, 111, 112]. (LE: 1a)</p>
                        <p>Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) is defined as bacteriuria or funguria with a count of more than 103 CFUs/mL. [113]</p>
                        <p>It is well accepted that bacterial colonisation with catheterisation is inevitable with some reports estimating the risk to be in the region of 5% per day with almost 100% colonisation risk at 7 to 10 days of catheterisation. The incidence of bacteriuria has been estimated to be about 3% to 10% higher each day after catheter insertion. [81, 114]</p>
                        <p>Prolonged urinary catheterisation is common amongst people in long-term care settings and this carries a high risk of developing a catheter-related urinary tract infection and associated problems. [51, 115]</p>
                        <p>Bacteruria is therefore an almost universal feature of urinalysis and does not require therapy in asymptomatic individuals.</p>
                        <p>Suprapubic catheters are less prone to cause symptomatic infection compared to urethral catheterisation and are preferable in appropriate patients. [20] (LE: 1b)</p>
                        <p>Urinary drainage systems are often reservoirs for multidrug-resistant bacteria and a source of transmission to other patients and also the main risk factor for nosocomial UTI, because they allow micro-organisms to by-pass host defences and reach the bladder. Extra-luminal contamination may occur when the catheter is inserted or later by micro-organisms ascending from the perineum. Intra luminal contamination occurs by reflux, which is prevented when closed urinary systems are used. [12, 55, 114, 117, 116]</p>
                        <p>The following have been shown to reduce the risk of CAUTI:</p>

                        <p>There is now good evidence that the following do not reduce the risk of developing CAUTI and therefore such practices are not recommended but may be utilised according to local policy and protocol.</p>
                        <p><strong>Not recommended is:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Cleansing with 0.05% chlorhexidine gluconate [79, 134, 135] (LE: 1a)</li>
                            <li>Addition of chlorhexidine to drainage bags [79, 136] (LE: 1a)</li>
                            <li>Utilising povidine iodine to wash the genital area [138] (LE: 3)</li>
                            <li>Regular bladder washouts [79, 137] (LE: 1a)</li>
                            <li>Regular catheter bag changing [79, 139] (LE: 1a)</li>
                            <li>Regular meatal cleansing beyond normal hygiene [140, 79] (LE: 1a)</li>
                            <li>Systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis. This should not be routinely used in patients with short-term or long-term catheterisation to reduce catheter associated bacteriuria or UTI because of concern about selection of antimicrobial resistance. [45] Antibiotic prophylaxis when changing catheters should only be used for patients with a history of catheterassociated urinary tract infection following catheter change. [8] There is weak evidence that prophylactic antibiotics reduce CAUTI in female post abdominal surgical patients.[114] (LE: 3)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Infection may also occur at the site of an SPC insertion which may present as cellulites, requiring oral or intravenous antimicrobial pharmacotherapy depending upon severity or a subcutaneous abscess requiring formal incision and drainage.</p>
                        <p>Such infections are more common in patients who are immunocompromised.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention</h4>
                        <p>Replacing chronic catheters prior to commencement of antibiotics for symptomatic UTI yields greater and faster clinical improvement. [141] (LE: 2b)</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                        <p>Only patients with symptomatic positive urinalysis should receive treatment. This should be a pure isolated organism with greater than 10<sup>3</sup> organisms per hpf.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7.2 Epididymitis</h3>
                        <p>Epididymitis is an inflammation of the epididymis. The condition causes pain and swelling and is almost always unilateral and relatively acute in onset. In elderly patients, epididymitis is usually due to common urinary pathogens. [20] Epididymitis as a complication to urethral catheterisation is seen significantly more often in patients with indwelling catheters compared to intermittent catheterisation. One study observed epididymitis in almost 5% of spinal cord injury patients with long-term indwelling catheters. The author of the study points out that patient-related factors such as personal hygiene, fluid intake and catheter care should be remembered, too. [142] (LE: 2a)</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7.3 Catheter blockage</h3>
                        <p>40-50% of patients with indwelling catheters experience problems with lumen blockage [143, 144, 145, 146] (LE: 2b) as a consequence of either debris or encrustation. Studies have shown that over 70% of blocked catheters are encrusted and of these, over 60% are associated with bladder stones. [144, 147, 148] Blockage can also occur as a result of kinking of the catheter, catheter against bladder wall or constipation. Urinary leakage can occur as a symptom of catheter blockage.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Catheter encrustation</h4>
                        <p>Encrustation is a result of bacteria in the urine, most commonly 'Proteus' (P. mirabilis), that produce an enzyme called urease, which splits urinary urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. This results in an increase in alkalinity, providing ideal conditions for the development of crystals, e.g. struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) and calcium phosphate. The crystals develop around the eyelets, balloon and internal lumen of the catheter. [137]</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Debris</h4>
                        <p>Debris is caused by urothelial cells from the bladder or tumours shedding cells, blood from infection, disease, urological surgery or trauma or from mucus.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Biofilm</h4>
                        <p>A thin layer of micro-organism adhering to the surface of a structure, which may be organic or inorganic, together with the polymers that they secrete. [149, 150, 151]</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention and treatment</h4>
                        <p>The evidence base for prevention is weak with some series suggesting that potassium citrate supplementation, increased fluid intake and lemon juice supplements all reduce the incidence and severity of catheter encrustation [143, 152] (LE: 2a) The Cochrane review based on suggests there are no high level evidence studies on prevention. [137] (LE: 1b)</p>
                        <p>In vitro studies suggest that daily bladder washouts (BWO) with EDTA solution may prolong the time to blockage by almost 50% [153] (LE: 2b), although this has not yet been translated into clinical practice and as such cannot be recommended at this stage.</p>
                        <p>Bladder washouts and bladder instillations seem to be more extended in clinical practice than other solutions despite the limited evidence of their effectiveness. (See Chapter 8: Bladder Washout) [85]</p>
                        <p>Further studies have shown that intermittent drainage every 2-4 hours reduces the rate of catheter blockage compared to continuous flow. [58] (LE: 2b)</p>
                        <p>A dependent free draining catheter bag may exert significant syphoning pressure resulting in severe catheter reaction within the bladder urothelium. This polypoidal inflammation in turn may block the catheter holes and result in blockage. (LE: 4) Elevation of the catheter bag to eliminate such pressure may alleviate this risk.</p>
                        <p>Larger catheter lumens also reduce blockage. Silicone catheters appear to be affected by blockage less often than other catheters, which may be explained by the larger lumen, but the material may also be a contributing factor. [144, 145] (LE: 3)</p>

                        <p>Catheter bypassing, occurs in up to 40% of patients with indwelling catheters [146], and may occur as a consequence of various aetiologies including catheter blockage (see section 7.3 above), bladder spasm (see point 7.6 below), constipation, pulling on the catheter or a too large diameter of the catheter. In itself, catheter bypassing is not a diagnosis but rather a symptom, treatment of which should be aimed at the underlying cause.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7.5 Iatrogenic trauma</h3>
                        <p>Iatrogenic trauma during urethral catheterisation may result in either the formation of a false passage, usually at the level of the prostate or bladder neck, urethral stricture disease or traumatic cleaving in the male [154], with sphincteric disruption in the female. (LE: 3) Such trauma is rare, with an overall incidence of 0.3%, decreased by medical and nursing personnel education by up to 78%. [155] (LE: 3) Traumatic cleaving and sphincteric disruption can be avoided by preventing catheter traction or preferably conversion to SPC. (LE: 4) Paraphimosis may occur when an uncircumcised male is catheterised and the prepuce is not replaced. Care and continued patient and carer education will reduce the incidence of such a complication. (LE: 4) 11% of urethral strictures requiring urethroplasty arise following urethral catheterisation. [156] (LE: 3)</p>
                        <p>Suprapubic catheterisation is associated with a potential for visceral injury which although difficult to reliably quantify due to under-reporting, is in the region of 2-3% for bowel perforation, carrying a 30-day mortality rate in the region of 2%. [157, 158, 159] (LE: 3) Visceral trauma is more common amongst patients with previous lower abdominal surgery and in those with neurological disease. [158] (LE: 3)</p>

                        <p>The incidence of visceral trauma during SPC insertion may be reduced by the utilisation of ultrasound to ensure an unhindered route from the skin into the bladder. With training it is possible to detect bowel interposed in the intended path of insertion. (LE: 4) Trauma is also prevented by ensuring there is some urine (300 ml) in the bladder. If there is not sufficient urine in the bladder try to enlarge the volume via the transurethral or oral route. (LE: 4)</p>

                        <p>Cutting the catheter below the bifurcation may result in deflation and allow catheter removal but if this fails, ultrasound guided transabdominal balloon puncture may be required. (LE: 4)</p>
                        <p>Please be aware that cutting the catheter will invalidate product liability. Should this method be employed, it is important to cystoscope the patient to ensure all balloon fragments are removed in order to avoid the potential consequence of calcification around the remaining foreign body with resultant bladder calculus formation. (LE: 3)</p>
                        <p>An alternative method in the event of being unable to remove an SPC is to utilise a flexible cystoscope and attempt balloon perforation with a metal guide wire of fine gauge needle. Again evacuation of all catheter matter is essential. (LE: 4)</p>
                        <p>Transrectal perforation of catheter balloons should be avoided for fear of sepsis. (LE: 4) Formation of a catheter knot in the bladder is a rare cause of catheter-retention, and usually requires endoscopic removal. [164]</p>

                        <p>Chronic catheterisation, in common with other forms of chronic urothelial irritation, may increase the risk of SCC formation. Chronic catheterisation in spinal cord injury patients is the greatest pre-disposing factor for the development of non schistosomiasis induced SCC of the bladder [165], with the only potential way of reducing this risk being to avoid catheterisation is such patients if at all possible.
