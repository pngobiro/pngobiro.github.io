                        <p>The catheter has only one channel for drainage, has no balloon and is available in coated and uncoated versions. This catheter is often referred to as "straight" catheter. This type of catheter is not intended to remain in the bladder for a long period of time but is used for:</p>

                            <li>Intermittent catheterisation and collection of urine representative of the bladder</li>
                            <li>Treating urethral strictures</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">5.1.2 Two-way catheter</h4>
                        <p>In 1853, Jean Francois Reybard developed the first indwelling catheter with an inflated balloon to secure its place in the bladder. One channel is used for urine and one for the balloon. (Fig. 8)</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_18_c8b0123a454977a9fda6g-020-1.jpg" alt="A two-way catheter showing the balloon deflated and inflated." class="content-image">

                        <p>In 1932 Dr. Frederick Foley redesigned this catheter and the Foley catheter is currently the most frequently used device for management of urinary dysfunction. [46]</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">5.1.3 Three-way catheter</h4>
                        <p>Three-way catheters are available with a third channel to facilitate continuous bladder irrigation. This catheter is primarily used following urological surgery or in case of bleeding from a bladder or prostate tumour and the bladder may need continuous or intermittent irrigation to clear blood clots or debris. [47] (Fig. 9)</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_18_c8b0123a454977a9fda6g-020-2.jpg" alt="A three-way catheter with an irrigation channel." class="content-image">

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">5.1.4 Catheter with integrated temperature sensor</h4>
                        <p>A silicone catheter with an integrated temperature sensor is available. (Fig.10) It is a special catheter which is sometimes used within intensive care and during certain surgical procedures. The catheter has a sensor near the tip, to measure the temperature of the urine in the bladder. This is an appropriate means of determining "deep" body or core temperature.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">5.1.5 Suprapubic catheter</h4>
                        <p>The suprapubic catheter is an alternative to the urethral catheter and is inserted into the bladder surgically, often under local anaesthesia. In some countries the procedure is done by a doctor and in other countries by a clinical nurse specialist. Suprapubic catheters can be divided in different types:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Foley balloon catheter; similar to the one used for urethral catheterisation. (Fig. 11)</li>
                            <li>Catheter without a balloon; requires a suture to secure it in place. [48] (Fig. 12)</li>
                            <li>Foley balloon catheter with an open end. (Fig. 13)</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>A catheter with an open end has no "eyes" but an open end tip and is referred to as a "council" tip. This type of catheter can be used when changing a fine bore suprapubic catheter to a long-term catheter and when changing a long-term suprapubic catheter - all procedures over a guide wire.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5.2 Catheter material</h3>
                        <p>Catheters are available in various materials. Issues that should be considered when choosing a catheter are ease of use, tissue compatibility, allergy (latex), tendency for encrustation and formation of biofilm, comfort for the patient, e.g. [49] Some manufacturers produce catheters without phthalates and PVC-free catheters because PVC includes chlorine and plasticisers which are environmentally hazardous.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">5.2.1 Catheters material</h4>
                        <p><strong>Latex</strong></p>
                        <p>Latex, made from natural rubber is a flexible material but it has some disadvantages. Because of the potential discomfort due to high surface friction, vulnerability to rapid encrustation by mineral deposits from the urine and the implication of latex allergic reactions in the development of urethritis and urethral stricture or anaphylaxis, the use of latex catheters is restricted to short-term indwelling and commonly avoided if possible. [21]</p>
                        <p><strong>Silicone</strong></p>
                        <p>The silicone catheter (100% silicone) is very gentle for the tissue and is hypoallergenic. Because it is uncoated it has a relatively large lumen and has a reduced tendency to encrustation. While silicone causes less tissue irritation and potential damages, the catheter balloon has a tendency to lose fluid which increases the risk of displacement. The silicone catheters also have a greater risk for developing a cuff when deflated which can result in uncomfortable catheter removal or urethral trauma. [50] A Cochrane review from 2007 did not find sufficient evidence to determine the best type of indwelling urinary catheter for long-term bladder drainage in adults. [51] However, silicone catheters might be preferable to other catheter materials to reduce the risk of encrustation in long-term catheterised patients.</p>
                        <p><strong>PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene)</strong></p>
                        <p>PTFE-coated latex catheters or Teflon has been developed to protect the urethra against latex. The absorption of water is reduced due to the Teflon coating. It is smoother than plain latex, which helps to prevent encrustation and irritation. Do not use this catheter for patients who are sensitive for latex. [49]</p>
                        <p><strong>Silicone-coated/silicone elastomer-coated</strong></p>
                        <p>Silicone elastomer coated catheters are latex catheters coated inside and out with silicone. The catheter has the strength and flexibility of latex and the durability and reduced encrustation typical of 100% silicone catheters. [52]</p>
                        <p><strong>Hydrogel-coated</strong></p>
                        <p>Hydrogel coated catheters are soft and highly biocompatible. Because they are hydrophilic, they absorb fluid to form a soft cushion around the catheter, and reduce friction and urethral irritations. [52]</p>
                        <p><strong>Silver-coated catheter</strong></p>
                        <p>One type of coating combines a thin layer of silver alloy with hydrogel which is antiseptic. Silver-hydrogel coated catheters are available in latex and silicone. Silver alloy coated catheters significantly reduce the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, but only for less than 1 week. There is some evidence of reduced risk for symptomatic UTI. Therefore, they may be useful in some settings. [12] Another type, silver oxide coated catheters are not associated with a statistically significant reduction in bacteriuria. [21, 45]</p>
                        <p><strong>Nitrofurazone-coated catheter</strong></p>
                        <p>A catheter coated with nitrofurazone is also available. Nitrofurazone should be distinguished from the medicine " Nitrofurantoin". Nitrofurazone is a bactericidal compound which is used as an antibiotic. Antibiotic-impregnated catheters may decrease the frequency of asymptomatic bacteriuria within 1 week. According to Tenke (2008) there is, however, no evidence that antibioticimpregnated catheters decrease symptomatic infection. Therefore, they cannot be recommended routinely. [12, 45] Potential toxicity and/or antibiotic resistance using antimicrobial catheters is unknown. [21] (LE: 4)</p>

                        <p>The inner lumen of the catheter varies quite a lot between different catheter materials e.g. latex and a silicone catheter, so inserting a larger Charrière catheter does not necessarily ensure a wider drainage channel. [48] (Fig. 16)</p>

                        <p>The standard male catheter length of 41-45 cm can be used for males and females, but a shorter female length of 25 cm can be more comfortable and discrete for some women. However, a female catheter can be too short if the woman is severely obese and then a male size is to prefer. The female length catheter should not be used for males as inflation of the balloon within the urethra can result in severe trauma. Paediatric catheters are normally about 30 cm long. [21]</p>

                        <p>The Tiemann catheter with the curved tip is designed to negotiate the male prostatic curve and can be helpful for difficult insertions. [52] The Tiemann indwelling catheter from hard latex for difficult catheterisation is only indicated for short-term use. (Fig. 18)</p>
                        <p>The Coudé tip catheter has a curved tip just like the Tiemann catheter but has one, two or three drainage eyes situated in the curved tip.</p>

                        <p>When the catheter has been placed in the bladder the balloon can be inflated. (Fig. 2) Sterile water or sodium chloride can be used for latex catheters. Inflation of silicone catheters with water can sometimes lead to water loss from the balloon over time, with an associated risk of the catheter falling out. Some manufacturers recommend filling the balloon with a 10% aqueous glycerin solution. [21] Apart from the manufacturers' recommendations there are no studies available about water contra glycerin in the balloon. Some catheter manufacturers provide sterile pre-filled syringes with sterile water or glycerine 10% inside the packing.</p>

                        <p>The balloon size is indicated at the catheter connection behind the size of the catheter as a minimum and maximum ml or cc(cm3) e.g. Ch 12 / 10-15 ml.</p>

                            <li>Balloon size in adult catheters: 5-15 ml, 10 ml for standard use.</li>
                            <li>Balloon size in haematuria catheters: 15-30 ml.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The 30 ml balloon is designed specifically as a haemostat post urological procedure, and should not be used for routine catheterisation. [54]</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the retention balloon is to keep the catheter in place in the bladder. The use of a larger balloon size is mistakenly believed to be a solution to bypassing of urine. [48]</p>
                        <p>Under- or over inflation can cause occlusion of drainage eyes, irritate the bladder wall, and lead to bladder spasms. [52] Furthermore, larger balloons tend to sit higher in the bladder with potential for increased residual urine volumes to collect below the catheter eyes. [21] Always inflate the balloon according to the manufacturer's recommended volume at the packaging and at the inflation valve. [52]</p>
                        <p>Some manufacturers have catheters with an integrated balloon, which means that the balloon is at the same level as the catheter when it is deflated. It can be an advantage when removing a catheter with encrustations, because the encrustations are gathered around the deflated balloon cuff.</p>

                        <p>When the catheter has been inserted using aseptic technique, it is directly connected to the sterile bag, because an aseptic closed drainage system minimises the risk of catheterassociated urinary tract infections (CAUTI). [55] Unnecessary disconnection of a closed drainage system should be avoided, but if it occurs the catheter and collecting system have to be replaced using aseptic technique and sterile equipment. [16]</p>
                        <p>There are several different bags available; selection of the bag depends on whether it is for short-term drainage at the hospital or for long-term use, the patient's mobility, cognitive function, daily life etc. The bags can have a variety of special features:</p>
                        <p>Pre-connected drainage systems are available in which the drainage bag is already connected to a drainage bag in a sterile pack and a tamper-evident seal protects the connection. The use of urinary systems with pre-connected, sealed catheter-tubing junctions may reduce the occurrence of disconnection. [16] (Fig. 21)</p>

                        <p>Anti-reflux valve drainage bags are designed with either an anti-reflux valve or anti-reflux chamber to prevent reflux of contaminated urine from the bag into the tubing. [52] However, complex urinary drainage systems (utilising mechanisms for reducing bacterial entry such as antiseptic-release cartridges in the drain port) are not necessary for routine use. [16]</p>
                        <p>Sampling port: most drainage bags have a special sampling port designed to obtain urine specimens while maintaining a closed system. (Fig. 22) Some companies produce bags with a needle-free sampling port to avoid sharp injury.</p>

                        <p>If the patient is mobile a leg bag can be preferable. The leg bags allow maximum freedom and movement and can be concealed beneath the clothes.

                            <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> ranges from 120 to 800 ml and the size depends on how often the bag has to be emptied according to the patient's daily routines.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chamber:</strong> the bags are available with a single or several chambers. Several chambers flatten the bags profile and are therefore more discreet.</li>

                        <p>Another discreet bag which allows mobility is the body-worn bag as for example the Belly bag® (Fig. 29). The bag can be used with either a suprapubic, a urethral or a nephrostomy catheter, but is not intended to be used with a male external catheter (condom or urosheath) in males. An anti-reflux valve behind the catheter port prevents reflux urine flow, which allows positioning this bag above the level of the bladder, contrary to other bags.</p>

                        <p>Large capacity bags (2-4 litres) can be used post-operatively, if the patient is confined to bed or if the use of a leg bag is not appropriate. Some of the bags with a large capacity are provided with an urimeter which allows accurate measurement of urine in the intensive care patient.</p>
                        <p>Different outlet taps and tube lengths are available as for leg bags (see 5.3.2).</p>
                        <p><strong>Overnight / bedside bag</strong></p>
                        <p>The large capacity bags can be used as a night bag as well. Patients normally require a 2 litre drainage bag that is connected to the leg bag at night or if they are immobile / bedbound. The outlet tap on the leg bag is left open so that the urine collects in the larger bag without breaking the closed drainage system. [56] (Fig. 30) The night bag requires a stand for support, to reduce the risk of dislodging the link system and is available in different designs and materials. [48] (Fig. 31)</p>

                        <p>Over the last few years, technique has changed from sterile to clean in home care setting. In some countries clean, single-use non-drainable night bags are used which means that when the bag is full it has to be changed since the bag cannot be emptied. In other countries, night bags are cleaned and reused for long-term catheters at home. More research is needed to ensure that guidelines and resultant care are based on existing evidence rather than on custom and common practice. [57]</p>

                        <p>Valves are small devices connected to the catheter outlet instead of a bag and are available in a variety of designs. (Fig. 32)</p>

                        <p>The catheter valves are an alternative to leg bags/body-worn bags which give the patient more freedom to move and more discreet drainage. Most valves are designed to fit with linked systems so it is possible to connect to a drainage bag. For example in the night-time, for journeys, etc. [48] The valves provide a well-accepted system of bladder emptying for suitable patients who are able to manipulate the valve mechanism and empty the bladder regularly to avoid overfilling. Another advantage is that the valve offers the potential for maintenance of bladder function, capacity and tone by allowing the filling and emptying of the bladder. [21] Furthermore, research has shown that using a catheter valve with a two to four-hourly release has been associated with reduced catheter blockage. [58] The valve is not an optimal solution for all patients and the nurse specialist has to assess the suitability for each patient. However, in some countries the use of catheter valves is not approved.</p>

                            <li>Urethral reflux or renal impairment</li>
                            <li>Small or limited bladder capacity; the valve would have to be opened very often</li>
