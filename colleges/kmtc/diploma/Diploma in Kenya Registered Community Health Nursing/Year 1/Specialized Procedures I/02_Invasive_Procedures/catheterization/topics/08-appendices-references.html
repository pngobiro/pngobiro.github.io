                            <li>Management and maintenance of three-way Foley catheter (Fig. 40) involves a closed drainage system and sterile technique;</li>
                            <li>Saline solution for infusion should be stored and infused at room temperature to avoid bladder spasms;</li>
                            <li>Strict "Intake and Output" is recommended for all patients receiving Continuous Bladder Irrigation (CBI). Special attention to frail elderly and/or history of pelvic floor or bladder radiation should be paid. These patients are at high risk for bladder perforation.</li>

                                    <li>Cleanse the catheter opening. Use nothing smaller than a 60 ml syringe and sterile saline (Fig. 41);</li>
                                    <li>Use slow, even pressure to avoid damaging the bladder wall. Do not force if resistance is met;</li>
