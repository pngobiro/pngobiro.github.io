                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In clinical practice the most extendedly used terms are "manual washout or bladder lavage" defined as the washing out of the bladder with sterile fluid and "bladder irrigation" as the continuous washing out of the bladder with sterile fluid. [166, 167, 168] Bladder instillations appear to have several indications, one of them is to prevent or treat catheter blockages. Furthermore, instillation treatments are not limited to saline or citric acid solutions; there are some others such as chemotherapy drugs (i.e. mitomycin-C or epirubicin) or antiinflammatory drugs (i.e. hyaluronic acid), to reduce toxicity of brachytherapy [169] or vesicoureteral reflux. [170]</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">8.1 Washout policies/catheter maintenance in long-term urethral catheterisation</h3>
                        <p>People requiring long-term bladder draining with an indwelling catheter can experience catheter blockage. As there are quite a few causes of catheter blockage (e.g. kinks in a tube, constipation, catheter against bladder wall, encrustation, debris) it is important to diagnose the exact reason for the blockage in order to decide the correct course of treatment.</p>
                        <p>Regiments involving different solutions are being used to wash out catheters with the aim of preventing blockage. Hagen et al, 2010 [137] conducted a Cochrane review comparing washout versus no washout, different washout solutions, frequency, duration, volume, concentration, method of administration in any setting with an indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter for more than 28 days.</p>
                        <p>Hagen et al, 2010 found only 5 relevant articles; all these concluded that there was no evidence that washouts were helpful. It was stated that trials were sparse and generally of poor quality or poorly reported, and that the evidence was too scanty to conclude whether or not washouts were beneficial.</p>
                        <p>Despite this conclusion, in daily practice bladder washouts are still often recommended in special circumstances, such as removal of encrustation in certain long-term indwelling catheters or removal of blood clots after urological surgery or in palliative treatment of intractable haematuria. [171 in 137, 172] As stated in the Cochrane review [45, 137] there is no evidence how long, and what kind of solutions should be given. So, bladder washout / catheter maintenance is an option to be discussed with the patient and the clinical team on an individual patient basis. [173] Based on the evidence the working group only recommends bladder washout in bleeding and certain urological surgical procedures.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Urinalysis should not be routinely performed on all long-term catheterised patients, as virtually all patients will have bacteria present in their urine. [174]</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Indications</h4>
                        <p>Urinalysis / catheter specimen of urine (CSU) should be undertaken when:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Patient is systemically unwell</li>
                            <li>Patient has a high temperature</li>
                            <li>Following lack of response to treatment</li>
                            <li>Admitted/transferred to hospital to ascertain the presence of HAI or CAI (hospital or community acquired infection). [23]</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Technique</h4>
                        <p>Urine samples from a catheter must be obtained under aseptic technique from the needle free sampling port by syringe aspiration. [16] The sampling port has been specially designed to re-seal after aspiration of the urine sample. [175] Obtain large volumes of urine for special analyses (not culture) aseptically from the drainage bag. [16] (LE: 1b) If the indwelling catheter has been in place for more than 7 days, the catheter should be changed, and the urine should be collected from the new catheter so the sample is representative of the microorganisms really present in the bladder and not the microorganisms that have adhered to the interior wall of the catheter. [45]</p>
                        <p>For the procedure of Obtaining a urine sample from an indwelling catheter, see Appendix P.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Dipstick</h4>
                        <p>Bacterial colonisation with catheterisation is inevitable with almost 100% colonisation risk at 7-10 days [42] and does not require therapy in asymptomatic individuals, the use of dipstick to detect UTI is not recommended. If dipstick is used to detect glucose in the urine, attention should be paid that uric acid and vitamin C can cause a false-negative result. [176]</p>

                        <p>Drinking sufficient fluid dilutes the urine and helps reduce the risk of catheter encrustation and blockage. A good fluid intake also ensures a constant downward drainage and flushing effect. There is no standard amount of advised fluid intake and the type of fluid consumed appears to be insignificant as long as the volume is sufficient to prevent concentration of urine The amount of fluid needed varies and depends on patient's size (25-35 ml/kg/day), amount of fluid loss, patient's food intake and patients circulatory and renal status. Regular fluid intake maintains the urinary flow and reduces the risk of infection and catheter blockage. The patient should be given sufficiently fluid to maintain an output of 50-100 ml/h.

                        <p>Cranberries have been used for several decades for the prevention and treatment of UTI. Cranberries comprise nearly 90% water and also contain various organic substances such as quinic acid, malic acid and citric acid as well as glucose and fructose. No definite mechanism of actin has been established for cranberry in the prevention or treatment of UTIs. The main suggestion is that cranberries prevent bacteria from sticking to uroepithelial cells that line the wall of the bladder. [116] A Cochrane review identified 10 studies comparing cranberry products with placebo, juice or water and found that cranberries can prevent recurrent infection in women, but there is no evidence that cranberries are effective in people who need catheterisation. [116] Another study tested the effect of cranberry juice on encrustation and blockage by biofilms, which also may cause UTI because bacteriuria is inevitably associated with encrustation. This study found that drinking cranberry juice did not produce urine that was inhibitory to the development of biofilms.</p>
                        <p>Beside the ineffectiveness of preventing UTI, attention should be paid to the interaction between cranberry and warfarin. Studies indicates that cranberry may potentiate the effect of warfarin. [178]</p>
