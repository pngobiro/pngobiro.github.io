                        <p>The European Association of Urology Nurses (EAUN) was created in April 2000 to represent European urological nurses. The EAUN's underlying goal is to foster the highest standards of urological nursing care throughout Europe. With administrative, financial and advisory support from the European Association of Urology (EAU), the EAUN also encourages research and aspires to develop European standards for education and accreditation of urology nurses.</p>
                        <p>We believe that excellent healthcare goes beyond geographical boundaries. Improving current standards of urological nursing care has been top of our agenda, with the aim of directly helping our members develop or update their expertise. To fulfill this essential goal, we are publishing the latest addition to our Evidence-based Guidelines for Best Practice in Urological Health Care series, a comprehensive compilation of theoretical knowledge and practical guidelines on indwelling catheters. Although there is considerable literature on indwelling catheters, to our knowledge prior to this publication there was only limited evidence-based guidance for nurses available on this topic. The EAUN Guidelines Group believes there is a need to provide guidelines with recommendations clearly stating the level of evidence of each procedure with the aim of improving current practices and delivering a standard and reliable protocol.</p>
                        <p>In this booklet, we have included clear illustrations, extensive references and annotated procedures to help nurses to identify potential problem areas and efficiently carry out possible options for effective patient care. The working group decided to include topics such as indications and contraindications, equipment, nursing principles and interventions in the topic, catheter related care as well as instruction to patients and caregivers. We would also like to highlight the psychological and social aspects unique to the experience of patients with indwelling catheters as aspects which have a profound influence on the patient's quality of life.</p>
                        <p>With our emphasis on delivering these guidelines based on a consensus process, we intend to support nurses and practitioners who are already assessed as competent in this procedure. Although these guidelines aim to be comprehensive, effective practice can only be achieved if the nurse or practitioner has a clear and thorough knowledge of the anatomy under discussion and the necessary grasp and understanding of basic nursing principles.</p>
                        <p>This publication focuses on indwelling catheters both suprapubic and urethral. The guidelines only describe the procedure and material in adults and not for children. Furthermore, these guidelines are intended to complement, or provide support to, established clinical practice and should be used within the context of local policies and existing protocols.</p>
                        <p>This text is made available to all individual EAUN members, both electronically and in print. The full text can be accessed on the EAU website (http://www.uroweb.org/nurses/nursingguidelines/) and the EAUN website (www.eaun.uroweb.org). Hard copies can be ordered through the EAU website via the webshop (https://www.uroweb.org/publications/eaun-goodpractice/) or by e-mail (eaun@uroweb.org).</p>

                        <p>The EAUN is a professional organisation of European nurses who have specialised in urological care. In Europe, there is a great variation in the education and competency of nurses in urology, with urological nurses having different activities and roles in various countries. It is therefore difficult for any guideline to fulfil all requirements. However, the EAUN Guidelines Working Group has tried to ensure that every nurse and health care professional may gain some benefit from using these guidelines.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The EAUN Guidelines Working Group for indwelling catheters have prepared this guideline document to help nurses assess the evidence-based management of catheter care and to incorporate the guidelines' recommendations into their clinical practice. These guidelines are not meant to be proscriptive, nor will adherence to these guidelines guarantee a successful outcome in all cases. Ultimately, decisions regarding care must be made on a case-by-case basis by healthcare professionals after consultation with their patients using their clinical judgement, knowledge and expertise.</p>
                        <p>The expert panel consists of a multi-disciplinary team of nurse specialists and a urologist (see 'About the authors', chapter 16). Obviously in different countries, even in different areas, titles will differ within the speciality. For the purpose of this document we will refer to all nurses who are working with indwelling catheters as nurse specialists (NS).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.1 Literature search</h3>
                        <p>The information offered in this guideline was obtained through a systematic literature search and through review of current procedures undertaken in various member countries of the EAUN. All group members participated in the critical assessment of the scientific papers identified. Bibliographical databases consulted included Embase, Medline and the Cochrane library database CENTRAL. The search was based on the keywords (listed below). The question for which the references were searched was: "Is there any evidence for indwelling catheterisation for nursing interventions in different care situations such as preparation, insertion or care of indwelling catheters as well as catheter materials or complications?" Both Embase and Medline were searched using both 'Free text' and the respective thesauri MeSH and EMTREE. The time frame covered in the searches was January 2000 - September 2010. If a topic was not covered by the results of the search, earlier references were used. Additional search on bags, deflation of the balloon, valves, removal of the catheter and stabilisation was carried out by the Working Group.</p>
                        <p>Whenever possible, the Guidelines Working Group have graded treatment recommendations using a three-grade recommendation system (A to C ) and inserted levels of evidence to help readers assess the validity of the statements made. The aim of this practice is to ensure a clear transparency between the underlying evidence and a recommendation given. This system is further described in the Tables 1 and 2. (see section 2.8)</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.2 Limitations of the search</h3>
                        <p>The search was performed in September 2010. In Medline and Embase the search results were limited to randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in Central to Controlled Clinical Trials and to meta-analysis and systematic reviews. In all databases, output was limited to human studies and English language publications.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.4 Search results</h3>
                        <p>EAUN commissioned a company to do an initial search on catheterisation which resulted in a total of 1,086 abstracts from scientific publications. After reading the abstracts, 242 were left and full text articles of them were made available to the working group. It was a policy decision to restrict the search in this way, though the group were aware that more complex strategies were possible, and would be encouraged in the context of a formal systematic review. In the process of working with the articles new references were found and added to the reference list, if they were relevant for the topic and cited in the text. Additionally, scientific articles mentioned by the reviewers in November 2011 and considered useful by the working group, were included.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.5 Disclosures</h3>
                        <p>The EAUN Guidelines Working Group members have provided disclosure statements of all relationships that might be a potential source of conflict of interest. The information has been stored in the EAU database. This Guidelines document was developed with the financial support of the EAU.</p>
                        <p>The EAUN is a non-profit organisation and funding is limited to administrative assistance and travel and meeting expenses. No honoraria or other reimbursements have been provided.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.6 Limitations of document</h3>
                        <p>The EAUN acknowledge and accept the limitations of this document. It has to be emphasised that current guidelines provide information about the treatment of an individual patient according to a standardised approach. The information should be considered as providing recommendations without legal implications. The intended readership is the pan-European practising urology nurse and nurses working in a related field.</p>
                        <p>Cost-effectiveness considerations and non-clinical questions are best addressed locally and therefore fall outside the remit of these guidelines. Other stakeholders, except patient representatives, have not been involved in producing this document.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.7 Review process</h3>
                        <p>The Working Group included an extensive number of topics, which are not always only applicable to catheterisation, but decided to include them because they make the guideline more complete. A blinded review was carried out by specialised nurses and urologists in various countries. The Working Group revised the document based on the comments received. A final version was approved by the EAUN Board and the EAU Executive responsible for EAUN activities.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="section-2.8">2.8 Rating system</h3>
                        <p>The recommendations provided in these documents are based on a rating system modified from that produced by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine. [1] Some of the literature was not easy to grade. If, however, the EAUN Working Group thought the information would be useful in practice, it is ranked as level of evidence 4 and grade of recommendation C . Low level evidence indicates that no higher level evidence was found in the literature when writing this guideline, but cannot be regarded as an indication of the importance of the topic or recommendation for daily practice.</p>

                        <p>The evidence-based nursing definition from Behrens 2004 says: "Integration of the latest, highest level scientific research into the daily nursing practice, with regard to theoretical knowledge, nursing experience, the ideas of the patient and available resources". [2] There are 4 components for nursing decisions: personal clinical experience from the nurse, existing resources, patient wishes and ideas and results of nursing science. [3] This citation states that not only the literature is relevant, but that also the experience of nurses as well as of patients is necessary for decision making. Subsequently, it is not only the written guideline that is relevant for nursing practice.</p>
