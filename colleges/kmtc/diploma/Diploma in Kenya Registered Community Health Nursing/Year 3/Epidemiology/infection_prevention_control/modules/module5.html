                <div class="content-block">
                   <p>1. <b>Routine hand washing using plain soap and running water</b></p>
                     <p>Routine hand washing removes transient micro-organisms and soil, blood or other organic material from the hands. This method is appropriate in most situations and the hands should be washed frequently as possible.</p>
                     <p>2. <b>Hand washing with antiseptic and running water</b></p>
                    <p>In this method, transient micro-organisms and soil are removed. It kills or inhibits the growth of resident micro-organisms. Moreover, it may reduce the risk of infections in high risk situations, such as:</p>
                      <ul>
                            <li>When there is heavy microbial contamination</li>
                            <li>Before performing invasive procedures such as vein punctures and other aseptic procedures</li>
                            <li>Before contact with patients who have immune defects, for example, patients with burns, leukaemia etc.</li>

                    <p>3. <b>Alcohol hand rub</b></p>
                   <p>Alcohol hand rub kills or inhibits the growth of most transient and resident micro-organisms but does not remove all micro-organisms or soil. It can be used when hand washing with soap and running water is not possible as long as hands are not visibly soiled with dirt, blood or other organic material.</p>
                   <p>4. <b>Surgical hand scrub</b></p>
                   <p>Scrubbing with antiseptic before beginning surgical procedures will help prevent the growth of micro-organisms for a period of time. It will also reduce the risk of infections to the patient if the gloves are damaged.</p>

                    <p>You should wash your hands with antimicrobial soap or an antiseptic solution which should then be followed by good rinsing under running water. This is a more effective method of removing and killing transient micro-organisms.</p>
                   <p>Vigorously rub soaped hands for 15-30 seconds and then rinse under running water. Plain water removes 50% of transient micro-organisms, while soap removes 80-90% of micro-organisms.</p>
                     <p>After washing your hands you should dry them with a clean towel or air dry them. Be aware that shared towels can become contaminated quickly.</p>
