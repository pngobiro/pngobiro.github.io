                <div class="content-block">
                   <p>Think about how you can maintain a safe environment in the surgical/procedure area. You are aware that specific rooms have been designed for performing surgical/clinical procedures and processing instruments and other items.</p>
                   <p>You often hear of dressing room or treatment room, autoclaving room and so on. In these rooms traffic is controlled. Other activities are minimised or prohibited. This is because the number of people and amount of activity in them influences the number of micro-organisms and the risk of infections. You must therefore:</p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Limit the entry of unauthorised individuals to surgical/procedure areas</li>
                         <li>Close doors and curtains during all procedures</li>
                         <li>Require that personnel in the surgical area wear clean clothes, a mask, a cap and sturdy footwear</li>
                         <li>Enclose surgical procedure area to minimise dust and eliminate insects</li>
                         <li>Air-condition the room if feasible</li>
                         <li>Disinfect and clean examination/operating tables, instrument trolleys, light handles and any other surfaces that may have been contaminated with blood or other body fluids during a procedure before bringing in a new patient into the room</li>

                <h2>üìö Use and Disposal of Sharps</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                     <p>You are aware that careless disposal of contaminated sharps can cause infections in the health care facility and the community. Make hypodermic needles and other sharps unusable by incinerating them.</p>
                    <p>Alternatively the risk of infections can be reduced by decontaminating sharps before disposal, and burying them in a pit to make it difficult for others to scavenge them.</p>
                    <p>Decontamination is performed by soaking instruments and other items immediately after use, in 0.5% Chlorine solution for ten minutes. Decontamination is done in order to kill viruses (such as Hepatitis B, other hepatitis viruses and HIV) and many other micro-organisms, making instruments and other items easier to clean by preventing blood, other body fluids and tissue from drying on them</p>
                    <p>Disposing of Sharps</p>
                    <p>Sharps such as needles, scalpels and so on, are to be handled with extreme caution to avoid injuries during use, disposal or reprocessing. Used needles should not be recapped by hand. If necessary use the single hand ‚Äúscoop‚Äù method. With one hand, hold the syringe and use the needle to "scoop up" the cap.</p>
                   <p>Used needles should not be bent or broken after use.</p>
                    <p><b>Do not remove the needle from the syringe by hand. Dispose of the needle and attached syringe in a puncture-resistant sharps disposal container</b></p>
                     <p>A sharps disposal container may be a heavy cardboard box or an empty plastic or metal container. At all times obey the following rules:</p>
