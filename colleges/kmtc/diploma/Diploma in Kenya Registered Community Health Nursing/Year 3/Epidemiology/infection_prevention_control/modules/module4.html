                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Standard precautions are a set of clinical practice recommendations designed to help minimise the risk of exposure to infectious materials, such as blood and other body fluids by both patients and staff.</p>
                    <p>They help break the disease transmission cycle at the mode of transmission step.</p>
                   <p>A standard procedure is a procedure that should be followed routinely at all times. It should apply to every patient regardless of their presumed infection status. This is because you will not be able to tell who is infected with viruses such as HIV or hepatitis. Even the infected persons themselves may not know that they are infected. You should therefore follow the standard precautions when dealing with every patient.</p>
                   <p>You will now cover these precautions in more detail.</p>

                 <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Washing your hands before and after contact with each patient is the single most effective method of preventing/decreasing transfer of micro-organisms between you and the patients within a health facility. This method is easy to follow and is an inexpensive procedure.</p>
                     <p>The purpose of hand washing is to remove soil, organic material and transient micro-organisms from the skin.</p>
