                 <div class="content-block">
                     <p>Barrier nursing is an intervention in nursing practice that aims at preventing cross infection of communicable diseases and the spread of an infectious agent from an infected or colonized patient to susceptible persons. The term "barrier nursing" is given to a method of nursing care that has been used for over one hundred years when caring for a patient known or thought to be suffering from a contagious disease such as open pulmonary tuberculosis. It is sometimes called "bedside isolation."</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>As the name implies, the aim is to erect a barrier to the passage of infectious pathogenic organisms between the contagious patient and other patients and staff in the hospital. Preferably, all contagious patients are admitted in separate rooms, but when such patients must be nursed in a ward with others, screens are placed around the bed or beds they occupy.</p>
                     <p>This would prevent the spread of communicable diseases through various routes such as faecal oral route to other patients, healthcare workers, and the community.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                   <p>The following are some of the diseases that would warrant barrier nursing:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Open pulmonary tuberculosis</li>
                        <li>Typhoid</li>
                         <li>Amoebic and bacillary dysentery</li>
                         <li>Gastro intestinal anthrax</li>
                        <li>Hepatitis A</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>It is important to note that highly infectious diseases such as Ebola should isolated in a separate room or be nursed in an isolation ward with very strict standard operation procedures.</p>
