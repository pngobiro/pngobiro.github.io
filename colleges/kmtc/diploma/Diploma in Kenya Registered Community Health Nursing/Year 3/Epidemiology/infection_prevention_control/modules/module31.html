                 <div class="content-block">
                     <p>Before deciding to apply nursing barrier nursing to a patient, careful consideration must be given to the following:</p>
                      <ul>
                            <li>Patient's clinical condition (e.g. mental health status)</li>
                            <li>Mode of transmission of the infection (airborne, feacal‚Äìoral etc)</li>
                            <li>Availability of supplies</li>
                             <li>Susceptibility of others to the infection</li>
                             <li>Evidence based practice eg laboratory report</li>
                            <li>Safety of healthcare providers</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Apart from the above considerations, the nurse should have the following in mind when carrying out barrier nursing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Involvement of the patient and significant others in decision making before moving the patient for barrier nursing to have their cooperation and support</li>
                           <li>Barrier nursing should be comfortable and friendly</li>
                           <li>The care should be inexpensive with minimal interference with the patient care</li>
                       </ul>

                 <div class="content-block">
                    <p>In health care, creating a barrier for a patient involves various measures taken to prevent the spread of contagious diseases from patient to patient, patient to staff and visitors. The influence to the type of measure taken depend on, the ease upon which the micro-organisms is transmitted, the route of transmission, the epidemiological significance of the organism and extent to which other susceptible host may be exposed</p>
                    <p>The nurses wear gowns, masks, and sometimes rubber gloves and they observe strict rules that minimize the risk of passing on infectious agents to others. All equipment and utensils used for the care of the patients are immediately sterilized as per the set standard operational procedure.</p>
                    <p>The nurses should observe standards of cleanliness in hand washing after they have handled the patient. Bedding is carefully moved in order to minimize the transmission of airborne particles, such as dust or droplets that could carry contagious material</p>

                <h2>üìö Limitations of Traditional Barrier Nursing</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                   <p>Barrier nursing often failed its objective, especially in hospital wards of the traditional "Nightingale" pattern, with rows of beds lined up on two or more sides of a large room. Airborne and droplet infection all too frequently penetrated the imperfect barrier, and sometimes even feacal-oral infectious agents found ways to invade the imperfect protective measures intended to block their passage.</p>
                   <p>Late in the twentieth century, barrier nursing has been superseded by more effective and more rigorous universal precautions.</p>
