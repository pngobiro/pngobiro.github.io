                     <p>When it comes to micro biological control of the health care facility environment it relies on maintenance of smooth, dry and intact surfaces, prompt cleaning of spillage of body fluids, secretions and excretions and prompt removal of these substances from patient treatment areas.</p>
                     <p>Cleaning and maintenance prevent the build up of soil, dust or other foreign material that can harbour pathogens and support their growth. Cleaning is accomplished with water, detergents and mechanical action. It reduces or eliminates the reservoirs of potential pathogenic micro-organisms.</p>
                    <p>Warm, soapy water is adequate for cleaning areas not directly involved in patient care such as offices and duty rooms.</p>
