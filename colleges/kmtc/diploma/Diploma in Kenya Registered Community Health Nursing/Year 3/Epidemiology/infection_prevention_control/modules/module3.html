                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>In the health care setting infection can be transmitted:</p>
                    <ul>
                         <li>When the health care worker's skin is pierced or cut by contaminated needles or other sharp instruments</li>
                        <li>When the health care worker's broken skin (cuts, scratches, rashes, chapped skin, fungal infections) comes into contact with the patient's blood or other body fluids</li>
                        <li>When the patient's blood or other body fluids are splashed on the healthcare worker's mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth)</li>
                    </ul>
                   <p>All cases of transmission of Hepatitis B and HIV from patients to health care workers have occurred through accidents such as needle stick injuries. Furthermore, as a health worker you can spread infections from one patient to another and from patients to yourself, your family and the community.</p>
                    <p>Infectious diseases could be minimised or eliminated by adhering to medical principles and practices that reduce cross infection in healthcare settings. The spread of most infections can be controlled by observing basic infection prevention control guidelines and proper and adequate treatment of primary cases.</p>
                    <p>The WHO's guidelines demand that you should treat all patients as potentially infectious. Furthermore, WHO stipulates proper precaution and use of correct and appropriate protective gear when dealing with or handling blood and blood products, body fluids or contaminated equipment.</p>
                    <p>According to WHO guidelines, you should:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Observe and maintain good personal hygiene and wear appropriate attire.</li>
                        <li>Be vaccinated against vaccine preventable conditions, especially if you are working in high risk areas.</li>
                        <li>If you work in vulnerable areas, for example areas where you handle cooked food, you should be periodically screened for certain diseases, such as typhoid.</li>
                         <li>If you are suffering from infectious conditions and you are working with susceptible patients, for example, in an operating room, special care baby unit, or the ICU burns unit, you should be re-deployed until you are cleared of the infection.</li>

                    <p>How can you spread infections from one patient to another or to your family and community?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you do not wash your hands before and after contact with patients, or when you do not wash your hands before leaving the health facility and then touch members of your family or household items</li>
                        <li>When you use surgical instruments, such as needles, syringes and other equipment that have not been processed properly</li>
                       <li>When medical waste is not disposed of properly, members of the community may come into contact with that waste</li>
                       <li>When you contaminate your clothing or hair in the course of rendering care to patients</li>
                        <li>When you contract infections and spread them to some members of your family, they will in turn spread them to other members of the family, who in turn will spread them to others in the community</li>

                    <p>The mode of transmission is the easiest point at which to break the disease transmission cycle.

                     <p>The focus of infection prevention is to the utilisation of procedures and techniques in the surveillance investigation and compilation of statistical data in order to minimise the spread of infection.</p>
                   <p> The goal of infection prevention is to minimise post procedure infections in patients and prevent transmission of life threatening infections to patients, service providers, auxiliary staff and members of the community (AVSC 1999).</p>
