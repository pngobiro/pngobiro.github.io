                    <p>Use washable, leak proof containers for disposal of medical waste in rooms and procedure rooms.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plastic or galvanised metal containers with covers are the best type because they are not likely to corrode. Use small receptacles that use step on levers/pedals to open the cover.</li>
                        <li>Always keep waste containers in convenient places for users.</li>
                        <li>Empty the container daily or when it is three quarters full.</li>
                        <li>Never put hands into containers with medical waste.</li>
                        <li>Always dispose of medical waste correctly; never simply throw it outside or leave it in an open pile.</li>
                         <li>Always wear heavy utility gloves and shoes when handling and transporting medical waste.</li>
                         <li>Wash both the gloves and your hands afterwards.</li>
                          <li>Wash containers used for medical waste with a disinfectant cleaning solution and rinse them with water daily (or move often if they are visibly contaminated after the medical waste is dumped).</li>

                   <p><b>Disposal of Sharps, Liquid Medical Waste and Hazardous Chemical Waste</b></p>
                    <p>Sharps, liquid medical waste, and hazardous chemical waste require special disposal procedures.</p>
                     <p>a. <b>Sharps</b></p>
                     <p>All used sharps are to be disposed of in puncture resistant containers. Puncture resistant containers can be made out of a heavy cardboard box, an empty plastic jug or a metal container.</p>
                     <p>Sharps containers should be located close to the place in which procedures are performed so that staff do not have to walk across the room carrying used sharps. Keep a sharps disposal container in the laundry in case sharps are found in linen.</p>
                      <p>Close sharps containers securely when they are three quarters full. If the containers become full, people may push the sharps into the containers, which may cause injury</p>
                     <p>Sharps are not destroyed by burning, therefore, you need to render them harmless by placing needles, plastic syringes and scalpels in a metal container. Then, when the container is three quarters full, pour in fuel, ignite and burn it until the fire goes out on its own. Plastic syringes will melt and, when they cool, become a solid block of plastic, with the sharps embedded in the block. The block can then be buried.</p>
                </div>

             <section class="content-section">
                <h2>üìö Disposal of Liquid and Hazardous Waste</h2>
                 <div class="content-block">
                    <p>b. <b>Liquid Medical Waste</b></p>
                    <p>When carrying or disposing of liquid medical waste, be careful to avoid splashing the waste on yourself, other people or surfaces. Carefully pour liquid waste down a sink, drain, flushable toilet or latrine. If this is not possible bury it in a pit. Rinse the sink, drain, or toilet thoroughly with water to remove residual waste, again avoiding splashing. Clean with a disinfectant cleaning solution at the end of each day, or more frequently if heavily used or soiled.</p>
                     <p>Decontaminate the container that held the liquid waste by filling it with a 0.5% chlorine solution and soaking it for 10 minutes before washing. Always wear heavily utility gloves and shoes when handling or transporting liquid medical waste. Wash both the gloves before ungloving and your hands afterwards.</p>
                    <p>c. <b>Hazardous Chemical Waste</b></p>
                     <p>Cleaning solutions and disinfectants, such as glutaraldehyde, should be handled as described for liquid medical waste. Rinse containers thoroughly with water, wash glass containers with detergent and water, rinse thoroughly, and reuse. Do not reuse plastic containers. Always wear heavy utility gloves and shoes when handling or transporting hazardous chemical waste. Wash both the gloves and your hands afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Disposing of cytotoxic chemicals and radioactive waste requires special consideration beyond the scope of this training course.</p>
