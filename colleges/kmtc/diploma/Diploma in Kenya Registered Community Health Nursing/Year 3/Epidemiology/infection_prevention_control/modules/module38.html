                   <p><b>APPLICATION OF NURSING PROCESS TO BARRIER NURSING</b></p>
                   <p>Barrier nursing is an intervention where the care plan for a patient includes the following:</p>
                     <ul>
                          <li>Assessment of the patient which is done to make a decision to start barrier nursing. This will involve getting information about the present condition through records, laboratory results, past history, family history and other relevant sources of information.</li>
                        <li>Analyze the collected information eg abdominal pain, vomiting and come up with a nursing diagnosis which would lead to a decision for barrier nursing for the patient.</li>
                        <li>Define each nursing diagnosis and relate to each condition eg passing of loose feacal matter.</li>
                         <li>List all interventions and explain or give a rationale for each intervention to be taken to improve the condition of the patient.</li>
                         <li>Evaluate the condition of the patient based on the outcome of the listed interventions and make a decision of either to continue or discontinue barrier nursing.</li>
                     </ul>
                    <p>It is important to note that when planning for barrier nursing other relevant cadres should be involved in planning and implementation. This is in an effort to provide effective and efficient barrier nursing care. In addition, team approach to care would provide a comprehensive assessment of the patient and holistic care of a patient for barrier nursing through various individual clinical specialties.</p>
