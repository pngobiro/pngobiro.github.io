                    <p>The goal of infection prevention is to minimise post procedure infections in patients and prevent transmission of life threatening infections to patients, service providers, auxiliary staff and members of the community (AVSC 1999).</p>

                <h2>üìö The Concept of Infectious Diseases</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                   <p>Over the past few decades Kenya has experienced a drastic change in the pattern of infectious diseases. Some of those that had been eradicated are re-emerging, and new ones are being identified e.g Corona ‚Äì COVID-19.</p>
                   <p>There have also been sporadic outbreaks of diseases such as cholera, measles, the plague, and yellow fever among others.</p>
                    <p>New viruses such as the Hepatitis B and C have become increasingly common. The situation has been made worse by the fact that some micro-organisms are rapidly developing resistance to common antibiotics. Hospital acquired infections are on the increase. This drug resistance, combined with the high HIV/AIDS prevalence, makes infection prevention and control extremely important.</p>
                   <p>The World Health Organisation WHO (1996) observes that millions of people all over the world suffer and even die of hospital acquired infections which have become known as nosocomial infections.</p>
                    <p>These hospital acquired diseases range from trivial to life threatening conditions such as septicaemia. It is thought that this spread may be due to the advance in medicine that exposes patients to more surgical and medical invasive procedures which increase the risk of infection. It is important to note that shortage of resources may have contributed to some nosocomial infections.</p>
                     <p>Globally the most frequent infections are: surgical wounds infection, lower respiratory tract and urinary tract infections. The emergence of highly infectious diseases such as the Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers (VHF) also increases the risk of hospital acquired infection.</p>
                    <p>Health care facilities are ideal settings for the transmission of infections because the invasive procedures routinely performed on patients have the potential of introducing micro-organisms into the body.</p>
