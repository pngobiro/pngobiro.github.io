                    <p>These are areas such as walls, ceilings and floors. Clean walls and ceilings with water and detergent using a damp cloth.</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Ensure routine damp dusting is performed. Always keep surfaces dry. Wipe chairs, lamps, tabletops and counters with a damp cloth, water and detergent.</li>

                    <p>To clean sinks, use a disinfectant cleaning solution with a cloth or brush, then rinse with clean water.</p>
                    <p>When cleaning toilets and latrines, wear utility gloves and rubber boots. Use a disinfectant cleaning solution, scrub daily or as required with a separate cloth or brush.</p>
                    <p>Wear rubber gloves when cleaning waste containers. Use a detergent solution, scrub to remove soil and organic material. As a supervisor you may be required to demonstrate what you would wish to be done.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                   <p>Solutions used for cleaning in a health facility include</p>
                     <p>a. <b>Plain Detergent and Water</b></p>
                    <p>This is used for low risk areas and general cleaning tasks. Detergents remove dirt and organic material and dissolve or suspend grease and oil which can then easily be removed by scrubbing</p>
                      <p>b. <b>0.5% Sodium Hypochloride Solution</b></p>
                     <p> (disinfectant solution)</p>
                     <p>Disinfectants rapidly kill or inactivate micro-organisms during the cleaning process. They are also used to decontaminate an area so that it is safer for staff to clean. Other alternative disinfectants containing 5% carbolic acid such as phenol or lysol can be used.</p>
                      <p>c. <b>Disinfectant/Detergent Cleaning Solution</b></p>
                      <p>This solution contains a disinfectant, a detergent and water. It is used for cleaning areas that may be contaminated with infectious materials.</p>
                       <p>The solution must contain both a disinfectant and a detergent. Disinfectants rapidly kill or inactivate infectious micro-organisms during the cleaning process. Detergents, on the other hand, remove dirt and organic material, which cannot be done by water or disinfectants alone</p>
                    <p>Your responsibility will therefore include providing adequate resources such as brooms, dusting cloths, detergents, disinfectants and protective gear for the supportive staff who are charged with the cleaning of the health facility.</p>
                    <p>You will also need to supervise and guide them appropriately so that the health facility remains clean at all items.</p>
                     <p>Always wear gloves, preferably heavy utility gloves, and sturdy shoes when cleaning.</p>
