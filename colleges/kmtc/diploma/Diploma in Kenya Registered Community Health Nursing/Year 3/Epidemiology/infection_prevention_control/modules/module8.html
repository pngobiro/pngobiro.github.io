                 <div class="content-block">
                     <p>An antiseptic is a chemical agent used on the skin and mucous membrane to remove or kill micro-organisms without causing damage or irritation to the skin and mucous membranes. An antiseptic may also prevent the growth and development of micro-organisms.</p>
                     <p>Antiseptics are not meant to be used on inanimate objects, such as instruments and surfaces (AVSC, 1999). You can use antiseptics for surgical hand scrub, skin preparation as well as cervical and vaginal preparation before a clinical procedure.</p>
                    <p>Disinfectants are chemical agents used to kill micro-organisms on inanimate objects, such as instruments and surfaces. Disinfectants are not meant to be used on the skin or mucous membranes (AVSC, 1999).</p>
                    <p>There are two types of disinfectants: high level and low level.</p>

             <section class="content-section">
                <h2>üìö High Level Disinfectants</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                     <p>High level disinfectants kill bacteria, viruses, fungi and some bacterial endospores. Some high level disinfectants can be used to sterilise equipment and if given sufficient time to act, they are able to destroy bacterial endospores that cause diseases such as tetanus and gas gangrene. Bacterial endospores are difficult to kill because of their protective casing or coating.</p>
                     <p>High level disinfectants are also used for processing instruments and other items.</p>
                     <p>Do not soak or store cheatle forceps, scissors, scalpel blades and suture needles in a disinfectant solution for a very long time.</p>
                     <p>Should you need to sterilise them using high level disinfectant solution, soak them only for a specified time, remove, rinse and store dry. What you should also note is that micro-organisms can live and multiply in disinfectant solutions which can in turn contaminate the instruments and other items, leading to infections. This topic will be covered in more detail later.</p>

                <h2>üìö Low Level Disinfectants</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Low level disinfectants kill most bacteria and some viruses and fungi but do not kill tuberculosis causing micro-organisms and bacterial endospores. They are used for cleaning surfaces such as floors and countertops. They should not be used for processing instruments and other items.</p>
