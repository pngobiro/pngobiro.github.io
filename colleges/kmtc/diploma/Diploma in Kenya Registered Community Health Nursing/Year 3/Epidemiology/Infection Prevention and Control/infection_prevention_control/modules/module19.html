                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Steps of cleaning:</p>
                   <ul>
                        <li>Wear utility gloves, goggles, a mask and protective eyewear when cleaning instruments and other items.</li>
                         <li>Using a soft brush, detergent and water and scrub instrument and other items vigorously to completely remove all blood, other body fluids, tissue and other foreign matter.</li>
                         <li>Hold instruments and other items under the surface of the water while scrubbing and cleaning to avoid splashing.</li>
                         <li>Disassemble instruments and other items with multiple parts, and be sure to brush in the grooves, teeth and joints of instruments and other items, where organic material can collect and stick.</li>
                         <li>Rinse instruments and other items thoroughly with clean running water to remove all detergents.</li>
                          <li>Allow instruments and other items to air dry, or dry with a clean towel. Instruments and other items should be dry before chemical high level disinfection to avoid diluting the chemicals, which may decrease their effectiveness. Instruments and other items to be high level disinfected by boiling or steaming do not need to be dried first</li>
                    </ul>
                      <p><b>Thorough rinsing after cleaning is important, particularly with chemical sterilisation or high level disinfection (HLD), because detergents can reduce the effectiveness of these chemicals.</b> It is important to dry instruments and other items after cleaning them. The water from instruments and other items dilutes the chemicals used for chemical sterilisation or HLD, making that process ineffective. If instruments and other items will be high level disinfected by boiling or steaming, drying is not necessary.</p>

                <h2>üìö Use of Detergents</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                   <p>Detergents are important for effective cleaning. Water alone does not remove proteins, oils or grease. When the detergent is dissolved in water it breaks and suspends oil and grease, making them easy to remove by cleaning.</p>
                     <p>Do not use hand soap for cleaning instruments and other items, because fatty acids contained in the soap will react with the minerals of hard water, leaving a residue or scum that is difficult to remove.</p>
                     <p>Avoid using steel wool or abrasive cleaners such as Vim or cement as they scratch or pit metal or stainless steel, which results in grooves that can collect micro-organisms. This also increases the potential for corrosion of the instruments.</p>
