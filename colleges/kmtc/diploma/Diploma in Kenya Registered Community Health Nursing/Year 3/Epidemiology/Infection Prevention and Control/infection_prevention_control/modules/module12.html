Can also be used for disinfection of surfaces. Leaves a residue, so instruments and other items must be rinsed thoroughly with boiled water after HLD. A new solution should be prepared daily (or sooner, if it becomes heavily contaminated) since potency is lost over time and after exposure to light.</td>
