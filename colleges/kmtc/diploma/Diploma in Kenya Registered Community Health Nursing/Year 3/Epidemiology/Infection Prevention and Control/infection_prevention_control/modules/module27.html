                     <p><b>1. Sorting</b></p>
                     <p>Sorting the waste at the point at which it is generated can greatly reduce the amount that needs special handling, thus reducing risks. Ensure that separate containers are used for disposing of general and medical waste. Use coloured plastic containers/bags, painted drums or labels that can be easily read to help distinguish between general and medical containers. For example, use red containers/plastic bags for medical waste. Process is known as <b>Waste Segregation</b>.</p>
                     <p><b>2. Handling</b></p>
                    <p>Handle medical waste as little as possible before disposal. Empty waste containers in operating rooms, procedure rooms, toilets, latrines and sluice rooms when they become three quarters full (at least once daily). Do not collect medical waste from client care areas by emptying it into open carts or wheelbarrows. This may lead to contamination of the surroundings and scavenging of waste. This may also increase the risk of injury to staff, patients and visitors.</p>
                     <p>Always wear heavy utility gloves and shoes when handling medical waste. Always wash your hands after handling waste and after removing your gloves</p>
                    <p><b>3. Interim Storage</b></p>
                    <p>If it is necessary to store medical waste on site before disposal:</p>
                      <ul>
                           <li>Place waste in an area that is minimally accessible to staff, patients and visitors.</li>
                           <li>Make sure all containers have lids.</li>
                            <li>Cover the containers so that insects, rodents and other animals cannot get into them.</li>
                           <li>Plan for only short term storage (usually for several hours), but no more than one or two days.</li>
