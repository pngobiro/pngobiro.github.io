                <div class="content-block">
                   <p>In order to reduce the risk of transmitting infections between patients, you should always adhere to the following:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Every time you give an injection, use a new or correctly processed hypodermic needle and syringe.</li>
                       <li>Do not change the needle without changing the syringe between patients.</li>
                       <li>Reusing the same syringe to give injections to many clients is not a safe practice</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>While administering intravenous fluids you have the responsibility to avoid the transmission of infections.</p>
                     <p>You must therefore do the following:</p>
                      <ul>
                           <li>Unhook the needle or catheter from the IV line and dispose of it in a sharps disposal container</li>
                           <li>Throw away any remaining fluid</li>
                            <li>Do not use the same IV line and fluid bag/bottle with multiple clients</li>
                       </ul>

                <h2>üìö Use of Multi Dose Vials</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                   <p>Before you fill a syringe from a multiple dose vial:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Check the vial to be sure there are no leaks or cracks.</li>
                        <li>Check the solution to be sure it is not cloudy and that there is no particulate matter in the vial.</li>
                        <li>Wipe the top of the vial with a fresh cotton swab soaked with 60-70% alcohol.</li>
                        <li>Allow to dry.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To reduce the risk of transmitting infections between patients:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Always use a sterile needle and syringe every time medication is withdrawn from a multiple dose vial.</li>
                         <li>Reusing the same syringe to give injections to multiple patients, even if the needle is changed is not a safe practice.</li>
                        <li>Do not leave a needle inserted in the vial cap for purpose of withdrawing drugs from a multiple dose vial. This provides a direct route for micro-organisms to enter the vial.</li>
                    </ul>

                 <div class="content-block">
                     <p>You are now going to cover the processing of instruments in more detail. It is important to bear in mind that when you are involved in the processing of instruments and other items, you are at high risk of infection. You therefore need to take appropriate steps to reduce this risk.</p>
                     <p>You are at risk of exposure to blood or other body fluids when processing instruments and other items.</p>

                <h2>üìö Decontamination</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                   <p>Decontamination is the first step in processing instruments and other items for re-use. Decontamination kills viruses and many micro-organisms, making the instruments and other items safe to handle by the staff who clean them.</p>
                     <p>Decontamination also makes instruments and other items easier to clean by preventing blood, other body fluids and tissue from drying on them. Decontamination is done by soaking instruments and other items immediately after use, in a 0.5% chlorine solution for 10-15 minutes immediately after use (AVSC, 1999).</p>
                     <p>A container of this solution should be kept in every operating room and procedure room so that used items can be placed directly into the bucket.</p>
                     <p>Prepare a new chlorine solution at the beginning of each day or when the solution looks as though it needs to be changed, such as when it becomes heavily contaminated with blood or other body fluids or becomes cloudy.</p>
