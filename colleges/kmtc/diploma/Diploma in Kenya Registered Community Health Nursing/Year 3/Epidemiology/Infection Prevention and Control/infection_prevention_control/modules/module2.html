                   <p>Globally the most frequent infections are: surgical wounds infection, lower respiratory tract and urinary tract infections. The emergence of highly infectious diseases such as the Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers (VHF) also increases the risk of hospital acquired infection.</p>
                    <p>Health care facilities are ideal settings for the transmission of infections because the invasive procedures routinely performed on patients have the potential of introducing micro-organisms into the body.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The service providers in health care facilities are at high risk because they constantly perform procedures that expose them to infections. They can easily spread an infection they have contracted at the health facility to their families because of poor infection prevention practices.</p>
                    <p>The community is also at risk of infections if they come into contact with medical waste such as contaminated sharps, dressings, tissue and chemical waste that have been inappropriately disposed</p>
                     <p>Everyone who works at a health care facility is potentially at risk of infections.</p>

                    <p><b>INFECTION</b> is invasion and multiplication of microorganisms in a host, with an associated host response (e.g. fever, pain, edema, purulent drainage).</p>

                   <p>Micro-organisms are normally present on people's skin, respiratory, intestinal and genital tracts. These micro-organisms are called normal flora.</p>
