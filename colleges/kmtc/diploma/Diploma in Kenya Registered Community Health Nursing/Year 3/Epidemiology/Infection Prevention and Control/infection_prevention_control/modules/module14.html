                   <p>Destroy or prevent the growth of micro-organisms.‚Äù You will realise that it is very important to pay proper attention to the preparation of a patient before a procedure because most surgical site infections result from contamination during surgery. To reduce the risk of infections if you must shave the surgical/procedure site, use antimicrobial soap and water or shave dry. On the other hand, you could shave immediately before the operation which is highly recommended to reduce the risk if infection, in the operation room or procedure room</p>

                <h2>üìö Preparing the Skin</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Clean the site with soap and water. Wipe the skin in a circular motion, beginning in the centre of the site then moving outwards. Use sterile cotton balls or cotton wool sponges held on sponge forceps. You could use any of the following antiseptics as listed in the preferred order:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An iodophor (Betadine); then wait for two minutes and wipe off the excess with sterile dry cotton or gauze</li>
                         <li>4% Chlorhexidine (HIbiclens) wipe off excess with sterile, dry cotton or gauze</li>
                         <li>1-3 % iodine, followed by 60-90% alcohol (ethyl or isopropyl) then allow to air dry</li>
                         <li>Chlorhexidine with cetrimide (Savlon) wipe off the excess with sterile, dry cotton or gauze</li>
                     </ul>
                    <p>Preparing the vagina and cervix</p>
                    <p>Apply an appropriate antiseptic (iodophor) to the vagina and cervix before passing instruments into the uterus such as IUD insertion, uterine evacuation. Alcohol based antiseptics should not be used on the vagina, cervix or other mucous membranes because they are damaging to these tissues.</p>

                    <p>Think about how you can maintain a sterile field.</p>
                    <p>You can maintain a sterile field by placing sterile towels and/or surgical drapes around the surgical/procedures site. Other measures include:</p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Placing only sterile items within the sterile field</li>
                        <li>Opening, dispensing or transferring sterile items without contaminating them</li>
                         <li>Considering items located below the level of the draped client to be unsterile</li>
                         <li>Not allowing sterile personnel to reach across unsterile areas and touch unsterile items</li>
                        <li>Not allowing unsterile personnel to reach across the sterile field or to touch sterile items</li>
