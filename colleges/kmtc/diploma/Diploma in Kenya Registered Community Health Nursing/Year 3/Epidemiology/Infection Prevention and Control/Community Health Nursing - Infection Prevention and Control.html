                <p>(a) Describe the recent changes in the pattern of infectious diseases in Kenya. (4 marks)</p>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
                    <p>Over the past few decades, Kenya has experienced a drastic change in the pattern of infectious diseases. Some eradicated diseases are re-emerging (e.g., COVID-19), and new ones are being identified. There have been sporadic outbreaks of diseases like cholera, measles, plague, and yellow fever. New viruses like Hepatitis B and C have become common. Drug resistance and high HIV/AIDS prevalence further complicate the situation.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
                    <p>Nosocomial infections are hospital-acquired infections that patients contract during their stay in a healthcare facility. These infections can range from trivial to life-threatening conditions like septicemia.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
                    <p>Healthcare facilities are ideal settings for the transmission of infections because the invasive procedures routinely performed on patients can introduce micro-organisms into the body. Additionally, the presence of sick individuals and the use of shared equipment contribute to the risk.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
                    <p>The groups at risk of infection include service providers in healthcare facilities (due to constant exposure), their families (due to poor infection prevention practices), and the community (through contact with medical waste).</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
                    <p>Infection is the invasion and multiplication of microorganisms in a host, with an associated host response (e.g., fever, pain). Colonization, on the other hand, is when microorganisms are present in the host but do not invade or cause a response. Infection may require treatment, while colonization typically does not.</p>

                    <p>i. Alcohol (60-90% ethyl or isopropyl)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Antimicrobial Spectrum: Kills micro-organisms most rapidly. Effective against a broad range of micro-organisms.</li>
                        <li>Advantages: Most effective in reducing micro-organisms. Effectiveness is only moderately reduced by blood or other organic material.</li>
                        <li>Disadvantages: Has a drying effect on the skin. Cannot be used when the skin is dirty. Cannot be used on mucous membranes.</li>
                        <li>Comments: Wash the area before applying. Must dry skin completely to be effective. The 60-70% strength is most effective.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>ii. Chlorhexidine gluconate (Hibitane, Hibiclens, Hibiscrub)/Chlorhexidine gluconate with cetrimide (Savlon)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Antimicrobial Spectrum: Effective against a broad range of micro-organisms, remains effective for at least 6 hours after being applied, but has a minimal effect on tuberculosis and fungi.</li>
                        <li>Advantages: Has a good persistent effect. Effectiveness is not reduced by blood or other organic material.</li>
                        <li>Disadvantages: On rare occasions, products containing chlorhexidine have been reported to cause irritation, especially when used in the genital area. Effectiveness can be reduced by hard water, hand creams, and natural soaps.</li>
                        <li>Comments: Recommended antiseptic for surgical hand scrub and skin preparation. Preparations without cetrimide are preferable.</li>

                        <li>Advantages: Has a good, persistent effect with repeated use, which remains effective for at least six hours after being applied.</li>
                        <li>Disadvantages: Potentially toxic to the nervous system. Occasional use is not effective in reducing the number of micro-organisms on the hands. If use is discontinued after long-term use, a rebound increase of bacterial growth will occur.</li>
                        <li>Comments: Contraindicated for routine use on irritated or broken skin or mucous membranes. Not recommended for use in surgical hand scrub or skin preparation.</li>

                        <li>Disadvantages: Can cause irritation. Effectiveness is markedly reduced by blood or other organic material.</li>
                        <li>Comments: Too irritating for routine use in surgical hand scrub or for use on mucous membranes. When used for preparation, iodine must be allowed to dry and then removed from the skin with alcohol.</li>

                        <li>Disadvantages: Effectiveness is moderately reduced by blood or other organic material.</li>
                        <li>Comments: Recommended antiseptic for surgical hand scrub and client preparation. Best antiseptic for use in the genitalia area, vagina, and cervix. Effective 1-2 minutes after application. Most preparations should be used at full strength.</li>
                    </ul>
                      <p>vi. Para-Chloro-Meta-Xylenol (PCMX, Chloroxylenol, e.g. Dettol)</p>

                        <li>Antimicrobial Spectrum: Fairly effective against most micro-organisms.</li>
                        <li>Advantages: Has a persistent effect over several hours. Activity is only minimally reduced by blood or other organic material.</li>
                        <li>Disadvantages: Less effective than chlorhexidine and iodophors.</li>
                        <li>Comments: Not recommended for routine use. PCMX is available in both antiseptic and disinfectant preparations. Preparations containing alcohol should not be used on mucous membranes. Disinfectant preparations containing PCMX should not be used as antiseptics.</li>

                    <p>Cleaning involves scrubbing with a brush, detergent, and water to remove blood, other body fluids, organic material, tissue, and dirt. Instruments should be held under the surface of the water while scrubbing. Disassemble instruments with multiple parts and brush in the grooves, teeth, and joints. Rinse thoroughly with clean running water.</p>

                    <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
                    <p>Cleaning is crucial because if it has not been done, sterilization and high-level disinfection (HLD) may not be effective. Micro-organisms trapped in organic material may be protected and survive, and organic material can make chemicals used in sterilization and HLD less effective.</p>

                    <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
                    <p>The four aspects of medical waste management are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sorting: Separating waste at the point of generation.</li>

                        <li>Interim storage: Storing waste safely before final disposal.</li>
                        <li>Disposal: Using appropriate methods to eliminate waste.</li>

                <p>(a) Explain the process of "waste segregation" and its importance. (4 marks)</p>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
                    <p>Waste segregation is the process of sorting waste at the point at which it is generated. It is important because it can greatly reduce the amount that needs special handling, thus reducing risks. Ensure that separate containers are used for disposing of general and medical waste. Use coloured plastic containers/bags, painted drums or labels that can be easily read to help distinguish between general and medical containers. For example, use red containers/plastic bags for medical waste.</p>
