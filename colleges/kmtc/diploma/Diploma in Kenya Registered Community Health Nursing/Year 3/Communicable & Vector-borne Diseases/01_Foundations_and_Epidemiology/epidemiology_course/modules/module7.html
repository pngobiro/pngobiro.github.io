                    <p>When the event under study is death rather than the occurrence of disease, we usually use the term mortality (rate) rather than cumulative incidence.</p>

                            <li>Each rate is a measure of the relative frequency of deaths that occurred in a given population over a specific period</li>

                   <ul><li>Defined as the number of deaths assigned to puerperal causes (i.e. related to childbearing) in a calendar year divided by the number of live births in that year, with the quotient multiplied by 100,000</li></ul>

                    <ul><li>Defined as the number of deaths of persons of age 0-1 in a calendar year divided by the number of live births in that year, with the quotient multiplied by 1000</li></ul>

                    <ul><li>Defined as the number of deaths of neonates (i.e., infants less than 28 days of age) that occurred in a calendar year divided by the number of live births in that year, with the quotient multiplied by 1000</li></ul>
                     <p><strong>FETAL DEATH RATIO</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fetal death is defined as the delivery of a fetus that shows no evidence of life (no heart action, breathing, or movement of voluntary muscles) if the 20th week of gestation has been completed or if the period of gestation was unstated</li>
                        <li>Fetal death ration is defined as the number of fetal deaths in a calendar year divided by the number of live births in that year, with the quotient multiplied by 1000.</li>
                        <li>Note that this ratio only applies to fetal deaths that occur in the second half of pregnancy. No reporting is required for early miscarriage</li>

                    <p><strong>PERINATAL MORTALITY PROPORTION</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Defined as the number of fetal plus neonatal deaths divided by the number of live births plus fetal deaths, with the quotient multiplied by 1000</li>
