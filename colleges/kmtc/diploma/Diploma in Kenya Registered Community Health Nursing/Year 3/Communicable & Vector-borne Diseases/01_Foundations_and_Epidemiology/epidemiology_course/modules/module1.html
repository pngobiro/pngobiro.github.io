                <h2>Definition and Origin of Epidemiology</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The word epidemiology comes from the Greek words <em>epi</em>, meaning ‚Äúon or upon,‚Äù <em>demos</em>, meaning ‚Äúpeople,‚Äù and <em>logos</em>, meaning ‚Äúthe study of.‚Äù  A commonly accepted definition is: Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to the prevention and control of health problems. (Last, 1995)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Epi:</strong> 'on, upon, at, by, near, over, on top of, against, among'</li>
                        <li><strong>demos:</strong> 'people/populations'</li>
                        <li><strong>logos/ology:</strong> 'study of'</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Other Definitions:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>The study of the patterns, causes, and control of disease in groups of people.</li>
                        <li>Study of how disease is distributed in populations and the factors that influence this distribution.</li>
                     </ul>
                      <p><strong>Why Study Epidemiology?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Epidemiology relies on scientific methods to apply a systematic approach to the collection, analysis and interpretation of data.</li>
                        <li>The main basis of epidemiology is using an observation and comparison group to determine if whether what is observed (distribution and determinants) differs from what is expected.</li>
                        <li>Epidemiology also depends on methods from other fields such as economics, social and behavioural sciences, biology, biostatistics, informatics etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why Distribution?</strong></p>
                   <p>In distribution we consider:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> This includes not only the number of health-related states or events but also their relation to the whole population.</li>
                     <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> This includes disease occurrence in time, place or person:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Time:</strong> daily, weekly, monthly etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Place:</strong> geography (rural, urban), work, school</li>
                            <li><strong>Person:</strong> personal characteristics: age, sex, socio-economic status, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Why determinants?</strong></p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>The underlying assumption of Epidemiology is that human disease does not occur in a vacuum.</li>
                        <li>Human disease occurs when a host (you and I), the agent (e.g. bacteria etc) and the environment (e.g. polluted air) interact to cause disease.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why health related states or events?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Health related events may be defined as anything that may threaten or affect the general health of a population.</li>
                        <li>Originally, epidemiology focused on outbreaks of communicable diseases however, with time, epidemiology now also focuses on non-communicable diseases, injuries, maternal and child health, environmental and occupational health and recently genetics and molecular health studies</li>
                    </ul>
                     <p><strong>Why specified Populations?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Epidemiology focuses on the health of communities or populations. This is unlike healthcare professionals who focus on the health of an individual. Epidemiology is about groups of people not individuals. It answers population questions:
                            <ul>
                                <li> aetiology of disease.</li>
                                <li> prevention of disease.</li>
                                <li> Extent/distribution of disease (allocation of effort & resources in health facilities and communities).</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>

                <div class="content-block">
                   <p><strong>Types of Epidemiology</strong></p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Descriptive epidemiology:</strong> This is characterization of the distribution of health-related states or events is one broad aspect of epidemiology called descriptive epidemiology. Descriptive epidemiology provides the What, Who, When, and Where of health-related events.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytic epidemiology:</strong> Epidemiology is also used to search for causes and other factors that influence the occurrence of health-related events. Analytic epidemiology attempts to provide the Why and How of such events by comparing groups with different rates of disease occurrence and with differences in demographic characteristics, genetic or immunologic make-up, behaviors, environmental exposures, and other so-called potential risk factors. Under ideal circumstances, epidemiologic findings provide sufficient evidence to direct swift and effective public health control and prevention measures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Applied Epidemiology:</strong> The term applied epidemiology is used to describe the application or practice of epidemiology to address public health issues.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Examples of applied epidemiology include the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the monitoring of reports of communicable diseases in the community</li>
                        <li>the study of whether a particular dietary component influences your risk of developing cancer</li>
                        <li>evaluation of the effectiveness and impact of a cholesterol awareness program</li>
                        <li>analysis of historical trends and current data to project future public health resource needs</li>
                    </ul>

                <p><strong>Historical Evolution of Epidemiology</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Circa 400 B.C.:</strong> Hippocrates attempts to explain there is a rational cause for disease rather than supernatural forces. He suggests that the environment and host factors may influence disease occurrence.</li>
                    <li><strong>1662:</strong> John Graunt, a Londoner haberdasher and councilman published his analysis of mortality data in 1662. His data noted difference in mortality patterns in males, females and infants.</li>
                    <li><strong>1854:</strong> An anesthesiologist named John Snow was conducting a series of investigations in London that later earned him the title ‚Äúthe father of field epidemiology.‚Äù Twenty years before the development of the microscope, Snow conducted studies of cholera outbreaks both to discover the cause of disease and to prevent its recurrence. Because his work classically illustrates the sequence from descriptive epidemiology to hypothesis generation to hypothesis testing (analytic epidemiology) to application, we will consider two of his efforts in detail. Snow conducted his classic study in 1854 when an epidemic of cholera developed in the Golden Square of London. He began his investigation by determining where in this area persons with cholera lived and worked. He then used this information to map the distribution of cases on what epidemiologists call a spot map.</li>
                    <li><strong>1890:</strong> William Farr, built on Graunt‚Äôs work by systematically analyzing Britain's mortality statistics. He developed the basic practices used in collecting, analysing and reporting vital statistics.</li>
                    <li><strong>19th and 20th Century:</strong> Epidemiological methods have been used to investigate infectious diseases, chronic diseases (Doll & Hill; Framingham), injuries/violence, molecular and genetic epidemiology.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With the advent of bioterrorism, epidemiologists have to consider not only natural transmission but also biological warfare in epidemiology of infectious diseases.</p>
