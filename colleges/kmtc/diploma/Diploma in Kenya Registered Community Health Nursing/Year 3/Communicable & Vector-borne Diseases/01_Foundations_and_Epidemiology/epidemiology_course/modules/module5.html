                <p>level of disease prevention,</p>
                <p>Scope of, epidemiology,</p>
                 <p>Epidemiology and the information generated by epidemiologic methods have many uses. These uses are categorized and described below.</p>
                 <ol>
                    <li><strong>Population or community health assessment.</strong> To set policy and plan programs, public health officials must assess the health of the population or community they serve and must determine whether health services are available, accessible, effective, and efficient. To do this, they must find answers to many questions: What are the actual and potential</li>
                    <li><strong>Individual decisions.</strong> People may not realize that they use epidemiologic information in their daily decisions. When they decide to stop smoking, take the stairs instead of the elevator, or choose one method of contraception instead of another, they may be influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by epidemiologists' assessment of risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Completing the clinical picture.</strong> When studying a disease outbreak, epidemiologists depend on clinical physicians and laboratory scientists for the proper diagnosis of individual patients. But epidemiologists also contribute to physicians' understanding of the clinical picture and natural history of disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Search for causes.</strong> Much of epidemiologic research is devoted to a search for causes, factors which influence one's risk of disease. Sometimes this is an academic pursuit, but more often the goal is to identify a cause so that appropriate public health action might be taken. It has been said that epidemiology can never prove a causal relationship between an exposure and a disease. Nevertheless, epidemiology often provides enough information to support effective action. Identify the risk factors/cause of a disease</li>
                    <li>Determine the extent to which the disease is found in the community</li>
                    <li>Determine the natural history and <strong>prognosis</strong> of a disease</li>
                    <li>Evaluate new and existing preventive and therapeutic measures and modes of health care delivery</li>
                    <li>Provide foundation for developing public policy relating to health issues</li>
                 </ol>

                <p><strong>VITAL STATISTICS RATIOS,PROPORTIONS and RATES,</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Ratio</strong> The quotient of 2 numbers</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Numerator NOT necessarily INCLUDED in the denominator</li>
                    <li>Allows comparing quantities of different nature Ratio</li>
                </ul>
                 <p><strong>Examples of Ratios</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li># beds per doctor ‚Äì 850 beds/10 doctors ‚Äì R = 85 beds for 1 doctor</li>
                    <li># participants per facilitator</li>
                    <li># inhabitants per latrine</li>
                    <li>Sex ratio: Male / Female Female / Male</li>
                    <li>Odds ratio</li>
                    <li>Rate ratio</li>
                    <li>Prevalence ratio</li>
                </ul>

                 <p><strong>Proportion:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is a quotient of 2 numbers</li>
                    <li>Numerator NECESSARILY INCLUDED in the denominator</li>
                    <li>Quantities have to be of the same nature</li>
                    <li>Proportion always ranges between 0 and 1</li>
                    <li>Percentage = proportion x 100</li>
                </ul>
                 <p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
                <p>Population 3500 women</p>
                 <p>6500 men</p>
                <p>Proportion of men = 6500 / (3500 + 6500) = 0.65 or 65 %</p>
                <p>Male to female ratio= 6500/3500 = 1.86</p>
                <p>Female to male ratio = 3500/6500 = 0.54</p>
                <p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
                <p>AIDS cases: 4000 male cases</p>
                <p>2000 female cases</p>
                <p>Q: What is the proportion of male cases among all cases?</p>
                <p>Female cases among all cases?</p>

                <p><strong>Rate</strong> is a quotient of 2 numbers</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Speed of occurrence of an event over time</li>
                    <li><strong>Numerator -</strong> number/EVENTS observed for a given time</li>
                    <li><strong>Denominator -</strong> population in which the events occur (population at risk)</li>
                    <li>includes time</li>
                    <li>Rate is something that may change over time</li>
                    <li>Something that is observed during some time</li>
                    <li>Measures the speed of occurrence of an event</li>
                    <li>Measures the probability to become sick by unit of time</li>
                    <li>Measures the risk of disease</li>
                    <li>However rate is frequently used instead of ratio or proportion !!</li>
                    <li>Time is included in the denominator !!</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example of calculating a rate</strong></p>
               <ul>
                <li>Mortality rate of tetanus in X country in 1995
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tetanus deaths: 17</li>
                        <li>Population in 1995: 58 million</li>
                        <li>Mortality rate =0.029/100,000/year</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                 <li>Rate may be expressed in any power of 10 ‚Äì 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000</li>
