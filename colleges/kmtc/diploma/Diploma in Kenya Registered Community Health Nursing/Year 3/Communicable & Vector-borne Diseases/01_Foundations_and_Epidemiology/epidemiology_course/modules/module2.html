                <div class="content-block">
                  <p><strong>Terms used in epidemiology,</strong></p>
                    <p>Epidemiology is the study of factors affecting the health and illness of populations, and serves as the foundation and logic of interventions made in the interest of public health and preventive medicine. It is considered a cornerstone methodology of public health research, and is highly regarded in evidence-based medicine for identifying risk factors for disease and determining optimal treatment approaches to clinical practice.</p>
                    <p><strong>Health</strong> is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.</p>
                    <p><strong>Illness</strong> (sometimes referred to as ill-health or ail) can be defined as a state of poor health.</p>
                    <p><strong>Logic</strong> is the study of the principles of valid inference and demonstration. The word derives from Greek ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫ŒÆ(logike), fem. of ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫œåœÇ(logikos), "possessed of reason, intellectual, dialectical, argumentative", from ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇlogos, "word, thought, idea, argument, account, reason, or principle".</p>
                   <p><strong>Public health</strong> is the study and practice of managing threats to the health of a community. The field pays special attention to the social context of disease and health, and focuses on improving health through society-wide measures like vaccinations, the fluoridation of drinking water, or through policies like seatbelt and non-smoking laws. The public-health approach can be applied to a population of just a handful of people or to the whole human population. Public health is typically divided into epidemiology, biostatistics and health services. Environmental, social, behavioral, and health are also important subfields.</p>
                    <p>Generally speaking, <strong>preventive medicine</strong> is the part of medicine engaged with preventing disease rather than curing it. It can be contrasted not only with curative medicine, but also with public health methods (which work at the level of population health rather than individual health). Professionals involved in the public health aspect of this practice may be involved in entomology, pest control, and public health inspections. Public health inspections can include recreational waters, pools, beaches, food preparation and serving, and industrial hygiene inspections and surveys.</p>
                     <p><strong>Evidence-based medicine (EBM)</strong> aims to apply evidence gained from the scientific method to certain parts of medical practice. It seeks to assess the quality of evidence relevant to the risks and benefits of treatments (including lack of treatment</p>
