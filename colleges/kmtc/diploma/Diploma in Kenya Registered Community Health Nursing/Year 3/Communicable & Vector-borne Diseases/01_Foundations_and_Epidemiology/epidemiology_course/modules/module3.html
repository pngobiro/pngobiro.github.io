<h2>Natural History of Disease</h2>
<div class="content-block">
    <p><strong>Natural History and Spectrum of Disease</strong> Natural history of disease refers to the progress of a disease process in an individual over time, in the absence of intervention. The process begins with exposure to or accumulation of factors capable of causing disease. Without medical intervention, the process ends with recovery, disability, or death.</p>
    <p>Most diseases have a characteristic natural history (which is poorly understood for many diseases), although the time frame and specific manifestations of disease may vary from individual to individual. With a particular individual, the usual course of a disease may be halted at any point in the progression by preventive and therapeutic measures, host factors, and other influences.</p>
    <p><strong>Stages of Natural history of disease</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Exposure</li>
        <li>Pathologic changes</li>
        <li>Onset of symptoms</li>
        <li>Usual time of diagnosis</li>
        <li>Stage of susceptibility</li>
        <li>Stage of subclinical disease</li>
        <li>Stage of clinical disease</li>
        <li>Stage of recovery, disability or death</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The natural history begins with the appropriate exposure to or accumulation of factors sufficient to begin the disease process in a susceptible host. For infectious disease, the exposure usually is a microorganism. For cancers, the critical factors may require both cancer initiators, such as asbestos fibers or components in tobacco smoke (for lung cancer), and cancer promoters, such as estrogens (for endometrial cancer). Usually, a period of subclinical or in apparent pathologic changes follows exposure, ending with the onset of symptoms. For infectious diseases, this period is usually called the <strong>incubation period</strong>; for chronic diseases, this period is usually called the <strong>latency period</strong>. This period may be as brief as seconds for hypersensitivity and toxic reactions to as long as decades for certain chronic diseases. Even for a single disease, the characteristic incubation period has a range. For example, for hepatitis A, this range is about 2 to 6 weeks.</p>
     <p>Although disease is in apparent during the incubation period, some pathologic changes may be detectable with laboratory, radiographic, or other screening methods. Most screening programs attempt to identify the disease process during this phase of its natural history, since early intervention may be more effective than treatment at a later stage of disease progression. The onset of symptoms marks the transition from subclinical to clinical disease. Most diagnoses are made during the stage of clinical disease. In some people, however, the disease process may</p>
    <p>never progress to clinically apparent illness. In others, the disease process may result in a wide spectrum of clinical illness, ranging from mild to severe or fatal. Three terms are used to describe an infectious disease according to the various outcomes that may occur after exposure to its causative agent.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Infectivity</strong> refers to the proportion of exposed persons who become infected.</li>
        <li><strong>Pathogenicity</strong> refers to the proportion of infected persons who develop clinical disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Virulence</strong> refers to the proportion of persons with clinical disease who become severely ill or die.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, hepatitis A virus in children has low pathogenicity and low virulence, since many infected children remain asymptomatic and few develop severe illness. In persons with good nutrition and health, measles virus has high pathogenicity but low virulence, since almost all infected persons develop the characteristic rash illness but few develop the life-threatening presentations of measles, pneumonia, or encephalitis. In persons with poorer nutrition and health, measles is a more virulent disease, with mortality as high as 5-10%. Finally, rabies virus is both highly pathogenic and virulent, since virtually 100% of all infected persons (who do not receive treatment) progress to clinical disease and death.</p>
   <p>The natural history and spectrum of disease presents challenges to the clinician and to the public health worker. Because of the clinical spectrum, cases of illness diagnosed by clinicians in the community often represent only the ‚Äútip of the iceberg." Many additional cases may be too early to diagnose or may remain asymptomatic. For the public health worker, the challenge is that persons with in apparent or undiagnosed infections may nonetheless be able to transmit them to others. Such persons who are infectious but have subclinical disease are called <strong>carriers</strong>. Frequently, carriers are persons with incubating disease or in apparent infection. Persons with measles, hepatitis A, and several other diseases become infectious a few days before the onset of symptoms. On the other hand, carriers may also be persons who appear to have recovered from their clinical illness, such as chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus.</p>
