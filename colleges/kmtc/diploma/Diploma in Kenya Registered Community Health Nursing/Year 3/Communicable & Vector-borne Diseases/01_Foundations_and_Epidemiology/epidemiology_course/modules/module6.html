                    <li>Mortality rate =0.029/100,000/year</li>
                    <li>Rate may be expressed in any power of 10 ‚Äì 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000</li>

                 <p><strong>Relationship of Incidence to Prevalence</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prevalence depends on both on incidence rate and duration of disease</li>
                    <li>Because prevalence affected by factors such as migration and duration, incidence is preferred for studying etiology.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Special types of Incidence</strong></p>
                <p>Morbidity rate=# cases / Population at risk</p>
                <p>Mortality rate=# deaths / Population at risk</p>
                <p>Case Fatality rate=# deaths from a disease / Total cases of that disease</p>
                <p>Attack rate=# cases during |epidemic" / Population at risk</p>
                <p><strong>Attack Rate</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An attack rate is an incidence rate calculated for a specific disease for a limited period of time during an epidemic</li>
                    <li>Usually expressed for the entire epidemic period, from the first to the last case</li>
                    <li>Attack Rate=Number of new cases of a specified disease reported during an epidemic period of time
                        <ul>
                            <li>Population at risk during the same time interval</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Secondary Attack Rate =Number of new cases of a specified disease among contacts of known cases/ Size of contact population at risk</p>
                <p><strong>Example: Attack rate</strong></p>
                <p>Seven cases of hepatitis A occurred among 70 children attending a childcare center. Each infected child came from a different family. The total number of persons in the 7 affected families was 32. One incubation period later, 5 family members of the 7 infected children also developed hepatitis</p>
                <p>A. Calculate the attack rate in the child care center</p>
                <p>B. Calculate the secondary attack rate</p>
                <p>PREVALENCE PROPORTION</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Defined as the number of existing cases of a given disease at a given time divided by the population at that time, with the quotient multiplied by 1000, 100,000, or 1,000,000</li>
