                <p><strong>Chain of Infection</strong></p>
                <p>The traditional model (epi triad) illustrates that infectious diseases result from the interaction of agent, host, and environment. More specifically, transmission occurs when the agent leaves its reservoir or host through a portal of exit, and is conveyed by some mode of transmission, and enters through an appropriate portal of entry to infect a susceptible host. This is sometimes called the chain of infection consisting of the following;</p>

            <h2>Chain of Infection</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                <p><strong>Reservoir:</strong></p>
                <p>The reservoir of an agent is the habitat in which an infectious agent normally lives, grows, and multiplies. Reservoirs include humans, animals, and the environment. The reservoir may or may not be the source from which an agent is transferred to a host. For example, the reservoir of Clostridium botulinum is soil, but the source of most botulism infections is improperly canned food containing C. botulinum spores.</p>

                <p><strong>Human reservoirs.</strong> Many of the common infectious diseases have human reservoirs. Diseases which are transmitted from person to person without intermediaries include the sexually transmitted diseases, measles, mumps, streptococcal infection, most respiratory pathogens, and many others. Smallpox was eradicated after the last human case was identified and isolated because humans were the only reservoir for the smallpox virus. Two types of human reservoir exist:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>persons with symptomatic illness</li>
                <li>carriers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A carrier is a person without apparent disease who is nonetheless capable of transmitting the agent to others. Carriers may be asymptomatic carriers, who never show symptoms during the time they are infected, or may be incubatory or convalescent carriers, who are capable of transmission before or after they are clinically ill. A chronic carrier is one who continues to harbor an agent (such as hepatitis B virus or Salmonella typhi‚Äîthe agent of typhoid fever) for an extended time (months or years) following the initial infection. Carriers commonly transmit disease because they do not recognize they are infected and consequently take no special precautions to prevent transmission.</p>

                <p><strong>Symptomatic persons,</strong> on the other hand, are usually less likely to transmit infection widely because their symptoms increase their likelihood of being diagnosed and treated, thereby reducing their opportunity for contact with others.</p>
                <p><strong>Animal reservoirs.</strong> Infectious diseases that are transmissible under normal conditions from animals to humans are called zoonoses. In general, these diseases are transmitted from animal to animal, with humans as incidental hosts. Such diseases include brucellosis (cows and pigs), anthrax (sheep), plague (rodents), trichinosis (swine), and rabies (bats, raccoons, dogs, and other mammals). Another group of diseases with animal reservoirs are those caused by viruses transmitted by insects and caused by parasites that have complex life cycles, with different reservoirs at different stages of development. Such diseases include St. Louis encephalitis and malaria (both requiring mosquitos) and schistosomiasis (requiring fresh water snails).</p>
                 <p><strong>Environmental reservoirs.</strong> Plants, soil, and water in the environment are also reservoirs for some infectious agents. Many fungal agents, such as those causing histoplasmosis, live and multiply in the soil.</p>

                <p><strong>Portal of exit</strong></p>
                <p>Portal of exit is the path by which an agent leaves the source host. The portal of exit usually corresponds to the site at which the agent is localized eg tubercle bacilli and influenza viruses exit the respiratory tract, schistosomes through urine, cholera vibrios in feces, Some blood borne agents can exit by crossing the placenta (rubella, syphilis, toxoplasmosis), while others exit by way of the skin (percutaneously) through cuts or needles (hepatitis B) or blood-sucking arthropods (malaria).</p>
                <p><strong>Modes of transmission</strong></p>
                <p>After an agent exits its natural reservoir, it may be transmitted to a susceptible host in numerous ways. These modes of transmission are classified as Direct and indirect as listed above.</p>
                 <p>In <strong>direct transmission,</strong> there is essentially immediate transfer of the agent from a reservoir to a susceptible host by direct contact or droplet spread. Direct contact occurs through kissing, skin-to-skin contact, and sexual intercourse. Direct contact refers also to contact with soil or vegetation harboring infectious organisms. Thus gonorrhoea is spread from person-to-person by direct contact. Hookworm is spread by direct contact with contaminated soil. Droplet spread refers to spray with relatively large, short-range aerosols produced by sneezing, coughing, or even talking. Droplet spread is classified as direct because transmission is by direct spray over a few feet, before the droplets fall to the ground.</p>

                <p>In <strong>indirect transmission,</strong> an agent is carried from a reservoir to a susceptible host by suspended air particles or by animate (vector) or inanimate (vehicle) intermediaries. Most vectors are arthropods such as mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks. These may carry the agent through purely mechanical means. For example, flies carry Shigella on appendages; fleas carry Yersinia pestis (agent that causes plague) in the gut and deposit the agent on the skin of a new host. In mechanical transmission, the agent does not multiply or undergo physiologic changes in the vector. This is in contrast to instances in which an agent undergoes part of its life cycle inside a vector before being transmitted to a new host. When the agent undergoes changes within the vector, the vector is serving as both an intermediate host and a mode of transmission. This type of indirect transmission is a biologic transmission. Guinea worm disease and many other vectorborne diseases have complex life cycles which require an intermediate host.</p>
                 <p>Vehicles that may indirectly transmit an agent include food, water, biologic products (blood), and fomites (inanimate objects such as handkerchiefs, bedding, or surgical scalpels). As with vectors, vehicles may passively carry an agent‚Äîas food or water may carry hepatitis A virus</p>
                 <p><strong>Airborne transmission</strong> is by particles that are suspended in air. There are two types of these particles: dust and droplet nuclei. Airborne dust includes infectious particles blown from the soil by the wind as well as material that has settled on surfaces and become resuspended by air currents. Droplet nuclei are the residue of dried droplets. The nuclei are less than 5 Œº (microns) in size and may remain suspended in the air for long periods, may be blown over great distances, and are easily inhaled into the lungs and exhaled. This makes them an important means of transmission for some diseases. Tuberculosis, for example, is believed to be transmitted more often indirectly, through droplet nuclei, than directly, through droplet spread. Legionnaires' disease and histoplasmosis are also spread through airborne transmission.</p>

                <p><strong>Portal of entry</strong></p>
                <p>An agent enters a susceptible host through a portal of entry. The portal of entry must provide access to tissues in which the agent can multiply or a toxin can act. Often, organisms use the same portal to enter a new host that they use to exit the source host. For example, influenza virus must exit the respiratory tract of the source host and enter the respiratory tract of the new host.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                <p>Other portals of entry include the skin (hookworm), mucous membranes (syphilis, trachoma), and blood (hepatitis B).</p>
                <p><strong>Host</strong></p>
                <p>The final link in the chain of infection is a susceptible host. Susceptibility of a host depends on genetic factors, specified acquired immunity, and other general factors which alter an individual's ability to resist infection or to limit pathogenicity. An individual's genetic makeup may either increase or decrease susceptibility.</p>
                 <p>General factors which defend against infection include the skin, mucous membranes, gastric acidity, cilia in the respiratory tract, the cough reflex, and nonspecific immune response. General factors that may increase susceptibility are malnutrition, alcoholism, and disease or therapy which impairs the nonspecific immune response.</p>
                <p>Specific acquired immunity refers to protective antibodies that are directed against a specific agent. Individuals gain protective antibodies in two ways:</p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>They develop antibodies in response to infection, vaccine, or toxoid; immunity developed in these ways is called active immunity.</li>
                    <li>They acquire their mothers' antibodies before birth through the placenta or they receive injections of antitoxins or immune globulin; immunity that is acquired in these ways is called passive immunity.</li>
                   </ol>
                <p>Note that the chain of infection may be interrupted when an agent does not find a susceptible host. This may occur if a high proportion of individuals in a population is resistant to an agent. These persons limit spread to the relatively few who are susceptible by reducing the probability of contact between infected and susceptible persons. This concept is called herd immunity. The degree of herd immunity necessary to prevent or abort an outbreak varies by disease. In theory, herd immunity means that not everyone in a community needs to be resistant (immune) to prevent disease spread and occurrence of an outbreak. In practice, herd immunity has not prevented outbreaks of measles and rubella in populations with immunity levels as high as 85 to 90%. One problem is that, in highly immunized populations, the relatively few susceptible persons are often clustered in population subgroups, usually defined by socioeconomic or cultural factors. If the agent is introduced into one of these subgroups, an outbreak may occur.</p>
                <p><strong>Implications for public health.</strong></p>
                <p>By knowing how an agent exits and enters a host, and what its modes of transmission are, we can determine appropriate control measures.</p>
                 <p>In general, we should direct control measures against the link in the infection chain that is most susceptible to interference, unless practical issues dictate otherwise. For some diseases, the most</p>
                 <p>appropriate intervention may be directed at controlling or eliminating the agent at its source. In the hospital setting, patients may be treated and/or isolated, with appropriate ‚Äúenteric precautions," "respiratory precautions,‚Äù ‚Äúuniversal precautions,‚Äù and the like for different exit pathways. In the community, soil may be decontaminated or covered to prevent escape of the agent.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, we direct interventions at the mode of transmission. For direct transmission, we may provide treatment to the source host or educate the source host to avoid the specific type of contact associated with transmission. In the hospital setting, since most infections are transmitted by direct contact, hand washing is the single most important way to prevent diseases from spreading. For vehicle-borne transmission, we may decontaminate or eliminate the vehicle. For fecal-oral transmission, we may also try to reduce the risk of contamination in the future by rearranging the environment and educating the persons involved in better personal hygiene. For airborne transmission, we may modify ventilation or air pressure, and filter or treat the air. For vector-borne transmission, we usually attempt to control (i.e., reduce or eradicate) the vector population.</p>
                <p>Finally, we may apply measures that protect portals of entry of a susceptible potential host or reduce the susceptibility of the potential host. For example, a dentist's mask and gloves are intended to protect the dentist from a patient's blood, secretions, and droplets, as well to protect the patient from the dentist. Prophylactic antibiotics and vaccination are strategies to improve a potential host's defences.</p>
                 <p><strong>Epidemic Disease Occurrence</strong></p>
                 <p><strong>Level of disease</strong></p>
                <p>The amount of a particular disease that is usually present in a community is the baseline level of the disease. This level is not necessarily the preferred level, which should in fact be zero; rather it is the observed level. Theoretically, if no intervention occurred and if the level is low enough not to deplete the pool of susceptible persons, the disease occurrence should continue at the baseline level indefinitely. Thus, the baseline level is often considered the expected level of the disease.</p>
                <p>Different diseases, in different communities, show different patterns of expected occurrence:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>a persistent level of occurrence with a low to moderate disease level is referred to as an endemic level;</li>
                    <li>a persistently high level of occurrence is called a hyperendemic level;</li>
                    <li>an irregular pattern of occurrence, with occasional cases occurring at irregular intervals is called sporadic.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>The Epidemiologic Approach (Case Definition, Time, Place and Person)</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                 <p>Occasionally, the level of disease rises above the expected level. When the occurrence of a disease within an area is clearly in excess of the expected level for a given time period, it is called an <strong>epidemic.</strong> Public health officials often use the term <strong>outbreak,</strong> which means the same thing, because it is less provocative to the public. When an epidemic spreads over several countries or continents, affecting a large number of people, it is called a <strong>pandemic.</strong> Epidemics occur when an agent and susceptible hosts are present in adequate numbers, and the agent can effectively be conveyed from a source to the susceptible hosts. More specifically, an epidemic may result from the following:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>a recent increase in amount or virulence of the agent</li>
                    <li>the recent introduction of the agent into a setting where it has not been before</li>
                    <li>an enhanced mode of transmission so that more susceptibles are exposed</li>
                    <li>some change in the susceptibility of the host response to the agent</li>
                    <li>factors that increase host exposure or involve introduction through new portals of entry</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p><strong>Epidemic patterns</strong></p>
                <p>We sometimes classify epidemics by how they spread through a population, as shown below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Common source</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Point</li>
                            <li>Intermittent</li>
                            <li>Continuous</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Propagated</li>
                    <li>Mixed</li>
                    <li>Other</li>
                </ul>
                 <p>A <strong>common source outbreak</strong> is one in which a group of persons is exposed to a common noxious influence, such as an infectious agent or a toxin. If the group is exposed over a relatively brief period, so that everyone who becomes ill develops disease at the end of one incubation period, then the common source outbreak is further classified as a <strong>point source outbreak.</strong> When the number of cases in a point source epidemic is plotted over time, the resulting epidemic curve classically has a steep upslope and a more gradual downslope (a so-called ‚Äúlog-normal distribution").</p>
                <p>In some common source outbreaks, cases may be exposed over a period of days, weeks, or longer, with the exposure being either <strong>intermittent or continuous.</strong> When we plot the cases of a</p>
                 <p>continuous common source outbreak over time, the range of exposures and range of incubation periods tend to dampen and widen the peaks of the epidemic curve. Similarly, when we plot an intermittent common source outbreak we often find an irregular pattern that reflects the intermittent nature of the exposure.</p>
                 <p>An outbreak that does not have a common source, but instead spreads gradually from person to person usually growing as it spreads‚Äîis called a <strong>propagated outbreak.</strong> Usually transmission is by direct person-to-person contact, as with syphilis.</p>
                <p>Transmission may also be vehicle-borne, as the transmission of hepatitis B or HIV by sharing needles, or vector-borne, as the transmission of yellow fever by mosquitoes. In a propagated epidemic, cases occur over more than one incubation period. In theory, the epidemic curve of a propagated epidemic would have a successive series of peaks reflecting increasing numbers of cases in each generation. The epidemic usually wanes after a few generations, either because the number of susceptibles falls below some critical level, or because intervention measures become effective.</p>
                <p>Some epidemics may have <strong>features of both common source epidemics and propagated epidemics.</strong> The pattern of a common source outbreak followed by secondary person-to-person spread is not uncommon. These are called <strong>mixed epidemics.</strong></p>
                 <p>Finally, some epidemics are neither common source in its usual sense nor propagated from person-to-person. Outbreaks of zoonotic or vector-borne disease may result from sufficient prevalence of infection in host species, sufficient presence of vectors, and sufficient human vector interaction.</p>
                 <p><strong>The Epidemiologic Approach</strong></p>
                <p>An epidemiologist determines What, When, Where, Who, and Why. However, the epidemiologist is more likely to describe these concepts in slightly different terms: <strong>case definition, time, place, person, and causes.</strong></p>
                <p>As with all scientific endeavors, the practice of epidemiology relies on a systematic approach. In very simple terms, the epidemiologist:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Counts cases or health events, and describes them in terms of time, place, and person;</li>
                    <li>Divides the number of cases by an appropriate denominator to calculate rates; and</li>
                    <li>Compares these rates over time or for different groups of people.</li>
                </ul>
                 <p>Before counting cases, however, the epidemiologist must decide what a case is. This is done by developing a case definition. Then, using this case definition, the epidemiologist finds and</p>
                 <p>collects information about the case-patients. The epidemiologist then performs descriptive epidemiology by characterizing the cases collectively according to <strong>time, place, and person.</strong></p>
                 <p><strong>Case Definition:</strong>A case definition is a set of standard criteria for deciding whether a person has a particular disease or other health-related condition. By using a standard case definition we ensure that every case is diagnosed in the same way, regardless of when or where it occurred, or who identified it. We can then compare the number of cases of the disease that occurred in one time or place with the number that occurred at another time or another place.</p>
                 <p>With a standard case definition, when we find a difference in disease occurrence, we know it is likely to be a real difference rather than the result of differences in how cases were diagnosed.</p>
                <p>A case definition consists of clinical criteria and, sometimes, limitations on time, place, and person. The clinical criteria usually include confirmatory laboratory tests, if available, or combinations of symptoms (subjective complaints), signs (objective physical findings), and other findings.</p>
                 <p>A case definition may have several sets of criteria, depending on how certain the diagnosis is. For example, during an outbreak of measles, we might classify a person with a fever and rash as having a suspect, probable, or confirmed case of measles, depending on what additional evidence of measles was present. In other situations, we temporarily classify a case as suspect or probable until laboratory results are available. When we receive the laboratory report, we then reclassify the case as either confirmed or ‚Äúnot a case,‚Äù depending on the lab results. In the midst of a large outbreak of a disease caused by a known agent, we may permanently classify some cases as suspect or probable, because it is unnecessary and wasteful to run laboratory tests on every patient with a consistent clinical picture and a history of exposure (e.g., chickenpox).</p>
                <p>Case definitions should not rely on laboratory culture results alone, since organisms are sometimes present without causing disease.</p>
                <p>Case definitions may also vary according to the purpose for classifying the occurrences of a disease. For example, health officials need to know as soon as possible if anyone has symptoms of plague or foodborne botulism so that they can begin planning what actions to take. For such rare but potentially severe communicable diseases, where it is important to identify every possible case, health officials use a sensitive, or ‚Äúloose‚Äù case definition.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, investigators of the causes of a disease outbreak want to be certain that any person included in the investigation really had the disease. The investigator will prefer a specific or "strict" case definition. For instance, in an outbreak of Salmonella agona, the investigators would be more likely to identify the source of the infection if they included only persons who were confirmed to have been infected with that organism, rather than including anyone with acute diarrhoea, because some persons may have had diarrhoea from a different cause.

                <p><strong>Time</strong></p>
                <p>Disease rates change over time. Some of these changes occur regularly and can be predicted. For example, the seasonal increase of influenza cases with the onset of cold weather is a pattern that is familiar to everyone. By knowing when flu outbreaks will occur, health departments can time their flu shot campaigns effectively. Other disease rates make unpredictable changes. By examining events that precede a disease rate increase or decrease, we may identify causes and appropriate actions to control or prevent further occurrence of the disease. Depending on what event we are describing, we may be interested in a period of years or decades, or we may limit the period to days, weeks, or months when the number of cases reported is greater than normal (an epidemic period).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Secular (long-term) trends.</strong> Graphing the annual cases or rate of a disease over a period of years shows long-term or secular trends in the occurrence of the disease. We commonly use these trends to suggest or predict the future incidence of a disease</li>
                    <li><strong>Seasonality.</strong> By graphing the occurrence of a disease by week or month over the course of a year or more we can show its seasonal pattern, if any. Some diseases are known to have characteristic seasonal distributions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Day of week and time of day.</strong> Displaying data by days of the week or time of day may also be informative. Analysis at these shorter time periods is especially important for conditions that are potentially related to occupational or environmental exposures, which may occur at regularly scheduled intervals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Epidemic period.</strong> To show the time course of a disease outbreak or epidemic, we use a specialized graph called an <strong>epidemic curve</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Place</strong></p>
               <p>We describe a health event by place to gain insight into the geographical extent of the problem. For place, we may use place of residence, birthplace, place of employment, school district, hospital unit, etc., depending on which may be related to the occurrence of the health event. Similarly, we may use large or small geographic units: country, state, county, census tract, street address, map coordinates, or some other standard geographical designation. Sometimes, we may find it useful to analyse data according to place categories such as urban or rural, domestic or foreign, and institutional or non-institutional.</p>
               <p><strong>Person</strong></p>
               <p>In descriptive epidemiology, when we organize or analyse data by ‚Äúperson‚Äù there are several person categories available to us. We may use inherent characteristics of people (for example, age, race, sex), their acquired characteristics (immune or marital status), their activities (occupation, leisure activities, use of medications/tobacco/drugs), or the conditions under which they live (socioeconomic status, access to medical care). These categories determine to a large degree who is at greatest risk of experiencing some undesirable health condition, such as becoming infected with a particular disease organism. We may show person data in either tables or graphs.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Age.</strong> Age is probably the single most important ‚Äúperson‚Äù attribute, because almost every health-related event or state varies with age. A number of factors that also vary with age are behind this association: susceptibility, opportunity for exposure, latency or incubation period of the disease, and physiologic response (which affects, among other things, disease development).</li>
                    <li><strong>Sex.</strong> In general, males have higher rates of illness and death than females do for a wide range of diseases. For some diseases, this sex-related difference is because of genetic, hormonal, anatomic, or other inherent differences between the sexes. These inherent differences affect their susceptibility or physiologic responses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ethnic and racial groups.</strong> In examining epidemiologic data, we are interested in any group of people who have lived together long enough to acquire common characteristics, either biologically or socially. Several terms are commonly used to identify such groups: race, nationality, religion, or local reproductive or social groups, such as tribes and other geographically or socially isolated groups.</li>
                    <li><strong>Socioeconomic status.</strong> Socioeconomic status is difficult to quantify. It is made up of many variables such as occupation, family income, educational achievement, living conditions, and social standing. The variables that are easiest to measure may not reflect the overall concept. Nevertheless, we commonly use occupation, family income, and educational achievement, while recognizing that these do not measure socioeconomic status precisely.</li>
