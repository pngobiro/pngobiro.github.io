                    <p><strong>Infection:</strong> Infection is the entry and development or multiplication of an infectious agent in the body of man or animals. An infection does not always cause illness.</p>
                    <p><strong>Contamination:</strong> The presence of an infectious agent on a body surface, on or in clothes, beddings, surgical instruments or dressings, or other articles or substances including water and food</p>
                    <p><strong>Infestation:</strong> It is the lodgment, development and reproduction of arthropods on the surface of the body or in the clothing, e.g. lice, itch mite. This term could be also used to describe the invasion of the gut by parasitic worms, e.g. Ascariasis</p>
                    <p><strong>Contagious disease:</strong> is a disease that is transmitted through contact. Examples include scabies, trachoma, STD and leprosy</p>
                    <p><strong>Host:</strong> A person or an animal that affords subsistence or lodgement to an infectious agent under natural conditions. An animal or an organism, or human being that harbours an infectious agent or disease</p>
                    <p><strong>Vector:</strong> An insect or any living carrier that transports an infectious agent from an infected individual or its wastes to a susceptible individual or its food or immediate surroundings</p>
                    <p><strong>Reservoir:</strong> Any person, animal, arthropod, plant, soil, or substance, or a combination of these, in which an infectious agent normally lives and multiplies, on which it depends primarily for survival, and where it reproduces itself in such a manner that it can be transmitted to a susceptible host. It is the natural habitat of the infectious agent.</p>

                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <p><strong>Incidence of an infectious disease:</strong> number of new cases in a given time period expressed as percent infected per year (cumulative incidence) or number per person time of observation (incidence density).</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevalence of an infectious disease:</strong> number of cases at a given time expressed as a percent at a given time. Prevalence is a product of incidence x duration of disease, and is of little interest if an infectious disease is of short duration (i.e., measles), but may be of interest if an infectious disease is of long duration (i.e. chronic hepatitis B).</p>
                    <p><strong>Epidemic:</strong> The unusual occurrence in a community of disease, specific health related behavior, or other health related events clearly in excess of expected occurrence</p>
                    <p><strong>Endemic:</strong> It refers to the constant presence of a disease or infectious agent within a given geographic area or population group. It is the usual or expected frequency of disease within a population.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pandemic and Exotic</h3>
                    <p>An epidemic usually affecting a large proportion of the population, occuring over a wide geographic area such as a section of a nation, the entire nation, a continent or the world, e.g. Influenza pandemics.</p>
                    <p><strong>Exotic diseases</strong> are those which are imported into a country in which they do not otherwise occur, as for example, rabies in the UK</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Sporadic</h3>
                    <p>The word sporadic means "scattered about". The cases occur irregularly, haphazardly from time to time, and generally infrequently. The cases are few and separated widely in time and place that they show no or little connection with each other, nor a recognizable common source of infection e.g. polio, meningococcal meningitis, tetanus....</p>
                    <p>However, a sporadic disease could be the starting point of an epidemic when the conditions are favorable for its spread</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Zoonosis, epizootic and enzootic</h3>
                    <p><strong>Zoonosis</strong> is an infection that is transmissible under natural conditions from vertebrate animals to man, e.g. rabies, plague, bovine tuberculosis.....</p>
                    <p>An <strong>epizotic</strong> is an outbreak (epidemic) of disease in an animal population, e.g. rift valley fever.</p>
                    <p>An <strong>Enzotic</strong> is an endemic occurring in animals, e.g. bovine TB</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nosocomial infections</h3>
                    <p><strong>Nosocomial (hospital acquired) infection</strong> is an infection originating in a patient while in a hospital or another health care facility. It has to be a new disorder unrelated to the patient's primary condition. Examples include infection of surgical wounds, hepatitis B and urinary tract infetions</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Opportunistic infection</h3>
                    <p>This is infection by organisms that take the opportunity provided by a defect in host defense (e.g. immunity) to infect the host and thus cause disease. For example, opportunistic infections are very common in AIDS. Organisms include Herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Eradication and Elimination</h3>
                    <p>Termination of all transmission of infection by the extermination of the infectious agent through surveillance and containment. Eradication is an absolute process, an "all or none" phenomenon, restricted to termination of infection from the whole world. The term elimination is sometimes used to describe eradication of a disease from a large geographic region. Disease which are amenable to elimination in the meantime are polio, measles and diphtheria</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Source or Reservoir</h3>
                    <p>The starting point for the occurrence of a communicable disease is the existence of a reservoir or source of infection. The source of infection is defined as "the person, animal, object or substance from which an infectious agent passes or is disseminated to the host (immediate source). The reservoir is "any person, animal, arthropod, plant, soil, or substance, or a combination of these, in which an infectious agent normally lives and multiplies, on which it depends primarily for survival, and where it reproduces itself in such a manner that it can be transmitted to a susceptible host. It is the natural habitat of the infectious agent</p>

                    <p>A case is defined as "a person in the population or study group identified as having the particular disease, health disorder, or condition under investigation"</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Carriers</h4>
                    <p>It is "an infected person or animal that harbors a specific infectious agent in the absence of discernible (visible) clinical disease and serves as a potential source of infection to others</p>

                        <li>An infectious agent seeks a susceptible host aiming "successful parasitism".</li>
                        <li>Four stages are required for successful parasitism:
                            <ol>

                    <p><strong>Virulence:</strong> is the degree of pathogenicity; the disease evoking power of a micro-organism in a given host. Numerically expressed as the ratio of the number of cases of overt infection to the total number infected, as determined by immunoassay. When death is the only criterion of severity, this is the case fatality rate.</p>
                    <p><strong>Case fatality rate for infectious diseases:</strong> is the proportion of infected individuals who die of the infection. This is a function of the severity of the infection and is heavily influenced by how many mild cases are not diagnosed.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Incubation and Latent periods</h3>
                    <p><strong>Incubation period:</strong> time from exposure to development of disease. In other words, the time interval between invasion by an infectious agent and the appearance of the first sign or symptom of the disease in question.</p>
                    <p><strong>Latent period:</strong> the period between exposure and the onset of infectiousness (this may be shorter or longer than the incubation period).</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Communicable disease can be controlled and eradicated from the community. When thinking about the control of diseases it is always good to think of all the possible methods.</li>
                        <li>In most cases one or two specific methods will have the greatest effect and should be the focus of your activity, in other cases some methods will be useless against the disease. The aim of control is to tip the balance against the agent.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">The control and eradication of communicable diseases can be done by:</h3>
                    <p>There are three main methods of communicable disease control. They include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Attacking the source of the disease causing organism</li>
                        <li>Interrupting the transmission route</li>
                        <li>Protecting the susceptible host</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Attacking the Source</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are various specific measures which can be used to control the spread of an infectious disease. They include:</li>
                        <li>Treating the infected person or animal with the appropriate antibiotics that destroy the disease causing-organism.</li>
                        <li>Treating the carriers and sub-clinical cases after carrying out screening tests among suspected individuals or groups.</li>
                        <li>Treating specific groups of persons who are at high risk of being infected(mass treatment). This is called chemoprophylaxis.</li>
                        <li>Isolating those persons who are infected with highly infectious diseases such as ebola, marburg fever, lassa fever; so as to prevent the spread of the organism to other healthy people.</li>
                        <li>Treating sick animals such as cattle suffering from brucellosis, immunizing animals such as cows from anthrax, and dogs from rabies; killing sick animals such as rats to control plague and dogs to prevent rabies; separating humans from animals.</li>
                        <li>Notifying the local health authorities immediately you suspect a patient is suffering from an infectious disease.</li>
                        <li>Though this does not directly affect the source, it is an essential way of keeping watch on the number of new cases and thereby monitoring the effectiveness of the control programme</li>
                        <li>All of the methods mentioned in the above slides are methods of controlling the reservoir - where an animal is the reservoir.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">In summary you can state that the measures for attacking the source are:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Treating the infected person/s</li>
                        <li>Treating the carrier</li>
                        <li>Mass treatment of persons at risk</li>
                        <li>Isolating the infected person/s</li>
                        <li>Treating the sick animal such as cows</li>
                        <li>Immunizing animals such as dogs and cattle</li>
                        <li>Killing the animal reservoir such as rats</li>
                        <li>Separating humans and animals</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are five ways of attacking the source of disease micro-organism</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>I. Treatment:</strong> Refers to the use of drugs that destroy organism. When organism is destroyed, none of them are available to spread to the new host. It is useful in Control of TB,leprosy and STDs.</p>
                    <p><strong>II. Isolation:</strong> Refers to complete separation of a person or individual with a certain disease from others except those providing care. When the sick person is not allowed to come in contact with other people, the organism cannot spread. Is used to control highly infectious diseases such as Ebola, SARS, Measles.</p>
                    <p><strong>III. Reservoir control:</strong> Reservoir is any human , animal ,arthropod, plant,soil or inanimate matter in which the agent normally lives and multiplies. In those diseases that have their main reservoir in animals, mass treatment, chemoprophylaxis or immunization of animals can be carried out e.g brucellosis. Other ways of control at reseivor level include separating humans from animals or killing the affected animals and so destroying the reservoirs e.g Rabies</p>
                    <p><strong>IV. Chemoprophylaxis:</strong> Refers to the administration of a medication for the purpose of preventing disease or infection. Chemoprophylaxis can be carried out in animals that can transfer diseases to human beings</p>
                    <p><strong>V. Notification:</strong> Refers to informing the local health authorities of the presence or suspicion of infectious disease. The local health authorities can be sub county medical officer , sub county nurse, county public health nurse of County health director. It is an essential means of keeping watch on the number of new cases and therefore monitoring effectiveness of the control program.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Interrupting the Transmission Cycle</h4>
                    <p>A number of methods are used to interrupt the transmission cycle. Refers to breaking the chain of disease transmission. There are four main methods of interrupting transmission of micro-organisms.</p>
                    <p>They include :</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Environmental sanitation</li>
                        <li>personal hygiene and behavior change</li>
                        <li>vector control and disinfection and sterilization</li>
                        <li>Personal hygiene</li>
                        <li>Environmental health</li>
                        <li>Water and sanitation</li>
                        <li>Vector control</li>
                        <li>Good and adequate housing</li>
                        <li>Effective food handling and adequate nutrition</li>
                    </ul>

                        <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span> Remember:</h4>
                        <p>A clean environment and good personal hygiene are the most important measures in the primary prevention of diseases.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In addition to the measures covered in unit three, add sterilization of medical equipment and the use of sterile surgical equipment. These methods are useful for interrupting the transmission of diseases such as, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and hepatitis-B infection.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The most effective way of controlling communicable diseases is to use a combination of methods: attacking the source of the infecting organism, interrupting the route of transmission, and protecting the susceptible host.</p>
                        <p>There are various specific and general measures for protecting the host.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Immunisation using vaccines such as the KEPI vaccine</li>
                            <li>Chemoprophylaxis using for example: Proguanil (PaludrineR) to suppress malaria parasites Tetracycline during cholera outbreaks Cotrimoxazole during plague outbreaks</li>
                            <li>surveillance) on the number of new cases of communicable diseases in your area of work and to immediately inform the local health authority when you come across a patient suffering from an infectious disease.</li>
                            <li>One of the main reasons for notification is to help the health authorities take measures to confirm your suspicion and to control the spread of the disease.</li>
                            <li>Notification of infectious communicable diseases is the responsibility of all health care workers. It is also a legal requirement according to the Public Health Act, Chapter (cap) 242, section eight of the laws of Kenya.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is your responsibility to notify your local health authority immediately should you suspect the presence of an infectious disease.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Primordial prevention consists of actions and measures that inhibit the emergence of risk factors in the form of environmental, economic, social, and behavioral conditions and cultural patterns of living etc.</li>
                        <li>It is the prevention of the emergence or development of risk factors in countries or population groups in which they have not yet appeared</li>
                        <li>For example, many adult health problems (e.g.., obesity, hypertension) have their early origins in childhood, because this is the time when lifestyles are formed (for example, smoking, eating patterns, physical exercise).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Primary prevention</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Primary prevention can be defined as the action taken prior to the onset of disease, which removes the possibility that the disease will ever occur.</li>
                        <li>It signifies intervention in the pre-pathogenesis phase of a disease or health problem.</li>
                        <li>Primary prevention may be accomplished by measures of "Health promotion" and "specific protection"</li>
                        <li>It includes the concept of "positive health", a concept that encourages achievement and maintenance of "an acceptable level of health that will enable every individual to lead a socially and economically productive life".</li>
                        <li>Primary prevention may be accomplished by measures designed to promote general health and well-being, and quality of life of people or by</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>It is defined as " action which halts the progress of a disease at its incipient stage and prevents complications."</li>
                        <li>The specific interventions are: early diagnosis (e.g.. screening tests, and case finding programs....) and adequate treatment.</li>
                        <li>Secondary prevention attempts to arrest the disease process, restore health by seeking out unrecognized disease and treating it before irreversible pathological changes take place, and reverse communicability of infectious diseases.</li>
                        <li>It thus protects others from in the community from acquiring the infection and thus provide at once secondary prevention for the infected ones and primary prevention for their potential contacts.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Early diagnosis and treatment</h4>
                    <p>WHO Expert Committee in 1973 defined early detection of health disorders as "the detection of disturbances of homoeostatic and compensatory mechanism while biochemical, morphological and functional changes are still reversible."</p>
                    <p>The earlier the disease is diagnosed, and treated the better it is for prognosis of the case and in the prevention of the occurrence of other secondary cases.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Tertiary prevention</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is used when the disease process has advanced beyond its early stages.</li>
                        <li>It is defined as "all the measures available to reduce or limit impairments and disabilities, and to promote the patients' adjustment to irremediable conditions."</li>
                        <li>Intervention that should be accomplished in the stage of tertiary prevention are disability limitation, and rehabilitation.</li>

                    <p>Concept of control:</p>
                    <p>The term disease control describes ongoing operations aimed at reducing:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The incidence of disease</li>

                        <li>The effects of infection, including both the physical and psychosocial complications</li>
                        <li>The financial burden to the community.</li>
