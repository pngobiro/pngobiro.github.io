                    <p>Pulmonary Tuberculosis is an infectious disease of the parenchyma of the lungs caused by <strong>Mycobacterium tuberclosis</strong>.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Agent:</strong> Mycobacterium tuberclosis</li>
                        <li>Is a slender, straight or slightly curved bacillus</li>
                        <li>They are acid fast, non sporing, non capsulated non motile that stain blue with Ziehl Neelsen stain</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Source of infection</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Human:</strong> The pulmonary tuberculosis which affects the lungs accounts for 90%</li>
                        <li><strong>Bovine type:</strong> acquired through the drinking of infected animal milk. Accounts for 10%</li>
                        <li>Infective material is sputum of patient suffering from TB bacilli, pus, pleura and peritoneal fluid</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Host factors</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>More in male than females, common in males who are >40 yrs</li>
                        <li>Children under the age of two years are more susceptible than older ones</li>
                        <li>There is no inherited immunity for TB but is acquired through natural infection and BCG vaccine. This immunity can break in case of severe infection</li>
                        <li>There is increased tendency to develop disease during puberty and adolescent due to increased contacts</li>
                        <li>Poor nutrition increases risk</li>
                        <li>Infectious diseases such as HIV, measles and pertusis may reactivate TB</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Environmental factors; common in</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Overecrowded, insanitary and sub standard houses</li>
                        <li>Poverty/ low income families and low level of education and ignorance</li>
                        <li>Large families, malnutrition and occupation (doctors, nurses)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Source of infection in children is usually a member of house hold or a frequent family visitor</li>
                        <li>The child inhales micro droplets after someone coughs or sneezes</li>
                        <li>The droplets passes into bronchial tree and implants in a bronchiole or alveolus, and the tubercle starts to multiply</li>
                        <li>Epithelial cells surrounds and encapsulate the multiplying bacilli in attempt to wall off the organism forming the typical tubercle</li>
                        <li>During inflammation, some bacilli leave the focal area and are carried to the regional lymph nodes, causing fever. At this stage tuberculin is positive</li>
                        <li>Extension of the primary lesion at the original site causes progressive tissue destruction as it spreads within lungs, discharges material from foci to other areas of the lungs (bronchi or pleura) or produces pneumonia</li>
                        <li>Erosion of blood vessels may causes wide spread of tubercle bacillus to near and distant sites (miliary TB). Organisms deposited in the upper lung zones, bones, kidneys and brain may grow but those in bone marrow, liver and spleen are inhibited</li>
                        <li>Extra pulmonary TB may be manisted as superior lymphaadenitis, meningitis, osteoarthritis and may appear in the middle ear and mastoid and on the skin</li>
                        <li>Children with good immunity may remain aymptomatic and lesions usually heal. TB infection is manifestd only by positive skin tes</li>
                        <li>Active disease is manifested by positive skin test, postive chest x ray, positive sputim culture and signs of disease</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>General malaise</li>
                        <li>Prolonged fever</li>
                        <li>Anorexia</li>
                        <li>Weight loss and local signs of infection</li>
                        <li>Prolonged cough, aching pain, tightness in the chest and rarely hemoptysis</li>
                        <li>Examination of the affected lung; affected side does not expand as well as the other, diminished breath sounds, crackles are present, dullness on percusion</li>
                        <li>Fever in infants persist, the child develops pallor, anemia, weakness and weight loss</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Consider TB in any child with:</h3>
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">A history of:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unexplained weight loss or failure to grow normally</li>
                        <li>Unexplained fever, especially when it continues for longer than 2 weeks</li>
                        <li>Chronic cough (i.e. cough for > 14 days, with or without a wheeze)</li>
                        <li>Exposure to an adult with probable or defi nite infectious pulmonary TB.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">On examination:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fl uid on one side of the chest (reduced air entry, stony dullness to percussion)</li>
                        <li>Enlarged non-tender lymph nodes or a lymph node abscess, especially in the neck</li>
                        <li>Signs of meningitis, especially when these develop over several days and the spinal fl uid contains mostly lymphocytes and elevated protein</li>
                        <li>Abdominal swelling, with or without palpable lumps</li>
                        <li>Progressive swelling or deformity in the bone or a joint, including the spine</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">History and physical signs</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Try to obtain specimens for microscopic examination of acid-fast bacilli (Ziehl-Neelsen stain) and for culture of tubercle bacilli.</li>
                        <li>Possible specimens include three consecutive earlymorning, fasting gastric aspirates, CSF (if clinically indicated) and pleural fl uid and ascites fl uid (if present). A positive result confi rms TB, but a negative result does not exclude the disease</li>
                        <li><strong>Tuberculin test/Mantoux test;</strong> 2 to 3 weeks after primary infection, given intradermally. The test is usually positive in children with pulmonary TB (reactions of > 10 mm suggest TB; < 10 mm in a child previously vaccinated with BCG is equivocal).</li>
                        <li>The purifi ed protein derivative test may be negative in children with TB who have HIV/AIDS, miliary disease, severe malnutrition or recent measles</li>
                        <li>Obtain a chest X-ray. A diagnosis of TB is supported when a chest X-ray shows a miliary pattern of infi Itrates or a persistent area of infi Itrate or consolidation, often with pleural effusion, or a primary complexIn some patients, pleural effusion may be present also to include lymphatic nodes enlargement</li>
                        <li>Xpert MTB/RIF should be used as the initial diagnostic test in children suspected of having multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or HIV-associated TB.</li>
                        <li>Routine HIV testing should be offered to all children suspected of TB.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment</h3>
                    <p>Isoniazid (H): <strong>10 mg/kg</strong> (range, <strong>10-15 mg/kg</strong>); maximum dose, 300 mg/day</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">WHO</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Four-drug regimen: HRZE for 2 months, followed by a two-drug (HR) regimen for 4 months OR</li>
                        <li>Three-drug regimen: HRZ for 2 months, followed by a two-drug (HR) regimen for 4 months</li>
                        <li>In cases of suspected or confirmed tuberculous meningitis, spinal TB with neurological signs or osteo-articular TB, treat for 12 months with a four drug regimen (HRZE) for 2 months, followed by a two-drug (HR) regimen for 10 months;</li>
                        <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Streptomycin should not be used as part of fi rst-line treatment regimens for children with pulmonary TB or tuberculous peripheral lymphadenitis but reserved for treatment of multidrug-resistant TB</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Monitoring</h3>

                        <li>Confirm that the medication is being taken as instructed, by direct observation of each dose.</li>
                        <li>Monitor the child's weight gain daily and temperature twice a day in order to check for resolution of fever</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Public health issues</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Notify the case to the relevant authority</li>
                        <li>Children < 5 years of age who are household or close contacts of people with TB and who, after an appropriate clinical evaluation, are found not to have active TB should be given 6 months of isoniazid preventive therapy ( 10 mg/kg/day, range 7-15 mg/kg, maximum dose 300 mg/day)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nursing Management</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If admitted, the mother should be encouraged to stay and help with the child's care.</li>
                        <li>Nursing care should aim for infection control, bed rest and high protein diet with oral fluid intake.</li>
                        <li>The patient's personal body hygiene should be maintained at all times.</li>
                        <li>Usually the child will be prescribed daily antituberculous drugs, which you should administer continuously for a minimum of six months with at least two drugs. The drugs regimen can be selected from the following:</li>
                        <li>The dose will be determined according to the child's age and weight. The drugs have to be administered daily in combination to prevent bacterial drug resistance to one particular drug.</li>
                        <li>The drugs are very toxic and so the child should be observed very closely</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Preventive Measures</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All children have received their BCG vaccination.</li>
                        <li>Health education to members of the community so that the parents may bring their children to the clinic when infection is suspected and also avoid conditions that favour the disease</li>
                        <li>Maintain good health and nutrition</li>
                        <li>Pasteurization of milk and routine testing of milk Isolation of suspected and confirmed cases</li>

                        <li>Cure patients, prevent suffering and death from tb</li>
                        <li>Prevent long-term complications or sequelae of tb</li>
                        <li>Prevent relapse of the tb disease</li>

                        <li>Prevent the development of drug resistant tb</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">BASIC PRINCIPLES OF TB TREATMENT:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Never use single drugs</li>
                        <li>Always use drugs in combinations -using fixed dose combinations (fdcs)</li>
                        <li>Drug dosage is based on weight</li>
                        <li>Drug intake should be directly observed</li>
                        <li>Ensure the entire treatment is taken as recommended</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Before initiating treatment, classify patients according to the following classifications;</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>HIV status</li>
                        <li>Anatomical site</li>
                        <li>History of previous treatment</li>
                        <li>Drug resistance pattern</li>
                        <li>The regimen, duration of treatment, follow up investigations and adjunct medications and investigations is based on the above</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">CLASSIFICATION BASED ON ANATOMICAL SITES</h3>
                    <p><strong>Pulmonary TB(PTB)</strong>- Any bacteriologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed case of TB involving the lung parenchyma or the tracheobronchial tree. This exclude pleural effusion<br>
                    <strong>Extra pulmonary TB (EPTB)</strong>- ny bacteriologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed case of TB involving organs other than the lung parenchyma, e.g. pleura, lymph nodes, abdomen, genitourinary tract, skin, joints and bones, meninges.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Classification based on history of previous TB treatment (patient registration group)</h3>
                    <p><strong>New patients</strong>- Patient who has never been treated for TB or has taken anti-TB drugs for less than 1 month<br>
                    <strong>Previously treated patients</strong>- Patient who has received 1 month or more of anti-TB drugs in the past. They are further classified by the outcome of their most recent course of treatment as follows:</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li><strong>Relapse patients;</strong> previously treated for TB, declared cured or treatment completed at the end of their most recent course of treatment, and are now diagnosed with a recurrent episode of TB (either a true relapse or a new episode of TB caused by reinfection)</li>
                        <li><strong>Treatment after failure patients;</strong> previously treated for TB and whose treatment failed at the end of their most recent course of treatment</li>
                        <li><strong>Treatment after loss to follow-up patients;</strong> previously treated for TB, and declared lost to follow-up at the end of their most recent course of treatment. (These were previously known as return after default patients.)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Patients with unknown previous TB treatment history do not fit into any of the categories listed above</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">CLASSIFICATION BASED ON HIV STATUS</h3>
                    <p><strong>HIV-positive TB patient</strong>- Any case of TB who has a positive result from HIV testing conducted at the time of TB diagnosis or other documented evidence of enrolment in HIV care, such as enrolment in the preART register or in the ART register once ART has been started<br>
                    <strong>HIV-negative TB patient</strong>- Any case of TB who has a negative result from HIV testing conducted at the time of TB diagnosis. Any HIV-negative TB patient subsequently found to be HIV-positive should be reclassified accordingly<br>
                    <strong>HIV status unknown TB patient</strong>- Any case of TB who has no result of HIV testing and no other documented evidence of enrolment in HIV care. If the patient's HIV status is subsequently determined, he or she should be reclassified accordingly</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">CLASSIFICATION BASED ON DRUG RESISTANCE, BASED ON DRUG SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING</h3>
                    <p><strong>Monoresistance</strong>-Resistance to one first-line anti-TB drug only<br>

                        <li>Hepatitis A virus causes infectious hepatitis and is the most infectious of these viruses, while hepatitis B virus causes serum hepatitis (also called epidemic hepatitis).</li>
                        <li>The hepatitis B virus causes chronic active infection of the liver (hepatitis) which may be followed some ten years later by liver cirrhosis (in 10-20% of the patients).</li>
                        <li>In some of the patients who develop cirrhosis, the disease progresses to liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma).</li>
                        <li>Hepatitis B infection occurs in about 1-3% of the human beings, but the incidence may be higher in patients undergoing kidney dialysis and in cancer wards (due to repeated blood transfusions), and among children because of close personal contact.</li>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hepatitis A and E infections are transmitted through faecal-oral route and are both called infectious hepatitis.</li>
                        <li>Hepatitis B, C and D are transmitted through blood products and close personal contacts and are called serum hepatitis. Serum hepatitis may cause chronic liver infection and liver cirrhosis.</li>
                        <li>The human being is the only known reservoir and host of viral hepatitis.</li>
                        <li>Hepatitis B infection transmission takes place through two main routes:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Percutaneous route</strong> - this is through injections and transfusion of blood and blood products.</li>
                                <li><strong>Non-percutaneous routes</strong> - these include close personal contact for example, kissing and sexual intercourse, from mother to foetus through placenta or to baby during delivery.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All types of hepatitis infections are characterized by a similar clinical picture which manifest in two phases.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pre-icteric Phase (no jaundice)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fever of sudden onset</li>
                        <li>Malaise</li>
                        <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                        <li>Nausea</li>
                        <li>Abdominal discomfort</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Icteric Phase</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Appearance of jaundice</li>
                        <li>Enlarged tender liver (hepatomegaly)</li>
                        <li>Extreme tiredness and myalgia</li>
                        <li>Feelings of deep sadness (depression)</li>
                        <li>Pale stools</li>
                        <li>Dark urine (contains bilirubin)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The urine of a person suffering from viral hepatitis is dark and contains bilirubin, while the stool is usually pale.</li>
                        <li>In the blood, both direct and indirect bilirubin levels are raised. For hepatitis B, diagnosis is made by detecting various immunological markers in the blood. The most important is the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) which is present when the virus is in the blood in the acute stage and in the chronic carrier state.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                    <p>No specific treatment is available for both hepatitis A and B. The patient should be given symptomatic RX together with diet and bed rest at home to prevent the spread of the disease. If admission is indicated - ensure that the patient is isolated and extra precautions taken during handling and disposal of excreta. Alcohol increases the risk of cirrhosis, advise patient to avoid alcohol for at least six months.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improve environmental sanitation to prevent the transmission of hepatitis A.</li>
                        <li>Isolating patients suffering viral hepatitis</li>
                        <li>Administration of hepatitis vaccine</li>
                        <li>Screening blood for hepatitis B surface antigen before giving it for transfusion and excluding all donors with a history of jaundice</li>
                        <li>Effective sterilisation and high level disinfection of all instruments, needles and syringes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In addition to the hepatitis viruses, other viruses that can also cause hepatitis include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Herpes simplex</li>
                        <li>Cytomegalovirus</li>
                        <li>Epstein-Barr virus</li>
                        <li>Yellow fever</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">HEPATITIS A</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV), a picornavirus transmitted by the fecal-oral route often associated with ingestion of contaminated food.</li>
                        <li>It causes an acute form of hepatitis and does not have a chronic stage. The patient's immune system makes antibodies against HAV that confer immunity against future infection. People with hepatitis A are advised to rest, stay hydrated and avoid alcohol.</li>
                        <li>The time between the infection and the start of the illness averages 28 days (ranging from 15 to 50 days), and most recover fully within 2 months, although approximately 15% of sufferers may experience continuous or relapsing symptoms from six months to a year following initial diagnosis.</li>
                        <li>Is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food.</li>
                        <li>Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further HAV infections.</li>
                        <li>However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV.</li>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Acute infection is diagnosed by the detection of HAV-IgM in serum by EIA.</li>
                        <li>Past Infection i.e. immunity is determined by the detection of HAV-IgG by EIA (test Anti/HAV/total Ab).</li>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Hepatitis B</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is caused by hepatitis B virus, a hepadnavirus that can cause bothacute and chronic hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis develops in the 15% of adults who are unable to eliminate the virus after an initial infection. Identified methods of transmission include blood, tattoos, sexually, or via mother to child by breast feeding. However, in about half of cases the source of infection cannot be determined. Patients with chronic hepatitis B have antibodies against hepatitis B , but these antibodies are not enough to clear the infection of the affected liver cells.</li>
                        <li>The continued production of virus combined with antibodies is a likely cause of the immune complex disease seen in these patients.</li>
                        <li>A vaccine is available that will prevent infection from hepatitis B for life.</li>
                        <li>Is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids.</li>
                        <li>HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood.</li>
                        <li>Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use.</li>
                        <li>HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV.</li>

                    <p><strong>Sexual</strong>-sexworkers and homosexuals are particular at risk.<br>
                    <strong>Parenteral</strong> - IVDA, Health Workers are at increased risk.<br>
                    <strong>Perinatal</strong>-Mothers who are HBeAg positive are much more likely to transmit to their offspring than those who are not. Perinatal transmission is the main means of transmission in high prevalence populations.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">DIAGNOSIS.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>HBsAg</strong> - used as a general marker of infection.</li>
                        <li><strong>HBsAb</strong> - used to document recovery and/or immunity to HBV infection.</li>
                        <li><strong>anti-HBc/IgM</strong> - marker of acute infection.</li>
                        <li><strong>anti-HBc/IgG</strong> - past or chronic infection.</li>
                        <li><strong>HBeAg</strong> - indicates active replication of virus and therefore infectiveness.</li>
                        <li><strong>HBV-DNA</strong> - indicates active replication of virus, more accurate than HBeAg especially in cases of escape mutants. Used mainly for monitoring response to therapy.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">TREATMENT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Interferon</strong> - for HBeAg positive carriers with chronic active hepatitis. Response rate is 30 to 40%.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lamivudine</strong> - a NRTI</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">PREVENTION</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vaccination of those at increased risk of HBV infection - Health care workers. Neonates.</li>
                        <li>HBIG may be used to protect persons who are exposed to hepatitis B.</li>
                        <li>It is efficacious within 48 hours of the incident.</li>
                        <li>It may also be given to neonates whose mothers are HBsAg and HBeAg positive.</li>
                        <li>Other measures - screening of blood donors, blood and body fluid precautions.</li>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">HEPATITIS C</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV), an RNA virus that is a member of the Flaviviridae family.</li>
                        <li>HCV can be transmitted through contact with blood and can also cross the placenta. Hepatitis C usually leads to chronic hepatitis, culminating in cirrhosis in some people. It usually remains asymptomatic for decades. Patients with hepatitis C are susceptible to severe hepatitis if they contract either hepatitis A or B , so all persons with hepatitis C should be immunized against hepatitis A and hepatitis B if they are not already immune, and avoid alcohol. HCV viral levels can be reduced to undetectable levels by a combination of interferon and the antiviral drug ribavirin.</li>
                        <li>Is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood.</li>
                        <li>This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use.</li>
                        <li>Sexual transmission is also possible, but is much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Risk Factors Associated with Transmission of HCV</h4>

                        <li>Accidental injuries with needles/sharps</li>
                        <li>Sexual/household exposure to anti-HCV-positive contact</li>
                        <li>Multiple sex partners</li>
                        <li>Birth to HCV-infected mother</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Interferon</strong> - may be considered for patients with chronic active hepatitis. The response rate is around 50% but 50% of responders will relapse upon withdrawal of treatment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ribavirin</strong> - there is less experience with ribavirin than interferon. However, recent studies suggest that a combination of interferon and ribavirin is more effective than interferon alone.</li>

                        <li>The ways in which hepatitis D is spread are by shared needles among drug abusers, contaminated blood, and by sexual contact.</li>
                        <li>Infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection.</li>

                        <li>Hepatitis B, C and D are transmitted through blood products and close personal contacts and are called serum hepatitis. Serum hepatitis may cause chronic liver infection and liver cirrhosis.</li>
                        <li>The human being is the only known reservoir and host of viral hepatitis.</li>
                        <li>The disease is transmitted from the infected person to the susceptible host through faeces, contaminated food and objects, blood, blood serum and other body fluids</li>
