                    <p>An infection of a neonate by anaerobic organism called clostridium tetani. A fatal infection common in the developing countries.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The infection is acquired by exposure to the spores of the bacterium to the umbilicus stamp which are universally present in the soil/faeces</li>
                        <li>The disease is caused by the action of potent neurotoxins (tetanospasmin) produced during the growth of bacterium in dead tissues e.g. umbilical stump.</li>
                        <li>Organism - Clostridium tetani</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Early diagnosis of cases and contacts; for isolation and treatment, disinfection of nasal phayngeal discharges</li>
                        <li>Antibiotics; eryrthromycin is the DOC. Others are ampicillin, tetracycline</li>
                        <li>Keep away infants and young children from cases</li>
                        <li>Prophylaxis; active immunization with pentavalent vaccine or pertusis vaccine or DPT</li>
                        <li>Health education; avoid contact with infected person for atleast 4 wks after onset. Single cough produce lots of bacteria and any time a child spend with an infected person can lead to transmission</li>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nursing Management</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep the child in warm and humid env free of draughts, plenty of fresh air free from dust, wind and smoke, and sunshine (out doors)</li>
                        <li>Keep the patient quiet, avoid un due excitement or anything that provokes crying or fright</li>
                        <li>Isolation; isolate patient, teach child how to use paper handkerchief while coughing, cleans all article used by patients immediately, remove contaminated linen so as not to soil clean area</li>
                        <li>Diet; give an extra meal; avoid to hot or too cold (avoid ice drinks) meals, give small frequent meals butslowly. If the child vomits, wait for approx 15 minutes before continuing. After feeding burp the child and place her in the left lateral position</li>
                        <li>Fever; it is usually high when bronchopneumonia is present. Maintain adequate fluid intake</li>
                        <li>To prevent hernia, may use tight abdominal binder, which may also control vomiting</li>
                        <li>Oxygen therapy is given continuously or when the child is cyanosed.</li>
                        <li>Maintain a fluid balance chart and observe the child's vital signs such as the temperature, pulse and respiration. Record any findings every two to four hours until the condition improves.</li>
                        <li>Give health education to the parents. Continue to maintain the child's personal hygiene.</li>

                        <li>Is an acute highly infectious viral disease of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and sometimes of the lower part of the brain (medulla and cortex)characterized by sudden onset of fever.</li>
                        <li>Is a complication of a viral infection which is usually confined to the pharynx and gastro-intestinal tract, but the virus can gain entry into the nervous system and settles in the motor cells of the anterior horn of the spinal cord or in the medulla oblangata</li>
                        <li>Some factors, which contribute to the invasion of the nervous system include muscular exhaustion, tooth extraction, tonsillectomy, injections and damaged nerve endings. The invasion finally leads to paralysis</li>
                        <li>It occurs sporadically or is epidemiologically</li>
                        <li>It is common in Africa and Asia</li>
                        <li>It was classified as a public health problem in this country in 1950.</li>
                        <li>It is characterised by varying degrees of paralysis.</li>
                        <li>The poliovirus is of three types and child has to be immunized against all these viruses to develop full immunity</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Type one is called Brunhilde; is commonly associated with paralytic illness (85%) and major epidemic.<br>
                    Type two is called Lansing usually causes sporadic cases<br>

                        <li>Temp of 50 degrees destroys virus rapidly but milk and ice cream protects the virus to up to 60 degrees but destroyed by pasteurization at 62 degrees</li>
                        <li>In absence of organic matter that protect the virus, free chlorine at 0.3 to 0.5 mg/L inactivates it</li>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                    <p>Poliovirus enters GIT by ingestion and then spread to various organs.</p>
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Replication occurs in 3 phases</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Phase 1; primary replication</strong> - Occurs in the oropharynx and intestinal mucosa and also subjacent lymphoid tissue</li>
                        <li><strong>Phase 2</strong> - Virus spread via draining lymphatic into regional lymph nodes and undergoes further replication and amplification. It then enters blood stream and results into in transient viraemia which manifest as mild and febrile illness</li>
                        <li><strong>Phase 3</strong> - Virus disseminate into various extraneural tissues. Extensive replication takes place producing persistent viraemia. From blood the virus enters the CNS. The virus attacks the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord where the motor pathways are located and may cause motor paralysis. The posterior horn is not affected. It can also attack medullar and basal structures of the brain including the cranial nerves causing bulbar poliomyelitis</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Abortive poliomyelitis</h4>
                    <p>Characterised by influenza like symptoms pus one or more of the malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, sorethroat, constipation, localized abdominal pain and fever more than 103F</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Non-Paralytic Type</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Symptoms like abortive but headache, nausea, vomiting are more intense. There is also stiffness of the posterior muscles of the neck, trunk and limbs</li>
                        <li>Non paralysis but can change to a paralytic type as a result of any kind of stress, by IM injection, walking long distances and cold weather</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Paralytic Type</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Spinal form</strong> - Paralysis of flaccid type usually asymmetric and scattered in distribution, with legs affected most</li>
                        <li><strong>Bulbar form</strong> - Involves facial, palatal and pharyngeal muscle; change in voice, difficult in swallowing, nasal regurgitation and choking. Resp paralysis is common and causes death.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnostic Investigations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A lumbar puncture should be performed to exclude the possibility of meningitis.</li>
                        <li>Cerebral Spinal Fluid is usually clear in colour. Both lymphocytes and polymorphs may be present in the CSF. High WBC, Normal sugar</li>
                        <li>Isolation of the virus from nasopharyngeal swabs in the first 5days of illness, and from stools and rectal stools up to 5weeks afteronset</li>
                        <li>Serology for the risen antibodies</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment</h3>
                    <p>No special treatment is available.</p>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management of Poliomyelitis</h3>
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Acute stage</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The patient is strictly confined to bed : activities in the first two weeks of the infection risk possible increased paralysis</li>
                        <li>The patient is to be nursed in isolation</li>
                        <li>Pain is controlled through the administration of analgesics, for example, paracetamol, valium or phenobarbitone</li>
                        <li>Regular respiratory suction and postural drainage should be performed</li>
                        <li>N.G tube feeding should be high calorie and include substantial amounts of protein</li>
                        <li>Change the patient's position every four hours to prevent bedsores</li>
                        <li>Surgical procedures should also be avoided</li>
                        <li>No injections are to be administered during this acute stage as they may precipitate paralysis Immobilise the affected limbs during the acute stage of the illness, using splints to prevent flexion deformities and promote rest.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">After the acute stage has passed, (6wks from onset)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Begin gradual and gentle exercise of the affected limbs. Recovery may take 6 mo but may extent to 2 yrs</li>
                        <li>Ensure proper disposal of faeces and urine to prevent spread of infection.</li>
                        <li>Urinary catheterisation must be passed but principles of asepsis must be observed strictly.</li>
                        <li>Maintain an intravenous infusion and fluid balance chart.</li>
                        <li>Oxygen therapy may be used when necessary. A tracheotomy and use of a mechanical respirator may be used should the patient's condition deteriorate.</li>
                        <li>Hydrotherapy (in swimming pool); the limbs are bit lighter in water and the patient gets psychological uplift</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Discharge</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>After being discharged, the child should return to the clinic at regular intervals to ensure flexion deformities do not occur.</li>
                        <li>A plaster of Paris or back slab should be applied to the limbs if these deformities actually occur.</li>
                        <li>Special shoes and callipers may help severely affected children.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention and control</h3>
                    <p>Protection of the susceptible by immunization is most effective method. It breaks the chain of transmission. Immunize all the children in infancy before 6months</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Report the case to the authorities</li>
                        <li>Isolate the patient for 1 wk for the onset of the disease or as long as there is fever</li>
                        <li>Ensure proper disposal of urine and feces of the patient</li>
                        <li>All sources of water must be protected, swimming baths must be chlorinated</li>
                        <li>Milk must be pasteurized and fruits should be washed with weak potassium permanganate solution before using</li>
                        <li>Avoid overcrowding of children in schools, cinemas, playgrounds etc</li>
                        <li>Children must avoid excessive physical straining during epidemic</li>
                        <li>Search for sick persons, investigate contacts and source of infection</li>
                        <li>Antifly measures should be adopted</li>
                        <li>Active immunization with OPV during outbreak is important</li>
                        <li>All suspected carriers must gargle with potassium permanganate solution and take four small spoons of sulfadiazine in a day</li>
                        <li>Educate the community about the disease and its consequences</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">METHODS OF IMMUNIZATION</h3>
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Active immunization</h4>
                    <p>Done using inactivated polio vaccine(IPV) and OPV</p>
                    <h5>1. IPV (Salk type)</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is a liquid killed vaccine (by formalin), contains all three types of polioviruses, given as IM</li>
                        <li>It only stimulate the production of only systemic (humoral) antibodies but not intestinal or local immunity so the wild polio can still multiply in the intestines hence become a source of infection</li>
                        <li>It is not recommended during epidemics because immunity is not developed with one dose. Besides its injection may provoke paralysis</li>
                        <li>It does not provide life immunity, booster doses are required once in 5 yrs</li>
                        <li>However, its safe for immunocompromised persons and stable</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>2. Oral polio vaccine (sabin vaccine)</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's a live liquid vaccine that contain all three types of polioviruses</li>
                        <li>It's the drug of choice for immunization against polio</li>
                        <li>It is given as oral two dropsper dose</li>
                        <li>Polio zero given at birth results in development of gut immunity only not systemic immunity, subsequent three doses helps develops both local gut and systemic immunity</li>
                        <li>It stimulate production of Ig A in the gut and Ig G in the circulation</li>
                        <li>It can help develop herd immunity and can help eradicate poliomyelitis i.e When immunized child drinks contaminated water, the virus is inactivated by lgA, which when it enters the mouth of a susceptible child it induces immunity indirectly</li>
                        <li>If all children are immunized simultaneously and no single child is left, the virus replaces the wild polio virus</li>
                        <li>It is the vaccine of choice in epidemics</li>
                        <li>Its adm is simple and easy</li>
                        <li>However, since it's a live vaccine, its multiplication in the intestines may result in a resistant strain that may cause vaccine associated paralytic poliomyelitis</li>
                        <li>Do not the vaccine in acute febrile illness, diarrheal disease, steroid therapy etc</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">WHY IT IS POSSIBLE TO ERADICATE POLIOMYELITIS</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Human beings are the only reservoir of infection</li>
                        <li>There is no chronic carrier state</li>
                        <li>Half life of wild polio virus in feces is short (hardly 48 hrs )</li>
                        <li>The available vaccine is a Jive vaccine, stabilized, highly potent, cheap and easily adm and safe</li>
                        <li>An OPV can develop herd immunity indirectly</li>
                        <li>OPV replaces wild polio viruses from nature by inducing gut and systemic immunity</li>
                        <li>Correct and complete dosage schedule confers life long immunity</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <p><strong>Infectious Agent:</strong> Rubella virus.</p>
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Presentation</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rubella is most often a mild viral illness associated with rash in approximately half of infections. Asymptomatic infections occur.</li>
                        <li>Generally, a prodrome occurs 1-5 days before the onset of rash which may be characterized by lowgrade fever, headache, mild coryza, malaise and conjunctivitis. Children usually have few or no symptoms. Lymphadenopathy, involving occipital, post auricular and posterior cervical nodes, may start 5-10 days prior to the rash onset and is the most characteristic sign. Transient arthralgia and, less frequently, arthritis may occur in up to onethird of women and usually begins at the same time as the rash or shortly afterwards.</li>
                        <li>The rash is diffuse, punctate (red pinpoint), and maculopapular. It is often itchy and begins on the face.</li>
                        <li>The usual duration is 3-5 days. Clinically, Rubella is indistinguishable from febrile rash illnesses caused by measles, parvovirus B19, human herpes virus 6 (HHV6), Coxsackie virus, ECHO virus, adenovirus and dengue virus, and laboratory confirmation is required for diagnosis unless there is an epidemiological link to a confirmed case.</li>
                        <li>Rare complications include chronic arthritis and encephalitis in adults, and thrombocytopenia in children.</li>
                        <li>Rubella is important because of its ability to produce anomalies in the developing fetus if the infection is acquired in the first trimester of pregnancy (refer to Section 7.9.1 Congenital Rubella protocol).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnostics</h3>
                    <p>The clinical diagnosis of Rubella is often difficult as Rubella has many symptoms in common with other rash illnesses.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>IgM antibodies develop about 5 days post rash onset. IgM antibodies can persist for 6 weeks after the rash onset. If the IgM is negative and the sample has been taken on or before the fifth day post rash onset, another specimen should be taken as soon as possible (more than 5 days post rash onset).</li>
                        <li>Seroconversion or a significant rise in rubella IgG between acute an convalescent sera collected at least 10 days apart will assist with the diagnosis of infection.</li>
                        <li>Isolation of rubella virus from the nose, throat, cerebral spinal fluid, urine or blood can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Ideal specimens are respiratory (nasopharyngeal or throat swabs). Specimens should be obtained as soon as possible after onset (less than 4-5 days post onset).</li>
                        <li>Follow your regional laboratory procedures for testing.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment</h3>
                    <p>Supportive treatment as indicated. No specific treatment is available for Rubella.</p>

                    <p>This is a mild viral infection, which is extremely contagious. Its characterized by Fever, malaise and a typical pruritic skin lesions.</p>
                    <p>The causative organism is; Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) a member of Herpesvirus group. Source of virus; oropharynx, skin, mucous membrane and blood</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Transmission</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Direct or indirect contact, the wind can transmit the virus particles from the skin of the infected person over a distance of meters to another person.</li>
                        <li>Dry scabs and nut infections.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once infected, the disease leaves immunity against chicken pox but the virus remains within the body and may reappear later in adult life as the herpes zoster when the person's immunity is weakened, for example in AIDS, diabetes, leukaemia and old age.</p>

                    <p>Virus gain entry thro mucosa of upper resp tract. Causes viraemia and circulation through blood and then becomes localized to the skin.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The virus then produces swelling of the epithelium cells and accumulation of fluid producing vesicle</li>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestation</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Begins with mild headache, backache, moderate fever and malaise in the first 24 hrs then followed by a rash and itching</li>
                        <li>Later, lesion appear in oropharynx which ruptures to form an ulcer, that causes painful swallowing</li>
                        <li>Maculopaular Cutaneous rash appear over 1 to 5 days, first appearing in the back, chest, or on the forehead or face, becomes numerous on the trunk and face and relatively sparse over the extremities</li>
                        <li>On the extremities, the flexor muscles appear more affected than in extensor (distribution to palms and soles is seldom)</li>
                        <li>The skin lesions develop as small, deep pink, slightly raised, ovoid papules, which within few hours become fragile, thin walled translucent, umbilicated, glistening bleb like vesicles containing clear fluid surrounded by small red areolar in the super layer of the skin</li>
                        <li>The vesicles later change to crusts and finally slough out in 7 to 14 days</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> MACULOPAPULAR FOR FEW HRS, VESICULAR FOR 3 TO 4 DAYS AND LEAVES A GRANULAR SCAB</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Once infected, the disease leaves immunity against chicken pox but the virus remains within the body and may reappear later in adult life as the herpes zoster when the person's immunity is weakened</p>

                        <li>Occurs in children btn 5 to 15 yrs ,</li>
                        <li>it is more severe in adults than children</li>
                        <li>One attack of clinical or sub clinical induce life long immunity</li>
                        <li>Most infants below 6 months are immune coz of maternal antibodies</li>
                        <li>Most infections in children under 2 yrs are subclinical</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Source of infection</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Human are the only reservoir i.e those suffering from mumps or those with subclinical mumps</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Methods of spread</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It can spread by droplets or contact with the salivary secretions of the infected person, airborne, formites</li>
                        <li>The virus can be found in blood, urine, human milk, CSF, saliva</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>On average between 14 and 21 days of infectivity after the onset of the parotid glands swelling</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Communicability</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is 4 to 6 days after onset before parotitis and a week or more (9 days) after the onset of parotitis</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The infection causes desquamation of epithelium in the ducts of parotid gland, interstitial edema and Lymphocytic infiltration within the lumina</li>
                        <li>The gland enlarges, displacing the ear lobe outwards and upwards</li>
                        <li>The enlargement is painful and tender but begins to subside in 7 to 10 days where temperature subsides</li>
                        <li>Unilateral parotitis is the most common form</li>
                        <li>It may affects other organs esp in adults e.g testes, pancrease, CNS, ovaries, prostate, breast, joints, eyes, ears</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The salivary glands namely the parotid, sublingual and submaxillary glands may be infected by painful swelling, this may be one side or both sides</li>
                        <li>Swelling of parotid gland is the first indication; the patients complains of pain and stiffness on opening the mouth before the swelling</li>
                        <li>There may be also sore throat, fever, ear ache and painful chewing before the onset</li>
                        <li>Fever subsides after 48hrs of onset</li>
                        <li>Complains of headache and malaise may be present</li>
                        <li>The tongue is furred and mouth dry due to diminished saliva</li>
                        <li>Moderate lymphocytosis is noted on blood examination</li>
                        <li>The tenderness may last two to three days then gradually subside</li>

                        <li>Maintain bed rest in a warm room until swelling subsides esp in acute phase</li>
                        <li>An adult should remain in bed until swelling has subsided for atleast 3 days because ambulation increases the incidence of orchitis in males</li>
                        <li>Give analgesics and antipyretics as required to control pain and temperature</li>
                        <li>Encourage fluids and soft bland foods that do not require chewing</li>
                        <li>Avoid foods which contain acid because they may increase pain</li>
                        <li>Apply heat or cold compress to neck whichever is more comfortable</li>
                        <li>Observe the child's vital signs of temperature, pulse and respiration and record them every four hours</li>
                        <li>Cleanliness; daily cleansing bath and brushing because the secretions are usually dirty</li>
