                        <li>An acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae.</li>
                        <li>Researchers have estimated that there are 1.4 to 4.3 million cases, and 28000 to 142000 deaths worldwide due to cholera every year.</li>
                        <li>Up to 80% of cases can be successfully treated with oral rehydration salts.</li>
                        <li>Has a short incubation period of two hours to five days hence a potentially explosive pattern of outbreaks.</li>
                        <li>Provision of safe water and sanitation is critical in reducing the impact of cholera and other waterborne diseases.</li>
                        <li>Oral cholera vaccines are considered an additional means to control cholera</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">CAUSES</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vibrio cholerae which Has 2 strains; O 1 and O 139</li>
                        <li>Evidence of other strains in Africa and Asia shown to be more virulent and high case fatality</li>
                        <li>Main reservoirs of V. cholerae are people and aquatic sources such as brackish water and estuaries, often associated with algal blooms</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">CLINICAL FEATURES</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>About 75% of people infected with V. cholerae are asymptomatic, though the bacteria are present in their faeces for 7-14 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people.</li>
                        <li>Of the remaining 25%, 80% have mild or moderate symptoms, while around 20% develop acute watery diarrhoea with severe dehydration</li>
                        <li>The ISS have a poor prognosis upon infection</li>
                        <li>Incubation period is about 2-3 days</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In severe cholera, the disease develops in three stages:-</p>
                    <p><strong>Stage 1:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lasts for 3-12 hours</li>
                        <li>Profuse watery diarrhea pours from the patient</li>
                        <li>Soon fecal matter disappears and clear fluid with mucus flakes (rice water) appears.</li>
                        <li>Vomiting follows diarrhea</li>
                        <li>Abdominal cramps starts due to salts loss</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Stage 2:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is collapse from dehydration</li>
                        <li>The body becomes cold, dry and inelastic.</li>
                        <li>Rapid and feeble pulse</li>
                        <li>Low (unrecordable) blood pressures</li>
                        <li>Anuria</li>
                        <li>Death may occur from shock</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Stage 3:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is stage of recovery</li>
                        <li>Diarrhea decreases, patient is able to drink and dehydration improves rapidly</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most bacteria, when consumed, do not survive the acidic conditions of the human stomach. The few surviving bacteria conserve their energy and stored nutrients during the passage through the stomach by shutting down much protein production. When the surviving bacteria exit the stomach and reach the small intestine, they need to propel themselves through the thick mucus</li>
                        <li>The small intestine to get to the intestinal walls, where they can thrive. V. cholerae bacteria start up production of the hollow cylindrical protein flagellin to make flagella, the cork-screw helical fibers they rotate to propel themselves through the mucus of the small intestine.</li>
                        <li>Once the cholera bacteria reach the intestinal wall, They stop producing the protein flagellin. On reaching the intestinal wall, V. Cholerae start producing the toxic proteins that give the infected person a watery diarrhea. This carries the multiplying new generations of V. cholerae bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host if proper sanitation measures are not in place.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Risk factors and disease burden</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inadequate environmental management</li>
                        <li>Peri-urban slums and IDP/refugee camps</li>
                        <li>Poor water and sanitation practices</li>
                        <li>Inadequate or lack of good personal hygiene measures</li>
                        <li>Lack of adequate appropriate domestic practices</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cholera is an easily treatable disease.</li>
                        <li>Up to 80% of people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration salts</li>
                        <li>Very severely dehydrated patients require administration of I.V fluids.</li>
                        <li>Appropriate antibiotics to diminish the duration of diarrhoea, reduce the volume of rehydration fluids needed, and shorten the duration of V. cholerae excretion.</li>
                        <li>Mass administration of antibiotics is not recommended, as it has no effect on the spread of cholera and contributes to increasing antimicrobial resistance.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention and control</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A multidisciplinary approach based on prevention, preparedness and response</li>
                        <li>An efficient surveillance system</li>
                        <li>Practice other preventive and control measures</li>
                        <li>All these will help mitigate cholera outbreaks, control cholera in endemic areas and reduce deaths.</li>
                        <li>Currently there are 2 WHO pre-qualified oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) (Dukoral® and Shanchol®) .Dukoral® is administered to adults and children aged >6 years in 2 doses; and to children aged >2 years and <6 years in 3 dose. Shanchol's immunization schedule is 2 doses given at an interval of 2 weeks for those aged >1 year</li>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>It is an infection caused by a pathogenic amoeba, Entamobea histolytica. Infection with amoeba is in most cases asymptomatic. Under certain circumstances, the amoeba may invade the bowel wall causing amoebic dysentery.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Epidemiology</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is acquired when the cysts are ingested. The emerging trophozites takes up residence in the ascending large bowel where it can live as a commensal or begin penetrating the intestinal wall causing small mucosal ulcerations which result in dysentery.</li>
                        <li>The parasite penetrates through the sub mucosa and into the muscularis layer of the colon.</li>
                        <li>If the muscularis layer becomes extensively involved, scarring can result (amoeboma).</li>
                        <li>Invasion of bloodstream by the trophozite may led to infection of the liver, especially the right lobe. After a variable incubation period, a liver abscess may form.</li>
                        <li>The only infective form of E. histolytica is the cyst. If trophozites are ingested they are destroyed in the stomach.</li>
                        <li>An asymptomatic cyst-passer forms the main reservoir for spread of amoebiasis.</li>
                        <li>Cysts are passed from person to person by the faecal-oral route. Amoebiasis can occur in families or spread through institutions but usually doesn't occur in epidemics like Bacillary dysentry.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Persons at greatest risk for amoebiasis include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>people who have traveled to tropical locations with poor sanitation</li>
                        <li>immigrants from tropical countries with poor sanitary conditions</li>
                        <li>people who live in institutions with poor sanitary conditions, such as prisons</li>
                        <li>Food handlers may transmit the cysts while preparing or handling food.</li>
                        <li>Transmission is also possible during anal sex or colonic irrigation.</li>
                        <li>people with compromised immune systems and other health conditions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical picture</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When amoeba penetrate the intestinal wall, they multiply in the sub-mucosa causing bottle shaped ulcers.</li>
                        <li>From the ulcers the amoeba may be transported to the liver.</li>
                        <li>Amoeboma- this is where by the scar in the colon heals while the parasite is still in the tissue. This results in an abscess and keloids.</li>
                        <li>Amoebic dysentery is insidious and associated with abdominal discomfort. There may be mildly loose stool or frank diarrhoea with or without blood and mucous</li>
                        <li>Distended colon</li>
                        <li>Chronic amoebiasis may resemble duodenal ulcer, gall bladder disease or carcinoma of the colon.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Other extra-intestinal manifestation</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Amoebiasis of the skin may occur where amoeba come into contact with the skin, that is:

                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>An amoebic skin ulcer is irregular and painful. The ulcer enlarges continuously because of necrosis of the edges.</li>
                        <li>When a liver abscess breaks through into the chest cavity, a lung abscess or empyema may occur.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Endemic in many regions of East Africa, although epidemic outbreaks have occurred when a source of water or food used by many people has been contaminated</li>
                        <li>Human beings are the only known reservoir and host.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mode of transmission</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mainly spread by the faecal-oral route through contaminated food, water and milk.</li>
                        <li>Flies are also important in the transmission</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Incubation Period</h4>
                    <p>The incubation period of typhoid fever is 7-21 days</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Features</h4>
                    <p>The disease has a gradual onset which progresses through the following four stages.</p>
                    <p><strong>First Stage</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>patient has severe headache, malaise, loss of appetite, body pains and aches and a tendency to nose-bleed</li>
                        <li>The body temperature rises day by day or in steps to 39.5°C or higher.</li>
                        <li>Most patients cough because they develop bronchitis and may also complain of constipation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Second Stage</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>temperature continues to rise, but the pulse rate is slower than would be expected for that temperature.</li>
                        <li>There is swelling of lymphoid tissue in the intestines as well as Peyer's patches necrosis and ulcers, which cause the abdomen to become distended and tender</li>
                        <li>The high temperature and toxaemia causes mental confusion and disorientation in the patient.</li>
                        <li>Half the patients may develop greenish watery ('pea-soup') diarrhoea and bronchopneumonia.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Third Stage</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Body temperature decreases step by step and the patient improves slowly</li>
                        <li>If there is no improvement, the Peyer's patches in the intestines perforate and toxaemia increases.</li>
                        <li>The patient becomes delirious and incontinent of urine and stool, muscles twitch and coma may precede death</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Fourth Stage:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For the patients who do not suffer the serious complications of the third stage, the fourth stage is a period of convalescence.</li>
                        <li>The temperature drops back to normal and the patient recovers gradually.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Diagnosis</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>best way to diagnose typhoid fever is through a blood culture.</li>
                        <li>Stool and urine cultures can also be made although they are only positive after the first week</li>
                        <li>Other tests:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Widal test during the first and second week</li>
                                <li>WBC count which indicates low levels (leucopenia) with raised lymphocyte count</li>
                                <li>Stool to check for presence of occult blood which is found in 100% of the cases</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fluid replacement due to diarrhoea</li>
                        <li>Oral norfloxacin 400 mg 12 hourly for 10-14 days</li>
                        <li>Oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bd. for 14 days</li>
                        <li>Oral corticosteroids to prevent Jarisch-Herxheimer's reaction</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Intestinal perforation leading to peritonitis and sepsis</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identification of the carriers especially those who work as food handlers and treat them promptly</li>

                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">PARATYPHOID FEVER</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is caused by bacteria known as salmonella paratyphi types A, B and C . The disease runs a milder course than typhoid fever and also has enlargement of the spleen, bloodstained diarrhoea and swelling of the Peyer's patches</li>
                        <li>Paratyphoid fever may present like typhoid fever, but in most cases it presents as gastroenteritis or transient diarrhoea</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                    <p>The treatment of paratyphoid fever is as follows:-</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Intravenous fluid if diarrhoea is severe</li>
                        <li>Oral rehydration if diarrhoea is mild</li>
                        <li>Oral contrimoxazole two tablets bd. for five to seven days</li>

                    <p>Bacillary dysentery, also known as shigellosis, is an acute bacterial disease of the intestines.</p>
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Aetiology</h3>
                    <p>It is caused by a non-motile gram-negative bacilli of the genus shigella spp. The organisms responsible for outbreaks are:</p>
                    <ol type="i">

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Epidemiology</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is common especially in areas where the standards of hygiene are low, particularly, where there is scarcity of safe water, improper human excreta disposal, large population of flies and child malnutrition. Humans are the only known reservoir</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>After a few motions (usually in a few hours) diarrhoea stops and is followed by severe colicky abdominal pain known as dysenteric syndrome, and painful contractions of the sphincter ani which produce an irresistible urge to defecate</li>
                        <li>Patient they pass small amounts of purulent mucus and blood.</li>
                        <li>Vomiting may also occur</li>
                        <li>Toxins produced by the shigella on the wall of the colon may be absorbed into the blood stream resulting in toxaemia -high fever and rapid pulse</li>
                        <li>Dehydration is also common and dangerous as it may cause muscular cramps, oliguria and shock.</li>

                        <li>Malnutrition</li>
                        <li>Old age</li>
                        <li>Pregnancy</li>
                        <li>Immunosuppresion</li>
                        <li>Use of corticosteroid therapy to suppress the immune system</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Causative Agent</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Entamoeba histolytica.</li>
                        <li>Definitive host is the human being.</li>
                        <li>Habitat is the large intestine of the host especially the caecum and colon where it can exist in two forms:
                            <ul>
                                <li>As a cyst</li>
                                <li>As a trophozoite</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Trophozoite form is the pathogenic form (active form), which feeds on bacteria and tissues</li>
                        <li>Trophozoites dominates in liquid stools but rapidly die once discharged out of the body as it cannot withstand the outside environment</li>
                        <li>Some trophozoites in the colonic lumen become cysts and are excreted with stool.</li>
                        <li>cystic form predominates in formed stools and is resistant to the external environment</li>
                        <li>They are non-pathogenic but infective. They do not invade the cells but once swallowed they are capable of hatching out (encysting) after passing the stomach and the small intestines.</li>
                        <li>The daughter cells become the trophozoites.</li>
                        <li>The cyst can live outside the body for 10 days even more and can resist extreme temperatures such as on heating and refrigeration. They are however killed by boiling (temperature above 100°C).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">pathogenesis</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once the cysts are ingested, the emerging trophozoites take up residence in the intestinal mucosa.</li>
                        <li>The organisms multiply in the mucosa (causing the formation of bottle-shaped ulcers each 1-2 cm in diameter). Too many such ulcers may cover the large intestine. Some of the ulcers may become perforated leading to severe peritonitis with shock. In the small intestines, the entamoeba histolytica may pass through the mucous membrane and enter the liver. After a variable incubation period a liver abscess may form.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Transmission</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>fecal_oral_route</li>
                        <li>can also be transmitted indirectly through contact with dirty hands or objects (fomites) as well as by anal-oral contact.</li>
                        <li>Infections can occur from drinking water but it' really not a water-borne disease.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Incubation Period</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>about 2 to 4 weeks.</li>
                        <li>It can however be as long as 11 weeks.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Picture</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Many people remain asymptomatic (the cystpassers).</li>
                        <li>With tissue invasion, symptoms can range from mild diarrhea to dysentery with blood and mucus in the stool (foul smelling diarrhoea)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Other symptoms</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>intermittent diarrhea with constipation (pea-soap diarrhea)</li>
                        <li>flatulence and cramping abdominal pain.</li>
                        <li>Tenderness over the liver or ascending colon may occur and stools may contain mucus and blood.</li>
                        <li>Severe amoebiasis infections occur in two major forms
                            <ul>
                                <li>Invasion of the intestinal lining causes amoebic dysentery or amoebic_colitis</li>
                                <li>If the parasite reaches the bloodstream it can spread through the body, most frequently ending up in the liver where it causes amoebic_liver abscesses</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">EXTRA-INTESTINAL AMOEBIC DISEASE</h3>
                    <p>The most common site for extra-intestinal amoebiasis is the liver where it forms a liver abscess. Other secondary sites include lungs and skin leading to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Amoebic infection of the skin</li>
                        <li>Amoebic balanitis</li>
                        <li>Amoebic lung abscess</li>
                        <li>Amoebic brain abscess</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Investigations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Stool for Cyst (Microscopy)</strong>-The E. histolytica cyst is quadrinucleated. Asymptomatic human infections are usually diagnosed by finding cysts shed in the stool. Since cysts are not shed constantly, a minimum of three stools should be examined. In symptomatic infections, the motile form (the trophozoite) can often be seen in fresh feces.</li>
                        <li><strong>Serological Tests</strong> -Serological tests exist and most individuals (whether with symptoms or not) will test positive for the presence of antibodies. levels of antibody are much higher in individuals with liver abscesses. Serological tests are useful in detecting infection by E. histolytica if the organism goes extra-intestinal and in excluding the organism from the diagnosis of other disorders. Note that positive serological result may not necessarily indicate an active infection. A negative serological result however can be equally important in excluding suspected tissue invasion by E. histolytica.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sigmoidoscopy</strong>- To visualize the GI mucosa for ulcerations but this is not specific.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Case Management</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>two different types of amoebicides (tissue and luminal) are needed to treat the infection, one for each location.</li>
                        <li>Asymptomatic cyst carriers (luminal amoebiasis)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Treat only if patient is a food handler.</li>
                                <li>Use entamizole/dilazole (metronidazole-diloxanide furoate)</li>
                                <li>Adults: 500 mg TDS x 10/7</li>
                                <li>Children: 30-50 mg/kg TDS x 10/7</li>
                                <li>Dilazole/dirazole is a combination of metronidazole and diloxanide furoate hence effective for both luminal and tissue amoebiasis.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">TISSUE AMOEBIASIS (AMOEBIC DYSENTERY)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Metronidazole, or a related drug such as tinidazole</li>
                        <li>Metronidazole (Flagyl) 400-800mg po TDS for 5 days (children: 30-50 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses.</li>
                        <li>Tinidazole (fasigyn, tinycos) 2g OD po for 3 days (children: 50 mg/kg per dose</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Luminal Amoebiasis</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>paromomycin (Humatin) and diloxanide furoate (also known as furamide). These are however not essential in Kenya.</li>
                        <li>Paromomycin: 500 mg po TDS x 10/7 Furamide: 500 mg po TDS x 10/7</li>
                        <li>Entamizole/Dilazole: 500 mg po TDS x 10/7</li>
                        <li>Children: 30-50 mg/kg po TDS x 10/7</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Health Education</li>
                        <li><strong>Food Handlers</strong>- They should be medically examined between 6 months and 1 year so that cyst-passers, if any, are treated and stopped from handling food</li>
                        <li><strong>Food Hygiene</strong>- must be properly and hygienically handled to avoid contamination for instance by fecal matter that may contain the cysts.</li>
                        <li>Environmental Hygiene and Sanitation</li>
                        <li><strong>Water Supplies</strong>-Public water supplies should be protected from any contamination by fecal matter</li>
