                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Detailed SARS Information</h3>
                    <p><strong>Infectious Agent:</strong> Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is caused by a coronavirus similar on electron microscopy to animal coronaviruses. Coronaviruses are large, enveloped RNA viruses.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clinical Presentation:</strong> SARS illness generally presents with malaise, myalgia and fever, quickly followed by respiratory symptoms including cough and shortness of breath. Diarrhea may occur. Symptoms may worsen for several days coinciding with viraemia at 10 days after onset. Nearly all confirmed infected adult cases developed pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.</p>
                    <p><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Consult your local laboratory.</p>
                    <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Consult with physician.</p>
                    <p><strong>Occurrence:</strong> Worldwide: First recognized in February 2003, the disease is thought to have originated in the Guangdong province of China, with emergence into human populations sometime in November 2002. By July 2003, major outbreaks had occurred at 6 sites, with disease occurrence reported in more than 20 additional sites throughout the world, following major airline routes. Most cases occurred in hospitals and among families and close contacts of hospital workers. There have been no cases of SARS identified since the 2003 outbreaks. Canada: The first case of SARS was detected in Toronto, which was the epicenter of the outbreak in Canada. In all, there were 251 cases of SARS diagnosed in Canada, mostly in the Toronto area; 43 patients died. Nunavut: No reported cases.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reservoir:</strong> Unknown.</p>
                    <p><strong>Transmission:</strong> SARS is transmitted from person-toperson by close contact (i.e. within 1 or 2 meters); caring for, living with, or direct contact with infectious respiratory secretions or body fluids of a suspected, or confirmed case of SARS. The virus is thought to be transmitted most readily through respiratory droplets and possibly fomites (a surface or object contaminated with infectious droplets).</p>
                    <p><strong>Incubation Period:</strong> 3-10 days.</p>
                    <p><strong>Communicability:</strong> Not yet completely understood. Initial studies suggest that transmission does not occur before onset of clinical signs and symptoms, and that maximum period of communicability is less than 21 days. During the 2003 outbreak, health workers were at great risk of disease acquisition, especially when exposed to aerosolgenerating procedures such as intubations. In 2003, health care workers served as an entry point of the disease into the community in North America.</p>
                    <p><strong>Susceptibility and Resistance:</strong> Unknown but susceptibility is assumed to be universal. At present race and sex do not appear to alter susceptibility. Because of the small number of cases reported among children, it has not been possible to assess the influence of age. The clinical course appears to be much milder and shorter among cases less than 12 years of age.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>This is an acute and dangerous bacterial disease, which occurs sporadically and in epidemics.</li>
                        <li>The causative bacterium is the Neisseria meningitides, also known as meningococcal</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are two types of meningitis.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first type known as meningococcal meningitis is spread by droplets from one person to another and may cause epidemics in crowded institutions such as army barracks, boarding schools, prisons and camps.</li>
                        <li>The second type is caused by a variety of other organisms usually occurring as a complication of some other disease in the body, or by direct extension from neighboring structures such as the middle ear (otitis media).</li>
                        <li>This type of meningitis occurs one case at a time, that is, it is sporadic.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>About 20-25% of people may be healthy carriers of the meningococcal and the other organisms which cause meningitis, such as, haemophilus influenzae type B and streptococcus pneumonia (pneumococci).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Transmission of the neisseria meningitides occurs by direct contact and by droplets from nasal and throat discharges of infected persons.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Features</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When a susceptible host is infected the organism causes blood poisoning (septicaemia ) and pyogenic meningitis.</li>
                        <li>The onset is sudden with the following signs and symptoms:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Severe headache and neck</li>
                                <li>Rigidity Fever and rigors</li>
                                <li>Pain in the back and limbs Irritability and confusion</li>
                                <li>Drowsiness and coma</li>
                                <li>Positive Kernig's and Brudzinki's signs On lumbar puncture</li>
                                <li>Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) is under pressure and contains high levels of White Blood Cells (WBCs)</li>
                                <li>Has raised protein and lowered glucose</li>
                                <li>Petechial haemorrhages</li>
                                <li>Circulatory collapse (Waterhouse- Friderichson syndrome)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Diagnosis</h4>
                    <p>The following tests are useful to confirm a diagnosis:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lumbar puncture</li>
                        <li>Positive Kernig's sign</li>
                        <li>Positive Brudzinki's 1 and 2 signs</li>
                        <li>Blood culture for neisseria meningitides</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                    <p>The patient must be admitted in the hospital and antibiotic therapy started immediately. Either one of the following drugs can be given:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>IM crystalline penicillin (benzyl penicillin) six mega units stat followed by three mega units every six hours</li>
                        <li>IM chloramphenicol 500 mg every six hours</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h4>
                    <p>The prevention of meningitis follows the same principles that were covered in the other airborne diseases. They include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improvement in housing:
                            <ul>

                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that can cause symptoms from common cold to more severe disease such as pneumonia and eventually it may lead to death especially those in vulnerable groups such as the elderly, the very young, and people with an underlying chronic health condition.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Limited information is available to characterize the spectrum of clinical illness associated with COVID19.</li>
                        <li>The CDC clinical criteria for a COVID-19 patient under investigation (PUI) have been developed based on what is known about MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and are subject to change as additional information becomes available.</li>
                        <li>Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-toperson spread.</li>
                        <li>However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Coronaviruses are common in many different species of animals, including bats, camels, cats, and cattle</li>
                        <li>COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus, like MERS and SARS, allof which have their origins in bats.</li>
                        <li>The sequences from US patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.</li>
                        <li>When person-to-person spread has occurred with MERS and SARS, it is thought to have happened mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread</li>
                        <li>Most coronaviruses infect animals, but not people; in the future, one or more of these other coronaviruses could potentially evolve and spread to humans, as has happened in the past.</li>
                        <li>Many of the patients have direct or indirect contact with the Wuhan Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market that is believed to be the original place of the outbreak of COVID-19.</li>
                        <li>However, the transmission of COVID-19 from fish to humans is unlikely.</li>
                        <li>The COVID-19 and fish coronaviruses such as Beluga Whale CoV/SW1 belong to different genera and apparently have different host ranges.</li>
                        <li>As the Wuhan market seafood market also sells other animals, the natural host of COVID-19 awaits to be identified.</li>
                        <li>Due to the possibility of transmission from animal to human, CoVs in livestock and other animals including bats and wild animals sold on the market should be constantly monitored.</li>
                        <li>In addition, more and more evidence indicates the new virus COVID-19 is spread via the route of human-to-human transmission because there are infections of people who did not visit Wuhan but had close contact with family members who had visited Wuhan and got infected.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Causes</h3>
                    <p>Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. There are four main sub-groupings of coronaviruses, known as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. Human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid1960s. The seven coronaviruses that can infect people are 229E (alpha coronavirus), NL63 (alpha coronavirus, OC43 (beta coronavirus), and HKU1 (beta coronavirus). Other human coronaviruses are MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and COVID-19</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Statistics and Incidences</h3>
                    <p>An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City was initially reported to WHO on December 31, 2019. Chinese health authorities have confirmed more than 40 infections with a novel coronavirus as the cause of the outbreak. Reportedly, most patients had epidemiological links to a large seafood and animal market; the market was closed on January 1, 2020. Globally, there are 597,250 confirmed cases and 27,365 deaths confirmed as of March 28, 2020</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For confirmed COVID-19 infections, reported illnesses have ranged from people being mildly sick to people being severely ill and dying; these symptoms may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 after exposure based on what has been seen previously as the incubation period of MERS viruses.</li>
                        <li>Fever</li>
                        <li>Dry cough</li>
                        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                        <li>Sorethroat</li>
                        <li>Runny nose</li>
                        <li>Diarrhea</li>
                        <li>Fatigue/tiredness</li>
                        <li>Difficulty of breathing (in severe cases)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To increase the likelihood of detecting infection, CDC recommends collection of three specimen types: lower respiratory, upper respiratory, and serum specimens for testing</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Medical Management</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this coronavirus.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hand hygiene.</strong> Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; if water and soap are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Keep hands off your face.</strong> Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                        <li><strong>Maintain social distancing.</strong> Avoid close contact with people at least 3 feet ( 1 meter) who are sick, and stay at home when you are sick.</li>
                        <li><strong>Proper cough and sneeze etiquette.</strong> Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
                        <li><strong>Supportive care.</strong> People infected with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Severe cases.</strong> For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">For Healthcare Workers</h4>

                                <li><strong>Monitor vital signs.</strong> Monitor the patient's temperature; the infection usually begins with a high temperature; monitor the respiratory rate of the patient as shortness of breath is another common symptom.</li>
                                <li><strong>Monitor O2 saturation.</strong> Monitor the patient's O2 saturation because respiratory compromise results in hypoxia</li>
                                <li><strong>Maintain respiratory isolation.</strong> Keep tissues at the patient's bedside; dispose secretions properly; intsruct the patient to cover mouth when coughing or sneezing; use masks, and advise those entering the room to wear masks as well; place respiratory stickers on chart, linens, and so on.</li>
                                <li><strong>Enforce strict hand hygiene.</strong> Teach the patient and folks to wash hands after coughing to reduce or prevent the transmission of the virus.</li>
                                <li><strong>Manage hyperthermia.</strong> Use appropriate therapy for elevated temperature to maintain normothermia and reduce metabolic needs.</li>
                                <li><strong>Educate the patient and folks.</strong> Provide information on disease transmission, diagnostic testing, disease process, complications, and protection from the virus.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Evaluation</strong>
                            <ul>

                                <li>Patient was able to improve body temperature levels.</li>
                                <li>Patient was able to restore breathing pattern back to normal.</li>
                                <li>Patient was able to reduce anxiety.</li>
                            </ul>
