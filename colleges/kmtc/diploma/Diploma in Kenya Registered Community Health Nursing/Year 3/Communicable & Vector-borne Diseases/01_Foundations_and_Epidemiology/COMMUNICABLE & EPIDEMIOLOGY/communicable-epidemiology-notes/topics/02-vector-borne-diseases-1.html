                    <p>The organisms which cause vector-borne diseases usually undergo part of their development inside the vectors themselves. The time taken by the disease-causing organism to develop inside the vector is called the extrinsic incubation period. Although the housefly is an insect that is known to carry bacteria and chlamydia, it is not considered a vector. This is because it is merely a mechanical transmitter of disease; the organisms do not develop inside its body.</p>
                    <p>The majority of vectors are insects with the mosquito being the most common. This is because the mosquito is responsible for transmitting more diseases than any other vector. Insect vectors usually acquire disease organisms by sucking blood from infected persons. They then transmit the infection by depositing infected faeces or body fluids in skin cracks or abrasions. Most vectors have quite specific breeding, feeding and attacking behaviour. They therefore only thrive in areas where suitable conditions exist for their survival. As a result, vector-borne diseases tend to be present all the time (endemic) in a given geographical area or population.</p>
                    <p>Many of the diseases transmitted by vectors can also become epidemic, especially when there are environmental or other changes leading to increased transmission. Some serious epidemics which have occurred in Africa have been as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yellow fever: Ethiopia, Sudan, Nigeria, Ghana</li>
                        <li>Trypanosomiasis: Uganda</li>
                        <li>Kala Azar: Kenya, Sudan</li>
                        <li>Plague: Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania</li>
                        <li>Typhus fever: Burundi, Rwanda, Ethiopia</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When communicable diseases are present in animals all the time, such as the case of yellow fever in monkeys and plague in rats, the disease is said to be enzootic (epidemic in animals).</p>

                    <p>Malaria is an acute infection of the bloodcaused by protozoa of the genus plasmodium. Malaria is directly or indirectly responsible for much illhealth and death, especially of children. The vector responsible for the transmission of malaria is the anopheles mosquito (anopheles gambiae and anopheles funestus), which thrive in humid, warm climates where water is available.The parasites develop properly in the mosquito in places where the mean temperature is 16-32°C. The cooler the environmental temperature the longer it takes for the parasites to develop in the mosquito. The parasite takes about 35-36 days to develop at a mean daily temperature of 16°C, and nine days when the mean daily temperature is 30°C or above.Mosquitoes have an average life span of two to four months.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">There are three Anopheles species in Africa</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Anopheles gambiae:</strong> most important vector in Africa.Feed in temporary water bodies such as pools</li>
                        <li><strong>Anopheles funetus:</strong> Breed in permanent vegetation such as swamps and rice fields</li>
                        <li><strong>Anopheles melas:</strong> adapted to slightly salty water.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">The people at risk from malaria include:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Children under 5 years of age</li>
                        <li>Travelers from non-malaria area</li>
                        <li>People with sickle cell disease</li>
                        <li>Women in their first pregnancy {malaria thrives in placenta}</li>
                        <li>Splenectomised patients</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Malaria Epidemiology</h3>
                    <p>Malaria is caused by the plasmodium (parasite) that is transmitted to human beings by the bite of the infected female anopheles mosquito. There are four plasmodium species and any of them can cause malaria. They are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plasmodium falciparum</li>
                        <li>Plasmodium malariae</li>
                        <li>Plasmodium ovale</li>
                        <li>Plasmodium vivax</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In Kenya 98% of malaria is caused by plasmodium falciparum. The other 2% of the cases are caused by plasmodium malariae and plasmodium ovale. Malaria caused by plasmodium vivax is very rare. Malaria due to plasmodium falciparum is usually the most severe form of malaria and is called malignant malaria. The mortality rate due to malaria is highest in children under five years of age</p>
                    
                    <p>In Kenya, malaria occurs in two patterns:</p>
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Endemic Malaria</h4>
                    <p>Endemic malaria (also called 'stable malaria') is transmitted all the year round. This type of malaria is found around Lake Victoria and the coastal region of Kenya. Endemic malaria causes severe infection in children under five years of age and in pregnant mothers. The mortality rate is high among infected children. After repeated bites by infected mosquitoes older children and adults develop partial immunity to malaria.</p>
                    <p>NB// Endemic malaria is transmitted all the year and severely affects children under five years old and pregnant mothers.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Epidemic Malaria</h4>
                    <p>Epidemic malaria (also called ‘unstable malaria’) occurs seasonally and affects people of all ages. Seasonal malaria occurs in Machakos, Embu, Kitui, Tharaka and Marigat in Baringo.</p>
                    <p>Another form of epidemic malaria occurs in the highlands and those areas bordering endemic zones. This type of malaria is called highland malaria and is seen seasonally and affects all people severely. Highland malaria epidemics have had high mortality rates. The areas in Kenya which have been affected by highland malaria include Kisii, Nyamira, Kericho, Turkana and Narok.</p>
                    <p>Note// Epidemic malaria occurs seasonally and affects people of all ages.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Transmission and Life Cycle of Malaria</h3>
                    <p>Malaria parasites develop in two cycles:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first cycle takes place in the mosquito and the other cycle in the infected human being.</li>
                        <li>The first cycle which takes place in the mosquito is called the sexual cycle, while that which takes place in the human being is called the asexual cycle.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Asexual Cycle</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sporozoites in mosquito's salivary gland are injected into host via proboscis of mosquito. They stay in circulation for 30 minutes then rapidly migrate to the liver. A sporozoite is a spore formed after fertilization.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hepatic {liver} stage: {exo-erythrocytic stage}</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Takes 9-14 days</li>
                                <li>sporozoite is taken up by the kupffer cells of the liver and then passes through into hepatocytes or liver cells.</li>
                                <li>Sporozoite mature into hepatic Schizont</li>
                                <li>Each schizont multiplies into thousands of other forms called merozoites which are released into general circulation</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Hypnozoites:</strong> This stage only occurs in Plasmodium ovale and P.vivax. The hypnozoite mature unpredictably and release new merozoites responsible for recurrent infections upto 18 months after primary infection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Erythrocytic or blood stage:</strong> Merozoites released from liver invade individual red blood cells and mature to become Trophozoites and then develop with RBCs into blood schizonts. The schizonts then rapture the RBC releasing numerous merozoites which invade new RBCs. This part of cycle causes clinical illness and the length of time each RBC cycle gives periodicity of the symptoms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gametocytes:</strong> some of the merozoites in red blood cells develop into sexual forms of the parasite, called male and female gametocytes</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">In mosquitoes {sexual reproduction}</h4>
                    <ol start="6">
                        <li><strong>Sexual reproduction:</strong> male and female gametocytes develop into gametes and then fuse in stomach to form a zygote. Develop into a mobile form called ookinete which migrate through the wall of stomach to form an oocyst</li>
                        <li><strong>Oocyst:</strong> This matures and releases sporozoites</li>
                        <li><strong>Sporozoites:</strong> these migrate into salivary gland ready for delivery with mosquito's next meal.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Sexual Cycle</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The sexual cycle of the malaria parasite takes place in the body of the female anopheles mosquito.</li>
                        <li>This cycle begins when the feeding mosquito sucks blood containing the male and female gametocytes.</li>
                        <li>In the stomach of the mosquito, the male gametocytes mate with the female gametocytes.</li>
                        <li>The fertilised gametocyte is called the ookinete</li>
                        <li>The ookinete stays in the stomach of a mosquito for about 12-18 hours after which it penetrates the stomach wall.</li>
                        <li>Upon reaching the outer surface of the stomach wall, the ookinete changes into an oocyst</li>
                        <li>The oocysts grow rapidly and burst releasing large numbers of sporozoites into the body cavity of the mosquito.</li>
                        <li>Many of the sporozoites move to the salivary glands of the mosquito from where they are injected into the body of the next human being when the mosquito feeds.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology of malaria</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A female Anopheles mosquito carrying malaria-causing parasites feeds on a human and injects the parasites in the form of sporozoites into the bloodstream. The sporozoites travel to the liver and invade liver cells.</li>
                        <li>Over 5-16 days*, the sporozoites grow, divide, and produce tens of thousands of haploid forms, called merozoites, per liver cell.</li>
                        <li>The merozoites exit the liver cells and re-enter the bloodstream, beginning a cycle of invasion of red blood cells, known as asexual replication. In the red blood cells they develop into mature schizonts, which rupture, releasing newly formed merozoites that then reinvade other red blood cells. This cycle of invasion and cell rupture repeats every 1-3 days* and can result in thousands of parasite-infected red blood cells in the host bloodstream, leading to illness and complications of malaria that can last for months if not treated</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical picture</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sporozoites and liver stages do not cause clinical symptoms</li>
                        <li>Symptoms develop when the invaded RBCs rapture to release new merozoites and vasoactive peptides which activate immune system</li>
                        <li>Vasoactive peptides are hormones produce in intestine.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features of Malaria</h3>
                    <p>The incubation period of malaria is about 10-14 days after the infection. The symptoms appear once the invaded erythrocytes rupture to release new merozoites. This stimulates the body's immune system and the signs and symptoms of malaria then appear:</p>

                        <li><strong>The Cold Stage:</strong> This stage starts suddenly and lasts for fifteen minutes to one hour. The patient's body temperature rises and they shiver. During this stage, the infected erythrocytes rupture releasing merozoites in the blood circulation.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Hot Stage:</strong> The hot stage last for two to six hours. The body temperature is high (40-41°C) with severe headache, nausea and vomiting. The skin is hot and dry.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Sweating Stage:</strong> The fever drops rapidly and the patient sweats profusely. This stage last for two to four hours. The patient is relieved but exhausted.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The spleen enlarges with each attack of malaria because the spleen has to clear the damaged red blood cells and produce antibodies</li>
                        <li>Anemia results from 2 main factors,hemolysis of parasitized red cells and some bone marrow suppression</li>

                    <p><strong>Brain:</strong> Mental disturbance appearing as acute psychosis, meningitis-like symptoms and coma.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis of Malaria</h3>
                    <p>Diagnosis is made through:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Clinical diagnosis:</strong> is based on the patient's symptoms and on physical findings at examination. The first symptoms of malaria (most often fever, chills, sweats, headaches, muscle pains, nausea and vomiting) are often not specific and are also found in other diseases (such as the "flu" and common viral infections)</li>
                        <li><strong>Microscopic diagnosis:</strong> malarial parasites can be identified by examining under the microscope a drop of the patient's blood, spread out as a "blood smear" on a microscope slide</li>
                        <li><strong>Laboratory examination</strong> of thick and thin peripheral blood films/slides (smears) which demonstrate the parasites (Trophozoites)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management of Malaria</h3>
                    <p>The treatment of malaria depends on whether the disease is complicated malaria or uncomplicated malaria (severe malaria). Uncomplicated malaria is usually treated on an outpatient basis.</p>
                    <p>Refers to failure to achieve the desired therapeutic response after initiation of therapy. May result from: poor adherence to treatment; unusual pharmacokinetic properties in patient and drug resistance. Treatment failure should be suspected if the patient deteriorate clinically or if symptoms persist 3-14 days after initiation of drug therapy in accordance with recommended treatment regimen.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Re-appearance of symptoms 14 days after initiation of treatment should be considered as a new infection and be treated with 1st line treatment</li>
                        <li>In all suspected treatment failures, examination of well prepared thin and thick blood smears under light microscopy must be performed.</li>
                        <li>Confirmed cases of treatment failure should be treated with second line drugs</li>
                        <li>In cases where the cause of treatment failure is established to be non compliance, the same course of first line drugs may be used.</li>

                    <p>This is a disfiguring disease caused by a tiny worm (nematode) called wuchereria bancrofti.</p>
                    <p>It is mainly transmitted by mosquitoes; the culex quinquefasciatus found in heavily contaminated water especially in the urban areas and the culex pipiens and the anopheles mosquito in rural areas. These mosquitoes transmit the worm from person to person in the same way as malaria. The parasitic worm lives in the lymphatic system of the patient causing inflammation of the lymphatic vessels and lymph glands (lymphangitis, lymphadenitis), filarial fever, and eventually elephantiasis of the arms, legs and genitals. The disease is most frequent in the tropical coastal belts and the lake region.</p>
                    <p>Disease caused by filarial worms affecting lymphatic system. Also called Lymphatic Filariasis. Causal organism: Wuchereria bancrofti. It is one of the three parasitic worms, together with Brugia malayi and B. timori, that infect the lymphatic system to cause lymphatic filariasis. These filarial worms are spread by a variety of mosquito vector species</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                    <p>The microfilariae ingested by the feeding mosquito exsheath in the stomach and become first stage larva. They then penetrate the mosquito stomach wall and migrate to the thorax muscles where they moult twice and develop into the infective stage. Mature infective microfilariae migrate to the mouthparts of the mosquito. The extrinsic incubation period takes 10-12 days.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">LIFE CYCLE OF FILARIASIS</h3>
                    <p>W. bancrofti, is acquired via the bite of mosquitoes.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>When mosquitoes bite humans, they deposit third-stage infective larvae into the skin.</li>
                        <li>These larvae travel through the dermis and enter local lymphatic vessels. Over a period of approximately nine months, these larvae undergo a series of molts and develop into mature adult worms, which range from 2 to 5 cm in length. These adults reside in the lymphatics, generally several centimeters from lymph nodes.</li>
                        <li>They survive for approximately five years during which time male and females worms mate and produce microfilariae.</li>
                        <li>Female parasites can release more than 10,000 microfilariae per day into the bloodstream. These microfilariae are also known as embryonic or first-stage larvae.</li>
                        <li>Mosquitoes, which bite infected individuals, can take up these circulating microfilariae. Within the mosquito, these embryonic larvae develop into second then third stage larvae over a period of 10 to 14 days. The mosquito is then ready to bite and infect a new human host, thereby completing the life cycle</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                    <p>The presence of mature filarial worms in the lymphatic vessels triggers an inflammatory reaction in the walls of these vessels. When the worms die, more foreign proteins are released causing calcification of the lymphatic walls which eventually leads to obstruction of the flow of lymph fluid. If the obstruction of the lymph flow is extensive, chronic oedema develops in the affected areas of the body. Filariasis progresses through three stages.</p>

                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>This disease is commonly known as Bilharzia after Theodor Bilharz who discovered it in Cairo in 1861. The incidence of schistosomiasis is related to water use. Irrigation schemes or water projects for electricity provide the habitat for the snail vectors. Up to 75% of schistosomiasis is transmitted by infected humans while 25% is said to be transmitted by dogs, cows, rats, and baboons. In East Africa, there are two types of schistosomiasis, both of which are named after the causative parasite. They are schistosoma mansoni and schistosoma haematobium.</p>
                    <p>Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia or "snail fever", is a parasitic disease carried by fresh water snails infected with one of the five varieties of the parasite Schistosoma. Can contract it swimming in lakes, ponds and other bodies of water infested with the parasite's snail host.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Causative organisms</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>S. mansoni</li>
                        <li>S. haematobium</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Snail hosts</h4>
                    <p>The different species of Schistosoma have different types of snails serving as their intermediate hosts; these hosts are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Biomphalaria for S mansoni</li>
                        <li>Oncomelania for Sjaponicum</li>
                        <li>Bulinus for S haematobium and S intercalatum</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Risk factors</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contact with freshwater sources where infected snails carrying the disease live</li>
                        <li>Children under age 14</li>
                        <li>Individuals with labor or domestic chores centered around freshwater areas</li>
                        <li>swimming, bathing, fishing and even domestic chores such as laundry and herding livestock can put people at risk of contracting the disease.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                    <p>S. mansoni is spread in infected stool while S . haematobium is spread in infected urine. When the schistosome eggs in the urine enter a body of water such as a lake, dam, rice paddy or pond, they hatch into free-swimming larvae called miracidia. The intermediate host for S . mansoni is a vector snail of the genus biomphalaria pfeifferi; while for the S . haematobium it is bulinus africanus. The miracidia, after being shed from the ovum, must enter the appropriate snail host within 24 hours or die.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Transmission Cycle of Schistosomiasis</h4>
                    <p>Inside the body of the snail host, it takes the miracidia four to seven days to develop and multiply. The snail sheds them in water where they can only live for 48 hours unless they infect a human. A human being becomes infected when they enter cercariae-infested water, such as when bathing, swimming, laundering, cultivating or fishing.</p>

                    <p>The cercariae penetrate the skin and enter the bloodstream from where they are carried to the liver or bladder to develop into adult worms. Within four to six weeks, paired adults reach mesenteric and pelvic veins.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">LIFE CYCLE</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Parasite eggs are released into freshwater (from human urine, feces)</li>

                        <li>Cercarie are shed from the snail 4-7 weeks</li>
                        <li>They can live upto 48 hrs unless they infect human beings.Human become infected when they enter cercarie infected water while bathing,playing,laundering,cultivating or fishing.</li>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Disease development</h3>
                    <p>Schostosomiasis has several stages of development in the body. The development include Invasion,maturation,established infection and late stage</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Invasion:</strong> Cercarie penetrate into the skin.This causes cercarial dermatitis with itching papules and local edema. The cercarie then enter the circulation and reach the liver via right side of the heart and lungs</li>
                        <li><strong>Maturation:</strong> Schistosomes mature in the liver. The stage presents with:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fever</li>
                                <li>Eosinophilis</li>
                                <li>Abdominal pain</li>
                                <li>Transient generalised urticaria.It is also known as Katayana syndrome</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>After maturation, the adult worm descend into the portal vein. S.mansoni migrate to the mesentric veins in the intestinal wall and S.haematobium finds its way to the venous plexus of the bladder</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Established infection:</strong> Is the stage of egg production. Eggs are produced by female in small veins of the bowel or bladder. Some eggs penetrate tissues and other do not. They remain in blood and are carried to the liver and lungs. The eggs which do not reach lumen provoke inflammatory reaction and formation of granulomas. A granuloma is a small area of inflammation in tissue. These inflammatory reaction causes bloody diarrhoea and cramps in,S.mansoni and Terminal haematuria and dysuria in S.haematobium</li>
                        <li><strong>Late stage:</strong> Late stage is characterized by fibrosis and calcification which occur when there are many eggs in the tissues. Fibrosis refers to the thickening and scarring of connective tissue, usually as a result of injury. Calcification is the process in which calcium builds up in body tissue where there normally isn't any calcium. Over time, the buildup can harden and disrupt your body's normal processes.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">LATE STAGE IN THE BLADDER</h3>
                    <p>Late stage around the bladder results in:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Obstruction and dilatation of ureters and hydronephrosis possibly leading to kidney failure</li>
                        <li>Pyelonephritis</li>
                        <li>Calcification of the bladder which shows on x-ray or ultrasound investigation</li>

                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Late stage in the liver and lungs</h3>
                    <p>Late stage in the liver leads to: portal hypertension,splenomegaly, anemia,oesophegeal varices and massive bleeding. In the lungs,fibrosis leads to pulmonary hypertension which leads to congestive heart failure</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Acute and chronic infection</h3>
                    <p><strong>ACUTE INFECTION:</strong> Occur when Cercariae penetrate skin → rash called schistosome or swimmer's itch develop. Eggs laid in target organs release antigens which cause Katayama fever characterised by: Fever, Urticaria, Malaise, diarhea</p>
                    <p><strong>CHRONIC INFECTION:</strong> Symptoms of chronic infection caused by eggs that travel to various parts of body. Eggs remain trapped in host tissues → granulomatous inflammatory immune response. Granulomas: macrophages surrounded by lymphocytes. Fibrosis develops in the late stages</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">SYMPTOMS</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Symptoms for the disease vary depending on the type of worm involved and the location of the parasite inside the body</li>
                        <li>initial itching and rash at infection site ("swimmer's itch")</li>
                        <li>The classic sign of urogenital schistosomiasis is haematuria (blood in urine)</li>

                    <p>The diagnosis of schistosomiasis is confirmed by finding eggs in stools or urine during a microscopic examination. If this test is found to be negative, a colonic or urinary bladder biopsy can be done. Serological tests are also highly sensitive and yield specific results.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                    <p>The main aim of treatment is to kill the adult worms and to stop their egg-laying activity.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h3>
                    <p>The prevention of schistosomiasis can be achieved through the following measures:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prevention of ova-containing urine and stool from reaching the water by:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Digging and using pit latrines</li>
                                <li>Safe water supply</li>
                                <li>Treating the infected persons</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Attacking the intermediate host (the snail) using molluscicides such as copper sulphate which kills snails and their eggs.</li>
                        <li>Avoiding contact with infested water by using protective clothing when laundering, cultivating, swimming and wading. Bathing should be done at home (storing water at home for three days will kill the cercariae).</li>
                        <li>Conducting mass treatment campaigns for communities at risk using oral praziquantel, especially school-going children.</li>

                    <p>This is an infection caused by a parasite of the leishmania group. The disease is also known as Kala Azar. There are three forms of leishmaniasis which are caused by different parasites.</p>
                    <p>The vector of leishmaniasis is the female sandfly (phlebotomus). The four types of sand flies are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Phlebotomus martini</li>
                        <li>Phlebotomus orientalis</li>
                        <li>Phlebotomus longipes</li>
                        <li>Phlebotomus pedifer</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In Kenya, the main vectors are phlebotomus martini which transmit the parasite leishmania donovani, responsible for visceral leishmaniasis. The species P. orientalis is common in Sudan while P. longipes and P. pedifer are commonly found in Ethiopian and Kenyan highlands. Together they transmit the parasite leishmania aethiopica which is responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                    <p>The zoonotic hosts of leishmaniasis are mainly dogs and rodents, although in some parts of Kenya humans have become the reservoir as well as host. The parasites of leishmaniasis are transmitted when the sandfly bites an infected person and ingests amastigotes. On reaching the sandfly's stomach, the amastigotes change into promastigotes. After four to seven days, they migrate to the foregut where they develop into infective promastigotes. The infective promastigotes are then conveyed in the saliva of the sandfly during feeding. During feeding, the sandfly tears the host's tissue to feed on blood and at the same time deposits infective promastigotes at that site. From here the promastigotes enter the bloodstream and into the macrophages. On entering the macrophages, the parasites escape detection by the body's defences and are spread to various body tissues.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Visceral Leishmaniasis</h3>
                    <p>Visceral leishmaniasis is found in many areas of the North Eastern region of Kenya in Machakos, Kitui, Masinga, Tseikuru (Mwingi), Makueni, Kibwezi, and Wajir.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Features of Visceral Leishmaniasis</h4>
                    <p>Visceral leishmaniasis is characterised by fever, splenomegaliy, hepatomegally accompanied by anaemia and weight loss. Visceral leishmaniasis has a rather long incubation period of four to ten months or longer, before definitive signs and symptoms manifest. Most of the patients (96%) are killed by secondary bacterial infections of the lesions.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cutaneous Leishmaniasis</h3>
                    <p>Cutaneous leishmaniasis is found in West Pokot, Turkana, Baringo, Laikipia and Kerio valley. It is characterised by single or several painful chronic ulcers in those parts of the body exposed to sandfly bites, such as arms, legs or face. In the lower hotter areas of Kenya such as Baringo, the vector is the P. orientalis, while in the highlands of Kenya, the high altitude sandflies, P . longipes and P . pedifer are the vectors. Phlebotomus longipes bites human beings in their houses at night transmitting the parasite leishmania aethiopica, which is responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Picture of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis</h4>
                    <p>In about two to eight weeks following a bite from an infected sand fly, a small itchy papule appears at the site of the bite. Over several weeks, the papule grows in size expanding to form a single indolent ulcer or multiple ulcers. The disease may be mistaken for leprosy. There may be enlargement of the local lymph nodes. The lesions begin to heal spontaneously two to twelve months later. Cutaneous leishmaniasis does not spread to other body organs.</p>

                    </figure>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis</h4>
                    <p>Small lesions may be treated surgically by curettage or by freezing, using liquid carbon dioxide or by infiltrating them with 1 - 2 ml sodium stibogluconate. Large disfiguring or multiple skin lesions are treated in the same way as for visceral leishmaniasis using IV or IM sodium stibogluconate 20 mg/kg daily for 20-30 days. The drug of choice for visceral leishmaniasis caused by leishmania donovani is IM pentamidine isothianate 3 - 4 mg/kg once or twice a week.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis</h3>
                    <p>This form of leishmaniasis occurs primarily in the tropics of South America. The disease begins with the same sores noted in localised cutaneous leishmaniasis. Sometimes these primary lesions heal, other times they spread and become larger. Some years after the first lesion is noted (and sometimes several years after that lesion has totally healed), new lesions appear in the mouth and nose, and occasionally in the area between the genitalia and the anus (the perineum). These new lesions are particularly destructive and painful. They erode underlying tissue and cartilage, frequently eating through the septum (the cartilage which separates the two nostrils). If the lesions spread to the roof of the mouth and the larynx (the part of the wind pipe which contains the vocal cords), they may prevent speech. Other symptoms include fever, weight loss, anaemia (low red blood cell count). There is always a large danger of bacteria infecting the already open sores. Treatment is similar to that of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Prevention or early detection and appropriate treatment are preferred. Corrective surgery can be done where need arises.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h3>
                    <p>Kala Azar can be prevented through:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use of insecticide treated curtains in homes (these have been used with success in Baringo district)</li>
                        <li>Destruction of infected dogs and rodents</li>
                        <li>Early diagnosis and treatment of the infected persons</li>
                        <li>Health education for communities on preventive measures</li>
