                        <p><strong>Epidemiology:</strong> it is the study of occurrence, distribution and determinants of health and illness (or health related statuses) in a population and the application of this study in the control health problems.</p>
                        <p><strong>Prevalence:</strong> refers specifically to all current cases (old and new) existing at a given time in a given population. It can either be point prevalence and period prevalence.</p>
                        <p><strong>Point prevalence:</strong> it is the total number of cases (old and new) of a disease known to have existed at some point in time (a specific point).</p>
                        <p><strong>Period prevalence:</strong> it is the total number of cases of a disease known to have existed during a specified period e.g., Jan 2018- Dec 2018.</p>
                        <p><strong>Incidence:</strong> the number of new cases occurring in a defined population during a specified period of time.</p>
                        <p><strong>Epidemic:</strong> refers to the occurrence of a disease in a community or region in excess of normal expectancy.</p>
                        <p><strong>Endemic:</strong> the constant occurrence of a disease or infectious agent in a given geographical area or population group.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pandemic:</strong> an epidemic that usually affects a large proportion of the population occurring over a wide geographical area. It goes beyond boundaries.</p>
                        <p><strong>Host:</strong> a person or an animal that gives subsistence or harbors an infectious agent under natural conditions. The types of hosts include:</p>

                            <li>Transport hosts.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Susceptible host:</strong> a person or animal lacking sufficient resistance to a particular pathogenic agent to prevent disease if or when exposed.</p>
                        <p><strong>Agent:</strong> these are the organisms which are usually responsible for the occurrence of infections and infectious diseases. They include viruses, bacteria, fungi, helminthes, protozoa and anthropoids.</p>
                        <p><strong>Source:</strong> this is the site from which a pathogen is transmitted to a susceptible host either directly or indirectly through an intermediary object.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reservoir:</strong> the environment in which a pathogen lives and multiplies. Reservoirs include man, animals and non-living things.</p>
                        <p><strong>Environment:</strong> refers to extrinsic factors that affect the agent and the opportunity for exposure. Environmental factors include:</p>

                        <p>Epidemiology is divided into:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Descriptive epidemiology.</li>
                            <li>Analytical epidemiology.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Descriptive epidemiology</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Descriptive epidemiology uses existing data to compare how mortality or morbidity may vary among certain groups.</li>
                            <li>It describes the distribution of a disease in terms of place, person and time i.e. where, who and when.</li>
                            <li>Descriptive epidemiology is used in formulation of hypothesis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The essential characteristics of disease that we look for are as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Person:</strong> who is getting the disease? age, gender, ethnic group, genetic predisposition, diet, physical activity, smoking, concurrent disease, risk taking behaviour, education, SES, occupation etc</li>
                            <li><strong>Place (geographic):</strong> where are the rates of the disease highest or lowest? Presence of agents or vectors, climate, geology, population density, economic development, nutritional practices, medical practices.</li>
                            <li><strong>Time:</strong> when does the disease occur? Is the frequency of the disease now different from the corresponding frequency in the past? Calendar time, seasonality, time since an event, physiological cycles, age/time since birth, temporal trends.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">ANALYTICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is the branch of epidemiology that identifies aetiology or cause of disease, risk factors for disease causation and therefore the determinants of disease with the aim of developing preventive measures.</li>
                            <li>It is more focused on the determinants of disease.</li>
                            <li>It uses a comparison group to establish an association between risk factors and illness in the two groups.</li>
                            <li>It analyses the problem by testing the causes and determinants.</li>
                            <li>It is used in hypothesis testing.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following studies are useful in analytical epidemiology:</p>
                        <p><strong>A. Retrospective</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Looking back at previous morbidity or mortality of a disease.</li>
                            <li><strong>Case-control:</strong> compares the odds of past exposure to a suspected risk factor between cases. Cases refer to diseased individuals while controls refer to non-diseased people.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>B. Prospective studies</strong></p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Longitudinal:</strong> study of a population over a usually long period of time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cohort:</strong> a group of health people are identified and followed for a specified period of time. Exposed and unexposed participants are compared in relation to the diseases incidence.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cross-sectional studies:</strong> a sample of (or total) population is examined at a given point in time. Takes a snapshot of a cohort.</li>
                            <li><strong>Experimental:</strong> establishes cause and effect relationships through control of variables
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li><strong>Clinical trials</strong>......assignment</li>
                                    <li><strong>Field trials/community trials:</strong> they test or address preventive intervention. Subjects are allocated to receive the preventive measure or placebo. e.g vaccines to prevent polio...etc</li>
                                </ol>

                        <p>Epidemiology seeks to answer the following questions:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>What is the problem? Health related phenomena.</li>
                            <li>How big is the problem? How common is the health related phenomena.</li>
                            <li>Who has the problem? Sex, age, ethnic group etc</li>
                            <li>Where is the problem? Geographical place with the highest and lowest cases of the health related phenomena,</li>
                            <li>What causes the problem? Analytical epidemiology.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>Natural history of disease refers to the progression of a disease process in an individual over time, in the absence of treatment.</li>
                            <li>Most, diseases have a characteristic natural history, although the time frame and specific manifestations of disease may vary from individual to individual and are influenced by preventive and therapeutic measures.</li>
                            <li>The process begins with the appropriate exposure to infectious agents sufficient for the disease process to begin in a susceptible host.</li>
                            <li>After the disease process has been triggered, pathological changes then occur without the individual being aware of them. This stage is called the subclinical disease. It is the stage of disease unaccompanied by signs or symptoms and may only be detected by lab investigations.</li>
                            <li>It extends from the time of exposure to onset of disease symptoms.</li>
                            <li>It is usually called the incubation period for infectious diseases, and latency period for chronic diseases.</li>
                            <li>The onset of symptoms marks the transition from subclinical to clinical disease.</li>
                            <li>Clinical disease is disease accompanied by signs and symptoms. Most diagnoses are made during the stage of clinical disease.</li>
                            <li>In some people, however, the disease process may never progress to clinically apparent illness.</li>
                            <li>Such persons who are infectious but have subclinical disease are called carriers.</li>
                            <li>Ultimately, the disease process ends either in recovery, disability or death.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Disease prevention is defined as the postponement or removal of certain illnesses and conditions by use of interventions that have proved to be efficient.</li>
                            <li>The aim is to restore human health or to make the quality of life better.</li>
                            <li>Prevention is always done in three levels; primary, secondary and tertiary.</li>
                            <li>However, some epidemiologists usually talk about four levels where we have the primordial level right before the primary level.</li>
                            <li>The line between these levels of prevention may not be as clear as implicated in theory.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">PRIMORDIAL PREVENTION</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>At this level we try to do a lot of health promotion especially in campaigns to sensitize people to change behaviors or lifestyles that are considered dangerous.</li>
                            <li>The outstanding effect here is that we will no longer need other preventive interventions.</li>
                            <li>A good example may be that of promoting the use of no cholesterol food stuffs, food stuffs with added salt to prevent hypertension, another one may be the global campaign to eliminate smallpox so that we do not need the immunization anymore.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">PRIMARY PREVENTION</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Focuses on the prevention of disease before the biological onset, thus inhibits the development of disease.</li>
                            <li>For example getting measles immunization will prevent the clinical illness before it gets started.</li>
                            <li>Other types of primary prevention are focused on the behavioral aspects of individuals.</li>
                            <li>These would include quitting smoking, dental care by regularly brushing of teeth and maintaining a regular routine of exercise.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">SECONDARY PREVENTION</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>At this level we prevent the clinical illness through the early detection.</li>
                            <li>The individual has not started experiencing the symptoms associated with the disease.</li>
                            <li>Early detection is done through screening and from there we can manage or even reverse the outcome of the condition. Examples of interventions done for secondary prevention are routine cultures for sexually transmitted micro-organisms in the individuals who don't show the symptoms, screening for hypertension, screening for breast cancer or colon cancer.</li>
                            <li>Screening becomes useful especially when the disease in question is treatable.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">TERTIARY PREVENTION</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Focuses on stopping the disease from progressing further and inhibiting the development of new complications.</li>
                            <li>Mostly the physicians and other specialists who manage chronic conditions are involved.</li>
                            <li>Because of this, it creates a thin line between the definition of treatment and tertiary prevention.</li>
                            <li>We can have lowering of blood cholesterol after a heart attack to prevent the occurrence of further attacks and other complications like stroke and angina pectoris.</li>
                            <li>Another example would be examinations for retinal disease brought about by diabetes and then putting steps to prevent its progression.</li>

                            <li>Common frequency measures are ratios, proportions, and rates.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ratio</strong> is the expression of a relationship between a numerator and a denominator where the two are distinct and separate quantities. The numerator is not included in the denominator.</li>
                            <li><strong>Proportion</strong> is the comparison of a part to the whole. The numerator is included in the denominator e.g. what fraction of patients tested positive for HIV.</li>
                            <li>A proportion may be expressed as a decimal, a fraction, or a percentage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rate</strong> is a measure of the frequency with which an event occurs in a defined population over a specified period of time.</li>
                            <li>Usually, rate means how fast something is happening or going.</li>
                            <li>Rate is always reported per some unit of time.</li>
                            <li>For example, when we say 70 new cases of breast cancer per 1,000 women per year, the measure conveys a sense of the speed with which disease occurs in a population, and seems to imply that this pattern has occurred and will continue to occur for the foreseeable future. This rate is an incidence rate.</li>
                            <li>Other epidemiologists use the term rate more loosely, referring to proportions with case counts in the numerator and size of population in the denominator as rates.</li>
                            <li>For example, an attack rate is the proportion of the population that develops illness during an outbreak. For example, 20 of 130 persons developed diarrhea after attending a picnic. An alternative and more accurate phrase for attack rate is incidence proportion.</li>
                            <li>A prevalence rate is the proportion of the population that has a health condition at a point in time. For example, 70 influenza case-patients in March 2005 reported in County X.</li>
                            <li>A case-fatality rate is the proportion of persons with the disease who die from it. For example, one death due to meningitis reported among County X's population.</li>
                            <li>All of these measures are proportions, and none is expressed per units of time.</li>
                            <li>Therefore, these measures are not considered "true" rates by some, although use of the terminology is widespread.</li>
                            <li>Ideally, a rate is a proportion in which change over time is considered, but in practice, often used interchangeably with proportion, without reference to time.</li>
                            <li>Rates tell us how fast the disease is occurring in the population. Proportions tell us the fraction of the population affected.</li>
                            <li>Morbidity has been defined as any departure from a state of physiological or psychological well-being. In practice, morbidity encompasses disease, injury, and disability. Measures of morbidity include incidence and prevalence.</li>
                            <li>Mortality rate is a measure of the frequency of occurrence of death in a defined population during a specified interval. Morbidity and mortality measures are often the same mathematically; it's just a matter of what you choose to measure, illness or death.</li>

                        <p><strong>Clinical case-series:</strong> is a coherent and consecutive set of cases of a disease (or similar problem) derived from either the practice of health care professionals or a defined health care setting, e.g. a hospital.<br>
                        Unit of study: group of persons with a similar disease A case-series is, effectively, a register of cases.<br>
                        Analyse cases together to learn about the disease.<br>
                        Clinical case-series are of value in epidemiology for:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Studying symptoms and signs</li>

                        <p><strong>Case series: Population based</strong><br>
                        When a clinical case-series is complete for a defined geographical area for which the population is known, it is known as a population based caseseries consisting of a population register of cases.<br>
                        Epidemiologically the most important case-series are registers of serious diseases or deaths (usually NCDs), and of health service utilisation, e.g. hospital admissions.<br>
                        Usually compiled for administrative and legal reasons.</p>
                        <p><strong>Case series: Natural history and spectrum</strong><br>
                        By delving into the past circumstances of these patients, including examination of past medical records, and by continuing to observe them to death (and necropsy as appropriate), health professionals can build up a picture of the natural history of a disease.<br>
                        Population case-series is a systematic extension of this series but which includes additional cases, e.g. those dying without being seen by the clinicians.<br>
                        Add breadth to the understanding of the spectrum and natural history of disease.</p>
                        <p><strong>Case series: Requirements for interpretation</strong><br>
                        To make sense of case-series data the key requirements are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The diagnosis (case definition) or, for mortality, the cause of death</li>
                            <li>The date when the disease or death occurred (time)</li>
                            <li>The place where the person lived, worked etc (place)</li>
                            <li>The characteristics of the person (person)</li>
                            <li>The opportunity to collect additional data from medical records (possibly by electronic data linkage) or the person directly</li>
                            <li>The size and characteristics of the population at risk</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">ECOLOGICAL STUDIES</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These are studies where exposure data relating to a place (e.g. hardness of water, which could be collected on individuals) are correlated with health data collected on individuals but summarized by place (e.g. Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) rates).</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Simple to conduct</p>
                        <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Individual link between exposure and effect cannot be made (ecologic fallacy)</p>
                        <p><strong>Ecological fallacy example</strong><br>
                        Imagine a study of the rate of coronary heart disease in the capital cities of the world relating the rate to average income. Within the cities studied, coronary heart disease is higher in the richer cities than in the poorer ones. We might predict from such a finding that being rich increases your risk of heart disease. In the industrialised world the opposite is the case within cities such as London, Washington and Stockholm, poor people have higher CHD rates than rich ones. The ecological fallacy is usually interpreted as a major weakness of ecological analyses. Ecological analyses, however, informs us about forces which act on whole populations.</p>

                        Helps to compare variations in disease pattern within and between countries. Variations in disease distribution can be classified as :</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>International variation</li>
                            <li>National variation</li>
                            <li>Rural - urban variation</li>
                            <li>Local distribution</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Describe a health event by place to gain insight into the geographical extent of the problem. Analyzing data by place- get an idea of where the agent that causes a disease normally lives and multiplies, what may carry or transmit it, and how it spreads. If the occurrence of a disease is associated with a place, we can infer that factors that increase the risk of the disease are present either in the persons living there (host factors) or in the environment, or both.</p>

                        <p><strong>C. Person distribution</strong><br>
                        Analysis of data by "person" has several person categories.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inherent characteristics of people (e.g. age, race, sex),</li>
                            <li>Their acquired characteristics (immune or marital status),</li>
                            <li>Their activities (occupation, leisure activities, use of medications/tobacco/drugs), or</li>
                            <li>The conditions under which they live (socioeconomic status, access to medical care).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Step 4: Measurement of disease</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rates and ratios are used to measure death, disease and disability patterns.</li>
                            <li>Research designs are used to obtain estimates of the magnitude of health and disease in populations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The research designs are :</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Cross - sectional study designs:</strong> there is a single examination of a cross section of the population at one point in time (snap shot). The results are then generalized to the whole population</li>
                            <li><strong>Longitudinal study designs:</strong> the observations are repeated in the same population over a prolonged period of time by means of follow - up examinations</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These categories determine who is at greatest risk of experiencing undesirable health condition. Age is important since almost every health-related event or state varies with age.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Factors that vary with age are : susceptibility, opportunity for exposure, incubation period of the disease, and Physiologic response (which affects, among other things, disease development).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Sex.</strong> males have higher rates of illness and death than females do for a wide range of diseases. This sex-related difference is because of genetic, hormonal, anatomic, or other inherent differences between the sexes. These inherent differences affect their susceptibility or physiologic responses. For example, premenopausal women have a lower risk of heart disease than men of the same age. This difference is attributed to higher estrogen levels in women.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Step 5: Comparing with known indices.</h4>
                        <p>To arrive at clues to causative factors of disease, comparison is made between different populations and sub groups of the same population</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Step 6: Formulation of etiological hypothesis</h4>
                        <p>Hypothesis can be formulated related to the disease etiology. A hypothesis is a supposition which is arrived from observations or reflections. Criteria for formulating hypothesis should include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Population</li>
                            <li>Specific cause</li>
                            <li>Expected outcome</li>
                            <li>The amount of cause to effect</li>
                            <li>Time period between the exposures to cause the effect</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> to uncover the source and mode of spread of disease. Used to determine the multiple factors that caused the disease as agent, host and environment. It focuses on the determinants for the relatively high or low frequency of disease in specific groups.

                        <ul>
                            <li>It is first approach to testing causal hypothesis, especially for rare disease</li>
                            <li>Compares cases and controls with the regard to the presence of some elements in their past experiences.</li>
                            <li>A group of people who are diagnosed to be having a particular health problem (cases) are compared with a group of people who are free from that particular problem (control) from a chosen population</li>

                        <p>The investigator intervenes and changes on variable and then observes what happens in the other. It allows for control of variables, random allocation of subjects and elimination of bias on part of the experiment. Are used to confirm aetiological hypothesis and to evaluate or assess the effectiveness of the therapeutic preventive measures before applying them to the community. Interventional or experimental study involves attempting to change a variable in subjects under study. This could mean the elimination of a dietary factor thought to cause allergy, or testing a new treatment on a selected group of patients. The effects of an intervention are measured by comparing the outcome in the experimental group with that in a control group.</p>

                        <p>In epidemiology, there are two types of experimental studies:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Prophylactic or clinical trials (RCT)</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Designed to prevent disease or conditions in which the efficacy of preventive of therapeutic agent or procedure is tested on individual subjects e.g. administration of BCG vaccine as prophylaxis for TB</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Therapeutic or community trials</strong> -
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Designed to treat established disease processes in which a group of individuals as a whole is used to determine the efficacy of a drug or procedure</li>
                                    <li>e.g. the evaluation of fluorides in preventing dental carries</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Though similar to cohort in approach, experimental studies are carried out under the direct control of the investigator. The study requires the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Intervention or action</strong> - is application or withdrawal of suspected case or changing variable in the causative chain in experimental group</li>
                            <li><strong>Observation</strong> - observe changes occurring in the variable in the experimental group</li>
                            <li><strong>Comparison</strong> - compare the findings of experimental group with the control group</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>Randomized Control Trials (RCT)</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>RCT is a planned experiment designed to asses the efficacy of an intervention in human beings by comparing the effect of intervention in a study group to a control group.</li>
                            <li>The allocation of subjects to study or control is determined purely by chance (randomization).</li>
                            <li>For new programme or new therapy RCT is best method of evaluation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Randomized controlled trial (RCT)</strong> - involves the process of random allocation of the subjects to be studied.</li>
                            <li>Randomization is done to eliminate bias and allow for comparison.</li>
                            <li>The investigator has no control over the grouping of participants under study or control group.</li>
                            <li>It is done after the participants have given consent and have qualified the criteria of the clinical trial</li>

                        <p><strong>Field trials</strong></p>

                            <li>Field trials, in contrast to clinical trials, involve people who are healthy but presumed to be at risk.</li>
                            <li>Data collection takes place "in the field," usually among non-institutionalized people in the general population.</li>
                            <li>Since the subjects are disease-free and the purpose is to prevent diseases.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>Community Trials /therapeutic trials</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In this form of experiment, the treatment groups are communities rather than individuals.</li>
                            <li>It is designed to treat established disease process in which a group of individuals as a whole is used to determine the efficacy of a drug or procedure</li>
                            <li>This is particularly appropriate for diseases that are influenced by social conditions, and for which prevention efforts target group behaviour.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>Examples of community trials</strong></p>
