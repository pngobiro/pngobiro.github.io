                        <li>This disease is caused by Ascaris lumbricoides, which infects the small intestine.</li>
                        <li>Ascaris is a large intestinal parasite which often infects children because of their habit of putting all kinds of things in their mouth.</li>
                        <li>It is one of the commonest and most widespread infections of the small intestine.</li>
                        <li>The worms may multiply in large numbers in the intestinal lumen and cause intestinal obstruction at the ileocaecal valve.</li>
                        <li>The worms also contribute to severe malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency, and may wander out of the intestinal lumen into the peritoneal cavity.</li>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">MODE OF TRANSMISSION</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ascariasis is a soil transmitted parasite. Once the eggs are passed out in faeces, they require embryonation in the soil before they can become infective.</li>
                        <li>This takes 8-50 days. Embryonated eggs can be carried away from the contaminated place into houses by feet, footwear or in dust by the wind.</li>
                        <li>Human beings may injest the eggs as they eat or drink using contaminated hands and utensils, or through eating raw contaminated foods like fruit. Once the eggs are ingested by a human being they hatch into worms</li>
                        <li>Once the eggs are ingested by a human being they hatch into worms.</li>
                        <li>In order to reach maturity, the larvae need to pass through the lungs and trachea to the pharynx. Once in the pharynx they are swallowed and return to the gastrointestinal tract where they can live for about a year.</li>
                    </ul>

                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>Trypanosomiasis is a tropical disease caused by protozoa called Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (Tbg) and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (Tbr). The important reservoir of Tbr in the wild is the bushbuck. Trypanosomiasis affects both humans and cattle and is invariably fatal over varying periods of time if not treated. Trypanosoma brucei gambiense causes an acute, rapidly progressive illness with death from cardiac complications within several weeks or months. Reservoirs include antelope and pigs. Tb is found in eastern Africa, now mostly in south-east Uganda. Trypanasomiasis spreads very rapidly unless the source (the very first case) is identified early, isolated and treated properly. Trypanasomiasis is found in the same areas in Africa where yellow fever is found.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                    <p>Trypanosomiasis is transmitted by tsetse flies which live in areas of wooded vegetation. Tsetse flies are usually not found in flat plains, closely cultivated areas or areas densely inhabited by people.</p>
                    <p>There are two important types of tsetse flies known to transmit the disease to humans.</p>
                    <p>There is glossina palpalis, a riverine type which breeds along rivers and lakes, and glossina morsitans the woodland type which lives away from water. glossina palpalis is the main vector of <b>Tb gambiense</b>, while glossina morsitans is the main vector for Tb rhodesiense and it prefers to bite cattle and game but will also bite humans. Of the two types of tsetse flies, glossina palpalis (which transmit Tb gambiense parasite) is the main vector in East Africa. Tsetse flies become infected with sleeping sickness parasites when they take a blood meal from infected persons or animals. After a period of time, during which the trypanosomes undergo development changes, the fly is able to transmit the infection when it bites another susceptible animal or person.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The Disease Transmission Cycle of Trypanosomiasis</h4>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_08_23_d0e184c182a9e2ef9f23g-025-1.jpg" alt="A diagram illustrating the life cycle of Trypanosomiasis, showing the transmission between tsetse flies and human hosts." class="content-image">
                    </figure>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                    <p>There is considerable variation in the clinical picture of African trypanosomiasis (AT). Within a few days of a tsetse bite, fever develops due to the invasion of the blood stream by the trypanosomes. The incubation period between the tsetse bite and the onset of fever varies from as short as a few hours following the chancre to several weeks.</p>
                    <p>The early stages of trypanosomiasis are characterised by irregular episodes of fever with headaches, malaise, weight loss, muscle and joint pains, pruritus, anaemia, skin rash, and deep hyperaesthesia (Karandel's sign).</p>
                    <p>The clinical features of trypanosomiasis depend on the infecting parasite as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (Tbg)</b> infection causes a slow chronic sleeping sickness, resulting in death from the disease in several months or years. Pigs, dogs and antelopes are the reservoirs.</li>
                        <li><b>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (Tbr)</b> infection is acute and rapidly progressive unless prompt treatment is administered. The parasites damage the heart causing cardiac complications and death within several weeks or months. Pigs and antelopes are the reservoirs for Tb rhodesiense.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Trypanosomiasis presents in the following three stages:</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1. Primary Stage (chancre stage)</h4>
                    <p>Within a few days of the tsetse bite, a painful indurated erythematous nodule may appear at the site of the bite.</p>
                    <p>This chancre may last for one to two weeks and then resolve spontaneously. The chancre occurs in 70% of cases in Europeans but is rare in Africans.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2. Blood Stage (systemic illness)</h4>
                    <p>During this stage, the trypanosomes spread to the blood, lymph and lymph nodes. There is fever, which does not follow any typical pattern but recurs at intervals of days or weeks. After the fever resolves, the patient develops anaemia, debilitation and general body weakness. The spleen becomes enlarged as well as the lymph nodes. The cervical lymph nodes especially of the lower back of neck become visibly enlarged in 80% of patients - this is called Winterbottom's sign. The other signs and symptoms of trypanosomiasis include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pruritic rash (beginning six to eight weeks after infection)</li>
                        <li>Hepatosplenomegaly</li>
                        <li>Poor appetite resulting in weight loss, debility, pitting oedema of face and lower legs</li>
                        <li>Impotence and menstrual irregularities</li>
                        <li>Heart failure</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3. Cerebral Stage (Sleeping sickness stage)</h4>
                    <p>This is the terminal stage of trypanosomiasis. During this stage of the disease, the parasites invade the brain leading to mental deterioration and coma. Convulsions and localised signs such as hemiplegia and facial palsy may occur. Patients are very weak, they sleep during the day but are restless at night. As the disease progresses, the patients become severely ill and die if not treated.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Microscopic examination of the chancre fluid to demonstrate the trypanosomes</li>
                        <li>Examination of blood (buffy coat) for trypanosomes</li>
                        <li>Wet blood smear for microscopy</li>
                        <li>Thick blood smear for microscopy</li>

                    <p>Yellow fever is an acute viral disease transmitted to human being by the aedes aegypti mosquito.</p>
                    <p>Yellow fever can spread rapidly, and case fatality rate may reach as high as 30% in non-immune populations. Yellow fever is a disease of forest monkeys (zoonoses) and is transmitted among them by the aedes africanus mosquito.</p>
                    <p>Humans may be bitten outside the forest by mosquitoes which have acquired the disease from monkeys feeding on bananas and other agricultural plantations. In urban areas, yellow fever is transmitted by the aedes aegypti.</p>
                    <p>Yellow fever is a disease of tropical African countries, especially in the rain forests.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yellow fever is an acute viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes.</li>
                        <li>It is caused by yellow fever virus</li>
                        <li>The "yellow" in the name refers to the jaundice that affects some patients.</li>
                        <li>It is characterised by sudden onset of fever, rigors, headache, jaundice, muscle pain, nausea and vomiting.</li>
                        <li>It is a zoonotic disease of forest monkeys</li>
                        <li>It is transmitted by a mosquito vector called Aedes aegypty</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">PATHOGENESIS</h3>
                    <p>After transmission of the YF virus from a mosquito the viruses replicate in the lymph nodes. They then reach the liver and infect hepatocytes, wc leads to eosinophilic degradation of these cells. When the disease takes a deadly course, there's cardiovascular shock and multi organ failure with strongly increased cytokine levels (cytokine storm) follow.</p>
                    <p>Yellow fever begins after an incubation period of 3 - 6 days. Most cases only cause a mild infection with fever, headache, chills, back pain, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. In these cases the infection lasts only three to four days.</p>
                    <p>In 15% of cases, sufferers enter a second, toxic phase of the disease with recurring fever accompanied by jaundice due to liver damage, and abdominal pain. Bleeding in the mouth, the eyes, and the gastrointestinal tract will cause vomitus containing blood (i.e. black vomit).</p>
                    <p>The toxic phase is fatal in approximately 20% of cases. In severe cases the mortality may exceed 50%.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                    <p>The mosquito becomes infected after feeding on the blood of an infected monkey or person on the third day of fever.</p>
                    <p>The incubation period takes 18 days at a daily temperature of 18°C and four days at 37°C. The cycle takes four days and once infected, the mosquito remains infected and infective for its entire life (about two to four months).</p>
                    <p>A person may also become infected with yellow fever through handling of blood from an infected individual in the first three days of the disease or handling infected monkeys in the early stages of viraemia.</p>
                    <p>Laboratory staff may become infected when working on infected monkeys or infected mosquitoes.</p>
                    
                    <p>Yellow fever virus has three transmission cycles: jungle (sylvatic), intermediate (savannah), and urban.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <b>jungle (sylvatic) cycle</b> involves transmission of the virus between non-human primates (e.g., monkeys) and mosquito species found in the forest canopy. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes from monkeys to humans when humans are visiting or working in the jungle.</li>
                        <li>In Africa, an <b>intermediate (savannah) cycle</b> exists that involves transmission of virus from mosquitoes to humans living or working in jungle border areas. In this cycle, the virus can be transmitted from monkey to human or from human to human via mosquitoes.</li>
                        <li>The <b>urban cycle</b> involves transmission of the virus between humans and urban mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti. The virus is usually brought to the urban setting by a viremic human who was infected in the jungle or savannah</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Picture</h3>
                    <p>The onset is sudden with the following signs and symptoms:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fever</li>
                        <li>Headache</li>
                        <li>Backache</li>
                        <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A bleeding tendency (epistaxis, bleeding gums, haematemesis, malaena)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Liver cell necrosis (in severe illness) resulting in jaundice</li>
                        <li>Nephritis leading to albuminuria which may proceed to anuria and renal failure</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once contracted, the yellow fever virus incubates in the body for 3 to 6 days.</p>
                    <p>The most common Symptoms are fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. In most cases, symptoms disappear after 3 to 4 days.</p>
                    <p>A small percentage of patients, however, enter a second, more toxic phase within 24 hours of recovering from initial symptoms</p>
                    <p>High fever returns and several body systems are affected, usually the liver and the kidneys. In this phase people ar develop and abdominal pain with vomiting.</p>
                    <p>Bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach. Half of the patients who enter the toxic phase die within 7-10 days.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">DIAGNOSIS</h3>
                    <p>A presumptive diagnosis of yellow fever is often based on the patient's clinical features, places and dates of travel (if the patient is from a non-endemic country or area), activities, and epidemiologic history of the location where the presumed infection occurred</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Laboratory diagnosis of yellow fever is generally accomplished by testing of serum to detect virusspecific IgM and neutralizing antibodies. Sometimes the virus can be found in blood samples taken early in the illness.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Viral hepatitis</li>
                        <li>Malaria</li>
                        <li>Leptospirosis</li>
                        <li>Relapsing fever</li>
                        <li>ebola</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                    <p>Yellow fever like most other viral haemorrhagic diseases has no specific drug for treatment.</p>
                    <p>You only give supportive treatment and ensure that the patient is nursed in strict isolation using ordinary barrier nursing techniques.</p>
                    <p>You also ensure that the patient has no further contact with the mosquitoes through the use of insecticide treated bed nets and ensuring that the room is well screened. This is to prevent further spread of the disease from the patient to other healthy people.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">TREATMENT</h3>
                    <p>Treatment is directed at symptomatic relief or lifesaving interventions. Rest, fluids, and use of analgesics and antipyretics may relieve symptoms of fever and aching</p>
                    <p>There is currently no specific anti-viral drug for yellow fever but specific care to treat dehydration, liver and kidney failure, and fever improves outcomes. Associated bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Administering yellow fever vaccine to all travellers coming from or going to yellow fever endemic areas.</li>
                        <li>Spraying aircraft coming in from yellow fever endemic areas with insecticides to kill imported mosquitoes, which may be infected.</li>
                        <li>Isolating all persons who have been in contact with the infected persons. Such individuals should be quarantined in screened houses for seven days.</li>

                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>This is a highly infectious disease caused by bacteria called yersinia pestis.</p>
                    <p>Plague is a disease of rodents, especially rats and is spread from rat to rat by a rat flea called xenopsylla cheopis.</p>
                    <p>Plague is a very rare but serious disease because it can spread very rapidly unless the first case is recognised early and appropriate action taken.</p>
                    <p>It is also a serious disease with a high mortality rate (case fatality rate in the absence of treatment can be as high as 60% ).</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                    <p>Plague occurs when infected wild rats, especially the sewer rat (R. norvegicus) die from the disease and their fleas look for substitute domestic rat (rattus italia) hosts. The domestic rat becomes infected and after it dies the fleas start biting human beings. When the first human is infected, the disease causes bubonic plague. People working in the fields may also be bitten by fleas from the dead infected wild rats and develop bubonic plague.</p>

                    </figure>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Picture</h3>
                    <p>Plague has three clinical presentations, bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                    <p>The diagnosis of plague can be confirmed by doing a microscopy (staining) of sputum or pus from the bubo to demonstrate the bacilli.</p>
                    
                    <aside class="callout warning" role="alert">
                        <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span> Remember</h4>
                        <p>Early recognition of plague followed by correct action is a matter of life or death.</p>
                    </aside>

                    <p>You must start treatment as soon as you confirm the diagnosis from clinical and laboratory findings. The plague bacillus (Yersinia pestis) is sensitive to most common antibiotics except penicillin. Drug treatment with any of the following antibiotics is effective:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>IM streptomycin 30 mg/kg two to four times daily for ten days</li>
                        <li>Oral or IV tetracycline 10 mg/kg six hourly for ten days</li>
                        <li>Oral cotrimoxazole two tabs twelve hourly for seven days</li>
                        <li>Oral chloramphenicol 500 mg six hourly for seven days</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Nb: Plague is an internationally notifiable disease.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management, Prevention and Control</h3>
                    <p>The prevention and control of plague depends on the following measures:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Early diagnosis and notification so that the patients are not moved or referred to the hospital</li>
                        <li>Chemoprophylaxis of all contacts of the patients such as family, visitors and health care workers using tetracycline or cotrimoxazole</li>
                        <li>Isolation of the infected and quarantine of the contacts for ten days</li>
                        <li>Use of insecticides to kill fleas</li>
                        <li>Eradication of rats, for example using rat poison</li>
                        <li>Vaccination during epidemics using an anti-plague vaccine</li>
                        <li>Health education for communities on preventive measures</li>

                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>This is an acute infectious bacterial disease which is characterised by alternating febrile periods. It is also known as Recurrent fever, Spirillum, Tick fever, or Tick Bite fever. It is transmitted by ticks and lice.</p>
                    
                    <p>There are two types of relapsing fever, namely:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Louse-borne relapsing fever</li>

                    </ol>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                    <p>The disease is transmitted from person to person by the bite of the head louse, body louse or soft tick.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Louse-borne</h4>
                    <p>The louse-borne relapsing fever is spread by the human head louse, pediculus capitis, and the body louse, pediculus corporis. They transmit spirochaetes of the genus borrelia reccurentis.</p>
                    <p>The human louse transmits louse-borne relapsing fever from person to person. When the louse feeds on the blood of an infected person, it takes up the bacteria.</p>
                    <p>The bacteria multiply within the body of the louse (but these spirochaete are not found in the saliva or the excreta of the louse).</p>
                    <p>The infection is transmitted to another person only when the louse is crushed on the body surface near a bite wound.</p>
                    <p>The offspring of an infected louse does not carry the spirochaetes. Epidemics of louse-borne relapsing fever are associated with times of war and famine when refugees are crowded together in unsanitary conditions, which promote infestation with human body lice.</p>
                    <p>Body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus) is a vector for Rickettsia prowazekii, Bartonella quintana and Borrelia recurrentis wc cause louseborne relapsing fever (more severe than the tickborne variety).</p>
                    <p>It is currently prevalent in Ethiopia and Sudan.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Tick-borne</h4>
                    <p>The tick-borne relapsing fever is transmitted by soft ticks (ornithodoros moubata) which live in cracks and crevices of walls and floors.</p>
                    <p>They transmit spirochaetes of the genus borrelia duttoni, which cause tick-borne relapsing fever. Children, visitors and pregnant women travelling to endemic areas are more susceptible to the disease. Adults in endemic areas are semi-immune to relapsing fever.</p>
                    <p>Tick-borne relapsing fever is transmitted when a tick sucks blood from an infected person. The spirochaetes are taken up and multiply in the tick's body. In seven days, the spirochaetes appear in the tick's salivary glands and the coxal fluid ready to be transmitted to a new host. The organisms can either be injected directly when the tick feeds on the host, or they can infect a new host by penetrating intact mucous membranes (for example in laboratory infections).</p>
                    <p>Unlike in louse-borne fever where the offspring does not carry the organism, in tick-borne fever the borrelia duttoni organisms pass into the ovary of the tick, thus automatically infecting the offspring of the ticks (vertical transmission). In this way, a house once inhabited by infected ticks will remain dangerous for up to ten years.</p>
                    <p>In an infected pregnant woman, the spirochaete can cross the placenta to the foetus resulting either in abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery, or congenital infection in the newborn.</p>
                    <p>Tick-borne relapsing fever is found primarily in Africa, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Asia in and certain areas of Canada and the western United States.</p>
                    <p>Borrelia hermsii, Borrelia parkeri and Borrelia duttoni are transmitted by the soft-bodied African tick Ornithodoros moubata, is responsible for the relapsing fever found in central, eastern and southern Africa. Rodents act as reservoir hosts.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                    <p>The patient presents with sudden onset of fever which ranges between 39.5°C - 40.5°C. There is rapid pulse, headache, aching joints, vomiting and infected conjunctiva. Often there is potential rash, epistaxis, and herpes labialis. After five to seven days, the temperature drops by crisis. In about 60% of the patients, a less severe relapse of the symptoms occurs five to ten days after the first attack. A second relapse may occur in about 25% of the patients. In untreated cases, there may be up to ten relapses. The fever and Clinical symptoms become less severe each time after the relapse. Relapsing fever has a high mortality rate of 40%. Common complications of relapsing fever include meningitis, iritis, optic nerve atrophy (blindness), myocarditis and liver failure bleeding.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                    <p>You can confirm relapsing fever by doing a microscopic examination of a thick blood smear for the spirochaetes.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                    <p>Treatment should eradicate the spirochaete from the body without eliciting Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.</p>
                    <p>Some deaths occur after starting treatment as a result of a severe Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. The antibiotics suddenly kill a large number of spirochaetes which release toxins into the circulation causing the patient to collapse.</p>
                    <p>This reaction is characterised by chills, rapid breathing, elevated temperature (40-42°C), confusion, delirium, and sometimes convulsions and coma. The patient then develops very severe hypotension, and may go into heart failure. This complication is however not seen in tick-borne infections. Patients must be nursed flat, given adequate fluids and be confined to bed for at least 24 hours.</p>
                    <p>The treatment of relapsing fever is IM procaine penicillin 400,000 units stat, followed the next day by oral tetracycline <b>500mg</b> six hourly for five to seven days. An alternative to tetracycline is oral doxycyline 200 mg once (single dose).</p>

                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>Onchocerciasis is a chronic disease caused by a filarial worm called onchocerca volvulus.</p>
                    <p>It lives in the subcutaneous and connective tissue of the infected person. It manifests mainly as skin nodules on bony surfaces, and causes eye lesions which result in blindness.</p>
                    <p>That is why it is also known as river blindness.</p>
                    <p>The vector for <b>O. volvulus</b> is the female black fly of the genus simulium. In western African countries where the disease is more prevalent, the vector is simulium damnosum, while in East Africa the vector is simulium neavei.</p>
                    <p>The disease is found in western Uganda, southern Sudan, and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Blackflies are able to travel up to 80 km in a day.</p>
                    <p>The simulium fly breeds in fast running well aerated rivers or turbulent areas of a river such as at the waterfalls and rapids.</p>
                    <p>The eggs of the simulium fly are able to develop into larvae only in water that is rich in oxygen, such as fast flowing rivers. Larvae are attached to submerged plants, rocks and living crabs.</p>
                    <p>The female O. volvulus worm is only about 0.3 mm in diameter but can be as long as half a meter (50 cm) long. The male is about 0.2 mm in diameter and 4 -13 cm long.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                    <p>River blindness is spread from person to person by the bite of an infected blackfly. Black flies feed during the day both inside and outside houses.</p>
                    <p>They usually bite early in the morning or late in the evening.</p>
                    <p>The blackfly takes up microfilariae when it sucks the blood of an infected person.</p>
                    <p>Once in the stomach, the microfilariae penetrate the stomach wall and travel to the thoracic muscles where they develop further for about seven days.</p>
                    <p>They then move to the head of the fly ready to be transmitted to the next susceptible person when the fly feeds.</p>
                    <p>When the fly bites again, it injects the larvae of O. volvulus into the skin of the healthy host. The larvae mature in the human subcutaneous tissue into adult worms in about one to three years.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">LIFE CYCLE</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Humans become infected when blackfly bites and deposit Onchocerca infective larvae into the skin.</li>
                        <li>Once inside the human body, the larvae mature into adults in around 3 months to 1 year.</li>
                        <li>The mature males and females then collect in balls, bound together by fibrous tissue which forms the typical nodule. The nodules are best seen on bony skin surfaces like elbow,shoulder scapula,skull,ribs and iliac crest</li>
                        <li>Most adult female worms live in fibrous nodules under the skin and sometimes near muscles and joints</li>
                        <li>If a blackfly bites an infected person, onchocerciasis larvae can be ingested by the blackfly after whichThey migrate to the biting parts of the fly where they can be transmitted back to humans when it bites again.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                    <p>After the adult O. volvulus has lived in the body of an infected person for about one year, it begins to give birth to microfilariae. One adult female worm can produce up to one million microfilariae every year. The microfilariae of O.volvulus have a strong liking for the skin and eyes of the infected host. Adult worms live up to 17 years in nodules in the subcutaneous and connective tissue. Most nodules are found on the bony skin surface such as the elbow, skull, ribs, iliac, crests, and shoulder scapula.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">THE DISEASE HAS FOUR DIFFERENT CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS:</h4>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1. Severe Itching</h4>
                    <p>This is one of the early symptoms and mainly affects the buttocks. The severe itching is often accompanied by skin depigmentation giving rise to a 'leopard skin'.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2. Skin Nodules</h4>
                    <p>These are caused by the adult worms which you saw earlier like to live in the skin. They contain adult worms and are painless, rubbery, and firm; ranging in diameter from 3 mm - 3 cm. Are caused by adult worms.Are firm and non tender ranging from 3 mm to 3 cm in diameter.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3. dermatitis</h4>
                    <p>This is caused by a reaction to the presence of microfilariae in the epidermis and manifests as itchy papules and macules. Later, the skin becomes loose, scaly, atrophic and depigmented. Caused by presence of microfilariae in epidermis and manifests as itchy papules or macules.Later the skin become loose,scaly,atrophic and depigmented</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">4. blindness</h4>
                    <p>This is caused by the presence of microfilariae in the cornea and the anterior chamber of the eye. It starts with oedema of conjunctiva; then corneal spots and a pannus begin to develop. Finally cataracts, iritis, sclerosing keratitis, and glaucoma develop leading to blindness. You can differentiate between trachoma and river blindness because in river blindness the pannus start at the lower limbus, while in trachoma it affects the upper limbus.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                    <p>The diagnosis is made by examining skin snips from the thighs, buttocks and iliac crests under a microscope for microfilariae.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The most common method of laboratory diagnosis used to identify microfilariae is a biopsy of the skin called a skin snip. Microfilariae emerge when the skin snip is placed in a saline solution.</li>
                        <li>Nodules can also be surgically removed to identify adult worms</li>
                        <li>A physical examination of the patient can detect localized dermatitis or subcutaneous nodules</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>NB: Onchocerca volvulus is not found in the blood therefore it cannot be used for diagnosis</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">MANAGEMENT</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First line treatment is ivermectin 150 µg/Kg orally either yearly or bi-annually.</li>
                        <li>Ivermectin kills circulating microfilariae as well as those that are stillin adult female worms; this reduces the numbers of microfilariae in the skin and the production of new microfilariae by adult worms so the disease does not progress</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Contra-indicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding women.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Six weeks course of doxycycline</li>
                        <li>Diethylcarbamazine {Hetrazan or Banocide</li>
                        <li>Kills microfilariae though it has no effect on adult worm</li>
                        <li>Surgical excision when nodules are located in the heade</li>
                        <li>MAIN GOAL OF THERAPY: to prevent deelopment of irreversible lesions and alleviate symptoms</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">TREATMENT</h3>
                    <p>Onchocerciasis is not a fatal disease. If the patient has no serious complaints and is likely to be re-infected, there is no urgency for treatment, since the traditional drugs used have been known to cause severe reactions. However, the following groups of patients do need treatment:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Patient with eye lesions</li>
                        <li>Patients with severe skin lesions</li>
                        <li>Patients with heavy infections</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Two types of treatment are used in the management of this disease.</p>
                    <p>i) The first one is to kill the microfilariae. Give the patient oral Ivermectine (mectizan) 150 microgram/kg single dose repeated once every six to twelve months.</p>
                    <p>ii) The second type of treatment is aimed at killing or removing the adult worms by surgical resection of the nodules.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h3>
                    <p>The following measures have been found to be useful in preventing onchocerciasis:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Addition of insecticide to the water of rivers known to be breeding places of the simulium fly</li>
                        <li>Wearing of long clothing which covers most of the body</li>
                        <li>Moving the whole community away from sites near where black flies breed</li>
                        <li>Treating infected people with microfilaricides</li>
                        <li>Mass treatment of communities using ivermectine</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">SUMMARY</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Onchocerciasis, commonly known as "river blindness", is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus.</li>
                        <li>It is transmitted to humans through exposure to repeated bites of infected blackflies of the genus Simulium.</li>
                        <li>Symptoms include severe itching, disfiguring skin conditions and visual impairment, including permanent blindness</li>
                        <li>Community-directed treatment with ivermectin is the core strategy to eliminate onchocerciasis in Africa. In the Americas the strategy is biannual large-scale treatment with ivermectin</li>
