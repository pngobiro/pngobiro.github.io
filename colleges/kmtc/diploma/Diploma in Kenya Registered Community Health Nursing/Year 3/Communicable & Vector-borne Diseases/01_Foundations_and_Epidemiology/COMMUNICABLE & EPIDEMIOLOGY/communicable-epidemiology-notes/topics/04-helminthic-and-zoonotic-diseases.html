                    <span class="heading-text">LEPROSY (HANSEN'S DISEASE)</span>
                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>Leprosy is one of the oldest diseases of human beings. It is caused by a bacteria belonging to the same family as the mycobacterium that causes tuberculosis, known as mycobacterium leprae. Leprosy is a major public health and socio-economic problem because it is a disabling and deforming disease. Leprosy is not a killer disease in that it runs a chronic course and does not significantly reduce the life expectancy of the infected individual. In some communities patients suffering from leprosy are discriminated against or stigmatised due to ignorance and unfounded traditional beliefs. This causes a lot of distress and misery to those infected and their families. In Kenya, leprosy has almost been eradicated except for a few endemic areas in the Coast, Eastern, Nyanza and Western Province.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                    <p>Leprosy has a long incubation period and runs a chronic course if it is not adequately treated at an early stage. The mycobacterium leprae bacillus multiplies very slowly (dividing only once every 14-30 days). That is why the incubation period is long, about five to eight years. Just like tuberculosis, the leprosy bacillus is transmitted by droplets, by sneezing, coughing, spitting and unhygienic nose cleaning habits. The organism is also suspected to enter the body through broken skin such as small wounds. Leprosy is common among family members of the infected.</p>
                    <p>There are certain factors that increase the incidence of leprosy in the community:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Presence of many untreated cases</li>
                        <li>Overcrowding in living houses</li>
                        <li>Presence of susceptible new comers in a leprosy endemic area</li>
                        <li>Hiding patient with leprosy and starting treatment late</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Classification (Types) of Leprosy</h3>
                    <p>Broadly speaking, there are two forms of leprosy:</p>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Tuberculoid form</li>
                        <li>Lepromatous form.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pauci-Bacillary Leprosy (PBL), also called tuberculoid leprosy is characterised by:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Absence or presence of very few of bacilli in the skin smears or skin biopsy (skin smear is negative)</li>
                        <li>Skin patches 1-5cm</li>
                        <li>Reaction type I</li>
                        <li>Nerve involvement/damages affects one or more peripheral nerves</li>
                        <li>Disability and deformities are common as a result of irreversible nerve damage and most are disfiguring</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Multi-Bacillary Leprosy (MBL), also called lepromatous leprosy, is characterised by:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Presence of numerous bacilli in most tissues of the body, except brain and spinal cord</li>
                        <li>Skin patches six or more cm</li>
                        <li>Skin smears positive (numerous bacilli present)</li>
                        <li>Reaction both type I and type II</li>
                        <li>Nerve damage comes late</li>
                        <li>Disability and deformities usually develop at a later stage of the disease</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nerve Involvement in Leprosy</h3>
                    <p>The main cause of disability in leprosy is the destruction of the nerves. Damage to the sensory nerve fibres causes anaesthesia, while damage to the motor nerve fibres causes paralysis. Impaired circulation, loss of sweating and skin atrophy is caused by damage to autonomic nerve fibres. Leprosy patients may get burned or injured on their limbs and fail to notice because of anaesthesia. The patient may walk on an injured foot without realising it. In the eye, the cornea may become anaesthetic so that foreign bodies may enter unnoticed leading to corneal damage. Anaesthetic eyelids may lose the blinking reflex or fail to close the eye (lagophthalmos) leading to dryness, iritis, adhesions, glaucoma and blindness.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                    <p>After infection, the mycobacterium leprae bacilli multiply in macrophages of the skin and the schwann cells of the peripheral nerve fibres. The bacillus has a preference for the relatively cool places in the body such as the face and the limbs.</p>
                    <p>The early signs of leprosy are as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hypopigmented patches on the skin with loss of sensation to pain, touch and temperature</li>
                        <li>Loss of sweating or loss of hair over the affected part</li>
                        <li>Burning sensations in the skin</li>
                        <li>Weakness of eyelids, hands or feet</li>
                        <li>Thickening of cutaneous nerves especially the ulnar, median and lateral popliteal nerves</li>
                        <li>Nodules in the skin especially of the nose, face and ears</li>
                        <li>Painless wounds (ulcers) and burns on the hands and feet</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Reaction Types</h3>
                    <p>Reactions are sudden unexpected changes which occur in all types of patients with leprosy. These reactions are caused by a change in the balance between the immunity of a patient and the bacilli. There are two main types of reactions, type I or reversal reaction and type II or erythema nodusum leprosum.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Type I Reaction (Reversal Action)</h4>
                    <p>Type I reaction (reversal action) is common in PauciBacillary Leprosy (PBL). It occurs after a sudden increase in immunity results in a rapidly increased response of the body to the leprosy bacilli. This reaction causes sudden inflammation in places where the leprosy bacilli are present. It causes nerve damage, inflamed and raised red skin lesions and oedema of hands, face or feet.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Type II Reaction (Erythema Nodosum Leprosum)</h4>
                    <p>This appears six months or more after treatment and is caused by a reaction between dead leprosy bacilli and circulating antibodies. Nerve damage is not common in this reaction. Eyes, joints and testes become inflamed, nerve become tender and ulcerating tender nodules appear on the skin. Thus, reaction is usually of sudden onset and tends to recur. Generally, reactions in leprosy are provoked by a number of factors. These include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Malaria, malnutrition, anaemia</li>
                        <li>Severe emotional or physical stress</li>
                        <li>Menstruation, pregnancy, abortion, puberty and childbirth</li>
                        <li>Using drugs containing iodine</li>
                        <li>BCG vaccination</li>
                        <li>Osteomyelitis</li>
                        <li>Septic wounds</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                        <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span> Remember:</h4>
                        <p>Drugs for leprosy do not cause reactions and therefore should not be stopped.</p>
                    </aside>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Late Deformities of Leprosy</h3>
                    <p>The following are the late deformities of leprosy:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Paralytic deformities including claw hand, claw fingers, wrist drop, food drop, claw toes, lagophthalmia, corneal ulcers, and facial paralysis</li>
                        <li>Depression of the nasal bridge</li>
                        <li>Wrinkling of facial skin</li>
                        <li>Disfigured ears</li>
                        <li>Stiffness of finger joints</li>
                        <li>Shortening and loss of fingers and toes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                    <p>The diagnosis of leprosy can be made using the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clinical signs: presence of pigmented anaesthetic patches on skin and thickened nerves</li>
                        <li>Bacteriological examination: skin slit and skin crap, nasal smears for leprosy bacilli</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                    <p>The aim of leprosy treatment is to prevent nerve damage, deformity, blindness and defaulting. The National Leprosy and Tuberculosis Programme (NLTP) in Kenya uses the WHO recommended multiple drug therapy for the treatment of the two classes of leprosy.</p>

                    <p>Having looked at drug therapy you will now find out what else can be done to prevent blindness and deformity.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Wound Prevention in Leprosy</h4>
                    <p>Wounds are caused and made worse by the loss of sensation to pain, pressure or burning. Therefore to prevent further damage you should advise the patient to do the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wear protective footwear</li>
                        <li>Wear heatproof gloves when working and handling hot objects</li>
                        <li>Inspect the feet and legs regularly for swelling, cracks, bruises, injuries, dryness - a small mirror can be used to inspect the soles of feet</li>
                        <li>Soak feet for 20 minutes twice daily in salty water, then rub oil on the skin to keep it moist and prevent cracks</li>
                        <li>Remove grit from inside the shoes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Eye Care</h4>
                    <p>For the patients who are suffering from lagophthalmos, you should advise them as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wear sun glasses</li>
                        <li>Check the eye daily in front of a mirror for inflammation and foreign bodies</li>
                        <li>Cover the eyes with pads at night</li>
                        <li>Avoid rubbing the insensitive eyes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Exercises</h4>
                    <p>It is common knowledge that joints which are not used become stiff, while muscles atrophy and become weak. Also scar tissue tends to retract resulting in contractures. That is why all patients with weak or damaged hands should do suitable exercises. For paralysed muscles, passive exercises help to loosen the stiff joints and lengthen the skin. The exercises should be done for five to ten minutes daily on a regular basis.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h3>
                    <p>The cornerstone of leprosy control is to reduce the number of infective cases and interrupt transmission. These can be achieved through the following preventive measures:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Treatment of all infective cases until cured</li>
                        <li>Searching for unknown cases, registering and treating them</li>
                        <li>Administration of BCG vaccine which gives some immunity against leprosy</li>
                    </ul>

                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>Helminthic diseases are still a very common problem in Kenya, despite the fact that it is known how to prevent and treat them. They are common in low income areas such as slum settlements due to lack of proper facilities for human waste disposal as well as poor attitudes.</p>
                    <p>The other factors which promote the spread of some helminths are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Moist warm soil in the case of hookworms</li>
                        <li>Cattle keeping areas in the case of tapeworms</li>
                        <li>Lack of latrines in the case of roundworms</li>
                        <li>Unwashed hands in the case of threadworm</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Helminthic diseases can be categorised into two groups:</p>

                    <p>This group is made up of cylinder-shaped worms and includes</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Threadworms/Pinworm</li>

                        <li>Roundworms</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">THREADWORM/PINWORM</h4>
                    <p>The threadworm is caused by enterobius vermicularis. It has a worldwide distribution and mainly affects school aged children, especially in boarding schools. The children reinfect themselves when they scratch their anus and then transfer the eggs on their fingers to the mouth.</p>

                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_08_23_d0e184c182a9e2ef9f23g-037-1.jpg" alt="Illustration of the life cycle of the pinworm, Enterobius vermicularis, showing auto-infection." class="content-image">
                    </figure>
                    
                    <h5>Mode of Transmission</h5>
                    <p>Infection with enterobius vermicularis is maintained by direct transfer of infective eggs from the anus to the mouth (auto infection) or indirect contact through clothing, bedding, food and other articles. After ingestion, the eggs hatch in the stomach and small intestine. The worms mature in the lower small intestine and upper colon and then they migrate to the rectum where they discharge eggs on the perianal skin, especially during the night. This causes itching and consequently scratching. The graphic illustrates the life cycle of the pinworm.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Clinical Features</h5>
                    <p>List four clinical features of pinworm infestation. Your list should include the following signs and symptoms of pinworm infestation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mainly pruritus ani leading to intense scratching of the perianal region</li>
                        <li>Disturbed sleep</li>
                        <li>Restlessness</li>
                        <li>Loss of appetite and weight loss</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Diagnosis</h5>
                    <p>Diagnosis is mainly made by a laboratory examination of stool microscopy for ova and cyst.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Management</h5>
                    <p>You should treat the whole family with mebendazole 100 mg given as a single dose. During treatment you should impress on the patient the importance of avoiding auto-infection.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Prevention and Control</h5>
                    <p>The prevention and control of this disease lies in improved personal hygiene and proper disposal of faeces. You should give health education on the importance of bathing and hand washing, keeping nails short, and how to prevent reinfection.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">WHIPWORM</h4>
                    <p>This infestation is called trichuriasis because it is caused by an intestinal worm called Trichuris trichiura. The worm infects the large intestine and infestation is usually asymptomatic.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Mode of Transmission</h5>
                    <p>The transmission of trichuriasis is indirect, as the eggs passed in the faeces require embryonation in soil. Therefore unlike the threadworm, auto-infection is not possible. When the embryonated eggs are ingested, they hatch and eventually the mature worms attach themselves to the mucosa of caecum and colon. They are mainly transmitted through food that is contaminated by soil or dirty fingers.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Clinical Features</h5>
                    <p>Often, mild infections are asymptomatic, but heavy infections may result in abdominal discomfort, bloody diarrhoea, loss of weight and prolapse of rectum.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Diagnosis</h5>
                    <p>Diagnosis is made by examining a stool sample microscopically for ova and cyst.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Management</h5>
                    <p>You can eliminate this infection by giving oral mebendazole 100 mg 12 hourly for three days.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Prevention and Control</h5>
                    <p>Just like the threadworm, the prevention of trichuriasis can be achieved through good personal hygiene and proper disposal of faeces.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">ROUNDWORM (ASCARIASIS)</h4>
                    <p>This disease is caused by Ascaris lumbricoides, which infects the small intestine. Ascaris is a large intestinal parasite which often infects children because of their habit of putting all kinds of things in their mouth. It is one of the commonest and most widespread infections of the small intestine. The worms may multiply in large numbers in the intestinal lumen and cause intestinal obstruction at the ileocaecal valve. The worms also contribute to severe malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency, and may wander out of the intestinal lumen into the peritoneal cavity.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Mode of Transmission</h5>
                    <p>Ascariasis is a soil transmitted parasite. Once the eggs are passed out in faeces, they require embryonation in the soil before they can become infective. This takes 8-50 days. Embryonated eggs can be carried away from the contaminated place into houses by feet, footwear or in dust by the wind. Human beings may injest the eggs as they eat or drink using contaminated hands and utensils, orthrough eating raw contaminated foods like fruit. Once the eggs are ingested by a human being they hatch into worms. In order to reach maturity, the larvae need to pass through the lungs and trachea to the pharynx. Once in the pharynx they are swallowed and return to the gastrointestinal tract where they can live for about a year.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_08_23_d0e184c182a9e2ef9f23g-038-1.jpg" alt="The life cycle of Ascaris lumbricoides." class="content-image">
                    </figure>
                    
                    <h5>Clinical Features</h5>
                    <p>Infection with a few ascaris is usually asymptomatic and if symptoms are present, they are not characteristic. There may be vague abdominal discomfort or occasionally the worm may leave the body in vomitus or stool. Also during the stage of larval migration through the lungs there may be temporary symptoms of pneumonitis (cough).</p>
                    
                    <h5>Diagnosis</h5>
                    <p>Diagnosis is by stool microscopy which should show ascaris ova and cyst.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Management</h5>
                    <p>Any one of the following drug treatments is useful in the management of ascariasis.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Oral mebendazole 100 mg 12 hourly for three days</li>
                        <li>Oral levamisole (3 tabs or 5 mg/kg body wt) single dose</li>
                        <li>Oral piperazine 150 mg/kg body wt single dose</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Note: For intestinal obstruction, surgical operation is indicated.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Prevention and Control</h5>
                    <p>The prevention and control of ascariasis involves the following measures:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improved environmental sanitation such as proper excreta disposal, clean supply of water</li>
                        <li>Discouraging the use of raw (fresh) human faeces for manure (Composting for six months kills the ascaris eggs)</li>
                        <li>Washing of fruit and vegetables before eating</li>
                        <li>Use of drying racks for utensils so that they do not come into contact with soil and dust</li>
                        <li>Washing hands after opening bowels</li>
                        <li>Washing hands before handling food</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">HOOKWORM (ANCYLOSTOMIASIS)</h4>
                    <p>This is an infection of the small intestine by a bloodsucking worm called Ancylostoma duodenale or necator americanus. In East Africa, necator americanus is the cause of the disease. The worm causes severe iron deficiency anaemia and protein loss. Each adult necator americanus worm causes a daily loss of 0.03 ml of blood from the patient. In many infected individuals the disease is asymptomatic because the hookworm load is light.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Mode of Transmission</h5>
                    <p>Hookworm eggs are embryonated by the time they are passed out with faeces. Indeed, when the faeces stand for a long time before examination the free larvae can be found. When an infected person passes faeces in the soil, the larvae bury themselves in the moist damp soil. The larvae are called rhabditiform and only become infective after five days, when they change into the sheathed filariform stage.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_08_23_d0e184c182a9e2ef9f23g-039-1.jpg" alt="Illustration of hookworm larvae." class="content-image">
                    </figure>
                    <p>As soon as the filariform larvae come into contact with a human leg or foot, they penetrate actively through the skin and reach the lungs via the venous system and the right side of the heart. Once in the lungs they penetrate the alveoli and are carried to the larynx and pharynx, from here they are swallowed into the stomach. When they reach the stomach they attach themselves to the wall of the abdomen with hook-like teeth and start to suck blood from the patient's body.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_08_23_d0e184c182a9e2ef9f23g-039-2.jpg" alt="Life cycle of the hookworm, showing skin penetration, migration to the lungs, and maturation in the intestine." class="content-image">
                    </figure>
                    <p>In most of the cases, hookworm infestation tends to be asymptomatic. However the following signs and symptoms are indicative of hookworm infestation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Itching of the skin at the site of entry (local irritation)</li>
                        <li>Anaemia (due to haemorrhage), pallor</li>
                        <li>Weakness, puffy face, malnutrition</li>
                        <li>Flatulence, constipation</li>
                        <li>Pain in abdomen</li>
                        <li>Some little blood in stool</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h5>Diagnosis</h5>
                    <p>Diagnosis of hookworm infestation is made by stool microscopy which should show ova and cysts and in some cases occult blood. More than 100 eggs in an ordinary faecal smear indicate heavy infection.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Management</h5>
                    <p>The following drugs are commonly used in the treatment of hookworm infections:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Levamisole 25 mg/kg body weight as a single dose</li>
                        <li>Mebendazole 100 mg bd. for three days</li>
                        <li>Albendazole 400 mg stat</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">FLATWORMS</h3>
                    <p>This group is made up of flat or segmented worms, their intermediate hosts are mainly animals, such as cattle, pigs and dogs. You will look at two worm diseases under this group, namely</p>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Tapeworms</li>
                        <li>hydatidosis</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">TAPEWORM (TAENIASIS)</h4>
                    <p>There are various types of tapeworms, but in human beings the infestations are commonly caused by:</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Taenia saginata or beef tapeworm (commonest infection)</li>
                        <li>Taenia solium or pork tapeworm</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>You will now consider each type in turn.</p>

                    <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">TAENIA SAGINATA OR BEEF TAPEWORM</h5>
                    <p>Infection with the beef tapeworm is common in areas where beef is eaten raw or lightly cooked.</p>
                    
                    <h6>Mode of Transmission</h6>
                    <p>The eggs of adult tapeworms living in the small intestines of human beings are passed in the stools. They are then ingested by cows as they feed on contaminated grass. Once in the gastrointestinal tract of the cow, the embryos hatch and penetrate the bowel wall and are carried via the bloodstream to striated muscles. Here the larvae grow and form infective cysts called cysticerci. When human beings ingest cow meat containing these cysts, the cysts are dissolved by the gastric acid in the stomach to release embryos.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_08_23_d0e184c182a9e2ef9f23g-040-1.jpg" alt="Life cycle of Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm), showing the transmission between cattle and humans." class="content-image">
                    </figure>
                    
                    <h6>Clinical Features</h6>
                    <p>Most tapeworm infections caused by taenia saginata do not cause any signs or symptoms. However, some people may complain of loss of weight, abdominal discomfort and itching around the anus (pruritis ani).</p>
                    
                    <h6>Diagnosis</h6>
                    <p>Diagnosis of tapeworm infestation can be made by the presence in the stool of segments or eggs. The eggs are not laid singly and appear only accidentally in the stools.</p>
                    
                    <h6>Management</h6>
                    <p>Drug treatment with oral niclosamide is effective. The dose is 1 gm chewed and swallowed with water followed one hour later with 1 gm (a total of 2 gm ).</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">TAENIA SOLIUM (PORK TAPEWORM)</h5>
                    <p>This disease occurs when a person ingests pork infected with the taenia solium larvae. Whereas in the beef tapeworm the embryo attaches itself to the wall of the small bowel and grows into an adult worm, the pork tapeworm behaves differently. The embryo penetrates the intestinal wall of the human as it does the pig, and it is carried to organs like striated muscle or the brain. This can cause serious problems such as epilepsy and death.</p>
                    
                    <h6>Clinical Features</h6>
                    <p>Taenia solium is a dangerous worm and the signs and symptoms depend on the organ it has invaded as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the brain it causes epilepsy</li>
                        <li>In the skeletal muscles it causes myositis (severe pain), which may make movement temporarily impossible</li>
                        <li>In the laryngeal muscles it causes difficulty in speaking</li>
                        <li>In the myocardium it causes (myocarditis), heart failure or cardiac arrest</li>
                        <li>In the eyeball it can cause unilateral or bilateral blindness</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h6>Diagnosis</h6>
                    <p>Diagnosis of taenia solium infections can be made by doing the following tests:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Biopsy examination of the infected tissue</li>
                        <li>X-ray examination to locate the calcified cysticercus</li>
                        <li>Stool microscopy for ova and cyst</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h6>Management</h6>
                    <p>The management involves both the surgical removal of calcified cysticercus where possible as well as drug treatment with niclosamide 2 gm . The dose is 1 gm chewed and washed down with water followed one hour later by 1 gm . What measures would you recommend for the prevention and control of taeniasis?</p>
                    <p>The prevention and control of taeniasis can be achieved through the following simple measures:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Proper disposal of human faeces in toilets instead of in the field and within reach of cattle and pigs</li>
                        <li>Ensuring that beef, pork and fish are thoroughly cooked</li>
                        <li>Eating only meats that have been inspected</li>
                        <li>Burying in deep pits or incinerating the carcases of heavily infected cattle and pigs</li>
                        <li>Washing hands thoroughly after handling carcases and raw meat</li>
                        <li>Early diagnosis and treatment of infected persons</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">HYDATIDOSIS (HYDATID DISEASE)</h4>
                    <p>The hydatidosis disease is actually a disease of dogs (zoonotic). Human beings become infected only by accident. Nevertheless, the disease is a serious problem among the Turkana community of northern Kenya.It is also known as echinococcosis or hyddtid disease.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Mode of Transmission</h5>
                    <p>Hydatidosis is caused by the cysts of the dog tapeworm known as Echinococcus granulosis. Dogs and other carnivores such as jackals and lions are the hosts of the dog tapeworm. The eggs are passed in the faeces of an infected dog and ingested by domesticated animals such as sheep, goats, cattle, camels, donkeys, and wild antelopes. The eggs hatch in the animal's intestine and penetrate through the intestinal wall to the portal circulation. They are then carried to the liver and lungs where they form many cysts. When a dog eats the diseased animal it becomes infected with these cysts, which then proceed to develop into mature worms. Human beings become infected when they accidentally ingest eggs from dog faeces. The larvae migrate from the intestine to the liver or lungs causing cysts. The larvae can also cause cysts in other tissue in the body.</p>

                    </figure>

                    <h5>Clinical Features</h5>
                    <p>In the liver, the cyst grows slowly over time thereby enlarging the liver. The abdomen may also become grossly distended.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Diagnosis</h5>
                    <p>This is done through a chest x-ray or an abdominal ultrasound investigation. A serological test can also be done to assist in making the diagnosis.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Management</h5>
                    <p>The treatment of hydatid disease can either be medical or surgical.</p>
                    <p>The medical treatment is as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Oral albendazole 20 mg/kg in divided doses twice daily for 30 days (The cure rate with this treatment is 20%). The treatment can arrest the growth of the cyst and reduce its size</li>
                        <li>PAIR (Puncture, Aspiration, Instillation of 95% alcohol and Re-aspiration). This is the treatment for the liver or spleen. The ultrasound machine is used to guide the PAIR procedure. This treatment is very effective and has a high cure rate</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The surgical treatment is known as endocystectomy. It is the surgical removal of the cysts contents, especially those cysts that are easily accessible like abdominal cysts.</p>

                    <h5>Prevention and Control</h5>
                    <p>The prevention and control of the hydatid disease can be achieved by eradicating stray dogs and deworming them. Deworming should be done every six weeks with praziquantel. You should also provide health education on the dangers of close contact with dogs (licking), especially among children. Also, infected meat should not be fed to dogs.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diseases from Contact with Animals</h3>
                    <p>Diseases that are transmitted between infected vertebrate animals (animals with a backbone) and humans are called zoonotic. In some of these diseases, humans are usually the last in the transmission cycle or the final host as in the case of hydatidosis, unless of course the person's body is eaten by a predator. Similarly in other diseases like rabies and brucellosis, the disease transmission ends with mankind, though possibilities of further transmission can occur if for example, a rabid patient bites another person, or a patient with brucellosis accidentally transmits it to another person. Zoonoses are transmitted between animals and humans through the following means:</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Vectors</h4>
                    <p>These include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The rat flea which transmits plague among rats and other rodents</li>
                        <li>The tsetse fly which transmits trypanosomiasis among game animals and nagana in cattle</li>
                        <li>Mosquitoes which transmits yellow fever among monkeys</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Ingestion of Contaminated Material</h4>
                    <p>Ingestion of meat or dairy products from sick animals, leading to diseases such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Anthrax (meat from cattle and game animals)</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Animal Bites</h4>

                    <p>In this section you will cover anthrax, rabies and brucellosis, looking at their mode of transmission, clinical picture, diagnosis, management and prevention.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">ANTHRAX</h3>
                    <p>Anthrax is an acute bacterial disease of herbivores (plant eating animals). However, it occasionally also infects human beings especially those who process hides, skins and wool or work in slaughterhouses. Anthrax is caused by a rod shaped bacteria (bacilli) called bacillus anthracis. The disease can occur in large numbers among cattle (epizootic), especially during drought and flooding when they are moved from one place to another. In humans, this infection takes various forms depending on the route of entry. There is anthrax of the skin which affects people who handle cattle, anthrax of the lungs which occurs in people working with infected wool; and anthrax of the bowels which affects families who eat the meat of dead animals. The type of disease caused depends on the route of entry of the bacillus or its spores. In animals, anthrax causes a fever which is followed by septicaemia and death. Vultures, which feed on the dead animal can spread the spores.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h4>
                    <p>The bacillus anthracis forms spores when exposed to the air. The spores can survive for years in the soil even under harsh weather conditions. The spores enter the animals orally (through the mouth or ingestion). The body of a sick or dead animal contains millions of anthrax bacilli. These bacilli are shed through animal urine, droppings, saliva milk and blood. If any of these body fluids are touched or the meat of an infected animal eaten, a person becomes infected with anthrax.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Features</h4>
                    <p>The clinical features depend on the route of entry of the anthrax bacillus. Skin or cutaneous anthrax presents with a malignant pustule with a black necrotic centre. The wound is usually painless and has swollen edges. Skin anthrax has low mortality. Respiratory tract anthrax on the other hand has a high mortality rate and presents with severe respiratory distress and shock. Digestive tract anthrax is characterised by fever, sepsis, watery diarrhoea and vomiting.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Diagnosis</h4>
                    <p>The diagnosis of anthrax is made by taking a specimen (fluid from vesicles, sputum or stool) for a culture to confirm gram-positive rods.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                    <p>Bacillus anthracis responds to penicillin and most other antibiotics. Patients with anthrax of the respiratory tract need respiratory support and oxygen therapy in a high dependence care unit. Those with anthrax of the digestive tract may need fluid replacement due to diarrhoea and vomiting.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h4>
                    <p>Although the main responsibility for the prevention and control of anthrax falls on the veterinary department, you as a health worker also have a role to play. You should ensure that all meat offered for sale is inspected and educate the community on proper disposal of all infected animals. The carcasses must be burnt or buried two meters deep in the ground in calcium oxide powder (quick lime). Other measures include annual vaccination of cows at risk, proper disinfection of hides and skins, and vaccination of members of the community who are at risk of getting anthrax.</p>
                    <p><strong>Infectious Agent:</strong> Bacterium Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis), an aerobic, Gram-positive, encapsulated, spore forming, nonmotile rod.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clinical Presentation:</strong> Depending on the route of transmission of infection, there are four clinical syndromes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cutaneous Anthrax:</strong> Characterized by initial itching of exposed skin, an initial vesicle at the site of inoculation develops into a painless black eschar; fever, malaise and headache may be present.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inhalational Anthrax:</strong> The most lethal form of disease. Initial presentation includes, sweats, malaise, mild cough, dyspnea, nausea or vomiting, and this is followed by acute onset of respiratory distress and shock; there is also radiological evidence of mediastinal widening and pleural effusion present. Fatality rate is extremely high.</li>
                        <li><strong>Anthrax meningitis:</strong> Begins with hypotension, quickly followed by delirium or coma; refractory seizures, cranial nerve palsies, and myoclonus have been reported.</li>
                        <li><strong>Intestinal Anthrax:</strong> Presents with acute vomiting, abdominal distension, gastrointestinal bleeding, and peritonitis. Symptoms of oropharyngeal Anthrax include fever, neck swelling due to lymphadenopathy, throat pain, oral ulcers and sepsis.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">RABIES</h3>
                    <p>Rabies is a serious viral disease of canines which is incidentally transmitted to humans by the bite of a rabid animal. It is caused by a virus known as lassa virus type I. The disease is of public health importance because it has a case fatality rate of 100%. If a patient is not treated immediately after the bite, once the clinical signs appear it is too late. Rabies is found all over the world and in canines. It occurs all the time and in great numbers (enzootic and epizootic). In human beings, rabies is a zoonotic disease, and humans usually do not transmit it any further. The main reservoirs of lassa virus type I are felines, hyenas, and mongoose.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h4>
                    <p>The rabies virus is transmitted to humans through the saliva of an infected animal such as a dog or cat. This happens when humans get bitten by a rabid animal or when its saliva comes into contact with the mucous membranes or open wound of a person. The main reservoirs of the disease are wild animals such as mongooses, jackals and hyenas. These wild animals infect domestic animals including cattle, donkeys and horses, which in turn infect mankind. In North and South America, rabid bats have been known to infect humans. All warm blooded animals are susceptible to rabies.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Features</h4>
                    <p>The incubation period of rabies ranges from two weeks to a year, with an average of two to three months. The length of the incubation period is influenced by the following factors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The size of the bite - the deeper the bite the shorter the incubation period</li>
                        <li>Distance of the wound from the brain - the nearer the wound is to the brain the shorter the incubation period</li>
                        <li>Type of wound - if the wound is big with extensive tissue damage the shorter the incubation period</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The earliest symptoms usually consist of increasingly severe pain in the bite wound, depression, irritability, nausea, sore throat, headache and loss of appetite. Later, two clinical presentations emerge:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Furious rabies</strong> whereby the infected person develops convulsions, intense fear of death and irrational excitement, which alternates with periods of alertness and calmness. The patient is also unable to tolerate noise, bright light and cold drought (aerophobia - fear of cold air). There is increased reflexes, muscle spasms, excessive sweating, dilatation of pupils, excessive salivation and lacrimation. The patient develops intense hydrophobia (fear of water) because of the intense pain experienced when swallowing water due to spasms of the pharyngeal muscles. This stage is also known as the 'furious' rabies stage and it lasts for two to three days and sometimes for five to six days. Death usually occurs due to cardiac or respiratory failure during a convulsion.</li>
                        <li>The next stage is the <strong>paralytic rabies stage</strong> which is characterised by paralysis of muscles causing paraplegia, quadriplegia and coma. Patients who reach this stage do not survive for more than a week.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</h4>
                    <p>Following inoculation, it begins to replicate in the skin or muscle tissue before it works its way into the peripheral nerves. It then spreads to the CNS in the endoneurium of the Schwann cells. Terminally, there is widespread CNS involvement and the patient presents with paralysis then to death</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Diagnosis</h4>
                    <p>Diagnosis of rabies is made if a person is bitten by a dog with abnormal behaviour and without any provocation. In addition the presence of negli bodies in the brain of a suspected animal should confirm the disease.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                    <p>There is no cure for rabies once the disease has started. It is however possible to prevent it from reaching that stage by doing the following:</p>
                    
                    <h5>Post Bite Prophylaxis</h5>
                    <p>Immediately someone is bitten you should give first aid treatment of the bite with the aim of removing as much virus as possible. This involves immediate flushing of the wounds and scratches preferably with running water and washing the surrounding skin with a lot of soap and water. Puncture wounds should be irrigated with a sterile catheter using methylated spirit and povidone. lodine is also virucidal and may be used to clean the wound. Bite wounds should not be sutured immediately to prevent more traumas from the suturing needle, which will increase the areas for viral entry into the body tissue. Suturing may be done 24 to 48 hours after the bite using very few sutures under the cover of anti-rabies serum locally.</p>
                    
                    <h5>ANTI-RABIES VACCINE</h5>
                    <p>This is a very safe and effective treatment following a rabid animal bite. The vaccine HDCV (Human Diploid cells tissue Culture Vaccine) is administered in six doses IM as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 ml immediately after exposure (day 0), 1 ml on day 3, 1 ml on day 7, 1 ml on day 14, 1 ml on day 28, 1 ml on day 90.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Other Drugs</h5>
                    <p>In order to prevent wound infection and tetanus you should give the patient broad spectrum antibiotics.</p>
                    <p>Note: The animal, which inflicted the bite, should be quarantine and observed for ten days from the day of the bite. If it shows signs of rabies it should be killed anditshead removed and sent under refrigeration for rabies examination.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vaccinate dogs and cats against rabies as required by law. All dogs and cats more than four months of age must be vaccinated against rabies.</li>
                        <li>Keep dogs and cats under control. Animal control laws prohibit allowing animals to roam unsupervised</li>
                        <li>Immediately wash the wound thoroughly, cleaning and flushing with plenty of soap and water for several minutes.</li>
                        <li>Immediately report all animal bites to your animal control agency, police department of health department for follow-up.</li>
                        <li>Identification and continual observation of the animal (if wild or stray) to aid identification of signs and symptoms of rabies</li>
                        <li>Rabies is a notifiable disease. It is very important to give immediate first aid to a person who has been bitten by a suspect animal.</li>
                        <li>In addition, you should educate the community members on the importance of immunising their domestic dogs and cats every three years and eliminating all stray dogs and cats.</li>
                    </ul>

                    </figure>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Wash out the wound with plenty of water, soap and a brush</li>
                        <li>Rinse again with plenty of water</li>
                        <li>Then apply disinfectant</li>
                        <li>Do not stitch the wound, but apply a swab and a slight compression bandage to stop the bleeding</li>
                        <li>Give tetanus toxoid vaccination</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Take a very thorough history. Refer to hospital for rabies immunisation if:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Known animal becomes ill and dies</li>
                        <li>Animal unknown and disappears</li>
                        <li>Animal looked rabid</li>
                        <li>Dead animal brought</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">BRUCELLOSIS</h3>
                    <p>Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease or disease of animals. It is caused by a bacteria called brucella melitensis in goats, sheep and camels, brucella abortus in cattle and brucella suis in pigs. All these bacteria however can be transmitted to mankind causing brucellosis.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Distribution</h4>
                    <p>Brucellosis has a worldwide distribution, predominantly in rural areas among pastoral communities. It is also an occupational health hazard of farmers, veterinarians, abattoir workers and butchers.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Transmission</h4>
                    <p>Brucellosis is transmitted through ingestion of unpasteurised milk or milk products such as cheese. It can also be transmitted by contact with blood, urine, tissues, through splashing of amniotic fluid or milk on the conjunctiva and blood transfusion.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Presentation</h4>
                    <p>The incubation period takes about two to four weeks. Initially the signs and symptoms are non-specific and include the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Headaches</li>
                        <li>Fever</li>
                        <li>Weakness</li>
                        <li>Anorexia</li>
                        <li>Rigors</li>
                        <li>Night sweats</li>
                        <li>Constipation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Patients may also complain of pain in the large joints like the hips and knees although any other joint may be affected. Hepatomegally, splenomegally and lymphadenopathy may also be present. If untreated, the disease can continue for many months and the patients may become depressed.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Diagnosis</h4>
                    <p>A serological diagnosis of brucellosis can be made by doing an agglutination test in dilutions. A level of 1:160 or above is associated with the infection. Blood cultures rarely give positive results but a bone marrow aspirate culture gives better yields of up to 90%. Full haemogram - normochromic, normocytic anaemia, neutropenia and lymphocytosis is common.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                    <p>The treatment of brucellosis is doxycycline 200 mg daily for 14-21 days and cotrimoxazole tabs 2 bd. for 14-21 days.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention</h4>
                    <p>You should educate the community and especially farmers on the importance of boiling or pasteurising milk. Animal handlers and those at special risk should be advised to take extra precautions.</p>
