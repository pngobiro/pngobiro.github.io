                        <p>Welcome to section two. In this section you will look at the main methods (also known as principles) that are used to control the occurrence and spread of communicable diseases. It is a short but intense section which will give you the foundation you need to prevent and control the diseases you shall cover in subsequent sections</p>
                        <p>Communicable disease can be controlled and eradicated from the community. When thinking about the control of diseases it is always good to think of all the possible methods. In most cases one or two specific methods will have the greatest effect and should be the focus of your activity, in other cases some methods will be useless against the disease. The aim of control is to tip the balance against the agent. The control and eradication of communicable diseases can be done by:</p>

Any person who is not yet infected by a specific disease-causing organism is known as a susceptible host. This is because they are at risk of contracting the infection.

                        <p>There are other useful measures that can be taken to control the spread of communicable disease. Among these is the notification of disease. Notification requires you to keep watch (surveillance) on the number of new cases of communicable diseases in your area of work and to immediately inform the local health authority when you come across a patient suffering from an infectious disease. One of the main reasons for notification is to help the health authorities take measures to confirm your suspicion and to control the spread of the disease. Notification of infectious communicable diseases is the responsibility of all health care workers. It is also a legal requirement according to the Public Health Act, Chapter (cap) 242, section eight of the laws of Kenya.</p>
