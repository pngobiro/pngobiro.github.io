                        <p>In this section you will look at helminthic diseases or diseases caused by worms. There is a wide variety of worms that can, like viruses and bacteria, get into the body of a human being.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes they present without causing any symptoms, sometimes they cause disease. Some only infect mankind and have a simple life cycle, entering the body through the mouth, living in the gut and leaving in the stools. Others have more complicated life cycles, entering the body through the skin, living in different organs, and having intermediate hosts for transmission.</p>
                        <p>In this section you will consider the common intestinal worms that fall under two groups, that is nematodes and flatworms.</p>

                        <p>Helminthic diseases are still a very common problem in Kenya, despite the fact that it is known how to prevent and treat them. They are common in low income areas such as slum settlements due to lack of proper facilities for human waste disposal as well as poor attitudes. The other factors which promote the spread of some helminths are:</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Helminthic diseases can be categorised into two groups: nematodes and flatworms.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nematodes (Cylindrical-Shaped Worms)</h3>
                        <p>This group is made up of cylinder shaped worms and includes threadworms, whipworms, and roundworms.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Threadworm or Pinworm</h4>
                        <p>The threadworm is caused by enterobius vermicularis. It has a worldwide distribution and mainly affects school aged children, especially in boarding schools. The children reinfect themselves when they scratch their anus and then transfer the eggs on their fingers to the mouth.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_08_23_9254c930aa5f31636a43g-66-1.jpg" alt="Life cycle of the pinworm." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p>Infection with enterobius vermicularis is maintained by direct transfer of infective eggs from the anus to the mouth (auto infection) or indirect contact through clothing, bedding, food and other articles. After ingestion, the eggs hatch in the stomach and small intestine. The worms mature in the lower small intestine and upper colon and then they migrate to the rectum where they discharge eggs on the perianal skin, especially during the night. This causes itching and consequently scratching.</p>
                        <p>The graphic illustrates the life cycle of the pinworm.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p><strong>List four clinical features of pinworm infestation.</strong></p>
                        <p>Your list should include the following signs and symptoms of pinworm infestation:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Mainly pruritus ani leading to intense scratching of the perianal region</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Disturbed sleep</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Restlessness</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Loss of appetite and weight loss</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>Diagnosis is mainly made by a laboratory examination of stool microscopy for ova and cyst.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <p>You should treat the whole family with mebendazole 100 mg given as a single dose. During treatment you should impress on the patient the importance of avoiding auto-infection.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h3>
                        <p>The prevention and control of this disease lies in improved personal hygiene and proper disposal of faeces. You should give health education on the importance of bathing and hand washing, keeping nails short, and how to prevent reinfection.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Whipworm</h4>
                        <p>This infestation is called trichuriasis because it is caused by an intestinal worm called Trichuris trichiura. The worm infects the large intestine and infestation is usually asymptomatic.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p>The transmission of trichuriasis is indirect, as the eggs passed in the faeces require embryonation in soil. Therefore unlike the threadworm, auto-infection is not possible.</p>
                        <p>When the embryonated eggs are ingested, they hatch and eventually the mature worms attach themselves to the mucosa of caecum and colon. They are mainly transmitted through food that is contaminated by soil or dirty fingers.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p>Often, mild infections are asymptomatic, but heavy infections may result in abdominal discomfort, bloody diarrhoea, loss of weight and prolapse of rectum.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>Diagnosis is made by examining a stool sample microscopically for ova and cyst.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <p>You can eliminate this infection by giving oral mebendazole 100 mg 12 hourly for three days.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h3>
                        <p>Just like the threadworm, the prevention of trichuriasis can be achieved through good personal hygiene and proper disposal of faeces.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Roundworm (Ascariasis)</h4>
                        <p>This disease is caused by Ascaris lumbricoides, which infects the small intestine.</p>
                        <p>Ascaris is a large intestinal parasite which often infects children because of their habit of putting all kinds of things in their mouth.</p>
                        <p>It is one of the commonest and most widespread infections of the small intestine. The worms may multiply in large numbers in the intestinal lumen and cause intestinal obstruction at the ileocaecal valve.</p>
                        <p>The worms also contribute to severe malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency, and may wander out of the intestinal lumen into the peritoneal cavity.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p>Ascariasis is a soil transmitted parasite. Once the eggs are passed out in faeces, they require embryonation in the soil before they can become infective. This takes 8-50 days. Embryonated eggs can be carried away from the contaminated place into houses by feet, footwear or in dust by the wind. Human beings may injest the eggs as they eat or drink using contaminated hands and utensils, or through eating raw contaminated foods like fruit. Once the eggs are ingested by a human being they hatch into worms.</p>
                        <p>In order to reach maturity, the larvae need to pass through the lungs and trachea to the pharynx.</p>
                        <p>Once in the pharynx they are swallowed and return to the gastrointestinal tract where they can live for about a year.</p>
                        <p>The graphic illustrates the life cycle of Ascaris lumbricoides.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_08_23_9254c930aa5f31636a43g-68-1.jpg" alt="Life cycle of Ascaris lumbricoides." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p>Infection with a few ascaris is usually asymptomatic and if symptoms are present, they are not characteristic.</p>
                        <p>There may be vague abdominal discomfort or occasionally the worm may leave the body in vomitus or stool. Also during the stage of larval migration through the lungs there may be temporary symptoms of pneumonitis (cough).</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>Diagnosis is by stool microscopy which should show ascaris ova and cyst.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <p>Any one of the following drug treatments is useful in the management of ascariasis.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Oral mebendazole 100 mg 12 hourly for three days</span></li>

                        <p>Note: For intestinal obstruction, surgical operation is indicated.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h3>
                        <p>The prevention and control of ascariasis involves the following measures:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Hookworm (Ancylostomiasis)</h4>
                        <p>This is an infection of the small intestine by a blood-sucking worm called Ancylostoma duodenale or necator americanus.</p>
                        <p>In East Africa, necator americanus is the cause of the disease.</p>
                        <p>The worm causes severe iron deficiency anaemia and protein loss.</p>
                        <p>Each adult necator americanus worm causes a daily loss of 0.03 ml of blood from the patient. In many infected individuals the disease is asymptomatic because the hookworm load is light.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p>Hookworm eggs are embryonated by the time they are passed out with faeces. Indeed, when the faeces stand for a long time before examination the free larvae can be found.</p>
                        <p>When an infected person passes faeces in the soil, the larvae bury themselves in the moist damp soil. The larvae are called rhabditiform and only become infective after five days, when they change into the sheathed filariform stage.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_08_23_9254c930aa5f31636a43g-70-1.jpg" alt="Hookworm life cycle." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>As soon as the filariform larvae come into contact with a human leg or foot, they penetrate actively through the skin and reach the lungs via the venous system and the right side of the heart.</p>
                        <p>Once in the lungs they penetrate the alveoli and are carried to the larynx and pharynx, from here they are swallowed into the stomach.</p>
                        <p>When they reach the stomach they attach themselves to the wall of the abdomen with hook-like teeth and start to suck blood from the patient's body.</p>

                        <p>In most of the cases, hookworm infestation tends to be asymptomatic. However the following signs and symptoms are indicative of hookworm infestation:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>Diagnosis of hookworm infestation is made by stool microscopy which should show ova and cysts and in some cases occult blood. More than 100 eggs in an ordinary faecal smear indicate heavy infection.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <p>The following drugs are commonly used in the treatment of hookworm infections:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Flatworms</h3>
                        <p>This group is made up of flat or segmented worms, their intermediate hosts are mainly animals, such as cattle, pigs and dogs.</p>
                        <p>You will look at two worm diseases under this group, namely tapeworms and hydatidosis.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Tapeworm (Taeniasis)</h4>
                        <p>There are various types of tapeworms, but in human beings the infestations are commonly caused by:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Taenia saginata or beef tapeworm (commonest infection)</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>You will now consider each type in turn.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Taenia Saginata or Beef Tapeworm</h4>
                        <p>Infection with the beef tapeworm is common in areas where beef is eaten raw or lightly cooked.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p>The eggs of adult tapeworms living in the small intestines of human beings are passed in the stools.</p>
                        <p>They are then ingested by cows as they feed on contaminated grass. Once in the gastrointestinal tract of the cow, the embryos hatch and penetrate the bowel wall and are carried via the bloodstream to striated muscles. Here the larvae grow and form infective cysts called cysticerci.</p>
                        <p>When human beings ingest cow meat containing these cysts, the cysts are dissolved by the gastric acid in the stomach to release embryos.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p>Most tapeworm infections caused by taenia saginata do not cause any signs or symptoms. However, some people may complain of loss of weight, abdominal discomfort and itching around the anus (pruritis ani).</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>Diagnosis of tapeworm infestation can be made by the presence in the stool of segments or eggs. The eggs are not laid singly and appear only accidentally in the stools.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <p>Drug treatment with oral niclosamide is effective. The dose is 1 gm chewed and swallowed with water followed one hour later with 1 gm (a total of 2 gm ).</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Taenia Solium (Pork Tapeworm)</h4>
                        <p>This disease occurs when a person ingests pork infected with the taenia solium larvae. Whereas in the beef tapeworm the embryo attaches itself to the wall of the small bowel and grows into an adult worm, the pork tapeworm behaves differently.</p>
                        <p>The embryo penetrates the intestinal wall of the human as it does the pig, and it is carried to organs like striated muscle or the brain. This can cause serious problems such as epilepsy and death.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p>Taenia solium is a dangerous worm and the signs and symptoms depend on the organ it has invaded as follows:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">In the brain it causes epilepsy</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>Diagnosis of taenia solium infections can be made by doing the following tests:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Biopsy examination of the infected tissue</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <p>The management involves both the surgical removal of calcified cysticercus where possible as well as drug treatment with niclosamide 2 gm .</p>
                        <p>The dose is 1 gm chewed and washed down with water followed one hour later by 1 gm .</p>
                        <p><strong>What measures would you recommend for the prevention and control of taeniasis?</strong></p>
                        <p>The prevention and control of taeniasis can be achieved through the following simple measures:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Hydatidosis (Hydatid Disease)</h4>
                        <p>The hydatidosis disease is actually a disease of dogs (zoonotic).</p>
                        <p>Human beings become infected only by accident. Nevertheless, the disease is a serious problem among the Turkana community of northern Kenya.</p>
                        <p>It is also known as echinococcosis or hydatid disease.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p>Hydatidosis is caused by the cysts of the dog tapeworm known as Echinococcus granulosis. Dogs and other carnivores such as jackals and lions are the hosts of the dog tapeworm.</p>
                        <p>The eggs are passed in the faeces of an infected dog and ingested by domesticated animals such as sheep, goats, cattle, camels, donkeys, and wild antelopes. The eggs hatch in the animal's intestine and penetrate through the intestinal wall to the portal circulation. They are then carried to the liver and lungs where they form many cysts. When a dog eats the diseased animal it becomes infected with these cysts, which then proceed to develop into mature worms.</p>
                        <p>Human beings become infected when they accidentally ingest eggs from dog faeces. The larvae migrate from the intestine to the liver or lungs causing cysts. The larvae can also cause cysts in other tissue in the body.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p>In the liver, the cyst grows slowly over time thereby enlarging the liver. The abdomen may also become grossly distended.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>This is done through a chest x-ray or an abdominal ultrasound investigation. A serological test can also be done to assist in making the diagnosis.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <p>The treatment of hydatid disease can either be medical or surgical.</p>
                        <p>The medical treatment is as follows:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Oral albendazole 20 mg/kg in divided doses twice daily for 30 days (The cure rate with this treatment is 20%). The treatment can arrest the growth of the cyst and reduce its size</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">PAIR (Puncture, Aspiration, Instillation of 95% alcohol and Re-aspiration). This is the treatment for the liver or spleen. The ultrasound machine is used to guide the PAIR procedure. This treatment is very effective and has a high cure rate</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The surgical treatment is known as endocystectomy. It is the surgical removal of the cysts contents, especially those cysts that are easily accessible like abdominal cysts.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h3>
                        <p>The prevention and control of the hydatid disease can be achieved by eradicating stray dogs and deworming them. Deworming should be done every six weeks with praziquantel.</p>
                        <p>You should also provide health education on the dangers of close contact with dogs (licking), especially among children. Also, infected meat should not be fed to dogs.</p>
