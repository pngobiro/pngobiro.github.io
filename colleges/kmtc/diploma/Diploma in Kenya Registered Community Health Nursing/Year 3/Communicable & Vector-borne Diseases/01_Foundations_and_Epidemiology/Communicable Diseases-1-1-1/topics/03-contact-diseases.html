From this section onwards, you will group communicable diseases according to their mode of transmission and then investigate their individual causes, mode of transmission, diagnosis, treatment and preventive measures. You will start with contact diseases (also known as contagious diseases). This is a group of communicable diseases that are transmitted through direct or indirect contact between susceptible and infected persons.</p>

                        <p>A large number of patients seen in your health facility, particularly school children, are suffering from contact diseases which are easily preventable. Contact diseases tend to occur in clusters within households, children's play groups, schools and workplaces. They are passed from one person to another either directly by skin-to-skin contact or indirectly by handling contaminated objects such as clothing, bedding or combs. Such groups of infected people are known as clusters.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This is a parasitic infection of the superficial layer of the skin characterised by severe itching. It is caused by the female of an insect called Sarcoptes Scabiei (itch mite). The female mite burrows in to the skin and makes a small tunnel. Within the tunnel, the insect deposits its eggs and faeces. The eggs hatch in four to five days and the larvae leave the mother's tunnel and bury themselves in the skin and in other places. The larvae do not make tunnels.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p>Scabies is spread through direct close body contact, as in bed, or through contact between parents and children or among children playing together in schools. Transmission of scabies can also occur indirectly through clothing or bedclothes. Poor living conditions and poor hygiene promotes the spread of scabies.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Picture</h3>
                        <p>The patient presents with intense itching, especially at night, and eczema-like signs. You will also find an itchy rash with typical distribution especially where the skin is curved (between fingers, elbows, buttocks, etc). Because it is very itchy, you might also find that the skin is torn with scratches and thus secondary infection often follows.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of reasons why people with scabies do not seek early medical attention. The skin lesions may be so common that they are not considered to be a disease. Also people who suffer from leprosy or other diseases which interfere with normal sensation may not feel the itching caused by scabies.</p>

                        <p>The whole family should be treated together with the patient to prevent re-infection. The management of scabies is as follows:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention of Scabies</h3>
                        <p>The best way of preventing and treating scabies is good personal hygiene. Regular firm bathing, washing of clothes and frequent use of soap will control scabies.</p>
