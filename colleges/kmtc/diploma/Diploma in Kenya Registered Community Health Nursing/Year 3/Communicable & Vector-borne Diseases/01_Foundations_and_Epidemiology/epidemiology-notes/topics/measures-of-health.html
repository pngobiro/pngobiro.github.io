                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Attack Rate</strong> = Number of new cases of a specified disease reported during an epidemic period of time / Population at risk during the same time interval</p>
                        <p><strong>Secondary Attack Rate</strong> = Number of new cases of a specified disease among contacts of known cases / Size of contact population at risk</p>
