A comprehensive assessment of a dermatologic condition includes the history given by the patient (subjective data) and the findings of the physical examination of the integumentary system (objective data).

                        <p>Lesions can be defined as primary or secondary. Primary lesions are structural changes in the skin that have specific, visual characteristics and develop without any preceding skin changes. Secondary lesion is one that has changed due to natural progression or due to physical factors such as rubbing or scratching. Special or "other" lesions are those that occur in the skin only and in the skin most often or can be perceived most easily on the skin.</p>
