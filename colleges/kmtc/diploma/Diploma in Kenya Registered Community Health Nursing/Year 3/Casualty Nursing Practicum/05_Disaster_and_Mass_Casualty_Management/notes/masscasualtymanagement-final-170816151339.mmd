\section*{Death toll in Sarangkot bus accident reaches five}

Pokhara, March 6: The death toll in the Sarangkot bus accident has reached five and the number of injured 52.
The deceased have been identified as 50-year-old Hari Bahadur Khatri, 40-year-old Goma Luintel of Kaskikot, 50-year-old Hari Bahadur Khatri, 45-year-old Tara Thapa and 16-year-ild Diwas Timalsina of Pokhara Sub-Metropolitan City, said Superintendent of Police at the District Police office, Kaski, Hari Bahadur Pal told RSS on the phone.

Of the injured, condition of four is critical, according to the DPO, Kaski. Pal said critically injured eight-month-old Alis Thapa and 25-year-old Sabita Khadka have been airlifted to Kathmandu for treatment.

He said, "Preparations are underway to send the remaining critically injured Suman Thapa, 18, and Din Bahadur Dhakal, 25, of Pokhara Sub-Metropolitan City for treatment and waiting for helicopter."

The other injured are receiving medical treatment at different hospitals in Pokhara.
A bus (Ga 1 Kha 4849) heading towards Pokhara from Guntechour of Kaski, fell some 150 meters into a ravine, according to the DPO.

\section*{Mass Casualty Incident (MCI)}
- An incident which generates more patients at one time than locally available resources can manage using routine procedures.
- It requires exceptional emergency arrangements and additional or extraordinary assistance.
- The Objective of MCl is to move all patients to a medical facility as soon as possible.
- One has to do what is practically possible for the greatest number of victims.

\section*{Disaster}
- Any occurrence that causes damage, economic disruption, loss of human life and deterioration in health and health services on a scale sufficient to warrant an extraordinary response from outside the affected area or community.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_22_7cd855d2eb8f04ad7a19g-06.jpg?height=849&width=1416&top_left_y=1026&top_left_x=845)

\section*{Characteristics of Disaster}
1. The normal function of a community is disrupted.
2. Disaster exceed the coping mechanism of community.
3. The disruption is of such magnitude that there is an inability to return to normal functioning without external assistance.

\section*{Types of Disaster}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline NATURAL & MAN MADE \\
\hline Earthquake & Road Traffic Accident \\
\hline Flood & Building Collapse \\
\hline Hurricane & Conventional warfare \\
\hline Volcanic Eruption & Hazardous chemical incident \\
\hline Drought & Nuclear \& Biological incident \\
\hline & Air Craft Crash \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Hospitals \& Disaster}
- Hospitals serve as the major resource for the intake, evaluation \& treatment of patients affected by disaster.
- It is vital that hospital preparedness personnel identify vulnerable people, structures and services in their hospital community so that these can be made more resilient to the effects of disaster.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_22_7cd855d2eb8f04ad7a19g-09.jpg?height=537&width=1133&top_left_y=1138&top_left_x=1364)

\section*{Issues to be addressed by Hospital}
1. Surge capacity for additional space for treatment and evaluation.
2. Medication and supply stockpiles
3. Structural integrity
4. Trained staff
5. Response protocol and proper disaster response procedures.
6. Functional hospital based disaster plan

\section*{Role of Hospital in Disaster Management}
- A disaster will involve the entire hospital there will be increased demands upon equipment and personnel
- The hospital's response will have to be managed and coordinated
- Staff will need to be supported throughout response and recovery.

\section*{Steps in MCI Management}
1. Triage
2. Primary Survery
3. Secondary Survey
4. Treatment
5. Documentation

\section*{Triage}
- [French, from trier, to sort]
- A method of quickly identifying victims who have immediately life-threatening injuries AND who have the best chance of surviving.
- Aim of triage : To achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of casualty

\section*{Types of Triage}
1. M.A.S.S. Triage : based on patients ability to move
2. S.T.A.R.T. Triage : determines severity of injuries
3. Advanced Triage : More fully assess injury priority

\section*{Concept of "Golden Hour"}
- Golden Hour is a concept of trauma care developed by Dr Adams Cowley
- Refers to the amount of time from injury to definitive care that should be allotted to maximize survival from traumatic injury.
- Most studies have shown, if care given within first hour of injury
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_22_7cd855d2eb8f04ad7a19g-15.jpg?height=769&width=1088&top_left_y=615&top_left_x=1409)
morbidity and mortality can be reduced.

\section*{START Triage}
- START stands for Simple Triage \& Rapid Treatment
- Rapid approach to triaging large numbers of causalities
- Fast, Easy to use, Easy to remember
- Allows the most good for the most patients with the least amount of resources.

\section*{START Triage}

- Intubation equipments
- Management of Shock
- Surgical gauge pack, roll bandages, IV cannula, crystalloids and colloid, Access to blood bank, Traction splints
- Emergency Drugs
- The equipments \& drugs should be in bulk and readily available during mass casualty incident.

\section*{Contingency}
- Planning is the key to the proper response to a mass casualty incident.
- Worst case scenario must be thought through and procedures developed for each possibility.

\section*{Observation \& Holding Area}
- During an influx of patients to a hospital temporary patient care areas may have to be established like lobby areas \& corridors.
