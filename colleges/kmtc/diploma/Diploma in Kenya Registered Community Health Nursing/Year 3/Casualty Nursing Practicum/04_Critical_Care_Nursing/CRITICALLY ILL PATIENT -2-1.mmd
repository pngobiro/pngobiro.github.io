\section*{Cont....3.Muscle dystrophy}
- This is due to loss of muscle strength and tone due to lack of motion and exercises, reduced neuromuscular activity to many parts of the body.
Management.
- Instruct patient to perform small exercise, Inform the physiotherapist to do exercises on the daily basis.
4. D.V.T (Deep venous thrombosis)
- This is due to prolonged immobility and this brings about stasis of blood causing embolization in the Deep veins of the calf muscles, pelvic. This embolus logdes into the walls of the pulmonary artery producing symptoms such as chest pains, cough, hemoptysis, restlessness etc.
- At the site of the formation of the emboli, the area looks shiny, warm, tender and swollen due to inflammation of the vein.

Management

\section*{Causes of Bed sores}
1. Wetting of beddings by the unconscious patient
2.Prolonged stay in bed without turning.
3.Obesity.
4.Very sick patients.

\section*{Areas prone to pressure sores}

- Do 2 hrly turning and maintain record of the turning chart.
- Straighten the linen on bed to avoid effects on the pressure areas.
- Catheterize the patient to avoid wetting the bed which causes breaking of the skin.
- Do exercises for the patient to avoid stasis of blood.

\section*{6.Contructures.}

This is the failure of the musculoskeletal system to attain normal flexion and extension due to immobility and unconsciousness and lack of exercises.
- The most affected areas of the body include upper and lower limps joints.

\section*{Management}
