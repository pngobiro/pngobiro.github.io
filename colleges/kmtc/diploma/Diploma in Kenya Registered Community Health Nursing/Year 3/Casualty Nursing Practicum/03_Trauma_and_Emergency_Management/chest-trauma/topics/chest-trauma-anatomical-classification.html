                        <p>Pleural injuries also involves lung parenchyma</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Hemothorax</h3>
                        <p>Classified according to the amount of blood:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Minimal, 350 mL</li>
                            <li>Moderate, $350-1500 \mathrm{~mL}$;</li>
                            <li>Massive, 1500 mL or more.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>-Rate of bleeding after evacuation of the hemothorax even more important. If air is also present, the condition is called hemopneumothorax</p>
                        <p>-Hemothorax should be suspected with penetrating or severe blunt thoracic injury.</p>
                        <p>-Clinically-Reduced chest movements, dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds</p>
                        <p>-CXR (upright or semiupright, ) should be promptly obtained.</p>
                        <p>-Tube thoracostomy using one or two large-bore pleural catheters should be performed promptly</p>
                        <p>In 85\% of cases, tube thoracostomy and circulatory support are the only treatment required.</p>
                        <p>-If bleeding is persistent, as noted by continued output from the chest tubes, it is more likely to be from a systemic (eg, intercostal) rather than a pulmonary artery.</p>
                        <p>A portion of the chest wall becomes isolated by multiple fractures moves in and out with inspiration and expiration with severe reduction in ventilatory efficiency.</p>
                        <p>Is dangerous because of the paradoxical movement of the flail segment to the rest of the ribs cage and thus the area of the lung under it is not ventilated and may collapse.</p>
                        <p>Atelectasis, hypercapnia, hypoxia, accumulation of secretions, and ineffective cough occur.</p>
                        <h4>Management options</h4>
                        <p>Less severe cases, intercostal nerve block or continuous epidural analgesia may be adequate treatment otherwise</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Hemi-thorax strapping</li>

                        <p>Sedate patient and do the positive pressure ventilation</p>

                            <li>Tracheostomy</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This reduces the work of breathing by reduction of dead space and thus reduces the paradoxical movement of the flail segment. Give humidified oxygen.</p>
                        <ol type="i" start="4">
                            <li>Thoracotomy and ORIF</li>

                        <p>Drill two holes in each rib and hold using wire.</p>
                        <p>In most cases, the chest wall is the source of hemorrhage, but the lung, heart, pericardium, and great vessels account for 15-25\%.</p>
                        <h4>Indication for thoracotomy</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Initail drainage of fluid $>1500 \mathrm{~L}$ and still draining</li>
                            <li>Draiange rate $>200 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$ for 3 or more hours</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pneumothorax</h3>
                        <h4>Types</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Open pneumothorax</li>
                            <li>Closed</li>
                            <li>Tension</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>-Lacerations of the lung or chest wall following penetrating or blunt chest trauma. Prompt occlusive dressing should be done for open pneumothorax before tube insertion.</p>
                        <p>-Hyperinflation (eg, blast injuries, diving accidents) can also rupture the lungs. After penetrating injury, $80 \%$ of patients with pneumothorax also have blood in the pleural cavity.</p>
                        <p>-Tension pneumothorax develops when a flap-valve leak allows air to enter the pleural space but prevents its escape; intrapleural pressure rises causing total collapse of the lung and a shift of the mediastinal viscera to the opposite side.</p>
                        <p>-It must be relieved immediately to avoid interference with ventilation in the opposite lung and impairment of cardiac function.</p>
                        <p>NB For any impaled or penetrating objects still on the chest should left in situ until the patient is in theatre.</p>
                        <p>Bandage and stabilize the object to avoid further injury.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Heart and Pericardium:</h2>
                        <p>-The injury varies from localized contusion to cardiac rupture.</p>
                        <p>-Early clinical findings include friction rubs, chest pain, tachycardia, murmurs, dysrhythmias, or signs of low cardiac output.</p>
                        <p>-ECGs show nonspecific ST and T wave changes. Serial tracings should be obtained, since abnormalities s may not appear for 24 hours.</p>
                        <p>-Hemopericardium may occur without tamponade and can be treated by pericardiocentesis. Tamponade in blunt cardiac trauma is often due to myocardial rupture or coronary artery laceration.</p>
                        <p>-Cardiac Tamponade produces</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Distended neck veins</li>
                            <li>Muffled heart sounds</li>
                            <li>Shock</li>
                            <li>Cyanosis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>-Immediate thoracotomy and control of the injury are indicated.</p>
                        <p>-Treatment of injuries to the valves, papillary muscles, and septum must be individualized; when tolerated, delayed repair is usually recommended.</p>
                        <p>-Pericardial lacerations from stab wounds tend to seal and cause tamponade, whereas gunshot wounds leave a sufficient pericardial opening for drainage. -Gunshot wounds produce more extensive myocardial damage multiple perforations, and massive bleeding into the pleural space.</p>
                        <p>Hemothorax, shock, and exsanguination occur in nearly all cases of cardiac gunshot wounds.</p>
                        <p>-Treatment of penetrating cardiac injuries has gradually changed from initial management by pericardiocentesis to prompt thoracotomy and pericardial decompression.</p>
                        <p>-Pericardiocentesis is reserved for selected cases when the diagnosis is uncertain or in preparation for thoracotomy. The myocardial laceration is closed with sutures</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Diaphragm</h2>
                        <p>-Penetrating injuries of the diaphragm outnumber blunt diaphragmatic injuries by at least 4:1.</p>
                        <p>-Wounds of the diaphragm must not be overlooked, because they rarely heal spontaneously and because herniation of abdominal viscera into the chest can occur either immediately or years after the injuries.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Indications for thoracotomy</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Cardicac tamponade</li>
                            <li>Initial drain through the chest tube $>1.5 \mathrm{~L}$ and continuing</li>
                            <li>Hourly drain $>200 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$ for more than 3 hours</li>
                            <li>Electro cardiac dissociation</li>
                            <li>Intraabdomial bleeding in excess indicating a thoraco-abdominal injury</li>
                            <li>Persistent pneumothorax even with adequate drainage suggesting injury to trachea or bronchi. Confirmed by bronchoscopy</li>
                            <li>Diaphragmatic injury</li>
                            <li>Large Chest wall defects</li>
                            <li>High velocity injuries</li>
                            <li>Impaled objects on the chest in situ</li>
                            <li>Trans mediastinal injury</li>
                            <li>Delayed indications Clotted hemothorax, Lung abscess or fistula formation.</li>
                            <li>Failure of resuscitation measures</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Trachea and Bronchus:</h2>
                        <p>-Blunt tracheobronchial injuries are often due to compression of the airway between the sternum and the vertebral column in decelerating injury</p>
                        <p>-Patients present with</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pneumothorax or hemopneumothorax</li>
                            <li>Subcutaneous emphysema</li>
                            <li>Cervicofacial emphysema</li>
                            <li>Pneumo mediastinum</li>
                            <li>Hemoptysis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>-Suspected with massive air leak or when the lung does not readily re-expand after chest tube placement</p>
                        <p>-In penetrating injuries of the trachea or main bronchi, there is usually massive hemorrhage and hemoptysis.</p>
                        <p>-Systemic air embolism resulting in cardiopulmonary arrest may occur if a bronchovenous fistula is present.</p>
                        <p>-Diagnosis may require tracheobronchoscopy. Primary repair is indicated for tracheobronchial lacerations.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Lung Injury</h2>
                        <p>-Pulmonary contusion due to blunt or penetrating injuries.</p>
                        <p>-Alveolar rupture with fluid transudation and extravasation of blood are early findings. These enter alveolar spaces and bronchi and produce localized airway obstruction and atelectasis.</p>
                        <p>-Increased mucous secretions and overzealous intravenous fluid therapy may combine to produce copious secretions (wet lung) and further atelectasis.</p>
                        <p>-Blood oxygenation and pH drop and $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ rises.</p>
                        <p>-Treatment is often delayed because clinical and x-ray findings may not appear until 12-24 hours after injury.</p>
                        <p>-The clinical findings are loose, copious, blood-tinged secretions, chest pain, restlessness, apprehensiveness, and labored respirations.Eventually, dyspnea, cyanosis, tachypnea, and tachycardia develop.</p>
                        <p>- X-ray changes consist of patchy parenchymal opacification or diffuse linear peribronchial densities that may progress to diffuse opacification ("white-out").</p>
                        <p>- Mechanical ventilatory support permits adequate alveolar ventilation with oxygen.</p>
                        <p>-Most lung lacerations are caused by penetrating injuries, and hemopneumothorax is usually present. Tube thoracostomy is indicated to evacuate pleural air or blood and to monitor continuing leak</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Esophagus:</h2>
                        <p>-Esophagus is well protected, and perforation from external penetrating trauma is relatively infrequent. Blunt injuries are very rare.</p>
                        <p>-Symptom of esophageal perforation is chest pain; fever develops within hours in most patients.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Regurgitation of blood</li>
                            <li>Hoarseness</li>
                            <li>Dysphagia</li>
                            <li>Respiratory distress may also be present.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>-Physical findings include</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Shock</li>
                            <li>Pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum</li>
                            <li>Local tenderness</li>
                            <li>Subcutaneous emphysema,</li>
                            <li>Hamman's sign (ie, pericardial or mediastinal "crunch" synchronous with cardiac sounds)</li>
                            <li>Leukocytosis occurs soon after injury.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>-A nasogastric tube should be passed to evacuate gastric contents. If recognized within 24-48 hours of injury, the esophageal perforation should be closed and pleural drainage instituted with large-bore catheters.</p>
                        <p>-Illness and death are due topneumothoraxor mediastinum , mediastinal and pleural infection.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Thoracic Duct:</h2>
                        <p>-Chylothorax and chylopericardium are rare complications of trauma but, when they occur, are difficult to manage.</p>
                        <p>-Penetrating injuries of the neck, thorax, or upper abdomen can injure the thoracic duct or its major tributaries. The occurrence of chylothorax after a trivial injury should lead one to suspect underlying cancer.</p>
                        <p>-Chest tube drainage should be instituted if the effusion recurs. Intravenous hyperalimentation with no oral intake may be effective in persistent leaks.</p>
                        <p>-Three or 4 weeks of conservative treatment usually are curative.</p>
                        <p>- If daily chyle loss exceeds 1500 mL for 5 successive days or persists after 2-3 weeks of conservative treatment, the thoracic duct should be ligated via a right thoracotomy.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">The sternum</h2>
                        <p>-These fractures are usually transverse and may overlap, causing agonizing pain.</p>
                        <p>- Internal fixation is required to correct deformity and relieve the discomfort of instability.</p>
                        <p>-This is performed by making an incision in the xiphisternum and passing a Steinmann pin up through the medulla of both sternum fragments from underneath.</p>
