\section*{CHEST TRAUMA}

Broadly chest trauma could be:
a) Mechanical-high or low velocity
b) Chemical
c) Thermal

Mechanical trauma may be further classified as:
1) Penetrating
2) Non-penetrating -Blunt and Crush injuries
3) Inhalational injury
4) Aspiration of foreign body

2 major forces within the chest which lead to injury are the compression and distraction injuries.
Compression results in destruction of vascular structures, haemorrhage, edema and impairment of function. Distraction injuries usually result in shearing forces which destroy the integrity of intrathoracic viscera.
Penetrating injuries
$-61 \%$ of chest trauma admissions. Result in parenchymal damage related to track of missile or stabbing, implant used and velocity. Solid structures as the heart and major great vessels suffer more injuries
-Most lethal complication is haemorrhage
-Often associated with abdominal injury
Non-penetrating injuries
Blunt (acceleration and deceleration injuries)
Sudden reduction in speed as in RTA. Aortic rapture as a cause of death on spot is not uncommon.
Care should be taken while dealing with the very young or the elderly.
Crush injuries
Occurs where the elastic limit of the chest wall and its limit have been exceeded. Patients usually have AP deformity
Majority have flail chests, hemothorax or pneumothorax Most has pulmonary contusion. Injuries of the heart ,Aorta, liver ,spleen ,kidney are common
In "Traumatic asphyxia" syndrome-constrictive forces are applied in wide area for as little as 2-5 minutes
Crush injuries have high mortality.

Pathophysiology in chest injury
1.Hypoxia -Reduced air exchange
2.Acidosis -Anaerobic respiration
3.Low Cardiac output-Hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock

\section*{CASUALTY MANAGEMENT}
1.PRIMARY SURVEY
2.SECONDARY SURVEY
3.INVESTIGATION
4.TRANSFER TO WARD OR THEATRE

\section*{PRIMARY SURVEY}

The majority of chest injuries are confined to the thoracic cage. These consist of rib fractures with underlying pulmonary contusion, haemothorax, or pneumothorax. Can be treated effectively simply by chest drain insertion and fluid restriction

\section*{4. Auscultate (LISTEN)}
-Pneumothorax/hemothorax (decreased breath sounds on site of injury)
-Detection of abnormal sounds in the chest.
Immediate intervention
1. Tension pneumothorax-put through a needle then chest tube insertion
2. Massive pneumothorax-chest tubes insertion

Early deaths caused by in chest injuries are usually caused by: Conditions that would impair breathing
1) Airway obstruction
2) Open pneumothorax
3) Massive hemothorax
4) Tension pneumothorax
5) Flail chest
6) Cardiac tamponade

Later deaths are due to
1) Respiratory failure
2) Sepsis
3) Unrecognized injuries

The basis for successful management of thoracic trauma is effective cardio pulmonary resuscitation followed by early detection and treatment of lifethreatening injuries.

\section*{INITIAL MANAGEMENT-Primary Survey}
$1^{\text {st }}$ is $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{D}$ of resuscitation plus vital signs
1. Airway and cervical spine.

Maintain cervical spine immobilization in all unconscious or symptomatic (neck pain or tenderness) patients.
i)-Inspect mouth remove debris by sweeping through
ii)Chin lift/jaw thrust (tongue is attached to the jaw) and always airway in tongue falling back
To perform a chin lift, place two fingers under the mandible and gently lift upward to bring the chin anterior. During this manoeuvre, be careful not to hyperextend the neck. Care should be given to neck stabilization, if appropriate.
The jaw thrust is performed by manually elevating the angles of the mandible to obtain the same effect.
iii) Secure airway by Guedel airway/oropharyngeal airway. Insert the oral airway into the mouth behind the tongue; it is usually inserted upside down until the palate is encountered and is then rotated 180 degrees.
iv) Intubations; keep the neck immobilized in neutral position. Use sedation and short acting neuromuscular blockade if necessary. If not possible to intubate:
v) Tracheostomy
vi) Cricothyrotomy
2. Breathing: Oxygenation and ventilation.

Check for the six conditions that would impair breathing.
1 Inspect (LOOK)
Inspection of respiratory rate and evidence of respiratory distress is essential. Are any of the following present?
-Use of accessory muscles,flaring of alae nasae
-Cyanosis-lips
-Chest movements(chest excursions)
-Penetrating injury in the chest or Sucking chest wounds
-Presence of flail chest
2 Palpate (FEEL)
-Tracheal shift
-Broken ribs
-Subcutaneous emphysema.
-Chest expansion
3.Percusion

Percussion is useful for diagnosis of haemothorax(dull) and pneumothorax (hyperesonant)
3. Sucking wounds-strap the open wound then chest tube insertion.
4. Flail chest-positive pressure ventilation
5. Cardiac tamponade

Resuscitation action
-Insert an intercostal drainage tube as a matter of priority, and before chest X-ray if respiratory distress exists, to drain the chest pleura of air and blood
-When indications for intubation exist but the trachea cannot be intubated, consider using a laryngeal mask airway or direct access via a cricothyroidotomy.
If available, maintain the patient on oxygen until complete stabilization is achieved -If a you suspect a tension pneumothorax, introduce a large-bore needle into the pleural cavity through the second intercostal space, mid clavicular line, to decompress the tension and allow time for the placement of an intercostal tube
- If intubation in one or two attempts is not possible, a cricothyroidotomy should be considered a priority

\section*{3. Circulation and arrest of bleeding.}
"Shock" is defined as inadequate organ perfusion and tissue oxygenation. In the trauma patient, it is most often due to haemorrhage and hypovolaemia.
The diagnosis of shock is based on clinical findings:
- Hypotension
- Hypothermia
- Tachycardia
- Tachypnoea
- Pallor
- Cool extremities
- Decreased capillary refill
- Decreased urine production

Haemorrhagic (hypovolaemic)
-Shock is due to acute loss of blood or fluids. The amount of blood loss after trauma is often poorly assessed and in blunt trauma is usually underestimated. Remember:
-Large volumes of blood may be hidden in the abdominal and pleural cavity.
-Femoral shaft fracture may lose up to 1.0-1.5 litres of blood
-Pelvic fracture often loses in excess of 2 litres of blood.
Cardiogenic shock
Cardiogenic shock is due to inadequate heart function. This may result from
-Myocardial contusion (bruising)
-Cardiac tamponade
-Tension pneumothorax (preventing blood returning to heart)
- Penetrating wound of the heart
-Myocardial infarction.
Assessment of the jugular venous pressure is essential in these circumstances and an ECG should be recorded, if available.

\section*{1.Simple fractures}

Main management is to provide analgesia, reduce pain and allow ventilatory movements.
Analgesia may be systemic or local
Systemic analgesia
i. Paracetamol
ii. NSAIDS
iii. Opiods
iv. Combination

Local analgesia
-Intercostal block usually administered as a mixture of short acting (cylocaine or
Procaine) and long acting(Bupivacine) local anaesthetic plus a steroid
-Inject the intercostals space involved plus two above and two below because of the overlap of the sensory innervation
-Usually is cumbersome to do this for a single fracture, more reasonable for multiple rib fractures.
-Injection is done below the rib and along the medial border of the scapula.
Risks
-Bleeding
-Penetration of pleura-pneumothorax and hemothorax
2.Multiple fractures
-Firm strapping of the thorax in a hemi-thorax fashion.
-May give systemic analgesia or local analgesia as above.
Firm strapping not done in older patients because may interfere with respiration.
3.Flail chest/segment

Is due to the loss of sympathetic tone, usually resulting
from spinal cord injury. The classical presentation is hypotension without reflex tachycardia or skin vasoconstriction.
Septic shock
Is rare in the early phase of trauma, but is a common cause of late death (via multi-organ failure) in the weeks following injury. It is most commonly seen in penetrating abdominal injury and burns patients.

\section*{Resusciation}
-First priority is to stop any obvious bleeding by Sub fascial gauze pack
placement and Manual compression on the proximal artery. Carefully applied compressive dressing of the entire injured limb can be done. Then
-Vascular access 2 large bore size 16 on the 2-basilic veins
-Fluids: infuse $0.9 \% \mathrm{NaCl}$ initially 2 L to run as fact as possible through 2 large bore IV lines in the antecubital fossa then re-assess
-Resuscitate to goal of mean arterial pressure (MAP) $>90 \mathrm{mmHg}$ to maintain a presumptive cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) $>60 \mathrm{mmHg}$
-Urinary catheter insertion and monitor the input and output chart at least 30$50 \mathrm{ml} /$ hour or $0.5 / \mathrm{kg} /$ hour of urine flow
-Monitor by vital signs, pallor, sweating, anxiety, skin warmth clammy, input and output
-Blood transfusion must be considered when the patient has persistent haemodynamic instability despite fluid (colloid/crystalloid) infusion.
If type specific or cross matched blood is not available, use group O negative packed red blood cells. Transfusion should, however, be seriously considered if the haemoglobin level is less than $7 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ and the patient is still bleeding.

\section*{4.Neurological dysfuction}

Establish preliminary level of consciousness by AVPU
A -Awake, V -Verbal response, P- Painful response
U -Unresponsive
and any focal neurologic deficits.

\section*{5.Exposure and environmental modification}

Cover patient in case of shock and shivering

\section*{ANATOMICAL CLASSIFICATIONOF CHEST INJURIES}

\section*{A.Skin and Subcutaneous tissue}

Cuts and bruises
Superficial cuts-surgical toilet and suturing, analgesia and tetanus toxoid

\section*{B.RIBS}

Usually fracture. Types of rib fracture include:
1) Simple fracture
2) Compound fracture
3) Multiple fractures-many ribs or rib plus sternal fracture. May or may not cause Flail chest
4) Flail chest

\section*{C.PLEURA}

Pleural injuries also involves lung parenchyma

\section*{Hemothorax}

Classified according to the amount of blood:
1.Minimal, 350 mL
2.Moderate, $350-1500 \mathrm{~mL}$;
3. Massive, 1500 mL or more.
-Rate of bleeding after evacuation of the hemothorax even more important. If air is also present, the condition is called hemopneumothorax
-Hemothorax should be suspected with penetrating or severe blunt thoracic injury.
-Clinically-Reduced chest movements, dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds
-CXR (upright or semiupright, ) should be promptly obtained.
-Tube thoracostomy using one or two large-bore pleural catheters should be performed promptly
In 85\% of cases, tube thoracostomy and circulatory support are the only treatment required.
-If bleeding is persistent, as noted by continued output from the chest tubes, it is more likely to be from a systemic (eg, intercostal) rather than a pulmonary artery.

A portion of the chest wall becomes isolated by multiple fractures moves in and out with inspiration and expiration with severe reduction in ventilatory efficiency.
Is dangerous because of the paradoxical movement of the flail segment to the rest of the ribs cage and thus the area of the lung under it is not ventilated and may collapse.
Atelectasis, hypercapnia, hypoxia, accumulation of secretions, and ineffective cough occur.
Management options
Less severe cases, intercostal nerve block or continuous epidural analgesia may be adequate treatment otherwise
i)Hemi-thorax strapping

Pack with gauze and Strap 3-4 ribs in hemi thorax fashion
ii)Positive pressure ventilation

Sedate patient and do the positive pressure ventilation
iii) Tracheostomy

This reduces the work of breathing by reduction of dead space and thus reduces the paradoxical movement of the flail segment. Give humidified oxygen.
iv) Thoracotomy and ORIF

Drill two holes in each rib and hold using wire.

In most cases, the chest wall is the source of hemorrhage, but the lung, heart, pericardium, and great vessels account for 15-25\%.
Indication for thoracotomy
1. Initail drainage of fluid $>1500 \mathrm{~L}$ and still draining
2.Draiange rate $>200 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$ for 3 or more hours

\section*{Pneumothorax}

Types
1.Open pneumothorax
2.Closed
3.Tension
-Lacerations of the lung or chest wall following penetrating or blunt chest trauma. Prompt occlusive dressing should be done for open pneumothorax before tube insertion.
-Hyperinflation (eg, blast injuries, diving accidents) can also rupture the lungs. After penetrating injury, $80 \%$ of patients with pneumothorax also have blood in the pleural cavity.
-Tension pneumothorax develops when a flap-valve leak allows air to enter the pleural space but prevents its escape; intrapleural pressure rises causing total collapse of the lung and a shift of the mediastinal viscera to the opposite side.
-It must be relieved immediately to avoid interference with ventilation in the opposite lung and impairment of cardiac function.
NB For any impaled or penetrating objects still on the chest should left in situ until the patient is in theatre.
Bandage and stabilize the object to avoid further injury.

\section*{Heart and Pericardium:}
-The injury varies from localized contusion to cardiac rupture.
-Early clinical findings include friction rubs, chest pain, tachycardia, murmurs, dysrhythmias, or signs of low cardiac output.
-ECGs show nonspecific ST and T wave changes. Serial tracings should be obtained, since abnormalities s may not appear for 24 hours.
-Hemopericardium may occur without tamponade and can be treated by pericardiocentesis. Tamponade in blunt cardiac trauma is often due to myocardial rupture or coronary artery laceration.
-Cardiac Tamponade produces
- Distended neck veins
- Muffled heart sounds
- Shock
- Cyanosis.
-Immediate thoracotomy and control of the injury are indicated.
-Treatment of injuries to the valves, papillary muscles, and septum must be individualized; when tolerated, delayed repair is usually recommended.
-Pericardial lacerations from stab wounds tend to seal and cause tamponade, whereas gunshot wounds leave a sufficient pericardial opening for drainage. -Gunshot wounds produce more extensive myocardial damage multiple perforations, and massive bleeding into the pleural space.
Hemothorax, shock, and exsanguination occur in nearly all cases of cardiac gunshot wounds.
-Treatment of penetrating cardiac injuries has gradually changed from initial management by pericardiocentesis to prompt thoracotomy and pericardial decompression.
-Pericardiocentesis is reserved for selected cases when the diagnosis is uncertain or in preparation for thoracotomy. The myocardial laceration is closed with sutures

\section*{Diaphragm}
-Penetrating injuries of the diaphragm outnumber blunt diaphragmatic injuries by at least 4:1.
-Wounds of the diaphragm must not be overlooked, because they rarely heal spontaneously and because herniation of abdominal viscera into the chest can occur either immediately or years after the injuries.

\section*{Indications for thoracotomy}
1.Cardicac tamponade
2. Initial drain through the chest tube $>1.5 \mathrm{~L}$ and continuing
3.Hourly drain $>200 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$ for more than 3 hours
2.Electro cardiac dissociation
3. Intraabdomial bleeding in excess indicating a thoraco-abdominal injury
4. Persistent pneumothorax even with adequate drainage suggesting injury to trachea or bronchi. Confirmed by bronchoscopy
5 Diaphragmatic injury
6.Large Chest wall defects
7.High velocity injuries
8.Impaled objects on the chest in situ
9.Trans mediastinal injury
9.Delayed indications Clotted hemothorax, Lung abscess or fistula formation. 10. Failure of resuscitation measures

Trachea and Bronchus:
-Blunt tracheobronchial injuries are often due to compression of the airway between the sternum and the vertebral column in decelerating injury
-Patients present with
- Pneumothorax or hemopneumothorax
- Subcutaneous emphysema
- Cervicofacial emphysema
- Pneumo mediastinum
- Hemoptysis.
-Suspected with massive air leak or when the lung does not readily re-expand after chest tube placement
-In penetrating injuries of the trachea or main bronchi, there is usually massive hemorrhage and hemoptysis.
-Systemic air embolism resulting in cardiopulmonary arrest may occur if a bronchovenous fistula is present.
-Diagnosis may require tracheobronchoscopy. Primary repair is indicated for tracheobronchial lacerations.
Lung Injury
-Pulmonary contusion due to blunt or penetrating injuries.
-Alveolar rupture with fluid transudation and extravasation of blood are early findings. These enter alveolar spaces and bronchi and produce localized airway obstruction and atelectasis.
-Increased mucous secretions and overzealous intravenous fluid therapy may combine to produce copious secretions (wet lung) and further atelectasis.
-Blood oxygenation and pH drop and $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ rises.
-Treatment is often delayed because clinical and x-ray findings may not appear until 12-24 hours after injury.
-The clinical findings are loose, copious, blood-tinged secretions, chest pain, restlessness, apprehensiveness, and labored respirations.Eventually, dyspnea, cyanosis, tachypnea, and tachycardia develop.
- X-ray changes consist of patchy parenchymal opacification or diffuse linear peribronchial densities that may progress to diffuse opacification ("white-out").
- Mechanical ventilatory support permits adequate alveolar ventilation with oxygen.
-Most lung lacerations are caused by penetrating injuries, and hemopneumothorax is usually present. Tube thoracostomy is indicated to evacuate pleural air or blood and to monitor continuing leak

\section*{Esophagus:}
-Esophagus is well protected, and perforation from external penetrating trauma is relatively infrequent. Blunt injuries are very rare.
-Symptom of esophageal perforation is chest pain; fever develops within hours in most patients.
- Regurgitation of blood
- Hoarseness
- Dysphagia
- Respiratory distress may also be present.
-Physical findings include
- Shock
- Pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum
- Local tenderness
- Subcutaneous emphysema,
- Hamman's sign (ie, pericardial or mediastinal "crunch" synchronous with cardiac sounds)
- Leukocytosis occurs soon after injury.
-A nasogastric tube should be passed to evacuate gastric contents. If recognized within 24-48 hours of injury, the esophageal perforation should be closed and pleural drainage instituted with large-bore catheters.
-Illness and death are due topneumothoraxor mediastinum , mediastinal and pleural infection.

\section*{Thoracic Duct:}
-Chylothorax and chylopericardium are rare complications of trauma but, when they occur, are difficult to manage.
-Penetrating injuries of the neck, thorax, or upper abdomen can injure the thoracic duct or its major tributaries. The occurrence of chylothorax after a trivial injury should lead one to suspect underlying cancer.
-Chest tube drainage should be instituted if the effusion recurs. Intravenous hyperalimentation with no oral intake may be effective in persistent leaks.
-Three or 4 weeks of conservative treatment usually are curative.
- If daily chyle loss exceeds 1500 mL for 5 successive days or persists after 2-3 weeks of conservative treatment, the thoracic duct should be ligated via a right thoracotomy.

\section*{The sternum}
-These fractures are usually transverse and may overlap, causing agonizing pain.
- Internal fixation is required to correct deformity and relieve the discomfort of instability.
-This is performed by making an incision in the xiphisternum and passing a Steinmann pin up through the medulla of both sternum fragments from underneath.

\section*{B.SECONDARY SURVEY}

This is a second examination from the head to the toe while still monitoring the vital signs.
If any aspects of the $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{D}, \mathrm{E}$ deteriorates re-evaluate the patient for stabilization
-More common on the left hemi diaphragm as the right is protected by the liver.
Presentation
- Abdominal tenderness
- Dyspnea
- shoulder pain
- unilateral breath sounds
-CXR it is entirely normal in about $20 \%$ of cases. The most common finding is ipsilateral hemothorax.
-Once the diagnosis is made, immediate thoracotomy and the diaphragm
sutured with heavy nonabsorbable sutures. -In delayed diagnosis, when repair can not be done without tension Marlex mesh or a pericardial flap are employed.
-Because pulmonary complications are frequent; diaphragmatic injury should be approached through the abdomen when there is no other injury requiring thoracotomy.

\section*{UNDERWATER SEAL DRAINAGE (U.W.S.D)}

Indications
1) Fluid in the pleural space
2) Grater than $20 \%$ pneumothorax
3) Tension pneumothorax

Components of UWSD system
1.Chest tube
2.Bottle for fluid collection
3.Connecting tubes
4.Sealing fluid
5.-/+Suction mechanism

Types of collecting Bottles
1.Single Tubor Edwards Bottle system
2.Separate Reservoir and Seal
3.Three bottle system with controlled suction
4.Commercial system

Characteristics of good chest tube
1.Be transparent
2.Be flexible
3. Radio-opaque line in tube
4. Last tube hole goes through the radio-opaque line.
5.Must be graduated

Principles of under water seal drainage
1. Drainage of fluid influenced by gravity.
2. Drainage of air influenced by the pressure difference of the chest cavity and the UWSD system.
3.Thr return of air/fluid is prevented by the under water seal
3. The rate of fluid drainage is influenced level of seal under water

\section*{Insertion of a chest tube}
-Explain to the patient his condition and the need to have a chest tube inserted -Collect materials needed
UWSD system, sterilized drapes., Scalpel, Local anaesthetic, antiseptics, curved artery forceps, surgical gloves

\section*{Procedure}
1. Have patient lie lateral position with the side with pathology facing upwards.
2. Expose the whole chest wall and identify the intercostal space of insertion. Usually in the $4^{\text {th }}$ intercostal space just above the $5^{\text {th }}$ rib in triangle of safety (bordered anteriorly by anterior axillary line, posteriorly by mid axillary line and inferiorly by the upper border of fifth rib.
3. Clean the area with antiseptic and drape the patient leaving the identified intercostals space.
4. Infiltrate the skin, muscle and pleura with $1 \%$ lidocaine at the appropriate intercostal space.
Aspirate fluid from the chest cavity to confirm your diagnosis
5. Using a sterile scapel a small transverse incision just above the rib to avoid damaging the vessels under the lower part of the rib
6. Using a pair of large, curved artery forceps, do blunt dissection penetrating the pleura and enlarging the opening.
7. Using the same forceps to grasp the chest tube at its tip(clamped distally) and introduce it into the chest.
8. Advance the chest tube Posteriorly into the
costovertebral angle.(hemomthorax) or towards the apex for pneuamothorax.
9. Close the incision with interrupted skin sutures, using one stitch to anchor the tube.
Leave an additional suture untied adjacent to the tube for closing the wound after the tube is removed.
10. Apply dressing around the chest tube.
11. Remove the clamp and Connect the tube to the underwater-seal drainage system and mark the initial level of fluid in the drainage bottle.
12. Do a check x-ray to know the position of the chest tube

\section*{Management of chest tube in situ.}
1. Monitor the vital signs of the patient with his respiratory pattern.
2. Observe the UWSD system for the initial level, the nature of the drainage, the movement of the water seal up and down with respiration, the volume of initial drainage.
3. Observe for bubbling of air-continuous air bubbles in both expiration and inspiration may be sign of deep chest tube into the airway or the presence of brochopleuaral fistula
4. Secure the UWSD system in clearly lit area and protect it -in ward using a stool to avoid accidents.
5. Always keep the UWSD system at a level below the patient to facilitate drainage of fluid by gravity.
6. Chest drains should never be clamped except when changing drain bottles, whenever the chest drain bottle has to lifted above the level of the patients chest
7. Educate patient on the need to keep the chest tube secure and avoid turning or movements that would kink or dislodge the chest tube.
8. Encourage the patient to sit upright, take deep breaths and slight coughs to encourage drainage of fluid or gases from the pleural space
Chest physiotherapy is equally important
8. Continuously monitor the amount and nature of drainage- $>1.5 \mathrm{~L}$ of hemothorax and continuing or $>200 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$ for moe than 3 hrs are indications for thoracotomty.
9. Change the bottle every 24 hours noting the nature and volume of drainage which is noted as part of the output in the 24 hr input/output chart.
Establish original level of fluid in drainage bottle before reconnecting as this provides a baseline for future measurements. The fluid level should be clearly marked on the bottle either in the area provided or using a strip of tape
10. Use of prophylactic antibiotics especially in penetrating chest injuriescontaminated wounds.
Also give analgesics s appropriate.
11. Inspect the wound at point of chest tube insertion for exudates, discharges or signs infection and change dressing every 3 days.
12. Palpate area of chest wall around the chest tube for any crepitationsubcutaneuous emphysema.
13. Do regular respiratory examination for any features of distress, chest expansion, air entry bilaterally.
14.Do regular CXR to monitor the drainage of the hemothorax or pneumothorax and thus chest expansion

\section*{When to remove the chest tube}

When it has done its work of draining the hemothorax or pneumothorax.
This is assessed both
A)Clinically by respiratory examination
B) Radiologically by taking CXR
C)Drainage from the chest tube $50-100 \mathrm{ml} / 24 \mathrm{hrs}$

\section*{Removal of chest tube.}
1. Remove the dressing and clean the area with antiseptic.
2. Remove the suture securing the chest tube and ask the patient to deeply breath in and do valsalva manouvre.
3. Remove the chest tube while the assistant ties the purse string stitch around the chest opening.
Complications of chest tubes.
There is no organ in the thoracic or abdominal cavity that has not been pierced by a chest drain."

\section*{Acute complications (Poor technique)}
1. Haemothorax, usually from laceration of intercostal vessel (may require thoracotomy)
2. Lung laceration (pleural adhesions not broken down)
3. Diaphragm / Abdominal cavity penetration (placed too low)
4. Stomach / colon injury (diaphragmatic hernia not recognised)
5. Tube placed subcutaneously (not in thoracic cavity)
5. Tube placed too far (pain)
6. Tube falls out (not secured)

Late complications
1.Blocked tube (clot, lung)
2.Retained haemothorax
3.Empyema or sepsis
5.Pneumothorax after removal (poor technique)
