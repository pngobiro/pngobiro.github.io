                        <p>-Explain to the patient his condition and the need to have a chest tube inserted</p>
                        <p>-Collect materials needed</p>
                        <p>UWSD system, sterilized drapes., Scalpel, Local anaesthetic, antiseptics, curved artery forceps, surgical gloves</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Procedure</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Have patient lie lateral position with the side with pathology facing upwards.</li>
                            <li>Expose the whole chest wall and identify the intercostal space of insertion. Usually in the $4^{\text {th }}$ intercostal space just above the $5^{\text {th }}$ rib in triangle of safety (bordered anteriorly by anterior axillary line, posteriorly by mid axillary line and inferiorly by the upper border of fifth rib.</li>
                            <li>Clean the area with antiseptic and drape the patient leaving the identified intercostals space.</li>
                            <li>Infiltrate the skin, muscle and pleura with $1 \%$ lidocaine at the appropriate intercostal space.</li>
                            <li>Aspirate fluid from the chest cavity to confirm your diagnosis</li>
                            <li>Using a sterile scapel a small transverse incision just above the rib to avoid damaging the vessels under the lower part of the rib</li>
                            <li>Using a pair of large, curved artery forceps, do blunt dissection penetrating the pleura and enlarging the opening.</li>
                            <li>Using the same forceps to grasp the chest tube at its tip(clamped distally) and introduce it into the chest.</li>
                            <li>Advance the chest tube Posteriorly into the costovertebral angle.(hemomthorax) or towards the apex for pneuamothorax.</li>
                            <li>Close the incision with interrupted skin sutures, using one stitch to anchor the tube.</li>
                            <li>Leave an additional suture untied adjacent to the tube for closing the wound after the tube is removed.</li>
                            <li>Apply dressing around the chest tube.</li>
                            <li>Remove the clamp and Connect the tube to the underwater-seal drainage system and mark the initial level of fluid in the drainage bottle.</li>
                            <li>Do a check x-ray to know the position of the chest tube</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Management of chest tube in situ.</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Monitor the vital signs of the patient with his respiratory pattern.</li>
                            <li>Observe the UWSD system for the initial level, the nature of the drainage, the movement of the water seal up and down with respiration, the volume of initial drainage.</li>
                            <li>Observe for bubbling of air-continuous air bubbles in both expiration and inspiration may be sign of deep chest tube into the airway or the presence of brochopleuaral fistula</li>
                            <li>Secure the UWSD system in clearly lit area and protect it -in ward using a stool to avoid accidents.</li>
                            <li>Always keep the UWSD system at a level below the patient to facilitate drainage of fluid by gravity.</li>
                            <li>Chest drains should never be clamped except when changing drain bottles, whenever the chest drain bottle has to lifted above the level of the patients chest</li>
                            <li>Educate patient on the need to keep the chest tube secure and avoid turning or movements that would kink or dislodge the chest tube.</li>
                            <li>Encourage the patient to sit upright, take deep breaths and slight coughs to encourage drainage of fluid or gases from the pleural space</li>
                            <li>Chest physiotherapy is equally important</li>
                            <li>Continuously monitor the amount and nature of drainage- $>1.5 \mathrm{~L}$ of hemothorax and continuing or $>200 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$ for moe than 3 hrs are indications for thoracotomty.</li>
                            <li>Change the bottle every 24 hours noting the nature and volume of drainage which is noted as part of the output in the 24 hr input/output chart.</li>
                            <li>Establish original level of fluid in drainage bottle before reconnecting as this provides a baseline for future measurements. The fluid level should be clearly marked on the bottle either in the area provided or using a strip of tape</li>
                            <li>Use of prophylactic antibiotics especially in penetrating chest injuriescontaminated wounds.</li>
                            <li>Also give analgesics s appropriate.</li>
                            <li>Inspect the wound at point of chest tube insertion for exudates, discharges or signs infection and change dressing every 3 days.</li>
                            <li>Palpate area of chest wall around the chest tube for any crepitationsubcutaneuous emphysema.</li>
                            <li>Do regular respiratory examination for any features of distress, chest expansion, air entry bilaterally.</li>
                            <li>Do regular CXR to monitor the drainage of the hemothorax or pneumothorax and thus chest expansion</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">When to remove the chest tube</h2>
                        <p>When it has done its work of draining the hemothorax or pneumothorax.</p>
                        <p>This is assessed both</p>
                        <p>A)Clinically by respiratory examination</p>
                        <p>B) Radiologically by taking CXR</p>
                        <p>C)Drainage from the chest tube $50-100 \mathrm{ml} / 24 \mathrm{hrs}$</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Removal of chest tube.</h2>

                            <li>Remove the suture securing the chest tube and ask the patient to deeply breath in and do valsalva manouvre.</li>
                            <li>Remove the chest tube while the assistant ties the purse string stitch around the chest opening.</li>
