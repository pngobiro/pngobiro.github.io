Burn Injuries \& Its Management

\section*{BURNS}

Wounds caused by exposure to:
1. excessive heat
2. Chemicals
3. fire/steam
4. radiation
5. electricity

\title{
BURNS \\ Results in 10-20 thousand deaths annually Survival best at ages 15-45 Children, elderly, and diabetics Survival best burns cover less than 20\% of TBA
}

\section*{Thermal}

\section*{TYPES OF BURNS}
exposure to flame or a hot object

\section*{Chemical}
exposure to acid, alkali or organic substances

\section*{Electrical}
result from the conversion of electrical energy into heat. Extent of injury depends on the type of current, the pathway of flow, local tissue resistance, and duration of contact Radiation
result from radiant energy being transferred to the body resulting in production of cellular toxins

\section*{Chemical Burn}

\section*{FLUID SHIFT}

Occurs after initial vasoconstriction, then dilation
Blood vessels dilate and leak fluid into the interstitial space
Known as third spacing or capillary leak syndrome
Causes decreased blood volume and blood pressure
Occurs within the first 12 hours after the burn and can continue to up to 36 hours

\section*{FLUID IMBALANCES}

Occur as a result of fluid shift and cell damage
Hypovolemia
Metabolic acidosis
Hyperkalemia
Hyponatremia
Hemoconcentration (elevated blood osmolarity, hematocrit/hemoglobin) due to dehydration

\section*{FLUID REMOBILIZATION}

Occurs after 24 hours
Capillary leak stops
See diuretic stage where edema fluid shifts from the interstitial spaces into the vascular space
Blood volume increases leading to increased renal blood flow and diuresis Body weight returns to normal See Hypokalemia

CURLING'S ULCER
Acute ulcerative gastro duodenal disease Occur within 24 hours after burn Due to reduced GI blood flow and mucosal damage
Treat clients with H2 blockers, mucoprotectants, and early enteral nutrition Watch for sudden drop in hemoglobin

\section*{PHASES OF BURN INJURIES \\ Emergent (24-48 hrs)}

Acute
Rehabilitative
*ImmenamERGENT PHASE reduced blood flow (fluid and electrolyte shifts)
Goals:
1. secure airway
2. support circulation by fluid replacement
3. keep the client comfortable with analgesics
4. prevent infection through wound care
5. maintain body temperature
6. provide emotional support

Knowledge of EMERGENT PHASE surrounding the burn injury
Obtain client's pre-burn weight (dry weight) to calculate fluid rates
Calculations based on weight obtained after fluid replacement is started are not accurate because of water-induced weight gain Height is important in determining body surface area (BSA) which is used to calculate nutritional needs
Know client's health history because the physiologic stress seen with a burn can make a latent disease process develop symptoms

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS.IN THE}

\section*{EMERGENT PHASE}

Clients with major burn injuries and with inhalation injury are at risk for respiratory problems
Inhalation injuries are present in 20\% to 50\% of the clients admitted to burn centers
Assess the respiratory system by inspecting the mouth, nose, and pharynx
Burns of the lips, face, ears, neck, eyelids, eyebrows, and eyelashes are strong indicators that an inhalation injury may be present
Change in respiratory pattern may indicate a pulmonary injury. The client may: become progressively hoarse, develop a brassy cough, drool or have difficulty swallowing, produce expiratory sounds that include audible wheezes, crowing, and stridor Upper airway edema and inhalation injury are most common in the trachea and mainstem bronchi
Auscultate these areas for wheezes
If wheezes disappear, this indicates impending airway obstruction and demands immediate intubation

\section*{CLINICAL}

Changes in renal function are related to decreased renal blood flow Urine is usually highly concentrated and has a high specific gravity
Urine output is decreased during the first 24 hours of the emergent phase Fluid resuscitation is provided at the rate needed to maintain adult urine output at 30 to $50-\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{hr}$.
Measure BUN, creat and Na levels

\section*{CLINICAL}

Sympathetic stimulation during the emergent phase causes reduced GI motility and paralytic ileus
Auscultate the abdomen to assess bowel sounds which may be reduced Monitor for $\mathrm{n} / \mathrm{v}$ and abdominal distention Clients with burns of 25\% TBSA or who are intubated generally require a NG tube inserted to prevent aspiration and removal of gastric secretions

\section*{IV FLUID THERAPY}

OInfusion of IV fluids is needed to maintain sufficient blood volume for normal CO
${ }^{\text {O}}$ Clients with burns involving 15\% to 20\% of the TBSA require IV fluid
OPurpose is to prevent shock by maintaining adequate circulating blood fluid volume
OSevere burn requires large fluid loads in a short time to maintain blood flow to vital organs
OFluid replacement formulas are calculated from the time of injury and not from the time of arrival at the hospital
ODiuretics should not be given to increase urine output. Change the amount and rate of fluid administration. Diuretics do not increase CO; they actually decrease circulating volume and CO by pulling fluid from the circulating blood volume to enhance diuresis

\section*{SKIN ASSESSMENT}

Assess the skin to determine the size and depth of burn injury The size of the injury is first estimated in comparison to the total body surface area (TBSA). For example, a burn that involves 40\% of the TBSA is a 40\% burn Use the rule of nines for clients whose weights are in normal proportion to their heights

COMMON FLUIDS
Protenate or $5 \%$ albumın in isotonic saline ( $1 / 2$ given in first $8 \mathrm{hr} ; 1 / 2$ given in next 16 hr ) LR (Lactate Ringer) without dextrose ( $1 / 2$ given in first $8 \mathrm{hr} ; 1 / 2$ given in next 16 hr ) Crystalloid (hypertonic saline) adjust to maintain urine output at $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{hr}$ Crystalloid only (lactated ringers)

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSIS IN THE Decreased CO Deficient fluid volume r/t active fluid volume loss \\ Ineffective Tissue perfusion Ineffective breathing pattern}

\section*{ACUTE PHASE OF BURN}

\section*{INIURY}
- Lasts until wound closure is complete
- Care is directed toward continued assessment and maintenance of the cardiovascular and respiratory system
- Pneumonia is a concern which can result in respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation
- Infection (Topical antibiotics - Silvadene)
- Tetanus toxoid
- Weight daily without dressings or splints and compare to pre-burn weight
- A $2 \%$ loss of body weight indicates a mild deficit
- A 10\% or greater weight loss requires modification of calorie intake
- Monitor for signs of infection

LAB VALUES
Na - hyponatremia or Hypernatrem
K - Hyperkalemia or Hypokalemia
WBC - 10,000-20,000

NURSING DIAGOSIS IN THE ACUTE PHASE
}

\author{
Impaired skin integrity Risk for infection Imbalanced nutrition Impaired physical mobility Disturbed body image
}

PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION Nonsurgical management: removal of exudates and necrotic tissue, cleaning the area, stimulating granulation and revascularization and applying dressings. Debridement may be needed

\section*{DRESSING THE BURN}

\section*{WOUND}

After burn wounds are cleaned and debrided, topical antibiotics are reapplied to prevent infection
Standard wound dressings are multiple layers of gauze applied over the topical agents on the burn wound

\section*{REHABILITATIVE PHASE OF BURN INJURY}

Started at the time of admission
Technically begins with wound closure and ends when the client returns to the highest possible level of functioning
Provide psychosocial support Assess home environment, financial resources, medical equipment, prosthetic rehab
Health teaching should include symptoms of infection, drugs regimens, f/u appointments, comfort measures to reduce pruritus

Initially NPO
Begin oral fluids after bowel sounds return Do not give ice chips or free water lead to electrolyte imbalance High protein, high calorie

\section*{DEBRIDEMENT}

Done with forceps and curved scissor or through hydrotherapy (application of water for treatment)
Only loose eschar removed Blisters are left alone to serve as a protector controversial

SKIN GRAFTS
Done during the acute phase Used for full-thickness and deep partialthickness wounds

\section*{POST CARE OF SKIN GRAFTS}

Maintain dressing
Use aseptic technique
Graft should look pink if it has taken after 5 days
Skeletal traction may be used to prevent contractures
Elastic bandages may be applied for 6 mo to 1 year to prevent hypertrophic scarring

\section*{Heat Stroke}

\section*{Leads to organ failure and death}

Mortality rate up to 80\% 2 types:
Exertional
Sudden onset
Too heavy clothes
Classic
Occurs over period of time
Chronic exposure to heat

HYPOTHERMIA

\section*{COLD}
-Most common
- Hypothermia
- Frostbite
- Synthetic clothing is best because it wicks away moisture and dries fast
-"cotton kills" it holds moisture and promotes frostbite
$>$ A hat is essential to prevent heat loss though head
- Keep water, extra clothing, and food in car in case of break down

\section*{Hypothermia}
- Internal core temperate is $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or less - Elderly, infants, persons with concurrent illness, the homeless, and trauma victims are at risk

\section*{Rabies Virus}

The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, ultimately causing disease in the brain and death
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_22_a3f21f3f0b8bf4332938g-076.jpg?height=715&width=846&top_left_y=835&top_left_x=1262)

\section*{Transmission}

The virus is typically transmitted by being deposited under the skin, usually through a bite wound.
Contamination of a pre-existing wound is possible but unlikely because the local inflammatory reaction which follows a wound, quickly seals the comprised skin and prevents entry of the virus.
Transmission across mucous membranes is also possible, but less likely than a bite wound.

\section*{Aberrant Routes of Transmission}

A small number of human rabies cases have been reported following corneal transplants.
This suggests that human rabies cases may be underreported.
Aerosol (airborne) transmission of the virus has also been reported. However, this is possible only under unusual circumstances.
Persons have contracted rabies presumably by airborne transmission after visiting bat caves (Frio Cave, Texas.)

\section*{Survivability of the Rabies Virus}

\section*{The rabies virus is}

\section*{extremely short lived}

\section*{under most environmental}

\section*{conditions.}

It is easily inactivated by heat and drying.
Capable of surviving for a few days in cold temperatures.
Thorough and
immediate waching of

\section*{course of a Rabies Infection}

\section*{Once introduced, the rabies virus travels}
retrograde up the nerves to the spinal cord eventually reaching the brain.

\section*{Viral Spreading in Animals}

In cats and dogs, the clinical symptoms usually begin before the virus is found in the saliva.
Sometimes virus can be found one to three days before clinical symptoms in cats and three to five days in dogs. Ferrets is something < 10 days.

No reliable information regarding the appearance of virus in the saliva is available for other animal species .
There is some evidence that certain wildlife species, like skunks and bats, may excrete virus in their saliva for long periods before becoming ill.

\section*{Terrestrial Reservoirs of Rabies}

Different terrestrial (non-bat) mammalian species are the rabies reservoirs in different parts of the country.
Strains in the USA include - skunk, raccoon, fox, and coyote. For a given strain, only transmission within the host species is sufficiently successful to maintain the disease from year to year.
This was observed before monoclonal antibody testing revealed that distinctly different strains of the virus were involved.

The vast majority of rabies cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) each year occur in wild animals like raccoons, skunks, bats and foxes

-The rabies virus is transmitted through saliva or brain/nervous system tissue. You can only get rabies by coming in contact with these specific bodily excretions and tissues
-Rabies is transmitted only when the virus is introduced into a bite wound, open cuts in skin, or onto mucous membranes such as the mouth or eyes

\section*{Bite}
- Any penetration of the skin by teeth constitutes a bite exposure

\section*{Nonbite}
- The contamination of open wounds, abrasions, mucous membranes or, theoretically, scratches (potentially contaminated with infectious material from a rabid animal) constitutes a nonbite exposure

\section*{This is the period of time from the exposure to rabies virus until the animal finally becomes sick and/or acts differently and is capable of infecting other animals or people}

The incubation period can be as short as two weeks or in very rare cases as long as one year

\section*{People who work with rabies in laboratory settings and animal control and wildlife officers are just a few of the people who should consider rabies preexposure vaccinations}

If you are traveling to a country where rabies is widespread, you should consult your doctor about the possibility of receiving pre-exposure vaccination against rabies

\section*{Pre-Exposure Vaccination}

Consider pre-exposure vaccination if: Your planned activity will bring you into contact with wild or domestic animals, for example if you are a biologist, veterinarian, or agriculture specialist working with animals You will be visiting remote areas where medical care is difficult to obtain or may be delayed, for example, hiking through remote villages where dogs are common
Your stay is longer than 1 month in an area where dog rabies is common; the longer your stay, the greater the chance of an encounter with an animal

or 28

\section*{Continuous Risk}

\section*{People who work with rabies virus in research laboratories or vaccine production facilities are at the highest risk for unapparent exposures}

Such persons should have a serum sample tested for rabies antibody every six months; Intramuscular booster doses of vaccine should be administered to maintain a serum titer corresponding to at least complete neutralization at a $1: 5$ serum dilution by the RFFIT (Rapid

Fluorescent Focus Inhibition Test for rabies)

\section*{Frequent Risk}

This group includes other laboratory workers such as those performing rabies diagnostic testing, spelunkers, veterinarians and staff, and animalcontrol and wildlife officers in areas where animal rabies is enzootic as well as persons who frequently handle bats, regardless of location in the United

States

\section*{Booster Doses}

\section*{Frequent Risk}

Persons in the frequent risk group should have a serum sample tested for rabies antibody every 2 years; if the titer is less than complete neutralization at a 1:5 serum dilution by the RFFIT, the person also should receive a single booster dose of vaccine

\section*{Infrequent risk}

Veterinarians, veterinary students, and terrestrial animal-control and wildlife officers working in areas where rabies is uncommon to rare (infrequent exposure group) and at-risk international travelers fall into this category and do not require preexposure booster doses of vaccine after completion of primary pre-exposure vaccination

\section*{Management}

The first aid being currently recommended is based around the mnemonic: "Do it R.I.G.H.T."
R =Reassure the patient. 70\% of all snakebites are from nonvenomous species. Only 50\% of bites by venomous species actually envenomate the patient.

I = Immobilise in the same way as a fractured limb. Use bandages or cloth to hold the splints, not to block the blood supply or apply pressure. Do not apply any compression in the form of tight ligatures, they can be dangerous!
G.H. = Get to Hospital Immediately. Traditional remedies have NO PROVEN benefit in treating snakebite.
$\mathbf{T}=$ Tell the doctor of any systemic symptoms such as ptosis that manifest on the way to hospital.

OAvoid venomous snakes as pets
OBe cautious in areas that harbour snakes like tall grass, rock piles, ledges, crevices, caaves, swamps
ODon protective attire like boots, heavy pants and leather gloves. Use a walking stick
OInspect areas before placing hands or feet in them
ODo not harass snakes....striking distance is the length of the snake
OSnakes can bite even 20-60 minutes after death due to bite reflex
OUse caution when transporting snake with victim to hospital...make sure it is in a sealed container.

Scorpions

There are more than 1250 species of scorpions.
About 100 species are found in India Eight legged arthropods, have a hollow sting in the last joint of their tail
Venom is clear, colourless
toxalbumen,and can be classified as either neurotoxic or haemolytic.

Introduction
Toxicity is more than snake but only small quantity is injected. Venom is potent autonomic stimulator resulting in the release of massive amount of

DROWNING

\section*{Near Drownina}

\section*{QUICK FACTS}
- Drowning is the second-leading cause of injury-related death for children ages 1 through 14. In 2000, 943 children died from drowning.
- Most drownings among children ages 1 to 4 occur in residential pools. Sixty-five percent of drowning cases happen in a child's tamily pool.
- A child can drown in the time it takes to answer a phone. Infants and toddlers can drown in 5-gallon buckets.
- The time it takes in which brain damage or death can occur varies with the temperature of the water. A natural biological mechanism triggered by contact with extremely cold water enhances survival during submersion. Known as the mammalian diving reflex, it is especially powerful among children.

\section*{POOL PRECAUTIONS}
- Install a four-sided fence with self-closing and self-latching gates around the pool. The fence should be at least 4 feet tall and separate the pool from the house and play area of the yard.
- Prevent children from having direct access to a swimming pool.
- Install a telephone near the pool. Know how to contact local emergency medical services. Post the emergency number, 911 , in an easy-to-see place.
- Learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation. CPR involves clearing the air passages to the lungs and massaging the heart by creating pressure on the chest.

Rip currents are powerful currents of water moving away from shore.
More people die every year from rip currents than from shark attacks, tornadoes, lightning or hurricanes.

According to the United States Lifesaving Association, 80 percent of surf beach rescues are attributed to rip currents, and more than 100 people die annually from drowning when they are unable to escape a rip current.

Rip currents can attain speeds as high as 8 feet per second Some rip currents last for a few hours; others are permanent.

Rip currents range from 50 to 100 feet or more in width. They can extend up to 1000 feet offshore.

If caught in a rip current: -Remain calm to conserve energy and think clearly. - Never fight against the current.
-Think of it like a treadmill that cannot be turned off, which you need to step to

6,000 to 8,000 people drown in the U.S. each year. Most drownings occur within a short distance of safety. Immediate action and first aid can prevent death.
A person who is drowning usually can NOT shout for help. Be alert for signs of drowning.
Suspect an accident if you see someone in the water fully clothed. Watch for uneven swimming motions, which indicate a swimmer is getting tired. Often the body sinks, and only the head shows above the water. Children can drown in only a few inches of water. It may be possible to revive a drowning victim even after a prolonged period of submersion, especially if the person was in very cold water.

\section*{First Aid}

\section*{When someone is drowning:}

Extend a long pole or branch to the person, or use a throw rope attached to a buoyant object, such as a life ring or life jacket. Toss it to the person, then pull him or her to shore.
People who have fallen through ice may not be able to grasp objects within their reach or hold on while being pulled to safety.
Do not place yourself in danger. Do NOT get into the water or go out onto ice unless your are absolutely sure it is safe.
If you are trained in rescuing people, do so immediately if you are absolutely sure it will not cause you harm.
If the victim's breathing has stopped, begin rescue breaths as soon as you can. This often means starting the breathing process while still in the water.
Continue to breathe for the person every few seconds while moving them to dry land. Once on land, give CPR if needed.

O Always use caution when moving a drowning victim.
- Assume that the person may have a neck or spine injury, and
avoid turning or bending the neck.
OKeep the head and neck very still during CPR and while moving the person.

O You can tape the head to a backboard or stretcher, or secure the neck by placing rolled towels or other objects around it.
OFollow these additional steps:
OKeep the person calm and still. Seek medical help immediately.
ORemove any cold, wet clothes from the person and cover with something warm to prevent hypothermia.

O Give first aid for any other serious injuries.
OThe person may cough and have difficulty breathing once breathing re-starts. Keep Reassuring the person without providing false hope.

DO NOT go out on the ice to rescue a drowning person that you can reach with your arm or an extended object.
DO NOT attempt a swimming rescue yourself unless you are trained in water rescue.
DO NOT go into rough or turbulent water that may endanger you.
Do not perform the Heimlich maneuver unless repeated attempts to position the airway to use rescue breathes failed and you suspect the person's airway is blocked. It increases the chances that an unconscious victim will vomit and subsequently choke
When to Contact a Medical Professional
If you cannot rescue the drowning person without endangering yourself, call for emergency medical assistance immediately. If you are trained and able to rescue the person, do so and then call for medical help.
All possible drownings should be checked by a doctor.

Avoid drinking alcohol whenever swimming or boating.
Observe water safety rules.
Take a water safety course.
Never allow children to swim alone or unsupervised regardless of their ability to swim.
Never leave children alone for any period of time, or let them leave your line of sight around any pool or body of water.
Drowning can occur in any container of water. Do not leave any standing water (in empty basins, buckets, ice chests, kiddy pools, or bathtubs). Secure the toilet seat cover with a child safety device.
Fence all pools and spas. Secure all the doors to the outside, and install pool and door alarms.
If your child is missing, check the pool immediately.

OWound Care Treatment (at Site)
Bleeding can usually be stopped by applying direct pressure to the wound.
Very large foreign objects stuck in a wound should be stabilized.
Do hot remove them.
All wounds require immediate thorough cleansing with fresh tap water.
Gently scrub the wound with soap and water to remove foreign Material. If a syringe is available, it should be used to provide high-pressure irrigation.
Remove dead tissue from the wound with a sterile scissors or scalpel.
After cleaning the wound, a topical antibiotic ointment (bacitracin) should be applied 3 times per day.
Wounded extremities should be immobilized and elevated. Puncture wounds are usually not sutured (stitched) unless they involve the face.

If the wound is clean, the edges can be drawn together with tape.
(Do not cover wounds inflicted by animals or that occurred in seawater with tape.) Oral antibiotics are usually recommended to prevent infection.
If infection develops, continue antibiotics for at least 5 days after all signs of infection have cleared.
Inform the doctor of any drug allergy prior to starting any antibiotic
Some may cause sensitivity to the sun, so sunscreen (at least SPF 15) is mandatory while taking these antibiotics. Pain may be relieved with Tylenol or ibuprofen

\section*{In Hospital Treatment}

Stay Safe. If you are not the victim, practice Universal precautions and wear PPE.

Try to control bleeding before anything else.
Putting pressure directly on the puncture wound while holding it above the level of the heart for 15 minutes should be enough to stop bleeding.
Avoid Tourniquets unless medical care will be delayed for several hours.
Call 911 if any Deep puncture wounds (or those of unknown depth) to the abdomen, back, pelvis, thigh, chest, or if bleeding will not stop

Holes in the chest can collapse the lungs
Deep puncture wounds to the chest should be immediately sealed by hand or with a dressing that does not allow air to flow ( 3 sided).

IF complaints of SOB occur or victim gets worse after sealing the chest puncture wound then unseal it.
Once bleeding has been controlled, wash the puncture wound with warm water and mild soap

\section*{SEXUAL ABUSE}

Sexual Abuse
Osexuarabuse (also referred to as motestation) is defined as the forcing of undesired sexual acts by one person to another.
OIncest is defined as sexual abuse between family members
${ }^{O}$ Different types of sexual abuse involve:
- Non-consensual, forced physical sexual behavior
- Psychological forms of abuse, such as verbal, sexual behavior, or stalking
- The use of a position of trust for sexual purposes.

OAcquaintance rape - forced sexual intercourse between individuals who know each other.
Usually related to drinking

\section*{The doctor in the emergency room will examine the victim for injuries and collect evidence. \\ The attacker may have left behind pieces of evidence such as clothing fibers, hairs, saliva or semen that may help identify him.}

In most hospitals, a "rape kit" is used to help collect evidence. Samples of evidence may be used in court.
blood tests are done to check for pregnancy and diseases that can be passed through sex.
Cultures of the cervix may be sent to a lab to check for disease, too. The results will come back in several days or a few weeks.

Follow up with PCP is important. If any of the tests are positive, treatment options will be discussed.
