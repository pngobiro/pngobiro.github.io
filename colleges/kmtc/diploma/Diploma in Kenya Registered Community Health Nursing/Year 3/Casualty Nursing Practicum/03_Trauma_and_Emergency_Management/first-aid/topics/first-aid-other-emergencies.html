                        <h2 class="section-heading">QUICK FACTS</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Drowning is the second-leading cause of injury-related death for children ages 1 through 14. In 2000, 943 children died from drowning.</li>
                            <li>Most drownings among children ages 1 to 4 occur in residential pools. Sixty-five percent of drowning cases happen in a child's tamily pool.</li>
                            <li>A child can drown in the time it takes to answer a phone. Infants and toddlers can drown in 5-gallon buckets.</li>
                            <li>The time it takes in which brain damage or death can occur varies with the temperature of the water. A natural biological mechanism triggered by contact with extremely cold water enhances survival during submersion. Known as the mammalian diving reflex, it is especially powerful among children.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">POOL PRECAUTIONS</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Install a four-sided fence with self-closing and self-latching gates around the pool. The fence should be at least 4 feet tall and separate the pool from the house and play area of the yard.</li>
                            <li>Prevent children from having direct access to a swimming pool.</li>
                            <li>Install a telephone near the pool. Know how to contact local emergency medical services. Post the emergency number, 911 , in an easy-to-see place.</li>
                            <li>Learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation. CPR involves clearing the air passages to the lungs and massaging the heart by creating pressure on the chest.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Rip currents are powerful currents of water moving away from shore.</p>
                        <p>More people die every year from rip currents than from shark attacks, tornadoes, lightning or hurricanes.</p>

                        <p>According to the United States Lifesaving Association, 80 percent of surf beach rescues are attributed to rip currents, and more than 100 people die annually from drowning when they are unable to escape a rip current.</p>

                        <p>Rip currents can attain speeds as high as 8 feet per second Some rip currents last for a few hours; others are permanent.</p>

                        <p>Rip currents range from 50 to 100 feet or more in width. They can extend up to 1000 feet offshore.</p>

                        <p>If caught in a rip current: -Remain calm to conserve energy and think clearly. - Never fight against the current.</p>
                        <p>-Think of it like a treadmill that cannot be turned off, which you need to step to</p>

                        <p>6,000 to 8,000 people drown in the U.S. each year. Most drownings occur within a short distance of safety. Immediate action and first aid can prevent death.</p>
                        <p>A person who is drowning usually can NOT shout for help. Be alert for signs of drowning.</p>
                        <p>Suspect an accident if you see someone in the water fully clothed. Watch for uneven swimming motions, which indicate a swimmer is getting tired. Often the body sinks, and only the head shows above the water. Children can drown in only a few inches of water. It may be possible to revive a drowning victim even after a prolonged period of submersion, especially if the person was in very cold water.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">First Aid</h2>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">When someone is drowning:</h2>
                        <p>Extend a long pole or branch to the person, or use a throw rope attached to a buoyant object, such as a life ring or life jacket. Toss it to the person, then pull him or her to shore.</p>
                        <p>People who have fallen through ice may not be able to grasp objects within their reach or hold on while being pulled to safety.</p>
                        <p>Do not place yourself in danger. Do NOT get into the water or go out onto ice unless your are absolutely sure it is safe.</p>
                        <p>If you are trained in rescuing people, do so immediately if you are absolutely sure it will not cause you harm.</p>
                        <p>If the victim's breathing has stopped, begin rescue breaths as soon as you can. This often means starting the breathing process while still in the water.</p>
                        <p>Continue to breathe for the person every few seconds while moving them to dry land. Once on land, give CPR if needed.</p>

                        <p>O Always use caution when moving a drowning victim.</p>
                        <p>- Assume that the person may have a neck or spine injury, and avoid turning or bending the neck.</p>
                        <p>OKeep the head and neck very still during CPR and while moving the person.</p>

                        <p>O You can tape the head to a backboard or stretcher, or secure the neck by placing rolled towels or other objects around it.</p>
                        <p>OFollow these additional steps:</p>
                        <p>OKeep the person calm and still. Seek medical help immediately.</p>
                        <p>ORemove any cold, wet clothes from the person and cover with something warm to prevent hypothermia.</p>

                        <p>O Give first aid for any other serious injuries.</p>
                        <p>OThe person may cough and have difficulty breathing once breathing re-starts. Keep Reassuring the person without providing false hope.</p>

                        <p>DO NOT go out on the ice to rescue a drowning person that you can reach with your arm or an extended object.</p>
                        <p>DO NOT attempt a swimming rescue yourself unless you are trained in water rescue.</p>
                        <p>DO NOT go into rough or turbulent water that may endanger you.</p>
                        <p>Do not perform the Heimlich maneuver unless repeated attempts to position the airway to use rescue breathes failed and you suspect the person's airway is blocked. It increases the chances that an unconscious victim will vomit and subsequently choke</p>
                        <p>When to Contact a Medical Professional</p>
                        <p>If you cannot rescue the drowning person without endangering yourself, call for emergency medical assistance immediately. If you are trained and able to rescue the person, do so and then call for medical help.</p>
                        <p>All possible drownings should be checked by a doctor.</p>

                        <p>Avoid drinking alcohol whenever swimming or boating.</p>
                        <p>Observe water safety rules.</p>
                        <p>Take a water safety course.</p>
                        <p>Never allow children to swim alone or unsupervised regardless of their ability to swim.</p>
                        <p>Never leave children alone for any period of time, or let them leave your line of sight around any pool or body of water.</p>
                        <p>Drowning can occur in any container of water. Do not leave any standing water (in empty basins, buckets, ice chests, kiddy pools, or bathtubs). Secure the toilet seat cover with a child safety device.</p>
                        <p>Fence all pools and spas. Secure all the doors to the outside, and install pool and door alarms.</p>
                        <p>If your child is missing, check the pool immediately.</p>
