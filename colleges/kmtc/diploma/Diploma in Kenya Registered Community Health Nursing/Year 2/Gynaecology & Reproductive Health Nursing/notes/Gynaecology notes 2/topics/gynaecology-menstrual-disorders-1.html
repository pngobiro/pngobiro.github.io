                        <h3>Amenorrhea</h3>
                        <p>It means absence of menstruation.
                        It may be physiological (before puberty, in pregnancy, during lactation or in menopause) or pathological.
                        It could also be classified as primary or secondary.</p>

                        <h4>Primary amenorrhea</h4>
                        <p>This is delayed menarche. It is when a young woman over 17 years has not yet began to menstruate but shows signs of sexual maturation.</p>

                        <h4>Pathological primary amenorrhea</h4>
                        <p>This when a patient has never menstruated, and has not developed secondary sexual characteristics</p>

                        <h4>Main factors that cause primary amenorrhea</h4>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text">Hormonal factors(malfunctioning of the pituitary gland)</span></li>

                        </ol>

                        <h4>Secondary amenorrhea</h4>
                        <p>Occurs after a normal menarche and usually ceases for more than 6 months after having once appeared.</p>
                        <p>The most common causes are pregnancy, lactation and emotional upset related to being away from home like attending college or tension from work.</p>
                        <p>Typical pathological amenorrhea may fall under the following two categories;</p>
                        <h5>(a) False amenorrhea (crypto menorrhea)</h5>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">*</span><span class="item-text">This refers to when the flow does not escape out because of some obstruction commonly imperforate hymen (developmental abnormality).</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">*</span><span class="item-text">In this case, the girl experiences all the feelings and discomforts of menstrual flow. There is actual menstruation and blood accumulates behind the hymen. When not treated, the uterus distends leading to a condition known as Haematometra.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">*</span><span class="item-text">The girl may present with abdominal pains and the absences of menstruation.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">*</span><span class="item-text">Treatment is incision of the hymen</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">*</span><span class="item-text">Advice the girl to maintain high standards of hygiene i.e. to clean vulva three times a day after incision until healed</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>(b) True amenorrhea</h5>
                        <p>This occurs when the endometrial cycle is absent. This comes as a result of failure of the uterus or ovaries to develop or after hysterectomy, irradiation or pituitary disorder.</p>
                        
                        <h4>True pathological amenorrhea</h4>
                        <p>Causes includes;</p>
                        <h5>1) Uterine disorders</h5>
                        <p>Uterus may be congenitally deformed whereby you may find vaginal and uterine atresias which are present with primary amenorrhea. The endometrium atrophies after irradiation with X-rays or radium. Hysterectomy is an obvious cause of amenorrhea.</p>
                        <h5>2) Ovarian disorders</h5>
                        <p>Ovaries fail to develop in some cases of gonado dysgenesis/females in whom gonads are only presented by "fibrous streaks". Breast development, axillary and pubic hair is absent.
                        In some cases the ovaries are enlarged containing multiple follicular cysts with hyperplasia of theca interna leading to a disorder known as stein levanthal syndrome. After some period of normal menstrual period, it stops and the patient develops features of a man.
                        Excision of the ovaries may also lead to amenorrhea</p>
                        <h5>3) Pituitary disorders or hormonal imbalance</h5>
                        <p>There is failure of production of gonadotrophic hormones which will lead to;</p>
                        <h6>i. Pituitary infantilism (a person grows up looking like a child/Levi-Loraine syndrome)</h6>
                        <p>Rx: administration of growth hormone</p>
                        <h6>ii. Pituitary cachexia/Sheehan's disease</h6>
                        <p>It comes as a result of severe PPH and can lead to hypopituitarism. In this condition, there is temporary deprivation of blood supply to the pituitary gland leading to ischemia. This impairs the function of the pituitary gland.</p>
                        
                        <h5>4) Nervous disorders</h5>
                        <p>Any stress can act on the hypothalamus to inhibit FSH & LH releasing hormones secretion leading to stress/hypothalamic amenorrhea. Other minor emotional upsets related to being away from home especially in adolescents can lead to amenorrhea.
                        It also occurs with long standing psychiatric disorders especially depression or anxiety and anorexia nervosa.
                        Pseudo pregnancy is also another cause.
                        Also stress due to exercises e.g. marathon runners can result to exercise amenorrhea.</p>
                        
                        <h5>5) Dietary amenorrhea</h5>
                        <p>Loss of weight due to fasting will affect the hypothalamic function in ways not clearly understood. Also nutritional deficiency may also lead too amenorrhea.</p>
                        <h5>6) Drugs</h5>
                        <p>Contraceptive may lead to post contraceptive amenorrhea and in some women it may take 3-6 moths before the return of menstruation. This is because contraception suppresses ovulation.</p>
                        <p>Other drugs like phenothiazines and hypotensives agents may lead to prolactimia. These drugs stimulate production of prolactin which suppresses ovulation.</p>
                        <h5>7) Systemic diseases (debilitating systemic disease)</h5>
                        <p>Chronic ill health that cause general ill health such as Tuberculosis, other endocrine diseases like severe cases of hyperthyroidism, Myoxoedema, Cretinism and some cases of Diabetes, Addison's disease and Cushing syndrome.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Note:</h4>
                        <p>The commonest cause of secondary amenorrhea is most always pregnancy. Therefore an obstetrician and gynecological history is important in making a diagnosis.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Management</h4>

                        <h5>1. Clomiphene citrate (Clomid)</h5>
                        <p>If ovulation is the problem it can be induced using Clomiphene citrate. This drug should be restricted to those individuals requiring pregnancy. It acts on the graafian follicles. It can also be used in adolescents who have an ovulatory bleeding in an attempt to establish regular ovulatory circles.</p>
                        <p>Dosage- 50 mg daily initially for 5 days. Ovulation expected 5-11 days following discontinuation.
                        If no response dosage is gradually increased up to 200 mg .NB: AFTERovulation has been established clomid should be given from the $5^{\text {th }}$ day of the cycle for a total of 6 cycles including three ovulatory cycles.</p>

                        <p>It is a preparation of FSH & LH extracted from Human Menopausal Urine and available in the ratio of 1:1
                        HMG is for follicular ripening; it acts like LH and induces ovulation from a ripe follicle.</p>
                        <h6>Indication</h6>
                        <p>When there is failure to ovulate even after Clomid has been used for 6-12 months
                        Dosage: 375 units daily increasing progressively up to 1500 units daily
                        <strong>Note:</strong> Hormonal monitoring should be done to maintain the hormones in balance.</p>
                        <h5>3. Bromocrptine</h5>
                        <p>It is effective as an ovulatory agent in most patients with hyperprolactimia from a neoplastic source. It acts by suppressing the central and peripheral concentrations of prolactin, allowing for restitution of ovulatory function by stimulating production of estrogen and progesterone.</p>
                        <p>Initial dose is 2.5 mg nocte up to 4 weeks</p>
                        <p>It should be stopped if there is evidence of ovulation</p>

                        <p>This refers to painful menstruation. The pain is related to increased prostaglandins which peak at onset of menstrual flow causing spasms that result to ischemia.</p>
                        <p>Some women experience pain and discomfort and many may learn to live with it, in others the pain is severe enough to make the woman seek treatment.</p>

                        <h5>1) Analgesic is given in full doses.</h5>
                        <p>If prostaglandins theory is correct, the most effective drug will be those that inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins. Such drugs are all antipyretics and analgesic and they include;</p>

                        <h5>2) Ovulation inhibitors to decrease prostaglandins activity ( contraceptive pills)</h5>
                        <p>Pills inhibit ovulation resulting in painless periods. This is used in small number of girls when simple measures fail.
                        They should be placed on the pill for 4-6 month continuously after which the problem may disappear completely. This is achieved by high progesterone and oestrogen combined pill e.g. micronovular which has got ethynil oestral of 0.05 mg and norethisterone acetate of 1 mg .</p>
                        <h5>3) Beta receptor stimulators</h5>

                        They are the most effective of all, although the dose required brings about a lot of side effects.
                        They inhibit prostaglandins syntheses hence have been proved experimentally to abolish uterine contractions and ischemia and the pain which accompany them.</p>

                        The cause is not known
                        It can be treated with progesterone only</p>

                        <p>It is caused by acquired lesions some pathology in the pelvis. It occurs after some years of painless menstruation.
                        The patient usually complains of a dull aching pain in the lower abdomen</p>
                        <p>The pain commonly begins 3-4 days (or sometimes up to 10 days) prior to menstruation and ceases after the flow is established or may persist through out the period.
                        The pain is often made worse by exercise</p>
