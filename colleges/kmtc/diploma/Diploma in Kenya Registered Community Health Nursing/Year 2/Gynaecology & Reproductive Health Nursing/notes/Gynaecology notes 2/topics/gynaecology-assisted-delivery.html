                        <p>Younge invented the basic idea for the vacuum extractor in 1706 when he used a glass suction cup. In 1849, Simpson designed the instrument, but at the time it was hardly used. In 1774 Mostron introduced the modern vacuum extractor. There are opinions about the value in assisting delivery by this method and it is rarely used these days.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This procedure is performed by a forceps which is an instrument that has two parts that cross each other like scissors and lock at the intersection. The lock may be of sliding type or of screw type. Each part consists of a handle, a lock, a shank and a blade. The blade is joined to the handle by a shank.
                        The blade has two curves, cephalic curve to fit the head, and pelvic curve that correspond with the curved axis of the pelvis. The length of the handles differ, so do the types of handles. There are several types of forceps including</p>
                        <p>Kielland's, Simpson's, Wrigley's, Neville-</p>
                        <p>Barne's, Haig-Fwerguson's, Milne-Murray and Diper forceps among others.</p>
                        <h4>Types of Forceps Delivery</h4>
                        <h5>Low Forceps</h5>
                        <p>Today the majority of forceps delivery is carried out when the foetal head is on the perineal floor whereby the internal rotation may have already occurred. This is called outlet forceps or low forceps delivery.</p>
                        <h5>Mid Forceps</h5>
                        <p>This is when the head is higher in the pelvis but engaged and the greater diameter has passed the inlet. This is known as mid forceps.</p>
                        <h5>High Forceps</h5>
                        <p>If the head is not engaged, the procedure is termed high forceps. This is an extremely difficult and dangerous operation. A caesarean section is usually preferred to mid/high forceps.</p>
                        <p>What conditions have to be present for a forceps delivery?</p>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>Positioning the Forceps</h4>
                        <p>The shanks are pressed backwards against the perineum and the handle should lock and lie in a horizontal position. If the handle does not lock, the blades should be removed and the position of the head re-examined.
                        The ordinary curved forceps, if correctly applied on the foetal head, results in the fenestrate, 'window' of the blade lying over the pariental eminence. The fingers of the right hand resting on the cheek, guide the tip of the blade.</p>
                        <h4>The Delivery Procedure</h4>
                        <p>Before applying traction, ascertain that the cervix is not nipped between the
                        foetal head an the forceps blade. Traction is applied during contractions, which should not exceed 15 seconds. Encourage the mother to push with every contraction. The lock on the handle should be loosened between contractions to reduce the skull pressure. Continuously heart. The direction of pull is altered as the head descends to follow the curve of birth canal. If the head is mid cavity the direction of the pull is outwards.
                        The blades lie in submento vertical while the biparietal diameter is grasped. As the head descends, the handles are gradually raised to about $45^{\circ}$ above the horizontal, and then episiotomy is performed through a stretched perineum. The head is then gently guided through the vulva until crowning takes place. The handles of the forceps should be in vertical position. After the head is properly crowned and ready for extension, the forceps are removed.
                        The face is delivered by manual extension of the head.</p>
                        <p>You should note that the forceps delivery poses several dangers both to the mother and baby.
                        In the case of the mother dangers arise from:</p>

                        <p>The Piper forceps is used electively as a substitute in case of failure of Mauriceau Smellie-Veit manoeuvre for delivery of the foetal head. The forceps are applied after delivery of the shoulder while the head is in the pelvis. The body and the arms are suspended with a towel.</p>
                        <p>The left blade is introduced in an upward direction along the foetal head. The same is done to apply the right forceps.
                        The forceps are locked in place and the position of the head is confirmed by palpation. An episiotomy is performed in case it had not been done earlier.
                        Traction is applied until the chin the mouth and nose emerge over the perineum. The forceps are removed and the mother is instructed to pant so that the head is delivered slowly.</p>

                        <h4>Classical Caesarean Section</h4>
                        <p>The incision is made directly into the wall of the body of the uterus. The procedure is rarely performed, its indications are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Gestation of less than 32 weeks (i.e before the lower segment has formed)</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>It is always performed through a midline incision.</p>
                        <h4>Extra Peritoneal Caesarean Section</h4>
                        <h5>Procedure</h5>
                        <p>Access to the lower uterine segment is secured by appropriate dissection of tissues around the bladder to by pass the peritoneal cavity and the baby is extracted. As the peritoneal cavity is not disturbed there is no risk of introducing infection from infected liquor or infection from the uterus. This was a popular procedure in the pre-antibiotic era but is now outdated.</p>
                        <h4>Caesarean Section Hysterectomy</h4>
                        <p>This is also known as Porro's Operation. The removal of the uterus follows after caesarean section, due to other conditions of the uterus; such as placenta accreta, multiple fibroid tumours of the uterus and so on. On rare occasions and in conjuction with other gynaecological disorders this operation may be used for sterilisation purposes.</p>
                        <h4>Elective Caesarean Section</h4>
                        <p>The decision to deliver by caesarean section is made during pregnancy before the onset of labour. Some reasons for this decision are absolute while others depend on combination of factors and the opinion of the obstetrician.</p>
                        <h4>Emergency Caesarean Section</h4>
                        <p>This operation is performed when adverse conditions develop during labour. The psychological preparation of the mother for the operation is of paramount importance. You should be prepared to deal with the different feelings of different mothers. An opportunity should be given to mothers to explore and express their feelings, be they fear, disappointment or frustration. This can be done in a group or individual counselling setting, where uncertainties and misunderstandings can be clarified. The nurse can be of great help acting as a mediator, fostering acceptance and sense of readiness to both the apprehensive mother and her partner</p>
                        <h4>Pre-Operative Care For Elective</h4>
                        <h4>Caesarean Section</h4>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>Unanticipated Caesarean Section</h4>
                        <p>In such a situation, the mother's anxiety will be high. Reassure the mother and explain the reasons for surgery. The procedure is the same as outlined for elective Caesarean but if food has been consumed, gastric lavage should be performed</p>
                        <h4>Post Operative Care</h4>
                        <p>This is the same care given to any woman who has undergone a major abdominal operation.</p>
                        <p>The mother should breast feed as soon as her condition permits. If for any reason she cannot breast feed, the breast should manually be expressed from the third day to prevent engorgement of the breasts. Four hourly vulva swabbing should be taken if the patient is confined to bed.
                        Remember that maternal mortality is four times greater than in normal labour. Elective sections
                        usually have lower mortality rates but emergency cases are usually at high risk, especially due to the use of anaesthesia.</p>
                        <p>Mothers who were in labour for a prolonged period are especially at risk of serious infection; so prophylactic antibiotics should always be used. A ruptured uterus is more rare here than in the lower segment section. All mothers with a caesarean section scar should be delivered in the hospital under vigilant observation.</p>
                        <p>The foetus is also at risk, given that respiratory problems may occur due to the anaesthesia.
                        Intracranial damage may occur as a result of improper care during the delivery of the foetal head, which has to be brought up from the pelvis or through the small uterine incision.
                        Obstetric emergencies may occur suddenly or may be due to poor management or negligence on the part of the skilled medical personnel. be vigilant in observations in an effort to avoid such emergencies. When they do happen, be ready to respond in order to save lives and reduce morbidity and mortality</p>
