\section*{Positions used for vaginal examinations}

There are four positions which are commonly used for V.E; each position has its own advantages and disadvantages.
1. Lateral position

Patient lies on her left side and draws up both knees. It is a comfortable position, easily assumed and the patient is exposed unduly. It permits/ allows thorough examination.
A tense or nervous patient may relax her abdominal muscles better in this position than dorsal position.

\section*{Indications}

Indicated for examination of;
- Vulva
- Vagina
- Rectum

\section*{2. Semi prone or Sims position}

Patient lies on the left side with the arm behind her and her knee drawn up slightly more than the left allowing a good view of external genitalia. It is useful for examining the cervix and the anterior vaginal wall.

\section*{Indications}
- Examination of vagina to rule out V.V.F
- Insertion of pessaries or vaginal pack
- Other vaginal treatment
3. Dorsal position

Patient lies on her back with knees flexed. It gives a good view of the vulva.

\section*{Indications}
- Indicated for examination of;
- Vulva
- Vagina
- Abdomen-palpation
- Bimanual examination (best and convenient position)
4. Lithotomy position

Patient lies on her back with the buttocks drawn at the edge of the table and the thighs abducted and flexed on the abdomen and kept in position by supports/stirrups.

If the examination is made under anesthesia, this position is the best because of much exposure. Patients do not like this position but it is routinely used in departments of genitor urinary medicine and obstetric.

\section*{Indications}
- Is indicated in operations of;
- Vagina
- Vulva
- Rectum
- Vaginal delivery

\section*{Vaginal examination}

In all vaginal examinations the bladder and rectum must be empty (procedure as in FP).
NB: V.E on the virgins should be done under GA.
Equipment
Trolley
- Speculum
- Sponge holding forceps
- Pads
- Swabs in a bowl
- Antiseptic solution(iodine)
- Disposable and surgical gloves
- Receiver for used swabs
- Rectal tray

\section*{Methods used}

Speculum and bimanual

\section*{1. Speculum}

There are two forms of speculum commonly in use
(a)Sims Speculum

It is designed to display Vescico vaginal fistulae. It consists of two concave blades of different sizes, with a handle connecting them.
(b)Cusco's or Bivalve Speculum

It consists of two blades fixed together by a hinge at the vulval end of the instrument. It gives an excellent view of the cervix, and when screwed open, remains steady in the vagina without being held.

\section*{2. Digital and Bimanual Examination}

This is useful in noting the position of the uterus, the size, shape and mobility. A healthy fallopian tube is not palpable but a thickened fallopian tube may be felt.

\section*{Rectal Examination}

This examination is useful especially in the carcinoma of the cervix. It is important to do VE and Rectal examination for it is possible to examine the parametrial celluler tissue more easily by rectal than by V.E Palpate the base of the broad ligament and utero sacro ligaments.

\section*{GYNAECOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AND ASSESSMENT}

It consists of:
1. History taking
2. Physical examination
3. Gynecological tests
4. Endoscopic examinations

\section*{Note;}

A health worker must find clues in patient's history and physical examination to help make the right diagnosis.
- The more thorough the history and physical examination, the better the chances of making an accurate diagnosis
- It may also be necessary to carry out some tests and investigations in order to come to the correct conclusion
- Before taking history, physical examination and carrying out investigations, you must create a conducive environment. This can be achieved by;
- Making the patient comfortable
- Ensuring adequate privacy
- Show the patient

\section*{I. History taking}

When taking history remember patient's privacy so that information obtained is for you and immediate medical personnel.
Place emphasis on patient's gynecological history, but also should not omit other histories.
The following outline is suggested for history taking:

\section*{Gynecological history taking and examination}

Before making any examination it is essential that a good and careful history is taken. The following outline is suggested:
(a) General history/personal data

This includes;
Name, age, marital status, address and level of education
(b) Obstetrics history

This includes;
1) Number of pregnancies and deliveries, type of delivery e.g. SVD, Vacuum, C/S. Note any abnormalities of pregnancy, labour and peuperium.
2) Note the number of children with their ages, birth weights and their conditions either alive or dead
3) Number of abortions(miscarriages), at what gestations did it occur, any complications and probable cause
Any termination of pregnancy, gestation and method used, and reason for the termination
(c) Menstrual History (usual menstrual cycle)

This includes;

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}

Age of menarche, regularity of the cycle, usual duration of bleeding and length of cycle, the information will be recorded as M.H 13, 5/28 REGULAR_or (LNMP). This means MENSES BEGAN AT AGE OF 13 YEARS, 5 BLEEDING DAYS and occurs after 28 DAYS.
Amount of blood flow, any clots, color
Any vaginal discharge, amount, odour, any itching and soreness of the vulva and duration of the discharge
(d) Sexual and Contraceptive History

Avoid judgmental attitude. This history should include;
1) Intercourse- inquire whether the vulva feels dry, any discomfort or pain (dyspareunia), and any post coital bleeding.
Incase of infertility inquire whether intercourse is normal, frequency and time in cycle.
2) Contraception-the use intra uterine device or oral contraceptives and even injectables may be particularly relevant because of their possible effect on menstruation. Their side effects includes;
Bleeding which can be Menorrhagia, Metrorrhagia or spotting and irregular or prolonged duration of use and when stopped.
(e) Previous Medical and Surgical History (Gynecological operations)

Details of any serious illness or operations with dates of admission, type of illness, type of operation, any type of treatment given, blood transfusion received, evacuation, dilatation and curettage done, hysterectomy and post operative outcome.

\section*{(f) Detailed history of present complains}

Allow the patient to tell it all, including the nature and duration of the problem.
For abnormal menstrual loss;
- Note the pattern of bleeding (regular or irregular), amount, and number of pads used or tampons used, passage of clots, and any pain associated with the loss.

\section*{Local specific history}

This includes;
- Pelvic pain, site, nature and relation to periods- Note anything that aggravates or relieves the pain
- Vaginal discharge- Note amount, color, odour, presence of blood (bleeding)
- Pruritis vulvae
- Mass
(g) Family history

This is occasionally of value. It includes common chronic diseases in the family e.g. diabetes, hypertension, epilepsy, cancer i.e. if a close relative died of cancer especially the mother, if she died of cancer of the breast , there are high chances that one of her daughters might die of the same and especially he $1^{\text {st }}$ born. Inquire also the number of children alive.

\section*{(h) Other Systems}

I quire about other systems to include;
- Bowel history: frequency, constipation or diarrhea, any pain when passing stool, anal sex, blood in stool, color whether bright or dark
- Urinary history (Micturation): Frequency, dysuria (any pain), urgency, incontinence(real or stress), haematuria, colour-dark green or dark yellow e.t.c. odour
- Hormonal history: e.g. thyrotoxicosis, exophosthalmos, voice
- Emotional problems: relation with husband or sexual partners, family, housing, occupational stress, any sign of depression or anxiety or emotional upset which is producing the symptoms.

\section*{Summary}

Gynecological history includes;
* Menstruation
* Gynecological operations
* Contraceptive history
* Sexual behavior

\section*{II. Physical Examination}

It includes;
1. General examination
2. Abdominal examination
3. Vaginal examination and pelvic examination

\section*{General Examination}
- The examination is not confined to the pelvic organs and the abdomen only. The patient should be considered as a whole, for it easy to miss other conditions i.e. carcinoma of the breast or intestinal tract with ovarian metastasis.
- A general examination provides more information about a client and also gives a clinician a chance to establish rapport with the patient.
- General examination usually includes; a check on vital signs and general condition of the patient
- During general examination you should look for:
- Development of secondary sexual characteristics
- Palpate breast for any masses
- Body hair distribution especially the pubic hair
- Hair on the chest and chin in a female means that she has more

Note
i. Breast examination, abdominal palpation and vaginal examination both digital and bimanual refer to FP and Midwifery.
ii. For abdominal examination, the bladder must be empty, the patient should lie flat and if the abdomen is rigid, she should draw up her knees to relax the muscles.

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
iii. On pelvic examination the patient in the best comfortable position. Lithotomy or Sims position for a patient who is too ill is advisable.
- Patient should be instructed to remain relaxed and always keep legs widely separated in order to facilitate examination.
- Drape the patient in order to avoid embarrassment The following equipments are necessary;
- Vaginal speculum(Cuscos and Sim's)
- Wooden spatula
- Dish with lotion
- Good source of light
- Cotton tipped applicators
- Sponge holding forceps
- Sterile swab for cleaning or swabbing
- Sterile gloves
- Lubricant
- Glass slides
- A fixative solution

The general examination consists of four techniques;
(a) Inspection
(b) Palpation
(c) Percussion
(d) Auscultation

\section*{Inspection}

On inspection, note the size and shape of the abdomen.
$\checkmark$ Fullness in the midline may indicate a uterine or ovarian tumor
$\checkmark$ Fullness in the flanks may occur in ascites
Observe the condition of the skin for;
- Linea nigra
- Rashes
- Pigmentation
- Scars

\section*{Palpation}
$\checkmark$ The abdomen should always be examined with a warm hand and with the flat of the hand rather then the tips of the fingers, as deep palpation can then be done without hurting the patient.
$\checkmark$ If abdominal rigidity is encountered, it must be determined whether $t$ is due to nervousness/tension or is true rigidity of the muscles. Abdominal guarding due to pain may be from some underlying spot-ectopic.
$\checkmark$ Nervous/tension may be overcome by asking the patient to take deep breath with her mouth open or engaging her in conversation. If rigidity is true guarding, the abdominal muscles will neither relax nor move when the patient takes a deep breath.
$\checkmark$ If a tumor is felt, its position, size, shape, mobility and consistency is noted.
As a general rule midline tumors are of uterine or ovarian in origin.
- Tumors in either iliac fossa tend to arise from the ovary, tube or bowel /intestines. Malignant ovarian tumors or fibromyomata growing from the sides of the uterus because of adhesions may give rise to a swelling in the iliac fossa.
- Tumors arising from the pelvis if not fixed by adhesions are mobile from side to side but not up and down. It is not possible to feel the lower border of the tumor.
- Tumors may be solid or cystic, cystic tumors may be tense or flaccid or soft, flabby.
- Large cystic or solid tumors may exhibit a fluid thrill, felt with a flat hand when a cyst is tapped with the other hand.
- Ascites may also give a fluid thrill and its presence is confirmed by shifting dullness on percussion.
- Resonance in the midline is replaced by dullness when the patient turns on her side.
- If there is free fluid in the peritoneal cavity, dip down by sudden but gentle movements of the fingers to feel whether there is any solid growth lying more deeply.

\section*{Percussion}

It enables one to decide whether a swelling is in contact with the abdominal wall, and dull sound on percussion is heard or whether bowel intervenes( comes between) the tumor and the abdominal wall.

When there is free fluid, this is diagnosed when there is abdominal resonance in the centre and dull in the flanks and the dullness shifts when the patient changes her position.

\section*{Auscultation}

Bowel sounds and aortic pulsation are normal sounds heard on auscultation. A silent abdomen is an indication of intestinal paralysis due to generalized peritonitis and post -operative paralytic ileus.

Two additional sounds may be heard on auscultation over a tumor.
Uterine soufflé-is a soft blowing sound due to blood passing through the uterine arteries of the mother over the placental site. If a tumor is pregnancy or a large Fibromyomata, it will contain hypertrophied uterine vessels and a blowing sound will be heard which is synchronous (occurring at the same time) with the patients heart beat.

\section*{III. Investigations/diagnostic procedures}

This includes laboratory tests and radiological investigations as follows;
1) Urine for urinalysis- to check for colour, oduor, protein, glucose, microorganism and pregnancy test if indicated
2) Blood for- hemoglobin levels, full haemogram, widal test, brucellosis and VDRL
3) Urethral smears for- Neisseria Gonorrhea. HVS -for Candida albicans \& Trichomonas Vaginalis. Endocervical swabs for Gonorrhea. This is taken from urethra, vagina and cervix.
4) Dilatation and Curettage(D\&C)

Is a common gynecological procedure where the cervical canal is widened with a dilator and the uterine endometrium is scrapped with a curette for C/S and histology.

\section*{Indications}
a) To secure endometrial or Endocervical tissue for cytological examination
b) To control abnormal uterine bleeding
c) As a therapeutic measure for incomplete abortion

\section*{Note}
- It is carried out under GA but can also be carried out under local anesthesia/sedation
- Prepare the patient as for any surgical procedure even if she is under sedation. This to prepare for any complications that may arise during the procedure
5) Cytological tests/papnicolaus/pap smears/cervical smears
$\star$ It is an essential part of routine gynecological examination.
* Cervical smears are taken for exfoliative cytology- may be used in the follow up clinic to detect recurrences of a treated carcinoma.
$\star$ They are taken in FP clinics, antenatal clinics and in gynecological clinics at regular intervals.
$\star$ The $1^{\text {st }}$ two smears should not be taken more than 1 year a part in case a positive smear is missed on the $1^{\text {st }}$ occasion. There after smears to be taken not more than 3 years intervals.
$\star$ Positive findings for cytology and histology are more common after the age of 30 years and after child bearing age.
* Smears should also be taken in younger women who are having regular intercourse.
6) Cervical biopsy
$\star$ Is a test done to detect problems on the cervix. It may be done as an office procedure without anesthesia. The lesion is visualized by a colposcope and one or more punch biopsy may be taken. (A colposcope is a binocular inspection of the cervix with a magnification of up to 20times
* Patient is advised to rest after a biopsy for 24 hours and the packing is left insitu for recommended time 8-24 hours.
* Vital signs should be checked regularly
* Any excess bleeding reported
* Sexual intercourse should be delayed until the gynecologist indicates.
7) Endoscopic examinations
a) Pelvic endoscopy or culdoscopy
* An instrument called a colposcope is passed through an incision in the posterior vaginal fornix to visualize pelvic organs. The procedure is done in theatre patient positioned in knee chest position.
* It is commonly used to detect pelvic masses.
* Patient is prepared as for vaginal operation and may be under local anesthesia.
* It can visualize the fallopian tubes, uterus, ovaries, broad ligaments, utero-sacro ligaments and sigmoid.
b) Laparoscopy
- Indications are similar to those of culdoscopy but it has another advantage, it possible to perform minor operations like tubal ligation, ovarian biopsy and lysis (destruction) of peritubal adhesions.
- During this examination, a scope of about 10 mm in diameter is inserted into the peritoneal cavity through a 2 cm sub-umbilical incision to allow visualization of the pelvic structure.
- Some doctors may prefer D\&C before this procedure in order to permit easy manipulation of the uterus to afford better visualization.
- A better view of the pelvis, lower abdomen and visceral contents is also facilitated by injection of a prescribed amount of CO2 intra peritoneal into the cavity (insufflations). This separates the intestines from the pelvic organs.
- This procedure is performed under GA and therefore the patient has to be prepared pre-operatively.
- After the procedure the patient has to be observed carefully for several hours to detect any complications e.g. bleeding or burns from the coagulator.
- The observations includes; vital signs and signs of PV bleeding.
- Reassure the patient
- Discharge patient when vital signs become stable.
c) Hysteroscopy
* This procedure is indicated as a diagnostic measure only in complex situations e.g. infertility, unexplained bleeding and retained intra uterine contraceptive device.
* Hysteroscopy is used to visualize all the parts of the uterine cavity. This procedure is best performed about 5 days after completion of menstruation. This is because the fresh, new cells lining the uterine cavity can be studied properly in order to give accurate findings.
* It is contra-indicated in patients with cervical or endometrial carcinoma.
8) Radiographic diagnostic procedures

These includes: Straight X-rays, Barium enema, Intravenous Urography
a) Hysterosalphingogram(utero-tubogram)

This is an X-ray study of the uterus and uterine tubes after injection of a contrast medium. It is done to study sterility problems, tubal patency and or the presence of pathological conditions in the uterine cavity.
During preparation for this procedure;
$\checkmark$ The patient should be given enema the night before to evacuate intestinal tract.
$\checkmark$ Starve patient for at least 4-6 hours.

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
$\checkmark$ Give analgesics for comfort since some patients may experience nausea, vomiting, cramps and faintness.
$\checkmark$ Briefly explain the procedure and reassure the patient.
$\checkmark$ Take vital signs before and after the procedure.
$\checkmark$ Give patient food as soon as she can tolerate.
$\checkmark$ Provide patient with plenty of fluids to flush the urinary bladder.
b) C-T Scan (Computerized Tomography)

This scan is very sensitive and can reveal presence of cancer and its extension into the retroperitoneal lymph nodes and skeletal involvement.
* It has several advantages over an U/S. It is more effective especially in obese patients and/or patients with a distended bowel or stomach. This is because it penetrates deep into the organ targeted and reveals more information about that organ.
* Patients should be starved before this procedure.
c) Ultra sound

Commonly used and does not require any special preparation of the patient, except to ensure the patient has a full bladder. This is because a distended bladder usually pushes the uterus out of the pelvic cavity allowing it to be properly viewed.

Note: Privacy and confidentiality must be observed, at all times.

\section*{MENSTRUAL DISORDERS}

\section*{Amenorrhea}

It means absence of menstruation.
It may be physiological (before puberty, in pregnancy, during lactation or in menopause) or pathological.
It could also be classified as primary or secondary.

\section*{Primary amenorrhea}

This is delayed menarche. It is when a young woman over 17 years has not yet began to menstruate but shows signs of sexual maturation.

\section*{Pathological primary amenorrhea}

This when a patient has never menstruated, and has not developed secondary sexual characteristics

\section*{Main factors that cause primary amenorrhea}
1. Hormonal factors(malfunctioning of the pituitary gland)
2. Developmental abnormalities of the vagina, uterus and ovaries

\section*{Secondary amenorrhea}

Occurs after a normal menarche and usually ceases for more than 6 months after having once appeared.

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}

The most common causes are pregnancy, lactation and emotional upset related to being away from home like attending college or tension from work.

Typical pathological amenorrhea may fall under the following two categories;
(a) False amenorrhea (crypto menorrhea)
* This refers to when the flow does not escape out because of some obstruction commonly imperforate hymen (developmental abnormality).
* In this case, the girl experiences all the feelings and discomforts of menstrual flow. There is actual menstruation and blood accumulates behind the hymen. When not treated, the uterus distends leading to a condition known as Haematometra.
* The girl may present with abdominal pains and the absences of menstruation.
* Treatment is incision of the hymen
* Advice the girl to maintain high standards of hygiene i.e. to clean vulva three times a day after incision until healed
(b) True amenorrhea

This occurs when the endometrial cycle is absent. This comes as a result of failure of the uterus or ovaries to develop or after hysterectomy, irradiation or pituitary disorder.

\section*{True pathological amenorrhea}

Causes includes;
1) Uterine disorders

Uterus may be congenitally deformed whereby you may find vaginal and uterine atresias which are present with primary amenorrhea. The endometrium atrophies after irradiation with X-rays or radium. Hysterectomy is an obvious cause of amenorrhea.
2) Ovarian disorders

Ovaries fail to develop in some cases of gonado dysgenesis/females in whom gonads are only presented by "fibrous streaks". Breast development, axillary and pubic hair is absent.
In some cases the ovaries are enlarged containing multiple follicular cysts with hyperplasia of theca interna leading to a disorder known as stein levanthal syndrome. After some period of normal menstrual period, it stops and the patient develops features of a man.
Excision of the ovaries may also lead to amenorrhea
3) Pituitary disorders or hormonal imbalance

There is failure of production of gonadotrophic hormones which will lead to;
i. Pituitary infantilism (a person grows up looking like a child/Levi-Loraine syndrome)

Rx: administration of growth hormone
ii. Pituitary cachexia/Sheehan's disease

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}

It comes as a result of severe PPH and can lead to hypopituitarism. In this condition, there is temporary deprivation of blood supply to the pituitary gland leading to ischemia. This impairs the function of the pituitary gland.

\section*{4) Nervous disorders}

Any stress can act on the hypothalamus to inhibit FSH \& LH releasing hormones secretion leading to stress/hypothalamic amenorrhea. Other minor emotional upsets related to being away from home especially in adolescents can lead to amenorrhea.
It also occurs with long standing psychiatric disorders especially depression or anxiety and anorexia nervosa.
Pseudo pregnancy is also another cause.
Also stress due to exercises e.g. marathon runners can result to exercise amenorrhea.

\section*{5) Dietary amenorrhea}

Loss of weight due to fasting will affect the hypothalamic function in ways not clearly understood. Also nutritional deficiency may also lead too amenorrhea.
6) Drugs

Contraceptive may lead to post contraceptive amenorrhea and in some women it may take 3-6 moths before the return of menstruation. This is because contraception suppresses ovulation.

Other drugs like phenothiazines and hypotensives agents may lead to prolactimia. These drugs stimulate production of prolactin which suppresses ovulation.
7) Systemic diseases (debilitating systemic disease)

Chronic ill health that cause general ill health such as Tuberculosis, other endocrine diseases like severe cases of hyperthyroidism, Myoxoedema, Cretinism and some cases of Diabetes, Addison's disease and Cushing syndrome.

\section*{Note:}

The commonest cause of secondary amenorrhea is most always pregnancy. Therefore an obstetrician and gynecological history is important in making a diagnosis.

\section*{Management}
- $1^{\text {st }}$ consider general health of the patient including psychological and environmental factors.
- In the case of a young girl who appears normal on examination, it is usually better to wait until the $18{ }^{\text {th }}$ birth day. Meanwhile you can offer reassurance and health education on sexuality.
- Investigations include:
a) History taking

This is very important because a distinction must be made between primary and secondary amenorrhea, in order to start appropriate management measures. Some women have very infrequent and scanty bleeding; this may be considered as primary amenorrhea.

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
- If the patient is experiencing the physical disturbance of menstruation, without actually bleeding, a cyclical change in hormone level can be assumed and the cause of amenorrhea is likely to be in the genital tract.
b) Examination
- Pelvic examination is essential to exclude pregnancy or uterine hyperplasia. Note that in virgins it should be done under GA.
- A bimanual examination will reveal gross abnormalities such as crypto menorrhea.
- Inspect for secondary sex characteristics.
c) Radiological examinations
- It includes chest X-rays to rule out tuberculosis.
- Straight skull X-rays to detect enlargement of sella turcica (pituitary fossa)
d) Endocrine tests
- 24 hour urine collection to measure levels of different hormones
- Estimation of blood hormones levels, these are FSH, LH and Prolactin. If prolactin levels are high refer patient to an endocrinologist for pituitary tumor
e) Laparoscopy

To detect any developmental anomalies of the uterus, ovaries and tubes, an ovarian biopsy can also be carried out
f) Dilatation and curettage

Commonly performed in countries where tuberculosis is common. Presence of Acid Fast Bacilli I the endometrial cells or any other organism may be the cause of amenorrhea.
g) Others

Includes U/S and CT-Scan, also visual acuity

\section*{Medical treatment}

Depends on the cause, some drugs that may be used are;
1. Clomiphene citrate (Clomid)

If ovulation is the problem it can be induced using Clomiphene citrate. This drug should be restricted to those individuals requiring pregnancy. It acts on the graafian follicles. It can also be used in adolescents who have an ovulatory bleeding in an attempt to establish regular ovulatory circles.

Dosage- 50 mg daily initially for 5 days. Ovulation expected 5-11 days following discontinuation.
If no response dosage is gradually increased up to 200 mg .NB: AFTERovulation has been established clomid should be given from the $5^{\text {th }}$ day of the cycle for a total of 6 cycles including three ovulatory cycles.

\section*{Side effects}
$\star$ Hyper stimulation leading to enlargement of the ovaries
$\star$ Multiple gestation because more than one ovum may mature
* Abortions especially to those treated for infertility

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
* Dysmenorrheal because of failure to produce peri -ovulatory type of cervical mucus
* Tetralogy- a tendency to give birth to babies with congenital abnormalities
* Bloating nausea and vomiting
2. Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin (HMG) and Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin(HCG) (Proganol)

It is a preparation of FSH \& LH extracted from Human Menopausal Urine and available in the ratio of 1:1
HMG is for follicular ripening; it acts like LH and induces ovulation from a ripe follicle.

\section*{Indication}

When there is failure to ovulate even after Clomid has been used for 6-12 months
Dosage: 375 units daily increasing progressively up to 1500 units daily
Note: Hormonal monitoring should be done to maintain the hormones in balance.
3. Bromocrptine

It is effective as an ovulatory agent in most patients with hyperprolactimia from a neoplastic source. It acts by suppressing the central and peripheral concentrations of prolactin, allowing for restitution of ovulatory function by stimulating production of estrogen and progesterone.

Initial dose is 2.5 mg nocte up to 4 weeks

It should be stopped if there is evidence of ovulation
4. Other agents for ovulation induction
a. Gluco corticoid like Dexamethasone 0.5 mg nocte, Prednisone 0.75 mg
b. Oestradiol(estrogen preparations)

\section*{NOTE}

Emotional disturbance is always a cause of amenorrhea. Patients with amenorrhea need psychotherapy to relieve tension and stress, which may be noted through history taking.

\section*{Oligomenorrhea}

This is a type of amenorrhea where there is infrequent menstruation, which may occur months before menopause and at times due to emotional upset.

Treatment
Includes;
- Thorough investigations to exclude other serious conditions e.g. neoplasm's
- Reassurance if cause is emotional upset

\section*{Dysmenorrhea}

This refers to painful menstruation. The pain is related to increased prostaglandins which peak at onset of menstrual flow causing spasms that result to ischemia.

Some women experience pain and discomfort and many may learn to live with it, in others the pain is severe enough to make the woman seek treatment.

\section*{Types}

Primary and secondary Dysmenorrhea

\section*{Diagnosis}

Blood studies, U/S to rule out any underlying cause

\section*{Primary Dysmenorrhea}

\section*{Clinical features}
- Is a more common complain and usually starts soon after puberty, although the $1^{\text {st }}$ few cycles may have been painless.
- The pain starts at the begging of the periods and lasts from a few hors to 2 days.
- The pain is cramp like and felt in the pelvic and lower back region, and may radiate in to the legs. Severe pain is sometimes accompanied by nausea, vomiting and fainting. These reactions may encourage a woman to seek treatment.

The cause of Dysmenorrhea is not well known but several theories have been put forward, such as;
A. Dysmenorrheic uterine are hypoplastic but no evidence.
B. Endocrine abnormalities (imbalance) have also been postulated but not found.
C. Prostaglandins from disintegrating endometrium may cause uterine spasms (that is why increased concentration of $\mathrm{PGF}_{2}$ in menstrual fluids in case of Dysmenorrhea.
D. Psychological factors undoubtedly accentuate symptoms e.g. there may be fear of sexual or reproductive abnormalities resulting to uterine spasms.
E. It may also be caused by ischemia as the uterus contracts strongly enough to shut off its own circulation, the muscles lack $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ leading to pain. Child birth is thought to cure this condition since after the uterus has held a baby; it is more vascular and not easily ischemic.
F. Cervical Stenosis also seems to be associated with Dysmenorrhea especially if it disappears after the $1^{\text {st }}$ delivery.

\section*{Management}

NB: Unfortunately a spontaneous cure does not occur soon enough for most women.
Management includes;
* History taking with special reference to the severity and duration of pain
* Physical examination to exclude pelvic tumors
\$ A full and frank discussion of the normal cycle is an important part of treatment
* Share health message on importance of exercises, avoiding unnecessary restriction of activities
* Reassurance and support

NB
Patients tend to complain less as they grow older

\section*{Medical treatment}
1) Analgesic is given in full doses.

If prostaglandins theory is correct, the most effective drug will be those that inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins. Such drugs are all antipyretics and analgesic and they include;
a) Aspirin/Pacetamol 2 tabs tds widely used
b) Mefenamic Acid (Postan) 500 mg tds is also commonly used. It is said to prevent the action of prostaglandins in the muscles and also it inhibits its production.
c) Flufenamic acid (Arlef) and
d) Indomethacin
$\checkmark$ These two drugs must be used carefully as they can adversely affect patients with other medical conditions including asthma. They are usually prescribed for rheumatic pain but have been used with success in Dysmenorrhea.
$\checkmark$ Do not give strong analgesics like morphine and pethidine and other addictive drugs
2) Ovulation inhibitors to decrease prostaglandins activity ( contraceptive pills)

Pills inhibit ovulation resulting in painless periods. This is used in small number of girls when simple measures fail.
They should be placed on the pill for 4-6 month continuously after which the problem may disappear completely. This is achieved by high progesterone and oestrogen combined pill e.g. micronovular which has got ethynil oestral of 0.05 mg and norethisterone acetate of 1 mg .
3) Beta receptor stimulators

Includes; Rotridine, Salbutamol, Terbutaline
They are the most effective of all, although the dose required brings about a lot of side effects.
They inhibit prostaglandins syntheses hence have been proved experimentally to abolish uterine contractions and ischemia and the pain which accompany them.
4) Surgery

Pre-sacral neurecctomy may be offered as a last resort, it's rare.

\section*{Membranous Dysmenorrhea}

It a rare condition and is whereby the endometrium is cast off in at menstruation in large pieces or even the whole of it called "cast".
The cause is not known
It can be treated with progesterone only

\section*{Secondary or Congestive Dysmenorrhea}

It is caused by acquired lesions some pathology in the pelvis. It occurs after some years of painless menstruation.
The patient usually complains of a dull aching pain in the lower abdomen

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}

The pain commonly begins 3-4 days (or sometimes up to 10 days) prior to menstruation and ceases after the flow is established or may persist through out the period.
The pain is often made worse by exercise

\section*{NOTE}

Dysmenorrhea which starts after the age of 30 years should always be investigated since it could be due to some pathology in the reproductive system.

\section*{Causes}
* Chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
* Endometriosis
* Uterine fibroids
* Salphingitis
* Acute uterine retroversion

\section*{Note}

The common cause being chronic PID and is the most common cause of infertility too. Successful Treatment of PID is successful and so prevention should be emphasized.

\section*{Management}

Depends on the cause therefore;
$\star$ Take full history to find out the cause.
$\star$ Treatment the cause.
* It may spasmodic type due to uterine colic while expelling a clot.
* Laparoscopy may reveal early lesions of endometriosis that may not be palpable.

\section*{Premenstrual Tension Syndrome}

This is due to a large group of symptoms, which appear regularly and predictably about 12 days before the onset of menstruation.

This group of symptoms includes;
1) Those related to water retention leading to weight gain, painful breast, abdominal distention and feeling of bloatedness.
2) Backache, abdominal pains, headache, tiredness and muscle stiffness
3) Autonomic reactions-dizziness, fainting, cold sweats, nausea, vomiting and hot flushes
4) Mood changes- tension, irritability, depression and crying spells
5) Loss of concentration- forgetfulness, clumsiness, difficulty in making descions and poor sleeping patterns( insomnia)
6) Miscellaneous symptoms- feeling of suffocation, heart pumping, numbness and tingling.

The most common complains are;
Abdominal distention
Breast tenderness irritability
A desire to a void any activity, but, one symptom may dominate the other.

\section*{Cause/Etiology}

Fluid retention due to sudden rise in steroids hormones
Endocrine changes whereby there is progesterone deficiency
Post ovulatory hostility to men
Reaction of neurotic personality

\section*{Nursing diagnosis}

Pain related to PMS
Altered role performance related to pain
Altered nutrition related to anxiety, irritability and bloating

Treatment
$\checkmark$ Symptoms may be relieved by giving diuretics e.g. chlorothiazides in the pre-menstrual week
$\checkmark$ Oral contraceptives e.g. progestogens such as norethisterone 20 mg daily from the $15^{\text {th }}-25^{\text {th }}$ day of the cycle have been effective
$\checkmark$ Tranquilizers and psychotherapy also appear to be equally effective
$\checkmark$ Encourage exercises
$\checkmark$ Stress management
$\checkmark$ Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs
$\checkmark$ Diet low in simple sugars, caffeine and salt and increased protein, complex carbohydrates and vitamins
NB
Tell them the physiological changes that are producing these symptoms because they may think that they have a terrible disease.

This worry may increase the intensity of this symptom

\section*{Dysfunctional uterine bleeding}

This abnormal uterine bleeding due to hormonal imbalance (oestrogen progesterone variation in secretion), for reasons not known which is associated with un ovulatory periods.

DUB is diagnosed after excluding all the conditions that cause bleeding from the uterus. Such conditions to be excluded include;
- Infections
- Ruptured ectopic pregnancy
- Trauma
- Uterine fibroids \&polyps
- Genital cancers
- Hormonal treatment

\section*{Patterns of Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding}
1) Normal circle with excessive loss (Menorrhagia) common in women over 30 years or have had many children
2) Epimenorrhea
3) Metrorrhagia etc

\section*{Clinical features}

Complains of irregular bleeding, heavy bleeding or both

Diagnosis
- Trans vaginal U/S
- Hysteroscopy
- Dilatation and curettage for endometrial biopsy
- Hb \& haematocrit

\section*{Nursing diagnosis}
* Altered sexual patterns related to DUB
* Anxiety related to DUB as a possible sign of cancer
* Fatigue related to DUB induced anaemia

\section*{Management}
- If in Health center or clinic or dispensary, refer patient to hospital for investigations and management
- If patient is too sick due to excessive bleeding, then resuscitate and give intravenous fluids before referring
- In hospital a thorough history and physical examination should be done to exclude systemic diseases
- Blood examination to ascertain the cause
- Curettage to obtain specimen

\section*{Treatment}
$\checkmark$ Once diagnosis is certain treatment will improve the condition and if it fails irradiation or hysterectomy is done depending on the age of the patient and parity
$\checkmark$ Correct anemia if present depending on Hb levels
$\checkmark$ In teenage girls who have just started menstruating should be given a combination of estrogens and progesterone. This is a good option and treatment should be continued for 3-6 cycles. After treatment is stopped, menstruation often returns to normal.
$\checkmark$ For women in the reproductive age, true dysfunctional uterine bleeding is uncommon. The most common cause of abnormal bleeding at this age is some complications of pregnancy. Diagnostic curettage is needed and you must remember the possibility of malignant disease
$\checkmark$ In women over 40 years of age all the organic causes of bleeding including malignant disease may occur. Accurate history needs to be done and hysterectomy can be carried out
$\checkmark$ Ovulation stimulators can also be given to induce ovulation and restore a regular menstrual rhythm by use of Clomid citrate. It acts on the hypothalamus.

\section*{Menorrhagia}

This is a normal cycle but with heavy menstrual flow. The normal average volume of menstrual flow is approximately 70 mls .
- Menstrual loss is naturally greater in parous women or those over 30 years
- It is an important condition because the excessive bleeding results to anemia
- It is not a disease but a symptom and to treat it one must find out the actual cause
- The best way to mange this condition is to refer the patient for investigations and appropriate management

\section*{Common causes}
- Fibroids due to a larger endometrial cavity hence larger bleeding areas.
- Chronic PID
- Endometrial polyps
- Abnormalities in the blood clotting power e.g. leukemia, thrombocytopenia, purpura
- Abnormal hormonal state resulting $g$ to excessively thick endometrium which bleeds heavy when shed
- Emotional factors.
- Intra uterine contraceptive device

\section*{Management}
- Refer to hospital if in health center, dispensary or clinic
- History taking followed by pelvic examination.
- Investigations of blood for abnormalities, check Hb and Grouping and Cross Match
- D\&C under general anesthesia- this procedure may be curative if there is not any other abnormality
- The patient should be prepared pre and post operatively.
- Post operative care should be provided as any other surgical procedure.
- Older women can be better treated by hysterectomy (over 40 years)

NB: Treatment of the cause will cure the heavy blood loss and this is best done in an equip health facility.

\section*{Metrorrhagia}

This is menstrual bleeding lasting too long. It is caused by irregular shedding of the endometrium because the corpus luteum degenerates too slowly and the effects of progesterone persist- some secretory gland in the endometrium is still present early in the following circle.

\section*{Causes}
- Cancer of genital tract
- Uterine polyps projecting into the vagina
- Incomplete evacuation after abortion
- Hydatid form mole
- Chorion carcinoma
- Occasionally oral contraceptives- causing what is known as "Break through bleeding"

Management
- Detailed history to be taken
- Digital and speculum examination is necessary and also taking of Pap smear. Therefore refer patient to gynecologist.
- NB: never dismiss Metrorrhagia lightly. A thorough examination should be done

\section*{Epimenorrhea}

This is when normal menstruation occurs too often due to a shortened luteal phase by early degeneration of the corpus luteum.

\section*{Management}
- A detailed history to establish the cause
- Refer all patients with abnormal bleeding to hospital for investigations and treatment
- Treatment for young girls is a combination of oestrogen and progesterone pill for 3-6 cycles
- Iron supplements to help replace blood lost
- In women of reproductive age, diagnostic curettage is needed. Remember possibility of malignant disease
- Curettage may cure the condition, but if it does not give relief, then hysterectomy may be the best option leaving the ovaries intact

\section*{Hypomenorrhea}

In this condition, the periods occur on a regular basis but is minimal (scanty) e.g. a woman menstruating regularly 2-3 times in a year (very long cycles).

\section*{Endometriosis or Adenomysis}

In this condition, the endometrial tissue is in an abnormal situation, i.e. it is deposited in other organs of the body (out side uterine cavity), either at the ovary or on the utero sacral ligaments.

It is common between age 30 \& 40 especially in women who post phone child bearing.

\section*{Pathology}

The ectopic tissue consists of both glands and stroma in which cyclical menstrual changes occur.
Malignant changes are very rare.
The process where the endometrial tissue invades the myometrium is referred to as internal endometriosis or Adenomysis (the uterus is enlarged)
There is no difference clinically between Adenomysis and fibroids on feeling the uterus, but they are different hystologically
Endometriosis occurs only on tissues adjacent to the mullerian system (a pair of ducts in the female foetus which develop in to reproductive system).

The following are the common sites:
a. Ovaries

Small dark endometrial spots appear on the surface and the menstrual secretions badly distend the endometrial glands and partly enter the peritoneal cavity where it is walled off by adhesions. A tumor mass forms consisting of partly the ovary, and partly, fibrous tissue containing, chocolate colored blood The disease is usually bilateral and forms masses up to about 10 cm in diameter.
b. Uterus

The $2^{\text {nd }}$ place is the uterus- the endometrial tissue will invade the myometrium hence will have internal myometriosis. Nodules appear in the wall resembling fibromyomata except that they have no definite capsule and may show minute spaces containing blood. When examined microscopically they are endometrial tissues
c. Uterine tubes

It is a common site except in amputation cases
d. Recto-vaginal septum

Hard fixed mass of indefinite outlines and may extend backwards partially to surround the rectum which may cause ulceration of posterior phonix
e. Round ligaments both intra and extra peritoneal portions
f. Lower abdominal scars especially after hysterectomy and any where on the pelvic peritoneum.

The theories which explains the occurrence of endometriosis includes;
A. That it may be disseminated by means of lymphatic and vascular system, that is why endometrial tissue may be found in the umbilicus, forearm and thighs
B. It is also common in social groups where child bearing is delayed to late twenties or early thirties. This explains why it is rarely diagnosed before the age of 20 years and not apparent after menopause.

\section*{Clinical features}

Physical signs will depend on the site of the disease and they include;
- Chocolate cysts which are tender, fixed, bilateral masses resembling chronic Salphingitis or salphingo-oophritis but without history of any infection, fever or discharge
- Uterine lesions may cause nodular or uniform uterine enlargement and may be clinically indistinguishable from fibromyomata( benign tumor that consist of fibrous and muscle tissue) or diffuse hyperplasia
- Recto-vaginal lesions are tender, hard, fixed and simulate rectal carcinoma and causes dyspareunia
- Local lesions e.g. in scars may be tender at menstrual periods
- Dysmenorrhea occurs and any palpable tumor may be painful at the time of menstruation
- Menorrhagia and irregular bleeding occur from associated endometrial hyperplasia or from uterine lesions
- Infertility occurs in 30\% of the patients with endometriosis and this is due to pelvic adhesions or endometrial abnormalities
- Symptoms of intestinal obstruction may occur

\section*{Nursing diagnosis}
$\checkmark$ Chronic pain related to the pathological changes
$\checkmark$ Fatigue related to anemia
$\checkmark$ Stress/ineffective copping related to infertility

\section*{Management}
- Detailed history to elicit the symptoms of dysmenorrhea, Menorrhagia and dyspareunia
- It is rare to find abnormal findings on abdominal examination
- Refer patient to gynecologist
- On VE the uterus may be enlarged and tender(Adenomysis), areas around the ovaries are tender and chacteristically there is limited mobility of the uterus, a cyst is sometimes palpable in the either fornix
- Speculum exam may reveal typical areas of endometriosis in the cervix or vaginal vault
- A laparatomy is indicated when cystic swelling is felt or if you are in doubt of the diagnosis
- If patient is less than 40 years of age- surgical Rx is usually designed to destroy areas of endometriosis using a diathermy machine.
- Hormonal therapy should include progesterone steroids when confirmed. Administered either cyclically or continuously for 3-12 months. It suppresses the residual areas e.g. Damazole(Donacrine 200 mg tds)
- Pregnancy is another way of suppressing the condition, it often has accurate effects on endometriosis
- In older patients over 40 years of age hysterectomy (total abdominal hysterectomy)-removal of the uterus with the affected ovary since hormonal therapy is not always helpful at this age. WHY?

NB:
Young patients- conservative therapy with hormones
Old patients -TAH (Total Abdominal Hysterectomy)
Minor gynecological procedures are contraindicated immediately before or during menses-WHY?
A diathermy is used to lyses adhesions

\section*{Bleeding Disorders in Pregnancy}

Bleeding in pregnancy refers to any per vaginal bleeding during pregnancy.

These bleeding disorders are usually on the border line between obstetrics and gynecology, in that they involve women whose pregnancy come to a premature end.

The patients with bleeding disorders are always treated in gynecological ward rather than in the maternity ward.

Bleeding in pregnancy however slight should be taken seriously, because it is sometimes the 1 st sign of some of the most life threatening emergencies such as ruptured ectopic pregnancy and incomplete abortion.

\section*{Bleeding in early pregnancy}

Refers to any bleeding per vagina that occurs, before the $24{ }^{\text {th }}$ week of pregnancy

Causes
1. Abortion
2. Ectopic pregnancy Hydatid form mole
3. Chorion carcinoma

NOTE: Abortion is the commonest cause of bleeding in the early pregnancy and it accounts for 95\% of all bleeding at this period. The other causes accounts for only $5 \%$.

\section*{Abortion}

It is the expulsion of the foetus or termination of pregnancy before the $24{ }^{\text {th }}$ week gestation or before the foetus is viable.

NB- The definition generally accepted for a legal purpose is the delivery of the foetus at less than 20 weeks gestation or with fetal weight of less than 500 gms .
"What is the difference between abortion and miscarriage?"-They mean the same but the term abortion has been stigmatized to mean criminally induced abortion.

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}

\section*{Classification of Abortions}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_04_6b0d3cce57bf496412b2g-28.jpg?height=1329&width=1695&top_left_y=414&top_left_x=117)

\section*{Causes of Abortion}
1. Maternal causes

A account for $25 \%$ of known cases of abortions and they include:
- General disease like hypertension or chronic heart diseases
- A cute febrile conditions like malaria, acute pyelonephrites or pneumonia
- Endocrine disorders like thyrotoxicosis and poorly controlled Diabetes Mellitus
- Local conditions e.g. under developed uterus, fibroids, congenital abnormalities like septet uterus or biconuate uterus
- Cervical incompetence which would be due to;
- Congenital weakness of the cervix
-Trauma or lacerations of the cervix, from previous child bearing.
2. Foetal cause

Accounts for $75 \%$ of known cases of abortion and often results in $1{ }^{\text {st }}$ trimester abortions.
They include:
- Chromosomal or genetic abnormality
- Congenital malformation
- Exposure of the foetus to Viruses, chemicals and irradiation embryonic stage
- Abnormal attachment of the placenta as a result of blighted ovum leading to malformation of the trophoblast and poor implantation of the blastocyst resulting to placental separation, hypoxia and impaired embryonic development
3. Miscellaneous

It includes;
- accidents e.g. falls, injuries
- Criminal interference by use of drugs, herbs, plastic catheters and other instruments inserted into the cervical canal

NOTE
Ectopic pregnancy, APH, PROM and manual removal of the placenta occurs more commonly in pregnancy with an IUCD insitu. Therefore IUCD should be removed as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed

Signs and Symptoms
- Most abortions occur in the $1^{\text {st }} 3$ months of pregnancy before the placenta is mature.
- Vaginal bleeding due to partial separation or detachment of the embedded ovum
- Dilatation of the cervix when abortion is inevitable
- Expulsion of the foetus and its membranes

\section*{Point to note:}

Slight or moderate bleeding does not mean that the foetus is no longer a life. All must be done to save life at all times.

\section*{Types of Abortion}

\section*{1) Threatened Abortion}

Here disturbance to pregnancy is so slight that pregnancy may continue to term with good management. But also the damage may be progressive resulting to massive separation of the placenta and dilatation of the cervix.

\section*{Signs and symptoms}
* Slight per vaginal bleeding
* Slight lower abdominal cramps but no actual pain
* On speculum examination the cervical os is closed
* No part of pregnancy sac is expelled
* Common in the $1^{\text {st }} 20$ weeks of pregnancy

NB: VE is not usually done for fear of uterine disturbance.

\section*{Management}
- Bed rest
- Reassurance

To achieve the above, give phenobarbitone $30-60 \mathrm{mg}$ tds, morphine 10 mg or pethedine 100 mg . if pain is severe some doctors may use progesterone.
- If in health center give mild sedation as you transfer to the hospital
- Instruct patient to report if abdominal cramps become worse or the bleeding become heavy
- Instruct patient to save all the pads used and any tissue or clots that she may expel for examination
- Instruct and offer patient low residue diet and to avoid aperients or enema as this will stimulate contractions
- Advice her to stay in bed for 3 extra days after the bleeding stops
- To avoid heavy physical activity and sexual excitement for the remaining period of pregnancy Other nursing care
- Daily baths
- Vital signs frequency depending on the condition
- Vulval toilet
- Bladder care and urine tested for albumin and sugar
- Nutrition
- Iron supplements
- Oral hygiene

On discharge

\section*{Advice on;}
- Importance of adequate rest
- To avoid lifting heavy objects/loads, strenuous exercise, and intercourse for at least 1 month
- Importance of regular clinic attendance
- To come back incase of bleeding
- Good nutrition and low residue diet

\section*{2) Inevitable Abortion}

Inevitable or imminent means nothing else can be done. The pregnancy can not be saved and the fetus must come out.
* A good portion of the placenta has been detached and the cervical os is dilating.
* Vaginal bleeding is severe and some clots may even be passed.
* Backache and intermittent lower abdominal pain are intense.
* Incase where the uterus is palpable, strong uterine contractions may be felt abdominally.
$\star$ Incase where the membranes have ruptured, part of the products of conception may protrude through the dilating cervical os

This type of abortion may end up with one of the following;
a) Complete Abortion

That is the whole products of conception are expelled.
- After the expulsion of the conceptus, pain and vaginal bleeding decreases
- If the cervix is inspected it is found to be closed or closing, the uterus becomes smaller in size
- It is common before the $8^{\text {th }}$ week of pregnancy
b) Incomplete Abortion

It usually occurs in the $2^{\text {nd }}$ trimester. The foetus is expelled from the uterus but all or part of the placenta and membranes are retained. This is because the placenta is firmly embedded and the slender cord breaks easily.
- Bleeding continues after expulsion of the foetus and may be profuse because of the retained products of conception which will prevent efficient contraction and retraction of the uterus necessary to control the bleeding
- Pain and bleeding usually continues after the expulsion of the foetus
- Cervical os remains open and the uterus remains bulky
- If nothing is done immediately the patient loses a lot of blood and becomes shocked and anemic
- Blood pressure drops
- The pulse is weak and rapid
- Patient feels cold and clammy and is dyspneic

\section*{Management}
- Patients with incomplete abortion are usually brought with profuse PV bleeding and sometimes in shock

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
- Take history to determine if the products have been expelled
- If the blood loss is excessive, hasten the evacuation by administration of oxytoxic drugs e.g. inj. Ergometrine 0.5 mg or syntocinon 1 ml to expel uterine content and reduce bleeding from the placental site.
- Take blood for G\&M then put up a drip of plasma expanders or N/Saline or Hartman's solution to correct hypovolaemia
- Bleeding may continue after expulsion of the products of conception so give repeat Ergometrine 0.5 mg
- Save anything passed PV to inspect if all products of conception have been passed
- Strong analgesics like pethidine 100 mg may be given to relieve pain(severe pain can lead to shock)
- If patient is in shock or collapsed state, keep her warm and elevate the foot of the bed to keep vital centers supplied with blood
- Observe for PV bleeding
- If in health center and PV bleeding continues repeat Ergometrine or syntocinon after 10-20 minutes. Scrub your hands, clean patient vulva and make attempts to remove retained products by digital evacuation if not able refer, but midwife must accompany the patient with soiled articles for assessment of blood loss.
- Observation of vital signs $1 / 4$ hourly
- Consent
- Prepare patient for D\&C under G/A i.e. shaving, emptying of bladder, aspiration of stomach content, premedication

\section*{Nursing care after D\&C}
- Observe patient to exclude shock and PV bleeding
- Observe pulse and respirations $1 / 4$ hourly, BP $1 / 2$ hourly
- Monitor urinary output especially for patients who had severe haemorrhage to detect tubular necrosis of the kidneys manifested by oliguria.
- Stilboestral tabs 0.5 mg may be given tds for late abortions to suppress lactation.

\section*{Disadvantages of D\&C}
* Perforation of the uterus
* Cervical incompetence
* PID
$\star$ Infertility

\section*{3) Habitual Abortion/Recurrent Abortion}

This term is used when a mother has had three or more consecutive spontaneous abortions. The cause is not known but sometimes associated with cervical incompetence and the following conditions:
- Chronic maternal ill health e.g. diabetes, nephritis and tuberculosis
- Abnormalities of the uterus and the cervix

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
- Endocrine or genetic causes especially if it occurs before 14 weeks
- Infections e.g. syphilis

\section*{Clinical features of abortion due to cervical incompetence}
i) Abortion occurs late in the $2^{\text {nd }}$ trimester usually between $22^{\text {nd }}$ and $24^{\text {th }}$ weeks
ii) May occur without previous warnings like PV bleeding, membranes may rupture suddenly followed by expulsion of the products of conception
iii) The abortus looks fresh

\section*{Management}
- Take history and do physical examination to establish the cause and treat it
- Advice on proper diet rich in proteins vitamins, roughages to avoid straining and minerals, adequate rest, to avoid strenuous exercises, lifting heavy loads
- Avoid coitus during the rest of pregnancy
- Incases where the patient is unable to get enough rest at home -admit
- Surgical correction of obvious abnormalities of the genital tract like removal of myomas
- Repair of incompetent cervix- application of shirodkar stitch around the cervix at the level of the internal os at $14{ }^{\text {th }}-16{ }^{\text {th }}$ weeks of pregnancy
The suture is removed at 38 weeks or as soon as the mother goes in labour
- Let the mother know that there is danger of rupture of uterus if the sutures are not removed on time

\section*{4) Missed Abortion}

This term is used when abortion is threatened and then bleeding stops and all is well again i.e. pain and bleeding vanishes.

All other physiological signs of pregnancy will disappear, uterine enlargement will stop, breasts becomes soft, pregnancy test if done will be negative

Then after an interval of 4-8 weeks mother may experience some brownish discharge which is not associated with pain. This indicates that the fetus is dead but retained in utero. It then degenerates into a solid mass of organized blood clots called "Carneous Mole". This will in time be expelled with little or no loss and may be hastened by administration of ergot by mouth or Stilboestral.

Surgical evacuation may be necessary if it does not come out
If bleeding follow the expulsion of the conceptus, curettage should be done and administration of oxytoxic drugs.

\section*{5) Blood Mole /Carneous Mole}

It results from missed abortion in which the deciduas capsularis remains intact and permits the zygote to be surrounded by layers of blood. It usually forms before the $12{ }^{\text {th }}$ week.

If it is retained for a period of months, the fluid is extracted from the blood, the fleshy, firm, hard mass is called Carneous mole.

Management is like for missed abortion

\section*{6) Induced abortion}

This is the evacuation of products of conception from the uterus either by drugs or surgically.

\section*{Types}

\section*{a) Therapeutic}

This is an abortion that is performed under recommendation of a doctor in cooperation with the patient because of medical reasons

\section*{Medical indications for therapeutic abortion}

They are grouped under maternal conditions, fetal conditions, and non medical reasons
It is only performed under the following conditions;
1) If the continuation of pregnancy would severely threaten the life and health of the mother
2) If the will be born with gross congenital malformation
3) If the pregnancy was as a result of rape or incest
- Chance of infection here are very rare/limited because sterile instruments are being used
- Before the $12{ }^{\text {th }}$ week Manual Vacuum Aspiration is done
- After the $12{ }^{\text {th }}$ week prostaglandins preparations is used

NB:
- After the operation, the mother may experience a felling of guilt or regret, which may be shown by severe depression, mania and psychosis, and sleep disturbance.
- It may also lead to marital disharmony
- The mother should be prepared well before the operation. Let her understand why the operation is being done and the risk that the continuation of the pregnancy would put on her
b) Criminal abortion

This is a deliberate interruption of pregnancy prior the age of viability.
- It is common in unmarried girls or even women who already have larger families and there is family disharmony.
- Mother does not always seek professional help unless there is bleeding
- The operation is often hurried and lacks asepsis

\section*{Complications}
- Haemorrhage
- Sepsis, pelvic abscess, severe septicemia
- Endotoxin shock
- Haemolysis
- Renal damage

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
- Injuries to the birth canal and pelvic organs- rupture or perforation of the uterus
- Sudden death due to extreme syncope as result of dilatation of the cervix and some cases from amniotic fluid embolism
7) Septic abortion

It is mostly associated with criminal abortion, though it may also occur in spontaneous abortion if there has been sufficient bacterial contamination. Infection is caused by vaginal and intestinal bacterias that ascends into the uterine cavity and causes onset of infection.

Endometritis develops which extends outside the uterus to produce perimetritis, peritonitis and septicemia.

It is from this septicemia that the toxins will produce wide spread damage leading to septic shock and to total vascular collapse and eventually death.

\section*{Common causative organism}
-E-Coli
-Gram +ve streptococci
-Staphylococci

\section*{Clinical features}
- Patient will complain of feeling unwell
- May have headache and nausea accompanied by sweating and shivering
- Fever with temperature above $38^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$
- Increased pulse rate due to fever and infection
- Tenderness of the abdomen on the lower part of the uterus which is also bulky and soft
- Offensive PV discharge may be pinkish in colour.

\section*{Post Abortal Care}

Consists of the comprehensive care provided to clients with problems of incomplete abortion

\section*{Components of post abortal care}
1. Emergency treatment of complications arising from spontaneous or induced abortion
2. Family planning and counseling services
3. Access to comprehensive reproductive health

NB
Always ensure the control and prevention of cross infection when performing procedures

\section*{Care after Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA)}
* Check patients vital signs, sever vaginal bleeding and general condition
* Allow client to rest comfortably
* Give after care guidance which includes;

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
1) Explain to client before discharge that she will be at risk of repeated pregnancy for up to 2 weeks following treatment.
2) Counsel her on safe contraceptive methods that can be used immediately to avoid pregnancy
3) Explain where and how to get FP methods
4) Counsel on all FP methods available for her to make informed choice
5) Explain how to use the selected method
6) Tell her that FP methods other than condoms do not protect against STDs and HIV/AIDS
7) Alert her about the symptoms that would require the client to come back to hospital immediately
8) Tell her on signs of recovery when normal menstruation may resume
9) Advice on personal hygiene and when to resume sex
10) Provide the method of choice to the client.

\section*{Infertility and Climacteric Crises}

The government of Kenya, in its policies and guidelines on reproductive health, includes infertility in reproductive problems as components of reproductive health in essential obstetric care.

\section*{Infertility}

Infertility -is apparent inability to achieve conception after one year of normal intercourse at least twice a week.

Sterility-refers to absolute inability to achieve a conception

\section*{Types of infertility}

Primary and Secondary infertility

Primary infertility refers to no conception has taken place at all while in Secondary infertility there has been some conception even if it ended up in a spontaneous abortion.

\section*{Causes}

Are grouped into General factors, Female factors and Male factors

\section*{General factors}

\section*{1. Age}

Before puberty and after menopause, fertility in women is lowest but is at its height in the late teens and early twenties. It declines slowly after the age of 30 years.

In males, spermatogenesis commences actively at puberty and continues throughout life but aging reduces fertility to a variable extend.
2. Health and nutrition

Good health is associated with fertility but bad health is not an absolute barrier to conception.

Deliberate dieting (anorexia nervosa) will lead to loss of weight which in turn will lead to amenorrhea hence failure to ovulate.

Also obesity and infertility sometimes seem to be related in women probably because fat women ovulate and menstruate less frequently.
3. Chronic alcoholism or drug addiction

May also lead to infertility e.g. morphine tends to depress ovarian activity.

\section*{4. Psychological factors}

Anxiety and tension seem to be responsible for infertility in some individuals

\section*{Female factors}

\section*{1. Congenital}

Condition known as mullerian agenesis (no uterus \& ovaries), vaginal atresia-no vagina or narrowing, Stenosis of the vagina
2. Infections leading to tubal blockage e.g. gonorrhea, Chlamydia, tuberculosis, Salmonella, Enterobia vermicularis, post abortal and puerperal sepsis
3. Endocrine malfunction due to;
(a) Pituitary adenoma with increased prolactin leading to amenorrhea and an ovulation
(b) Hormonal imbalance with increased oestrogen leading to endometrial hyperplasia hence irregular periods or prolonged periods and cycles

Hypothyroidism is generally associated with infertility
4. Badly controlled Diabetes Mellitus or those with severe complications may impair fertility.
5. Uterine fibromyomata especially if large enough to distort the uterine cavity or block the tube. It may also cause recurrent abortions.
6. Cervical hostility-where the cervical mucus is unreceptive to spermatozoa.
7. Cervical incompetence-common cause of mid trimester abortion and will lead to Secondary infertility.
8. Endometriosis because of Menorrhagia may lead to infertility.

\section*{Male factors}
1. Congenital e.g. hypospadias.
2. Undescended testes.
3. Infections that may block the vas deferens especially gonorrhea and viral infections like mumps which can cause Orchitis interfering with spermatogenesis.
4. Auto immune problems whereby the sperms are killed by antibodies produced by hostile cervix.
5. Impotence where there is no erection for unknown reasons.
6. Ignorance of coitus and some cases of excessive coitus.
7. Less sperm count (Oligospermia) or no sperms at all (Azogospermia).
8. Endocrine disorders e.g. pituitary failure, adrenal hyperplasia or thyroid deficiency.

\section*{Management}
- Couples should be investigated based on their general reproductive history.

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
- Clinical examination of each partner should be carried out separately.
- Any worries should be noted and information obtained from each partner should be kept confidential.

\section*{Investigations}

\section*{In males}
i) Clinical examination to include assessment of the size and consistency of the testes and epidydimis on both sides
ii) Assess for presence or absence of varicocele or hernia and the size of the prostrate gland
iii) semen-analysis: to obtain specimen, the man should abstain from sex for 3-5 days and masturbation specimen is collected

NB: Specimen to be received in the lab within $1 / 2$ an hour

\section*{Examination}
- Look at the colour-should be cream white and viscous, if turbid indicates infection
- Bacteriology-to rule out pus cells
- Motility-progressive, sluggish or no movement
- Morphology-ideal is 50\%
- Sperm count-normal 40-370 million per ml. in Kenya 20 million sperm count is acceptable as normal
- Volume- $3-7 \mathrm{ml}$

\section*{NB}
$\checkmark$-if the sperm contains sperm antibodies, the spermatozoa become immobilized when they come to contact with the cervical mucus.
$\checkmark$-the test should be done 3 times
Once seminal fluid has been found to be normal, the woman is tested for ovulation and tubal patency.

\section*{In females}
i) Attention should be paid to any endocrine abnormality
ii) Routine pelvic examination should be done
iii) Take note of the following during history taking;
* Any illness that may have caused peritonitis e.g. tuberculosis
* Menstrual history-scanty or irregular
* Outcomes of previous pregnancies
* Marital history to include duration of marriage, how long she has been trying to get pregnant.
iv) Hysterosalphingography (HSG)-to check the patency of the tube. Radio- opaque dye is used

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
v) Lapporoscopy+dye test-methylene blue is introduced to assess the possibility of tuboplasty. It allows assessment of tubal patency but also gives proof that the tube is normal in appearance, the fimbrae are healthy and that the tubal movement is adequate

\section*{Methods to confirm ovulation}
1. Temperature method
2. Cervical mucus method
3. Progesterone level in the blood sample taken 1 week before periods is expected (day 12 of 28day cycle). A level of, more than $20 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$, confirms that ovulation has taken place.
vi) Ultra-sound to detect follicular growth and ovulation.
vii) Histological examination of the endometrium just before menses to asses the response to progesterone and rule out tuberculosis.

\section*{Specific treatment}

Not all couples that complain of infertility need to be investigated and treated.

Short periods of infertility in young couples need only clinical assessment and reassurance. Emphasize that they are normal and pregnancy is always possible even after many years.

\section*{In women}
-For hormonal imbalance give Clomiphene citrate 50 mg tds- action ant-oestrogen.
-For pituitary adenoma-leads to increased prolactimia associated with amenorrhea and un ovulation, Rx Bromocrptine 2.5 mg B.d for 1 month.
-Tubal blockage can be treated by Salphingolysis (tubal operation-consists of dividing peritubal adhesions around the ampullary end of the tube.
-Salphingotomy- making an opening into the distal end of a hydrosalphinx, usually better for fimbrial blockage
-In tubal anastomosis blockage, the isthmic portion is excised and the cut anatomized.
-In invitro -fertilization ovum is removed from a mature graafian follicle, fertilized with the partners sperm and the developing embryo replaced into the woman's uterus.

\section*{In males}
-Correction of undescended testes at an early age
-Azogospermia due to lack of gonadotrophic stimulation, Rx- human menopausal Gonadotrophin (HMG)
-No treatment for Azogospermia due to congenital anomalies or chromosomal abnormalities
-Mesterolone (Proviron) 50 mg daily for 3 months
-Synthetic androgens to improve spermatogenesis
-Oligospermia will improve with improvement in patient's general health and fitness; therefore encourage exercises and good diet
-Discourage excessive consumption of alcohol, tobacco and caffeine
-Excision of varicocele if present for Oligospermia
-Artificial insemination with the partner's semen for infertility due to importance or in hypospadias
-Advice couple to avoid excessive coitus, to obtain enough sleep, weight loss for obese patients, excessive and prolonged exposure of the scrotum to heat by avoiding hot baths, tight under wear or prolonged sitting in hot environments

Problems of infertility
i. Poor social standing
ii. Psychological distress
iii. Dysmenorrhea-poor economic output
iv. Morbidity
v. Dyspareunia, sexual disinterest
vi. Domestic disharmony
vii. Separation
viii. Divorce
ix. Promiscuity-HIV/AIDS, STIs
x. Associated uterine fibroids

\section*{Climacteric crises}
-This period in women is called menopause while in the males it is called andropause
-Menopause is declared after one year of no menstruation
-A number of women will undergo physical or emotional upsets but some will not be affected so much
-To some, menopause is a threatening period; it is a time when former diseases or ailments occur
-A few will see this process as witchcraft or untreatable disease
-Sexual desires is present in most women for many years

\section*{Symptoms}

They occur as a syndrome.
Menstrual syndrome refers to several symptoms related to hormonal imbalances in women
- Cessation of menstruation
- Hot flushes- flushing of the face and neck with occasional sweating
- The flash may be there only for a few seconds or may last up to 15 minutes and recur many times a day. It occurs as a result of rise in the peritoneal blood flow raising the pulse rate but BP remains.

Other symptoms
- Weight gain
- Osteoporosis -due to oestrogen deficiency
- Atrophic changes in the vulva- dyspareunia and discomfort
- Decreases in acidity predisposes the women to Vaginitis or Endometritis which may be confused for STDs
- Anxiety, irritability, insomnia and depression present in varying degrees. Seen in women with history of psychological instability
- Headache, aches, pains, urinary urgency and incontinence are physical expression of anxiety and depression
- Menses may cease abruptly or gradually diminish at the menopause

\section*{NB}
1. The possibility of malignancy must be considered in all cases of excessive and irregular bleeding.
2. Decrease in circulating oestrogen level leading to increased calcium excretion in the urine. Calcium is essential in bone development
3. Flushes are particularly severe and abrupt when there is a change in the hormones balance e.g. after bilateral Oophrectomy and in men after Orchidectomy.

\section*{Management}
- Majority of women adjusted soon. If they get support and understanding from their husbands and family
- Oestrogen may be given to suppress hot flushes which in turn will help relieve sleeplessness and depression. Such as combined oestrogen (Premarin) 0.62 mg daily or oestrogen Ualerate (Progynoval) 1 mg
- For atrophic changes in the genital tract Dienoestral cream to be applied locally for several weeks to relieve symptoms, then gradually reduce the dose
- Long term treatment may benefit patients but can induce endometrial cancer or enhance growth of existing carcinoma. Exclude tumors before starting this treatment. Progesterone if added may prevent this.
- For prevention of osteoporosis, increase calcium intake. Therefore teach client on importance of balanced diet especially plant foods, fruits and vegetables which promote hormone production especially soya beans, that have natural estrogens
- Psychological counseling

\section*{Ectopic pregnancy/extra-uterine pregnancy}

It is a condition in which a fertilized ovum (zygote) becomes implanted elsewhere other than in the endometrium of the uterine body-outside the uterine cavity

\section*{Sites for ectopic pregnancy}
1. Fallopian tube commonest site

\section*{Less common sites}
2. The ovary -0.5\%
3. The cervix -rare
4. Abdominal carvity-1\%

Tubal pregnancy accounts for 90\% of ectopic pregnancies. This type of pregnancy is common in the tropics because of high incidences of blocked tubes due gonorrhea, puerperal and post abortal sepsis and pelvic inflammatory disease

The ovum is usually fertilized in the fallopian tubes at a place called the ampulla, but unable to reach the uterine cavity because of loss of mobility and ciliary action, resulting into the ovum being arrested at;
- Fimbriated end of the tube-a rare site
- Ampulla- common site
- Isthmus- most dangerous site because of the frequency of tubal rupture at about 4-5 weeks
- The interstitial part of the tube- rupture starts at $2^{\text {nd }}$ trimester- rare site

\section*{Causes}
* Previous inflammatory process in the tube or acute PID which heals with scars and blocking the tube
* Peritoneal adhesions secondary to previous surgery due to e.g. appendisectomy, causes occlusion
* Endometriosis where endometrial tissue is lodged in the tube and occludes the tubal lumen
* Congenital abnormality of the uterus with division in the uterine tube
* Previous ectopic pregnancy where Salphingotomy or tubal anastomosis was done

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Once implantation has occurred in the tube, the sequence of events associated with pregnancy follows. The corpus luteum continues to produce progesterone which increases the thickness of the endometrium and ensures that it is not shed, so that the patient misses periods

The tube is not able to nourish the ovum for long and bleeding detaches the ovum. The ovum may be ejected in to the peritoneal cavity through the fimbriated end. The onset of pain may be gradual or acute

\section*{Signs and symptoms}

Ectopic pregnancy presents with very few symptoms until the foetus becomes large enough to rupture the fallopian tube. This makes it very difficult to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy before it ruptures

\section*{Before rupture}
- Amenorrhea for 2-3 months (common in about 80\% of cases)
- Vague lower abdominal pains, which the patient may ignore-this is due to slight leakage of blood from the tube that causes localized peritoneal irritation or by the distention of the tube by the growing fetus
- On palpation you might feel a slightly enlarged uterus or a mass on one side of the uterus NB
The patient may present with ruptured ectopic pregnancy even before the expected date of the next period

\section*{After rupture}
a) Acute fulminating rupture
- Patient presents with sudden onset of lower abdominal pain
- Vomiting and fainting because of the sudden intra peritoneal bleeding
- Vaginal bleeding, which may not develop until after many hours of rupture
- Patient is in great pain and is restless
- Sweating but the skin feels cold and clammy and palms are cold
- Patient yawns frequently as if hungry for air
- Radial pulse is weak, rapid and thread, BP low or un recordable
- Temperature usually normal
- Abdomen tender on touch with muscle guarding
- Pelvic examination very painful and difficult to palpate
- Extreme presents on moving the cervix with the examining fingers (cervical excitation)
- Uterus often slightly enlarged and tender mass might be felt on one side of the uterus
- Tender mass may also be palpated on the pouch of Douglass if blood is clotted there(pelvic haematocele)
- Patient is usually anemic
- Shoulder tip pain due to heamato- peritoneal diaphragmatic irritation

\section*{b) Chronic leaking ectopic pregnancy}
- Lower abdominal pain and un easiness. This pain is more marked on one side. It is continuous and not relieved by pressure as in the case of intestinal colic. Sometimes the act of emptying the bladder initiates a bout of pain.
- In a few cases patient complains of frequent urge to open bowel
- Amenorrhea with irregular vaginal bleeding which is usually slight and often dark brown in color. Which can be mistaken for threatened abortion
- Occasionally there is expulsion of a decidual cast especially if the pregnancy is beyond 2 months. This will the patient to give an impression of having had a miscarriage, and may make a health worker to carry out and evacuation thinking the patient has experienced an incomplete abortion
- Sometimes there is a feeling of nausea, vomiting and fainting attacks

NB
Sudden faintness is a characteristics symptom of ectopic gestation for a woman who c/o amenorrhea for 2-3 months and looks clinically healthy
- Anaemia of variable degrees
- Rapid pulse, low grade fever may be present
- Normal or low BP
- General tenderness and guarding in the lower abdomen, which is more marked on one side
- There may be a tender firm mass in one of the iliac fossae
- On VE you will note or feel a tender mass in one of the fornices
- Cervical excitation is present.

\section*{Differential Diagnosis of Acute Ruptured Ectopic Pregnancy}

It may be confused with conditions such as
- Acute PID
* Ruptured gastric or duodenal ulcer
* Fulminating appendicitis
- Torsion of the pedicle of an ovarian cyst
- Acute pyelonephrites
\$ Rupture of corpus luteum with intra peritoneal haemorrhage

NOTE
Always refer patients to hospital on slight suspicion of ectopic pregnancy
Sudden severe collapse with little or no warning signs generally occurs when the zygote is implanted in the isthmus with no history of misses abortion.
Investigations
* Paracenthesis of free clotting blood
$\star$ Culdocenthesis positive with dark blood
* Hb estimation and GXM
* Ultrasound

\section*{Management}
- Admit all cases of suspected ectopic pregnancy because it will require an emergency operation
- Prepare for laparatomy
- Start IV line/drip with normal saline and plasma expanders after obtaining specimen for GXM to treat shock
- Administer analgesics like morphine 15 mg or pethidine 100 mg for the pain
- Transfuse if necessary

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
- If in health center refer to a big hospital after resuscitation with IV fluids and where possible with potential blood donors to accompany the patient
- Operation- Salphingotomy or salphingectomy
- Diagnostic tests that may be done in hospital includes:
a) Ultra sonography
b) Culdocenthesis-non clotting blood will be aspirated from the culdo-sac
c) Human chorionic Gonadotrophin in urine
- A patient with fresh rupture- can have auto-transfusion done

Auto-transfusion involves scoping blood from the opened abdomen with a small galipot and pouring it through a filter made of 3-4 layers of gauze into a sterile bowel or jug containing sodium acid citrate solution, which is an anticoagulant. When 500 mls of blood is decanted into a sterile bottle, it is then set up on a drip that is already running. Sometimes the blood is aspirated directly from the peritoneal carvity into a plastic transfusion bag containing sodium citrate.
- Auto transfusion is not advisable if;
-History suggests heavy bleeding more than 24 hours before the operation
-Blood appears discolored or haemolysed -there is an offensive odor when the abdomen is opened

\section*{Advantages of auto-transfusion}
1. No risk of HIV transmission
2. Blood is easily available and perfectly compatible
- Post operative management same as for any other patient who was done laparatomy NB- However serious the condition may be patients usually recover well after operation.

\section*{Complications/ outcomes}
* Another tubal pregnancy in 10\% of cases
- Infertility in approximately $1 / 2$ the patients
* Normal pregnancy in about $1 / 2$ of the patients who have one ectopic pregnancy

\section*{Neoplastic Disorders (Neoplasm/Tumors)}

Consist of tumors of the breast, cervix, vulva, endometrium, uterine fibroids, ovarian cysts, and ca. of the ovaries, Hydatid form mole, Dermoid (resembles skin) cysts, Chorion carcinoma among others.

\section*{Classification of tumors}

\section*{A. Benign}

Are mostly confined to a particular tissue; They include warts or multiple papilomata (simple tumor arising from the glandular epithelial surface), fibroma and lipoma (benign tumor containing adipose tissue) and endometriosis

\section*{B. Malignant tumor}

Tend to spread to other organs (near and far) e.g. ca. that affects epithelial cells and sarcoma affecting the connective tissue

\section*{Causes of neoplasm}

The real causes are not well known but are associated with the following factors/causes
1) Drugs e.g. thalidomide, and tranquilizers when used so much-causes deformities in newborns and also tumors
2) Radiation may lead to leukemia
3) Toxins e.g. aflatoxins found in cereals and groundnuts may lead to carcinoma of the liver
4) Alcohol may lead to cirrhosis of the liver
5) Smoking associated with cancer of the lungs
6) High parity- associated with ca. of the cervix
7) Sexual activity especially at an early age can lead to ca. of the cervix, and exposure to STI

\section*{Diagnosis}

Based on:
- Clinical symptoms and signs
- Examination
- Biopsy

\section*{General management}
- Detailed history
- Investigations to include routine lab tests such as Hb , Urea, Blood group, Urinalysis etc
- Examination under anesthesia (EUA)- for biopsy to detect cancer for staging
- Treatment may take several forms;
i) Surgery- palliative in late stages to reduce the tumor
> -radical surgery in early stages (whole organ or system is removed-sometimes curative)
ii) Chemotherapy- administration of ant cancer drugs
iii) Radiotherapy- in advanced stages

\section*{Note}

Sometimes a combination of all the above methods mentioned can be employed.

\section*{Prevention}

Measures taken are those that enable the tumors to be detected at an early stage when control and treatment is possible. They include;
1) Pelvic examination once a year
2) Self breast examination
3) Pap smear to all women in reproductive age once a year
4) Sonography(scan of pelvic area to identify ovarian tumors and uterine fibroids)
5) Endometrial biopsy in menopausal bleeding through D\&C to detect ca. of the endometrium
6) Encourage faithfulness in married couple and abstinence in the un married
7) Discourage early marriages

\section*{Tumors of the vulva}

\section*{Introduction}

Accounts for 5\% of reproductive cancer. The benign lesions include; Bartholins cysts/abscess and granuloma. Cancers are rare. Commonest ca. is basal cell carcinoma (rodent ulcer), it grows slowly but does not metastasis. It infiltrates (ozz or leak) locally.

Note-granuloma is a tumor formed from granulation tissue; granulation is out growth of new capillaries and connective tissue cells from the surface of an open wound.

\section*{Diagnostic signs and symptoms of neoplastic conditions of the vulvae}

\section*{Early signs}
- Ulcers
- Swelling
- Soreness/irritation /excoriation
- Slight bleeding may occur

\section*{Late signs}
- Purulent offensive discharge
- Enlarged inguinal glands which may break down and ulcerate leading to severe haemorrhage from erosion of femoral vessels

\section*{Diagnosis}

Biopsy for histology

\section*{Treatment}
* EUA \& Biopsy taken for staging
* Surgery-radical excision of the vulvae, inguinal and femoral glands in the late stage
* Radiotherapy for tumors at the fourchette because of involvement of anal canal. Radiotherapy may be curative in early stages.

\section*{Prevention}

Biopsy taking on suspected cases i.e. women with leukoplakia (white thickened patches on mucus membrane) and itching

\section*{Prognosis}

Depends on the stage
- Worse when the glands are involved
- Those less than 2 cm in diameter prognosis is 2times better than larger tumors
- Small tumors with no palpable gland, if removed with the gland, the patient has $75 \%$ chance of surviving for up to 5 years

\section*{Tumors of the urethra}

\section*{Introduction}

Tumors of the urethra are rare but if it occurs, it is usually a squamous (non glandular epithelium covering the whole body) cell carcinoma.

Carbuncle- small bright, red swelling at the urethral orifice occurs in menopausal women. Some cause no symptoms but most are very tender and cause painful coitus or micturation. Carbuncles are not neoplastic but results from chronic infection of the Para -urethral glands.

\section*{Treatment}

Excision or burning by diathermy

\section*{Tumors of the vagina}

\section*{Introduction}

Tumors of the vagina are also rare but if it occurs, it is usually a squamous type. Benign tumors are common and include condylomata accuminata (venereal warts), fibromyomata and endometriosis.

\section*{Venereal warts}
-Caused by human pappiloma virus
-warts proliferate profusely during pregnancy. It can grow in to a large mass that may even occlude the introitus late in pregnancy
-secondary infection is common
-they regress during peuperium and may even disappear
-the virus does not affect the fetus

\section*{Management}
- Fluoracil- used in non pregnant state
- Cryotherapy(use of cold) -in pregnancy
- Excision of the lesions
- Improved vaginal hygiene

\section*{Cancer of vagina}

\section*{Signs and symptoms}
-post coital bleeding and later offensive watery discharge
-recto vaginal fistulae from ulcerated growth

\section*{Treatment}
- Often very unsatisfactory
- Most cases are treated by local application of radium or cesium and external irradiation of the lymph gland of the pelvis or
- Extensive operation to remove the whole uterus, vagina and pelvic lymph glands.
- If the rectum is involved it is also removed and colostomy established.

Note- cancers of the vagina are commonly spread from the cervix or uterus.

\section*{Tumors of the cervix}

\section*{Introduction}

Benign tumors of the cervix include polyps, fibroids and Nabothian follicles (it comes as a result of infection). Nabothian follicles is a cystic distention of chronically inflamed cervical glands blocking flow of mucus

Carcinomas of the cervix includes adenocarcinoma which s very common, and squamous carcinoma which is less common

\section*{Cancer of the cervix}

Ca. of the cervix is a common genital malignancy. It begins in the cervix at the margin of the external os where it stays for sometimes before it begins to penetrate the neighboring tissues. It extends outwards the pelvic wall, downwards into the vagina, backwards to the rectum and forward to the bladder.

It can arise at any age but common between ages 40 \& 50 years. But it is also occurring more frequently in younger patients.

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}

It common too to people who start coitus early in life and have multiple sexual partners, spouse with multiple sexual partners, high parity, human pappiloma virus and herpes simplex type II.

Risk factors
1) Early age of $1^{\text {st }}$ coitus( below 18 years)
2) Multiple sexual partners
3) Viral infections like herpes simplex type II
4) High parity above 5 deliveries
5) Poor hygiene where dirt collects in the vagina or in the foreskin of uncircumcised men

\section*{Staging of ca. of the cervix}

\section*{Stage 0/pre-invasive carcinoma/ carcinoma insitu}

It is asymptomatic and can only be detected by cervical smears and biopsies.

\section*{Stage I/invasive carcinoma}

Ca. confined to the cervix

\section*{Stage II a}

Ca. spread to vaginal vault

\section*{Stage II b}

Ca. spread to the parametrium (connective tissue around the uterus) but cervix not fixed

\section*{Stage III}

Ca. spread to lower 2/3 of the vagina or parametrial spread and cervix fixed

\section*{Stage IV}

Involvement of bladder and rectum or metastasis outside the pelvis

\section*{Signs and symptoms}
- Post coital bleeding due to friction on the ulcerated cervix
- Post menopausal bleeding, sometimes irregular vaginal bleeding
- Watery discharge which may be blood stained and offensive or purulent indicating infection of the necrotic surface of the tumor
- Pain in the lower abdomen or back(very late symptom
- Incontinence of urine and faeces due to fistulae formation

\section*{Investigations}
* Cervical cytology/pap smear-study of structure and function of cells
* Cone biopsy
* Hb level estimation
\$ Speculum exam- will shows easily bleeding lesions on the cervix

\section*{Management}
- Detailed history
- Physical examination, EUA to conduct biopsy and do staging
- In pre-invasive stage, excision can be done then followed by repeated smears.

Treatment of choice hysterectomy (radical hysterectomy) or staining the lesions with iodine preparation (irradiation)
- In invasive stage- radiotherapy and surgery in cases that can not be operated on
- If surgery is suggested then Wertheim's hysterectomy(total hysterectomy with Salphingo Oophrectomy) the upper part of the vagina and also pelvic lymph glands are removed

\section*{Prognosis}

Five years survival rates
- Stage I-75\%
- Stage II- 50\%
- Stage III \& IV- 10\%

\section*{Tumors of the uterus}

Commonest benign tumor is fibroid. Other names- fibromyoma, fibromyomata, or fibroleiomyomata

\section*{Fibroids}
- Are benign tumors of smooth muscles, resembling the smooth muscles of the myometrium found in the fundus and body of the uterus as well as in the cervix.
- They can grow to any size
- It most commonly found in women about 30years and above, both primigravidas and maltigravidas.it may have pregnancy complicated by it.
- It is associated with null parity, low parity, sub- fertility and infertility
- It is associated with oestrogen action in a way not well understood.

\section*{Varieties of uterine fibroids}

Named according to their location in the uterus
1) Interstitial- starts as a small nodule in the myometrium, when they increase in size, they extrude towards the peritoneal surface or into the uterine carvity leading to increased menstrual loss due to enlargement of uterine body.
2) Sub serous (Sub peritoneal) - Fibroids lie outside the uterus and are covered with peritoneum. They are usually multiple, ranging from small nodules on the surface of the uterus to enormous masses weighing up to 20 Kg or more. They tend to grow up into the abdomen and may become pendunuclated so that on bimanual examination, the tumor seems to be separated from the uterus and feel like an ovarian tumor.

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
3) Sub mucus (sub endometrial) fibroids- are near the endometrium or hang in to the carvity and form a polyp with long pedicle. The stalk of the polyp contains a few blood vessels which nourish it. The uterine carvity may contract and cervix dilates and expels the polyp through it.
4) Cervical fibroids-are rare, only $2 \%$ of uterine fibroids arise in the cervix. It is usually a single tumor, although there may be other tumors in the body of the uterus.
This type of tumor will cause distortion and elongation of the cervical canal and displace the body of the uterus upwards. A large cervical fibroid may cause urine retention.

\section*{Signs and symptoms}
- Non tender mass in the lower abdomen with dyspareunia or heavy periods with clots.
- Pain not common but if present it indicates associated endometriosis or PID or some complications like torsion.
- Sometimes colicky pain may be experienced when the polyp is being extruded through the cervix by uterine contractions.
- Pressure symptoms due to the weight i.e. frequency of micturation, retention of urine.
- Enlargement of the abdomen
- On palpation the uterus feels harder than when it feels with a pregnancy
- No tenderness o palpation unless the tumor is undergoing red degeneration
- Uterine soufflé(soft blowing sound within the arteries of gravid uterus) similar to that of pregnancy may be heard
- On V.E a mass is felt that is firm, nodular, non tender and moves with the cervix. Sometimes the cervix may be found to be moved or pushed downwards or displaced to one side.

\section*{Investigations}
* IVP(intravenous pyelography)
* Explorative laparatomy
* Biopsy
* Hb, VDRL, Urinalysis, Blood group
$\star$ Hysterosalphingography in sub fertile and infertile cases

\section*{Management}
- For small benign tumors that are not causing symptoms, no treatment needed, but the patient needs re-examination at 6-12 months interval.
- If the tumor is increasing in size, it should be treated
- Counsel patient and family on effects of the tumor on the menstruation, menopause and libido
- Usually such tumors ceases to grow at menopause(grow slowly ) seldom become malignant
- Surgical treatment in -heavy or prolonged bleeding caused by large tumors
- Large tumors in young women because of possibility of growing further -where malignant change is suspected e.g. increase in size after menopause -where it causes urine retention, obstructs labour or has undergone torsion
- Myomectomy- in cases where the mother desires more pregnancy
- Hysterectomy in patients over 40 years of age and above
- Pre and post operative care same as for any patient undergoing major surgery.

\section*{Prognosis}
- Surgical therapy is curative
- Pregnancy is possible after multiple Myomectomy
- Premature menopause will not occur where ovaries were left intact

\section*{Complications of uterine fibroids in pregnancy}
1) Degenerative changes
a. Hyaline degeneration-the muscle and the fibrous tissue are replaced by hyaline material
b. Cystic degeneration- a fibroid is converted is converted into a cavity containing clear fluid
c. Red degeneration(necrobiosis)- when there is haemorrhage in to the substance of the fibroid due to ischemia

\section*{Signs and symptoms}
-patient is pregnant
-excruciating pain and tenderness over the fibroid mass
-hyperpyrexia and generally feeling ill
d. Calcification- when calcium deposits are deposited in the substance of the fibroid the fibroid becomes hard.
e. Malignant or Sarcomatous degeneration-not common in pregnancy
2) Abortion- the blastocyst may be implanted on the fibroid leading to blighted ovum(diseased )
3) Premature labour- if they are large and interfere with uterine blood flow
4) Obstructed labour
5) Pressure symptoms e.g. urine retention
6) PPH-fibroids increase bleeding surfaces
7) Can cause sub-involution in peuperium resulting to prolonged lochia.

\section*{Management of fibroid associated with pregnancy}
- Refer all expectant mothers suspected to be having fibroids to a gynecologist
- Myomectomy can not be done during pregnancy
- When red degeneration causes unbearable pain, admit the patient, confine to bed and give liberal dose of analgesics
- If it causes obstructed labour -C/S
- If it causes urine retention - catheterization

\section*{Carcinoma of the body of the uterus}

\section*{Introduction}

Usually occurs in women post menopause, the cause is not known. It affects those who have had children and those who have not alike. It an important cause of post menopausal bleeding

\section*{Symptoms}
* Intermenstrual bleeding
* Post menopausal bleeding
* Uterine enlargement may be present.

\section*{Diagnosis}

Curettage of the uterus

\section*{Treatment}
- Total hysterectomy and bilateral Salphingo Oophrectomy plus removal of $2 / 3$ of the vagina
- Some surgeons prefer pre-operative radiotherapy to reduce the risks of recurrences at the vaginal vault
- Progestogens pre and post operatively for up to 2 years
- Radiotherapy and progestogens in cases that can not be operated.

\section*{Ovarian tumors}

\section*{Introduction}

Ovary is the only organ in the body that is capable of producing many varieties of tumors. Majority of them are cystic and benign. While a few are highly malignant, some produce estrogens with symptoms of Menorrhagia.

\section*{Cysts of ovarian follicles and corpus luteum}
1) Follicular cysts- Are multiple and usually fond in metropathia haemorrhagica though they may not enlarge the ovary enough to make it clinically palpable. Sometimes follicular cysts may reach the size of a tennis ball and cause discomfort and may be palpable on VE.
2) Lutein and theca-Lutein cyst-are lined by cells of the corpus luteum type and may arise from either granulosa or theca. They appear yellowish like the corpus luteum. The commonest type is the corpus luteum cyst.
3) Blood cyst-where there is bleeding it to the follicular cyst, a corpus luteum or a neoplasm in the ovary. If the blood has been shed for some time, it will be thicker and darker than normal blood. In this case the name chocolate or terry cysts are used.

\section*{Benign ovarian neoplasm}

They include;
1) Mucinous cystadenoma (mucin -mixture of glycoprotein)-commonest of all, can become so big and distend the abdomen. Can occur at any age but rare before puberty.
2) Serous cystadenoma-common type of benign new growth. It has smooth lining which may be confused with a large follicular cyst at operation
3) Dermoid (resembles skin) cyst/benign teratoma-may contain almost any type of tissue derived from two or more of the primary germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm \& ectoderm). They are mixed together in an irregular pattern. It can occur at any age but most common in the reproductive period especially between 20-30 years.

\section*{Malignant tumors of the ovary}

It is the $3^{\text {rd }}$ most common tumors affecting the genital tract.
$1^{\text {st }}$-cancer of uterus
$2^{\text {nd }}$ - cancer of cervix
$3^{\text {rd }}$ - cancer of the ovaries
Ovarian cancers tend to spread quietly around the peritoneum of the pelvis and alimentary canal. The prognosis is usually poor due its silent nature

\section*{Symptoms}

Usually presents too late and they include;
- Abdominal swelling of long duration
- Abdominal pain

\section*{Investigations}
- IVP
- Explorative laparatomy
- Biopsy

\section*{Complications in order of frequency}
1) Tortion- which can cause lower abdominal pains, rapid tortion causes severe pain and patient may vomit
On examination abdomen is tender but not rigid as in peritonitis
2) Rupture of the cyst-emergency laparatomy
3) Haemorrhage- small haemorrhage causes no symptoms but is seen a laparatomy. Massive haemorrhage may cause pain like tortion

\section*{Management}
- Surgery which includes cystectomy of one or both ovaries or removal of ovaries, tubes and uterus or removal of as much malignant tissue as possible or biopsy in cases that can not be operated.
- Radiotherapy-ovarian tumors are often radio sensitive but often re-appear and should therefore not be used as primary treatment. It always good to do laparatomy for complete diagnosis and for biopsy
- Chemotherapy by use of cytotoxic drugs. This is used as the last resort because of the disadvantages e.g.
-makes patient very ill
-cause leucopenia and total alopecia
For cases that show no signs of improvement hospice care should be sought

\section*{Prognosis}
$\checkmark$ In a few fortunate women, prognosis may be good so long as metastasis has not taken place.
$\checkmark$ For cases where metastasis has occurred mortality is 100\%

Note- tortion and rupture of ovarian cyst is acute surgical emergency. The ovary and tube must be removed.

\section*{Cancer of the Breast}

Breast is the commonest site of carcinoma in women aged 40-44 years and leading cause of death.

\section*{Risk Factors Associated with Breast Cancer}
1).Hereditary, although the mechanism of inheritance is not clear.

Studies have shown that women whose mothers or sisters have had breast ca. are 2-3 times more likely to develop the disease.
2).Marital status and parity

Single and nulliparous women and those with children less than 3 have a higher incidence than married and maltiparous women.
3).mammary dysplasia or cystic disease of the breast accompanied by proliferative change, pappilomatosis or solid hyperplasia is associated with increased risk of ca. of the breast.
4).a woman with ca. in one breast is likely to develop on the other breast.
5).women with ca. of the uterus or ovary
6).hormonal imbalance
7).oral contraceptives and menopausal oestrogen

\section*{Clinical features}
- Lump present on the breast- biopsy should be done to confirm diagnosis(staging is determined to avoid inappropriate measures like radical mastectomy to patient with metastasis)
- Take thorough medical history to include;
-Menarche, pregnancies, L.M.P, previous breast lesions and family history of ca.
-Presenting complains- $80 \%$ will have painless lump and in $90 \%$ the lump will have been discovered by the patient her self.
- On breast examination- note the size, contour, minimal nipple retraction, slight edema, redness and retraction of skin
- Breast ca. consist of non-tender firm or hard lump with poorly delaminated margins
- Slight nipple or skin retraction is an important sign.
- Very small erosion (1-2 mm ) of the nipple epithelium may be the only manifestation of ca. of the breast.
- Watery serous or bloody discharge from the nipple is an occasional sign.

\section*{Diagnosis}
1).Blood test for;
$\star$ Sedimentation rate- if raised indicates Ca.
* Alkaline phosphate- if raised indicates liver metastasis
* Hypercalcaemia-indicates advanced malignancy
* Complete blood count
* Urinalysis
2).X-ray to determine frequency of metastasis to the lungs
3).CT-Scan- to detect bone metastasis, brain etc
4).cytological examination of nipple discharge or cyst or breast tissue
5).mammogram- soft tissue radiological examination of the breast.

\section*{Methods used to perform breast biopsy}

\section*{1. Needle biopsy}

Involves aspiration of the tumor cells or obtaining a small cone of tissue with a special needle (an office procedure)

\section*{2. Open biopsy}

Most widely used. It is performed under general anesthesia. Open biopsy is used to confirm positive needle biopsy

\section*{Specific Management of Breast Ca.}

Note-Treatment should not be undertaken without an equivocal histological diagnosis of ca. the safest course is to take biopsy for all suspicious masses found on physical examination
- Treatment may be curative or palliative according to clinical stage I, II and II Disease
- In stage IV with distant metastasis and for previously treated patients who have developed distant metastasis or in eradicable local recurrences- palliative treatment by radiotherapy, hormones, chemotherapy or a combination of methods is recommended.
- Surgery;
i. Radical mastectomy

This involves en block removal of the breast, pectoral muscles and axillary nodes (standard curative procedure for breast Ca.)

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}

NB-It is contraindicated in Ca. that has spread to sub-clavicular nodes or to more distant sites because it will not cure.

\section*{ii. Extended Radical Mastectomy}

It involves the removal of the internal mammary nodes in addition to standard radical mastectomy.
iii. Modified radical mastectomy

It involves an en- block removal of the breast and preservation of the pectoralis major muscles.

Advantages of this type of operation is that it is cosmetic and functional in that the preservation of the pectoralis major muscles avoids a hollow beneath the clavicles hence preventing shoulder dysfunction and edema of the arm.

\section*{iv. Simple mastectomy}

It is done when the malignancy is confined to the breast without spread to adjacent muscles or to the regional nodes or beyond.

\section*{v. Local excision/lumpectomy}

Also known as partial mastectomy and provides definite treatment for early breast Ca. especially for a small stage I lesion.
- Radiotherapy

Used to treat breast Ca. particularly those that are locally advanced or in cases where the mammary displasiapatient refuses a mastectomy.
Radiotherapy can be used in conjunction with radical mastectomy as a pre or post operative course of action in order to reduce the incidence of local recurrences from residual cancer in the operative field.
- Chemotherapy

Can be used in conjunction with radical mastectomy, especially in patients found to have positive axillary nodes

\section*{Note}
a) Morbidity and mortality rate following radical mastectomy are low and the procedure is generally well tolerated even by elderly patients.
b) A patient who has had radical mastectomy should be instructed to avoid breaks in the skin of the hand or arm on the operated side and to refrain from tasks likely to cause superficial wounds and infection.
c) Immunization or inoculation should not be given on this arm.

\section*{Complications of Breast Ca.}

\section*{1. Local recurrences which signal spread}

\section*{2. Edema of the arm-in early post operative period caused by lymphatic obstruction or infection.}

\section*{Management}
- Chronic edema is managed by elevation of the arm by use of special elastic sleeve.
- General pre and post operative care
- Need for long term care with periodic re-examination to detect recurrences (every 6 months) for up to 5 years post operatively then every 6-12 months for life.
- Teach the client the importance of self breast examination monthly after menses
- Mammogram annually
- Advice on active exercises of the shoulder and arm to facilitate rehabilitation after breast reconstruction- should start early post operatively.
- Counseling before and after surgery
- Advice where to obtain prosthesis to wear in her braziers.
- Caution patient that high levels of estrogens produced by the placenta during pregnancy can worsen estrogen sensitive Ca. that has metastasis.

\section*{Prognosis}
- For cancer confined to breast, 5 year clinical cure rate by radical mastectomy is $75-90 \%$
- When axial nodes are involved, the rate drops to 40-60\% at 5 years
- Ten years after radical mastectomy, the over all clinical cure rate is only $25 \%$

NB- breast cancer tends to be more malignant in young patients than in older patients.

\section*{Benign Growth of the Breast}

\section*{1). Mammary Dysplasia (Chronic Cystic Mastitis)}

It is common in women between 30-40 years, but is rare in post menopausal women. This suggests that it is related to ovarian activity. The estrogen hormone considered to be the cause/etiologic factor

\section*{Clinical features}
- Asymptomatic lump, discovered accidentally in the breast
- Nipple retraction may be present
- Discomfort occurs or increases during the pre-menstrual phase of the cycle-the cyst tend to increase in size.
- Fluctuation in size and rapid appearance or disappearance of a breast tumor is a combination feature.
- Many patients will give history of transient lump in the breast or cyclic breast pain.

NB
If skin retraction is present, the diagnosis of cancer should be assured until it is disapproved by biopsy.

\section*{Treatment}
- Before any treatment is commenced a biopsy should be done to check for any suspicion of lesions.
- Excision for small localized cysts after Ca. has been ruled out.
- Aspiration of fluid from the cyst. Which may be straw colored, gray, greenish, brown or black can be evacuated and mass disappears.
- Cytology exam of the fluid.
- Re-examination $f$ patient at intervals of 2-3 weeks for 3 months and then every 6-12 months there after for life.
- Breast pain with generalized mammary dysplasia is best treated by a voiding trauma and wearing brassier (at all times) to give good protection and support.

\section*{Prognosis}

Risk of breast cancer to this group of women is twice common than the general population.
Advice
$\checkmark$ To examine the breast each month just after menses.
$\checkmark$ To inform the doctor if the mass appears.
$\checkmark$ Attend clinic appointments regularly.

\section*{2) Fibro Adenoma}

It is a common benign neoplasm that occurs in young women within 20 years or after puberty. It occurs at earlier age in blacks than in whites.

Multiple tumors in one or both breasts are found in 10-15\% of patients.

\section*{Clinical features}
- It a round, firm, discrete, relatively movable, non tender mass of 1-5 cm in diameter
- Usually discovered accidentally
- Clinical diagnosis in young patients is usually not difficult( for older patients ca. of the breast must be considered)
- It does not usually occur after menopause, but post menopausal women may develop it after administration of estrogenic hormone. Treatment is excision and pathologic examination to rule out ca. lesions.

\section*{Hydatid Form Mole/Molar Pregnancy}

\section*{Introduction}

Hydatid form mole or molar pregnancy is a term applied to a gross malformation of the trophoblast in which the chorionic villi proliferate and become vascular resulting to cystic proliferation of the chorionic villi.

The villi are filled with fluid and become distended forming vesicles of various sizes, and the mass looks like a bunch of grapes or arrangements of pawpaw seeds.

The chorio -decidua space becomes obliterated and maternal blood can not circulate. The absence of maternal blood and intervillous circulation gives the whole structure a creamy white appearance.

Oxygen and nutrients can not reach the foetus which dies and becomes absorbed. The villi continue to multiply so that uterine enlargement occurs usually out of proportion to the duration of pregnancy.

The increased proliferation of the trophoblast gives rise to tremendous increase in the levels of Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (HCG) and large amounts are excreted in urine. This causes the pregnancy test to be strongly +ve.

In addition, this hormone stimulates the ovaries resulting in formation of Lutein cysts which may grow tremendously.

Hydatid form change is a form of trophoblast neoplasia which may lead to frankly malignant proliferation of the trophoblast cell known as chorio-carcinoma.

\section*{Types of Hydatid Form Mole}
a) Complete mole-shows total Hydatid form change with no evidence of foetal circulation. This type is more likely to develop malignant change
b) Partial mole-associated with the fetus (even if the only evidence is traces of a microscopic foetal circulation).they are less likely to develop malignant change.

\section*{Causes}

The actual cause is not known but is associated with the following;
1. Maternal age under 20 and above 45 years in whom congenital abnormalities are likely to be found.
2. High parity and malnutrition. No evidence but is associated with congenital malformation.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Presents as threatened abortion or incomplete abortion.
- In threatened stage i.e. before the cervix opens, the diagnosis of Hydatid form mole is suspected if;

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
-bleeding does not stop within a week of bed rest.
-uterine enlargement is greater than gestational age
-foetal parts not palpable
-foetal movements not felt at 18-20weeks
-features of hyperemesis gravidarum i.e. excessive nausea, vomiting, ptyalism etc are still present and sever after 3 months
- When the cervix opens, passage of typical grape like vesicles per vagina confirms the diagnosis.
- Bleeding may be very heavy when a mole aborts spontaneously
- Sign and symptoms of pre-eclampsia at 16 weeks are strongly suggestive of a mole.ie protein uria etc
- Pallor and dyspnoe due to anaemia which is often greater than expected
- High levels of HCG

\section*{Diagnosis and Investigations}
$\checkmark$ Ultra sound
$\checkmark$ Passage of vesicles per vagina
$\checkmark$ HCG(+ve pregnancy test)

\section*{Management}
- Before diagnosis is made mange as threatened abortion
- Once diagnosis has been made the uterus should be evacuated
- Evacuation carries some risks such as;

\section*{Main risks before and during evacuation}
i) Possibility of haemorrhage
ii) Risk of trophoblastic invasion and perforation of the myometrium and or
iii) Dissemination of possibly malignant cells

In order to ensure immediate safety of the patient, the following measures may be included in the management;
- Uterus should be completely emptied by suction after spontaneous abortion
- If spontaneous abortion does not occur an attempt to empty uterus by suction should be made possibly up to 14 weeks
- Oxytocin must be given if bleeding becomes severe
- If the period is passed 16 weeks abortion should be induced using prostaglandins and oxytocin
- Rapid evacuation of a large uterus has been known to cause DIC and fatal shock
- Give blood transfusion to treat anaemia
- Take serial pregnancy tests and chest X-ray
- Total hysterectomy to older patients who do not wish to have more children

\section*{Follow up care}
* Family planning to prevent pregnancy for at least one year
* Pregnancy test monthly for one year should be -ve if +ve and high, suspect chorio-carcinoma
* Chemotherapy when high HCG in serum after 6 months or detectable after 6 months
* Chest X-ray monthly until titres of HCG are -ve and then every two months for one year

Prognosis
$\checkmark$ Close follow up and early chemotherapy result to cure rate of almost 100\%
$\checkmark$ Complications such as chorio-carcinoma and early metastasis to the lungs is possible

\section*{Chorio carcinoma is suspected if}
1. Recurrent bleeding occurs
2. Pregnacy test remains +ve for 3 months after evacuation
3. Pregnancy test becomes then +ve again

\section*{Nursing care after evacuation}
- Check BP, pulse and respirations half hourly
- Check if PV bleeding is present, give Ergometrine 0.5 mg IM and report to the Doctor
- Daily vulval toilet
- Inspect the pads
- Maintain intake output chart
- Any mole expelled should be sent for examination

\section*{Complications}
1) Shock
2) Uterine perforation
3) Sepsis
4) Malignant changes/Chorio-carcinoma

\section*{Chorio-Carcinoma/Chorio -Epitheloma}

\section*{Introduction}

This is cancer of the placenta. It is a malignant disease of the trophoblast. It is sometimes referred to as malignant trophoblastic disease.

50\% of the cases may follow a Hydatid form mole abortion, 25\% a normal term pregnancy and 25\% an ectopic pregnancy.

Prognosis is very poor.
It is characterized by irregular vaginal bleeding which may sometimes be profuse.
In chorio-carcinoma the growth invades not only the lining of the uterus, but also the muscle wall and sometimes perforates the uterus and appears in the peritoneal carvity.

Secondary deposits may be found in the lungs, vagina and brain when post mortum is done.
Some cases of chorio carcinoma where there is generalized involvement of the lungs, patient may present with cough, chest pain and haemoptysis and sometimes mistakenly as PTB until they are found to show no responses to treatment with ant TB drugs.

\section*{Diagnosis}
1. HCG very highly +ve
2. Pelvic angiography shows dilatation of the blood vessels supplying the uterus
3. Chest X-ray shows canon balls (snow storm) in case of metastasis to the lungs

\section*{Treatment}
- Once diagnosed chemotherapy is immediately indicated i.e.
-Methotraxate $0.4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day-drug of choice
-Combined therapy especially if methotraxate appears ineffective- 6mecaptopurine 6-10 mg/kg/day.
- Frequent estimation of HCG
- Frequent blood transfusion
- Advice patient to delay conception for one year to give time to the damaged ova to be shed. (methotraxate can be retained in the body for up to 8 months and may have damaged the Oocysts resulting to possibility of increased foetal abnormalities

\section*{Side effects of the above drugs}
* Anaemia
* Leucopenia(low white cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia(low platelets count)
* Alopecia
* Buccal ulceration
* Glositis
* Angular stomitis
* Gastro-intestinal upsets

\section*{Other drugs that can be used}

Actinomycin D and Vincristine

\section*{Follow up care}

These patients should be followed up for life and HCG estimation carried out at frequent intervals.

\section*{Hysterectomy}

It is surgical removal of the womb either to treat cancer or to remove fibroids.

\section*{Indications}
1. Benign and malignant tumors of the uterus
2. Malignant tumors of the ovaries
3. Some cases of endometriosis
4. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding

\section*{Types of Hysterectomies}
1) Total abdominal hysterectomy
2) Sub total hysterectomy
3) Extended or Wertheim's hysterectomy
4) Pelvic exenteration (evisceration)
5) Vaginal hysterectomy-removal of the uterus through the vagina especially in ${ }^{\text {3rd }}$ degree uterine prolapsed.

\section*{Vaginal hysterectomy}

Is the removal of the uterus through the vagina especially in ${ }^{3 \text { rd }}$ degree uterine prolapsed.

\section*{Pelvic exenteration (evisceration)}

It is surgical removal of pelvic contents. It involves the removal of bladder, uterus, vagina, parametrium, rectum and anal canal.

\section*{Extended "Wertheim's hysterectomy"}

The operation of total hysterectomy is extended e.g. in carcinoma of the cervix or carcinoma of the uterus. It is a must to extend the operation to include a small area of parametrium, a length of uterosacral ligaments and about 1 inch of the vagina.

\section*{Sub Total Hysterectomy}

In this operation, the body of the uterus is amputated just below the isthmus. The bladder is not separated from the vaginal wall as in the total operation, nor is the dissection so deep in the pelvis.

\section*{Total Abdominal Hysterectomy}

The whole uterus is removed plus the cervix. It may or may not involve the removal of the ovaries.

\section*{Management}

\section*{Preoperative care}
- Patient is admitted 1-2 days before the operation
- Routine observations made on admission-BP, Temperature, Pulse and Respirations.
- Urinalysis
- HVS if there is infection
- General medical examination
- Check Hb, GXM
- Consent
- Patient preparation as for any major operation- shaving, enema, bathing in the evening or morning of operation, night sedation, starving patient 6 hours before operation
- Premedication and immediate pre-operative observations

\section*{Post operative care}
- Observation of vital signs, wound, vaginal loss and infusion site
- Analgesics as prescribed

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
- Recording of input and output
- Early ambulation to prevent DVT
- Check Hb on the $3^{\text {rd }}$ POD
- Vaginal pack following major vaginal surgery to prevent bleeding -removed in 24 hours
- Cather removed in 48 hours if there is no problem or as ordered by the doctor
- Alternate sutures to be removed on the $6^{\text {th }}$ day then all on the $7^{\text {th }}$ day
- Discharge on the $10^{\text {th }}-14$ day post operatively
- Nutritional care
- Personal comfort
- Psychotherapy
- Medication as ordered

Advice
1) No more menstruation
2) No child bearing
3) Sex will sometimes be painful or less pleasurable

\section*{Genital Disorders and Injuries}

This shall be discussed in the following groups;
1. Dystrophies and cysts
2. Relaxation of pelvic muscles
3. Trauma

\section*{Dystrophies and cysts of the vulva}

Dystrophy refers to the defective nutrition of an organ or tissue, usually muscle.

\section*{Types of dystrophies}
1) Atrophic Lesions

Atrophic lesions are due to aging, when there is a decrease in endogenous oestrogen. Atrophic changes in the vulva, skin and sub-dermal tissue are usually gradual. E.g.

\section*{Lichen sclerosis}

It is a systemic dermatological condition and the most common cause of atrophic dystrophy. It causes contractures of vaginal introitus and the skin become thin, fragile and easily traumatized.

\section*{Clinical features}
$>$ Dysuria
- Pruritis
- Dyspareunia

The vulva is the skin surface most frequently affected. Other areas that can be affected are the back, axilla and beneath the armpits.

\section*{2) Hypertrophic Dystrophies}

This is a benign epithelial thickening and hyperkeratosis due to chronic irritation caused by vulvo-vaginal infections

During the acute phase, as in diabetic vulvitis, the lesions may be red and moist which provides evidence of secondary infection. The lesion may involve any portion of the vulva, adjacent thighs, perineum or perineal skin.
* Invasive malignancies may also appear as white (patches) lesions of the skin of the vulva.
- A biopsy should be taken to rule out malignancy.
* Periodic examination of biopsies and the excision of more advanced lesions should be done.

\section*{Management}
- Pruritis, dyspareunia and urinary symptoms resulting from estrogen withdrawal responds well to local application of estrogenic creams.
- Specific treatment of vaginal infections if present
- Topical corticosteroids e.g. $0.01 \%$ Fluocinolone acetamide cream has proved helpful in hypertrophic lesions.
- A mixture of $1 \%$ hydrocortisone and $2-3 \%$ testosterone $3-4$ times a day has been found to be beneficial in the treatment of lichen sclerosis

NB -warn the patients not to apply an excess of testosterone because it may cause systemic vilirising effect in addition to an increase in hair growth.

\section*{Prognosis}

In absence of malignancy, the principal goal is to relieve symptoms which is mainly Pruritis and is good.
3) Bartholins cyst/Abscess

It rarely occurs.
A cyst is a painless swelling made up of accumulation of serum, while an abscess is a cyst complicated by infection and is painful. Commonest cause is gonorrhea. Gonococci causes obstruction of the Bartholins ducts. Another probable cause is congenital narrowing of the duct.

Signs
- Edematous and inflamed tissue around the Bartholins gland.
- Fluctuant mass usually palpable
- Small non inflamed cyst are asymptomatic unless progressive enlargement compromises the vaginal introitus or acute infection sets in

\section*{Treatment}
- Incision and drainage preferably marsupilization, which allows the abscess to drain properly thus preserving the function of the gland
- Appropriate antibiotics
- Analgesics for pain

\section*{Other benign lesions}
a) Granuloma lesions

This is a tissue reaction to germs. It may present as condylomatalata ( $3^{\text {rd }}$ stage syphilis). Investigations to be done include;
-VDRL
-Biopsy to rule out TB
Then give appropriate treatment.
b) Condylomata Accuminata (viral warts)
- treatment is by cauterization(burning)
- podophylin $20 \%$ to be applied
- a caustic pencil to burn

NB it reccurs-emphasise on prevention

\section*{Relaxation of Pelvic Support}

Please review;
A. The muscle of the pelvic floor
B. Functions of the pelvic floor muscles
C. Antenatal and post natal exercises

Relaxation of the pelvic floor supports results to either of the following;
1. Cystocele
2. Rectocele
3. Uterine prolapse

\section*{Cystocele}

This is herniation of the bladder through a weak anterior vaginal wall.

\section*{Classification/Degrees}

Mild Cystocele-this is where the anterior vaginal wall prolapses to the introitus up on straining.

Moderate Cystocele- this where vaginal wall extends beyond the introitus up on straining.

Severe Cystocele-this where the vaginal wall extends beyond the introitus in the resting state

\section*{Signs and symptoms}

A small Cystocele will cause no significant symptoms but if it is a large one, the following symptoms may be noticed:
- Bulging out of the vaginal introitus and make the patient to complain of pressure
- Protruding mass that gives a feeling that she is sitting on a ball
- Symptoms are aggrevated by vigorous activity, prolonged standing, coughing, sneezing or straining
- They are relieved by resting and assuming a recumbent position
- Urinary incompetence or incomplete bladder emptying feeling which may lead to frequent micturation

\section*{Investigations}
$\checkmark$ Urinalysis
$\checkmark$ X-ray
$\checkmark$ Cystoscopy

\section*{Management}
- If mild or moderate Cystocele-reassure the patient and advice on pelvic flour muscles exercises
- A woman in child bearing age should not have corrective surgery-it should be postponed till she has had her last delivery. They should be given conservative management which includes; -insertion of a pessary or tampon in the lower part of the vagina to provide temporary supportprolonged use may lead to pressure necrosis and vaginal lacerations.

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
-exercise in young patients will give a definite improvement of pressure symptoms. -estrogens in post menopausal women for several months may improve muscle tone greatly both in quality and vascularity.
- Surgical correction for large Cystocele that causes retention and recurrent bladder infection (Colophorhaphy-surgical repair of the vagina).

NB- No further pregnancies after this operation, and there fore, better for the mother to be done hysterectomy. More pregnancies would destroy bladder support.

\section*{Prevention}
1) Intrapartum and post partum exercises
2) Correction or avoidance of obesity, chronic coughs, straining and traumatic deliveries
3) Estrogen therapy to maintain muscular facial tissue after menopause and prevents or post pones the appearance of Cystocele and other forms of pelvic relaxation.

\section*{Prognosis}

Excellent after surgery in the absence of subsequent deliveries

\section*{Rectocele}

This is the herniation of the rectum through a weak posterior vaginal wall.

\section*{Causes}
$\star$ Disruption of the fibrous connection tissue (recto-vaginal fascia) between the rectum and vagina during child birth.
\$ Operative deliveries especially of large fetus or breech delivery.
* Slow involutional changes in the pelvic supporting tissues as a result of menopause.
* Bowel habits- life long chronic constipation

NB-Early and adequate episiotomy reduces the amount of damage to the recto-vaginal facia supporting tissues.

\section*{Clinical diagnosis}
- Difficult evacuation of faeces
- Sensation of vaginal fullness expressed as "falling out" pressure.
- Presence of soft reducible mass buldging into lower half of the posterior vaginal wall(flat lacerated perineal body)

\section*{Management}
- Digital extraction of impacted faeces
- Surgery (Colpoperineorrhaphy) after mother has had the desired number of children is usually curative.
- Advice patients to avoid straining, coughing and other strenuous activities to prevent constipation through proper diet, plenty of fluid in take and use of stool softeners and lubricating suppositories.
- Recurrences after surgical correction are rare after chronic constipation has been dealt with.
- Subsequent vaginal deliveries should be avoided- Elective $\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{S}$ is the option.

\section*{Uterine Prolapse}

This is abnormal protrusion of the uterus, the pelvic floor or genital hiatus (space or opening).

\section*{Classification}
$1^{\text {st }}$ degree-cervix is in the mid portion of the vagina
$2^{\text {nd }}$ degree-cervix is in the introitus/vaginal orifice
$3^{\text {rd }}$ degree-cervix is beyond the introitus. It is associated with necrosis and infection.

\section*{Causes}
* Prolonged labour especially in maltiparous
* Oestrogen deficiency like in menopause
* Sedentary life- common at coast especially with Arabs, Indians and a few Somalis.
* Congenital in the pokots-malnutrition
* Pelvic tumors
* Sacral nerve disorders especially injury, diabetic neuropathy, caudal anesthesia and pre-sacral tumor.

\section*{Symptoms}
- Heaviness in the vagina or hanging out of the vagina.
- Low backache
- Uterus may be visible at the vulva
- Firm mass palpable on the lower abdomen
- Painful intercourse
- Leucorrhea due to uterine engorgement
- Compression and distortion of the bladder leading to residual urine and hence UTI.

\section*{Complications}
1. Increased vaginal discharge
2. Abnormal uterine bleeding abortion as a result of infection
3. UTI
4. Hydronephrosis
5. Haemorrhoids due to straining especially with Rectocele

\section*{Prevention}
* Pre-natal and postnatal "kegel" exercises to strengthen levator muscles
- Early and adequate episiotomy during $2^{\text {nd }}$ stage
* Traumatic deliveries to be a voided at all cost
* Prolonged oestrogen administration to menopausal and post menopausal women
- Avoid sedentary life
- Avoid grande multiparity

\section*{Management}
- Surgical measures
- Hb levels and blood group
- Urea and urinalysis to detect to detect any other abnormalities
- Antibiotics
- Dressing especially for $3{ }^{\text {rd }}$ degree cases followed by vaginal hysterectomy
- For $1^{\text {st }}$ and $2^{\text {nd }}$ degrees and for women of reproductive age, Manchester repair is carried out.

This entails colophorhaphy and amputation of the cervix.
Medical measures include;
- Vaginal pessaries(inflatable doughnuts) as a palliative measure where surgical treatment is contra-indicated or as a temporary measure of mild to moderate prolapse
- Oestrogen therapy (systemically or vaginally) to post menopausal women to improve the muscle tone.
- D \& C may be necessary to investigate for malignancy if there is bleeding
- Vaginal creams and or medicated tampons
- UTI or cardiovascular complications to be treated appropriately
- Enema or laxatives to help with constipation
- Obese patients should cut down weight

\section*{Prognosis}
$\checkmark$ Vaginal hysterectomy with anterior posterior coloporhaphy provides excellent and permanent vaginal support and if good healing occurs, preservation of vaginal function as well.
$\checkmark$ Recurrences may result from unrepaired Cystocele and Rectocele or from occupational factors such as heavy lifting or straining.

\section*{Traumatic Disorders of the Genital Organs}

\section*{Introduction}

Injury to the genital organs may be as a result of gynecological or obstetrical surgery. Fistula may occur due to direct or indirect occlusion as a result of angulation or obstruction.

\section*{Vulva}

Injuries may be in the form of bruises or lacerations. If Oozing apply some pressure, but if bleeding it should be stitched.

\section*{Perineum}
- Injuries may include;
$1^{\text {st }}$ degree/primary tear-involves the vaginal mucosa
$2^{\text {nd }}$ degree/secondary tear-involves vaginal mucosa and the skin
The above two types of tears are repaired by midwives
$3^{\text {rd }}$ degree tear- involves the vaginal mucosa, the skin and the muscles repair by doctor.
- Give timely episiotomy to prevent tears.
- Tears are termed as "fresh" within 24 hours of occurrence and can be repaired. After 48 hours they are termed as old and cannot be repaired until healed.

\section*{Vagina}

Injuries of the vagina may be bruises or lacerations. If oozing place a vaginal pack, if bleeding suture under GA

\section*{Cervix}

Injuries of the cervix may be in the form of bruises, lacerations and or tears. If oozing place a vaginal pack. Tears with active bleeding will be repaired under GA. Un repaired cervical tears will cause cervical incompetence resulting to mid trimester abortions

\section*{Uterus}

Uterus may be perforated as a result of poor technique of IUCD insertion or D\&C. Rupture may be partial or total. Repair is done for perforation or partial rupture. Total rupture will need subtotal abdominal hysterectomy.

\section*{Prevention}

Avoid prolonged labour; ensure that labour are completed within 12 hours of active labour

\section*{Fistulae}

Fistulae are abnormal opening between two internal hollow organs. These are;
1. Vescico-vaginal fistulae (VVF)-opening between vagina and bladder.

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
2. Recto-vaginal fistulae (RVF)-opening between vagina and rectum.

\section*{Vescico-Vaginal Fistulae (VVF)}

This type of fistulae leads to vulval excoriation by urine burns. It determines the urinary incontinence.

\section*{Sites of VVF}
1. Juxta-urethral fistula-involves the bladder neck and the proximal part of the urethra. The urinary sphincter is usually damaged. The urethral incontinence may be serious even after successful closure of the fistulae.
2. Mid-vaginal fistulae-it is less common, it is easy to repair as it is easily accessible.
3. Juxta-cervical- opens on either side of the vaginal anterior fornix
4. Massive fistulae (circumferential) - is a combination of all the types described above.

NB-urinary fistulae can occur at any site

\section*{Recto-Vaginal Fistulae}

This type of fistulae may be found either on the lower or the upper half of the vagina. If they happen to be on the lower part then it leads to incontinence of flatus only, or fluid faeces. If the fistulae are on the upper half, it will cause more serious problems i.e. faeces being passed continuously per vagina.

\section*{Cause of Fistulae}
$\star$ Obstructed labour leading to necrosis
* Radio-therapy, many years after treatment
* Disease process e.g. carcinoma in advanced stages
* Chronic TB or Syphilis
* Congenital fistulae-an accessory ectopic urethra which open into the vagina. Can be recognized in childhood
* RVF caused by unrepaired 3 degree tear of perineum or broken down repairs or advanced cancer, but is rare.

\section*{Signs and symptoms of}

\section*{VVF}
- Complains of constant dribbling of urine from the vagina and generally does not pass urine in the normal route.
- On inspection with Sim's speculum, the fistulae is located in the midline half way up the anterior vaginal wall secondary to prolonged labour, fistula secondary to operation are usually high up.
- A small fistula admits a probe with difficulty but may be seen on Cystoscopy. Large fistulae will admit 1 or 2 fingers.

To confirm the diagnosis, run methylene blue fluid into the bladder through a catheter and note if it immediately flows out into the vagina.
- Lack of sexual enjoyment
- Psychogenic amenorrhea
- Vulval excoriation $2^{0}$ to burns by urine
- Psychological trauma -feeling like social outcast.

RVF
- If a fistula is small, only mucus from the rectum may leak into the vagina. if large faeces and flatus escape in to the vagina.
- Patient will complain of feculent vaginal discharge
- Inspection of posterior vaginal wall by use of a probe will demonstrate small fistulae
- Perineal excoriation due to leakage of urine and fecal matter

\section*{Management of VVF and RVF}

\section*{Prevention}
- Avoid prolonged labour i.e. labour should not go beyond 12 hours.
- Frequent emptying of bladder during labour
- Control infection and excoriation
- In destructive delivery due to prolonged labour leave catheter insitu for 48-7 days.
- VVF recently formed fistulae will heal if bladder is drained continuously for 21-28 days and for RVF, low residue diet given for the same period.
- Where surgery is indicated, it is important that fresh VVF is repaired at once, if not it should be left for 2-3 months before repair is done. This allows local damage and infection to settle and UTI to be eradicated.
- Most VVF can be closed by operation via the vaginal route.

\section*{Pre-operative care}
- Blood for Hb level, urea and IVP for ureteric fistula.
- EUA to detect type of fistula
- Dye test (methylene blue) into the bladder to detect site of fistulae
- Proper nutrition to ensure physical fitness
- A lot of support and encouragement needed by patient

\section*{Specific post operative care}
- Secure constant drainage of the bladder to enable the repair to heal well
- Catheter to remain insitu for 10-14 days
- Give analgesic for pain
- Antibiotics prophylactically
- Proper nutrition with increased intake of vitamin C and proteins but low residue
- Maintain local cleanliness by douching, enema and warm perinea irrigation
- RVF is repaired after a course of antibiotics to reduce bowel infection

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
- Sterilize the gut with cabbracol 500 mg B.d for 5 days
- Give enema on the morning of operation
- After operation, pace patient on liquid diet for 2 weeks.
- Liquid paraffin 10 mls for 2 weeks.
- Other general post operative care- observations, hygiene etc NB
After fistulae repair patient should always opt for elective C/S.

\section*{Vacuum Extraction (Ventouse) Delivery}

Younge invented the basic idea for the vacuum extractor in 1706 when he used a glass suction cup. In 1849, Simpson designed the instrument, but at the time it was hardly used. In 1774 Mostron introduced the modern vacuum extractor. There are opinions about the value in assisting delivery by this method and it is rarely used these days.

\section*{Indications for vaccum delivery:}
- Mild foetal distress
- Delay in second stage of labour
- Malposition; occipital lateral and occipital posterior positions
- Maternal exhaustion

\section*{The Procedure}

The following steps should be followed when conducting this procedure:
- Reassure the mother and explain the necessity of this procedure
- The paediatrician should be present
- Explain to the mother that the baby will have chignon (an area of oedema and bruising where the cup is applied) but this will disappear after some hours
- Equipment as for normal delivery with the addition of vacuum equipment
- The mother should be placed in the lithotomy position
- The doctor should assemble the cup and tubing
- The nurse attaches the distal end to the suction
- The doctor should then swab and prepare the mother
- Catheterisation is done to empty the bladder
- The perineum should be infiltrated with $1 \%$ lignocaine
- The cup should be dipped in sterile water then introduced sideways into the vagina by pressing backwards against the perineum
- It is placed on the scalp as near as possible to the posterior fontanelle
- Care should be taken not to trap the cervix or the vaginal wall under the cup

While the doctor holds the cup in the correct position:
- The pressure causes an artificial caput succedaneum or chignon, when vacuum reaches
$0.8 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{cm}$ the cup is completely filled with scalp
- Traction on the handle should be made as nearly vertically to the cup as possible as oblique direction may pull the cup off
- The nurse uses the hand pump to create vacuum gradually
- Increase negative pressure by $0.2 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{cm}$ at one minute interval until $0.8 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{cm}$ is attained the procedure continues as follows:
- Intermittent traction is applied with uterine contraction Direction of pull changes as the head descends through the birth canal
- When crowning takes place episiotomy is performed if necessary
- The use of ventouse should be reconsidered if there is no obvious descent after three to four contractions
- To prevent damage to the scalp, the vacuum is reduced as slowly as it was created after delivery of the head by opening the screw release valve
- The cup is then detached
- Should the cup detach itself, it is probably due to pulling in the wrong direction or using too much force
- A vacuum should be created again and if the chignon is large, then another area on the scalp is used

\section*{Remember:}

Never use the cup actively to rotate the baby's head during the procedure. Do not continue this procedure for more than 30 minutes.

\section*{complications}

Failure of the procedure,Trauma to the foetal scalp Chignon, that is, oedema and bruising where the cup had been applied which can occasionally get infected Some babies develop cephallohaematoma
Intracranial haemorrhage
Necrosis of the scalp
Aponeurotic haematoma
These complications occur mainly due to some degree of disproportion where the cup has been applied for long period and forceful traction used.

\section*{Forceps Delivery}

This procedure is performed by a forceps which is an instrument that has two parts that cross each other like scissors and lock at the intersection. The lock may be of sliding type or of screw type. Each part consists of a handle, a lock, a shank and a blade. The blade is joined to the handle by a shank.
The blade has two curves, cephalic curve to fit the head, and pelvic curve that correspond with the curved axis of the pelvis. The length of the handles differ, so do the types of handles. There are several types of forceps including

Kielland's, Simpson's, Wrigley's, Neville-

Barne's, Haig-Fwerguson's, Milne-Murray and Diper forceps among others.

\section*{Types of Forceps Delivery}

\section*{Low Forceps}

Today the majority of forceps delivery is carried out when the foetal head is on the perineal floor whereby the internal rotation may have already occurred. This is called outlet forceps or low forceps delivery.

\section*{Mid Forceps}

This is when the head is higher in the pelvis but engaged and the greater diameter has passed the inlet. This is known as mid forceps.

\section*{High Forceps}

If the head is not engaged, the procedure is termed high forceps. This is an extremely difficult and dangerous operation. A caesarean section is usually preferred to mid/high forceps.

What conditions have to be present for a forceps delivery?

\section*{Conditions considered for forceps delivery include:}
- Presentation must be suitable
- Head has to be engaged
- The pelvic outlet needs to be adequate
- Good uterine contraction
- Membranes should be ruptured
- Bladder must be empty

\section*{steps taken before the application of forceps}

Reassure the mother and explain the procedure.
- Obtain consent from the mother.
- Some form of analgesia is given.

Pundental or epidural block is preferred to general anaesthesia.
- Ensure requirements for catheterisation, episiotomy and perineal sutures are at hand.
- Resuscitation trolley must be ready.
- Delivery trolley should be ready as for spontaneous delivery.

The specific type of forceps as per doctor's requirement.
Procedure
- The mother is given analgesia and placed in the lithotomy position.
- The vulva is swabbed and draped.
- Catheterisation is done.
- The physician checks the exact position of the foetal head by vaginal examination.
- The fingers of the right hand are passed in the vagina.
- The left blade is applied first and held by the left hand between the fingers and thumbs of the left hand.
- The blade is then passed between the head and the palm or surface of the right fingers. The handle is carried backwards towards the middle well over the mother's abdomen to the right side almost parallel with her right inguinal ligament.
- The above position of the blade will ensure the instrument follows the directions of both the pelvic and cephalic curve.
- After ascertaining it lies in the correct position next to the head, the fingers of the right hand are withdrawn.
The same procedure is carried out on the right side. The external visible portion will be above the blade.

\section*{Positioning the Forceps}

The shanks are pressed backwards against the perineum and the handle should lock and lie in a horizontal position. If the handle does not lock, the blades should be removed and the position of the head re-examined.
The ordinary curved forceps, if correctly applied on the foetal head, results in the fenestrate, 'window' of the blade lying over the pariental eminence. The fingers of the right hand resting on the cheek, guide the tip of the blade.

\section*{The Delivery Procedure}

Before applying traction, ascertain that the cervix is not nipped between the
foetal head an the forceps blade. Traction is applied during contractions, which should not exceed 15 seconds. Encourage the mother to push with every contraction. The lock on the handle should be loosened between contractions to reduce the skull pressure. Continuously heart. The direction of pull is altered as the head descends to follow the curve of birth canal. If the head is mid cavity the direction of the pull is outwards.
The blades lie in submento vertical while the biparietal diameter is grasped. As the head descends, the handles are gradually raised to about $45^{\circ}$ above the horizontal, and then episiotomy is performed through a stretched perineum. The head is then gently guided through the vulva until crowning takes place. The handles of the forceps should be in vertical position. After the head is properly crowned and ready for extension, the forceps are removed.
The face is delivered by manual extension of the head.

You should note that the forceps delivery poses several dangers both to the mother and baby.
In the case of the mother dangers arise from:
- Anaesthesia
- Laceration of cervix, vagina or perineum
- Postpartum haemorrhage
- Puerperium infection

In the case of the baby, danger may arise as a result of:
- Intra cranial haemorrhage
- Facial palsy
- Cephalohaematoma

Piper Forceps for Breech Delivery of After coming Head

The Piper forceps is used electively as a substitute in case of failure of Mauriceau Smellie-Veit manoeuvre for delivery of the foetal head. The forceps are applied after delivery of the shoulder while the head is in the pelvis. The body and the arms are suspended with a towel.

The left blade is introduced in an upward direction along the foetal head. The same is done to apply the right forceps.
The forceps are locked in place and the position of the head is confirmed by palpation. An episiotomy is performed in case it had not been done earlier.
Traction is applied until the chin the mouth and nose emerge over the perineum. The forceps are removed and the mother is instructed to pant so that the head is delivered slowly.

\section*{Caesarean Section}

Caeserian section is the delivery of the foetus through an incision made on the abdominal wall and uterus. It is considered a major abdominal surgery. The diminished danger of caesarean.
Indications
- Maternal or foetal distress during labour
- Pelvic tumour
- Diabetes mellitus
- Cephalopelvic disproportion
- Severe high blood pressure
- Abnormal uterine action
- Haemolytic diseases
- Failed induction
- Placenta previa
- Antepartum haemorrhage
- Gross disproportions
- Cervical or vaginal stenosis
- Fault in birth canal
- Double uterus
- Impacted mentoposterior
- Foetal malpresentation
- Shoulder presentation
- Breech presentation
types of caesarean section
Lower segment section, which is the operation of choice
Classical section
Extraperitonial caesarean section
Caesarean hysterectomy
The main advantages of lower segment
section are:
- Blood loss is minimal
- Incision is easy to repair
section is the delivery of the foetus through an incision made on the abdominal wall and uterus. It is considered a major abdominal surgery. The diminished danger of caesarean section has made it widely used and even wing are indications of The risk of rupture during labour is lessened as the lower uterine segment has less uterine activity
- The operation is associated with lower incidence of postoperative infection Lower Segment Caesarean Section
The following steps make up the procedure to be followed in the lower segment section:
- The bladder is emptied by catheterisation.
- Intravenous glucose saline is started
(kept ready).
- The operation table is tilted to prevent compression of inferior vena cava.
- A transverse or vertical incision is made out of the lower subumbilical to open the peritoneal cavity.
- At the end of the wound a wide retractor is inserted.
- To push the bladder off from the lower segment, the uterovesical pouch is divided transversely for about 10 cm .
- A transverse incision about 2 cm long is made in the middle of the lower segment.
- Deepen until the membranes bulge.
- If possible the amnion sack should be kept intact.

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
- The incision is extended to 10 cm by exerting traction using two index fingers at the incision.
- The membranes are ruptured.
- The hand is then slipped beside the head and the first blade of Wringley's forceps is applied, and the other follows.
- As the head is delivered gently with the forceps, the anaesthetist injects ten units of syntocinon intravenously.
- The shoulders are eased out carefully to avoid lateral splitting of the uterine wound.
- The delivered foetus is held upside down, the air passage cleared by suctioning.
- The cord is clamped and cut and the baby is handed to the assistant for further care.
- The placenta separates immediately and is delivered through the wound.
- The uterine incision is sutured with two layers with catgut or dexon.
- Any blood, liquor, vernix is removed from the peritoneal cavity and the wound closed.

\section*{Classical Caesarean Section}

The incision is made directly into the wall of the body of the uterus. The procedure is rarely performed, its indications are:
- Gestation of less than 32 weeks (i.e before the lower segment has formed)
- Placenta previa which is anteriorly situated
- An hour glass contraction (constriction ring)

It is always performed through a midline incision.

\section*{Extra Peritoneal Caesarean Section}

\section*{Procedure}

Access to the lower uterine segment is secured by appropriate dissection of tissues around the bladder to by pass the peritoneal cavity and the baby is extracted. As the peritoneal cavity is not disturbed there is no risk of introducing infection from infected liquor or infection from the uterus. This was a popular procedure in the pre-antibiotic era but is now outdated.

\section*{Caesarean Section Hysterectomy}

This is also known as Porro's Operation. The removal of the uterus follows after caesarean section, due to other conditions of the uterus; such as placenta accreta, multiple fibroid tumours of the uterus and so on. On rare occasions and in conjuction with other gynaecological disorders this operation may be used for sterilisation purposes.

\section*{Elective Caesarean Section}

The decision to deliver by caesarean section is made during pregnancy before the onset of labour. Some reasons for this decision are absolute while others depend on combination of factors and the opinion of the obstetrician.

\section*{Emergency Caesarean Section}

This operation is performed when adverse conditions develop during labour. The psychological preparation of the mother for the operation is of paramount importance. You should be prepared to deal with the different feelings of different mothers. An opportunity should be given to mothers to explore and express their feelings, be they fear, disappointment or frustration. This can be done in a group or individual counselling setting, where uncertainties and misunderstandings can be clarified. The nurse can be of great help acting as a mediator, fostering acceptance and sense of readiness to both the apprehensive mother and her partner

Pre-Operative Care For Elective

\section*{Caesarean Section}

The following are characteristic of pre-operative
care during an elective caesarean section:
- The doctor explains the procedure to the mother and her partner and consent is obtained.
- Physical examination is carried out to make sure the mother is fit for general
anaesthesia
- Blood for haemoglobin, cross match and two pints of blood are kept ready.
- Mother is admitted and not fed overnight. Sodium amytal ( 200 mg ) is given to ensure a good night's sleep.
- The abdomen is cleaned in the morning.
- A bath is taken in the morning.
- A retention catheter is inserted to ensure an empty bladder through the operation.
- An intravenous infusion is started as per prescription.
- Valuables are kept safely.
- Nail polish, dentures, glasses or contact lenses are removed.
- Theatre gown, leggings and scarf are put on the mother.
- Pre-operative medication is usually administered half an hour before the operation (1m atropine and analgesic).
- Foetal heart, foetal position, and presentation are determined.
- Maternal observations are recorded: pulse, respiration, blood pressure and temperature.
- A urinalysis is carried out for albumin sugar.

Unanticipated Caesarean Section

In such a situation, the mother's anxiety will be high. Reassure the mother and explain the reasons for surgery. The procedure is the same as outlined for elective Caesarean but if food has been consumed, gastric lavage should be performed

\section*{Post Operative Care}

This is the same care given to any woman who has undergone a major abdominal operation.

The mother should breast feed as soon as her condition permits. If for any reason she cannot breast feed, the breast should manually be expressed from the third day to prevent engorgement of the breasts. Four hourly vulva swabbing should be taken if the patient is confined to bed.
Remember that maternal mortality is four times greater than in normal labour. Elective sections
usually have lower mortality rates but emergency cases are usually at high risk, especially due to the use of anaesthesia.

Mothers who were in labour for a prolonged period are especially at risk of serious infection;
so prophylactic antibiotics should always be
used. A ruptured uterus is more rare here than in the lower segment section. All mothers with a caesarean section scar should be delivered in the hospital under vigilant observation.

The foetus is also at risk, given that respiratory problems may occur due to the anaesthesia.
Intracranial damage may occur as a result of improper care during the delivery of the foetal head, which has to be brought up from the pelvis or through the small uterine incision.
Obstetric emergencies may occur suddenly or may be due to poor management or negligence on the part of the skilled medical personnel. be vigilant in observations in an effort to avoid such emergencies. When they do happen, be ready to respond in order to save lives and reduce morbidity and mortality

\section*{SHIRODIKAR STITCH /MACDONALD CIRCLAGE}

Apurse string stitch put in the cervix to keep it tightly closed during pregnancy.

This procedure helps prevent a miscarriage or premature birth
when the cervix has been weakened
- Assessment of the cervix is done to assess the strength of the cervix.
- Insertion of the stitch is usually done at 10-14 weeks gestation.
- WHO IS AT RISK
- persons with bacterial infections eg syphilis, viral infections eg hpv
- $2^{\text {nd }}$ trimester surgical abortions
- Congenitally weakened cervix can occur if mother was treated with diethylstilbestrol for breast cancer during pregnancy.
- Birth trauma that damages the cervix

\section*{GYNAECOLOGY:}
- On stitch insertion the woman maintains total bedrest for 24hours.
- Ensure no uterine contractions before discharge.
- Resume activity resumption gradually
- Avoid sexual intercourse.

Minimise the risk of infection
