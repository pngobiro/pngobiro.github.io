                        <p>The management of neoplasms follows the same general measures that you have been looking at throughout this unit. Can you remember them?</p>
                        <p>The first step is to take a detailed history. Your investigations should include routine laboratory data like haemoglobin, urea, blood group, urinalaysis and so on. You should also conduct an Examination Under Anesthesia (EUA) where a biopsy is taken to detect the type of cancer and staging.</p>
                        <p>Following this, treatment may take several forms. Surgery may be palliative in the late stages and in cases where the tumour mass is reduced. Radical surgery is performed in the early stages and involves the whole organ/system being removed. This procedure is sometimes curative.</p>
                        <p>Chemotherapy involves the administration of anti-cancer drugs. Radiotherapy is usually recommended in the advanced stage. More often, a combination of all the aforementioned treatments is used.</p>

                            <p>Genital cancers in women account for 5% of the reproductive organ cancers. The benign lesions (tumours) of the vulva include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Bartholin's cyst/abscess which is the most common.</li>
                                <li>Granuloma lesions which arise as a reaction to germs due to condylomata lata in third stage tissue reaction, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis and/or condylomata acuminata due to viral warts.</li>
                                <li>Very rarely carcinoma may arise in Bartholin's gland.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Another rare tumour of the vulva is basal cell carcinoma (rodent ulcer), which grows slowly and does not metastasise although it infiltrates locally.</p>
                            <p>The symptoms and signs that are diagnostic in neoplastic conditions of the vulva are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ulcer or swelling, soreness or irritations are early signs.</li>
                                <li>Slight bleeding may occur.</li>
                                <li>Later, there is a purulent discharge, which becomes very offensive.</li>
                                <li>Enlarged inguinal glands may breakdown and ulcerate and occasionally severe haemorrhage may occur from erosion of femoral vessels.</li>
                                <li>Diagnosis is made by biopsy taken for histologic examination.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention</h4>
                            <p>Early biopsy should be done in suspicious cases in women with leukoplakia and itching.</p>

                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prognosis</h4>
                            <p>The prognosis depends on the stage at which the condition is first diagnosed. It is usually worse when glands are involved. The size of the lesion affects the outcome. Lesions that are less than 2 cm in diameter have twice as good a prognosis as larger tumours. If the tumour is first detected when it is small, with no palpable glands, then it can be completely removed with the glands and the patient has a 75% chance of surviving up to five years.</p>

                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                            <p>For cancer of the vulva, treatment will include examination under anaesthesia after which a biopsy is taken, and staging done. Surgery may involve the radical excision of the vulva and of the inguinal and femoral glands on both sides, especially if it is undertaken in the late stage.</p>
                            <p>Alternatively, an excision and biopsy may be done. Radiotherapy is performed on tumours at the fourchette because of involvement of the anal canal. This may be curative in the early stages.</p>

                            <p>A urethra carbuncle is a small, bright red swelling at the urethral orifice, usually occurring in menopausal women. Some carbuncles cause no symptoms but most are very tender, and may cause dyspareunia or pain on micturition. They are not neoplastic but probably result from chronic infection of the paraurethral glands in the floor of the urethra.</p>
                            <p>Treatment is by excision or destruction by diathermy. Carcinoma of the urethra is a rare tumour but if it occurs, it is usually a squamous cell carcinoma arising near the meatus. It may sometimes be an adenocarcinoma arising in the paraurethral glands.</p>

                            <p>The benign tumours here include <dfn id="condylomata-acuminata">condylomata acuminata</dfn>, which are also known as venereal genital warts. This is caused by the human papilloma virus and is transmitted through genital contact.</p>
                            <p>The originally small papillary growths tend to coalesce and form large cauliflower-like masses, which proliferate profusely during pregnancy. The growths may aggregate into a large mass that may even block the introitus during late delivery. Secondary infection is common. These venereal warts usually regress markedly during puerperium and may even disappear. The virus does not affect the foetus.</p>

                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                            <p>The most effective drug is fluorouracil, recommended for use only during non-pregnant state because it is noxious to the foetus. The gravida with this condition should be treated by cryotherapy or excision of the lesions. Improved vaginal hygiene is also beneficial.</p>
                            <p>Fibromyoma is another benign tumour which may occasionally arise in the vaginal wall. It is hard and smooth and can easily be enucleated. Another possible tumour is endometriosis, a condition that has already been discussed in section two of this unit.</p>
                            <p>Carcinoma of the vagina is rare and, if it occurs, it is usually of the squamous type. Cancer of the cervix very commonly spreads to the vaginal vault. In the case of endometrial carcinoma, isolated vaginal metastases may occur.</p>
                            <p>Patients with cancer of the vagina complain of bleeding, especially after coitus and later, an offensive watery discharge. The growth may ulcerate forming a fistula into the rectum or vagina.</p>

                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                            <p>Treatment is often very unsatisfactory. Most cases are treated by local application of radium or caesium and external irradiation of the lymphatic glands of the pelvis. The only alternative treatment is extensive operation to remove the whole vagina, uterus and pelvic lymphatic glands. If the rectum is involved, it is also removed and colostomy established.</p>

                            <p>The benign tumours here are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Polyps</li>
                                <li>Fibroids</li>
                                <li>Nabothian follicles (which are often a result of infection)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The carcinomas include adenocarcinoma, which is common, and squamous, which is less common.</p>
                            <p>Carcinoma of the cervix is a common genital malignancy. It begins in the cervix at the margin of the external os where it stays for sometime before it begins to penetrate the neighbouring tissues. It extends outwards towards the pelvic wall, downwards into the vagina, backwards to the rectum and forwards to the bladder.</p>

                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Signs and Symptoms</h4>
                            <p>The affected patient is likely to be between 30 to 40 years of age and the signs and symptoms may present with:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Post-coital bleeding because the penis rubs on the ulcerated cervix.</li>
                                <li>Post-menopausal bleeding. Any woman who resumes bleeding per vagina after menstruation had ceased should suspect the possibility of cancer of the cervix.</li>
                                <li>Offensive purulent discharge per vagina will indicate infection of the necrotic surfaces of the tumour.</li>
                                <li>Pain in the lower abdomen or back (this is a very late symptom).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Risk factors include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Early age (usually below 18 years) of first coitus.</li>
                                <li>Multiple sexual partners.</li>
                                <li>Viral infections like Herpes Simplex Type II.</li>
                                <li>High parity, that is, above five children.</li>
                                <li>Poor hygiene, whereby dirt collects in the vagina or in the foreskin of uncircumcised men.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention</h4>
                            <p>As mentioned earlier, prevention includes educating women of a reproductive age to be aware of the signs and symptoms of the condition, which will enable them to seek early treatment. Also women should be encouraged to take the Papanicolaou test every year.</p>

                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                            <p>Initial diagnosis should follow these steps:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Take the patient's history</li>
                                <li>Physical examination</li>
                                <li>Perform a biopsy</li>
                                <li>In the early stage, a Pap smear test will help discover whether the condition is curable</li>
                                <li>Examination Under Anaesthesia (EUA) in order to conduct the biopsy and do staging</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>After a diagnosis has been made, treatment should be given. Surgery involves radical hysterectomy in the early stages or may be necessary in combination with radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is either external (pelvis) or intracavity (caecium in the uterine cavity).</p>
                            <p>The prognosis is best in the early stages of the disease. Survival from the five year time frame and beyond is very poor. Complications of radiotherapy include relapses, ovarian failure, RVF and VVF.</p>

                            <p>The ovary is the only organ in the body that is capable of producing many varieties of tumours. The majority of them are cystic and benign. Some are highly malignant and some produce oestrogen with symptoms of menorrhagia.</p>
                            <p>The cysts of the ovarian follicle or corpus luteum are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Follicular cysts symptoms vary from no symptoms to pain and/or haemorrhage - they may not be palpable however. Occasionally a follicular cyst may reach the size of a tennis ball and it may then cause discomfort and be palpable on vaginal examination.</li>
                                <li>Lutein and theca lutein cysts are lined by cells of the corpus luteum type and may arise from either granulosa or theca. They look yellowish like the corpus luteum and the most common type is the corpus luteum cyst.</li>
                                <li>Blood cysts whereby there is bleeding into the follicular cyst, a corpus luteum or a neoplasm in the ovary. If the blood has been shed for some time, it will be thicker and darker than normal blood. In this case the name of 'chocolate' or 'tarry' cyst is often given.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Benign ovarian neoplasms include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Mucinous cystadenoma, which is the most common of all ovarian neoplasms and can reach an enormous size and distend most of the abdomen. They can occur at any age but are rare before puberty.</li>
                                <li>Serous cystadenoma is a common type of benign new growth. It has a smooth lining, which may be confused with a large follicular cyst at operation.</li>
                                <li>Dermoid cyst or benign teratoma may contain almost any type of tissue derived from two or more of the primary germ layers, that is, endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. They are mixed together in an irregular pattern. A dermoid cyst may occur at any age but is most common during reproductive age and particularly between the ages of 20 and 30 years.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Malignant tumours of the ovary are the third most common tumours affecting the genital tract. The first is cancer of the uterus, followed by cancer of the cervix.</p>
                            <p>Ovarian cancer tends to spread quietly around the peritoneum of the pelvis and to the alimentary canal. It infiltrates the omentum, too, should that structure adhere to it. The prognosis is usually poor due to its silent nature. When the tumour spreads to other organs, there will be symptoms referable to them.</p>
                            <p>Complications of ovarian tumours in order of frequency include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Torsion, that is, the tumour can twist on its pedicle as long as it is not fixed to any surrounding structure. The patient complains of pain in the lower abdomen, which may start after sudden movement, or slow onset of pain. When the torsion is rapid, the pain is severe and patient may vomit repeatedly. On examination, the abdomen is tender but not rigid as in peritonitis. There is a firm tender lump, which is separated from the uterus on abdominal and bimanual examination.</li>
                                <li>Rupture of the cyst may occur spontaneously. This is a serious matter and an immediate laparotomy should be done if the cyst is large and feels like it is going to rupture.</li>
                                <li>Haemorrhage, especially small haemorrhages into the ovarian cyst, is common. Most of them seem to cause no symptoms but are only seen at laparostomy. Occasionally a massive haemorrhage may take place in a cyst, particularly a malignant one and may cause pain similar to that of torsion.</li>
                                <li>Infection is not very common but a cyst may be involved in any local inflammatory process such as appendicitis diverticulitis.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                            <p>This may take several forms. If surgery is indicated, the surgeon may be faced with various possibilities. These include a cystectomy of either one ovary or bilateral ovary with removal of the opposite ovary or removal of ovaries, tubes and uterus. Surgery may, alternatively, involve the removal of as much malignant tissue as possible or the biopsy of an inoperable mass.</p>
                            <p>A cystectomy involves the shelling of the benign tumour out of its ovarian bed, leaving behind normal ovarian tissue, which will continue its function of ovulation and production of hormones.</p>

                                <p>Torsion and rupture of a cyst is an acute surgical emergency. The ovary and tube must be removed.</p>

                            <p>The benign tumour that is the most common growth in the uterus of women is the fibroid (fibromyoma). This tumour arises in the muscular wall of the uterus.

                            </figure>
                            <p>The different varieties of uterine fibroids include:</p>
                            <h5>Interstitial</h5>
                            <p>Interstitial, which begin as small nodules in the myometrium. When they increase in size, they tend to extrude towards the peritoneal surface or into the uterine cavity. There is increased menstrual loss due to enlargement of the uterine body.</p>
                            <h5>Subserous</h5>
                            <p>Subserous (subperitoneal) fibroids lie outside of the uterus and are covered with peritoneum. They are usually multiple, ranging from small nodules on the surface of the uterus to enormous masses weighing up to 20 kgs or more. They tend to grow up into the abdomen and may become pendunculated so that on bimanual examination, the tumour seems to be separated from the uterus and feel like an ovarian tumour.</p>
                            <h5>Submucous</h5>
                            <p>Submucous (subendometrial) fibroids are near the endometrium or hang into the cavity in which case they form a polyp with a long pedicle. The stalk of the polyp contains a few blood vessels, which nourish it. The uterine cavity may contract and hence the cervix dilates and expels the polyp through it.</p>
                            <h5>Cervical Fibroids</h5>
                            <p>Cervical fibroids are rare. Only 2% of uterine fibroids arise in the cervix. Usually it is a single tumour, although there may be other tumours in the body of the uterus. This type of tumour will cause distortion and elongation of the cervical canal and displace the body of uterus upwards. A large one may cause retention of urine.</p>
                            <p>The development of uterine fibroids is related to the action of oestrogen in a way not well understood. They arise during the period of menstrual activity although there are rarely symptoms before the age of 25 years.</p>
                            <p>The fibroids are more commonly found in nulliparous women or women who have not been pregnant for some time. They tend to occur three times more frequently in black women than in white women and occur at earlier age in the former. Reasons for this are not known.</p>

                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Common Symptoms</h5>
                            <p>First of all, it is important to note that there may be no symptoms in a woman with uterine fibroids. The condition may simply be discovered during a routine examination. However, the following signs and symptoms may be apparent:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>An abdominal tumour is sometimes the first thing that the patient notices. It is not tender and rarely gives rise to pain, but occasionally causes local discomfort and a feeling of weight.</li>
                                <li>Menorrhagia is a common reason for the patient to seek medical advice. Periods increase in amount and duration and may be accompanied by clots, but cycles are regular.</li>
                                <li>Pain is not a common symptom but when it occurs, it is generally an indication that there is associated endometriosis or PID or some complications like torsion. There may be colicky pain while a fibryomatous polyp is being extruded through the cervix by uterine contractions.</li>
                                <li>Frequency and retention of urine, especially with a large tumour pressing on the bladder.</li>
                                <li>Affects child bearing, mostly because it tends to cause abortion. Also, submucous growth projecting into and distending the uterine cavity and interstitial tumours may obstruct labour.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Keep in mind that physical signs will vary with size, position and number of tumours and may include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Asymmetrical enlargement of the uterus, which is found with a submucous growth projecting into and distending the uterine cavity.</li>
                                <li>The uterus feels harder than it does when the enlargement is due to pregnancy.</li>
                                <li>Not tender on palpation, unless the tumour is undergoing red degeneration.</li>
                                <li>Uterine souffl√© (a soft blowing sound made by the blood within the arteries of the gravid uterus) similar to that of pregnancy, may occasionally be heard on auscultation.</li>
                                <li>On pelvic examination the cervix may be found to be pushed down or displaced to one side.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Infertility is usually a common presenting problem when the fibroid is discovered during routine examination.</p>

                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h5>
                            <p>For small benign tumours that are not causing symptoms, no treatment is required but the patient should be re-examined regularly (every six to twelve months). If the tumour is found to be increasing in size, it should be treated. The patient and family (especially spouse) should be counselled on the effects of the tumour on menstruation, menopause and libido. Usually, such tumours cease to grow once menopause has been reached. At this point they grow slowly and seldom become malignant.</p>
                            <p>Surgical treatment is definitely indicated in case of heavy or prolonged bleeding caused by large tumours, even if they are not causing problems, and especially in young women because further growth is probable. It is also necessary in cases where there is possible malignant change, such as a tumour, which grows after the menopause, where the tumour leads to retention of urine or obstructs labour or if the tumour has undergone torsion.</p>
                            <p>An operation is necessary in the above conditions for the recovery or preservation of the patient's health. However, there are also other alternatives available. Myomectomy is the removal of the fibroid, where the uterus is retained. This is indicated when the woman wishes to keep her uterus and also in cases of infertility whereby no other cause of sterility can be found. Hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus with the fibroid. This procedure is indicated in patients who are 40 years of age and above.</p>
                            <p>Pre and post-operative care are the same as for any other major surgery.</p>

                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Prognosis</h5>
                            <p>Surgical therapy is curative. Pregnancy is possible after multiple myomectomy. Premature menopause will not occur in a well-executed hysterectomy, where the ovaries are retained.</p>

                            <p>Common malignancies affecting the female are those of the breast and uterus.

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The breast is the most common site of carcinoma in women aged 40 to 44 years of age and the leading cause of death. Most often, the general surgeon will handle growths or lesions in the breast. However, it is important for you to learn how these conditions present, associated risk factors and their management and follow up.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Some of the following factors are most commonly associated with increased risks of breast cancer. They include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Heredity, although the mechanism of inheritance is not clear. Studies have shown that women whose mothers or sisters have had cancer of the breast are two to three times more likely to develop the disease.</li>
                            <li>Marital status and parity, where single and nulliparous women have a slightly higher incidence of breast cancer than married and parous women. Women with three or more children have a lower incidence than women with fewer children.</li>
                            <li>Mammary dysplasia or cystic disease of the breast, particularly when accompanied by proliferative change, papillomatosis or solid hyperplasia is associated with increased incidence of cancer.</li>
                            <li>A woman with cancer in one breast is at risk of developing cancer in the opposite breast.</li>
                            <li>Women with cancer of the uterus and/or the ovary face an almost doubled risk of developing breast cancer when compared with the general population.</li>
                            <li>Significant percentages of women with breast cancer may have abnormal hormonal environment.</li>
                            <li>Oral contraceptives and menopausal oestrogen may produce proliferation of epithelial elements within the breast.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You will now look at the clinical findings. Usually a lump presents in the breast. Clinical evaluation begins with a complete history and physical examination. A biopsy is taken to confirm diagnosis. The extent (stage) is determined in order to avoid inappropriate measures like radical mastectomy in a patient with distant metastases.</p>
                        <p>The following steps should be taken during clinical evaluation:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Take a thorough medical history.</li>
                            <li>Take special note of menarche, pregnancies, last menstrual period, previous breast lesions and family history of breast cancer.</li>
                            <li>Presenting complaints in which you will find that 80% of cases will have a painless lump, and in 90% of cases, the lump will have been discovered by the patient herself.</li>
                            <li>Breast examination (see unit one of this module) should be meticulous, methodical and gentle. Examine the breast size and contour, minimal nipple retraction, slight oedema, redness and retraction of skin.</li>
                            <li>Breast cancer usually consists of a non-tender firm or hard lump with poorly delimited margins.</li>
                            <li>Slight nipple or skin retraction is an important sign.</li>
                            <li>Very small erosion (one to two millimetres) of the nipple epithelium may be the only manifestation of cancer.</li>
                            <li>Watery, serous or bloody discharge from the nipple is an occasional early sign.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>Before treatment is commenced, a definite diagnosis has to be made through laboratory tests, which will include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Blood test for sedimentation rate (which will be raised as a result of a disseminated cancer), alkaline phosphates (when raised is associated with liver metastases) and hypercalcaemia (occasionally an important finding in advanced malignancy of the breast) as well as a complete blood count.</li>

                            <p>An x-ray should be taken to determine the frequency of metastases to the lungs. A CT scan will help to locate metastases to the bones, brain, etc.</p>
                            <p>A biopsy should be performed where tissue is removed from the lesion and examined.</p>
                            <p>A cytology examination of nipple discharge or cyst or the breast is also recommended as well as a mammogram, which is a soft tissue radiological examination of the breast.</p>

                                <p>Treatment should never be undertaken without an unequivocal histological diagnosis of cancer. The safest course is to take biopsy of all suspicious masses found on physical examination.</p>

                            <p>The treatment may be curative or palliative according to clinical stage I, II, III disease. Palliative treatment by radiation, hormones, chemotherapy or a combination of methods is recommended for patients in stage IV of the disease (distant metastases) and for previously treated patients who have developed distant metastases or ineradicable local recurrences.</p>

                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Radical Mastectomy</h4>
                            <p>This involves en bloc removal of the breast, pectoral muscles and axillary nodes. It has been a standard curative procedure for breast cancer since the turn of the last century.</p>
                            <div class="remember-block">
                                <strong>Remember:</strong>
                                <p>This operation is contra-indicated in cancer that has spread to sub-clavicular nodes or to more distant sites because it will not cure the condition.</p>
                            </div>

                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Extended Radical Mastectomy</h4>
                            <p>This involves the removal of the internal mammary nodes in addition to standard radical mastectomy.</p>

                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Modified Radical Mastectomy</h4>
                            <p>This involves en bloc removal of the breast and preservation of the pectoralis major muscles. The advantages of this operation are that it is cosmetic and functional in that the preservation of the pectoralis major muscles avoids a hollow beneath the clavicle hence preventing shoulder dysfunction and oedema of the arm.</p>

                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Simple Mastectomy</h4>
                            <p>This is done if the malignancy is confined to the breast without spread to adjacent muscles or to the regional nodes or beyond.</p>

                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Local Excision/Lumpectomy</h4>
                            <p>This is also known as a partial mastectomy and provides definitive treatment for early breast cancer, especially for a small Stage I lesion.</p>

                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Radiotherapy</h4>
                            <p>This method is used for the treatment of certain breast cancers, particularly those that are locally advanced or in cases where the patient refuses a mastectomy.</p>
                            <p>The procedure can be used in conjunction with radical mastectomy as a pre-operative or postoperative course of action in order to reduce the incidence of local recurrence from residual cancer in the operative field. The process destroys metastatic cancer in the internal mammary and sub-clavicular lymph nodes. Therefore, the patient should be selected for radiotherapy based on the likelihood of local recurrence of the existence of disease in unresected regional nodes.</p>

                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Chemotherapy</h4>
                            <p>This process can be used in conjunction with radical mastectomy, especially in patients found to have positive axillary nodes.</p>
                            <p>Mortality and morbidity rates following radical mastectomy are low and the procedure is generally well tolerated even by elderly patients. However, you should note that there are several complications associated with breast cancer.</p>
                            <p>There are occasionally wound complications like haematoma or serum collection under the skin flaps and necrosis of the skin margins may occur but this can be easily managed. The most serious complications may include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Local recurrences of cancer within operative field. This signals the presence of a spread.</li>
                                <li>Oedema of the arm. When this appears in the early post-operative period, it is usually caused by lymphatic obstruction. Infection in the axilla may also be a cause of the oedema. This is because the lymphatic drainage of the arm is compromised and the extremity becomes more than normally susceptible to infection following minor injuries.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Chronic oedema should be managed by elevation and by a snugly fitted elastic sleeve, which is slipped over the arm from hand to shoulder. The patient should receive pre and post-operative nursing care in the same way as other surgical patients.</p>
                            <p>This patient will need long-term care. A periodic re-examination is done to detect recurrences and to observe the opposite breast for second carcinoma. The examination is conducted every six months until a period of five years postoperatively has elapsed. It is then carried out every six to twelve months thereafter for life.</p>
                            <p>The patient should also be advised on the importance of self-breast examination monthly, especially after menstruation. A mammogram should be obtained annually.</p>
                            <p>In order to facilitate rehabilitation after breast reconstruction, the patient should be advised on the active exercise of the shoulder and arm on the affected side, which should begin early in the post-operative period. The patient should have been counselled before surgery to enable her to adjust to the cosmetic defect. Before leaving the hospital, she should receive information on where to obtain prosthesis to wear in her brassiere.</p>
                            <p>The patient should also be informed that, theoretically, high levels of oestrogen produced by the placenta as the pregnancy progresses can be detrimental to the patient with occult metastases of oestrogen sensitive breast cancer.</p>

                            <p>For cancer confined to the breast the five year clinical cure rate by radical mastectomy is 75 to 90%.

                            <p>If skin retraction is present, the diagnosis of cancer should be assumed until it is disproved by biopsy.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Before any treatment is commenced, a biopsy should be done to check for any suspicious lesion. For small, localised cysts, an excision should be carried out after cancer has been ruled out.</p>
                        <p>If the diagnosis is certain from a previous biopsy, then aspiration of a discrete mass is done. If a cyst is present, typicaly watery fluid, which may be straw-coloured, grey, greenish, brown or black, can be easily evacuated and the mass disappears. A cytology examination of the fluid is indicated.</p>
                        <p>The patient should be re-examined at intervals of two to four weeks for three months and every six to twelve months thereafter for life.</p>
                        <p>Breast pain, associated with generalised mammary dyspalsia, is best treated by avoidance of trauma and by wearing a brassiere (day and night), which gives good support and protection.</p>

                            <p>You may find that symptoms of pain, tenderness and cyst formation will occur at any time until menopause, when they subside. The risk of breast cancer is usually about twice that of a woman in the general population. Therefore, the woman should be advised to:</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This is a common benign neoplasm occurring in young women usually within twenty years after puberty. It frequently tends to occur at an earlier age in black women than in white women. Multiple tumours in one or both breasts are found in 10 to 15% of patients.</p>
                        <p>The typical fibroadenoma is a round, firm, discrete, relatively movable, non-tender mass of one to five centimetres in diameter. The tumour is usually discovered accidentally. Clinical diagnosis in young patients is generally not difficult. For women over 30 years of age, cancer of the breast must be considered.</p>
                        <p>A fibroadenoma does not usually occur after the menopause but post-menopause women may develop it after the administration of oestrogenic hormone.</p>
                        <p>The treatment here is excision and pathologic examination to rule out any cancerous lesions.</p>
                        <p>Lastly you may remember when looking at abortion, two conditions had been left until the end of this unit. These were hydatid form mole and chorion carcinoma.</p>

                    <h3 id="s6-heading-hydatidiform-mole" class="subsection-heading">Hydatid Form Mole</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This is also referred to as molar pregnancy. It is an abnormal pregnancy resulting from a pathologic ovum with proliferation of the epithelial covering of the chorionic villi and dissolution and cysts cavitation of the vascular stroma of the villi. It results in a mass of cysts resembling a bunch of grapes.</p>
                        <p>Hydatid form change in placenta is a form of trophoblastic neoplasia, which may lead to frankly malignant proliferation of trophoblast cell known as choriocarcinoma. Histologically, to the naked eye, the mole may look like a bunch of whitish grapes, often interspersed with a blood clot (see the illustration opposite). <!-- No illustration was provided for this in MMD --> </p>
                        <p>The hydatid form mole can be classified into two:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Complete Mole, which shows total hydatid form change with no evidence of foetal circulation. They are more likely to develop malignant change.</li>
                            <li>Partial mole, which is associated with foetus (even if the only evidence is traces of a microscopic foetal circulation). They are less likely to develop malignant change.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Now move on to look at the aetiological factors of this condition.</p>
                        <p>Some of the aetiological factors associated with hydatid mole include maternal age and high parity and malnutrition.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Maternal Age</h4>
                        <p>It is common in women under the age of 20 years and over 45 years in whom congenital abnormalities are most likely to be found.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">High Parity and Malnutrition</h4>
                        <p>Although there is no evidence, these factors are associated in every society with congenital abnormalities.</p>
                        <p>Before they are enumerated it is important to mention that this condition is often not suspected because it is uncommon. Therefore, you should remember to rule it out in cases of threatened abortion and hyperemesis gravidarum. Did you think of the following clinical features?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bleeding is common, with a minor degree of intravascular coagulation. This is sometimes accompanied by a watery discharge and occasionally contains vesicles.</li>
                            <li>Hyperemesis, which is probably due to an increase in HCG secretion, although this is not the cause in hyperemesis in normal pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>Pallor and dyspnoea due to anaemia, which is often greater than expected.</li>
                            <li>Anxiety and tremors because of HCG, which is glycoprotein similar to TSH, and has weak thyroid stimulating properties.</li>
                            <li>High levels of HCG after 12 weeks of gestation.</li>
                            <li>Amenorrhoea and pregnancy test is positive.</li>
                            <li>Uterine enlargement where, in most cases, the uterus is larger than expected at 14 weeks of gestation. The uterine size may be normal after detachment of the mole.</li>
                            <li>Absent foetal heart. Very rarely a mole and a foetus will co-exist.</li>
                            <li>Absent foetal parts on palpation.</li>
                            <li>The uterus has a 'doughy' feel.</li>
                            <li>Signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia at 16 weeks are strongly suggestive of a mole (see unit two).</li>
                            <li>Proteinuria.</li>
                            <li>Vesicles passed per vagina.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>Evacuation is not without risks. Before evacuation, the main risks are the possibility of haemorrhage. There is also the risk of trophoblastic invasion and perforation of the myometrium and/or dissemination of possibly malignant cells.</p>
                            <p>During evacuation, the main risks include haemorrhage, perforation by instrument and dissemination of possibly malignant cells.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, in order to ensure the immediate safety of the patient, the following measures may be included in the management. The uterus should be completely emptied by suction after spontaneous abortion. Additionally, an attempt should be made to empty the uterus by suction if spontaneous abortion does not occur. This is usually feasible up to about 14 weeks.</p>
                            <div class="remember-block">
                                <strong>Remember:</strong>
                                <p>Oxytocin must be given if bleeding becomes severe. On rare occasions, an emergency hysterectomy may be unavoidable.</p>

                            <p>If the mother has passed the 16-week mark, abortion should be induced using prostaglandin and oxytocin.</p>
                            <p>Rapid evacuation of a large uterus has been known to cause disseminated intravascular coagulation and fatal shock. You should give blood transfusions to treat anaemia. Take a serial pregnancy test and chest x-rays.</p>
                            <p>In the case of an older woman, who does not wish to have any more children, a complete hysterectomy is justified, especially for the sake of clamping the uterine vessels to prevent the dissemination of trophoblast cells.</p>
                            <p>When following up, you should ensure the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Family planning methods should be used for one year to prevent immediate pregnancy.</li>
                                <li>A pregnancy test should be carried out every month for one year if titres are low and negative. After this, the patient is clear. However, if titres are increased, then suspect choriocarcinoma.</li>
                                <li>Chemotherapy is indicated when there is high HCG in serum after six months or detectable HCG in serum after six months.</li>
                                <li>Chest x-rays should be taken monthly until titres are negative and then every two months for one year.</li>

                        <p><dfn id="choriocarcinoma">Choriocarcinoma</dfn> is cancer of the placenta and it is very common in East Asia. 50% of cases will occur after a hydatid form mole, 25% after abortion, and 25% at interval (pregnancy). The prognosis is very poor as it does not often respond to treatment and many patients will die.</p>
                        <p>Signs and symptoms are similar to those associated with hydatid form mole, however, metastatic lesions are also present.</p>
                        <p>Once diagnosed, chemotherapy is immediately indicated.</p>

                        <ul>

                        <p>The choice of drug depends on the patient. After chemotherapy, the patient is advised to delay conception for a year to give time to the damaged ova to be shed.
