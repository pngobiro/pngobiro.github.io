\section*{Welcome to Unit Five: Gynaecology}

Gynaecology refers to diseases or conditions peculiar to women's reproductive systems. Patients with gynaecological disorders require a lot of understanding because of the emotional and the physical considerations that govern the situation. You should always respect the confidentiality of the patient's problems and share any information obtained only with those directly involved professionally with the care of the patient. This unit is composed of six sections:

\section*{Section 1: Gynaecological Investigations}

Section 2: Menstrual Disorders
Section 3: Bleeding Disorders in Early Pregnancy
Section 4: Genital Disorders including Injuries
Section 5: Infertility and Climacteric Crisis
Section 6: Neoplastic Disorders including Neoplasms of the Breast

\section*{Unit Objectives}

By the end of this unit you will be able to:
- Explain gynaecological investigations for patients with reproductive disorders
- Describe menstrual disorders and provide appropriate care
- Describe bleeding disorders in early pregnancy and take appropriate action
- Describe the appropriate management of genital disorders and injuries
- Describe the management of infertility and climacteric crisis
- Describe neoplastic conditions and take appropriate action

\section*{Section 1: Gynaecological Investigations}

\section*{Introduction}

Just like any other aspect of medicine, gynaecology and obstetrics require some investigative work. As a health worker, you must find clues in the patient's history and physical examination to help you make the right diagnosis. The more thorough the history and physical examination, the better the chances of making an accurate diagnosis.

You may also need to carry out certain tests and investigations in order to come to the correct conclusion. However, in order to take a complete history and conduct a thorough investigation, you need to know what in particular you are looking for.

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Describe history taking
- List various tests and gynaecological radiographic diagnostic procedures

\section*{Gynaecological History}

History taking should place an emphasis on the gynaecological history of the patient. This does not mean that other histories should be ignored. For the sake of minimising repetition, you will not go through the whole process. When taking a gynaecological history, you should enquire into the following:
Menstruation

Menstruation, including the age at which she had her first menstrual period, that is, menarche equivalent to ' K ', the length of the menstrual cycle, duration of the periods and the amount of blood loss and regularity as well as the date of the Last Normal Menstrual Period (LNMP).

Always record this information as 'K 13 5/28 regular'. This means that the periods began at the age of 13, last for five days and occur every 28 days.

\section*{Gynaecological Operations}

Take the history of any gynaecological operations, including the dates of operations. Possible gynaecological operations include dilatation and curettage, evacuation, laparotomy and hysterectomy and post-operative outcomes.

\section*{Contraceptive History}

Take the patient's contraceptive history, especially on surgical contraceptions, including the type of contraceptive, duration of use, side effects and when she stopped using it.

\section*{Sexual Behaviour}

Ask about the patient's sexual behaviour, noting that questions should be non-judgemental and you should not embarrass the patient. You should find out whether she is sexually active, whether the relationship is satisfactory and, if not, why. For example, find out if she has painful or difficult sex referred to as dyspareunia. In case of infertility find out also whether intercourse is normal, frequent and what time in the cycle. You need to ask if there is any post-coital bleeding or not. This information may well help you to detect any sexually transmitted diseases.

\section*{Lifestyle Habits}

Ask if she smokes or takes alcohol.

\section*{Summary}

You should make a summary of the history you have taken by picking out the important positive and negative information obtained. This will guide you when performing a physical examination.

\section*{Physical Examination}

A physical examination should be made up of a general, abdominal and vaginal examination. Abdominal and vaginal examinations were covered in module one, unit two, section three, so for now you will only look at general examination in detail.

\section*{General Examination}

A general examination provides more information about a patient and also gives the clinician a chance to establish a rapport with the patient. General examination usually includes a check on the vital signs and the general condition of the patient. When you are doing a general examination, you should look for the development of secondary sexual characteristics, including breast development (palpate for masses) and body hair distribution, especially the pubic hair. Hair on the chest and chin in a female will mean that she has more androgens.

\section*{Remember:}

Antiseptic is not used in this procedure because a specimen may be taken. If antiseptic is used to clean the vulva, it will destroy organisms hence leading to a false result.

\section*{Gynaecological Tests (1 of 9)}

As mentioned earlier, there are a number of laboratory tests and radiological investigations that you can carry out, in order to reach a definitive diagnosis. Urine

Urinalysis should be carried out to check the appearance of the urine, including colour and foam, chemical content such as protein and glucose, and micro-organisms such as bacteria and parasites.

A pregnancy test, if indicated, may be performed.

\section*{Blood}

Blood should be tested for haemoglobin levels (Hb) or full haemogram, Widal test and brucellosis test and also for VDRL (syphilis).

\section*{Vagina and Cervix}

Urethral smears and pus swabs should be taken to test for neisseria gonorrhoea. Take a high vaginal swabs test for candida albicans, trichomonas vaginalis, and neisseria gonorrhoea. You should also perform a cytological test for cancer as well as a cervical biopsy for further histological assessment, which will be covered later in this unit.

\section*{Cytological Test/Papanicolao Test (Pap Smear)}

This is a test that should be carried out on women of reproductive age once every year. Cancer of the cervix is one of the leading causes of mortality among women worldwide.

This test reveals the cancer in its early stages when it can be managed effectively.

\section*{Cervical Biopsy}

This test can also detect problems on the cervix. It may be done as an office procedure without anaesthesia, whereby the lesion is visualised by a colposcope and one or more punch biopsies. A colposcopy is a binocular inspection of the cervix with a magnification of up to 20 times.

The patient is advised to rest for 24 hours after a biopsy and to leave the packing or tampon in place for the recommended time, usually 8 to 24 hours. Vital signs should be frequently checked and any excess bleeding reported. Sexual intercourse should be delayed until the physician indicates that it is permissible.

\section*{Endoscopic Examination}

This examination involves entering the body organs by use of a scope. A scope is a special tubular instrument with a light attached to the end. When introduced into the hollow organs of the body they can be seen and studied. There are various types of endoscopic examinations.

The pelvic endoscopy/culdoscopy involves the use of a culdoscope, which is a tubular, lighted instrument similar to a cystoscope or laparoscope. An incision is made in the posterior vaginal cul-de-sac (fornix) to admit the instrument. It is commonly used to detect any pelvic masses. The patient is prepared as for vaginal operation and may be under local anaesthesia. The procedure is conducted in the operating room, with the patient in a knee-chest position.

\section*{Laparoscopy}

Indications are similar to that of a culdoscopy. However, with laproscopy, it is also possible to perform minor operative procedures like tubal ligation, ovarian biopsy and lysis of peritubal adhesion.

During this examination, a scope (of about 10 mm diameter) is inserted into the peritoneal cavity through a two centimetre sub-umbilical incision to allow visualisation of the pelvic structure. Dilatation and curettage follows, to
position a surgical instrument, which permits manipulation of the uterus during the laparoscopy, thus affording better visualisation.

The coldlight endoscope is passed through the cannula and the inspection made. An assistant or the operator himself can move the uterus about by means of the forceps on the cervix and a dilator or Spackman's cannula in the uterus. A camera attached to the eyepiece of the laparoscope permits assistants and observers to share the surgeon's view on a video screen and permits video recording of the findings or procedure.

Drapes are used during this procedure, but have been omitted in the illustration to allow unobstructed view.

Special biopsy forceps can be passed through another cannula and used to lift up any tissue that may be obstructing the view or to take ovarian biopsies. Some adhesions may be divided using laparoscopy scissors. Many procedures are now performed entirely or assisted by laparoscopy.

A better view of the pelvis, lower abdomen and visceral contents is also facilitated by injection of a prescribed amount of $\mathrm{CO}^{2}$ intraperitoneally into the cavity (insufflation). This separates the intestine from the pelvic organs.

The procedure is performed under general anaesthesia, meaning patients have to be prepared preoperatively. The patient is carefully observed for several hours to detect any complications, for example, bleeding or burns from the coagulator. The observation includes monitoring vital signs and signs of per vaginal bleeding. Reassure the patient and discharge when the vital signs become stable.

Next, move on to look at another procedure, which involves entering into the uterine cavity.

\section*{Hysteroscopy}

This procedure is indicated as a diagnostic measure only in complex situations, for example, infertility, unexplained bleeding and retained Intrauterine Device (IUD).

The hysteroscope is used to visualise all the parts of the uterine cavity. This procedure is best performed about five days after completion of menstruation (estrogenic phase of the menstrual cycle). This is because the fresh/new cells lining the uterine cavity can be studied properly in order to give accurate findings.

\section*{Remember:}

Hysteroscopy is contraindicated in patients with cervical or endometrial carcinoma due to dissemination of cancer cells.

Next move on to look at radiographic diagnostic procedures. It is important for you to know them so that you can provide appropriate care and advice to the patient undergoing these tests. Many radiological procedures, for example, x-ray films, barium enemas and intravenous urography, are helpful in the diagnosis of pelvic conditions. A few of the procedures specifically related to the diagnosis of gynaecological disorders will be covered here.

\section*{Hysterosalpingogram (Uterotubogram)}

This is an x-ray study of the uterus and uterine tubes after injection of a contrast medium. This is done to study sterility problems, tubal patency and/or the presence of pathological conditions in the uterine cavity.

A patient undergoing this examination should have her intestines evacuated by enema. 'Starve' the patient for at least four to six hours. Give analgesic for comfort since some patients may experience nausea, vomiting, cramps and faintness. Briefly explain the procedure to the patient and give reassurance. Observe the vital signs.

The patient may feel some discomfort after the procedure. You should continue observing her vital signs and if the patient is not nauseated, give her food as soon as she can tolerate it. You should also provide plenty of fluids to flush the urinary system. Computerised Tomography (CT Scanning)

A CT scan can reveal the presence of cancer and its extension into the retroperitoneal lymph nodes and skeletal involvement.

The CT scan has several advantages over an ultrasound and it is more effective, especially with obese patients and/or patients with a distended bowel or stomach. This is because it penetrates deep into the organ targeted and reveals more information about these organs. In preparation, the patient should be 'starved' before this procedure.

The scanner takes repeated x-ray pictures of a cross-section of the body (nearly 300 pictures within five seconds) as the x -ray tube is rotated around the patient.

Some absorption of x-rays takes place according to the density of the tissues through which the x-rays pass. Thus the difference between the amount of radiation entering the body and amount measured by the detectors is equivalent to the density of the tissues.

\section*{Ultrasound}

This is commonly used and does not require any special preparation of the patient, except to ensure that they have a full bladder. This is because a distended bladder usually pushes the uterus out of the pelvic cavity allowing it to be properly viewed. It is used to diagnose pelvic tumours and other abnormalities.

\section*{Section 2: Menstrual Disorders}

\section*{Introduction}

In this section you are going to focus on menstrual disorders. Menstruation is a normal body event in every woman, even though for some it may be an uncomfortable experience. On a light note, however, there is an old adage that says 'the menstrual flow is the tears of a disappointed uterus'.

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Describe factors that influence menstruation
- Describe the various menstrual disorders and their management

\section*{Factors Influencing Normal Menstruation}

The events occurring in the following organs influence the mechanism of normal menstruation:
- The hypothalamus influences the anterior pituitary gland to produce follicle stimulating hormone.
- The anterior pituitary gland produces follicle stimulating hormone, which matures the Graafian follicle under the influence of the hypothalamus. It also produces the luteinising hormone, which influences the development of corpus luteum to produce oestrogen or progesterone.
- The ovaries develop the Graafian follicle.
- The uterine endometrium thickens under the influence of oestrogen and progesterone, in preparation to receive the ovum.

\section*{Menstrual Disorders (1 of 34)}

\section*{Amenorrhoea}

Amenorrhoea is a symptom, not a disease. It is derived from the Greek word amenrein, which translates as follows:
- A... without
- Men... month
- Rein... to flow

It can, therefore, be interpreted to mean 'without monthly flow', thus amenorrhoea means 'absence or cessation of menstruation'. The absence of menstrual periods can be physiologically normal.

Move on to find out at which point amenorrhoea is considered to be normal.

\section*{Name at least three periods in a woman's life when amenorrhoea is considered normal.}

Your answer should include the following:
- Before puberty, when the hormones concerned have not started functioning.
- During pregnancy, when the hormones concerned are diverted to the growth of the fertilised ovum.
- During lactation (after delivery), which results in lactation amenorrhoea due to the presence of prolactin.
- At menopause, when the hormones diminish and cease to be produced.

You have focused on pathological amenorrhoea, which can be divided into two, namely primary and secondary amenorrhoea.

\section*{Primary Amenorrhoea}

Primary amenorrhoea means that menstruation has never occurred. This is seen in a young woman who is over 17 years of age and who has not yet begun to menstruate but exhibits signs of sexual maturation. Pathological primary amenorrhoea is when the patient has never menstruated and has not developed secondary sexual characteristics.

\section*{Primary Amenorrhoea}

There are two main factors that lead to primary amenorrhoea. These are hormonal factors and developmental anomalies.

\section*{Hormonal Factors}

This is due to the malfunctioning of the pituitary gland. As a result, the hormones responsible for sex maturation are affected, which in turn affects the beginning of menstruation.

In Cushing's syndrome, the excessive production of cortisols may hinder menstruation from starting.

\section*{Developmental Anomalies}

During the development of the foetus, the vagina, uterus or ovaries may fail to develop. The congenital abnormality in the vagina that causes primary amenorrhoea is an imperforate hymen. In this case, the girl experiences all the feelings and discomforts of menstrual flow. There is actually menstruation and the blood accumulates behind the hymen, (in the vagina), but does not come out. This condition is known as cryptomenorrhoea and when not treated, the uterus distends, leading to what is known as haematometra. The girl may present with abdominal pain and the absence of menstruation. The condition can be cured by an incision of the hymen to allow the blood to flow out freely. After the incision you should advise the girl to maintain high standards of hygiene. The vulva should be cleaned three times a day until healed.

Other causes include male pseudohermaphroditism (a male develops as a female) and Turner's syndrome where one has only one x-chromosome.
Now move on to look at secondary amenorrhoea.

\section*{Secondary Amenorrhoea}

Secondary amenorrhoea simply means that the periods, which were once present, have stopped.
There are some women who have a longer cycle of up to two to three months and this is considered normal as long as it is regular. However, secondary amenorrhoea occurs after a normal menarche, which then ceases for more than six months. Six months is a considerable duration for it to be abnormal.

Now move on to look at some of the possible causes of secondary amenorrhoea.

\section*{Hormonal Disturbances}

Hormonal disturbances in the pituitary gland can lead to hypopituitarism, especially after severe postpartum haemorrhage and collapse. This leads to pituitary cachexia/Sheehan's disease. In this condition, there is temporary deprivation of blood supply to the pituitary, leading to ischaemia. This impairs the functions of the pituitary gland.

In addition, disturbances in the adrenal gland, thyroid gland and/or ovaries can affect the influence of the hypothalamus on the pituitary gland.

\section*{Debilitating Systemic Disorders}

Chronic diseases that cause general ill health, for example, genital tuberculosis, or severe anaemia may lead to secondary amenorrhoea.

\section*{Nervous Disorders}

Any stress can act on the hypothalamus to inhibit follicle stimulating hormone/leutinising hormone-releasing hormone.
This may lead to stress or hypothalamic amenorrhoea. Minor emotional upsets related to being away from home, attending college, tension from schoolwork or interpersonal problems are the most common causes of secondary amenorrhoea, especially
in adolescents.
Other related disorders that cause stress include longstanding psychiatric disorders, especially depression or anxiety and stress due to exercise, which leads to exercise amenorrhoea. This is especially common in marathon runners.

Others include brain tumours which may destroy the hypothalamus.

\section*{Drugs}

Contraceptives may lead to post contraceptive amenorrhoea and in some individuals it may take three to six months before the return of menstruation. This is because the ovulation had been suppressed and therefore had an effect on the hormones concerned.

Phenothiazines, especially in large doses, may lead to amenorrhoea due to prolactinaemia and certain hypotensive agents have also been implicated. You may remember (as mentioned in lactation amenorrhoea) that these drugs stimulate prolactin.

\section*{Dietary Amenorrhoea}

Loss of weight due to prolonged fasting will affect the hypothalamic function in ways which are not yet understood. Nutritional deficiency will also affect menstruation.

\section*{Ovarian Cysts}

Ovarian cysts, especially follicular and corpus luteum cysts, cause amenorrhoea, however these tend to regress with time and menstruation resumes.

\section*{Oligomenorrhoea}

Finally, this is a type of amenorrhoea where there is infrequent menstruation, which may occur months before menopause and, at times, due to emotional upset.

A woman with this problem should be investigated thoroughly to exclude other serious conditions, for example, neoplasms. You should reassure the patient if the cause of the condition is emotional.

\section*{Management of Amenorrhoea}

After discussing both types of amenorrhoea, you will now look at their management.
First, establish the cause of the condition. In each case you must take a detailed history and then carry out a clinical examination to rule out pregnancy.

You should also consider the general health of the woman, including psychological and environmental factors. In the case of a young girl who appears normal on examination, it is better to wait until she is 18 years old but in the meantime reassure her and give her health education on sexuality.

\section*{Remember:}

The most common cause of secondary amenorrhoea is almost always pregnancy, therefore, an obstetric and gynaecological history is important to making a diagnosis.

A series of investigations can be performed and these should include the following steps:

\section*{History Taking}

This is very important as it helps you make a distinction between primary and secondary amenorrhoea and, therefore, institute appropriate management measures.

Some women have very infrequent and scanty bleeding, which is virtually primary amenorrhoea. If the patient is experiencing the physical disturbances of menstruation without actually bleeding, a cyclical change in the hormone level can be assumed and the cause of amenorrhoea is likely to be in the genital tract.

\section*{Pelvic Examination}

It is essential to exclude pregnancy or uterine hypoplasia (in virgins this is usually done under general anaesthesia).

A bi-manual examination can reveal gross abnormalities such as cryptomenorroea.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_04_e48433557d58b46bddecg-13.jpg?height=492&width=740&top_left_y=318&top_left_x=248)

Remember to inspect the secondary sexual characteristics during pelvic examination.

\section*{Radiological Examination}

You should take an x-ray of the chest and a straight skull x-ray to detect enlargement of the sella turcica (pituitary fossa).

You will remember the pituitary gland plays a great role and chronic diseases like TB can affect menstruation.

\section*{Endocrine Tests}

To find out the hormonal factors, the following should be carried out:
- Collection of urine samples for over 24 hours to measure levels of different hormones.
- Estimation of blood hormone levels. The hormones investigated are follicle stimulating, leutinising and prolactin. If there is hyper-prolactinaemia, then refer the patient to an endocrinologist for pituitary tumour investigation and management.

\section*{Laparoscopy}

This is done to detect any developmental anomalies.
An ovarian biopsy can also be carried out during this procedure.

\section*{Dilatation and Curettage}

This is commonly performed, especially in countries where tuberculosis is common. The presence of the acid-fast bacilli in the endometrial cells or any other organisms may be the cause of amenorrhoea.

\section*{Others}

More recent technologies include the ultrasound or CT scan which detect various abnormalities. It can reveal the presence of tumours in the ovaries or the adrenal gland.

\section*{Management of Amenorrhoea - Medical Treatment}

The medical treatment will depend on the cause of the amenorrhoea.

\section*{Clomiphene Citrate (Clomid)}

If ovulation is the problem, then it can be induced using clomiphene citrate. This drug should be restricted to those individuals desiring pregnancy because it acts on the Graafian follicle. It can also be used in adolescents with recurrent ovulatory bleeding in an attempt to establish regular ovulatory cycles.

The dosage initially given is 50 mg daily for five days and ovulation is expected to occur five to eleven days following discontinuation. If there is no response, the dose is gradually increased up to 200 mg .

Side effects of clomid include:
- Hyper-stimulation leading to enlargement of the ovaries.
- Multiple gestation because more than one ovum may mature.
- Abortion is common with patients treated for infertility.
- Teratology, that is, the increased incidence of congenital anomalies, if conception takes place while the woman is still taking the drug.
- Bloating, nausea and vomiting.

\section*{Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin (HMG) and Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (HCG) Pergonal}

This is a preparation of leutinising hormone and follicle stimulating hormone extracted from human menopausal urine and is available in ratio of 1:1.

The therapy is indicated when there is failure to ovulate even after clomid administration for six to twelve months. The dosage is HMG 375 units daily, increasing progressively up to 1500 units daily.

\section*{Remember:}

\section*{Hormonal monitoring during this therapy is important in order to keep the hormones in balance.}

\section*{Bromocriptine}

This is effective as an ovulatory agent in most patients with hyperprolactinaemia from an anaplastic source.

It acts by suppressing the central and peripheral concentrations of prolactin, so that its level stimulates the production of oestrogen and progesterone. The dosage initially is 2.5 mg up to four weeks.

\section*{Other Agents}

Other agents used for the induction of ovulation include glucocorticosteriods (dexamethosone 0.5 mg nocte, prednisone 0.75 mg ) and oestradiol (estrogen).

Do not forget that emotional disturbance is one of the features that cause amenorrhoea. Such patients will require psychotherapy to relieve the tension/stress. Through history taking, you may be able to get clues to any emotional stress and try to allay the patient's anxiety.

\section*{Surgical Management}

Pituitary tumours may require excision.
Now move on to look at the other group of menstrual disorders.

\section*{Dysmenorrhoea}

Dysmenorrhoea means painful menstruation. Some women experience pain and discomfort during menstruation and many will learn to live with it. However, in some women the pain is severe enough to make the woman seek treatment.

There are two types of dysmenorrhoea:
- Primary Dysmenorrhoea
(also known at Spasmodic Dysmenorrhoea)
- Secondary Dysmenorrhoea
(also known as Congestive Dysmenorrhoea)
Now move on to look at these in more detail.

\section*{Primary (or Spasmodic) Dysmenorrhoea}

You may have come across young girls seeking treatment due to abdominal pain during menstruation. This is a common complaint and usually starts soon after puberty, although the first few cycles may have been painless.

The pain starts at the beginning of the period and lasts from a few hours to two days. This pain is 'cramp-like' and is felt in the pelvic and lower back region, and may radiate into the legs. Severe pain is sometimes accompanied by nausea, vomiting and fainting. These reactions may encourage the woman to seek treatment.

The causes of this condition are not well known but several theories have been put forward. It may probably be caused by ischaemia due to prolonged contraction of the uterine muscle occurring in the first day of menstruation. The ischaemia means that oxygen to the uterine muscle is cut off accounting for the pain. In this case, it is said that childbirth may cure this condition since after the uterus has held the baby, it is more vascular and so not easily ischaemic.

It has also been posited that dysmenorrhoeic uteri are hypoplastic but there is no evidence. Endocrine abnormalities have occasionally been implicated, probably due to the imbalances. Prostaglandins from disintegrating endometrium may cause uterine spasms (that is why in cases of dysmenorrhoea the concentration of PGF2 in menstrual fluids is increased).

Psychological factors undoubtedly aggravate symptoms, for example, there may be fear of sexual or reproductive abnormalities, leading the uterus to spasm.

Cervical stenosis also seems to be a factor. It is believed that during pregnancy and delivery the stenosed cervix is dilated hence the reason the problem may disappear after delivery.

\section*{Management of Primary Dysmenorrhoea}

Unfortunately, a spontaneous cure does not occur soon enough for most women who suffer from primary dysmenorrhoea. Therefore, as part of your management, you should perform the following:
- Take history with special reference to the severity and duration of the pain.
- Perform a physical examination to exclude pelvic tumours.
- Give a full and frank discussion of the normal cycle as this is an important part of treatment.
- Share health messages on the importance of exercise and the avoidance of unnecessary restriction of general activities.
- Provide women suffering from dysmenorrhoea with sympathy and support. Administer a suitable drug which will alleviate the pain sufficiently to allow a normal existence during the period time. Fortunately, patients tend to improve or at least complain less as they grow older.

Drugs that can alleviate pain include any antipyretics and analgesics. These should be the most effective drugs to inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandin, that is, if the prostaglandin's theory is correct.

These include aspirin and paracetamol, which are widely used and usually prescribed as two tablets three times daily. Mefenamic acid (ponstan) 500 mg three times daily is also common. This drug is said to prevent the action of prostaglandin on muscles as well as inhibit its production. Other drugs include flufenamic acid (arlef) and indomethacin (indocid).

Many of these drugs are usually prescribed for the relief of rheumatic pain but have been used with success in dysmenorrhoea.

\section*{Remember:}

These drugs must be used carefully as they can adversely affect patients with other medical disorders, including asthma. Do not give strong analgesics like morphine, pethidine and other addictive drugs.

Another effective management method is the contraceptive pill. In a small number of girls, when simple measures fail, they can be put on the family planning pill which, by inhibiting ovulation, will result in painless periods. These few individuals should be placed on the pill for four to six months continuously, after which the problem may disappear completely. This is achieved with a high-progesterone, low-oestrogen combined pill, for example, minovular.

Surgery, in the form of pre-sacral neurectomy, may be offered as a last resort to a patient whose dysmenorrhoea cannot be relieved by any other means and is interfering with her daily life.

Now move on to look at secondary dysmenorrhoea.

\section*{Secondary (or Congestive) Dysmenorrhoea}

This type of dysmenorrhoea may be caused by some pathology in the pelvis. The patient usually complains of a dull aching pain in the lower abdomen. The pain commonly begins three to four days (or sometimes up to ten days) prior to menstruation, and ceases after the flow is established or may persist throughout the period.

Pain is often made worse by exercise.

\section*{Remember:}

Dysmenorrhoea, which starts after the age of 30 years should always be investigated since it could be due to some pathology in the reproductive system.

The causes of secondary dysmenorrhoea include:
- Chronic Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases (PID)
- Endometriosis
- Uterine fibroids
- Abnormal fibrous attachments (adhesions)
- Salpingitis

These conditions and their management will be covered later in this unit and also in the next unit (unit six). It is important to remember, however, that in this country the most common cause of secondary dysmenorrhoea is chronic PID and also with most women complaining of infertility.

Treatment of the cause will usually relieve the dysmenorrhoea, but as you know successful treatment of chronic PID is difficult and so prevention should be emphasised.

\section*{Management of Secondary Dysmenorrhoea}

Take a full history to find out the cause of the condition, so that the patient can receive treatment according to the cause.

There are other symptoms, which may cause dysmenorrhoea and these will be discussed in the next sub-section.

\section*{Pre Menstrual Tension Syndrome (PMT)}

This condition is due to a large group of symptoms, which appear regularly and predictably about 12 days before the onset of menstruation. This group of symptoms includes:
- Water retention leading to weight gain, painful breasts, abdominal distension and feeling of bloatedness.
- Pain in the form of backache, headache, tiredness and muscle stiffness.
- Autonomic reaction, for instance, dizziness/faintness, cold sweats, nausea and vomiting and hot flushes.
- Mood change, including tension, irritability, depression and crying spells.
- Loss of concentration, manifested as forgetfulness, clumsiness, difficulty in making decisions and insomnia (poor sleep).
- Miscellaneous symptoms, including feelings of suffocation, chest pains, heart pounding, numbness and tingling sensation.

Patients with the symptoms of PMT can be relieved by giving them diuretics, for example, chlorothiazide in the pre menstrual week. They can also benefit from oral contraceptives, for instance, progesterones like norethisterone 20 mg daily from the 15th to 25th day of the cycle.

Tranquillisers and psychotherapy also appear to be equally effective.
Patients should be told about the physiology that is producing these symptoms because they may think they have a terrible disease and the worries may increase the intensity of these symptoms.

Dietary management involves taking a low salt diet and avoiding alcohol and caffeine.
Exercise is also recommended to relieve the symptoms.

\section*{Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding (DUB)}

Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is diagnosed by exclusion of the conditions, which cause bleeding from the uterus. The conditions to be excluded include:
- Infection
- Ruptured ectopic pregnancy
- Trauma
- Uterine fibroids and polyps
- Genital cancers
- Hormonal treatment

Once you have excluded the conditions mentioned above, the cause of DUB is most likely to be hormonal imbalance, which is associated with involuntary periods. As there is very little you can do, you should refer all patients with abnormal uterine bleeding to the hospital for investigations and management.

\section*{Remember:}

If the patient is very sick due to excessive bleeding, then resuscitate and give intravenous fluids before referring.

In the hospital, teenage girls who have just started menstruating should be given a combination of oestrogen and progesterone. The contraceptive pill is a good option and treatment should be continued for three to six cycles. After treatment is stopped, menstruation often returns to normal.

For women in the reproductive age group, true dysfunctional bleeding is uncommon. The most likely cause of abnormal bleeding at this age is some complication of pregnancy. Diagnostic curettage is needed and you must remember the possibility of malignant disease.

In women over 40 years of age all the organic causes of bleeding, including malignant disease, may occur. Accurate diagnosis, including curettage is essential.

\section*{Menorrhagia}

Menorrhagia is a normal cycle with an excessive loss of blood (heavy menstrual flow). The normal average volume of menstrual loss is approximately 70 ml . Menstrual loss is naturally greater in parous women.

Menorrhagia is clinically an important condition because this excessive bleeding results in anaemia. It is not a disease but a symptom and to treat it one must find out what is causing it. The best way to manage this condition is to refer the patient to hospital where investigations will be carried out and managed appropriately.

The most common causes of menorrhagia include:
- Fibroids due to a larger endometrial cavity hence larger bleeding areas
- Chronic PID
- Endometrial polyps
- Abnormalities in the blood clotting power, for example, leukaemia, thrombocytopenic purpura
- Abnormal hormonal state, leading to excessively thick endometrium, which bleeds heavily when shed
- Emotional factors, which can sometimes cause heavy bleeding
- Intrauterine contraceptive devices

Some of these conditions will be discussed in a later part of this unit.

\section*{Management of Menorrhagia}

The management of this condition includes:
- History taking followed by pelvic examination.
- Investigations of blood for abnormalities and checking Hb , grouping and cross-matching.
- Dilatation and curettage under general anaesthetic. This procedure may be curative if there is not any other abnormality. The patient should be prepared preoperatively and postoperative care should be provided as for any other surgical procedure.
- Older women can be better treated by a hysterectomy.

\section*{Metrorrhagia}

This is menstrual bleeding lasting too long. It is caused by irregular shedding of the endometrium because the corpus luteum degenerates too slowly and the progesterone effect persists. Some secretory endometrium is still present early in the following cycle.

The causes of this disorder are:
- The possibility of cancer of the genital tract with this kind of bleeding.
- Uterine polyps projecting into the vagina may cause bleeding.
- Incomplete evacuation after abortion.
- Hydatid form mole.
- Chorion carcinoma.
- Occasionally women on oral contraceptives may have what is called 'break through bleeding'.

\section*{Management of Metrorrhagia}

The management will include:
- Taking a detailed history.
- Performing a digital examination and speculum to visualise the cervix and even take a Pap smear, therefore, the patient should be referred to the gynaecologist as soon as possible.

\section*{Remember:}

Never dismiss metrorrhagia lightly. A thorough examination should be performed. Epimenorrhoea

This is when normal menstruation occurs too often due to a shortened luteal phase by early degeneration of the corpus luteum.

\section*{Management of Epimenorrhoea}

The management of this condition will include:
- A detailed history to establish the cause.
- Refer all patients with abnormal bleeding to hospital for investigations and treatment.
- In the hospital teenage girls who have just started menstruating should be treated with a combination of oestrogen and progesterone contraceptive pill, which should be continued for three to six cycles.
- Meanwhile the patient should also be given iron to help replace any blood lost.
- In women of the reproductive age group, diagnostic curettage is needed. Remember the possibility of malignant diseases.
- Curettage may cure the condition, but if it does not, a hysterectomy may be the best option leaving the ovaries intact.

\section*{Hypomenorrhoea}

This is when the period occurs on a regular basis but is minimal. For example, there are rare cases whereby a woman menstruates regularly twice or thrice in a year. This is considered to be normal although you may be able to guess what problems this woman may have? This will be covered later in this unit.

\section*{Endometriosis or Adenomyosis}

This condition is as a result of the endometrial tissue being deposited in any organ of the body, for example, the ovary or uterosacral ligaments.

The ectopic tissue consists of both glands and stroma in which cyclical menstrual changes occur. Malignant changes are very rare. The process where the endometrial tissues invade the myometrium in the uterus is referred to as internal endometriosis or adenomyosis (the uterus is enlarged). There is no difference clinically between adenomyosis and fibroids on feeling the uterus, but they are different histologically.

Endometriosis occurs only in tis sues adjacent to the Mullerian systems (a pair of ducts in the female foetus which develop into reproductive system). The theories, which explain the occurrence of endometriosis include that it may be disseminated by means of the lymphatic and vascular system, which is why endometrial tissue may be found in the umbilicus, forearm and thigh.

\section*{Endometriosis or Adenomyosis}

Endometriosis is also strangely common in social groups where childbearing is delayed to the late twenties or early thirties. This might explain why it is rarely diagnosed before the age of 20 years and not apparent after menopause.

Physical signs will depend on the site of the disease and they include:
- 'Chocolate cysts' which are tender, fixed, bilateral masses, resembling chronic salpingoophritis but without any history of infection, fever or discharge.
- Uterine lesions may cause nodular or uniform uterine enlargement and may be clinically indistinguishable from fibromyomata or diffuse hyperplasia.
- Recto-vaginal lesions are tender, hard fixed and simulate rectal carcinoma.
- Local lesion, for example, in scars may be tender at menstrual periods.
- Dysmenorrhoea occurs and any palpable tumour may become painful at the time of the menstruation.
- Recto-vaginal lesions will cause dyspareunia.
- Menorrhagia and irregular bleeding occur from associated endometrial hyperplasia or from uterine lesions.
- Infertility occurs in $30 \%$ of patients with endometriosis and this is due to pelvic adhesions or endometrial abnormalities.

\section*{Management of Endometriosis}

The first step is to take a detailed history to elicit the symptoms of dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia and dyspareunia. There are rarely abnormal findings on abdominal examination.

Refer the patient to a gynaecologist. On vaginal examination, the uterus may be enlarged and tender (adenomyosis). Areas around the ovaries are tender and, characteristically, there is limited mobility of uterus. A cyst is sometimes palpable in either fornix.

Speculum examination may reveal typical areas of endometriosis in the cervix or vaginal vault. A laparotomy is indicated when cystic swelling is felt or if you are in doubt of the diagnosis.

If the patient is under 40 years of age, surgical treatment is usually designed to destroy areas of endometriosis using diathermy function. Hormonal therapy should include either progesterone steroids when confirmed, administered either cyclically or continuously for three to twelve months (this therapy suppresses the residual areas). Pregnancy is another way of suppressing the condition, and often has a curative effect on endometriosis.

Patients over 40 years of age may undergo a hysterectomy, which can include the removal of the affected ovary since hormonal therapy is not always helpful.

\section*{Section 3: Bleeding Disorders in Pregnancy}

\section*{Introduction}

In this section you will look at bleeding disorders in pregnancy. These conditions are usually on the borderline between obstetrics and gynaecology, in the sense that they involve women whose pregnancy comes to a premature end. You will find that these patients are always treated in a gynaecological ward rather than in the maternity ward.

For the purposes of this unit, bleeding in pregnancy refers to any bleeding per vagina. This bleeding, however slight, should be taken seriously. It is sometimes the first sign of some of the most life-threatening emergencies in obstetrics such as ruptured ectopic, and incomplete abortion. You will look at the possible causes of bleeding per vagina during pregnancy, how each case presents, and how it should be managed. The procedure known as Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA) as part of post-abortal care will also be covered.

It is important for you to note that bleeding per vagina during pregnancy is a cause for concern to most mothers. This is particularly so in a mother who has had a previous experience of vaginal bleeding which resulted in foetal loss. You must, therefore, be aware of the mother's emotional situation when caring for her during the antepartum period.

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of this section you will be able to:
- State the different types of abortion
- Specify the causes of abortions
- Describe the management of at least three types of abortion
- Describe signs and symptoms of ruptured ectopic
- Describe the management of ruptured ectopic

\section*{Bleeding in Early Pregnancy (1 of 30)}

Vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy refers to any bleeding per vagina that occurs before the 28th week of pregnancy. In the early months of pregnancy, bleeding may be due to a number of factors or conditions.

\section*{Name three conditions that cause bleeding in early pregnancy.}

Did you think of any of the following conditions?
- Abortion
- Ectopic pregnancy
- Hydatidiform mole
- Chorion carcinoma

As you may know, the most common cause of bleeding in early pregnancy is abortion. Abortion accounts for $95 \%$ of all bleeding in early pregnancy, whilst all the others account for only $5 \%$. The last two, that is hydatidiform mole and chorion carcinoma will be discussed in the last section of this unit.

\section*{Abortion}

Abortion is defined as the loss or expulsion of the foetus before the 20th week of pregnancy. Abortion is significant not only because of the loss of a wanted pregnancy, but because it is a major cause of maternal death from the haemorrhage and sepsis that may follow a mismanaged abortion.

The definition of abortion generally accepted for legal purposes is 'the delivery of a foetus at less than 20 weeks gestation or with foetal weight of less than 500 gm '.

Many people tend to look upon abortion as pregnancy that has been terminated criminally and miscarriage as a spontaneous occurrence. As a result, abortion is stigmatised, however, the two are the same thing.

\section*{Causes of Abortion}

The causes of abortion are many and are divided into maternal, foetal and miscellaneous causes.
Maternal causes of abortion account for about $25 \%$ of the known cases of abortions and they include the following:
- General diseases like hypertension or chronic heart disease.
- Acute febrile illnesses, for example, malaria, acute pyelonephritis, pneumonia.
- Endocrine disorders, for example, thyrotoxicosis, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.
- Local conditions such as under development of the uterus, fibroids and congenital abnormalities of the uterus. The fibroids can cause abortions, especially if they are submucous or deeply intramural. The congenital abnormalities of the uterus include a septate uterus and a bicornuate (uterus divided into two) uterus.
- Cervical incompetence which may be due to either congenital weakness of the circular muscle fibres of the cervix, or previous splitting of the cervical sphincter due to obstetrical trauma, or high amputation of the cervix due to cervical lesions.

Foetal causes of abortion account for about $75 \%$ of the known cases and they often result in early abortion, that is, first trimester abortions. Foetal causes may be due to:
- Chromosomal or genetic abnormalities.
- Abnormal attachment of the placenta, that is, defective implantation or activity of the trophoblast.

In addition to maternal and foetal causes, there are those that are grouped as miscellaneous causes. These include:
- Accidents, for example, falls, and injuries. The incidence of abortion among these cases varies enormously from individual to individual after the accidents.
- Criminal interference, using various instruments, local herbs and plastic catheters, which are inserted into the cervical canal.
- An Intrauterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD). An abortion, especially in the second trimester can occur if conception occurs despite the presence of an IUCD. Note that
ectopic pregnancy, antepartum haemorrhage, premature rupture of the membranes and manual removal of the placenta occurs more commonly in pregnancy with an IUCD. Therefore, the IUCD should be removed as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed.

Most of these abortions occur in the first three months of the pregnancy, before the placenta is mature. Abortion is the detachment of the products of conception, which is accompanied by bleeding that may be profuse. Blood loss is accompanied by painful contractions of the uterus, dilation of the cervix and expulsion of the foetus and its membranes. Slight or even moderate bleeding does not, however, mean that the foetus is no longer alive. As a health worker you must do all you can to save life at all times.

\section*{Types of Abortion}

As you can see there are many different types of abortion.
- Threatened Abortion
- Inevitable or Imminent Abortion
- Missed Abortion
- Habitual Abortion
- Septic Abortion
- Induced Abortion

Now move on to look at the different types of abortions and how they are managed.

\section*{Threatened Abortion}

The patient with threatened abortion will have slight vaginal bleeding and abdominal discomfort. When you examine her you will find the os of the cervix closed.

While many patients will successfully carry this type of pregnancy to term, others may not. It is essential, therefore, to make the patient realise that nothing can be done to prevent an abortion.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_04_e48433557d58b46bddecg-28.jpg?height=567&width=779&top_left_y=264&top_left_x=250)

\section*{Threatened Abortion}

Slight placental separation, slight bleeding, os closed.

\section*{Threatened Abortion}

Here are some essential measures to take:
- Reassure the patient that, if she continues with the pregnancy, the foetus will not be at greater risk of abnormalities and that it will continue to grow just like in a normal pregnancy.
- Ensure bed rest and allay anxiety (of losing the pregnancy) by administering tabs. Phenobarbitone 30 to 60 mgs tds, morphine 10 mgs or pethidine 100 mgs . If the pain is stronger, some doctors may use progesterone.
- Warn the patient to notify the medical team if the cramps become worse or the bleeding becomes heavy.
- Ask her to save the pads as well as any tissue or clots that she might expel, for examination.
- Advise her to take a low residue diet and avoid aperients and enema because this will stimulate the contractions.
- Advise her to remain in bed for at least three days after the bleeding stops.
- Advise her to avoid heavy physical activities and especially sexual excitement.

\section*{Remember:}

Vaginal examination is NOT usually carried out because of fear of increasing uterine disturbance.

\section*{Inevitable or Imminent Abortion}

Inevitable or imminent abortion means that nothing else can be done. The foetus must come out. The abortion becomes inevitable if, in addition to vaginal bleeding and abdominal discomfort, the uterine contractions become strong and painful and lead to dilatation of the cervix. This is followed by either complete abortion or incomplete abortion.

The primary measure taken is to save the life of the patient since there is often profuse bleeding, especially in patients who end up with an incomplete abortion. Take the patient's history to determine if the products of conception have been expelled.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_04_e48433557d58b46bddecg-29.jpg?height=546&width=773&top_left_y=1071&top_left_x=253)

Incomplete Abortion Placenta and membranes are retained. Foetus is expelled.

\section*{Inevitable or Imminent Abortion}

Many patients will come to the hospital due to severe bleeding, which means that the products of conception have been retained. Since there is essentially no chance of the pregnancy progressing any further under these circumstances, the uterus should be emptied immediately.

\section*{Remember:}

Resuscitate all patients with shock first, before transferring them to a hospital.
If the patient has excessive blood loss, hasten the evacuation by administering an oxytocic drug. Bleeding that does not cease after the expulsion of the products of conception will require administration of ergometrine 0.5 mg stat.

Take blood for grouping and cross-matching then fix a drip of plasma expanders or normal saline/Hartman's solution. Give a strong analgesic to relieve pain. Severe pain can lead to shock.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_04_e48433557d58b46bddecg-30.jpg?height=530&width=779&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=250)

Complete abortion Placenta, foetus and membranes are all expelled.

Save anything passed per vagina to inspect if all products of conception have been passed. Observe infection prevention principles while performing vaginal examinations to remove any placenta tissues distending the cervix.

A finger or sponge forceps is used to remove the products of conception. Observe bleeding and if the temperature is normal after the evacuation of contents, the patient can be discharged.

\section*{Missed Abortion}

This means that the products of conception are not expelled despite the signs and symptoms of abortion. It occurs when abortion is threatened but the bleeding ceases and all is apparently well, except that signs of pregnancy subside, breast activity stops, and the uterus does not grow bigger.

After some time (about eight weeks) a brownish discharge from the vagina appears. This shows that the foetus is dead but still in the uterus. It degenerates into a solid mass of mostly organised blood clot called a carneous mole. This mole will in time be expelled with little or no loss of blood. This may be hastened by the administration of ergot and stilbesterol by mouth.

Refer all suspected cases of missed abortion to hospital for management as it may be necessary to carry out a surgical evacuation as well as to check the uterus for any abnormalities by performing an ultrasound.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_04_e48433557d58b46bddecg-31.jpg?height=513&width=779&top_left_y=264&top_left_x=250)

Missed Abortion Foetus is dead and there is retained placenta. There is also a brown vaginal discharge.

\section*{Habitual Abortion}

This is when a woman has had three or more successive abortions. In the majority of cases, the cause is not obvious. Some of the known causes however, include the following:
- Chronic illness, for example, diabetes mellitus.
- Abnormalities, for example, septate uterus and cervical incompetence being the most common, especially in late abortions.
- Endocrine or genetic causes, especially if it occurs before 14 weeks.
- Infections, for example, syphilis.

\section*{Habitual Abortion}

In the management of this patient, the following is performed:
- Take history and carry out a physical examination to establish the cause.
- Deal with the causes that can be managed, for example, if it is syphilis then treat.
- Advise on proper dietary intake, together with thyroid and hormonal supplements (but not diethylstilbestrol or other oestrogens).
- Establish a therapeutic supportive relationship with the patient to help her overcome the loss of her pregnancy.
- Surgically correct the obvious abnormalities of the genital tract, like removal of myomas and repair of an incompetent cervix.
- Provide appropriate pre and postoperative care as for any other surgical patient.

\section*{Septic Abortion}

In the past, this type of abortion was associated with the criminal interference of a pregnancy. However, it may occur in a spontaneous abortion, if there has been bacterial contamination. Septic abortion is usually caused by gram-negative Escherichia Coli (E. Coli) but sometimes gram-positive streptococci and staphylococci are also involved. In most cases, the infection is mild and limited to
the uterus.
The infection may be limited to the tubes or it may spread to the peritoneal cavity and cause peritonitis. Severe E. Coli infection may lead to septicaemic shock due to endotoxins released by the organism, thus leading to total vascular collapse (death).

The patient will present with:
- Fever due to the infection
- Fast, rapid pulse rate due to the infection and fever
- Offensive smelling vaginal discharge
- Tender lower abdomen on palpation
- Bright red blood continues to be lost

The management will include:
- Resuscitating with intravenous fluids.
- Administering antibiotics, both broad spectrum and perinatally.
- Evacuating infected products of conception as soon as possible.
- Taking history with an emphasis on why the abortion was performed.
- Taking relevant specimens for investigation.
- Ruling out infection in other systems.
- Assessing urinary output to rule out renal function interference.
- Monitoring vital signs carefully since a high temperature and rapid pulse will indicate the severity of the infection.
- Taking cervical swab for culture and sensitivity in order to institute treatment according to the findings.
- Encouraging plenty of fluid intake in order to flush the system of the toxins and correct dehydration.
- Performing vulva toilet four hourly with antiseptic.
- Administering tetanus toxoid or anti-tetanus serum 0.5 mls for treatment.

\section*{Induced Abortion}

Induced abortion is an abortion that is intentionally caused. It is commonly associated with young unmarried women, especially schoolgirls or even married women who get pregnant due to contraceptive failure. However, an induced abortion can also be performed for medical reasons.

There are two types of induced abortion: Therapeutic (which is performed on medical grounds) and Criminal (which is illegal).

According to medical ethics, a therapeutic abortion may be carried out only if two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion that the pregnancy should be terminated. There are two specific circumstances when this can be done. These are:
- If the continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of injury to her physical or mental health.
- If there is a substantial risk that the child, when born, would suffer from physical or mental abnormalities and be seriously handicapped.

Criminal abortions are sometimes attempted by an unqualified person. The operation is often hurried and lacking asepsis. The complications of criminal abortions include:
- Haemorrhage.
- Sepsis, which is usually severe and can lead to septicaemia and endotoxin shock.
- Haemolysis and renal damage may occur secondary to the septicaemia.
- Injuries to the birth canal and pelvic organs.
- Sudden death due to extreme syncope as a result of dilatation of the cervix and in some cases from amniotic embolism.

\section*{Remember:}

According to the laws of this country, induced abortion is a criminal offence, unless it is done on medical grounds.

The illustration below shows the outcome of therapeutic and threatened abortions. Note that threatened abortions are usually spontaneous.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_04_e48433557d58b46bddecg-34.jpg?height=521&width=766&top_left_y=363&top_left_x=262)

\section*{Post-Abortal Care (PAC)}

PAC comprises the comprehensive health care provided to patients with problems of incomplete abortion. It has three interrelated components, which are:
- Emergency treatment of complications arising from spontaneous or induced abortion.
- Family planning counselling and services.
- Access to comprehensive reproductive health care.

These are the major components for PAC, which various health care providers/groups may provide.

You should ensure the control and prevention of cross-infection when performing procedures. Thus, it is important to remember the infection prevention principles, which you covered in the previous unit on Contraceptive Technology.

\section*{Care After Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA)}

You should check the patient's vital signs, severe vaginal bleeding and general condition and allow the patient to rest comfortably.

Patients that have been treated should receive after care guidance, which includes:
- Explain/counsel patient before discharge that she will be at risk of repeat pregnancy for up to two weeks following treatment.
- Counsel her on a variety of safe contraceptive methods that can be used immediately to avoid pregnancy for the body to return to its normal state.
- Explain where and how to get family planning.
- Counsel on all available family planning methods to enable the patient to make an informed choice of family planning methods.
- Explain how to use the selected family planning method.
- Explain that family planning methods, other than condoms do not provide protection against STI/HIV/AIDS.

As mentioned on the previous page, patients that have been treated should receive after care guidance, which also includes:
- Informing her about symptoms that would require the patient to return immediately to the facility and the action she should take.
- Advising her on signs of recovery when normal menstruation may resume.
- Advising her on personal hygiene and when to resume sex.
- Providing the method of choice to the patient.
- Helping the patient to cope with the pregnancy loss.
- Allowing grieving.

\section*{Ectopic Pregnancy (Extrauterine Pregnancy)}

Ectopic pregnancy is a condition in which the zygote becomes implanted in a place outside the uterine cavity. The most common site of ectopic gestation is inside one of the fallopian tubes and this is called a tubal pregnancy. The term ectopic is derived from a Greek word, which means 'out of place'.

\section*{Can you remember the other sites where the zygote can implant outside the uterine cavity?}

Did you remember the other less common sites?
- The ovary
- The cervix
- The abdominal cavity

The illustration below shows the different possible locations of an ectopic pregnancy with relative frequency occurrence.
Key

The most common type of ectopic pregnancy is the tubal pregnancy, occurring in at least 55\% of ectopic pregnancies. This type of pregnancy is common in the tropics because of the high incidence of blocked tubes due to gonorrhoea, puerperal and post abortal sepsis, and Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases (PIDs).

The ovum is fertilised in the fallopian tube but the zygote is unable to reach the uterine cavity because of loss of mobility and ciliary action. Therefore, the ovum may be arrested at:
- The fimbriated end of the tube, which is an uncommon site.
- The ampulla which is the most common site.
- The isthmus which is the most dangerous site because of the frequency of tubal rupture at about four to five weeks.
- The interstitial part of the tube in which rupture begins at second trimester. It is also an uncommon site.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_04_e48433557d58b46bddecg-37.jpg?height=766&width=765&top_left_y=262&top_left_x=249)

In many African countries, including Kenya, ruptured tubal pregnancy is the most common surgical emergency in women. Consequently, it is very important that you know how this condition presents and how it is managed.

From the description of the types of ectopic pregnancies you can now easily identify their causes.
Some of the common causes of ectopic pregnancy include:
- Previous inflammatory process in the tube or acute PID, which will heal with scarring tissue and block the tube.
- Peritoneal adhesions secondary to previous surgery due to, for example, appendicitis, may cause occlusion.
- Endometriosis whereby the endometrial tissue is lodged in the tube and occludes the tubal lumen.
- Congenital anatomical irregularity often due to presence of diverticula of the uterine tube.
- Tubal surgery.

\section*{Pathophysiology of Ectopic Pregnancy}

Once the implantation has occurred in the tube, the sequence of events associated with pregnancy follows. The corpus luteum remains and grows, producing progesterone, which increases the thickness of the endometrium and ensures that it is not shed, so that the patient misses the period.

The tube is not, however, able to nourish the ovum for long and bleeding detaches the ovum. The ovum may be ejected into the peritoneal cavity through the fimbriated end. The onset of pain may be gradual or it may occur dramatically.

\section*{Symptoms and Signs of Ectopic Pregnancy}

Unfortunately, an ectopic pregnancy causes very few symptoms until the foetus has become large enough to rupture the fallopian tube. This, therefore, makes it very difficult to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy before it ruptures. That is why it is very important that you refer a patient to hospital on the slightest suspicion of ectopic pregnancy.

The muscle wall of the tube does not have the capacity of the uterine muscle for hypertrophy and distension and tubal pregnancies nearly always end in rupture and the death of the ovum.

\section*{Before Rupture}

You should suspect an ectopic pregnancy before rupture if a woman comes to you with the following complaints:
- Amenorrhoea of two or three months (common in about $80 \%$ of cases). The patient may sometimes present with a ruptured ectopic even before the expected date of the next period.
- Vague lower abdominal pain, which the patient might ignore. This is due to slight leakage of blood from the tube, which causes localised peritoneal irritation. It may also be due to the distension of the tube by the growing foetus.

On examination the patient is usually healthy. You might feel a slightly enlarged uterus or a mass on one side of the uterus.

\section*{After Rupture}

When the tubal pregnancy ruptures, usually after two to three months, the patient presents with the following complaints. For the acute type of rupture, also known as fulminating, they complain of:
- Sudden onset of low abdominal pain.
- Vomiting and fainting because of the sudden intraperitoneal bleeding.
- Vaginal bleeding, this may not develop until many hours after the rupture.
- If bleeding is rapid it may lead to hypotension and shock.

For the chronic leaking type, the patient complains of:
- Suffering for some time from abdominal uneasiness.
- Pain.
- Occasional fainting.
- Haemorrhagic slight bleeding.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_04_e48433557d58b46bddecg-39.jpg?height=285&width=760&top_left_y=1565&top_left_x=265)

The chronic rupture is the most common type of rupture of tubal pregnancy that you are likely to encounter. Unfortunately, in many cases, whenever health workers talk about an ectopic pregnancy, they only think of the acute type, that is a woman who develops sudden severe abdominal pain and collapses.

You must remember that not all ectopic pregnancies present in the acute type. In fact, in clinical practice, some of these patients have been wrongly managed as either threatened abortion or acute pelvic inflammatory disease. That is why an ectopic pregnancy has been called 'the great deceiver'.

\section*{Remember:}

\section*{Diagnostic errors of an ectopic pregnancy may be fatal.}

Now move on to look at each of the two clinical types of ruptured ectopic pregnancy

\section*{Acute Rupture of Ectopic Pregnancy}

A woman with acute ectopic pregnancy may present as discussed earlier with the following:
- Sudden onset of lower abdominal pain.
- Vomiting and fainting because of the sudden intraperitoneal bleeding.
- Vaginal bleeding, though this may not develop until some hours after rupture of the tube and the death of the foetus.

On examination you might detect the following signs:
- The patient is in agonising pain and is restless.
- She is sweating, yet her skin feels cold and her palms are wet.
- She yawns frequently as if hungry for air.
- The radial pulse is rapid, weak and thready. The blood pressure may be very low or unrecordable.
- The temperature is usually normal.
- The abdomen is very tender with muscle guarding. Signs of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity, such as a fluid thrill and shifting dullness, might be detected if the patient can tolerate the examination. However, the absence of these signs does not mean that there is no free blood in the peritoneal cavity as the blood might be in small amounts.
- A pelvic examination is very painful and it is difficult to palpate the organs properly so it is important that you remember to be very gentle.
- There is extreme pain on moving the cervix with the examining fingers, that is, the cervix is excitable.
- The uterus is often slightly enlarged and a tender mass might be felt on one side of the uterus.
- A tender mass may also be palpated in the pouch of Douglas if blood is clotted there. This is also known as pelvic haematocele.
- The patient is usually anaemic.

\section*{Remember:}

A sudden, severe collapse with little or no warning signs generally occurs when the
zygote is implanted in the isthmus and there may be no history of a missed menstrual period.

\section*{Differential Diagnosis of the Acute Ruptured Ectopic Pregnancy}

A ruptured ectopic gestation may be confused with many other conditions such as acute pelvic inflammatory disease, rupture of a gastric or duodenal ulcer, fulminating appendicitis, torsion of the pedicle of an ovarian cyst, acute pyelonephritis and/or rupture of a corpus luteum with intraperitoneal haemorrhage.

\section*{Remember:}

In abortion, bleeding usually precedes pain, while in ruptured tubal pregnancy pain almost invariably precedes bleeding.

In the next sub-section you will study the symptoms and signs of chronic leaking ectopic pregnancy.

\section*{Chronic Leaking Ectopic Pregnancy}

In this type of pregnancy, it is very important to note the clinical history of the patient. You should check for the following:
- Abdominal pain and uneasiness, where the pain is generally situated low down in the abdomen and, often, is more marked on one side. It is continuous and is not relieved by pressure, as is the case in intestinal colic. Sometimes the act of emptying the bladder initiates a bout of pain. In a few cases the patient complains of a frequent inclination to go and pass stool.
- Amenorrhoea is usually present, with irregular vaginal bleeding, which is usually slight and often dark brown in colour. It is not uncommon to attribute this discharge to threatened abortion.
- Occasionally there is expulsion of a decidual cast, especially if the pregnancy has gone beyond two months. The patient will give you an impression that she had a miscarriage. In some cases the health worker may carry out an evacuation thinking the patient has experienced an incomplete abortion.
- Occasionally there is a feeling of nausea, vomiting and fainting attacks. Remember that sudden faintness is a characteristic symptom of ectopic gestation.

When you examine the patient you are likely to find the following signs:
- Anaemia of variable degrees.
- Rapid pulse.
- Normal or low blood pressure.
- General tenderness and guarding in the lower abdomen, which is more marked on one side.
- There may be a tender, firm mass in one of the iliac fossae.
- On vaginal examination you will feel a tender mass in one of the fornices.

\section*{Management of Ectopic Pregnancy}

A patient with tubal pregnancy will require an emergency operation. The patient should be immediately referred to a hospital. Start an intravenous drip of normal saline before transferring the patient. During the transfer, ensure that you treat the patient for shock and administer analgesics like morphine or pethidine for the pain. Potential blood donors should accompany the patient to hospital where possible.

In the hospital, the following diagnostic tests may be performed:
- Ultrasonography.
- Culdocentesis whereby non-clotting blood will be aspirated from the cul-de-sac.
- Human Chorionic Gonadorophin (HCG), which involves urine testing.

Blood is taken for grouping and cross-matching and a blood transfusion is started. An emergency laparatomy is then performed to ligate the bleeders. The affected tube is usually removed by salpingectomy or salpingotomy, which involves making an opening in the tube.

It may be possible to give an auto-transfusion to a patient with a fresh rupture of a tubal pregnancy. Auto-transfusion involves scooping blood from the opened abdomen with a small gallipot and pouring it through a filter made of three or four layers of gauze into a sterile bowel or jug containing sodium acid citrate solution, which is an anti-coagulant. When 500 ml of blood have been collected it is decanted into a sterile bottle, which is then set up on a drip that is already running. Sometimes the blood is aspirated directly from the peritoneal cavity into a
plastic transfusion bag containing sodium
citrate solution.
Auto-transfusion is not advisable if:
- The history of the patient suggests that heavy bleeding began more than 24 hours before the operation.
- The blood appears discoloured or haemolysed.
- There is an offensive odour when the abdomen is opened.

The advantages of auto-transfusion include:
- No risk of transmitting HIV.
- Blood is easily available and perfectly compatible.

However serious the patient's condition appears to be, this operation has an excellent success rate. Post-operatively, the patient should be managed in the same manner as for any other abdominal operation.

After surgical treatment, there are several potential outcomes.
- Another tubal pregnancy will occur in about $10 \%$ of the cases treated.
- Infertility develops in approximately half of the patients who have undergone surgery for the treatment of an ectopic pregnancy. Of these about $30 \%$ become sterile.
- Normal pregnancies are achieved in about half of patients who have one ectopic pregnancy.

\section*{Section 4: Genital Disorders and Injuries}

\section*{Introduction}

In this section, you are going to look at some disorders of the genital tract and injuries. They shall be explained under the following grouping:
- Vulva dystrophies and cysts
- Relaxation of pelvic support
- Traumatic disorders of the genital organs

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Explain dystrophies and cysts affecting the genital tract
- State the causes and management of relaxation of pelvic muscles
- Describe the management and prevention of trauma to genital organs

\section*{Vulva Dystrophies and Cysts (1 of 5)}

Dystrophy refers to the defective nutrition of an organ or tissue, usually muscle. There are various types of dystrophies and these will now be explained in detail.

\section*{Atrophic Lesions}

This is due to ageing when there is a decrease in endogenous oestrogen. Atrophic changes in the vulva skin and sub-dermal tissues usually occur after some years.

Lichen sclerosis is a systemic dermatological condition and the most common cause of atrophic dystrophy. There will be contractures of the vaginal introitus and the skin becomes thin, fragile and easily traumatised. Its chief symptoms include:
- Dysuria
- Pruritis
- Dyspareunia

The vulva is the skin surface most frequently affected, although the skin of the back, axilla and beneath the arms may also be affected.

\section*{Hypertrophic Dystrophies}

Chronic irritation or vulvo-vaginal infection may result in benign epithelial thickening and hyperkeratosis. During the acute phases, as in diabetic vulvitis, the lesions may be red and moist, which provide evidence of secondary infection. The lesions may involve any portion of the vulva, adjacent thighs, perineum or perineal skin.

Invasive malignancies may also appear as white lesions of the vulvar skin. A biopsy should be able to detect whether malignancy exists or not. Periodic re-examination of specimen biopsies and the excision of more advanced lesions should be performed.

\section*{Management of Lesions}

The atrophic lesions and hypertrophic dystrophy lesions are both treated in the same manner.
Pruritis, dyspareunia and urinary symptoms resulting from oestrogen withdrawal, respond to local applications of oestrogenic creams. Specific treatment should be administered for vaginal infections, if present.

Topical corticosteroids, for example, $0.01 \%$ fluocinolone acetonide cream has proved helpful in hypertrophic lesions. A mixture of $1 \%$ hydrocortisone and 2 to $3 \%$ testoserone three to four times daily has been found to be particularly beneficial in the treatment of lichen sclerosis.

\section*{Remember:}

Warn the patient not to apply an excess of testosterone because it may cause systemic virilising effects in addition to an increase in hair growth.

\section*{Prognosis}

In the absence of malignancy, the principal goal is to relieve symptoms, which mainly consist of pruritis.

Periodic re-examination is also necessary to detect any malignant changes.

\section*{Bartholin's Abscess or Cyst}

Can you remember where the Bartholin's gland is situated? See the illustration opposite to help you visualise it.

The most common cause of Bartholin's cyst is a gonococcal infection that causes obstruction. However, another probable cause is congenital narrowing of the duct. The patient will present with:
- Oedematous and inflamed tissues around the Bartholin's gland
- Fluctuant mass, usually palpable
- Small non-inflamed cysts are asymptomatic unless progressive enlargement compromises the vaginal introitus or acute infection intervenes
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_04_e48433557d58b46bddecg-47.jpg?height=518&width=815&top_left_y=1099&top_left_x=238)

\section*{Treatment of Bartholin's Cyst}

The main treatment for this condition is Incision and Drainage (I\&D) of the infected cyst or abscess and preferably marsupialisation, which allows the abscess to drain properly thus preserving the function of the gland. The drained pus should be sent for culture and sensitivity to detect any gonococcal infections.

The patient should be put on appropriate antibiotics.
Do not forget this condition is very painful, which means the patient should also be given analgesics.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_04_e48433557d58b46bddecg-48.jpg?height=472&width=373&top_left_y=268&top_left_x=464)

\section*{Relaxation of Pelvic Support (1 of 13)}

There are three muscles in the pelvic floor known as:
- The iliococcygeus
- The pubococcygeus
- The puborectalis

In addition, the perineal body is made up of bulbocavernosus muscles and superficial transverse perineal muscles. The two muscles insert into the midline of the perineum, posterior to the vaginal introitus and anterior to the rectum.

The lower rectum and vagina are supported by the bulbocavernosus. The urethra, vagina and rectum are supported by the endopelvic in the middle of the pelvis.

The cardinal ligament and uterosacral ligaments assist in suspending the uterus and adjacent organs so that they do not prolapse whenever there is increase in intra-abdominal pressure.

Excessive stretching and trauma may result in tears of the endopelvic fascia. This allows the base of the bladder to drop posteriorly forming a cystocele. Subsequently the urethra falls away from its normal position behind the symphysis pubis and forms an urethrocele.

The fascial support in the pelvis of Caucasian women seems to be more susceptible to being damaged than that of oriental/black women for reasons that are not yet well understood.

Now move on to look at three conditions that are related to relaxation of the pelvic support. These are cystocele, rectocele, and uterine prolapse.

\section*{Cystocele}

This is the herniation of the bladder through the anterior vaginal wall. It may be classified into the following degrees:
- Mild cystocele, where the anterior vaginal wall prolapses to the introitus upon straining.
- Moderate cystocele, where the vaginal wall extends beyond the introitus upon straining.
- Severe cystocele, where the vaginal wall extends beyond introitus in the resting state.

A small cystocele will generally cause no significant symptoms but if it is a large one, the following symptoms may be noticed:
- It will bulge out of the vaginal introitus and make the patient complain of vaginal pressure or it may manifest as a protruding mass that may give her feeling that she is 'sitting on a ball'.
- Symptoms are aggravated by vigorous activity, prolonged standing, coughing, sneezing or straining. They are relieved by resting and assuming a recumbent or knee-chest position.
- Urinary incontinence or incomplete bladder emptying feeling which may lead to frequent micturition.

\section*{Management of Cystocele}

The management of a patient with this condition will include investigations using urinalysis, x ray and/or cystoscopy. If the patient is suffering from a small or moderate cystocele, she should be reassured that it is not a serious condition. A woman of childbearing age should not have corrective surgery until she has borne her children. She will need conservative management, which will include:
- The insertion of a pessary or tampon in the lower part of the vagina, which may provide temporary support. However note that prolonged use may eventually lead to pressure necrosis and vaginal lacerations.
- Exercises in young patients will give definite improvement of pressure symptoms.
- Oestrogen in post-menopausal women for a number of months may greatly improve the tone, quality and vascularity of musculo-fascial support.
- Surgical measures especially for large cystoceles, causing retention and recurrent bladder infection. The most common measure is anterior-vaginal colporrhaphy, which ensures the most effective surgical correction of a cystocele. By preventing further pregnancies, a hysterectomy averts the problem of vaginal delivery, which would destroy the bladder support provided by the anterior colporrhaphy.

\section*{Prevention of Cystocele}
- A woman should do intrapartum and postpartum exercises, especially those designed to strengthen the levator and perineal muscles groups.
- Correct or avoid obesity, chronic coughs, straining and traumatic deliveries.
- Oestrogen therapy maintains the musculo-fascial tissue after menopause and prevents or postpones the appearance of cystocele and other forms of pelvic relaxation.

The prognosis for recovery is excellent after surgery in the absence of subsequent deliveries or stress that increases intra-abdominal pressure.

\section*{Rectocele}

This is the herniation of the rectum through the posterior vaginal wall. Some of the causes of this condition include:
- Disruption of the fibrous connective tissue (recto-vaginal fascia) between the rectum and vagina during childbirth.
- Operative deliveries, especially of a large foetus or breech delivery.
- Slow involutional changes in the pelvic musculo-fascial supporting tissues as a result of menopause.
- Bowel habits whereby lifelong chronic constipation with straining at stool causes this condition.

\section*{Remember:}

Early and adequate episiotomy reduces the amount of damage to the recto-vaginal fascial supporting tissues.

\section*{Clinical Diagnosis}

A small rectocele is usually demonstrable in virtually all multiparous patients and usually causes no symptoms but the following are essentials of diagnosis:
- Difficult evacuation of faeces.
- Sensation of vaginal fullness expressed as 'falling-out' pressure.
- Presence of soft, reducible mass bulging into lower half of the posterior vaginal wall, frequently a flat lacerated perineal body.

\section*{Management of Rectocele}

The management of this condition will include digital extraction if there is faecal impaction. In the long term, it is advisable to wait until the woman has had all the babies she wants in order to intervene especially for rectocele causing symptoms. Surgically, posterior colpoperineorrhaphy is usually curative. To ensure permanent integrity of the rectocele repair, the patient should be advised to avoid straining, coughing and other strenuous activities and prevent constipation through a proper diet, plenty of fluid intake and the use of stool softening laxatives and lubricating suppositories.

Recurrence of the condition after adequate repair is uncommon if chronic constipation has also been corrected. Subsequent vaginal deliveries should be avoided, hence pointing to the need for elective Caesarean section.

\section*{Can you think of any complications that may arise from rectocele and cystocele?}

Some of the complications that may arise from rectocele and cystocele include:
- Leukorrhoea or increased vaginal discharge.
- Abnormal uterine bleeding.
- Abortion as a result of infection or disordered uterine or ovarian circulation in the prolapse.
- Urinary tract infection is common with prolapse because of the cystocele and urethra obstruction with hydronephrosis.
- Haemorrhoids due to straining with constipation, especially with rectocele.

\section*{Uterine Prolapse}

A uterine prolapse is the abnormal protrusion of the uterus through the pelvic floor aperture or genital hiatus. Uterine prolapse can be classified into the following degrees.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_04_e48433557d58b46bddecg-51.jpg?height=676&width=660&top_left_y=1375&top_left_x=307)

First DegreeSlight descent of the uterus. Cervix remains within the vagina.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_04_e48433557d58b46bddecg-52.jpg?height=675&width=660&top_left_y=313&top_left_x=307)

Second Degree Cervix projects beyond the vulva when the patient strains.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_04_e48433557d58b46bddecg-52.jpg?height=676&width=659&top_left_y=1283&top_left_x=310)

Third degree (procidentia) The entire uterus has prolapsed outside the vulva

The most likely causes of uterine prolapse will be:
- Uterine prolapse occurs most commonly in multiparous women, like the cystocele and rectocele conditions with which it is usually associated.
- In Caucasian women, it occurs as the result of gradually progressive injuries to the endopelvic fascia due to childbirth and lacerations of muscles, especially the levator muscles and those of the perineal body.
- The condition may also be the result of pelvic tumour, sacral nerve disorders, especially injury to the S1-4, diabetic neuropathy, caudal anaesthesia accident and pre-sacral tumour.

Additional factors promoting uterine prolapse include systemic conditions like obesity, asthma, chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis. Also important are local conditions like ascites, large uterus and ovarian tumours. A congenital type is seen in newborn infants during vigorous crying or vomiting (this type is common among the Pokot in Kenya).

A uterus that is in retroverted position is especially subject to prolapse. Prolonged labour may play a causal role and the condition is said to be more common amongst those who lead a largely sedentary life, usually with individuals who are immobile and/or obese.

\section*{Clinical Findings of Uterine Prolapse}

Symptoms of uterine prolapse include:
- Pelvic pressure manifested by sensation of fullness in the vagina.
- Low backache.
- Uterus may protrude between the labia.
- Cervix may become eroded and may bleed due to drying effect on mucous membrane, especially in the third degree.
- Firm mass palpable in the lower vagina.
- Patient complains of dyspareunia due to trauma on the cervix during coitus.
- Leukorrhoea due to uterine engorgement.
- Compression and distortion of the bladder by the displaced uterus and cervix may lead to accumulation of residual urine, which leads to urinary tract infection, urgency and dribbling of urine due to overflow incontinence.

\section*{Can you think how the problem of uterine prolapse can be prevented?}

Did you remember these points? You will need to do or advise mothers on the following:
- The importance of pre-natal and postnatal 'Kegel' exercises to strengthen levator muscles.
- The need for early and adequate episiotomy during the second stage of delivery.
- Traumatic deliveries should be avoided at all cost.
- Prolonged oestrogen therapy for menopausal and postmenopausal women tends to maintain the tone and integrity of the endopelvic fascia and pelvic floor musculature, and can therefore, act as a preventive measure.

\section*{Management of Uterine Prolapse}

This should include surgical measures as well as investigations on the haemoglobin level, blood group, urea and urinalysis to detect any other abnormalities and also as a preparation for surgical intervention. Give the patient antibiotics and dressings, especially for third degree cases, after which a vaginal hysterectomy may be performed. For first and second degree cases, and for women of a reproductive age, Manchester repair is carried out. This entails colporrhaphy and amputation of the cervix.

Medical measures will include:
- Vaginal pessaries (inflatable doughnut) as a palliative measure if surgical treatment is contra-indicated or as a temporary measure to mild to moderate prolapse.
- Oestrogen therapy (systemically or vaginally) administered to post-menopausal women to improve the tissue tone.
- Dilatation and curettage may be necessary to investigate for malignancy if there is bleeding.
- Vaginal creams and/or medicated tampons may be useful.
- Urinary tract infection or cardiovascular complication should be treated appropriately.
- Enema or laxatives should be prescribed to help with constipation.
- Obese patients should be advised to try and lose weight.

\section*{Prognosis of Uterine Prolapse}

Vaginal hysterectomy with anteroposterior colporrhaphy provides excellent and permanent vaginal support and if good healing occurs, preservation of vaginal functions as well. Recurrence may result from unrepaired cystocele and rectocele or from occupational factors such as heavy lifting or straining.

You will now move on to the final part of this section and look at traumatic disorders of the genital organs.

\section*{Traumatic Disorders of the Genital Organs (1 of 9)}

Injury to the genital organs may be as a result of gynaecological or obstetric surgery. Fistula may occur due to direct or indirect occlusion, as a result of angulation or obstruction.

\section*{Vulva}

Injuries may be in the form of bruises or lacerations. These will heal by themselves as long as hygienic measures are observed.

\section*{Perineum}

The injuries here may include primary tearing involving vaginal mucosa, secondary tearing involving vaginal mucosa plus skin, or third degree tearing involving vagina mucosa, skin and muscles.

Tears are usually termed as 'fresh' within 24 hours of occurrence and can be repaired. After 48 hours they are deemed 'old' and they cannot be repaired until healed.

\section*{Vagina}

The injuries to this organ may be bruises or lacerations. If oozing is present, then a vaginal pack is required. Alternatively, the vagina may have to be repaired.

\section*{Cervix}

Injuries here may be in the form of bruises, lacerations and/or tears. Bleeding which is oozing or active will need a vaginal pack. For tears with active bleeding, the area should be repaired under general anaesthesia because unrepaired tears will lead to cervical incompetence causing mid-trimester abortion.

\section*{Uterus}

The uterus can be perforated as a result of poor technique of IUCD insertion or dilatation and curettage. The rupture may be either partial or total. It can be repaired if perforated or partially ruptured but with total rupture, a sub-total abdominal hysterectomy is required.

\section*{Fistula}

Fistula means 'a pipe'. It is defined as an abnormal, winding opening between two internal hollow organs.

The most common areas in the genital tract that may be connected abnormally are:

Vagina to bladder - Vesicovaginal Fistula (VVF)
Rectum to vagina - Rectovaginal Fistula (RVF)
Urethra to vagina - Urethrovaginal (UVF)
Urinary fistula however, can occur at many sites. Study the illustration opposite.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_04_e48433557d58b46bddecg-56.jpg?height=592&width=746&top_left_y=726&top_left_x=256)

Some common causes of fistula include:
- Obstructed labour due to pressure by the presenting part, causing necrosis. This accounts for $85 \%$ of cases in developing countries.
- Radiation therapy for gynaecological conditions, which accounts for $15 \%$ of cases (usually many years after treatment).
- Disease processes, such as carcinoma in advanced stages of the neighbouring organs.
- Chronic tuberculosis or syphilis.
- Congenital fistula, that is, an accessory ectopic ureter, which may open into the vagina. This condition can be recognised in childhood.

The main symptoms and diagnosis of VVF include:
- The patient keeps on complaining of constant dribbling of urine from the vagina and generally does not pass any urine by the normal route.
- On inspection with Sim's speculum, the fistula is situated in the midline half way up the anterior vaginal wall. This usually occurs as a result of prolonged labour. Postoperative fistulas are generally higher up.
- Small fistulae admit a probe with difficulty, but may be seen on cystoscopy. Large fistulae admit one or two fingers.
- Coloured fluid (methylene blue) runs into the bladder through a catheter and immediately flows out into the vagina.

This condition may also affect the individual patient in different ways. Some patients report that they do not experience any sexual enjoyment. In addition, there is the possibility of psychogenic amenorrhea and vulval excoriation with urine. The individual may feel like a social outcast.

\section*{Rectovaginal Fistula (RVF)}

Most of the rectovaginal fistula are as a result of unrepaired third degree lacerations of the perineum and posterior vaginal wall, or repairs that have broken down so that an opening is left from the rectum into the vagina. Advanced cancer of the rectum or vagina can also cause RVF but this is rare.

Common symptoms of RVF include:
- With small fistulae, only mucus from the rectum may leak into the vagina. If the fistula are larger, faeces and flatus escape into the vagina.
- The patient will complain of feculent vaginal discharge.
- An inspection of the posterior wall of the vagina and the use of a probe will demonstrate the smaller fistula.
- Perineal excoriation due to leakage of urine and faecal matter.
- Symptoms may also depend on the site of the fistulae. If on the lower half of the vagina there is incontinence, flatus, or fluid faeces while if on the upper half there is continuous passage of faeces per vaginum.

\section*{Management of VVF and RVF}

First and foremost, prevention is easier than cure. In most cases fistulae formation can be avoided by:
- Ensuring that labour does not go beyond 12 hours.
- Frequent emptying of bladder or catheterisation during normal labour since a distended bladder is easily traumatised by the pressure of the presenting part, especially in cephalic presentation.
- Control of infection and excoriation (use of infection prevention principles).
- In the event of destructive delivery due to prolonged labour, catheters should be left in situation for 48 hours to seven days.
- For VVF, recently formed fistulae will heal if the bladder is drained continuously for 21 to 28 days and for RVF, a low residue diet should be given for the same period.

Where surgery is indicated, it is important that fresh VVF is repaired at once. However, if it is only noticed some days after the injury, then two to three months should be allowed to elapse before the repair. This allows local damage and infection to settle and urinary infection to be eradicated. Most VVF can be closed by an operation via the vaginal route.

In the management of a patient who is due for surgical correction the pre-operative care will include:
- Blood for haemoglobin level, urea, Intravenous Pyelography (IVP) for ureteric fistula.
- Examination Under Anaesthesia (EUA) to detect the type of fistulae.
- Dye test (methylene blue) into the bladder to detect site of fistulae.
- Nursing care, including proper nutrition to ensure fitness for the operation.
- The woman will need a lot of encouragement and support since it can be a very distressing time.

After surgical correction, the following specific care should be given:
- Great care should be taken to secure constant drainage of the bladder to enable the repair to heal well. The catheter should remain in situ for 10 to 14 days.
- Relieve discomfort, give analgesics.
- Prevent infection by giving prescribed antibiotics.
- Ensure proper nutrition with increased intake of vitamin C and proteins but low residue.
- Ensure maintenance of local cleanliness through douching, enema and warm perineal irrigation.
- RVF is repaired after a course of antibiotics to reduce bowel infection.
- Also sterilise the gut with tabs cabbracol 500 gm BD for five days.
- Give enema on the morning of the operation.
- After the operation, the patient should be placed on a liquid diet for two weeks.
- Liquid paraffin 10 ml tds for two weeks, followed by analgesics and broad spectrum antibiotics.

Together with the above, ensure that you provide other general postoperative care, for example, regular observation and personal hygiene.

\section*{Remember:}

Once the fistula is repaired, the patient should always opt for elective caesarean section delivery.

\section*{Section 5: Infertility and Climacteric Crisis}

\section*{Introduction}

This section covers both infertility and climacteric crisis and the menopause in women. The Kenyan government, in its policies and guidelines on reproductive health, includes infertility and climacteric problems as components of reproductive health in essential obstetric care.

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of this section you will be able to:
- Describe infertility and climacteric crisis
- Specify causative factors of infertility
- Describe the management of infertile couples
- Specify climacteric symptoms
- Describe the management of a woman who presents with menopause

\section*{Infertility (1 of 15)}

Most normal couples achieve a pregnancy within a few months of trying. However, failure to do so after one year may be arbitrarily defined as infertility, provided that normal intercourse is taking place not less than twice a week. But what is the difference between infertility and sterility?
- Infertility is 'the inability to achieve a pregnancy or to carry a pregnancy to term after one year of unprotected intercourse'.
- Sterility is 'the inability to produce offspring, i.e. the inability to conceive (female sterility) or to induce conception (male sterility)'.

There are two types of infertility; primary and secondary. In primary infertility, no conception has taken place at all. In secondary infertility, there may have been some conception even if it ended in a spontaneous abortion.

There are several causes of infertility, which will be covered here under three broad categories general factors, female factors and male factors.

\section*{General Factors Affecting Fertility}

\section*{Age}

In the female conception occurs at any time after menarche and before menopause. It is rare in the first few cycles and the last few cycles before menopause because the cycles are usually anovular.

Fertility in women is at its height in the late teens and early twenties. It declines slowly after 30 years of age. In the male, spermatogenesis commences actively at puberty and continues throughout life but ageing reduces fertility to a variable extent.

\section*{Health and Nutrition}

Good health is associated with fertility but bad health is not an absolute barrier to conception, except when ovulation and spermatogenesis are directly affected.

Deliberate dieting (condition known as anorexia nervosa) will lead to loss of weight, which in turn will lead to amenorrhea, hence failure to ovulate. On the other hand, sometimes obesity and infertility seem to be connected in women, probably because obese women ovulate and menstruate less frequently.

Chronic alcoholism or drug addiction may also lead to infertility. For example, morphine tends to depress ovarian activity.

\section*{Psychological Factors}

Anxiety and tension seem to be responsible for infertility in some individuals. They manifest through changes in the neuroendocrine control of ovulation.

\section*{Female Factors Affecting Fertility}

Some of the causes of infertility in females include:
- Congenital, also known as Mullerian agenesis, where there is no uterus or ovaries. Another factor is vaginal atresia, which is the narrowing or stenosis of the vagina.
- Infections leading to tubal blockage, for example, sexually transmitted infections (gonococcal, chlamydia), tuberculosis, salmonella, enterobias vermicularis and postabortal or puerperal sepsis.
- Endocrine due to pituitary adenoma with increased prolactin leading to inappropriate galactorrhoea which is associated with amenorrhoea and anovulation. Hormonal
imbalance with increased oestrogen will lead to endometrial hyperplasia hence irregular period (metropathia haemorrhagica) or prolonged periods and cycles. Hypothyroidism is generally associated with infertility.
- Diabetes mellitus, if uncontrolled or in those with severe complications may impair fertility.
- Uterine fibromyoma, especially if it is large enough to distort the uterine cavity or block interstitial parts of the tube, may also cause recurrent abortion.
- Cervical hostility, whereby the cervical mucus is unreceptive to spermatozoa and either prevents their progressive advance or actually kills them. It may be due to infection or the presence of sperm antibodies.
- Cervical incompetence is almost always a cause of mid-trimester abortion and will lead to secondary infertility.
- Endometriosis because of the menorrhagia may lead to infertility.

\section*{Male Factors Affecting Fertility}

The following factors in the male may lead to infertility.
- Congenital, for example, hypospadias (ventral external urethra meatus) where the opening is congenitally malformed.
- Undescended testes, where the testes either remain in the abdominal or inguinal canal or are retractile, that is, tend to go back in the abdomen. Take note that the temperature of scrotal contents is about $1^{\circ}$ Centigrade below the normal body temperature.
Spermatogenesis is impaired if the temperature of the testes is raised and this is often the case with undescended testes. The temperature can also be raised by frequent hot baths, the use of thick, tight underclothes as well as living at high altitudes for too long.
- Infections of bacterial origin, for example, gonococcal chlamydia will block the vas deferens after healing with scarring. Viral infection, especially mumps, can cause orchitis, interfering with spermatogenesis. Therefore, a male child suffering from mumps should be observed keenly for this complication.
- Auto-immune problems whereby the cervix can be hostile to the sperm of a man and produce antibodies.
- Impotence where there is no erection for unknown reasons.
- Ignorance of coitus and in some cases excessive coitus.
- Less sperm count (oligospermia ) or no sperms at all (azoospermia).
- Endocrine disorders, for example, pituitary failure, adrenal hyperplasia or thyroid deficiency.

\section*{Remember:}

Examine every newborn male at birth to detect undescended testes in order to prevent the problem of infertility later.

\section*{Management of Infertility}

Infertility is a very stressful condition with a continuous cycle of hope and disappointment. Life centres around trying to conceive a baby and nothing else seems important. Partners blame each other and become frustrated and guilty. Patients should be managed by a gynaecologist, whose scope of intervention will depend on the services or technology available.

The couple should be investigated based on their general reproductive history. Clinical examination of each partner is carried out separately and any worries should be elicited and confidential information obtained from each partner.

In the male partner the following should be done. Take a history of sexual function, erection and ejaculation. Any past history of orchitis or STDs should be noted. It is important to establish how often intercourse takes place, whether there is any experience of difficulty in either partners, discomfort or lack of satisfaction (the male orgasm which brings about ejaculation of the semen is essential for fertilisation).

A clinical examination should also be done and should include an assessment of the size and consistency of the testes and epididymis on each side. You should also assess for the presence or absence of varicocele or hernia and the size of the prostate. Plan for action after the initial history and examination will include semen analysis. This should normally be the first step in an investigation because if there are no sperms present in the semen, it is pointless to investigate the female.

Prior to semen analysis, in preparation to collect specimen, the man abstains from coitus for three to five days and a masturbation specimen is then collected. It should be received in the laboratory within half an hour. In semen analysis, examine colour (if sturdy, then it is infected), viscosity, bacteriology (if pus cells present), motility (progressive, sluggish or no movement), morphology (the ideal is $50 \%$ ) and sperm count ( 40 to 370 million sperms per cc). Note that in Kenya 20 million is considered an acceptable sperm count.

If the serum contains sperm antibodies, the spermatozoa become immobilised when they come into contact with the cervical mucus. The test should be done three times. Once the seminal fluid analysis has been done and found to be normal, then the next step is to test for ovulation and tubal patency in the female.

In the female partner, attention should be paid to any endocrine abnormality. A routine pelvic examination should also be performed. During history-taking, the following should be ascertained:
- Any illness which might have caused peritonitis, for example, tuberculosis. This could mean the tubes were also affected.
- Menstrual history, for instance, whether menstruation is scanty or irregular. Any abortion or sicknesses should be noted.
- Outcomes of previous pregnancies should also be noted.
- Marital history, including duration of marriage and how long she has been trying to become pregnant.

The plan of action after taking down the patient's initial history and examination should include a Hysterosalpingography (HSG), which remains a useful investigation for tubal patency. A laparoscopy plus dye test does not only allow assessment of tubal patency but also gives proof that the tube is normal in appearance, the fimbriae are healthy and that the tubal movement is adequate.

Ovulation may be confirmed in several ways, including the temperature method, the examination of cervical mucous, progesterone level on blood sample taken one week before a period is expected (day 21 of 28 day cycle) and a level of more than $20 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, which confirms that ovulation has taken place. An ultrasound may detect follicular growth and ovulation. A histological examination of the endometrium should also be performed just before menstruation in order to assess the response to progesterone secretion by corpus luteum and to exclude tuberculosis.

\section*{Treatment of Infertility}

Not all couples that complain of infertility need to be investigated and treated. For short periods of infertility in a young couple, simple clinical assessment and reassurance that they appear normal is all that is required. Emphasise to the couple that if no abnormality is found, that pregnancy is always possible even after many years.

Treatment may take several forms. A detailed outline of ovulatory failure was covered earlier in section two. Tubal blockage can be treated by salpingolysis, which is the most successful tubal operation and consists of dividing peritubal adhesions around the ampullary ends of the tube.

Salpingotomy involves making an opening into the distal end of a hydrosalpinx and is usually better for fimbrial blockage. In tubal anastomosis, blockage, the isthmic portion is excised and the cut ends anastomosed.

During in vitro fertilisation, the oocytes from the mature ovarian follicle are retrieved, fertilised with the partner's sperm and the developing embryo is replaced into the woman's uterus.

In the male there are also various forms of fertility treatment, depending on the specific condition. Semen problems, such as azoospermia, secondary to lack of gonadotrophic stimulation, are curable by the administration of Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin (HMG). However, there is no treatment for azoospermia due to congenital anomalies or chromosomal abnormalities.

Synthetic androgens, for example, mesterolone (proviron), have a direct action on spermatogenesis. They should be administered at a dose of 50 mgs daily for three months.

Oligospermia will often respond to an improvement in the patient's general health and fitness, therefore, exercise and a good diet should be encouraged. The patient should also be advised to avoid excessive consumption of alcohol, tobacco and caffeine. Additionally, the excision of varicocele, if present, is commonly done for oligospermia.

Artificial Insemination (AIH) with the partner's semen is widely used for infertility due to impotence or anatomical abnormality in the male, especially in cases of hypospadias, which prevents normal ejaculation of sperm into the upper vagina.

You should also counsel the patient on general measures that may be helpful like refraining from excessive coitus, obtaining adequate sleep, weight-loss advice for obese patients and the need to avoid excessive and prolonged exposure of the scrotum to heat by avoiding hot bath, tight underwear or prolonged sitting in hot environments.

Some of the problems infertile couples may face will include:
- Poor social standing that is, not having respect from friends, relatives and the community as a whole.
- The stress of infertility makes one be unproductive economically.
- Sexual disinterest due to dyspareunia.

The frantic effort of wanting children will complicate the infertility leading to domestic disharmony, separation and divorces and/or promiscuity which may increase the risk of STI/HIV.

As you come to the end of this sub-section, you will now be able to identify couples with infertility and assist appropriately. You have covered the predisposing factors in both sexes and looked at the investigations and appropriate management.

\section*{Climacteric Crisis (1 of 7)}

In women climacteric crisis is the period of menopause (while in males it is known as andropause).

Menopause is a period in a woman's life when menstruation ceases naturally. There is progressive ovarian failure, which is preceded by complete absence of menstruation. Menopause is declared after one year of no menstruation. A considerable number of women will undergo physical or emotional upsets but the majority will not be significantly affected.

To some, menopause is a threatening period that declares the end of their femininity, while to others it is a time when many former diseases or ailments recur. A few will see this process as witchcraft or untreatable disease. You should note that sexual desire is present in most women for many years after menstruation ceases.

\section*{Climacteric Symptoms}

The climacteric symptoms occur as a syndrome. Menopausal syndrome refers to several symptoms related to hormonal imbalances in women. Menopause may occur without any symptoms other than the cessation of menstruation, but it is not infrequently associated with other symptoms. The most common of these is the occurrence of hot flushes.

A hot flush is the flushing of the face and neck often with sweating. The flush may be only momentary or may last up to 15 minutes and recur many times a day. The flush occurs as a result of a rise in the peripheral blood flow (measured in the arm) and in the pulse rate, but no change in blood pressure. About 80 to $85 \%$ of women experience hot flushes. In Kenya these are often mistaken for malaria or typhoid.

\section*{Remember:}

Flushes are particularly severe and abrupt when there is a change in the hormone balance, for example, after bilateral oophorectomy and, in men, after orchidectomy.

\section*{Climacteric Symptoms}

Other symptoms include weight gain in some women, which is generally a result of low-level activity. Exercise tends to promote hormonal balance. Osteoporosis can also result and has been attributed to oestrogen deficiency.

Atrophic changes in the vulva will cause discomfort and dyspareunia. A decrease in vaginal acidity may allow organisms to survive and lead to vaginitis or endometritis (this occurs in a small number of women). This may be confused for STIs.

\section*{Remember:}

Decrease in circulating oestrogen levels will lead to increased excretion of calcium in the urine. Calcium is essential in bone development.

Anxiety, irritability, insomnia and depression are often present in varying degrees and are seen mainly in women who have a history of psychological instability. Additionally, aches, pains, headaches, urinary urge and incontinence are often as a physical expression of anxiety and depression. Some women experience severe headaches for unexplained reasons.

Periods may cease abruptly or gradually diminish at the menopause. Although excessive and irregular blood loss is not uncommon at about the time of menopause, it must never be accepted as normal or 'just the change'.

\section*{Management of Menopause}

The majority of women soon adjust to their new situation. This is especially true if they get support and understanding from their husband and family. For some, their problems may be severe enough to warrant them seeking medical advice.

Oestrogen may be administered to suppress hot flushes and this may, in turn relieve sleeplessness and also help the depression. Some preparations that can be used include equine combined oestrogen (premarin) 0.62 mgs daily or oestrogen valerate (progynoval) 1 mg daily.

For atrophic changes in the genital tract, Dienestrol cream can be applied locally. Some doctors may give the treatment for several weeks to relieve symptoms, then gradually reduce the doses before discontinuing the treatment.

Long-term therapy (as long as ten years) may benefit the patient in preventing this condition, but on the other hand, may induce endometrial carcinoma or enhance the growth of pre-existing carcinoma of the breast. Therefore, it should be established as far as possible that no such tumour is present when this therapy is employed. Progesterone, if added, may prevent this.

Prophylaxis of osteoporosis is managed by increasing calcium intake. It is important for all women to know the importance of a balanced diet, especially plant foods, for example, fresh fruits and vegetables, which promote hormone production and especially soya beans, which have natural oestrogen.

The majority of middle aged or older women do not know what to expect at certain times in their later life, including the cessation of menstruation. Psychological counselling is often valuable and helps the patient understand the intricacies of the physiological changes that are taking place in her.

\section*{Section 6: Neoplastic Disorders}

\section*{Introduction}

This section looks at neoplastic disorders, (more commonly known as tumours). You may find that here these two terms will be used interchangeably. You need to have an idea of the underlying pathology of these tumours so that you can identify them early and decide whether referral to hospital is urgently needed or not. You will also look at neoplasms of the genital tract and the breast (the breast is an assessory organ of the reproductive system).

This unit covers the types of neoplasms, aetiological factors, and prevention in general and then go on to a more detailed discussion of how each organ is affected.

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of this section you will be able to:
- List two types of tumours
- State causative factors
- Describe the investigations carried out to rule out tumours
- Describe the management of various neoplasms of the reproductive organs

\section*{Tumours (1 of 6)}

There are two types of tumours:
- Benign, which are confined to a particular tissue. They include warts or multiple papillomata, fribroma and lipoma and endometriosis.
- Malignant, which tend to spread to other organs near and far, for example, carcinomas that affect the epithelial cells and sarcoma affecting the connective tissue.

\section*{Causes of Neoplasms}

The causes of neoplasms are not well known but they are associated with the following:
- Drugs, for example, thalidomide, a tranquilliser once widely used, causes deformities in new born babies as well as tumours.
- Radiation may lead to leukaemia (cancer of the blood).
- Toxins, for example, aflatoxin found in cereals and groundnuts may lead to carcinoma of the liver.
- Alcohol may lead to cirrhosis of the liver.
- Smoking is associated with cancer of the lungs.
- High parity women are reportedly prone to cancer of the cervix.
- Sexual activity, especially at an early age may also lead to cancer of the cervix.

\section*{Diagnosis}

The diagnosis is generally based on clinical suspicion, symptoms, signs and examination and a biopsy for histology.

\section*{Management}

The management of neoplasms follows the same general measures that you have been looking at throughout this unit. Can you remember them?

The first step is to take a detailed history. Your investigations should include routine laboratory data like haemoglobin, urea, blood group, urinalaysis and so on. You should also conduct an Examination Under Anesthesia (EUA) where a biopsy is taken to detect the type of cancer and staging.

Following this, treatment may take several forms. Surgery may be palliative in the late stages and in cases where the tumour mass is reduced. Radical surgery is performed in the early stages and involves the whole organ/system being removed. This procedure is sometimes curative.

Chemotherapy involves the administration of anti-cancer drugs. Radiotherapy is usually recommended in the advanced stage. More often, a combination of all the aforementioned treatments is used.

\section*{Prevention}

Can this condition be prevented? There are measures that women can take which would help to curb tumours in their early stages and control them. These include the following:
- A pelvic examination once a year.
- Breast examination (women can also be taught self-examination and are encouraged to perform this frequently).
- Pap smear tests for all women of reproductive age once every year. For a detailed explanation of the findings of the Pap smear test, refer to unit four. Remember that Class IV refers to obvious malignancy.

\section*{Remember:}

If Class III and IV are found in a woman of reproductive age, a cone biopsy is performed. If the woman is not of reproductive age then a sub-total abdominal hysterectomy is recommended Prevention

Continuing below are more measures that women can take which would help to curb tumours in their early stages and control them.
- Sonography, whereby a scan of the pelvic area attempts to identify ovarian tumours and uterine fibroids.
- Endometrial biopsy in post-menopausal bleeding after dilatation and curettage to detect cancer of endometrium.

Now move on to look at specific organs and see the type of tumours that affect them and how to manage them.

\section*{Types of Tumour and their Management (1 of 53)}

\section*{Tumours of the Vulva}

Genital cancers in women account for $5 \%$ of the reproductive organ cancers. The benign lesions (tumours) of the vulva include:
- Bartholin's cyst/abscess which is the most common.
- Granuloma lesions which arise as a reaction to germs due to condylomata lata in third stage tissue reaction, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis and/or condylomata acuminata due to viral warts.
- Very rarely carcinoma may arise in Bartholin's gland.

Another rare tumour of the vulva is basal cell carcinoma (rodent ulcer), which grows slowly and does not metastasise although it infiltrates locally.

The symptoms and signs that are diagnostic in neoplastic conditions of the vulva are:
- Ulcer or swelling, soreness or irritations are early signs.
- Slight bleeding may occur.
- Later, there is a purulent discharge, which becomes very offensive.
- Enlarged inguinal glands may breakdown and ulcerate and occasionally severe haemorrhage may occur from erosion of femoral vessels.
- Diagnosis is made by biopsy taken for histologic examination.

\section*{Prevention}

Early biopsy should be done in suspicious cases in women with leukoplakia and itching.

\section*{Prognosis}

The prognosis depends on the stage at which the condition is first diagnosed. It is usually worse when glands are involved. The size of the lesion affects the outcome. Lesions that are less than 2 cm in diameter have twice as good a prognosis as larger tumours. If the tumour is first detected when it is small, with no palpable glands, then it can be completely removed with the glands and the patient has a 75\% chance of surviving up to five years.

\section*{Treatment}

For cancer of the vulva, treatment will include examination under anaesthesia after which a biopsy is taken, and staging done. Surgery may involve the radical excision of the vulva and of the inguinal and femoral glands on both sides, especially if it is undertaken in the late stage.

Alternatively, an excision and biopsy may be done. Radiotherapy is performed on tumours at the fourchette because of involvement of the anal canal. This may be curative in the early stages.

\section*{Tumours of the Urethra}

A urethra carbuncle is a small, bright red swelling at the urethral orifice, usually occurring in menopausal women. Some carbuncles cause no symptoms but most are very tender, and may cause dyspareunia or pain on micturition. They are not neoplastic but probably result from chronic infection of the paraurethral glands in the floor of the urethra.

Treatment is by excision or destruction by diathermy. Carcinoma of the urethra is a rare tumour but if it occurs, it is usually a squamous cell carcinoma arising near the meatus. It may sometimes be an adenocarcinoma arising in the paraurethral glands.

\section*{Tumours of the Vagina}

The benign tumours here include condylomata acuminata, which are also known as venereal genital warts. This is caused by the human papilloma virus and is transmitted through genital contact.

The originally small papillary growths tend to coalesce and form large cauliflower-like masses, which proliferate profusely during pregnancy. The growths may aggregate into a large mass that may even block the introitus during late delivery. Secondary infection is common. These venereal warts usually regress markedly during puerperium and may even disappear. The virus does not affect the foetus.

\section*{Management}

The most effective drug is fluorouracil, recommended for use only during non-pregnant state because it is noxious to the foetus. The gravida with this condition should be treated by cryotherapy or excision of the lesions. Improved vaginal hygiene is also beneficial.

Fibromyoma is another benign tumour which may occasionally arise in the vaginal wall. It is hard and smooth and can easily be enucleated. Another possible tumour is endometriosis, a condition that has already been discussed in section two of this unit.

Carcinoma of the vagina is rare and, if it occurs, it is usually of the squamous type. Cancer of the cervix very commonly spreads to the vaginal vault. In the case of endometrial carcinoma, isolated vaginal metastases may occur.

Patients with cancer of the vagina complain of bleeding, especially after coitus and later, an offensive watery discharge. The growth may ulcerate forming a fistula into the rectum or vagina.

\section*{Treatment}

Treatment is often very unsatisfactory. Most cases are treated by local application of radium or caesium and external irradiation of the lymphatic glands of the pelvis. The only alternative treatment is extensive operation to remove the whole vagina, uterus and pelvic lymphatic glands. If the rectum is involved, it is also removed and colostomy established.

\section*{Tumours of the Cervix}

The benign tumours here are:
- Polyps
- Fibroids
- Nabothian follicles (which are often a result of infection)

The carcinomas include adenocarcinoma, which is common, and squamous, which is less common.

Carcinoma of the cervix is a common genital malignancy. It begins in the cervix at the margin of the external os where it stays for sometime before it begins to penetrate the neighbouring tissues. It extends outwards towards the pelvic wall, downwards into the vagina, backwards to the rectum and forwards to the bladder.

\section*{Signs and Symptoms}

The affected patient is likely to be between
30 to 40 years of age and the signs and symptoms may present with:
- Post-coital bleeding because the penis rubs on the ulcerated cervix.
- Post-menopausal bleeding. Any woman who resumes bleeding per vagina after menstruation had ceased should suspect the possibility of cancer of the cervix.
- Offensive purulent discharge per vagina will indicate infection of the necrotic surfaces of the tumour.
- Pain in the lower abdomen or back (this is a very late symptom).

Risk factors include:
- Early age (usually below 18 years) of first coitus.
- Multiple sexual partners.
- Viral infections like Herpes Simplex Type II.
- High parity, that is, above five children.
- Poor hygiene, whereby dirt collects in the vagina or in the foreskin of uncircumcised men.

\section*{Prevention}

As mentioned earlier, prevention includes educating women of a reproductive age to be aware of the signs and symptoms of the condition, which will enable them to seek early treatment. Also women should be encouraged to take the Papanicolaou test every year.

\section*{Management}

Initial diagnosis should follow these steps:
- Take the patient's history
- Physical examination
- Perform a biopsy
- In the early stage, a Pap smear test will help discover whether the condition is curable
- Examination Under Anaesthesia (EUA) in order to conduct the biopsy and do staging

After a diagnosis has been made, treatment should be given. Surgery involves radical hysterectomy in the early stages or may be necessary in combination with radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is either external (pelvis) or intracavity (caecium in the uterine cavity).

The prognosis is best in the early stages of the disease. Survival from the five year time frame and beyond is very poor. Complications of radiotherapy include relapses, ovarian failure, RVF and VVF.

\section*{Tumours of the Ovaries}

The ovary is the only organ in the body that is capable of producing many varieties of tumours. The majority of them are cystic and benign. Some are highly malignant and some produce oestrogen with symptoms of menorrhagia.

The cysts of the ovarian follicle or corpus luteum are:
- Follicular cysts symptoms vary from no symptoms to pain and/or haemorrhage - they may not be palpable however. Occasionally a follicular cyst may reach the size of a tennis ball and it may then cause discomfort and be palpable on vaginal examination.
- Lutein and theca lutein cysts are lined by cells of the corpus luteum type and may arise from either granulosa or theca. They look yellowish like the corpus luteum and the most common type is the corpus luteum cyst.
- Blood cysts whereby there is bleeding into the follicular cyst, a corpus luteum or a neoplasm in the ovary. If the blood has been shed for some time, it will be thicker and darker than normal blood. In this case the name of 'chocolate' or 'tarry' cyst is often given.

Benign ovarian neoplasms include:
- Mucinous cystadenoma, which is the most common of all ovarian neoplasms and can reach an enormous size and distend most of the abdomen. They can occur at any age but are rare before puberty.
- Serous cystadenoma is a common type of benign new growth. It has a smooth lining, which may be confused with a large follicular cyst at operation.
- Dermoid cyst or benign teratoma may contain almost any type of tissue derived from two or more of the primary germ layers, that is, endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. They are mixed together in an irregular pattern. A dermoid cyst may occur at any age but is most common during reproductive age and particularly between the ages of 20 and 30 years.

Malignant tumours of the ovary are the third most common tumours affecting the genital tract. The first is cancer of the uterus, followed by cancer of the cervix.

Ovarian cancer tends to spread quietly around the peritoneum of the pelvis and to the alimentary canal. It infiltrates the omentum, too, should that structure adhere to it. The prognosis is usually poor due to its silent nature. When the tumour spreads to other organs, there will be symptoms referable to them.

Complications of ovarian tumours in order of frequency include:
- Torsion, that is, the tumour can twist on its pedicle as long as it is not fixed to any surrounding structure. The patient complains of pain in the lower abdomen, which may start after sudden movement, or slow onset of pain. When the torsion is rapid, the pain is severe and patient may vomit repeatedly. On examination, the abdomen is tender but not rigid as in peritonitis. There is a firm tender lump, which is separated from the uterus on abdominal and bimanual examination.
- Rupture of the cyst may occur spontaneously. This is a serious matter and an immediate laparotomy should be done if the cyst is large and feels like it is going to rupture.
- Haemorrhage, especially small haemorrhages into the ovarian cyst, is common. Most of them seem to cause no symptoms but are only seen at laparostomy. Occasionally a
massive haemorrhage may take place in a cyst, particularly a malignant one and may cause pain similar to that of torsion.
- Infection is not very common but a cyst may be involved in any local inflammatory process such as appendicitis diverticulitis.

\section*{Management}

This may take several forms. If surgery is indicated, the surgeon may be faced with various possibilities. These include a cystectomy of either one ovary or bilateral ovary with removal of the opposite ovary or removal of ovaries, tubes and uterus. Surgery may, alternatively, involve the removal of as much malignant tissue as possible or the biopsy of an inoperable mass.

A cystectomy involves the shelling of the benign tumour out of its ovarian bed, leaving behind normal ovarian tissue, which will continue its function of ovulation and production of hormones.

\section*{Remember:}

Torsion and rupture of a cyst is an acute surgical emergency. The ovary and tube must be removed.

\section*{Tumours of the Uterus}

The benign tumour that is the most common growth in the uterus of women is the fibroid (fibromyoma). This tumour arises in the muscular wall of the uterus. Tumours vary in size from minute seedling growths to enormous masses, which occupy nearly the whole abdomen. They are often multiple.

Cancer of the uterus is also found in the endometrium and is usually adenocarcinoma of the body of the uterus and sarcoma.

\section*{Uterine Fibroids}

You will see in the illustration opposite that varieties of uterine fibroids are named depending on their location in the uterus.

The table below states the incidence of uterine fibroids.
\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\multicolumn{2}{c|}{ Incidence } \\

The different varieties of uterine fibroids include:

\section*{Interstitial}

Interstitial, which begin as small nodules in the myometrium. When they increase in size, they tend to extrude towards the peritoneal surface or into the uterine cavity. There is increased menstrual loss due to enlargement of the uterine body.

\section*{Subserous}

Subserous (subperitoneal) fibroids lie outside of the uterus and are covered with peritoneum. They are usually multiple, ranging from small nodules on the surface of the uterus to enormous masses weighing up to 20 kgs or more. They tend to grow up into the abdomen and may become pendunculated so that on bimanual examination, the tumour seems to be separated from the uterus and feel like an ovarian tumour.

\section*{Submucous}

Submucous (subendometrial) fibroids are near the endometrium or hang into the cavity in which case they form a polyp with a long pedicle. The stalk of the polyp contains a few blood vessels, which nourish it. The uterine cavity may contract and hence the cervix dilates and expels the polyp through it.

\section*{Cervical Fibroids}

Cervical fibroids are rare. Only $2 \%$ of uterine fibroids arise in the cervix. Usually it is a single tumour, although there may be other tumours in the body of the uterus. This type of tumour will cause distortion and elongation of the cervical canal and displace the body of uterus upwards. A large one may cause retention of urine.

The development of uterine fibroids is related to the action of oestrogen in a way not well understood. They arise during the period of menstrual activity although there are rarely symptoms before the age of 25 years.

The fibroids are more commonly found in nulliparous women or women who have not been pregnant for some time. They tend to occur three times more frequently in black women than in white women and occur at earlier age in the former. Reasons for this are not known.

\section*{Common Symptoms}

First of all, it is important to note that there may be no symptoms in a woman with uterine fibroids. The condition may simply be discovered during a routine examination. However, the following signs and symptoms may be apparent:
- An abdominal tumour is sometimes the first thing that the patient notices. It is not tender and rarely gives rise to pain, but occasionally causes local discomfort and a feeling of weight.
- Menorrhagia is a common reason for the patient to seek medical advice. Periods increase in amount and duration and may be accompanied by clots, but cycles are regular.
- Pain is not a common symptom but when it occurs, it is generally an indication that there is associated endometriosis or PID or some complications like torsion. There may be colicky pain while a fibryomatous polyp is being extruded through the cervix by uterine contractions.
- Frequency and retention of urine, especially with a large tumour pressing on the bladder.
- Affects child bearing, mostly because it tends to cause abortion. Also, submucous growth projecting into and distending the uterine cavity and interstitial tumours may obstruct labour.

Keep in mind that physical signs will vary with size, position and number of tumours and may include:
- Asymmetrical enlargement of the uterus, which is found with a submucous growth projecting into and distending the uterine cavity.
- The uterus feels harder than it does when the enlargement is due to pregnancy.
- Not tender on palpation, unless the tumour is undergoing red degeneration.
- Uterine soufflé (a soft blowing sound made by the blood within the arteries of the gravid uterus) similar to that of pregnancy, may occasionally be heard on auscultation.
- On pelvic examination the cervix may be found to be pushed down or displaced to one side.

Infertility is usually a common presenting problem when the fibroid is discovered during routine examination.

\section*{Management}

For small benign tumours that are not causing symptoms, no treatment is required but the patient should be re-examined regularly (every six to twelve months). If the tumour is found to be increasing in size, it should be treated. The patient and family (especially spouse) should be counselled on the effects of the tumour on menstruation, menopause and libido. Usually, such tumours cease to grow once menopause has been reached. At this point they grow slowly and seldom become malignant.

Surgical treatment is definitely indicated in case of heavy or prolonged bleeding caused by large tumours, even if they are not causing problems, and especially in young women because further growth is probable. It is also necessary in cases where there is possible malignant change, such as a tumour, which grows after the menopause, where the tumour leads to retention of urine or obstructs labour or if the tumour has undergone torsion.

An operation is necessary in the above conditions for the recovery or preservation of the patient's health. However, there are also other alternatives available. Myomectomy is the removal of the fibroid, where the uterus is retained. This is indicated when the woman wishes to keep her uterus and also in cases of infertility whereby no other cause of sterility can be found. Hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus with the fibroid. This procedure is indicated in patients who are 40 years of age and above.

Pre and post-operative care are the same as for any other major surgery.

\section*{Prognosis}

Surgical therapy is curative. Pregnancy is possible after multiple myomectomy. Premature menopause will not occur in a well-executed hysterectomy, where the ovaries are retained.

\section*{Carcinoma of the Uterus}

Common malignancies affecting the female are those of the breast and uterus. Sarcomas are rather uncommon uterine malignancies accounting for less than $2 \%$ of total malignancies. The causes of the condition are still unknown. It occurs most frequently in post-menopausal women.

You have taken a step-by-step approach to the explanation of benign and malignant tumours in each organ of the genital tract and touched on possible management techniques. These are not pleasant conditions since the prognosis is not always positive. Nevertheless, you will come across them and should be prepared to deal with them.

Now move on to look at carcinoma of the breast.

\section*{Carcinoma of the Breast}

The breast is the most common site of carcinoma in women aged 40 to 44 years of age and the leading cause of death. Most often, the general surgeon will handle growths or lesions in the breast. However, it is important for you to learn how these conditions present, associated risk factors and their management and follow up.

Some of the following factors are most commonly associated with increased risks of breast cancer. They include:
- Heredity, although the mechanism of inheritance is not clear. Studies have shown that women whose mothers or sisters have had cancer of the breast are two to three times more likely to develop the disease.
- Marital status and parity, where single and nulliparous women have a slightly higher incidence of breast cancer than married and parous women. Women with three or more children have a lower incidence than women with fewer children.
- Mammary dysplasia or cystic disease of the breast, particularly when accompanied by proliferative change, papillomatosis or solid hyperplasia is associated with increased incidence of cancer.
- A woman with cancer in one breast is at risk of developing cancer in the opposite breast.
- Women with cancer of the uterus and/or the ovary face an almost doubled risk of developing breast cancer when compared with the general population.
- Significant percentages of women with breast cancer may have abnormal hormonal environment.
- Oral contraceptives and menopausal oestrogen may produce proliferation of epithelial elements within the breast.

You will now look at the clinical findings. Usually a lump presents in the breast. Clinical evaluation begins with a complete history and physical examination. A biopsy is taken to confirm diagnosis. The extent (stage) is determined in order to avoid inappropriate measures like radical mastectomy in a patient with distant metastases.

The following steps should be taken during clinical evaluation:
- Take a thorough medical history.
- Take special note of menarche, pregnancies, last menstrual period, previous breast lesions and family history of breast cancer.
- Presenting complaints in which you will find that $80 \%$ of cases will have a painless lump, and in $90 \%$ of cases, the lump will have been discovered by the patient herself.
- Breast examination (see unit one of this module) should be meticulous, methodical and gentle. Examine the breast size and contour, minimal nipple retraction, slight oedema, redness and retraction of skin.
- Breast cancer usually consists of a non-tender firm or hard lump with poorly delimited margins.
- Slight nipple or skin retraction is an important sign.
- Very small erosion (one to two millimetres) of the nipple epithelium may be the only manifestation of cancer.
- Watery, serous or bloody discharge from the nipple is an occasional early sign.

\section*{Diagnosis}

Before treatment is commenced, a definite diagnosis has to be made through laboratory tests, which will include:
- Blood test for sedimentation rate (which will be raised as a result of a disseminated cancer), alkaline phosphates (when raised is associated with liver metastases) and hypercalcaemia (occasionally an important finding in advanced malignancy of the breast) as well as a complete blood count.
- Urinalysis.

An x-ray should be taken to determine the frequency of metastases to the lungs. A CT scan will help to locate metastases to the bones, brain, etc.
A biopsy should be performed where tissue is removed from the lesion and examined.
A cytology examination of nipple discharge or cyst or the breast is also recommended as well as a mammogram, which is a soft tissue radiological examination of the breast.

\section*{Remember:}

Treatment should never be undertaken without an unequivocal histological diagnosis of cancer. The safest course is to take biopsy of all suspicious masses found on physical examination.

The two methods used to perform breast biopsy are:
- Needle biopsy, which is the simplest. It involves either the aspiration of tumour cells or obtaining a small core of tissue with special needle (this is an office procedure).
- Open biopsy, which is the most widely used. It is performed under general anaesthesia. When a needle biopsy is negative it should be confirmed by open method.

\section*{Management of Breast Cancer}

The treatment may be curative or palliative according to clinical stage I, II, III disease. Palliative treatment by radiation, hormones, chemotherapy or a combination of methods is recommended for patients in stage IV of the disease (distant metastases) and for previously treated patients who have developed distant metastases or ineradicable local recurrences.

\section*{Radical Mastectomy}

This involves en bloc removal of the breast, pectoral muscles and axillary nodes. It has been a standard curative procedure for breast cancer since the turn of the last century.

\section*{Remember:}

This operation is contra-indicated in cancer that has spread to sub-clavicular nodes or to more distant sites because it will not cure the condition.

\section*{Extended Radical Mastectomy}

This involves the removal of the internal mammary nodes in addition to standard radical mastectomy.

\section*{Modified Radical Mastectomy}

This involves en bloc removal of the breast and preservation of the pectoralis major muscles. The advantages of this operation are that it is cosmetic and functional in that the preservation of the pectoralis major muscles avoids a hollow beneath the clavicle hence preventing shoulder dysfunction and oedema of the arm.

\section*{Simple Mastectomy}

This is done if the malignancy is confined to the breast without spread to adjacent muscles or to the regional nodes or beyond.

\section*{Local Excision/Lumpectomy}

This is also known as a partial mastectomy and provides definitive treatment for early breast cancer, especially for a small Stage I lesion.

\section*{Radiotherapy}

This method is used for the treatment of certain breast cancers, particularly those that are locally advanced or in cases where the patient refuses a mastectomy.

The procedure can be used in conjunction with radical mastectomy as a pre-operative or postoperative course of action in order to reduce the incidence of local recurrence from residual cancer in the operative field. The process destroys metastatic cancer in the internal mammary and sub-clavicular lymph nodes. Therefore, the patient should be selected for radiotherapy based on the likelihood of local recurrence of the existence of disease in unresected regional nodes.

\section*{Chemotherapy}

This process can be used in conjunction with radical mastectomy, especially in patients found to have positive axillary nodes.

Mortality and morbidity rates following radical mastectomy are low and the procedure is generally well tolerated even by elderly patients. However, you should note that there are several complications associated with breast cancer.

There are occasionally wound complications like haematoma or serum collection under the skin flaps and necrosis of the skin margins may occur but this can be easily managed. The most serious complications may include:
- Local recurrences of cancer within operative field. This signals the presence of a spread.
- Oedema of the arm. When this appears in the early post-operative period, it is usually caused by lymphatic obstruction. Infection in the axilla may also be a cause of the oedema. This is because the lymphatic drainage of the arm is compromised and the extremity becomes more than normally susceptible to infection following minor injuries.

Chronic oedema should be managed by elevation and by a snugly fitted elastic sleeve, which is slipped over the arm from hand to shoulder. The patient should receive pre and post-operative nursing care in the same way as other surgical patients.

This patient will need long-term care. A periodic
re-examination is done to detect recurrences and to observe the opposite breast for second carcinoma. The examination is conducted every six months until a period of five years postoperatively has elapsed. It is then carried out every six to twelve months thereafter for life.

The patient should also be advised on the importance of self-breast examination monthly, especially after menstruation. A mammogram should be obtained annually.

In order to facilitate rehabilitation after breast reconstruction, the patient should be advised on the active exercise of the shoulder and arm on the affected side, which should begin early in the post-operative period. The patient should have been counselled before surgery to enable her to adjust to the cosmetic defect. Before leaving the hospital, she should receive information on where to obtain prosthesis to wear in her brassiere.

The patient should also be informed that, theoretically, high levels of oestrogen produced by the placenta as the pregnancy progresses can be detrimental to the patient with occult metastases of oestrogen sensitive breast cancer.

\section*{Prognosis}

For cancer confined to the breast the five year clinical cure rate by radical mastectomy is 75 to $90 \%$. When axial nodes are involved, the rate drops to 40 to $60 \%$ at five years. Ten years after the radical mastectomy the overall clinical cure rate is only about $25 \%$ in this group of patients. Breast cancer tends to be more malignant in young women than in old women.

Lastly, you will look at the benign growths of the breast.

\section*{Mammary Dysplasia}

This disorder is also known as chronic cystic mastitis of the breast. It is common in women of 30 to 50 years of age, but rare in postmenopausal women. This suggests that it is related to ovarian activity. The oestrogen hormone is considered an aetiologic factor.

Clinical findings include:
- Asymptomatic lump, discovered accidentally in the breast.
- There may be nipple discharge.
- Discomfort occurs or increases during the pre-menstrual phase of the cycle at which period the cyst tends to increase in size.
- Fluctuation in size and rapid appearance or disappearance of a breast tumour is a common feature.
- Many patients will give a history of transient lump in the breast or cyclic breast pain.

\section*{Remember:}

If skin retraction is present, the diagnosis of cancer should be assumed until it is disproved by biopsy.

Before any treatment is commenced, a biopsy should be done to check for any suspicious lesion. For small, localised cysts, an excision should be carried out after cancer has been ruled out.

If the diagnosis is certain from a previous biopsy, then aspiration of a discrete mass is done. If a cyst is present, typicaly watery fluid, which may be straw-coloured, grey, greenish, brown or black, can be easily evacuated and the mass disappears. A cytology examination of the fluid is indicated.

The patient should be re-examined at intervals of two to four weeks for three months and every six to twelve months thereafter for life.

Breast pain, associated with generalised mammary dyspalsia, is best treated by avoidance of trauma and by wearing a brassiere (day and night), which gives good support and protection.

\section*{Prognosis}

You may find that symptoms of pain, tenderness and cyst formation will occur at any time until menopause, when they subside. The risk of breast cancer is usually about twice that of a woman in the general population. Therefore, the woman should be advised to:
- Examine her own breasts each month just after menstruation
- Inform the doctor if mass appears
- Attend clinic appointments regularly

Another benign growth you are going to look at briefly is fibro adenoma of the breast.

\section*{Fibro Adenoma of the Breast}

This is a common benign neoplasm occurring in young women usually within twenty years after puberty. It frequently tends to occur at an earlier age in black women than in white women. Multiple tumours in one or both breasts are found in 10 to $15 \%$ of patients.

The typical fibroadenoma is a round, firm, discrete, relatively movable, non-tender mass of one to five centimetres in diameter. The tumour is usually discovered accidentally. Clinical diagnosis in young patients is generally not difficult. For women over 30 years of age, cancer of the breast must be considered.

A fibroadenoma does not usually occur after the menopause but post-menopause women may develop it after the administration of oestrogenic hormone.

The treatment here is excision and pathologic examination to rule out any cancerous lesions.
Lastly you may remember when looking at abortion, two conditions had been left until the end of this unit. These were hydatid form mole and chorion carcinoma.

\section*{Hydatid Form Mole}

This is also referred to as molar pregnancy. It is an abnormal pregnancy resulting from a pathologic ovum with proliferation of the epithelial covering of the chorionic villi and dissolution and cysts cavitation of the vascular stroma of the villi. It results in a mass of cysts
resembling a bunch
of grapes.
Hydatid form change in placenta is a form of trophoblastic neoplasia, which may lead to frankly malignant proliferation of trophoblast cell known as choriocarcinoma. Histologically, to the naked eye, the mole may look like a bunch of whitish grapes, often interspersed with a blood clot (see the illustration opposite).

The hydatid form mole can be classified into two:
- Complete Mole, which shows total hydatid form change with no evidence of foetal circulation. They are more likely to develop malignant change.
- Partial mole, which is associated with foetus (even if the only evidence is traces of a microscopic foetal circulation). They are less likely to develop malignant change.

Now move on to look at the aetiological factors of this condition.
Some of the aetiological factors associated with hydatid mole include maternal age and high parity and malnutrition.

\section*{Maternal Age}

It is common in women under the age of 20 years and over 45 years in whom congenital abnormalities are most likely to be found.

\section*{High Parity and Malnutrition}

Although there is no evidence, these factors are associated in every society with congenital abnormalities.

Before they are enumerated it is important to mention that this condition is often not suspected because it is uncommon. Therefore, you should remember to rule it out in cases of threatened abortion and hyperemesis gravidarum. Did you think of the following clinical features?
- Bleeding is common, with a minor degree of intravascular coagulation. This is sometimes accompanied by a watery discharge and occasionally contains vesicles.
- Hyperemesis, which is probably due to an increase in HCG secretion, although this is not the cause in hyperemesis in normal pregnancy.
- Pallor and dyspnoea due to anaemia, which is often greater than expected.
- Anxiety and tremors because of HCG, which is glycoprotein similar to TSH, and has weak thyroid stimulating properties.
- High levels of HCG after 12 weeks of gestation.
- Amenorrhoea and pregnancy test is positive.
- Uterine enlargement where, in most cases, the uterus is larger than expected at 14 weeks of gestation. The uterine size may be normal after detachment of the mole.
- Absent foetal heart. Very rarely a mole and a foetus will co-exist.
- Absent foetal parts on palpation.
- The uterus has a 'doughy' feel.
- Signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia at 16 weeks are strongly suggestive of a mole (see unit two).
- Proteinuria.
- Vesicles passed per vagina.

\section*{Investigation}

Investigations will include a urinary essay of HCG and an ultrasound, which is highly diagnostic, especially if the mole is sufficiently developed.

\section*{Remember:}

Once a hydatid mole is diagnosed, the uterus should be evacuated. Management

Evacuation is not without risks. Before evacuation, the main risks are the possibility of haemorrhage. There is also the risk of trophoblastic invasion and perforation of the myometrium and/or dissemination of possibly malignant cells.

During evacuation, the main risks include haemorrhage, perforation by instrument and dissemination of possibly malignant cells.

Therefore, in order to ensure the immediate safety of the patient, the following measures may be included in the management. The uterus should be completely emptied by suction after spontaneous abortion. Additionally, an attempt should be made to empty the uterus by suction if spontaneous abortion does not occur. This is usually feasible up to about 14 weeks.

\section*{Remember:}

Oxytocin must be given if bleeding becomes severe. On rare occasions, an emergency hysterectomy may be unavoidable.

If the mother has passed the 16-week mark, abortion should be induced using prostaglandin and oxytocin.

Rapid evacuation of a large uterus has been known to cause disseminated intravascular coagulation and fatal shock. You should give blood transfusions to treat anaemia. Take a serial pregnancy test and chest x-rays.

In the case of an older woman, who does not wish to have any more children, a complete hysterectomy is justified, especially for the sake of clamping the uterine vessels to prevent the dissemination of trophoblast cells.

When following up, you should ensure the following:
- Family planning methods should be used for one year to prevent immediate pregnancy.
- A pregnancy test should be carried out every month for one year if titres are low and negative. After this, the patient is clear. However, if titres are increased, then suspect choriocarcinoma.
- Chemotherapy is indicated when there is high HCG in serum after six months or detectable HCG in serum after six months.
- Chest x-rays should be taken monthly until titres are negative and then every two months for one year.

\section*{Prognosis}

Close follow-up and early chemotherapy should result in a cure rate of almost $100 \%$ in patients with hydatid form mole. However, you should note that complications, including choriocarcinoma and early metastases to the lungs are possible.

Now move on to look at cancer of the placenta (choriocarcinoma).

\section*{Choriocarcinoma}

Choriocarcinoma is cancer of the placenta and it is very common in East Asia. $50 \%$ of cases will occur after a hydatid form mole, $25 \%$ after abortion, and $25 \%$ at interval (pregnancy). The prognosis is very poor as it does not often respond to treatment and many patients will die.

Signs and symptoms are similar to those associated with hydatid form mole, however, metastatic lesions are also present.

Once diagnosed, chemotherapy is immediately indicated.
This will include:
- Methotraxate, a cytotoxic drug, which is the principle drug.
- Combined therapy, that is, the use of multi-drug chemotherapy, especially when methotraxate appears to be ineffective.

The choice of drug depends on the patient. After chemotherapy, the patient is advised to delay conception for a year to give time to the damaged ova to be shed. This is primarily because methotraxate can be retained in the body for up to eight months and it may have damaged the oocytes resulting in the possibility of increased incidences of foetal abnormalities.

This brings you to the end of this section on neoplastic disorders and to the end of this unit.
