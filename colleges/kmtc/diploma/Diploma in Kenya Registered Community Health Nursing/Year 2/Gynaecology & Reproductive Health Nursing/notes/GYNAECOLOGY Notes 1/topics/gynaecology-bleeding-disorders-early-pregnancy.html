                        <p>In this section you will look at bleeding disorders in pregnancy. These conditions are usually on the borderline between obstetrics and gynaecology, in the sense that they involve women whose pregnancy comes to a premature end. You will find that these patients are always treated in a gynaecological ward rather than in the maternity ward.</p>
                        <p>For the purposes of this unit, bleeding in pregnancy refers to any bleeding per vagina. This bleeding, however slight, should be taken seriously. It is sometimes the first sign of some of the most life-threatening emergencies in obstetrics such as ruptured ectopic, and incomplete abortion. You will look at the possible causes of bleeding per vagina during pregnancy, how each case presents, and how it should be managed. The procedure known as Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA) as part of post-abortal care will also be covered.</p>
                        <p>It is important for you to note that bleeding per vagina during pregnancy is a cause for concern to most mothers. This is particularly so in a mother who has had a previous experience of vaginal bleeding which resulted in foetal loss. You must, therefore, be aware of the mother's emotional situation when caring for her during the antepartum period.</p>

                        <p>Vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy refers to any bleeding per vagina that occurs before the 28th week of pregnancy. In the early months of pregnancy, bleeding may be due to a number of factors or conditions.</p>

                        <p>As you may know, the most common cause of bleeding in early pregnancy is abortion. Abortion accounts for 95% of all bleeding in early pregnancy, whilst all the others account for only 5%. The last two, that is hydatidiform mole and chorion carcinoma will be discussed in the last section of this unit.</p>

                        <p><dfn id="abortion">Abortion</dfn> is defined as the loss or expulsion of the foetus before the 20th week of pregnancy. Abortion is significant not only because of the loss of a wanted pregnancy, but because it is a major cause of maternal death from the haemorrhage and sepsis that may follow a mismanaged abortion.</p>
                        <p>The definition of abortion generally accepted for legal purposes is 'the delivery of a foetus at less than 20 weeks gestation or with foetal weight of less than 500 gm'.</p>
                        <p>Many people tend to look upon abortion as pregnancy that has been terminated criminally and miscarriage as a spontaneous occurrence. As a result, abortion is stigmatised, however, the two are the same thing.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The causes of abortion are many and are divided into maternal, foetal and miscellaneous causes.</p>
                            <p>Maternal causes of abortion account for about 25% of the known cases of abortions and they include the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>General diseases like hypertension or chronic heart disease.</li>
                                <li>Acute febrile illnesses, for example, malaria, acute pyelonephritis, pneumonia.</li>
                                <li>Endocrine disorders, for example, thyrotoxicosis, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.</li>
                                <li>Local conditions such as under development of the uterus, fibroids and congenital abnormalities of the uterus. The fibroids can cause abortions, especially if they are submucous or deeply intramural. The congenital abnormalities of the uterus include a septate uterus and a bicornuate (uterus divided into two) uterus.</li>
                                <li>Cervical incompetence which may be due to either congenital weakness of the circular muscle fibres of the cervix, or previous splitting of the cervical sphincter due to obstetrical trauma, or high amputation of the cervix due to cervical lesions.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Foetal causes of abortion account for about 75% of the known cases and they often result in early abortion, that is, first trimester abortions. Foetal causes may be due to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Chromosomal or genetic abnormalities.</li>
                                <li>Abnormal attachment of the placenta, that is, defective implantation or activity of the trophoblast.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In addition to maternal and foetal causes, there are those that are grouped as miscellaneous causes. These include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Accidents, for example, falls, and injuries. The incidence of abortion among these cases varies enormously from individual to individual after the accidents.</li>
                                <li>Criminal interference, using various instruments, local herbs and plastic catheters, which are inserted into the cervical canal.</li>
                                <li>An Intrauterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD). An abortion, especially in the second trimester can occur if conception occurs despite the presence of an IUCD. Note that ectopic pregnancy, antepartum haemorrhage, premature rupture of the membranes and manual removal of the placenta occurs more commonly in pregnancy with an IUCD. Therefore, the IUCD should be removed as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Most of these abortions occur in the first three months of the pregnancy, before the placenta is mature. Abortion is the detachment of the products of conception, which is accompanied by bleeding that may be profuse. Blood loss is accompanied by painful contractions of the uterus, dilation of the cervix and expulsion of the foetus and its membranes. Slight or even moderate bleeding does not, however, mean that the foetus is no longer alive. As a health worker you must do all you can to save life at all times.</p>

                            <p>The patient with threatened abortion will have slight vaginal bleeding and abdominal discomfort. When you examine her you will find the os of the cervix closed.</p>
                            <p>While many patients will successfully carry this type of pregnancy to term, others may not. It is essential, therefore, to make the patient realise that nothing can be done to prevent an abortion.</p>

                                <li>Reassure the patient that, if she continues with the pregnancy, the foetus will not be at greater risk of abnormalities and that it will continue to grow just like in a normal pregnancy.</li>
                                <li>Ensure bed rest and allay anxiety (of losing the pregnancy) by administering tabs. Phenobarbitone 30 to 60 mgs tds, morphine 10 mgs or pethidine 100 mgs . If the pain is stronger, some doctors may use progesterone.</li>
                                <li>Warn the patient to notify the medical team if the cramps become worse or the bleeding becomes heavy.</li>
                                <li>Ask her to save the pads as well as any tissue or clots that she might expel, for examination.</li>
                                <li>Advise her to take a low residue diet and avoid aperients and enema because this will stimulate the contractions.</li>
                                <li>Advise her to remain in bed for at least three days after the bleeding stops.</li>
                                <li>Advise her to avoid heavy physical activities and especially sexual excitement.</li>

                            <p>Inevitable or imminent abortion means that nothing else can be done. The foetus must come out. The abortion becomes inevitable if, in addition to vaginal bleeding and abdominal discomfort, the uterine contractions become strong and painful and lead to dilatation of the cervix. This is followed by either complete abortion or incomplete abortion.</p>
                            <p>The primary measure taken is to save the life of the patient since there is often profuse bleeding, especially in patients who end up with an incomplete abortion. Take the patient's history to determine if the products of conception have been expelled.</p>

                            <p>Many patients will come to the hospital due to severe bleeding, which means that the products of conception have been retained.

                            <p>If the patient has excessive blood loss, hasten the evacuation by administering an oxytocic drug. Bleeding that does not cease after the expulsion of the products of conception will require administration of ergometrine 0.5 mg stat.</p>

                            <p>This means that the products of conception are not expelled despite the signs and symptoms of abortion.

                            <p>After some time (about eight weeks) a brownish discharge from the vagina appears. This shows that the foetus is dead but still in the uterus.

                            <p>In the past, this type of abortion was associated with the criminal interference of a pregnancy. However, it may occur in a spontaneous abortion, if there has been bacterial contamination. Septic abortion is usually caused by gram-negative Escherichia Coli (E. Coli) but sometimes gram-positive streptococci and staphylococci are also involved. In most cases, the infection is mild and limited to the uterus.</p>
                            <p>The infection may be limited to the tubes or it may spread to the peritoneal cavity and cause peritonitis. Severe E. Coli infection may lead to septicaemic shock due to endotoxins released by the organism, thus leading to total vascular collapse (death).</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Induced abortion is an abortion that is intentionally caused. It is commonly associated with young unmarried women, especially schoolgirls or even married women who get pregnant due to contraceptive failure. However, an induced abortion can also be performed for medical reasons.</p>
                            <p>There are two types of induced abortion: Therapeutic (which is performed on medical grounds) and Criminal (which is illegal).</p>
                            <p>According to medical ethics, a therapeutic abortion may be carried out only if two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion that the pregnancy should be terminated. There are two specific circumstances when this can be done. These are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If the continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of injury to her physical or mental health.</li>
                                <li>If there is a substantial risk that the child, when born, would suffer from physical or mental abnormalities and be seriously handicapped.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Criminal abortions are sometimes attempted by an unqualified person. The operation is often hurried and lacking asepsis. The complications of criminal abortions include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Haemorrhage.</li>
                                <li>Sepsis, which is usually severe and can lead to septicaemia and endotoxin shock.</li>
                                <li>Haemolysis and renal damage may occur secondary to the septicaemia.</li>
                                <li>Injuries to the birth canal and pelvic organs.</li>
                                <li>Sudden death due to extreme syncope as a result of dilatation of the cervix and in some cases from amniotic embolism.</li>

                        <p>The most common type of ectopic pregnancy is the tubal pregnancy, occurring in at least 55% of ectopic pregnancies. This type of pregnancy is common in the tropics because of the high incidence of blocked tubes due to gonorrhoea, puerperal and post abortal sepsis, and Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases (PIDs).</p>
                        <p>The ovum is fertilised in the fallopian tube but the zygote is unable to reach the uterine cavity because of loss of mobility and ciliary action. Therefore, the ovum may be arrested at:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The fimbriated end of the tube, which is an uncommon site.</li>
                            <li>The ampulla which is the most common site.</li>
                            <li>The isthmus which is the most dangerous site because of the frequency of tubal rupture at about four to five weeks.</li>
                            <li>The interstitial part of the tube in which rupture begins at second trimester. It is also an uncommon site.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>

                        <p>In many African countries, including Kenya, ruptured tubal pregnancy is the most common surgical emergency in women. Consequently, it is very important that you know how this condition presents and how it is managed.</p>
                        <p>From the description of the types of ectopic pregnancies you can now easily identify their causes.</p>
                        <p>Some of the common causes of ectopic pregnancy include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Previous inflammatory process in the tube or acute PID, which will heal with scarring tissue and block the tube.</li>
                            <li>Peritoneal adhesions secondary to previous surgery due to, for example, appendicitis, may cause occlusion.</li>
                            <li>Endometriosis whereby the endometrial tissue is lodged in the tube and occludes the tubal lumen.</li>
                            <li>Congenital anatomical irregularity often due to presence of diverticula of the uterine tube.</li>
                            <li>Tubal surgery.</li>

                            <p>Once the implantation has occurred in the tube, the sequence of events associated with pregnancy follows. The corpus luteum remains and grows, producing progesterone, which increases the thickness of the endometrium and ensures that it is not shed, so that the patient misses the period.</p>
                            <p>The tube is not, however, able to nourish the ovum for long and bleeding detaches the ovum. The ovum may be ejected into the peritoneal cavity through the fimbriated end. The onset of pain may be gradual or it may occur dramatically.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Unfortunately, an ectopic pregnancy causes very few symptoms until the foetus has become large enough to rupture the fallopian tube. This, therefore, makes it very difficult to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy before it ruptures. That is why it is very important that you refer a patient to hospital on the slightest suspicion of ectopic pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>The muscle wall of the tube does not have the capacity of the uterine muscle for hypertrophy and distension and tubal pregnancies nearly always end in rupture and the death of the ovum.</p>
                            
                            <h5>Before Rupture</h5>
                            <p>You should suspect an ectopic pregnancy before rupture if a woman comes to you with the following complaints:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Amenorrhoea of two or three months (common in about 80% of cases). The patient may sometimes present with a ruptured ectopic even before the expected date of the next period.</li>
                                <li>Vague lower abdominal pain, which the patient might ignore. This is due to slight leakage of blood from the tube, which causes localised peritoneal irritation. It may also be due to the distension of the tube by the growing foetus.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>On examination the patient is usually healthy. You might feel a slightly enlarged uterus or a mass on one side of the uterus.</p>

                            <h5>After Rupture</h5>
                            <p>When the tubal pregnancy ruptures, usually after two to three months, the patient presents with the following complaints. For the acute type of rupture, also known as fulminating, they complain of:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Sudden onset of low abdominal pain.</li>
                                <li>Vomiting and fainting because of the sudden intraperitoneal bleeding.</li>
                                <li>Vaginal bleeding, this may not develop until many hours after the rupture.</li>
                                <li>If bleeding is rapid it may lead to hypotension and shock.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>For the chronic leaking type, the patient complains of:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Suffering for some time from abdominal uneasiness.</li>
                                <li>Pain.</li>
                                <li>Occasional fainting.</li>
                                <li>Haemorrhagic slight bleeding.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The chronic rupture is the most common type of rupture of tubal pregnancy that you are likely to encounter. Unfortunately, in many cases, whenever health workers talk about an ectopic pregnancy, they only think of the acute type, that is a woman who develops sudden severe abdominal pain and collapses.</p>
                            <p>You must remember that not all ectopic pregnancies present in the acute type. In fact, in clinical practice, some of these patients have been wrongly managed as either threatened abortion or acute pelvic inflammatory disease. That is why an ectopic pregnancy has been called 'the great deceiver'.</p>

                            <p>A woman with acute ectopic pregnancy may present as discussed earlier with the following:</p>

                                <li>Sudden onset of lower abdominal pain.</li>

                                <li>The patient is in agonising pain and is restless.</li>
                                <li>She is sweating, yet her skin feels cold and her palms are wet.</li>
                                <li>She yawns frequently as if hungry for air.</li>
                                <li>The radial pulse is rapid, weak and thready. The blood pressure may be very low or unrecordable.</li>
                                <li>The temperature is usually normal.</li>
                                <li>The abdomen is very tender with muscle guarding. Signs of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity, such as a fluid thrill and shifting dullness, might be detected if the patient can tolerate the examination. However, the absence of these signs does not mean that there is no free blood in the peritoneal cavity as the blood might be in small amounts.</li>
                                <li>A pelvic examination is very painful and it is difficult to palpate the organs properly so it is important that you remember to be very gentle.</li>
                                <li>There is extreme pain on moving the cervix with the examining fingers, that is, the cervix is excitable.</li>
                                <li>The uterus is often slightly enlarged and a tender mass might be felt on one side of the uterus.</li>
                                <li>A tender mass may also be palpated in the pouch of Douglas if blood is clotted there. This is also known as pelvic haematocele.</li>
                                <li>The patient is usually anaemic.</li>

                            <p>In this type of pregnancy, it is very important to note the clinical history of the patient. You should check for the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Abdominal pain and uneasiness, where the pain is generally situated low down in the abdomen and, often, is more marked on one side. It is continuous and is not relieved by pressure, as is the case in intestinal colic. Sometimes the act of emptying the bladder initiates a bout of pain. In a few cases the patient complains of a frequent inclination to go and pass stool.</li>
                                <li>Amenorrhoea is usually present, with irregular vaginal bleeding, which is usually slight and often dark brown in colour. It is not uncommon to attribute this discharge to threatened abortion.</li>
                                <li>Occasionally there is expulsion of a decidual cast, especially if the pregnancy has gone beyond two months. The patient will give you an impression that she had a miscarriage. In some cases the health worker may carry out an evacuation thinking the patient has experienced an incomplete abortion.</li>
                                <li>Occasionally there is a feeling of nausea, vomiting and fainting attacks. Remember that sudden faintness is a characteristic symptom of ectopic gestation.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>When you examine the patient you are likely to find the following signs:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Anaemia of variable degrees.</li>
                                <li>Rapid pulse.</li>
                                <li>Normal or low blood pressure.</li>
                                <li>General tenderness and guarding in the lower abdomen, which is more marked on one side.</li>
                                <li>There may be a tender, firm mass in one of the iliac fossae.</li>
                                <li>On vaginal examination you will feel a tender mass in one of the fornices.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <h4 id="s3-heading-mgmt-ectopic-preg" class="subsubsection-heading">Management of Ectopic Pregnancy</h4>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>A patient with tubal pregnancy will require an emergency operation. The patient should be immediately referred to a hospital. Start an intravenous drip of normal saline before transferring the patient. During the transfer, ensure that you treat the patient for shock and administer analgesics like morphine or pethidine for the pain. Potential blood donors should accompany the patient to hospital where possible.</p>
                            <p>In the hospital, the following diagnostic tests may be performed:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ultrasonography.</li>
                                <li>Culdocentesis whereby non-clotting blood will be aspirated from the cul-de-sac.</li>
                                <li>Human Chorionic Gonadorophin (HCG), which involves urine testing.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Blood is taken for grouping and cross-matching and a blood transfusion is started. An emergency laparatomy is then performed to ligate the bleeders. The affected tube is usually removed by salpingectomy or salpingotomy, which involves making an opening in the tube.</p>
                            <p>It may be possible to give an auto-transfusion to a patient with a fresh rupture of a tubal pregnancy. Auto-transfusion involves scooping blood from the opened abdomen with a small gallipot and pouring it through a filter made of three or four layers of gauze into a sterile bowel or jug containing sodium acid citrate solution, which is an anti-coagulant. When 500 ml of blood have been collected it is decanted into a sterile bottle, which is then set up on a drip that is already running. Sometimes the blood is aspirated directly from the peritoneal cavity into a plastic transfusion bag containing sodium citrate solution.</p>
                            <p>Auto-transfusion is not advisable if:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The history of the patient suggests that heavy bleeding began more than 24 hours before the operation.</li>
                                <li>The blood appears discoloured or haemolysed.</li>
                                <li>There is an offensive odour when the abdomen is opened.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The advantages of auto-transfusion include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>No risk of transmitting HIV.</li>
                                <li>Blood is easily available and perfectly compatible.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>However serious the patient's condition appears to be, this operation has an excellent success rate. Post-operatively, the patient should be managed in the same manner as for any other abdominal operation.</p>
                            <p>After surgical treatment, there are several potential outcomes.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Another tubal pregnancy will occur in about 10% of the cases treated.</li>
                                <li>Infertility develops in approximately half of the patients who have undergone surgery for the treatment of an ectopic pregnancy. Of these about 30% become sterile.</li>
                                <li>Normal pregnancies are achieved in about half of patients who have one ectopic pregnancy.</li>
                            </ul>
