                        <p>Most normal couples achieve a pregnancy within a few months of trying. However, failure to do so after one year may be arbitrarily defined as infertility, provided that normal intercourse is taking place not less than twice a week. But what is the difference between infertility and sterility?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><dfn id="infertility">Infertility</dfn> is 'the inability to achieve a pregnancy or to carry a pregnancy to term after one year of unprotected intercourse'.</li>
                            <li><dfn id="sterility">Sterility</dfn> is 'the inability to produce offspring, i.e. the inability to conceive (female sterility) or to induce conception (male sterility)'.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are two types of infertility; primary and secondary. In primary infertility, no conception has taken place at all. In secondary infertility, there may have been some conception even if it ended in a spontaneous abortion.</p>
                        <p>There are several causes of infertility, which will be covered here under three broad categories general factors, female factors and male factors.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Age</h4>
                            <p>In the female conception occurs at any time after menarche and before menopause. It is rare in the first few cycles and the last few cycles before menopause because the cycles are usually anovular.</p>
                            <p>Fertility in women is at its height in the late teens and early twenties. It declines slowly after 30 years of age. In the male, spermatogenesis commences actively at puberty and continues throughout life but ageing reduces fertility to a variable extent.</p>

                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Health and Nutrition</h4>
                            <p>Good health is associated with fertility but bad health is not an absolute barrier to conception, except when ovulation and spermatogenesis are directly affected.</p>
                            <p>Deliberate dieting (condition known as <dfn id="anorexia-nervosa">anorexia nervosa</dfn>) will lead to loss of weight, which in turn will lead to amenorrhea, hence failure to ovulate. On the other hand, sometimes obesity and infertility seem to be connected in women, probably because obese women ovulate and menstruate less frequently.</p>
                            <p>Chronic alcoholism or drug addiction may also lead to infertility. For example, morphine tends to depress ovarian activity.</p>

                            <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Psychological Factors</h4>
                            <p>Anxiety and tension seem to be responsible for infertility in some individuals. They manifest through changes in the neuroendocrine control of ovulation.</p>

                            <p>Some of the causes of infertility in females include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Congenital, also known as Mullerian agenesis, where there is no uterus or ovaries. Another factor is vaginal atresia, which is the narrowing or stenosis of the vagina.</li>
                                <li>Infections leading to tubal blockage, for example, sexually transmitted infections (gonococcal, chlamydia), tuberculosis, salmonella, enterobias vermicularis and postabortal or puerperal sepsis.</li>
                                <li>Endocrine due to pituitary adenoma with increased prolactin leading to inappropriate galactorrhoea which is associated with amenorrhoea and anovulation. Hormonal imbalance with increased oestrogen will lead to endometrial hyperplasia hence irregular period (metropathia haemorrhagica) or prolonged periods and cycles. Hypothyroidism is generally associated with infertility.</li>
                                <li>Diabetes mellitus, if uncontrolled or in those with severe complications may impair fertility.</li>
                                <li>Uterine fibromyoma, especially if it is large enough to distort the uterine cavity or block interstitial parts of the tube, may also cause recurrent abortion.</li>
                                <li>Cervical hostility, whereby the cervical mucus is unreceptive to spermatozoa and either prevents their progressive advance or actually kills them. It may be due to infection or the presence of sperm antibodies.</li>
                                <li>Cervical incompetence is almost always a cause of mid-trimester abortion and will lead to secondary infertility.</li>
                                <li>Endometriosis because of the menorrhagia may lead to infertility.</li>

                                <li>Congenital, for example, <dfn id="hypospadias">hypospadias</dfn> (ventral external urethra meatus) where the opening is congenitally malformed.</li>
                                <li>Undescended testes, where the testes either remain in the abdominal or inguinal canal or are retractile, that is, tend to go back in the abdomen. Take note that the temperature of scrotal contents is about $1^{\circ}$ Centigrade below the normal body temperature. Spermatogenesis is impaired if the temperature of the testes is raised and this is often the case with undescended testes. The temperature can also be raised by frequent hot baths, the use of thick, tight underclothes as well as living at high altitudes for too long.</li>
                                <li>Infections of bacterial origin, for example, gonococcal chlamydia will block the vas deferens after healing with scarring. Viral infection, especially mumps, can cause orchitis, interfering with spermatogenesis. Therefore, a male child suffering from mumps should be observed keenly for this complication.</li>
                                <li>Auto-immune problems whereby the cervix can be hostile to the sperm of a man and produce antibodies.</li>
                                <li>Impotence where there is no erection for unknown reasons.</li>
                                <li>Ignorance of coitus and in some cases excessive coitus.</li>
                                <li>Less sperm count (<dfn id="oligospermia">oligospermia</dfn>) or no sperms at all (<dfn id="azoospermia">azoospermia</dfn>).</li>

                        <h3 id="s5-heading-mgmt-infertility" class="subsection-heading">Management of Infertility</h3>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Infertility is a very stressful condition with a continuous cycle of hope and disappointment. Life centres around trying to conceive a baby and nothing else seems important. Partners blame each other and become frustrated and guilty. Patients should be managed by a gynaecologist, whose scope of intervention will depend on the services or technology available.</p>
                            <p>The couple should be investigated based on their general reproductive history. Clinical examination of each partner is carried out separately and any worries should be elicited and confidential information obtained from each partner.</p>
                            <p>In the male partner the following should be done. Take a history of sexual function, erection and ejaculation. Any past history of orchitis or STDs should be noted. It is important to establish how often intercourse takes place, whether there is any experience of difficulty in either partners, discomfort or lack of satisfaction (the male orgasm which brings about ejaculation of the semen is essential for fertilisation).</p>
                            <p>A clinical examination should also be done and should include an assessment of the size and consistency of the testes and epididymis on each side. You should also assess for the presence or absence of varicocele or hernia and the size of the prostate. Plan for action after the initial history and examination will include semen analysis. This should normally be the first step in an investigation because if there are no sperms present in the semen, it is pointless to investigate the female.</p>
                            <p>Prior to semen analysis, in preparation to collect specimen, the man abstains from coitus for three to five days and a masturbation specimen is then collected. It should be received in the laboratory within half an hour. In semen analysis, examine colour (if sturdy, then it is infected), viscosity, bacteriology (if pus cells present), motility (progressive, sluggish or no movement), morphology (the ideal is 50%) and sperm count (40 to 370 million sperms per cc). Note that in Kenya 20 million is considered an acceptable sperm count.</p>
                            <p>If the serum contains sperm antibodies, the spermatozoa become immobilised when they come into contact with the cervical mucus. The test should be done three times. Once the seminal fluid analysis has been done and found to be normal, then the next step is to test for ovulation and tubal patency in the female.</p>
                            <p>In the female partner, attention should be paid to any endocrine abnormality. A routine pelvic examination should also be performed. During history-taking, the following should be ascertained:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Any illness which might have caused peritonitis, for example, tuberculosis. This could mean the tubes were also affected.</li>
                                <li>Menstrual history, for instance, whether menstruation is scanty or irregular. Any abortion or sicknesses should be noted.</li>
                                <li>Outcomes of previous pregnancies should also be noted.</li>
                                <li>Marital history, including duration of marriage and how long she has been trying to become pregnant.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The plan of action after taking down the patient's initial history and examination should include a Hysterosalpingography (HSG), which remains a useful investigation for tubal patency. A laparoscopy plus dye test does not only allow assessment of tubal patency but also gives proof that the tube is normal in appearance, the fimbriae are healthy and that the tubal movement is adequate.</p>
                            <p>Ovulation may be confirmed in several ways, including the temperature method, the examination of cervical mucous, progesterone level on blood sample taken one week before a period is expected (day 21 of 28 day cycle) and a level of more than 20 mmol/L, which confirms that ovulation has taken place. An ultrasound may detect follicular growth and ovulation. A histological examination of the endometrium should also be performed just before menstruation in order to assess the response to progesterone secretion by corpus luteum and to exclude tuberculosis.</p>

                    <section id="s5-treatment-infertility" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="s5-heading-treatment-infertility">
                        <h3 id="s5-heading-treatment-infertility" class="subsection-heading">Treatment of Infertility</h3>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Not all couples that complain of infertility need to be investigated and treated. For short periods of infertility in a young couple, simple clinical assessment and reassurance that they appear normal is all that is required. Emphasise to the couple that if no abnormality is found, that pregnancy is always possible even after many years.</p>
                            <p>Treatment may take several forms. A detailed outline of ovulatory failure was covered earlier in section two. Tubal blockage can be treated by salpingolysis, which is the most successful tubal operation and consists of dividing peritubal adhesions around the ampullary ends of the tube.</p>
                            <p>Salpingotomy involves making an opening into the distal end of a hydrosalpinx and is usually better for fimbrial blockage. In tubal anastomosis, blockage, the isthmic portion is excised and the cut ends anastomosed.</p>
                            <p>During in vitro fertilisation, the oocytes from the mature ovarian follicle are retrieved, fertilised with the partner's sperm and the developing embryo is replaced into the woman's uterus.</p>
                            <p>In the male there are also various forms of fertility treatment, depending on the specific condition. Semen problems, such as azoospermia, secondary to lack of gonadotrophic stimulation, are curable by the administration of Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin (HMG). However, there is no treatment for azoospermia due to congenital anomalies or chromosomal abnormalities.</p>
                            <p>Synthetic androgens, for example, mesterolone (proviron), have a direct action on spermatogenesis. They should be administered at a dose of 50 mgs daily for three months.</p>
                            <p>Oligospermia will often respond to an improvement in the patient's general health and fitness, therefore, exercise and a good diet should be encouraged. The patient should also be advised to avoid excessive consumption of alcohol, tobacco and caffeine. Additionally, the excision of varicocele, if present, is commonly done for oligospermia.</p>
                            <p>Artificial Insemination (AIH) with the partner's semen is widely used for infertility due to impotence or anatomical abnormality in the male, especially in cases of hypospadias, which prevents normal ejaculation of sperm into the upper vagina.</p>
                            <p>You should also counsel the patient on general measures that may be helpful like refraining from excessive coitus, obtaining adequate sleep, weight-loss advice for obese patients and the need to avoid excessive and prolonged exposure of the scrotum to heat by avoiding hot bath, tight underwear or prolonged sitting in hot environments.</p>
                            <p>Some of the problems infertile couples may face will include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Poor social standing that is, not having respect from friends, relatives and the community as a whole.</li>
                                <li>The stress of infertility makes one be unproductive economically.</li>
                                <li>Sexual disinterest due to dyspareunia.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The frantic effort of wanting children will complicate the infertility leading to domestic disharmony, separation and divorces and/or promiscuity which may increase the risk of STI/HIV.</p>
                            <p>As you come to the end of this sub-section, you will now be able to identify couples with infertility and assist appropriately. You have covered the predisposing factors in both sexes and looked at the investigations and appropriate management.</p>

                        <p>In women <dfn id="climacteric-crisis">climacteric crisis</dfn> is the period of menopause (while in males it is known as andropause).</p>
                        <p><dfn id="menopause">Menopause</dfn> is a period in a woman's life when menstruation ceases naturally. There is progressive ovarian failure, which is preceded by complete absence of menstruation. Menopause is declared after one year of no menstruation. A considerable number of women will undergo physical or emotional upsets but the majority will not be significantly affected.</p>
                        <p>To some, menopause is a threatening period that declares the end of their femininity, while to others it is a time when many former diseases or ailments recur. A few will see this process as witchcraft or untreatable disease. You should note that sexual desire is present in most women for many years after menstruation ceases.</p>

                            <p>The climacteric symptoms occur as a syndrome. Menopausal syndrome refers to several symptoms related to hormonal imbalances in women. Menopause may occur without any symptoms other than the cessation of menstruation, but it is not infrequently associated with other symptoms. The most common of these is the occurrence of hot flushes.</p>
                            <p>A <dfn id="hot-flush">hot flush</dfn> is the flushing of the face and neck often with sweating. The flush may be only momentary or may last up to 15 minutes and recur many times a day. The flush occurs as a result of a rise in the peripheral blood flow (measured in the arm) and in the pulse rate, but no change in blood pressure. About 80 to 85% of women experience hot flushes. In Kenya these are often mistaken for malaria or typhoid.</p>

                                <strong>Remember:</strong>
                                <p>Flushes are particularly severe and abrupt when there is a change in the hormone balance, for example, after bilateral oophorectomy and, in men, after orchidectomy.</p>

                            <p>Other symptoms include weight gain in some women, which is generally a result of low-level activity. Exercise tends to promote hormonal balance. Osteoporosis can also result and has been attributed to oestrogen deficiency.</p>
                            <p>Atrophic changes in the vulva will cause discomfort and dyspareunia. A decrease in vaginal acidity may allow organisms to survive and lead to vaginitis or endometritis (this occurs in a small number of women). This may be confused for STIs.</p>
                            <div class="remember-block">
                                <strong>Remember:</strong>
                                <p>Decrease in circulating oestrogen levels will lead to increased excretion of calcium in the urine. Calcium is essential in bone development.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Anxiety, irritability, insomnia and depression are often present in varying degrees and are seen mainly in women who have a history of psychological instability. Additionally, aches, pains, headaches, urinary urge and incontinence are often as a physical expression of anxiety and depression. Some women experience severe headaches for unexplained reasons.</p>
                            <p>Periods may cease abruptly or gradually diminish at the menopause. Although excessive and irregular blood loss is not uncommon at about the time of menopause, it must never be accepted as normal or 'just the change'.</p>

                            <p>The majority of women soon adjust to their new situation. This is especially true if they get support and understanding from their husband and family. For some, their problems may be severe enough to warrant them seeking medical advice.</p>
                            <p>Oestrogen may be administered to suppress hot flushes and this may, in turn relieve sleeplessness and also help the depression. Some preparations that can be used include equine combined oestrogen (premarin) 0.62 mgs daily or oestrogen valerate (progynoval) 1 mg daily.</p>
                            <p>For atrophic changes in the genital tract, Dienestrol cream can be applied locally. Some doctors may give the treatment for several weeks to relieve symptoms, then gradually reduce the doses before discontinuing the treatment.</p>
                            <p>Long-term therapy (as long as ten years) may benefit the patient in preventing this condition, but on the other hand, may induce endometrial carcinoma or enhance the growth of pre-existing carcinoma of the breast. Therefore, it should be established as far as possible that no such tumour is present when this therapy is employed. Progesterone, if added, may prevent this.</p>
                            <p>Prophylaxis of osteoporosis is managed by increasing calcium intake. It is important for all women to know the importance of a balanced diet, especially plant foods, for example, fresh fruits and vegetables, which promote hormone production and especially soya beans, which have natural oestrogen.</p>
                            <p>The majority of middle aged or older women do not know what to expect at certain times in their later life, including the cessation of menstruation. Psychological counselling is often valuable and helps the patient understand the intricacies of the physiological changes that are taking place in her.</p>
