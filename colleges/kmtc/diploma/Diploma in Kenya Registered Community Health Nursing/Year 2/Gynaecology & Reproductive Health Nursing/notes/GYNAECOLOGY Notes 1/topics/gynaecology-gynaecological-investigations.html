The more thorough the history and physical examination, the better the chances of making an accurate diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>You may also need to carry out certain tests and investigations in order to come to the correct conclusion. However, in order to take a complete history and conduct a thorough investigation, you need to know what in particular you are looking for.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>History taking should place an emphasis on the gynaecological history of the patient. This does not mean that other histories should be ignored. For the sake of minimising repetition, you will not go through the whole process. When taking a gynaecological history, you should enquire into the following:</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Menstruation</h3>
                        <p>Menstruation, including the age at which she had her first menstrual period, that is, <dfn id="menarche">menarche</dfn> equivalent to ' K ', the length of the menstrual cycle, duration of the periods and the amount of blood loss and regularity as well as the date of the Last Normal Menstrual Period (LNMP).</p>
                        <p>Always record this information as 'K 13 5/28 regular'. This means that the periods began at the age of 13, last for five days and occur every 28 days.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Gynaecological Operations</h3>
                        <p>Take the history of any gynaecological operations, including the dates of operations. Possible gynaecological operations include dilatation and curettage, evacuation, laparotomy and hysterectomy and post-operative outcomes.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Contraceptive History</h3>
                        <p>Take the patient's contraceptive history, especially on surgical contraceptions, including the type of contraceptive, duration of use, side effects and when she stopped using it.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Sexual Behaviour</h3>
                        <p>Ask about the patient's sexual behaviour, noting that questions should be non-judgemental and you should not embarrass the patient. You should find out whether she is sexually active, whether the relationship is satisfactory and, if not, why. For example, find out if she has painful or difficult sex referred to as <dfn id="dyspareunia">dyspareunia</dfn>. In case of infertility find out also whether intercourse is normal, frequent and what time in the cycle. You need to ask if there is any post-coital bleeding or not. This information may well help you to detect any sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Lifestyle Habits</h3>
                        <p>Ask if she smokes or takes alcohol.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Summary</h3>
                        <p>You should make a summary of the history you have taken by picking out the important positive and negative information obtained. This will guide you when performing a physical examination.</p>

                        <p>A physical examination should be made up of a general, abdominal and vaginal examination. Abdominal and vaginal examinations were covered in module one, unit two, section three, so for now you will only look at general examination in detail.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">General Examination</h3>
                        <p>A general examination provides more information about a patient and also gives the clinician a chance to establish a rapport with the patient. General examination usually includes a check on the vital signs and the general condition of the patient. When you are doing a general examination, you should look for the development of secondary sexual characteristics, including breast development (palpate for masses) and body hair distribution, especially the pubic hair. Hair on the chest and chin in a female will mean that she has more androgens.</p>
                        <div class="remember-block">
                            <strong>Remember:</strong>
                            <p>Antiseptic is not used in this procedure because a specimen may be taken. If antiseptic is used to clean the vulva, it will destroy organisms hence leading to a false result.</p>

                        <p>Urinalysis should be carried out to check the appearance of the urine, including colour and foam, chemical content such as protein and glucose, and micro-organisms such as bacteria and parasites.</p>
                        <p>A pregnancy test, if indicated, may be performed.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Blood</h3>
                        <p>Blood should be tested for haemoglobin levels (Hb) or full haemogram, Widal test and brucellosis test and also for VDRL (syphilis).</p>

                        <p>Urethral smears and pus swabs should be taken to test for neisseria gonorrhoea. Take a high vaginal swabs test for candida albicans, trichomonas vaginalis, and neisseria gonorrhoea.

                        <p>Indications are similar to that of a culdoscopy. However, with laproscopy, it is also possible to perform minor operative procedures like tubal ligation, ovarian biopsy and lysis of peritubal adhesion.</p>
                        <p>During this examination, a scope (of about 10 mm diameter) is inserted into the peritoneal cavity through a two centimetre sub-umbilical incision to allow visualisation of the pelvic structure. Dilatation and curettage follows, to position a surgical instrument, which permits manipulation of the uterus during the laparoscopy, thus affording better visualisation.</p>
                        <p>The coldlight endoscope is passed through the cannula and the inspection made. An assistant or the operator himself can move the uterus about by means of the forceps on the cervix and a dilator or Spackman's cannula in the uterus. A camera attached to the eyepiece of the laparoscope permits assistants and observers to share the surgeon's view on a video screen and permits video recording of the findings or procedure.</p>
                        <p>Drapes are used during this procedure, but have been omitted in the illustration to allow unobstructed view.</p>
                        <p>Special biopsy forceps can be passed through another cannula and used to lift up any tissue that may be obstructing the view or to take ovarian biopsies. Some adhesions may be divided using laparoscopy scissors. Many procedures are now performed entirely or assisted by laparoscopy.</p>

                                <p>The procedure is performed under general anaesthesia, meaning patients have to be prepared preoperatively. The patient is carefully observed for several hours to detect any complications, for example, bleeding or burns from the coagulator. The observation includes monitoring vital signs and signs of per vaginal bleeding. Reassure the patient and discharge when the vital signs become stable.</p>

It is important for you to know them so that you can provide appropriate care and advice to the patient undergoing these tests. Many radiological procedures, for example, x-ray films, barium enemas and intravenous urography, are helpful in the diagnosis of pelvic conditions. A few of the procedures specifically related to the diagnosis of gynaecological disorders will be covered here.</p>

                        <p>A patient undergoing this examination should have her intestines evacuated by enema. 'Starve' the patient for at least four to six hours. Give analgesic for comfort since some patients may experience nausea, vomiting, cramps and faintness. Briefly explain the procedure to the patient and give reassurance. Observe the vital signs.</p>
                        <p>The patient may feel some discomfort after the procedure. You should continue observing her vital signs and if the patient is not nauseated, give her food as soon as she can tolerate it. You should also provide plenty of fluids to flush the urinary system.</p>

                        <p>A CT scan can reveal the presence of cancer and its extension into the retroperitoneal lymph nodes and skeletal involvement.</p>
                        <p>The CT scan has several advantages over an ultrasound and it is more effective, especially with obese patients and/or patients with a distended bowel or stomach. This is because it penetrates deep into the organ targeted and reveals more information about these organs. In preparation, the patient should be 'starved' before this procedure.</p>
                        <p>The scanner takes repeated x-ray pictures of a cross-section of the body (nearly 300 pictures within five seconds) as the x -ray tube is rotated around the patient.</p>
                        <p>Some absorption of x-rays takes place according to the density of the tissues through which the x-rays pass. Thus the difference between the amount of radiation entering the body and amount measured by the detectors is equivalent to the density of the tissues.</p>
