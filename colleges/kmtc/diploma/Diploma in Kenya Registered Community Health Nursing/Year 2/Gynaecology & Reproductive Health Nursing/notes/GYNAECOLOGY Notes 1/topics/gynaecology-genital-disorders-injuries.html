                            <p>Chronic irritation or vulvo-vaginal infection may result in benign epithelial thickening and hyperkeratosis. During the acute phases, as in diabetic vulvitis, the lesions may be red and moist, which provide evidence of secondary infection. The lesions may involve any portion of the vulva, adjacent thighs, perineum or perineal skin.</p>
                            <p>Invasive malignancies may also appear as white lesions of the vulvar skin. A biopsy should be able to detect whether malignancy exists or not. Periodic re-examination of specimen biopsies and the excision of more advanced lesions should be performed.</p>

                            <p>Topical corticosteroids, for example, 0.01% fluocinolone acetonide cream has proved helpful in hypertrophic lesions. A mixture of 1% hydrocortisone and 2 to 3% testoserone three to four times daily has been found to be particularly beneficial in the treatment of lichen sclerosis.</p>

                            <p>The most common cause of Bartholin's cyst is a gonococcal infection that causes obstruction. However, another probable cause is congenital narrowing of the duct. The patient will present with:</p>

                                <li>Oedematous and inflamed tissues around the Bartholin's gland</li>

                            <p>The main treatment for this condition is Incision and Drainage (I&D) of the infected cyst or abscess and preferably marsupialisation, which allows the abscess to drain properly thus preserving the function of the gland.

                            <p>The patient should be put on appropriate antibiotics.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are three muscles in the pelvic floor known as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The iliococcygeus</li>
                            <li>The pubococcygeus</li>
                            <li>The puborectalis</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition, the perineal body is made up of bulbocavernosus muscles and superficial transverse perineal muscles. The two muscles insert into the midline of the perineum, posterior to the vaginal introitus and anterior to the rectum.</p>
                        <p>The lower rectum and vagina are supported by the bulbocavernosus. The urethra, vagina and rectum are supported by the endopelvic in the middle of the pelvis.</p>
                        <p>The cardinal ligament and uterosacral ligaments assist in suspending the uterus and adjacent organs so that they do not prolapse whenever there is increase in intra-abdominal pressure.</p>
                        <p>Excessive stretching and trauma may result in tears of the endopelvic fascia. This allows the base of the bladder to drop posteriorly forming a cystocele. Subsequently the urethra falls away from its normal position behind the symphysis pubis and forms an urethrocele.</p>
                        <p>The fascial support in the pelvis of Caucasian women seems to be more susceptible to being damaged than that of oriental/black women for reasons that are not yet well understood.</p>
                        <p>Now move on to look at three conditions that are related to relaxation of the pelvic support. These are cystocele, rectocele, and uterine prolapse.</p>

                            <p>This is the herniation of the bladder through the anterior vaginal wall. It may be classified into the following degrees:</p>

                                <li>Mild cystocele, where the anterior vaginal wall prolapses to the introitus upon straining.</li>
                                <li>Moderate cystocele, where the vaginal wall extends beyond the introitus upon straining.</li>
                                <li>Severe cystocele, where the vaginal wall extends beyond introitus in the resting state.</li>

                            <p>A small cystocele will generally cause no significant symptoms but if it is a large one, the following symptoms may be noticed:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>It will bulge out of the vaginal introitus and make the patient complain of vaginal pressure or it may manifest as a protruding mass that may give her feeling that she is 'sitting on a ball'.</li>
                                <li>Symptoms are aggravated by vigorous activity, prolonged standing, coughing, sneezing or straining. They are relieved by resting and assuming a recumbent or knee-chest position.</li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>The insertion of a pessary or tampon in the lower part of the vagina, which may provide temporary support. However note that prolonged use may eventually lead to pressure necrosis and vaginal lacerations.</li>
                                    <li>Exercises in young patients will give definite improvement of pressure symptoms.</li>
                                    <li>Oestrogen in post-menopausal women for a number of months may greatly improve the tone, quality and vascularity of musculo-fascial support.</li>
                                    <li>Surgical measures especially for large cystoceles, causing retention and recurrent bladder infection. The most common measure is anterior-vaginal colporrhaphy, which ensures the most effective surgical correction of a cystocele. By preventing further pregnancies, a hysterectomy averts the problem of vaginal delivery, which would destroy the bladder support provided by the anterior colporrhaphy.</li>

In the long term, it is advisable to wait until the woman has had all the babies she wants in order to intervene especially for rectocele causing symptoms. Surgically, posterior colpoperineorrhaphy is usually curative. To ensure permanent integrity of the rectocele repair, the patient should be advised to avoid straining, coughing and other strenuous activities and prevent constipation through a proper diet, plenty of fluid intake and the use of stool softening laxatives and lubricating suppositories.</p>
                                <p>Recurrence of the condition after adequate repair is uncommon if chronic constipation has also been corrected. Subsequent vaginal deliveries should be avoided, hence pointing to the need for elective Caesarean section.</p>

                            <p>The most likely causes of uterine prolapse will be:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Uterine prolapse occurs most commonly in multiparous women, like the cystocele and rectocele conditions with which it is usually associated.</li>
                                <li>In Caucasian women, it occurs as the result of gradually progressive injuries to the endopelvic fascia due to childbirth and lacerations of muscles, especially the levator muscles and those of the perineal body.</li>
                                <li>The condition may also be the result of pelvic tumour, sacral nerve disorders, especially injury to the S1-4, diabetic neuropathy, caudal anaesthesia accident and pre-sacral tumour.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Additional factors promoting uterine prolapse include systemic conditions like obesity, asthma, chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis. Also important are local conditions like ascites, large uterus and ovarian tumours. A congenital type is seen in newborn infants during vigorous crying or vomiting (this type is common among the Pokot in Kenya).</p>
                            <p>A uterus that is in retroverted position is especially subject to prolapse. Prolonged labour may play a causal role and the condition is said to be more common amongst those who lead a largely sedentary life, usually with individuals who are immobile and/or obese.</p>

                            <p>Some common causes of fistula include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Obstructed labour due to pressure by the presenting part, causing necrosis. This accounts for 85% of cases in developing countries.</li>
                                <li>Radiation therapy for gynaecological conditions, which accounts for 15% of cases (usually many years after treatment).</li>
                                <li>Disease processes, such as carcinoma in advanced stages of the neighbouring organs.</li>
                                <li>Chronic tuberculosis or syphilis.</li>
                                <li>Congenital fistula, that is, an accessory ectopic ureter, which may open into the vagina. This condition can be recognised in childhood.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The main symptoms and diagnosis of VVF include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The patient keeps on complaining of constant dribbling of urine from the vagina and generally does not pass any urine by the normal route.</li>
                                <li>On inspection with Sim's speculum, the fistula is situated in the midline half way up the anterior vaginal wall. This usually occurs as a result of prolonged labour. Postoperative fistulas are generally higher up.</li>
                                <li>Small fistulae admit a probe with difficulty, but may be seen on cystoscopy. Large fistulae admit one or two fingers.</li>
                                <li>Coloured fluid (methylene blue) runs into the bladder through a catheter and immediately flows out into the vagina.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This condition may also affect the individual patient in different ways. Some patients report that they do not experience any sexual enjoyment. In addition, there is the possibility of psychogenic amenorrhea and vulval excoriation with urine. The individual may feel like a social outcast.</p>

                            <p>Most of the rectovaginal fistula are as a result of unrepaired third degree lacerations of the perineum and posterior vaginal wall, or repairs that have broken down so that an opening is left from the rectum into the vagina. Advanced cancer of the rectum or vagina can also cause RVF but this is rare.</p>
                            <p>Common symptoms of RVF include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>With small fistulae, only mucus from the rectum may leak into the vagina. If the fistula are larger, faeces and flatus escape into the vagina.</li>
                                <li>The patient will complain of feculent vaginal discharge.</li>
                                <li>An inspection of the posterior wall of the vagina and the use of a probe will demonstrate the smaller fistula.</li>
                                <li>Perineal excoriation due to leakage of urine and faecal matter.</li>
                                <li>Symptoms may also depend on the site of the fistulae. If on the lower half of the vagina there is incontinence, flatus, or fluid faeces while if on the upper half there is continuous passage of faeces per vaginum.</li>

                            <p>First and foremost, prevention is easier than cure. In most cases fistulae formation can be avoided by:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ensuring that labour does not go beyond 12 hours.</li>
                                <li>Frequent emptying of bladder or catheterisation during normal labour since a distended bladder is easily traumatised by the pressure of the presenting part, especially in cephalic presentation.</li>
                                <li>Control of infection and excoriation (use of infection prevention principles).</li>
                                <li>In the event of destructive delivery due to prolonged labour, catheters should be left in situation for 48 hours to seven days.</li>
                                <li>For VVF, recently formed fistulae will heal if the bladder is drained continuously for 21 to 28 days and for RVF, a low residue diet should be given for the same period.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Where surgery is indicated, it is important that fresh VVF is repaired at once. However, if it is only noticed some days after the injury, then two to three months should be allowed to elapse before the repair. This allows local damage and infection to settle and urinary infection to be eradicated. Most VVF can be closed by an operation via the vaginal route.</p>
                            <p>In the management of a patient who is due for surgical correction the pre-operative care will include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Blood for haemoglobin level, urea, Intravenous Pyelography (IVP) for ureteric fistula.</li>
                                <li>Examination Under Anaesthesia (EUA) to detect the type of fistulae.</li>
                                <li>Dye test (methylene blue) into the bladder to detect site of fistulae.</li>
                                <li>Nursing care, including proper nutrition to ensure fitness for the operation.</li>
                                <li>The woman will need a lot of encouragement and support since it can be a very distressing time.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>After surgical correction, the following specific care should be given:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Great care should be taken to secure constant drainage of the bladder to enable the repair to heal well. The catheter should remain in situ for 10 to 14 days.</li>
                                <li>Relieve discomfort, give analgesics.</li>
                                <li>Prevent infection by giving prescribed antibiotics.</li>
                                <li>Ensure proper nutrition with increased intake of vitamin C and proteins but low residue.</li>
                                <li>Ensure maintenance of local cleanliness through douching, enema and warm perineal irrigation.</li>
                                <li>RVF is repaired after a course of antibiotics to reduce bowel infection.</li>
                                <li>Also sterilise the gut with tabs cabbracol 500 gm BD for five days.</li>
                                <li>Give enema on the morning of the operation.</li>
                                <li>After the operation, the patient should be placed on a liquid diet for two weeks.</li>
                                <li>Liquid paraffin 10 ml tds for two weeks, followed by analgesics and broad spectrum antibiotics.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Together with the above, ensure that you provide other general postoperative care, for example, regular observation and personal hygiene.</p>
