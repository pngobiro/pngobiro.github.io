                        <p><dfn id="amenorrhoea">Amenorrhoea</dfn> is a symptom, not a disease. It is derived from the Greek word amenrein, which translates as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A... without</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>It can, therefore, be interpreted to mean 'without monthly flow', thus amenorrhoea means 'absence or cessation of menstruation'. The absence of menstrual periods can be physiologically normal.</p>
                        <p>Move on to find out at which point amenorrhoea is considered to be normal.</p>

                             <p>Name at least three periods in a woman's life when amenorrhoea is considered normal.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Your answer should include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Before puberty, when the hormones concerned have not started functioning.</li>
                            <li>During pregnancy, when the hormones concerned are diverted to the growth of the fertilised ovum.</li>
                            <li>During lactation (after delivery), which results in lactation amenorrhoea due to the presence of prolactin.</li>
                            <li>At menopause, when the hormones diminish and cease to be produced.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You have focused on pathological amenorrhoea, which can be divided into two, namely primary and secondary amenorrhoea.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- START: s2-primary-amenorrhoea -->
                    <section id="s2-primary-amenorrhoea" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="s2-heading-primary-amenorrhoea">
                        <h4 id="s2-heading-primary-amenorrhoea" class="subsubsection-heading">Primary Amenorrhoea</h4>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p><dfn id="primary-amenorrhoea">Primary amenorrhoea</dfn> means that menstruation has never occurred. This is seen in a young woman who is over 17 years of age and who has not yet begun to menstruate but exhibits signs of sexual maturation. Pathological primary amenorrhoea is when the patient has never menstruated and has not developed secondary sexual characteristics.</p>
                            <p>There are two main factors that lead to primary amenorrhoea. These are hormonal factors and developmental anomalies.</p>

                            <h5>Hormonal Factors</h5>
                            <p>This is due to the malfunctioning of the pituitary gland. As a result, the hormones responsible for sex maturation are affected, which in turn affects the beginning of menstruation.</p>
                            <p>In Cushing's syndrome, the excessive production of cortisols may hinder menstruation from starting.</p>

                            <h5>Developmental Anomalies</h5>
                            <p>During the development of the foetus, the vagina, uterus or ovaries may fail to develop. The congenital abnormality in the vagina that causes primary amenorrhoea is an imperforate hymen. In this case, the girl experiences all the feelings and discomforts of menstrual flow. There is actually menstruation and the blood accumulates behind the hymen, (in the vagina), but does not come out. This condition is known as <dfn id="cryptomenorrhoea">cryptomenorrhoea</dfn> and when not treated, the uterus distends, leading to what is known as <dfn id="haematometra">haematometra</dfn>. The girl may present with abdominal pain and the absence of menstruation. The condition can be cured by an incision of the hymen to allow the blood to flow out freely. After the incision you should advise the girl to maintain high standards of hygiene. The vulva should be cleaned three times a day until healed.</p>
                            <p>Other causes include male pseudohermaphroditism (a male develops as a female) and Turner's syndrome where one has only one x-chromosome.</p>
                            <p>Now move on to look at secondary amenorrhoea.</p>
                        </div>
                    </section>
                    <!-- END: s2-primary-amenorrhoea -->

                    <!-- START: s2-secondary-amenorrhoea -->
                    <section id="s2-secondary-amenorrhoea" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="s2-heading-secondary-amenorrhoea">
                        <h4 id="s2-heading-secondary-amenorrhoea" class="subsubsection-heading">Secondary Amenorrhoea</h4>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p><dfn id="secondary-amenorrhoea">Secondary amenorrhoea</dfn> simply means that the periods, which were once present, have stopped.</p>
                            <p>There are some women who have a longer cycle of up to two to three months and this is considered normal as long as it is regular. However, secondary amenorrhoea occurs after a normal menarche, which then ceases for more than six months. Six months is a considerable duration for it to be abnormal.</p>
                            <p>Now move on to look at some of the possible causes of secondary amenorrhoea.</p>
                            
                            <h5>Hormonal Disturbances</h5>
                            <p>Hormonal disturbances in the pituitary gland can lead to hypopituitarism, especially after severe postpartum haemorrhage and collapse. This leads to pituitary cachexia/Sheehan's disease. In this condition, there is temporary deprivation of blood supply to the pituitary, leading to ischaemia. This impairs the functions of the pituitary gland.</p>
                            <p>In addition, disturbances in the adrenal gland, thyroid gland and/or ovaries can affect the influence of the hypothalamus on the pituitary gland.</p>

                            <h5>Debilitating Systemic Disorders</h5>
                            <p>Chronic diseases that cause general ill health, for example, genital tuberculosis, or severe anaemia may lead to secondary amenorrhoea.</p>

                            <h5>Nervous Disorders</h5>
                            <p>Any stress can act on the hypothalamus to inhibit follicle stimulating hormone/leutinising hormone-releasing hormone. This may lead to stress or hypothalamic amenorrhoea. Minor emotional upsets related to being away from home, attending college, tension from schoolwork or interpersonal problems are the most common causes of secondary amenorrhoea, especially in adolescents.</p>
                            <p>Other related disorders that cause stress include longstanding psychiatric disorders, especially depression or anxiety and stress due to exercise, which leads to exercise amenorrhoea. This is especially common in marathon runners.</p>
                            <p>Others include brain tumours which may destroy the hypothalamus.</p>

                            <h5>Drugs</h5>
                            <p>Contraceptives may lead to post contraceptive amenorrhoea and in some individuals it may take three to six months before the return of menstruation. This is because the ovulation had been suppressed and therefore had an effect on the hormones concerned.</p>
                            <p>Phenothiazines, especially in large doses, may lead to amenorrhoea due to prolactinaemia and certain hypotensive agents have also been implicated. You may remember (as mentioned in lactation amenorrhoea) that these drugs stimulate prolactin.</p>

                            <h5>Dietary Amenorrhoea</h5>
                            <p>Loss of weight due to prolonged fasting will affect the hypothalamic function in ways which are not yet understood. Nutritional deficiency will also affect menstruation.</p>

                            <h5>Ovarian Cysts</h5>
                            <p>Ovarian cysts, especially follicular and corpus luteum cysts, cause amenorrhoea, however these tend to regress with time and menstruation resumes.</p>

                            <h5>Oligomenorrhoea</h5>
                            <p>Finally, this is a type of amenorrhoea where there is infrequent menstruation, which may occur months before menopause and, at times, due to emotional upset.</p>
                            <p>A woman with this problem should be investigated thoroughly to exclude other serious conditions, for example, neoplasms. You should reassure the patient if the cause of the condition is emotional.</p>

                        <p>After discussing both types of amenorrhoea, you will now look at their management.</p>
                        <p>First, establish the cause of the condition. In each case you must take a detailed history and then carry out a clinical examination to rule out pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>You should also consider the general health of the woman, including psychological and environmental factors. In the case of a young girl who appears normal on examination, it is better to wait until she is 18 years old but in the meantime reassure her and give her health education on sexuality.</p>

                            <p>This is very important as it helps you make a distinction between primary and secondary amenorrhoea and, therefore, institute appropriate management measures.</p>

If the patient is experiencing the physical disturbances of menstruation without actually bleeding, a cyclical change in the hormone level can be assumed and the cause of amenorrhoea is likely to be in the genital tract.</p>

                            <h5>Clomiphene Citrate (Clomid)</h5>
                            <p>If ovulation is the problem, then it can be induced using clomiphene citrate. This drug should be restricted to those individuals desiring pregnancy because it acts on the Graafian follicle. It can also be used in adolescents with recurrent ovulatory bleeding in an attempt to establish regular ovulatory cycles.</p>
                            <p>The dosage initially given is 50 mg daily for five days and ovulation is expected to occur five to eleven days following discontinuation. If there is no response, the dose is gradually increased up to 200 mg.</p>
                            <p>Side effects of clomid include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hyper-stimulation leading to enlargement of the ovaries.</li>
                                <li>Multiple gestation because more than one ovum may mature.</li>

                                <li>Teratology, that is, the increased incidence of congenital anomalies, if conception takes place while the woman is still taking the drug.</li>

                            <h5>Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin (HMG) and Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (HCG) Pergonal</h5>
                            <p>This is a preparation of leutinising hormone and follicle stimulating hormone extracted from human menopausal urine and is available in ratio of 1:1.</p>
                            <p>The therapy is indicated when there is failure to ovulate even after clomid administration for six to twelve months. The dosage is HMG 375 units daily, increasing progressively up to 1500 units daily.</p>

                            <h5>Bromocriptine</h5>
                            <p>This is effective as an ovulatory agent in most patients with hyperprolactinaemia from an anaplastic source.</p>
                            <p>It acts by suppressing the central and peripheral concentrations of prolactin, so that its level stimulates the production of oestrogen and progesterone. The dosage initially is 2.5 mg up to four weeks.</p>

                            <h5>Other Agents</h5>
                            <p>Other agents used for the induction of ovulation include glucocorticosteriods (dexamethosone 0.5 mg nocte, prednisone 0.75 mg ) and oestradiol (estrogen).</p>
                            <p>Do not forget that emotional disturbance is one of the features that cause amenorrhoea. Such patients will require psychotherapy to relieve the tension/stress. Through history taking, you may be able to get clues to any emotional stress and try to allay the patient's anxiety.</p>

                        <p><dfn id="dysmenorrhoea">Dysmenorrhoea</dfn> means painful menstruation. Some women experience pain and discomfort during menstruation and many will learn to live with it. However, in some women the pain is severe enough to make the woman seek treatment.</p>
                        <p>There are two types of dysmenorrhoea:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Primary Dysmenorrhoea (also known at Spasmodic Dysmenorrhoea)</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Now move on to look at these in more detail.</p>
                    </div>

                    <section id="s2-primary-dysmenorrhoea" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="s2-heading-primary-dysmenorrhoea">
                        <h4 id="s2-heading-primary-dysmenorrhoea" class="subsubsection-heading">Primary (or Spasmodic) Dysmenorrhoea</h4>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>You may have come across young girls seeking treatment due to abdominal pain during menstruation. This is a common complaint and usually starts soon after puberty, although the first few cycles may have been painless.</p>
                            <p>The pain starts at the beginning of the period and lasts from a few hours to two days. This pain is 'cramp-like' and is felt in the pelvic and lower back region, and may radiate into the legs. Severe pain is sometimes accompanied by nausea, vomiting and fainting. These reactions may encourage the woman to seek treatment.</p>
                            <p>The causes of this condition are not well known but several theories have been put forward. It may probably be caused by ischaemia due to prolonged contraction of the uterine muscle occurring in the first day of menstruation. The ischaemia means that oxygen to the uterine muscle is cut off accounting for the pain. In this case, it is said that childbirth may cure this condition since after the uterus has held the baby, it is more vascular and so not easily ischaemic.</p>
                            <p>It has also been posited that dysmenorrhoeic uteri are hypoplastic but there is no evidence. Endocrine abnormalities have occasionally been implicated, probably due to the imbalances. Prostaglandins from disintegrating endometrium may cause uterine spasms (that is why in cases of dysmenorrhoea the concentration of PGF2 in menstrual fluids is increased).</p>
                            <p>Psychological factors undoubtedly aggravate symptoms, for example, there may be fear of sexual or reproductive abnormalities, leading the uterus to spasm.</p>
                            <p>Cervical stenosis also seems to be a factor. It is believed that during pregnancy and delivery the stenosed cervix is dilated hence the reason the problem may disappear after delivery.</p>

                            <div class="content-card">
                                <p>Unfortunately, a spontaneous cure does not occur soon enough for most women who suffer from primary dysmenorrhoea. Therefore, as part of your management, you should perform the following:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Take history with special reference to the severity and duration of the pain.</li>
                                    <li>Perform a physical examination to exclude pelvic tumours.</li>
                                    <li>Give a full and frank discussion of the normal cycle as this is an important part of treatment.</li>
                                    <li>Share health messages on the importance of exercise and the avoidance of unnecessary restriction of general activities.</li>
                                    <li>Provide women suffering from dysmenorrhoea with sympathy and support. Administer a suitable drug which will alleviate the pain sufficiently to allow a normal existence during the period time. Fortunately, patients tend to improve or at least complain less as they grow older.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Drugs that can alleviate pain include any antipyretics and analgesics. These should be the most effective drugs to inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandin, that is, if the prostaglandin's theory is correct.</p>
                                <p>These include aspirin and paracetamol, which are widely used and usually prescribed as two tablets three times daily. Mefenamic acid (ponstan) 500 mg three times daily is also common. This drug is said to prevent the action of prostaglandin on muscles as well as inhibit its production. Other drugs include flufenamic acid (arlef) and indomethacin (indocid).</p>
                                <p>Many of these drugs are usually prescribed for the relief of rheumatic pain but have been used with success in dysmenorrhoea.</p>
                                <div class="remember-block">
                                    <strong>Remember:</strong>
                                    <p>These drugs must be used carefully as they can adversely affect patients with other medical disorders, including asthma. Do not give strong analgesics like morphine, pethidine and other addictive drugs.</p>
                                </div>
                                <p>Another effective management method is the contraceptive pill. In a small number of girls, when simple measures fail, they can be put on the family planning pill which, by inhibiting ovulation, will result in painless periods. These few individuals should be placed on the pill for four to six months continuously, after which the problem may disappear completely. This is achieved with a high-progesterone, low-oestrogen combined pill, for example, minovular.</p>
                                <p>Surgery, in the form of pre-sacral neurectomy, may be offered as a last resort to a patient whose dysmenorrhoea cannot be relieved by any other means and is interfering with her daily life.</p>

                            <p>This type of dysmenorrhoea may be caused by some pathology in the pelvis. The patient usually complains of a dull aching pain in the lower abdomen. The pain commonly begins three to four days (or sometimes up to ten days) prior to menstruation, and ceases after the flow is established or may persist throughout the period.</p>
                            <p>Pain is often made worse by exercise.</p>

                            <p>The causes of secondary dysmenorrhoea include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Chronic Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases (PID)</li>

                            <p>These conditions and their management will be covered later in this unit and also in the next unit (unit six). It is important to remember, however, that in this country the most common cause of secondary dysmenorrhoea is chronic PID and also with most women complaining of infertility.</p>
                            <p>Treatment of the cause will usually relieve the dysmenorrhoea, but as you know successful treatment of chronic PID is difficult and so prevention should be emphasised.</p>

                        <p>Patients with the symptoms of PMT can be relieved by giving them diuretics, for example, chlorothiazide in the pre menstrual week.

                        <p>Tranquillisers and psychotherapy also appear to be equally effective.</p>
                        <p>Patients should be told about the physiology that is producing these symptoms because they may think they have a terrible disease and the worries may increase the intensity of these symptoms.</p>
                        <p>Dietary management involves taking a low salt diet and avoiding alcohol and caffeine.</p>
                        <p>Exercise is also recommended to relieve the symptoms.</p>

                        <p>Once you have excluded the conditions mentioned above, the cause of DUB is most likely to be hormonal imbalance, which is associated with involuntary periods.

                        <p>In the hospital, teenage girls who have just started menstruating should be given a combination of oestrogen and progesterone. The contraceptive pill is a good option and treatment should be continued for three to six cycles. After treatment is stopped, menstruation often returns to normal.</p>
                        <p>For women in the reproductive age group, true dysfunctional bleeding is uncommon. The most likely cause of abnormal bleeding at this age is some complication of pregnancy. Diagnostic curettage is needed and you must remember the possibility of malignant disease.</p>
                        <p>In women over 40 years of age all the organic causes of bleeding, including malignant disease, may occur. Accurate diagnosis, including curettage is essential.</p>

                        <p><dfn id="menorrhagia">Menorrhagia</dfn> is a normal cycle with an excessive loss of blood (heavy menstrual flow). The normal average volume of menstrual loss is approximately 70 ml . Menstrual loss is naturally greater in parous women.</p>
                        <p>Menorrhagia is clinically an important condition because this excessive bleeding results in anaemia. It is not a disease but a symptom and to treat it one must find out what is causing it. The best way to manage this condition is to refer the patient to hospital where investigations will be carried out and managed appropriately.</p>
                        <p>The most common causes of menorrhagia include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fibroids due to a larger endometrial cavity hence larger bleeding areas</li>

                            <li>Abnormalities in the blood clotting power, for example, leukaemia, thrombocytopenic purpura</li>

                        <p>This condition is as a result of the endometrial tissue being deposited in any organ of the body, for example, the ovary or uterosacral ligaments.</p>
                        <p>The ectopic tissue consists of both glands and stroma in which cyclical menstrual changes occur. Malignant changes are very rare. The process where the endometrial tissues invade the myometrium in the uterus is referred to as internal endometriosis or <dfn id="adenomyosis">adenomyosis</dfn> (the uterus is enlarged). There is no difference clinically between adenomyosis and fibroids on feeling the uterus, but they are different histologically.</p>
                        <p>Endometriosis occurs only in tissues adjacent to the Mullerian systems (a pair of ducts in the female foetus which develop into reproductive system). The theories, which explain the occurrence of endometriosis include that it may be disseminated by means of the lymphatic and vascular system, which is why endometrial tissue may be found in the umbilicus, forearm and thigh.</p>
                        <!-- The MMD has a duplicate heading here "Endometriosis or Adenomyosis". I will treat the following text as a continuation under the current H3. -->
                        <p>Endometriosis is also strangely common in social groups where childbearing is delayed to the late twenties or early thirties. This might explain why it is rarely diagnosed before the age of 20 years and not apparent after menopause.</p>
                        <p>Physical signs will depend on the site of the disease and they include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>'Chocolate cysts' which are tender, fixed, bilateral masses, resembling chronic salpingoophritis but without any history of infection, fever or discharge.</li>
                            <li>Uterine lesions may cause nodular or uniform uterine enlargement and may be clinically indistinguishable from fibromyomata or diffuse hyperplasia.</li>
                            <li>Recto-vaginal lesions are tender, hard fixed and simulate rectal carcinoma.</li>
                            <li>Local lesion, for example, in scars may be tender at menstrual periods.</li>
                            <li>Dysmenorrhoea occurs and any palpable tumour may become painful at the time of the menstruation.</li>
                            <li>Recto-vaginal lesions will cause dyspareunia.</li>
                            <li>Menorrhagia and irregular bleeding occur from associated endometrial hyperplasia or from uterine lesions.</li>
                            <li>Infertility occurs in 30% of patients with endometriosis and this is due to pelvic adhesions or endometrial abnormalities.</li>

                            <p>The first step is to take a detailed history to elicit the symptoms of dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia and dyspareunia. There are rarely abnormal findings on abdominal examination.</p>
                            <p>Refer the patient to a gynaecologist. On vaginal examination, the uterus may be enlarged and tender (adenomyosis). Areas around the ovaries are tender and, characteristically, there is limited mobility of uterus. A cyst is sometimes palpable in either fornix.</p>
                            <p>Speculum examination may reveal typical areas of endometriosis in the cervix or vaginal vault. A laparotomy is indicated when cystic swelling is felt or if you are in doubt of the diagnosis.</p>
                            <p>If the patient is under 40 years of age, surgical treatment is usually designed to destroy areas of endometriosis using diathermy function. Hormonal therapy should include either progesterone steroids when confirmed, administered either cyclically or continuously for three to twelve months (this therapy suppresses the residual areas). Pregnancy is another way of suppressing the condition, and often has a curative effect on endometriosis.</p>
                            <p>Patients over 40 years of age may undergo a hysterectomy, which can include the removal of the affected ovary since hormonal therapy is not always helpful.</p>
