                            <p>These are painful menstrual periods. Nearly 50% of all women have some degree of pain associated with their periods. About 10% are unable to perform their normal activities because of this pain.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Cause:</strong> This is due to release of a chemical substance called prostaglandins from the lining cells of the uterus at the time of menstrual period. The prostaglandin causes contractions of the muscle wall of the uterus, which are called menstrual cramps.</p>
