                            <p>One of the core roles of a perioperative nurse, working together with the multidisciplinary team is to ensure patient safety and depending on which perioperative speciality they work in, they will be responsible for a variety of elements of care, including the management of specialist equipment, devices and drugs.</p>
                            <p>There are several drivers for standardising training and education in the perioperative environment.</p>
                            <p>‘Surgery is an inherently risky process and surgical systems are highly complex’ (NHS England, 2015a; 2014:4).</p>
                            <p>There is universal agreement on the need to protect patients from harm and therefore it is essential that all registered perioperative nurses have met a minimum standard of education for safe practice. A good example is setting up the taskforce following the never events policy framework that concluded ‘that to achieve a continual reduction in harm, they must reduce variation in practice, promote learning from our mistakes and inform improvement activities, and continue to promote organisational and professional responsibility’.</p>
                            
                            <p>It also proposed a strategy of three interlocking elements namely:</p>

                            <p>Theatre nursing has developed alongside the history of surgery. Surgery is an old form of treatment that can be traced back through the history of man.</p>
                            <p>In the past, there were no theatres, no trained personnel, no anaesthesia and no equipment. Operations were performed at home.</p>
                            <p>Problems during this time included infection, bleeding and pain. However, with time, efforts were made to solve these problems.</p>

                            <h4>Haemorrhage Control</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In order to control haemorrhaging, the ancient Greeks and Romans as far back as the 16th century BC, used strings as ligatures.</li>
                                <li>Later on, during the Middle Ages, they came up with the use of <strong>hot iron</strong>.</li>
                                <li>This idea has been developed into the use of <strong>cautery</strong> to control bleeding.</li>
                                <li>By the beginning of the 20th century, many types of ligatures were available, prepared from <strong>metal</strong>, <strong>nylon</strong> and <strong>cotton</strong>.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Infection Control</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The control of infection dates back to the efforts of Louis Pasteur, who proved that bacteria caused infections.</li>
                                <li>In 1865, Joseph Lister used <strong>carbonic acid</strong> to reduce the growth of bacteria in wounds.</li>
                                <li>In 1886 Von Bergemen introduced <strong>sterilisation of dressings</strong>.</li>
                                <li>Gloves were introduced in surgery in 1890.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Theatre nursing is as old as nursing. A theatre nurse is a member of a bigger team, all of whom work together to provide a safe passage through the operating theatre for every patient.</p>
                            <p>Theatre team includes (the nurse, anaesthetist, surgeon, theatre assistant).</p>
                            <p>However small or insignificant the task to be performed, the theatre nurse is responsible for the success of the procedure. They must, therefore, be highly skilled and trained, in order to be able to ensure a successful outcome for the patient.</p>
