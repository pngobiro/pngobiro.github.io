                            <p>Inflammation is the body's response mechanism to cellular damage. Without the inflammatory response our bodies could not survive. Therefore, inflammation is a protective mechanism designed to rid the body of the cause of injury and prepare our tissues to rebuild themselves following injury.</p>
                            <p>The inflammatory response (see Figure 6.1) is a local reaction that involves release of antibacterial substances that defend the body from attack. The inflammatory process walls off the injured area so that toxins cannot affect the whole system. Finally, it puts in place the infrastructure that enables the body to heal itself and be restored to its normal functioning. In many ways, inflammation could be described as a homeostatic mechanism. The major signs and symptoms of inflammation are redness, pain, swelling, heat and loss of function. These are brought about by chemicals liberated by plasma proteins and cells. The plasma proteins and various white cells squeeze through the walls of capillary vessels and gain access to the site of tissue damage, infection or foreign body. This response is brought about by a variety of chemicals in the body which open up blood vessels (vasodilation) and act as messengers to summon white blood cells to the appropriate location. This messaging system is referred to as chemotaxis.</p>
                            <p>Inflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic. Both types will now be described.</p>

                            <h3>Acute inflammation</h3>
                            <p>An example of this would be an insect bite. The nature of acute inflammation is characterized by its rapid onset and short duration. This response is intended to remove debris from the tissue, such as micro-organisms and other particles of dead tissue. At the same time, the body sends messages to the bone marrow, which trigger a greater manufacture of phagocytic cells, particularly neutrophils, which have the ability to digest invading organisms. Finally, other chemical messengers summon these phagocytic cells from the area of damage by the process of chemotaxis.</p>
                            <p>One of the first chemicals to be released in the acute inflammatory response is called histamine. This is released from a type of body cell called a mast cell. The role of histamine in the body is to produce vasodilation and increase the permeability of blood vessels. This in turn allows fluid and phagocytic cells to move from the intravascular fluid to the extravascular. The whole area of damage becomes flooded with fluid, plasma proteins and phagocytic cells. This fluid is called acute inflammatory exudate and its presence is detected by looking for the cardinal signs of inflammation discussed earlier.</p>
                            <p>Acute inflammation can be seen as almost a balance between the amount of damage caused by the invading organisms and the damage caused by the body's response in terms of trying to safeguard surrounding normal tissue. The inflammatory process itself will almost inevitably cause some damage to tissues by its efforts to save other tissues. This balancing act, therefore, has three possible end points:</p>

                            <h3>Chronic inflammation</h3>
                            <p>As stated earlier, this usually arises when a noxious substance is not removed by the acute inflammatory process. There are times when chronic inflammation is not preceded by the acute inflammatory process. This is often the case in what are termed autoimmune diseases, where the body's defence mechanisms appear to be turned on themselves. Inflammation and destruction of normal body tissue by autoimmunoglobulins takes place. For some reason, the body is detecting some of its own tissue as foreign.</p>
                            <p>In chronic inflammation, the cells that are found at the site of injury differ from those for acute inflammation. The body is mounting a more specific defence and this is mirrored in the type of white cell found in the inflamed area. Rather than lots of neutrophils and macrophages being present, there are now large amounts of lymphocytes. Attempts to repair the tissues are now evident as fibrosis as a result of thick bands of collagen fibres being laid down in a desperate attempt to heal the site of injury. In order for natural resolution to occur, the patient may need help via antibiotic therapy, having the foreign body removed or having nutritional support.</p>

                            <p>In order to understand the pharmacological action of certain anti-inflammatory drugs, we must probe deeper into physiology and focus our attention on a group of substances called eicosanoids. These include prostacyclin and thromboxane (which you will come across again in Chapter 7 on anticoagulants), and prostaglandins and leukotrienes. These agents are very important in triggering the inflammatory response and are formed when a fatty acid called arachidonic acid is liberated from a damaged cell membrane by action of an enzyme known as phospholipase.</p>

                            <p>NSAIDs are a large and popular group of therapeutic agents. Their main use is as an analgesic to treat mild to moderate pain (see Chapter 4). Examples include ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen and paracetamol. They are frequently prescribed for orthopaedic complaints, such as osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions. They are also a very popular OTC medication for minor aches and pains.</p>
                            <p>This group of drugs works by inhibiting the formation of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are naturally occurring substances and are released when cell membranes are damaged in some way. They are responsible for dilation of vessels, causing redness and swelling. Some of them also sensitize the receptors that are responsible for us feeling the sensation of pain (see Chapter 4).</p>
                            
                            <p>Cyclo-oxygenase pathways in most pharmacological texts are denoted by the prefix COX followed by the number of the pathway (e.g. COX1). The prostaglandins derived from COX1 are to do with the smooth running of body systems; in particular they help to maintain the protective mucous lining of the stomach and intestine. COX2 in comparison produces prostaglandins that facilitate pain and inflammation.</p>
                            <p>The vast number of current NSAIDs block both pathways. This is problematic as the drugs reduce the pain and inflammation associated with COX2 but also reduce the homeostatic function of COX1. This leads to a number of GI problems, the most significant of which is peptic ulceration. Often, oral administration of a prostaglandin substitute, such as misoprostol, may be used. This helps to ensure limited damage to the stomach mucosa. Also, some doctors will prescribe a drug known as a proton pump inhibitor which limits the amount of acid secretion by cells in the stomach wall. An example of a proton pump inhibitor would be omeprazole.</p>

                                <p>Normal doses of NSAIDs in healthy individuals do not usually pose much of a risk. However, in patients that have other medical conditions such as heart failure, these drugs can cause acute kidney problems. Patients who are likely to react in an adverse way to this group of drugs should have their blood checked at regular intervals for signs of renal insufficiency.</p>

                            <h3>Naproxen</h3>
                            <p>This is a commonly used NSAID in the reduction of pain, fever, inflammation and stiffness associated with conditions such as arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis (a chronic arthritis of the spine). Naproxen is often one of the first choices when treating an inflammatory condition because it is very effective with relatively few side-effects. However, ibuprofen is still the safest (see Chapter 4).</p>
                            <p>The dose of naproxen will vary depending on the condition it is being used to treat. However, the usual adult dose is $250-500 \mathrm{mg}$ twice daily. Because of potential effects on the gastric lining a drug such as misoprostol may also be used.</p>
                            <p>Naproxen is associated with several suspected or probable interactions that affect the action of other drugs. For example, it may increase the blood levels of lithium by reducing the excretion of lithium by the kidneys. Increased levels of lithium may lead to lithium toxicity. Naproxen may reduce the blood pressure-lowering effects of blood pressure medication because prostaglandins play a role in the regulation of blood pressure.</p>

                            <h3>Cyclo-oxygenase pathway 2 inhibitors</h3>
                            <p>It would appear from our description of COX1 as good prostaglandin formation and COX2 as bad prostaglandin formation that an obvious solution to the problem would be to come up with a group of drugs that first inhibited the COX2 pathway. Indeed, this is what has happened. This search for COX2 specific drugs resulted in a number of early forerunners - valdecoxib, celecoxib and rofecoxib. However, in 2004 rofecoxib (VIOXX) was withdrawn voluntarily from the market due to studies which suggested that it increased the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. These sideeffects are linked to prostaglandin inhibition.</p>

                            <h4>Celecoxib</h4>
                            <p>Celecoxib belongs to a new generation of NSAIDs that selectively block the action of COX2. This means that it stops the production of inflammatory prostaglandins without stopping the production of prostaglandins that protect the stomach and intestines. It therefore reduces pain and inflammation, but is less likely than traditional NSAIDs to cause side-effects on the stomach and intestines (although such side-effects are still possible).</p>
                            <p>This medicine is commonly used for various types of joint and muscular conditions, such as arthritis. The lowest effective dose should be used for each patient. For the management of osteoarthritis, the dose is usually 100 mg twice daily or 200 mg as a single dose. For rheumatoid arthritis, the dose is usually 100 or 200 mg twice daily.</p>

                            <p>Aspirin is a very versatile drug (see also Chapters 4 and 7). In terms of its anti-inflammatory properties, it is used in the treatment of rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory joint conditions. Aspirin is another drug which blocks the COX1 pathway, but also inhibits the COX2 pathway. Furthermore, aspirin has been found to have effects on the release of energy at a cellular level, especially in the liver and cartilaginous tissue. It induces chemicals that enable white cells to fight infections more effectively.</p>
                            <p>Aspirin is a weak acid drug that will readily be absorbed in the stomach due to its acid environment. However, much of the absorption takes place in the ileum, the third part of the small intestine, due to its large surface area.</p>
                            <p>Aspirin is taken orally and can be obtained in a soluble form, where it is mixed with calcium carbonate and citric acid. This aids its rate of absorption into the body.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Adverse effects</h4>
                            <p>Some of the adverse effects caused by aspirin are similar to those previously described as sideeffects of NSAIDs - for example, GI complaints. In addition to these are a group of symptoms caused by central nervous system disruption. These include dizziness, tinnitus, loss of hearing, visual disturbances and headache. The drug should not be given to children as it can cause a life-threatening disorder called Reyes syndrome.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Overdose</h4>
                            <p>Overdose with aspirin has serious consequences. More serious symptoms of poisoning include high body temperature (hyperthermia), increased respiratory rate (tachypnoea), metabolic acidiosis, confusion, cerebral oedema and coma. Aspirin overdose is still classified as a medical emergency.</p>

                            <p>Histamine is a chemical liberated by the body, which contributes to the inflammatory response and is found in most body tissue. However, the lungs, skin and GI tract have high concentrations. It is also found in cells, namely mast cells and basophils. Histamine also occurs in cells in the stomach and certain neurons in the brain.</p>
                            <p>Histamine has an action on a number of different receptors. As we will be discussing drugs that affect histamine receptors (H-receptors), it is necessary to describe how histamine acts on the bodily systems that contain these receptors. Smooth muscle, except that in the cardiovascular system, contracts; the blood vessels have the opposite action of dilating. H-receptors also bring about an increase in the permeability of blood capillaries.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Antihistamines</h4>
                            <p>The term 'antihistamine' usually refers to drugs that block the action of histamine on H-receptors. This class of drug affects various inflammatory and allergic responses. If we block the body's ability to respond to the release of histamine then the inflammatory response, in terms of vasodilation and increased permeability of vessels, will no longer take place or will be modified.</p>
                            <p>Most drugs in this category are given orally as they are well absorbed by the body. Generally, most reach a peak in the plasma after one or two hours. These drugs are well distributed throughout the body and some do not cross the BBB and, therefore, cause less sedation than those that do.</p>
                            <p>Cyclizine, dimenhydrinate and cinnarizine do cross the BBB and can be used for motion sickness. Non-sedating antihistamines, such as terfenadine, are mainly used for hay fever and mild allergic reactions. The drug can, however, rarely cause serious cardiac problems. Some non-sedating drugs in this category can now be purchased as OTC medicines, for example loratadine and cetirizine.</p>

                            <p>Steroid hormones include a group known as glucocorticoids. These are secreted by an area of the adrenal cortex known as the zona fasciculate. Glucocorticoids are involved in the body's response to stress. First, they have a pronounced effect on carbohydrate and protein use. The hormones cause a decrease in the uptake of glucose by the body's cells and an increase in glucose production via the breakdown of proteins (gluconeogenesis). This leads to a net increase in the blood sugar (hyperglycaemia).</p>
                            <p>The important role of glucocorticoids as far as this chapter is concerned is their powerful antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. They not only stop initial redness, pain, heat and swelling but also affect the healing and repair process. They have the ability to stop all types of inflammatory response whether caused by physical stimuli or inappropriate immune responses in the body.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Administration</h4>
                            <p>Glucocorticoids can be given a number of ways. Most types can be administered by mouth and all can be given via the IM or IV routes. They can be applied in a cream to the skin or given as eye drops or nasal sprays. They may be administered directly into joint spaces (intra-articularly) or into the lungs by means of an aerosol. Examples of glucocorticoid drugs are prednisilone, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone and beclomethasone.</p>

                            <h4>Side-effects</h4>
                            <p>Side-effects (see Box 6.1) are a very important issue, however, these are more likely when these drugs are given systemically rather than locally or when they are prescribed in high doses over an extended period of time.</p>

                            <p>As we have described, glucocorticoids such as cortisone can be used to treat inflammation. A local injection into the joint space, for example, may be used for a variety of inflammatory musculoskeletal conditions. In order to treat inflammation that is more widespread in the body, the person may be prescribed systemic injections. Local injections of cortisone may be used to treat a condition known as bursitis.</p>
                            <p>Giving the corticosteroid as an injection means that it can be targeted more directly into tissues that are locally inflamed. Using a more direct route in giving the medicine means that its effects are more rapid and powerful than if it were given by the oral route. This means that a single injection is more likely to avoid some side-effects that we have mentioned previously, notably gastritis (irritation of the stomach).</p>

Therefore, any sudden withdrawal will lead to a gross insufficiency and the patient may well enter what is called a 'steroidal crisis'. Patients should be phased off their medication slowly to allow the body to recover its natural abilities. This normally takes about two months, although it may take much longer.</p>

                            <p>Rheumatoid arthritis is thought to be an autoimmune disease. In people with this condition, antibodies are formed against the synovial membrane (the capsule which surrounds each joint). This causes inflammation in and around the affected joints. Over time, the inflammation causes damage to the joint, the cartilage and parts of the bone involved in forming the joint.</p>
                            <p>We have already discussed two classes of drugs that are used in this condition, namely NSAIDs and glucocorticoids. However, the group of drugs most frequently used in treating this disease goes under the umbrella term of 'disease-modifying antirheumatoid drugs' (DMARDs).</p>
                            <p>The DMARD group includes a variety of drugs with differing chemical structures and, therefore, modes of action, such as sulfasalazine, gold compounds, penicillamine, chloroquine, methotrexate and leflunomide.</p>

                            <h4>Sulfasalazine</h4>
                            <p>Sulfasalazine is a pro-drug, which means that it is not active in the form in which it is given. The drug is broken down into two active components by bacteria that live in the bowel: 5 aminosalicylic acid and sulfapyridine.</p>

                            <h4>Gold compounds</h4>
                            <p>As with sulfasalazine, the effect of gold compounds occurs slowly. The patient may not feel any benefit from the medication for a period of three or four months. Gold is usually given as either sodium aurothiomalate or auranofin. Sodium aurothiomalate is administered by deep IM injection whereas auranofin is given orally.</p>

                            <h4>Penicillamine</h4>
                            <p>This drug was discovered in the 1950s as being in the urine of patients who had taken penicillin. The drug itself has no antibiotic properties and is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis due to its immunosuppressive effects. The exact nature of its action is still being debated.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Methotrexate</h4>
                            <p>Methotrexate works on DNA, the genetic material within the nucleus of a cell. As with most drugs in this classification, it is not known how exactly methotrexate works in relation to rheumatoid arthritis, but empirically it has been shown to reduce the amount of inflammation and slow the progression of the disease. It is usually the drug of choice as a first-line treatment following diagnosis.</p>

                            <h4>Chloroquine</h4>
                            <p>This drug is used mainly in the treatment of malaria. However, it is shown to reduce progression of disease in rheumatoid arthritis. The drug is generally used in milder cases of the disease or in combination with other DMARDs. It takes about three to six months to show any reported effects.</p>

                            <h4>Leflunomide</h4>
                            <p>This drug is thought to work on the cell's DNA and RNA. The immune cells cannot function or reproduce effectively due to the drug's effect. Hence, leflunomide reduces inflammation in the joints, as well as slowing down progressive bone erosion and joint deformity.</p>
