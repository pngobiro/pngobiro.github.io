                        <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Nurses are bound by the code of conduct laid out by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). In addition, nurses are governed by the legislation surrounding medicines. Administration of medicines is a skill that you will be exposed to during your pre-registration education. It is most important that you become involved in this procedure so that you can become confident and competent.</p>
                        <p>In 2008 the NMC set out guidance for the administration of medicines highlighting the importance of identifying the <strong>correct patient</strong>, the <strong>correct drug</strong>, the <strong>correct dose</strong>, the <strong>correct site and method</strong> of administration, and the <strong>correct procedure</strong>.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">1. The Correct Patient</h3>
                            <p>It is essential to know the background of the person (capacity to consent, allergies, diagnosis). In acute settings, the safest way to identify a patient is by checking their wristband (identity band) against the prescription chart. This should contain core identifiers: surname, forename, DOB, and NHS number. In community settings, verbal confirmation is often used.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3 class="card-title">2. The Correct Medicine</h3>
                            <p>Most medicines have two names: the <strong>generic</strong> (approved) name and the <strong>proprietary</strong> (brand) name. Prescription charts usually use the generic name, while stocks may show brand names. Packaging can be misleading; you must ensure the drug being checked matches the prescription exactly. Never transfer drugs between containers.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3 class="card-title">3. The Correct Dose</h3>
                            <p>The NMC suggests nurses must have an understanding of what they are giving, not just mechanically follow instructions. Knowledge of drug actions and using the <strong>British National Formulary (BNF)</strong> is imperative. Mathematical skills are crucial to avoid under- or over-dosing. If you are unsure about a calculation, do not be rushed; always recheck answers and do not agree simply to save face.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3 class="card-title">4. The Correct Site and Method</h3>
                            <p>Drugs are designed for specific routes (e.g., sublingual vs buccal). Giving a drug by the wrong route can be fatal (e.g., IV drugs given intrathecally/epidurally). Ensure you understand the specific route required (SC, IM, IV, Oral, Rectal, etc.).</p>

                        <h3>Covert Administration</h3>
                        <p>Covert administration (hiding medicine in food/drink) to a capable adult is, in law, <strong>trespass</strong>. Treatment requires consent. If a patient lacks capacity, professionals rely on the principle of <strong>necessity</strong> (acting in best interests). Covert administration should only happen in exceptional circumstances involving multi-disciplinary decisions, not as a routine practice.</p>

                        <h3>Mental Capacity and Consent</h3>
                        <p>The <strong>Mental Capacity Act (2005)</strong> protects those who cannot make decisions. It allows for advanced decisions and Lasting Power of Attorney. For children under 16, the <strong>Fraser Guidelines</strong> allow professionals to treat without parental consent if the young person understands the advice and it is in their best interests (originally specific to contraception but applied broadly).</p>

                                <p>Crushing tablets or opening capsules renders the use <strong>unlicensed</strong> (outside the product licence). This alters pharmacokinetics and can cause adverse effects. A nurse doing this undertakes liability. Always seek a liquid alternative or pharmacist approval first.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Reporting Errors</h3>
                        <p>The NMC encourages an open, no-blame culture. If a drug error occurs, it must be reported immediately as a duty of care. Student nurses should not ignore errors they witness.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Response:</strong> The nurse must be a qualified <strong>Supplementary Prescriber</strong> (V300 course). This allows quicker access to medication and holistic care. If she couldn't prescribe, Mrs Simpson might struggle to get to a pharmacy or GP.</p>
