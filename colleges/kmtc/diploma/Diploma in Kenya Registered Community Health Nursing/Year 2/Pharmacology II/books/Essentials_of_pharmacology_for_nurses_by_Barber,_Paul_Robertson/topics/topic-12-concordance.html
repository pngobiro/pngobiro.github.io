                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Medicines that are prescribed but not taken by patients represent a large loss in drug and prescribing costs and an enormous waste of expensive health professionals' time. In 2007 the National Audit Office estimated that about £100 million is wasted each year on medication dispensed but returned to pharmacies.</p>
                        <p>The aim of this chapter is to introduce the reader to the concepts of adherence, compliance and concordance with respect to medicine management. Nurses need to have an understanding of pharmacology at a level which will allow them to inform and educate the patients in their care. Without effective information and education surrounding their medications, many patients are unable to understand the need for them to take their medications as prescribed to ensure optimum drug performance.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-title">Adherence, compliance and concordance</h2>
                        <p>Much of the time, we use the terms adherence, compliance and concordance almost interchangeably, when in fact they each have quite different and specific meanings.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3 class="card-title">Adherence</h3>
                            <p>Adherence has a dictionary definition that suggests sticking to something. When we talk about patients adhering to their medication regimen we quite literally mean: are they sticking to the prescribed instructions for taking their medication? For a patient to adhere to their medication regimen, they need very little information from the prescriber.</p>
                            <p>They attend a consultation and present the prescriber with a problem or symptom. The prescriber makes a diagnosis, prescribes the medication and the patient is issued with a prescription to take for dispensing. Information needs to be given verbally to the patient about how to take their medication, and printed instructions are issued with their drugs. The patient needs to read the instructions or follow the prescriber's guidance and adhere to that.</p>
                            <p>Non-adherence to medication regimens can have serious consequences, depending on the medication being prescribed. Failure to adhere is, not surprisingly, a particular problem in the management of chronic illness, especially when the patient does not feel ill (e.g., hypertension).</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3 class="card-title">Compliance</h3>
                            <p>Compliance with a medication regimen differs from the act of simply adhering to it. By complying with the prescriber's instructions the patient automatically adheres to the medication regimen. But compliance suggests that information is given to allow the patient to make the choice to comply.</p>
                            <p>There is some involvement of the patient in the medication regimen, but compliance relies largely on the patient following the prescriber's recommendations. Some patients do not like the term 'compliant' as it suggests that if they diverge from the regimen, they are seen as non-compliant, a negative term.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3 class="card-title">Concordance</h3>
                            <p>Concordance is where the patient–prescriber relationship surrounding medication regimens is seen to be more equal in footing and there is an ongoing initiative to further involve patients in the treatment process and so improve their compliance and adherence. This requires active participation by the patient, and a confident and self-aware prescriber or medicines educator.</p>
                            <p>Concordance involves the sharing of knowledge, understanding and beliefs by both parties. The prescriber offers their knowledge and expertise of the condition to be treated and the range of treatment options available. The patient brings their knowledge of their lifestyle and practices to the equation (e.g., work patterns, social/religious aspects, manual dexterity). By good knowledge-sharing and communication an effective decision as to the most appropriate medicine to be prescribed can more easily be reached.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Patient awareness of consequences:</strong> Patients' perceptions of the benefits and risks influence compliance. For example, understanding that untreated hypertension increases the risk of stroke and heart attack is vital.</p>

                        <p>Patients who suffer from long-term or chronic diseases often want to be empowered in the management of their conditions. Education and information are the keys to patient empowerment. Sources include the internet, leaflets, and help groups.</p>

                        <h3>Patient education</h3>
                        <p>Education should be individualized. Nurses should provide medication leaflets and plan teaching sessions with specific outcomes. Before teaching, assess the patient's existing knowledge to avoid being patronizing.</p>

                        <h3>Patients as partners in decision-making</h3>
                        <p>Many patients want to be active partners in decision-making. Asking patients' views and listening is more effective than telling them what to do. However, some patients prefer the "doctor knows best" approach, and their wishes should be respected.</p>

                                <br>2. Perceived severity (seriousness).
