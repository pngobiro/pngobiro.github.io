                            <h4>Viral Hepatitis Overview</h4>
                            <p>There are number of specific viruses that cause hepatitis. The most common of these are hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus, and hepatitis E virus. Another hepatitis G virus has been discovered, but its role in acute viral hepatitis has not been established. Although the manifestations of infection are similar in hepatitis A through E plus G, these conditions differ in incubation period, mode of transmission, and severity.</p>

                            <h4>Etiology and Risk Factors</h4>

                                    <p>Hepatitis A is transmitted primarily by the fecal oral route. It spreads from person to person by close contact or by the handling of feces contaminated articles.</p>

                                    <p>Health care workers are at high risk for acquiring hepatitis B because of their close contact with the blood of carriers.

                                    <p>The major sources of hepatitis B are carriers and clients in the acute phase of the infection. Contact with the serum of an infected person is the major mode of transmission. The virus also may be transmitted by other body fluids such as saliva and semen.

                            <h4>Pathophysiology</h4>
                            <p>The pathophysiologic features are similar regardless to the cause. Hepatocytes undergo pathologic changes induced by the body's immune response to the virus. Inflammation of the liver with areas of necrosis occurs, and the resultant damage leads to impairment of function. The degree of functional impairment depends on the amount of hepatocellular damage. The endoplasmic reticulum- responsible for protein and steroid synthesis, glucuronide conjugation, and detoxification- is the first cellular organelle to undergo change, and liver functions that depend on these processes are altered. Kupffer cells increase in size and number. Vascular and ductular tissues undergo inflammatory changes. Healing of the damaged hepatic tissue generally occurs in 3-4 months.</p>

                            </ul>

                            <h4>Clinical Manifestations</h4>
                            <p>Manifestations during the early phase may include jaundice, lethargy, irritability, myalgia, arthralgia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, fever and other flu-like symptoms. Deterioration of handwriting, drowsiness and irritability are early manifestation of hepatic encephalopathy.</p>
                            <p>Bleeding tendencies may develop either from reduced prothrombin synthesis by injured hepatic cells or from reduced absorption of the fat soluble vitamin K due to reduced levels of bile in the intestines.</p>
                            <p>Liver gets enlarged in hepatitis and is tender to palpation. Levels of serum aminotransferases first rise and then begin to fall as bilirubin starts to increase.</p>

                            <p>Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gall bladder, usually caused by the presence of gall stones (cholelithiasis) or other obstructions in the bile passage. It is more common in women than in men.</p>

                            <p><strong>T-Tube Care:</strong> If the common bile duct is explored, a T tube is inserted. Nursing care involves avoiding kinking, securing the bag, applying protective ointment, and watching for normal brown stool when the tube is removed (usually after 7 days).</p>

                            <p>Acute pancreatitis may result in autodigestion of the pancreas by its own enzymes. Etiology includes alcohol abuse, cholelithiasis, trauma, and metabolic factors.</p>

                            <p>Pathological changes are due to premature activation of proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes. Normally activated in the duodenum, in pancreatitis, activation occurs before secretion into the intestine, causing pancreatic tissue damage.</p>
