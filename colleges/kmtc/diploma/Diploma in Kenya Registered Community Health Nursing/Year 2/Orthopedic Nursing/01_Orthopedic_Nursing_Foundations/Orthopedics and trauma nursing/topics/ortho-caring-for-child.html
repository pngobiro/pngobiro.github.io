                        <p>This chapter, although dedicated to ‘children’, continues to build upon the transferable knowledge and skills discussed in earlier sections of this book. The terms ‘child’ and ‘children’ will be used collectively to refer to the neonate, infant, child and young person. The common concepts of informed consent, pain assessment/management and safeguarding are included. Assessment and planning of care alongside educational and psychological issues considered pertinent to this client group will provide a foundation for this. Subsequent chapters will then build upon this within the context of ‘children’s nursing’ for the child presenting with a common orthopaedic condition or injury. Additional team members who help to create a positive child and family experience are further introduced within this chapter. Chapter 22 further reflects fundamental aspects of care pertinent to orthopaedics and trauma, but from a child perspective e.g. caring for the child in spica cast (Figure 21.1).</p>

                        <p>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) recognises that children are a vulnerable group who need special consideration in all respects, including healthcare. Children’s nurses are, therefore, committed to safeguarding vulnerable children and improving standards of care. A significant review of the UK National Health Service (NHS) (Kennedy 2010) in respect of meeting the needs of children and young people in light of widespread concerns expressed about a particular case (Laming 2009) found many services needing improvement with only a minority deemed excellent. The report also found that general practitioners had little or no experience of paediatrics as part of their professional training. Safeguarding was also considered an ongoing challenge alongside transition into adult services, with parents who were frustrated due to poor sharing of information by health professionals. The report stated that children were a low priority in health care and that they needed a ‘champion’ within such complex care organisations. The Kennedy report (2010) was positive about the value of ‘benchmarking’ to develop a range of standards. A benchmark is a process of comparison between the performance characteristics of separate, often competing, organisations intended to enable each participant to improve its own performance. An example relating to children’s musculoskeletal wellbeing is examined in Box 21.1.</p>

                            <p>This publication offers a portfolio of succinct evidence on the key elements required to effectively care for the infant, child and young person requiring orthopaedic and fracture trauma-related nursing care.

The publication has also been reported upon by Shields and Clarke (2011) who described it as limiting, when used to guide clinical practice within a children’s ED setting. This book builds upon the RCN publication as each benchmarked area of practice is further explored here.</p>

                        <h3>Age definitions</h3>
                        <p>Variations exist, but a general consensus suggests that key phases in respect of age are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Neonate</strong> - a newborn infant less than four weeks old</li>
                            <li><strong>Infant</strong> - less than one year but more than four weeks old</li>
                            <li><strong>Child</strong> - over one year old but before puberty</li>
                            <li><strong>Young person/adolescent</strong> - between puberty and adulthood (up to 18 years old).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Psychosocial and educational issues that relate to the infant, child and young person are central to their wellbeing and the outcomes of the care they receive. The term ‘psychosocial’ refers to the child’s ability to, consciously or unconsciously, adjust and relate themselves to their social environment. The term ‘educational’ refers to the provision of knowledge or instruction required as part of the child’s development that must be incorporated into the care process.</p>
                        <p>The overarching family dynamics, culture, language and age of a child affect their physical and cognitive development and the achievement of expected milestones. Age is central, as the needs of an infant are very different from that of a young person. For example, a young person may experience anxiety and fear related to insults to dignity and altered body image and need acceptance within their peer group. They have a right to have a voice, to be heard and to have their vulnerability acknowledged regardless of their presenting condition and treatment. At the opposite end of the age continuum, the infant has increased vulnerability and dependence and their growth and development must be central to individualised and holistic nursing care. The child’s experience of health professionals, hospital admission and pain are an important consideration in planning care and a full and effective assessment is needed, even for day surgery, as it must identify associated risk and promote a positive child experience of the care episode.</p>
                        <p>Assessment of the child on admission to hospital must include involvement of the parent and child when possible. History taking can be confounded by the child and parents failing to remember old or previous conditions and incidents but which remain pertinent to anaesthetic, surgery and planning of care. Honesty should be maintained whenever possible as children do not often forgive or forget if an untruth is revealed, affecting the nurse/child relationship leading to an anxious or non-compliant child and an angry parent (Box 21.2). Resources, culture, language, social services, school, peer group, age, body image and discharge planning can present barriers to parent and child education and communication. Benchmarks (RCN 2007) identify a number of areas that relate to this (Box 21.1).</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span>The importance of telling the truth to children</h4>
                            <p>One example of a difficult admission involved a six-year old child carrying a suitcase who appeared somewhat confused on arrival. The assessment process uncovered parents who thought their child unable to cope with the truth so told her she was going on holiday. The lack of parental truth-telling had a direct impact on the child’s hospital experience, but proactive inclusion of ‘clown doctors’ and a play specialist helped the child’s experience to be salvaged, resulting in a positive outcome.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The needs of the infant, child and young person have been charted across the decades by a variety of government reports (Platt Report 1959, Laming 2003, Children Act 2004). Even with the differences and similarities of children and adult patients acknowledged and continually debated, there is a widely accepted recognition that the ‘children’s nurse’ is best placed to care for this client group (Clarke 2007). It must be noted, nonetheless, that not all children will have a children’s nurse caring for them in all health care settings. Prequalifying children’s nursing programmes have evolved with increasing degrees of academic demand. Registered nurses are often ‘dual’ qualified, having a professional and academic award in both children’s and adult/general nursing. Depending on individual need, children requiring continued care in the community are ideally placed under the care of the Children’s Community Nurse (CCN) or Public Health Nurse. Many adult registered nurses and other fields of nursing may be able to care for this client group effectively but often not in a child-friendly environment. Clarke (2007) advocates that the children’s nurse should have equal opportunity to complete recognised continuing education in caring for the child with orthopaedic conditions and fracture trauma - adult orthopaedic and trauma nurses currently have better access to such continuing professional development.</p>
                        <p>Hydration and nutrition are key components of child health and wellbeing. The child’s immature and developing skeletal system can result in an extreme metabolic response to injury, surgery and fasting, resulting in a high risk of poor outcomes if diet and hydration are not carefully considered. The practitioner needs to be aware of the importance of a balanced diet in maintaining normal childhood development and expected milestones. Dietary assessment history is essential in identifying the child’s likes and dislikes for food texture and presentation. While BMI (body mass index) charts are used in adult patients, standard practice with children is to plot the child’s weight and height on centile charts which provide better indicators of child growth and development. Hydration is equally as important as diet, but assessing fluid balance can be problematic in the child. For example, assessing urinary output can be difficult due to the use of nappies and obtaining a midstream specimen of urine (MSSU) can be problematic due to lack of understanding and anxiety associated with using a ‘bedpan’ for the younger child. Diet and hydration are explored in greater detail in Chapter 10.</p>
                        <p>Children receiving orthopaedic or trauma care come from a variety of diverse patient groups, ages and cultures. Challenges often exist in communicating with the child and family in respect to cultural and language barriers and difficulties, for example, the use of touch in some cultures. Family dynamics, especially where there is obvious dysfunction, can also have an impact on the care process.</p>
                        <p>The infant, child and young person can struggle to have a say in their care and the practitioner caring for children is best placed to advocate for the patient (NMC 2008). The management of disclosure of sensitive information needs to be carefully handled. The child who presents with a fracture and has a learning disability may present specific challenges to the assessment and delivery of care particularly in the acute environment, which may not be well organised to address their specific needs. The ‘complex’ or ‘special needs’ child reinforces the need for a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach with the children’s nurse as the ‘key worker’ within the team. This group of children requires additional knowledge and skill in providing safe and effective care. Chapter 22 further explores these issues.</p>
                        <p>Assessment of risk is fundamental to wellbeing and positive outcomes in all parts of the journey of care and in all settings (Corkin et al., 2012). All children undergoing surgery, for example, require care that gives a high priority to their ASA level (the American Society of Anaesthesiologists grade given to each patient using a scale in relation to their fitness for undergoing an anaesthetic), as this predicts the need for 24-hour Paediatric Intensive Care Unit support (see Chapter 14 for further detail).</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Children are cared for in a wide range of settings with an emphasis on home care with the intention of reducing hospital acquired infections and keeping the child within the family home and normal routine. Even so, the child is often cared for within acute hospital settings, day procedure units, outpatient clinics, hospices and residential units which are not dissimilar to adult care settings. Because of concerns about child safety, however, children should be cared for in units that have specific security measures in place including closed circuit television surveillance and locked doors to promote safety. The ideal environment should meet the specific needs of children; it should be light, spacious and colourful with appropriate decoration, pictures and toys for young children and a dedicated area for young people. Bathroom and toilet facilities need to meet the needs of the child and specifically the child with mobility problems. Sensory rooms can provide a relaxing atmosphere for those with special needs.</p>
                        <p>Livesley and Long (2013) contemporarily explored the views of hospitalised children using an ethnographic design and two-stage research method that valued children throughout the whole research process. A theme of ‘different worlds’ was identified which relates well to the philosophical assumptions of qualitative research, as ‘one ward’ was noted as two worlds, even when the children and nurses were actually within the same environment, they lived there differently with each having different goals and realities. Challenges around the child’s voice and competence were also uncovered as the nurse held power around lighting, TV and access to the playroom etc. The parent was also undervalued and often viewed as incompetent like the child, by the nurse. Children had to accept the change of routine which often differed from home. This recent empirical study, although small, is important for policy makers, nurse educators and for the professional who cares for children.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A wealth of health professionals and lay persons participate in the care of the child, from the specialist/advanced nurse to the allied health professional working within a multidisciplinary team, CCN , parent and beyond. Chapter 5 provides an overview of the team approach and nursing roles within orthopaedics and fracture trauma with some principles that can be transferred to the care of the child. Additional roles have been developed to promote effective care of children. The fundamental role of play in child wellbeing and development must be considered in providing the right care environment for children, again with a specific focus on the child who has difficulty mobilising. Playing is a familiar activity for most children and is central to relieving stress and boredom. Dissimilar to adult care but highly valued within children’s nursing the parent, play specialist/therapist and arts-based ‘clown doctors’ are all utilised to generate a more positive hospital experience for the child.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Play specialists</strong> work with children of all ages regardless of their health problem. They plan and supervise activities that help the child to express their feelings through play and encourage development of creative skills to provide an outlet for the child’s thoughts and worries and offering ways to adapt to the new environment. This involves managing preadmission ‘clubs’ and using play to welcome children to hospital and preparing them to cope with surgery or other procedures. This enables the child to express and manage their fears about separation from parents and encourages the child to maintain their usual interests whilst using specific play techniques to minimise stressful events by acting them out in advance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Clown doctors</strong> are professional performers who are specially trained to work in hospitals with the aim of creating fun, laughter, play, communication and creativity in clinical environments. They visit children who are chronically and acutely ill and who are hospitalised, children who are in hospice care, children and young people with severe or profound disabilities and those with life-limiting conditions. Further information can be found at the http://www.artscare.co.uk/clowndoctors/ website. It is important to note, however, that not all children like clowns.</li>
                            <li><strong>The parent or guardian</strong> has parental responsibility for a child. Simons et al. (2001) suggest that children benefit from their parents’ presence during a hospital admission and this is a key principle commonly adopted by children’s units. Parental involvement can also be challenging for the attending nurse due to child-focused anxiety. It is also recognised that a child’s siblings and other family members such as grandparents can play an important part in the child’s wellbeing and in maintaining social links in hospital.</li>

                        <p>Effective care planning through all care phases and health care settings is pivotal in achieving positive outcomes for the child and family. The complexity of modern families, however, makes this challenging, especially when the child’s long-term care transfers to adult services as they become older. Transition is often not seamless and can be problematic for both the service provider and family, as developed relationships within the child’s service are family-centred and built on trust and respect. A variety of frameworks, models and approaches to care planning are available (Corkin et al., 2012) and a joint approach is commonly adopted when planning care for children i.e. Casey’s partnership model (Casey 1988) and the Roper Logan Tierney (2000) model of care; one is family-centred and the latter encompassing the 12 activities of living with the aim of care to move from dependence to independence.</p>
                        <p>An essential aspect of care planning is assessment. Chapter 22 discusses the commonly applied look, feel, and move approach with ‘ears’ that listen to the child and parent, underpinned by a holistic and family-centred approach. Family-centred care (FCC) recognises that the parent is a valued part of the child’s care team but should not to be taken for granted. Some parents adopt an ‘expert’ role when their child has complex needs. Examples of FCC include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Parental facilities: kitchen, shower and overnight facilities or purpose build parent accommodation.</li>
                            <li>One parent is routinely expected and welcomed in the anaesthetic and recovery room, the parent needs to be educated and supported by the nurse as an anaesthetised or recovering child can be upsetting for the parent.</li>
                            <li>One parent should be present during routine, painful and stressful procedures e.g. wound dressings, cast removal, venepuncture. The older child is given the choice. The rights of the child and consent are complex and challenging within all health care settings.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Adults</h3>
                        <p>At 18 years of age mentally competent adults are considered able to make all decisions in relation to their medical care providing they have the capacity to do so. This right does not diminish with age and all mentally competent adults have the right to refuse treatment even when it will clearly benefit them. The Mental Health Capacity Act (2005) introduced in England and Wales in 2007 permits courts to appoint a proxy decision maker who has power to grant consent to medical treatment if the patient becomes incapacitated.</p>
                        <p>For consent to be valid the person must have capacity, the consent must be voluntary and not be given under duress. Furthermore, the person must have received sufficient information upon which to base their decision. The person must also be able to communicate their decision. No adult is able to give consent for another adult. Here, ‘surgical, medical or dental treatment’ includes any procedure undertaken for the purposes of diagnosis and this section applies to any procedure (including, in particular, the administration of an anesthetic) which is ancillary to any treatment as it applies to that treatment.</p>
                        <h3>Young person: 16-17 years of age</h3>
                        <p>In many localities 16-17 yr olds are legally entitled to consent to their own medical treatment (without parental involvement). However, in certain circumstances they may not be permitted to refuse therapeutic care where they are at risk of suffering harm as a result of their decision.</p>
                        <h3>Young person: under 16 years of age</h3>
                        <p>A high profile test case of child consent (Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority 1985) saw Victoria Gillick attempting to set a legal precedent in England and Wales which would have meant that medical practitioners could not give young people under the age of 16 treatment or contraceptive services without parental permission. After Initial success, the House of Lords ruled that under-16s who are fully able to understand what is proposed, and its implications, are competent to consent to medical treatment regardless of age. This test case leads to ‘Gillick competence’, which states:</p>
                        <blockquote>(As a matter of law the parental right to determine whether or not their minor child below the age of 16 will have medical treatment terminates if and when the child achieves sufficient understanding and intelligence to enable him to understand fully what is proposed.)</blockquote>
                        <p>This also establishes that a child who is competent to consent to a course of treatment is entitled to the same obligation of confidentiality. Disclosures, however, need be considered against:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the young person’s right to privacy</li>
                            <li>the degree of current harm or likely harm</li>
                            <li>what any such disclosure is likely to achieve</li>
                            <li>what the potential benefits are to the young person’s wellbeing and, of course, the criminal law in this regard.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Those under 16 years may be able to consent if they are ‘Gillick competent’, meaning they have sufficient understanding and intelligence to make relevant decisions. In under 16s, parental involvement is desirable but not always essential (e.g. contraception) except where it is in the child’s best interests (e.g. sexual abuse). If a person with parental responsibility (PR) consents, they are subject to the same tests for capacity, duress and information as all adults. It is routine practice to gain consent from only one person with PR i.e. parent or guardian.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Childhood may require hospital admission and surgical intervention as a result of developmental disorders, disease or injury. The ‘total pain’ concept which considers the physical, psychological, spiritual and social aspects should be valued with the last three being met only after pain and related symptoms (e.g. anxiety) are controlled. Anxiety and fear are often overlooked or cause confusion for those caring for the child in pain. Chapter 11 concentrates on the fundamentals and exploration of orthopaedic and musculoskeletal trauma conditions. There is a need, however, to consider specific issues for the child in pain.</p>
                        <p>Pain is commonly experienced following surgery, but research highlights that pain is not always well controlled (Twycross 2007). It is well established that pain is an individual and subjective phenomenon, with three approaches commonly used in isolation or in combination to assess child pain i.e. self-report (what the child says); behavioural (how the child behaves) and physiological indicators (how the child’s body reacts). Self-report of pain intensity is a valuable source of information although there are many sources of bias and error (von Baeyer 2006). Children younger than five years of age can point to where they hurt but may be unable to accurately offer a reliable description of pain intensity due to age-related development (Twycross et al., 2009). Consequently, behavioural and physiological approaches are also commonly used. A one-dimensional approach is limited whereas multidimensional approaches promote optimal pain management. The child’s ability to describe pain increases with age and experience and changes throughout their development.</p>
                        <p>Pain assessment is central to successful management of pain. Commonly adopted child-specific assessment tools include the Wong and Baker (1988) six-point cartoon face rating scale (see Chapter 11 for further discussion of pain assessment tools). FLACC (Merkel et al., 1997) is an observer-rated pain scale for the nonverbal child. The abbreviation FLACC stands for face, legs, activity, crying and consolability. The FLACC pain scale was designed for children between the ages of two and seven years with McKay and Clarke (2012) recently reporting it suitable for children with a learning disability within the orthopaedic and trauma setting.</p>
                        <p>Pain management for children following orthopaedic trauma and surgery is further complicated by it commonly being difficult to obtain self-report of the pain experience of the child (Clarke 2003a). Such complexity has historically led to nurse-reporting of pain. Parents commonly adopt a central or supportive role when their child is too young to self-report their pain. However, parents’ and nurses’ judgements of facial expression or ‘how the patient looks’ mean that children’s pain is frequently underestimated (Goubet et al., 2009). Twycross et al. (2009) demonstrate that practices can be suboptimal when children are asked to report on how well their pain is managed. This problem may relate to nurses’ continuing belief in misconceptions about children’s pain; for example that a sleeping child cannot be in pain. There is evidence to suggest, however, that a sleeping child may, in fact, be exhausted because of persistent pain. If pain management is dependent solely on nurse-assessment then the outcome may be suboptimum. The role of the parent within the domain of family-centred care is deemed paramount (Corkin et al., 2012), with seminal and contemporary literature openly debating the value of the parent to score pain equal to the child post-surgery. The subjective nature of reporting pain severity and a reliance on the use of nurse and parent report when communication and cognition is absent, questions how effectively and consistently the documenting nurse and parent assess a child’s pain. Caution is advised due to the impact of fear and anxiety and not actual pain, alongside a need to identify pain location as the child could be reporting pain associated with, for example, their cannula. Children communicate their pain in many different ways; for example a child may ‘hide’ under their duvet, stop talking or become vocal, aggressive or ‘lash out’.</p>
                        <p>Misconceptions around children’s pain continue to impact upon practice, pain outcomes and wellbeing; these include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>neonates do not feel pain</li>
                            <li>children experience pain differently to/less than adults</li>
                            <li>children cannot express their pain</li>
                            <li>children do not remember pain</li>
                            <li>it is not safe to give children opiates due to the risk of respiratory depression.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Pain assessment is commonly considered the ‘fifth vital sign’ and undertaken as part of pre-existing clinical observations, blood pressure, pulse, respiration and temperature (von Baeyer 2006). (See Box 21.3 for examples of evidence related to pain assessment in children following orthopaedic surgery).</p>
                        
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span>Evidence digest: Childrens’, parents’ and nurses’ reports of pain following orthopaedic surgery</h4>
                            <p>An unpublished prospective exploratory study drew upon three convenience sample groups; the child, parent and attending nurse within an acute UK orthopaedic unit (Clarke 2003). Children were included (n=32) aged five to fifteen years old who were scheduled for an overnight admission following orthopaedic surgery. The sequence of data collection was nurse, child and parent. Each participating/attending nurse collected the pain scores on day one post-surgery between 10 and 11 am, with both scores blinded to parent and child. All three groups used the same modified ‘FACE’ rating pain assessment tool. Non-parametric testing found no statistical significance between the small sample groups of child, parent and nurse report of pain.</p>
                            <p>Statistically significant differences were, however, reported more recently by Rajasagaram et al. (2009) using a larger (n=86) sample of child, parent and nurse groups. Findings should be viewed with caution due to inappropriate testing i.e. a Mann Whitney U-test was used to test for difference in three groups instead of the recognised two (Connolly 2007). The small exploratory study undertaken by Clarke (2003) showed a statistically significant difference between boys and girls selfreporting of pain, with girls reporting a higher level of pain. A positive correlation was also found between parent- and nurse-report of child pain which would suggest parent/nurse agreement but not with the child. Interestingly Belville and Seupaul (2005) report a tradition of asking adults for information about the health status of children.</p>
                            <p>More recently, Twycross et al. (2007) completed a qualitative observational study of post-operative pain management practices in England. Thirteen registered nurses working in a surgical ward were observed continuously for a period of five hours per shift for two to four shifts. Data were collected for 36 shifts in total (185hours). The study involved children aged 0-16years. The nurses were observed administering pain relief when the child self-reported pain. They did not, however, routinely assess a child’s pain, nor use non-drug methods of pain relief on a regular basis. Reasons offered included a deficit in the nurses’ knowledge of pain and a lack of priority given to pain management. Parents were also not consistently encouraged to be involved in their child’s pain and on five occasions children’s behavioural cues were used as an indicator that a child was in pain, rather than appropriately assessing the child.</p>
                        </aside>

                        <p>Harrop (2007) suggests there is widespread inadequate prevention and relief of pain, supporting findings documented by the National Service Framework for Children in 2004. Conversely, Clarke and Richardson (2007) report on evolving practice that includes the recognition and deeper understanding of the child’s individual pain experience and the benefits of using an age-appropriate pain assessment tool that demonstrates validity and reliability and is taught preoperatively to the child (if possible) with parental involvement. Others include recent pharmacological advances such as intravenous (IV) paracetamol, continuous epidural infusions, caudal blocks and recognising the benefits of nonpharmacological interventions. Non-pharmacological options include behavioural and supportive methods such as information, empathy, belief and choices. Psychological treatment should be an integral part of orthopaedic and fracture trauma pain management with cognitive methods such as imagery and hypnosis potential options. Deep breathing and progressive relaxation should not be used in isolation for intense pain. Parents sometimes need to be given permission to touch and stroke their child.</p>
                        <p>Fear and anxiety management play key roles in children’s pain management and the nurse needs to take into account the stage of child development, cognitive abilities, gaining child and family trust and ensuring pain intensity is being measured and not the anxiety or fear. Influences on the pain experience for any child include past experiences, socialisation (how they see pain managed at home), personal values, cultural patterns and differences in assessment and intervention of pain (e.g. phobia of needles due to previous analgesic injections). Developments and innovative practice should be managed by a dedicated integrated multidisciplinary ‘pain team’ (Clarke 2003a) with the contribution of a children’s nurse educated in orthopaedics and fracture trauma. Pain management continues to challenge practitioners caring for children but particularly within orthopaedics and trauma as surgical intervention often produces pain of medium to severe intensity.</p>

                        <p>This section of the chapter aims to provide an overview of safeguarding plus the signs of child abuse and neglect. It will also identify the key government policies and guidelines which have been produced for all health professionals. The focus will be upon physical abuse as it is aligned to the field of orthopaedics and trauma with an emphasis on fractures in young children who present to emergency departments and surgical wards.</p>
                        <p>The case of Victoria Climbie has had a significant impact on children’s services in the UK over the last decade. Victoria suffered maltreatment at the hands of her great aunt and partner (Laming 2003). A wide range of agencies were involved and they missed opportunities to protect Victoria. Laming (2003) made multiple recommendations regarding assessment and observation, documentation and communication between all agencies and clearly stated that this was a lesson to be learned and never to happen again. But it did happen again; in August 2007 a 17-month old boy, ‘Baby P’, died having suffered fatal injuries at the hands of his mother and her boyfriend (Laming 2009). Baby P was visited 60 times by health and social care professionals and had been on the child protection register for nine months. There was a public outcry and a national review of child protection. The message was clear, it must not happen again.</p>
                        <p>During the period 2007-2012 a further 100 children have died in similar circumstances in the UK alone (www.nspcc.org.uk). These statistics show that the publishing of further guidelines to help health professionals to recognise, assess and protect children who may be at risk of significant harm appears, so far, to have had inadequate effect.</p>
                        <h3>Recognition of child abuse</h3>
                        <p>The categories of child abuse fall into the following areas:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>physical abuse</li>
                            <li>sexual abuse</li>
                            <li>emotional abuse</li>
                            <li>neglect.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All staff involved need to be alert to signs of child abuse and act accordingly, following the guidelines set out by government and professional bodies.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Physical abuse</h4>
                        <p>This type of abuse may involve hitting, slapping, throwing, burning or scalding, poisoning or suffocating the child resulting in injury or death of the infant or child. Signs and symptoms include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>bruising</li>
                            <li>broken bones</li>
                            <li>bites, scratches</li>
                            <li>burns, scalds</li>
                            <li>black eyes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Additional mediating factors include (Corkin et al., 2012):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>where there is delay in seeking medical attention</li>
                            <li>where there is conflicting history as to what has happened</li>
                            <li>where a pattern appears linked to recurrent injuries</li>
                            <li>where there is poor parental anxiety shown.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>NICE (2009) guidance suggests a focus on the concepts of ‘alerting features’, ‘consider’ or ‘suspect’:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Alerting features</strong> are symptoms, signs and patterns of injury or behaviour, which may indicate child abuse.</li>
                            <li><strong>Consider</strong> means that abuse is one possible explanation for an alerting feature (but there are other possible diagnoses).</li>
                            <li><strong>Suspect</strong> means there is a serious level of concern about abuse, but not proof. It may trigger a child protection investigation. This may lead to child protection procedures being put in place, offering the family more support or may lead to alternative explanations being found.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Fractures are a common manifestation of child abuse that may be found incidentally on X-rays ordered for another reason. A majority of non-accidental fractures occur in children under 18 months old. There are few genuine accidental fractures in this age group as fracture requires significant force in a child with normal bone development and does not occur during normal child care. Nurses are often one of the first to assess a child with an injury or fracture so they require a good level of knowledge of bone and child development.</p>
                        <p>When a child has a fracture, concerns are raised by the following issues:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>age/developmental level</strong> - fractures in non-ambulatory children are unusual</li>
                            <li><strong>location</strong> - metaphyseal, post-ribs, scapula, vertebrae and sternum fractures are highly suggestive of nonaccidental injury</li>
                            <li><strong>pattern</strong> - e.g. multiple fractures, complex skull fractures may suggest non-accidental injury</li>
                            <li><strong>age of injury</strong> - delay in seeking medical attention, fractures of different ages.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Eighty-five percent of fractures from non-accidental injury (NAI) occur in children under the age of three and 69% under the age of one year. Fractures under the age of one are highly associated with non-accidental trauma, as the infant would not have the ability to exert the force required to cause a fracture (Wade Shrader et al., 2011). Long bone fractures can be suggestive of NAI. Long bone fracture may present initially with a cry/scream, then the child may be irritable with decreased movement/use of limb and crying on movement of the affected area (i.e. changing, bathing) along with swelling. Fractures usually occur as a result of a twisting fall with foot planted – i.e. less force than expected. Fractures that occur due to traction/torsional forces can sometimes be attributed to forceful yanking, tugging which twisting which rarely occur accidentally and can suggest non-accidental injury.</p>
                        <p>Spiral humeral fractures and metaphyseal fractures of the distal femur and tibia are thought to be more likely to be caused by non-accidental injury (NAI). If an infant is pulled sharply, the corner of the metaphyseal region of the bone can be torn; this is referred to as ‘bucket handle’ fracture. Finding spiral fractures in a bone shaft is indicative of a twisting injury. Violent squeezing of the rib cage can result in anterior and posterior rib fractures which are difficult to acquire as children’s ribs are quite flexible. Additionally skull fractures such as linear fractures in the parietal bone are uncommon in a child under eighteen months and result from a direct force to the skull (refer to Chapter 24 for an evidence digest that highlights the incidence of non-accidental fractures in infants).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Assessment for non-accidental injury</h4>
                        <p>The assessments of children, following local and national guidance, are a fundamental part of recognising nonaccidental injury. Assessment frameworks set out to improve the quality of assessment and to assist in communicating the needs of children across all agencies involved. They also aim to avoid the escalation of a ‘child in need’ in relation to child protection through early identification and effective intervention. Guidance provides information to practitioners on how and when to refer a child to the dedicated child protection agency/ team. A detailed documented assessment can lead to action that ensures child protection is maintained. Throughout the process the child is the main focus and the child’s views must be listened to throughout. The family’s circumstances must also be considered; including their strengths, needs and potential risks, in order to make robust plans that can lead to improving the outcomes for the child. All practitioners must be aware of the assessment tool in use and be responsible for ensuring that the assessment process and subsequent action are carried out effectively and in a timely manner to ensure the safety of the child.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Role and responsibilities of practitioners</h4>
                        <p>All practitioners must be aware they have a role to play in recognising abuse or neglect in infants and children. They must work closely with other disciplines and act accordingly. They must place the interests of the child at the centre of their work and act on the child’s behalf if they have concerns (DES 2006). UK nurses, for example, must adhere to the Nursing and Midwifery Code of Conduct (2008) which states that (all nurses have duty and personal responsibility to act in the best interest of the child or young person, and to alert and to inform appropriate personnel if they suspect a child is at risk or has been abused.)</p>
                        <p>As well as having the skills of recognition and communication, all staff must have good record keeping and report writing skills. These must be clear, comprehensive, accurate, accessible, dated and signed in a chronological order (RCN 2007). The nurse’s responsibility around safe guarding children is summarised in Box 21.4.</p>

                        <p>The first chapter in this section highlights the needs of the child and family presenting with either an orthopaedic condition or fracture to be, ideally, cared for by a children’s nurse who has received post-qualifying education in orthopaedics and trauma. Key issues within this client group include challenges around assessment and planning care, informed consent, safeguarding, separation from parents, change of environment, anxiety and fear and the effective assessment and management of pain. Although similar to that of the adult, the team of health and non-health care professionals differs in placing family-centred care as an approach fundamental to good care outcomes for the child. In order to fully appreciate the wider context of caring for children within orthopaedic and fracture trauma the reader should review Chapters 22, 23 and 24 while taking into account the principles covered in this introductory chapter.</p>
