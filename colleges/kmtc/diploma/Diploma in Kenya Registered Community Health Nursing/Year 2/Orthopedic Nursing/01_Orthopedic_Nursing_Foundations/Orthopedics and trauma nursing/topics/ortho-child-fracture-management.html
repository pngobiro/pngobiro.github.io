                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Children are not small adults but ‘different’ due to their state of development and growth, resulting in physiological differences between the child and adult skeleton. The growing skeleton has an enormous capacity for more rapid healing and remodelling. Injuries that involve skeletal growth plates can potentially cause permanent growth irregularities. Children sustain more fractures than healthy adults (Jones et al., 2002) and Schalamon et al. (2011) estimated that 10% to 25% of all children’s injuries worldwide will be fractures. In a study of 3421 children’s fractures 34.7% were sport related, 17.6% occurred at home and 16.7% happened outdoors. The incidence of childhood fractures varies across the age spectrum. This is influenced by a child’s physical mobility, language development, their comprehension of danger, ability to identify risk in their immediate environment and more adventurous behaviour with age. The principles of fracture management are considered in Chapter 17 while this chapter, along with Chapter 24, focusses specifically on fractures in the infant, child and young person.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The pre-ambulant child</h3>
                        <p>The pre-ambulant child, newborn to around 13 months of age, is dependent and vulnerable with crying the only means of communication. This can sometimes seem relentless and frustrating for carers. This age group has minimal capacity to place themselves in danger; therefore, for any child from this age group presenting with a fracture, there should be a high index of suspicion for non-accidental injury (Clarke et al., 2012). Skellern et al. (2000) report 24% of fractures in children under one year of age to be due to non-accidental injury. It is essential that practitioners working with this age group always obtain a full medical history and seek continuity between the mechanism of injury and the actual injury (Clarke et al., 2012) (see Chapter 21 for further discussion). Accidents that do happen are often attributed to unexpected mobility by the child, for example the first time a baby independently rolls over and falls from a surface or unexpectedly crawling and falling down stairs. Other accidents are inadvertently caused by the child’s carer; for example dropping the child while carrying them or placing a child seat on a high surface from which it can fall. It is known that pre-school age children are most likely to sustain fractures in the home environment (Majori et al., 2009) and there is a role here for parental/carer education in accident prevention.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The pre-school child</h3>
                        <p>Pre-school children, aged 13 months to five years of age, are gradually becoming independently mobile. They are inquisitive about their environment and need to interact with things in order to learn. It is in their nature to be impetuous, excitable, trusting, naïve and quick. However, they have little knowledge of what can potentially harm them. Language skills are developing but they may not fully comprehend instructions. For those three to five years of age the most likely reason for emergency department attendance for 1 to 2 year olds is accidental poisoning followed by musculoskeletal injury (Orton et al., 2012). Valerio et al. (2010) researched paediatric fracture patterns in 382 subjects and found that 19.9% of pre-school children sustained a fracture, 83% of these injuries were to the upper limb, there was no gender difference and 68% of the fractures occurred in the home environment.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The school aged child</h3>
                        <p>School age children, aged five to twelve years, continue to interact with the environment and gradually form some independence. It is at this age they start to play outside away from direct supervision. Their understanding of risk is developing but is still limited. They form friendships and may start to engage in risk taking behaviours to impress their friends. Language comprehension has developed and instructions can be followed unless the child chooses to be disobedient. This is reflected in the injury patterns for this age group. Most injuries still occur in the home (46%) but 28% of fractures are sustained at playgrounds and 18% at sports facilities (Valerio et al., 2010). Children are seen with injuries that relate to trends in their play activities such as skating (Ruth et al., 2009), trampolining and skateboards (Lustenberger et al., 2010). It is important to look at these trends and consider health and safety initiatives to help reduce the number of fractures that children sustain such as the type of surfaces in playgrounds (Howard et al., 2009). Such initiatives have health benefits but are also important because school attendance is reduced when a child has a limb immobilised in a cast (Hymen 2011) and this may impact on their education. Young children often don’t pay attention and are at particular risk of injury from road traffic accidents (Doong and Lai, 2012; Dunbar 2012). Children at the younger end of this age group are short in stature and have small body mass, rendering them more vulnerable to significant injury if involved in a road traffic accident. Often the child is a pedestrian, possibly playing in the street or on a bike, and because of their smaller size they are harder to see, the main trunk of their body comes into contact with the vehicle and they can be thrown further. Even at slow speeds the child involved in a road traffic accident is likely to sustain more significant injuries.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The young person/adolescent</h3>
                        <p>Adolescents are known for being adventurous and engaging in risk-taking behaviours. Many are thrill seeking, attention seeking, respond to peer pressure and confidently believe that they are indestructible. Most adolescents have adult appearance but it is important to remember that they have not fully reached skeletal maturity. Wang et al. (2010) suggest the higher fracture incidence in this age group is related to the very rapid pubertal growth spurt that weakens the bone cortex. Mathison and Agrawal (2010) attribute the recent increase in the number of paediatric fractures to the emergence of more adventurous sporting activities that appeal to this age group. Most adolescent fractures are sustained when participating in contact sports such as rugby and football or more adventurous activities like skiing and mountain biking (Aleman and Meyers 2010).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Childhood skeletal growth</h3>
                        <p>Skeletal formation commences in the embryo and continues until skeletal growth is complete at around 21 years of age. Before eight weeks gestation the foetal skeleton is formed entirely of fibrous membranes and hyaline cartilage. Two types of bone tissue development occur: intramembranous ossification when bone develops from a fibrous membrane and is called membranous bone and endochondral ossification when bone develops from hyaline cartilage and is called cartilage or endochondral bone. Interstitial growth at the epiphyseal plates or physes lengthens bone and appositional growth widens bones. During bone lengthening the epiphyseal plate cartilage that abuts the diaphysis produces new cartilaginous cells that transit towards the diaphysis and then form new bone. Appositional growth occurs along the periosteum. Osteoblasts form new bone on the inner side of the periosteum whilst osteoclasts erase bone along the outer edge of the endosteum. Osteoblast formation is more prolific than osteoclast activity. The end result is a thicker and stronger bone shaft and a widening medullary canal in proportion to the bone diameter. Bone growth is said to be complete when the epiphyseal plates fuse. Growth of the young child’s femoral head demonstrates this. Figure 23.1 shows a series of radiographic images of the hip illustrating development from birth to skeletal maturity.</p>
                        
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        
                        <p>At birth the femoral head is a cartilaginous template that is not evident on X-ray. By eight months of age the ossific nuclei of the femoral head (secondary centre of ossification) is evident. At around eight years of age the femoral heads are fully formed, with the epiphyseal plate (physis) clearly evident. At skeletal maturity the physis of the proximal femur is fused.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Bone repair and remodelling</h3>
                        <p>Bone repair and remodelling occurs throughout life. Remodelling is controlled in two ways:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A hormonal negative feedback mechanism in which parathyroid hormone and calcitonin control the blood calcium concentration. When blood calcium concentration falls, parathyroid hormone stimulates osteoblasts to release calcium from the skeleton. When blood calcium levels rise the thyroid gland releases calcitonin that stimulates the calcium to be deposited into bone. Calcium is essential for many physiological processes and this mechanism exists to maintain the blood calcium level rather than assist with skeletal wellbeing.</li>
                            <li>A response to mechanical stress. A bone grows or remodels according to the forces or demands made of it (Wolff’s law). Bones are thicker and stronger at the points of maximum weight bearing and muscle attachment/pull. Long bones are thickest mid shaft, curved bones are thickest at the bend point and form bony projections for muscle attachment (i.e. neck of femur), spongy bone forms struts (bony bridges) along areas of compression. Thus the negative feedback mechanism controls when remodelling occurs and mechanical stresses control where remodelling occurs (see Chapter 4 for musculoskeletal structure and development).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Fracture healing in the child fundamentally follows the same process as in adults (Chapter 17) with some differences. Younger children have a greater capacity for fracture remodelling and so angulated and/or displaced fractures can be treated conservatively. After initial callus formation more bone is laid down in the plane with the greatest mechanical stress. As a general rule fractures within the sagittal plane remodel well whereas fractures with axial rotation are unlikely to remodel. In adults similar injuries would require surgical correction. Figure 23.2 provides a pictorial overview of the healing process.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_15_e59ad744ad7bac926a7cg-331-1.jpg" alt="Series of three X-rays showing the progression of fracture remodeling in a femur over eight months, from new injury to healed bone." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Figure 23.2 Series of X-rays to show fracture remodelling in a femur. 23.2a new injury; 23.2b two months post-injury; 23.2c eight months post-injury</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Children have a growing skeleton; consequently fracture healing is faster in children than adults. It is estimated that a two-year old will heal a long bone fracture in three weeks whereas a ten-year old will take three months and children have a greater capacity for fracture remodelling. When managing children’s fractures it is acceptable for the fracture fragments not to be in true alignment and/or have some degree of angulation. It is important to know the age of the child and the injury. The younger the child the faster the healing capacity and the greater the remodelling capacity.</p>
                        <p>Vitamin D is essential for calcium homeostasis and thus affects bone development and remodelling. This is considered in more detail in Chapter 22. The practitioner should consider assessing the vitamin D level of children that present with repeat fractures and when considering the possibility of non-accidental injury.</p>

                        <h3>Osteogenesis imperfecta</h3>
                        <p>Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic skeletal dysplasia in which the skeleton is osteoporotic (Cole 2002). It is clinically manifested in tissues in which type I collagen is the principal matrix protein: bone, dentin, sclera and ligaments. It is described as dominant or recessive. In dominant OI there is a protein defect that affects type I collagen formation. Either there is a reduction in the amount of collagen manufactured by the body or there is a reduction in the amount of collagen mixed with some defective collagen (Cole 2002). In recessive OI genetic mutations cause deficiency in the collagen components. Both dominant and recessive forms result in reduced bone mass and strength, making the bone fragile and susceptible to fracture, deformity and growth deficiency (Forlino et al., 2011). The condition is rare, affecting around six per 100000 of the population (van Dijk et al., 2011). Its clinical presentation ranges from silent forms with osteoporosis to intrauterine death.</p>
                        <p>Children with OI usually present with a fracture from a low impact injury, multiple or sequential fractures that may be in different stages of union and a family history of ‘easy’ fractures and/or bone disease. Fractures often heal with abundant callus. Abnormal reparative bone may give rise to malunion or pseudarthrosis. Children with more severe forms of OI tend to present earlier and with more numerous fractures. Fracture incidence decreases after puberty. Other main musculoskeletal features are short stature, pectus excavatum, kyphoscoliosis and Wormian bone. Kyphoscoliosis occurs in 40-60% of cases and may be progressive after maturity. In Wormian bone small independent areas of primary ossification are seen within membranous bone on X-ray, most often seen on a skull X-ray. Alteration of the tissues containing type I collagen also causes dentinogenesis imperfecta, blue sclera and ligamentous laxity.</p>
                        <p>OI is classified in to four types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The mildest form is type 1, these patients have blue sclera, bone fragility varies from mild to severe; dentinogenesis imperfecta may be present.</li>
                            <li>Type 2 is the severest form of OI. It is incompatible with life and usually results in intrauterine death. Babies rarely survive the neonatal period and there is extreme bone fragility with crumpled long bones.</li>
                            <li>In type 3 bone fragility is variable, being more severe in infancy; skeletal deformity is progressive with blue sclera.</li>
                            <li>In type 4 OI there is bone fragility, normal sclera with variable skeletal deformity and dentin abnormality.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>OI is difficult to diagnose; 20.5% of children with OI are initially diagnosed as non-accidental injury (Pandya et al., 2011).</p>
                        <p>Children with OI should be managed by the multidisciplinary team. Systemic management aims to improve skeletal strength. A group of drugs called bisphosphonates may be prescribed. These decrease osteoclast activity to improve the mineral content of bone (van Dijk et al., 2011) with the intention of decreasing fracture risk. Calcium, vitamins C and D, fluoride and calcitonin are used to try and strengthen the bone with growth hormone used in an attempt to correct short stature.</p>
                        <p>Management aims to maximise independent mobility by minimising disability that can result from fractures and skeletal deformity. OI is a chronic condition and requires long-term routine therapy. This consists of physiotherapy and hydrotherapy to maintain muscle control and strength. Lightweight orthotics are used to support limbs and prevent deformity and spinal braces to control kyphoscoliosis. Custom made seating is provided for non-ambulators. Parents and carers need to be taught proper handling and positioning to avoid fractures. It is preferable that fractures are treated conservatively and are immobilised in lightweight casts for short durations to allow for early motion. Prolonged immobilisation results in further osteoporosis leading to repeat fractures.</p>
                        <p>Surgery can be used to stabilise skeletal deformity. Options include intramedullary nailing of the long bones, with or without correctional osteotomies, or using telescopic rods that are fixed in the epiphysis and elongate with the bone during growth. Stabilisation aims to improve bone alignment, decrease the risk of refracture and improve rehabilitation. Spinal fusion is recommended for curves over 35 degrees but surgical fixation is complicated by the poor bone quality and the lack of autogenous bone graft. It is important to remember that patients with OI have the tendency to bleed excessively.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Fractures in children with special needs</h3>
                        <p>Children with special needs are at increased risk of pathological fractures because of low bone mineral density. Many have a decreased weight bearing status that contributes to osteoporosis (Marreiros et al., 2010), require parenteral nutrition because of poor gastrointestinal absorption that affects their nutritional status, may have epilepsy and need anti-convulsant drugs that have been shown to lower bone mineral density (GniatkowskaNowakowska 2010) and/or underlying pathology such as osteomyelitis that affects skeletal strength (Belthur et al., 2012) or neurofibromatosis. Some syndromes (e.g. Turner’s syndrome) have a known association with increased fracture risk but the physiology is not yet fully understood (Holroyd et al., 2010).</p>
                        <p>There is a tri-partite approach to caring for the disabled child with a fracture. The main principles of fracture management apply, pain control and limb immobilisation, conservative or surgical treatment appropriate for the underlying pathology and the child’s ability to manage the suggested treatment. Traction may be a preferable treatment. Early mobilisation is preferable, splints and braces may be more appropriate than casts and all need to be lightweight. Many children with special needs are at greater risk of pressure ulcers due immobility, neurological deficit, nutritional issues and fragile skin. This must be considered when prescribing immobilisation devices.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Pathological fractures</h3>
                        <p>Some fractures are pathological in origin. This means that there is underlying disease or alteration of the biochemistry of the bone that predisposes it to fracture. There can be many causes; malnutrition, neurophysiological disorders that affect the musculoskeletal system, osteomyelitis, skeletal syndromes and dysplasias, bone cysts and tumours. Bone chemistry is altered and bone density is reduced. Pharmacological regimes used to treat other conditions can affect the bone density, (e.g. epilepsy drugs and chemotherapy).</p>
                        <p>To complicate matters, when a child presents with a fracture without clear evidence of injury the practitioner must consider non-accidental injury (NAI) but must also be mindful of pathological causes. Each hospital must have sound child protection procedures/safeguarding in place and designated child protection specialists. The practitioner needs to know and follow the local child protection guidelines if there is any concern about the mechanism of the injury. Sadly, this is especially significant as reported child maltreatment continues to rise (Gilbert et al., 2012). The consequences of not identifying child abuse are severe with 50% presenting with further injury and 10% dying from abuse. See Chapter 21 for further discussion of safeguarding children.</p>
                        <p>The first priority when managing a child with a pathological fracture is to diagnose the cause (Saraph and Linhart 2005). Attempting to treat the fracture without understanding the pathological cause is largely futile. If a child has osteomyelitis, then the fracture will not heal until the infection has been appropriately treated. Expediency is also key. A pathological fracture from a bone lesion diagnosed on X-ray, may have resulted from a simple bone cyst or an osteosarcoma of which the latter is life threatening. Initial principles of fracture management apply, pain control and limb immobilisation but further management is dependent on the underlying diagnosis (Chapter 15).</p>

                        <p>The principles of diagnosis, classification and management of fractures in the adult are considered in a previous chapter. For the sake of completeness in this chapter an overview of fracture care in children are also considered here with some overlap but the reader may also wish to refer to Chapter 17.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>A fracture is described as a disruption of bone continuity and is most often the result of accidental trauma. On initial presentation the child experiences pain, swelling and loss of function of the affected limb, although in stable undisplaced fractures not all these criteria may be present. It is important to obtain a full medical history, complete a clinical examination and obtain an X-ray to assist with diagnosis. Not all fractures are clearly evident on X-ray and it may be necessary to use other forms of imaging to clarify the injury, such as MRI (magnetic resonance image) or CT (computerised tomography).</p>
                        <p>The medical history should identify how the injury happened, the age of the child and the age of the injury. Information about the mechanism of injury will allow for any concerns regarding non-accidental injury to be considered and, hopefully, ruled out. Information about the velocity and impact of injury can give vital information. If a fracture that is normally associated with a high impact injury, for example fractured femur, occurred as a result of low impact then the clinician should be suspicious of a pathological fracture and further investigations are needed. If the child has been involved in major trauma (i.e. road traffic accident) then the clinician must consider the possibility of other injuries (Chapter 16).</p>
                        <p>Fractures can be diagnosed clinically. The main indices are pain, swelling and loss of function. Palpation over the suspected site of injury will be uncomfortable if there is an underlying fracture. Assessment of the limb must include assessment for neurovascular deficit/compartment syndrome (Wright 2007b). Radiological imaging is used to confirm the diagnosis of a fracture. Initially an X-ray is obtained. It is important to obtain two views - anterior-posterior and lateral. The body is three dimensional and thus one X-ray view may not show evidence of fracture. If an X-ray does not illustrate a fracture but there is a high index of clinical suspicion, then other imaging such as an oblique X-ray view, MRI or CT may be requested. MRIs show the soft tissues and CTs provide better definition of bones. Also if the injury is complex, for example a triplane fracture of ankle - which as the name suggests is a three dimensional injury, then further imaging is requested so that the surgeon can have a full understanding of the injury.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Fracture classification</h3>
                        <p>Fractures are generally classified as closed or open injuries, by the anatomical location, the direction of fracture line, the level of the fracture within the bone, as a description of the fracture pattern and, if the injury involves the growth plate, using the growth plate classification called Salter Harris. There is a detailed and, complex fracture classification system for long bones called the AO system of long bone fracture classification (Müller at al., 1990); a further version was created for paediatric long bone fractures by Slongo and Audigé (2007).</p>
                        <p>In closed fractures the skin surrounding the fracture is intact. If a fracture is described as open then the skin has been punctured and the skin integrity has been compromised. In this instance there is a high risk of infection especially as debris from the scene of the incident may be embedded inside the bone and surrounding tissues. This is also known as a compound fracture and the bone may be protruding from the skin. Haemorrhage is likely with an open fracture.</p>
                        <p>Primary fracture description involves identifying the fractured bone, for example fractured left tibia or fractured right metacarpal of index finger. The anatomical reference points are used to describe the level of the fracture i.e. diaphysis, epiphysis. The Salter Harris classification system is used to describe fractures that involve the physis (Chapter 24). The fracture is then further described by the direction of the fracture line: transverse, linear, oblique or spiral as demonstrated in Figure 23.3. In a transverse fracture the fracture line crosses the shaft of the bone at a right angle to the bone’s long axis. In a linear fracture the fracture line is parallel along the bone’s long axis. In an oblique fracture the fracture line is diagonal and in a spiral fracture the fracture line twists around the long axis of the bone. Other terms used to describe fractures are impacted, comminuted and avulsed. Impacted fractures occur when the bone fragments are driven into each other. In comminuted or multi-fragment fractures the bone has broken into a number of fragments. With an avulsion fracture the muscle that attaches to the bone via a tendon has been pulled away by sudden contraction of the muscle. The sudden and forceful muscle contraction results in a fragment of bone being pulled off from the bone. The levels of the fracture site are also used in fracture description: proximal, mid shaft and distal, Figure 23.4 applies these terms to the femur.</p>

                        <p>It is also described as the proximal third, middle third or distal third. Terms that describe the fracture pattern are also used. A hairline fracture is a thin, fine fracture where there is no clear evidence of fracture on X-ray but clinical indices are high. Depressed fractures are inwardly displaced, often caused by a direct blow. Intraarticular fractures involve part of the joint surface. Pathological fracture occurs when the bone is weakened by disease and fractures with minimal force.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Fractures unique to childhood</h3>
                        <p>Buckle fractures and greenstick fractures are unique to children. The juvenile skeleton has thicker periosteum and this partially protects the bone from injury when a high impact force is sustained, reducing the severity of the fracture. The result is an incomplete ‘buckle’ or ‘greenstick’ fracture. The term buckle refers to the buckling of the bone without disturbing the whole bone. This is also known as a torus fracture, from the Latin word ‘tori’ meaning swelling or protuberance. Buckle fractures most commonly occur in the distal radius, typically when a child falls on an outstretched hand. These fractures can be successfully treated using a temporary removable wrist splint (Wright 2011). The term greenstick fracture describes a fracture in which one cortex of the bone is broken and the other cortex is intact. These fractures are treated conservatively, by immobilising in a cast because angulation can occur at the fracture site due to the asymmetry of the fracture (Chapter 24).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Growth plate injuries</h3>
                        <p>Fractures that include the epiphyseal plate are classified using the Salter Harris (SH) classification. This classification describes the physeal injury and appoints a number to each type. The gradient is from one to five; a Salter Harris 5 injury is the severest injury and poses the greatest likelihood of an angulatory deformity or bone length discrepancy. Salter Harris classification and management is further explored in Chapter 24.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Potential diagnostic pitfalls</h3>
                        <p>The altered physiology of the child’s skeleton complicates diagnosing children’s fractures. The cartilaginous component of the child’s skeleton does not show on X-ray and may result in the true extent of the injury not being appreciated. This is particularly true of SH1 and fractures of the lateral condyle of the humerus. A Salter Harris 1 fracture of long bone presents with the fracture line traversing the physis; a child’s physis is cartilage and will therefore not be evident on radiological imaging (Gaston et al., 2012). Similarly, the physis of the lateral condyle of the humerus is the last growth plate in the elbow to fuse - at around 13 years of age - making radiological diagnosis difficult. This is particularly significant because there is a high incidence of non-union (Storm et al., 2006). These injuries are usually treated conservatively (Marcheix et al., 2011) but, due to the risk of non-union, some surgeons prefer to treat them surgically with fracture reduction and K wire fixation. Either way, children with these injuries should be followed up in the outpatient clinic until fracture healing has been confirmed radiologically.</p>
                        <p>Hairline or stress fractures are not always evident radiologically. These injuries are usually the result of minor trauma or repeated stress (e.g. when participating in sports). Mostly they are stable fractures that will heal well, but the scaphoid is an exception. Scaphoid fractures usually occur in the adolescent (Bhatti et al., 2012) and have a high incidence of painful non-union (Eastley et al., 2012). If there is clinical suspicion of a scaphoid fracture, the limb should be immobilised in a cast. Further imaging by MRI is recommended to aid diagnosis (Yin et al., 2012). Once the cast is removed the child is reviewed in clinic until there is radiological evidence of fracture healing and the patient is symptom free.</p>
                        <p>Overlooking these injuries can result in deformity and disability. If there is a clinical suspicion of a fracture, even if the injury is not confirmed on X-ray, the limb should be immobilised and further imaging requested to confirm or refute the diagnosis. Furthermore, children’s ligaments are stronger than bone which makes it rare for a child to sustain a ‘strain’ or ‘sprain’. When a child presents, for example, with ankle pain and a history of trauma with no evidence of fracture on X-ray, the practitioner should suspect SH type 1 fracture and take appropriate action.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Joint dislocations</h3>
                        <p>Joint dislocations occur with high impact events, usually sport related. The two bones that constitute a joint are completely displaced from one another. There is no articulation and the joint cannot function. Subluxation is a variance of this where the two bones are partially dislocated but some contact is maintained. Dislocation of joints most commonly occur in the shoulder and the patella. Treatment involves manipulating the bones back into the correct position followed by a period of immobilisation then gradual rehabilitation with physiotherapy to strengthen the musculature that supports the joints.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Fracture dislocations</h3>
                        <p>Fracture dislocations are a complex group of injuries where a joint is dislocated alongside a fracture. These injuries usually require surgical reduction but can be difficult to reduce and may be unstable. Children with these injuries require close supervision as joint stiffness and avascular necrosis are common complications. An uncommon but unique fracture dislocation in children is the Monteggia fracture. This is a fracture dislocation in which a fracture of the proximal ulna is coupled with dislocation of the radial head (Beutal 2012). While the ulna fracture is usually identified, the radial head dislocation is sometimes initially overlooked (Babb and Carlson 2005). This can cause a valgus deformity of the elbow, restriction of forearm rotation and pain with activity (Bhaskar 2009). With all ulna fractures the position of the radial head should be confirmed. Surgical reduction of a displaced ulna fracture is needed with which the radial head spontaneously reduces (Ring et al., 1998).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Articular fractures</h3>
                        <p>If the fracture extends into a joint surface it is classified as an articular fracture. Two descriptions are used; ‘complete’ and ‘partial’. In a complete articular fracture the joint line is completely separated. These injuries can also be considered fracture dislocations. In partial articular fractures, also described as intra-articular, part of the joint is separated. The significance of these injuries is that there is usually residual joint stiffness and they can predispose to early osteoarthritis.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Main principles of fracture treatment</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The priorities of initial fracture management are to ensure that the neurovascular status of the limb is healthy and that there are no indications of compartment syndrome (Wright 2008a), relieve pain and support the injured limb. The aim of secondary management is to ensure the bone ends are in continuity so that healing can occur without residual deformity and the limb is restored to full normal function. Fractures can be treated conservatively using casts, splintage or traction. If the fracture is displaced then surgical correction is required; this ranges from manipulation under anaesthetic to open reduction with either internal or external fixation (refer to Chapters 8 and 17).</p>
                        <h3>Casting</h3>
                        <p>Casts made of plaster of Paris (POP) or resin can be used to support and align fractured limbs. Plaster of Paris casts are easier to mould by the clinician but are heavier and take longer to dry. Resin casts dry within 30 minutes, are available in different colours and are lightweight. The purpose of casting is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>to maintain bone alignment for fracture healing</li>
                            <li>to maintain surgical correction until healed</li>
                            <li>to promote pain relief by resting the affected limb or joint</li>
                            <li>to correct deformities by wedging or serial casting.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Casts should always be applied by a suitably qualified practitioner. There are three layers:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>stockinette to protect the skin</li>
                            <li>wool to add padding and further protection</li>
                            <li>the casting material.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Each layer should be applied smoothly, to avoid creasing that may cause pressure sore, and snugly, to support and mould the cast to the limb (Wright 2008b).</p>
                        <p>After application the plaster will feel warm due to chemical reaction. The wet cast should be handled by the palm of the hand to avoid cast denting that may cause pressure. The cast should be allowed to dry naturally. Casts can conduct heat and resting a casted limb on a radiator or using a hair drier may cause a burn. The affected limb should be elevated to reduce swelling so the limb should be rested/elevated on pillows covered with a towel to absorb the moisture from the cast. Children in large body casts should be turned two hourly to facilitate drying of the cast. The practitioner should observe the cast for dents, cracks or skin rubbing and assess the patient for complaints of pain or discomfort. If any of these are noted then medical staff should be informed. It may be necessary to modify or remove the cast (Wright 2008). See Chapter 8 for further information.</p>
                        <p>When discharged the child and family should be advised to keep the cast dry. It should not be covered with plastic for showering or bathing as steam condenses on the inside of plastic bags and will make the cast wet. The best advice is to cover the cast with a towel to absorb water splashes. Nothing should be put down the cast because of the risk of developing pressure ulcers and nothing should be used to scratch under the cast as the skin may be lacerated and there is a risk of subsequent infection. The family should be advised to avoid beaches and sandpits to prevent sand getting inside the cast that can rub the skin and cause excoriation (Wright 2007a).</p>
                        <p>The patient should be advised to observe for the following and to seek medical assistance should any of the following signs and symptoms occur. (Lucus and Davis 2005):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the toes or fingers become blue, swollen and painful to move</li>
                            <li>the limb becomes more painful</li>
                            <li>pins and needles or numbness are felt in the digits</li>
                            <li>if the cast feels uncomfortable or is rubbing</li>
                            <li>if an unpleasant smell is noticed from the cast and/or a discharge is seen on the cast.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Orthotic splints</h3>
                        <p>Orthotic splints are used in the management of fractures to immobilise and rest a limb. They are particularly useful when a child has underlying pathology and traditional treatment such as casting may do more harm than good. Orthotic splints are either dynamic or fixed. A fixed splint is rigid and will support and control the limb and/or correct deformity (Wright 2012); for example, removable wrist splints used in the management of buckle fractures (Wright 2011). Dynamic splints support the limb but allow for a controlled range of movement that can help soft tissue development and healing (Wright 2012). The IROM brace is an example of a dynamic splint; following patellar dislocation it is used to allow controlled knee flexion.</p>
                        <h3>Traction</h3>
                        <p>Traction is a pulling force that is applied to an injured limb using weights and pulleys. This is considered in more detail in Chapter 8 but is considered briefly here for the sake of completeness of this chapter. Traction is applied superficially to the limb with the force being indirectly exerted on the underlying structures:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In fixed traction the traction force is exerted against a fixed point (e.g. Thomas splint traction).</li>
                            <li>In balanced traction the traction pull is exerted against an opposing force usually provided by the weight of the body when the foot of the bed is raised.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are three types of traction; skin, skeletal and manual.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In skin traction the traction apparatus is applied directly to the patient’s skin.</li>
                            <li>In skeletal traction the traction pull is exerted via pins, screws, wires or tongs that have been surgically applied to the skeleton (e.g. Steinman pin through the tibia).</li>
                            <li>Manual traction is applied by a person pulling on the affected limb, used during traction application and fracture manipulation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Traction is used in fracture treatment to restore and maintain fracture alignment and to assist with pain relief by controlling muscle spasm. Different types of traction are used according the injury (Table 23.1) and is described in more detail in chapter 8.</p>

                        <h3>Surgical management</h3>
                        <p>Surgical management falls into four categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>closed reduction</li>
                            <li>closed reduction with surgical pinning</li>
                            <li>open reduction with or without internal fixation</li>
                            <li>external fixation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Closed reduction is achieved by manipulating the fracture while the patient is anaesthetised. With general anaesthetic the muscles are relaxed and the patient is unaware of pain allowing the surgeon to manipulate the fracture ends back to anatomical position. This is used when the fracture is minimally displaced. First manual traction is applied, pulling the limb distally. This corrects limb shortening and often, because the muscles are relaxed from the general anaesthetic, this may be enough to correct the bone alignment. The next step is to push or angulate the bone ends until reduction is achieved. Alignment is radiologically confirmed in theatre and a cast is applied. If the fracture position slips, percutaneous Kirschner wires (K wires) are inserted across the fracture site. After confirmation of alignment by X-ray a back slab cast is applied. The K wires loosen in the bone over the next few weeks and are normally removed four to six weeks after insertion. There is a best practice debate about whether the K wires should be removed in the outpatient clinic or as a day case procedure under general anaesthesia. Removing the K wires in a clinic takes a few seconds and is slightly uncomfortable, although the sight of the pliers used to remove the wires can be frightening. To have the wires removed in theatre means having to fast the child and it carries the risks of general anaesthesia. The practitioner should discuss this with the child and family. As a general rule, if the child is under eight years of age the K wires should be removed under general anaesthesia and in the clinic if older.</p>
                        <h4>Open reduction and internal fixation</h4>
                        <p>Open reduction is used if satisfactory fracture reduction has not been achieved with closed reduction or the best way to achieve fracture alignment is to expose the fracture to allow reduction under direct vision with or without internal fixation. If the injury is an open fracture then the site is already exposed and further surgical opening may be needed to fully debride the wound and apply the necessary internal fixation. With open fractures there is added complication of poor skin integrity. It may not be possible to surgically close the wound and plastic surgery may be needed. Internal fixation secures the anatomical alignment and is beneficial for complex injuries such as intra-articular or fracture dislocation.</p>
                        <p>A variety of devices can be used for internal fixation, screws, plates, wires, nails and tension sutures. Internal fixation may be beneficial in major trauma, stabilising the limb injuries and allowing focus on more life threatening aspects of the patient’s care. It also allows for early mobilisation. This may be particularly beneficial to a child with special needs. To internally fix a fracture the surgery is more invasive with the possibility of infection and the child will be under general anaesthesia for longer.</p>
                        <h4>External fixation</h4>
                        <p>External fixation is particularly useful when managing open and/or comminuted fractures. Pins are inserted percutaneously into the bone above and below the fracture site. The pins are then attached to a rigid external frame and the fracture ends can then be brought into alignment by manipulation of the frame. When there is severe soft tissue damage, the external fixator allows the fracture to be stabilised whilst the skin can be accessed for wound management. External circular frames such as the Ilizarov and Taylor spatial frame use wires that are thinner than pins and can be placed in individual bone fragments for comminuted fractures. External fixators are visible, there is a risk of pin site infection and the patient needs to be involved in pin site care (see Chapter 8 for further detail).</p>

                        <p>Infection can delay fracture healing. The more interventional the management strategy employed to stabilise the fracture the greater the risk of infection. Sometimes there is delayed healing that proceeds to non-union. Non-union in otherwise healthy children is rare but can happen if fibrous tissue is within the fracture. Smoking and poor diet can contribute to delayed or non-union. It is known that certain fractures, of the scaphoid for instance, are at risk of non-union due to poor vasculature of the scaphoid bone. Mal-union occurs when the fracture ends have united in a suboptimal anatomical position. It is unusual in children and the management depends on the presenting clinical deformity and effect on function.</p>
