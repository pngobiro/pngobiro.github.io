                        <p>Up to 25% of all childhood injuries are fractures (Rennie et al., 2007). The aim of this chapter is to provide evidence-based guidance for the most common fractures in children and adolescents, the mechanism of injury and the typical management and treatment. As a child grows they become more involved in sport, have further freedom and the incidence of fracture increases (Hooton and Scott 2006). A child’s musculoskeletal system and the biomechanical composition of children’s bones are different to adults. These differences affect how children’s fractures occur and are managed. Differences reduce as a child grows, especially as they reach adolescence (Hart et al., 2006a). Fractures in children tend to heal much more rapidly than in adults as their growth plates/physis are open. This results in shorter periods of immobility and less stiffness. Mal-union and non-union occur rarely with children also having great potential for remodelling and reshaping of bone after a fracture heals (Berg 2005).</p>
                        <p>The factors that need to be considered when assessing children with fractures include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>age of the child</li>
                            <li>mechanism of injury</li>
                            <li>location of fracture</li>
                            <li>any potential complications</li>
                            <li>possibility of physeal injury</li>
                            <li>continuing bone growth</li>
                            <li>the possibility of non-accidental injury.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The inclusion of the family in the child’s care and awareness of family circumstances also need to be considered.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Children are at risk of physeal (growth plate) injuries until bone growth is complete. In boys this is age 18 years approximately and girls two years after the beginning of puberty (Lipp 1998). These injuries are common during periods of active growth and more common in boys due to their sporting activities. Injury to the upper limb is more common with the distal radius most affected (Lipp 1998). See Figures 24.1 and 24.2 for examples of growth plate injuries.</p>

                        <p>The signs of physeal injury are similar to those of a fracture; predominantly with pain and swelling specifically located at the ends of bones (Lipp 1998). Diagnosis of the injury is usually by X-ray. Any child presenting with signs and symptoms should be thoroughly assessed as an initial displacement of the epiphysis may occur before returning to a normal position and result in a shearing injury (Lipp 1998). Any injury that involves the physis should be referred to a specialist orthopaedic surgeon for definitive treatment and follow up. The history of how the injury happened (mechanism) is an essential element of the diagnosis. Injuries are commonly classified using Salter Harris (Salter and Harris 1963) classification (Box 24.1).</p>

                            <li>Salter Harris Type I and II are managed by closed reduction and application of a cast.</li>

                        <p>A return to mobilisation with full range of motion is the priority following removal of the cast, and may take up to four weeks. Disturbance of growth may be associated with this injury but is dependent on the bones involved, the extent of the injury and the age at which injury occurs along with the amount of expected remaining growth (Lipp 1998). Complications are uncommon if injuries are managed effectively (Pring and Wenger 2005).</p>

                        <h3>Clavicle fractures</h3>
                        <p>Clavicle (collar bone) fractures are common in children (see Figure 24.3), often occurring due to a fall or trauma directly to the bone with an incidence of 198 per 100000 in the 0-14 age group (Nordqvist and Petersson, 1994). Most fractures (80-90%) occur in the middle third of the bone (Hart et al., 2006b) with some fractures incomplete due to the strong periosteum of the clavicle (Shannon et al., 2009).</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_15_e59ad744ad7bac926a7cg-343-1.jpg" alt="X-ray showing a fracture of the mid-clavicle with slight angulation in a two-year-old child." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Signs of a clavicle fracture are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>tenderness directly over the fracture site</li>
                            <li>bruising</li>
                            <li>swelling</li>
                            <li>crepitus that is easy to palpate as the bone is near the skin surface</li>
                            <li>restriction of movement</li>
                            <li>holding the arm close to the body and supporting it with the opposite hand.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Neonatal fractures are usually caused by birth trauma especially in infants with a birth weight greater than 4 kg and following a difficult delivery (Pring and Wenger 2005). Neonatal fractures may be associated with brachial plexus palsy and will require further evaluation (Dunham 2003; Pring and Wenger 2005) as infants may present with a lack of spontaneous movement. Neonatal clavicle fractures usually heal spontaneously and successfully with the infant starting to move the arm in two to three weeks.</p>
                        <p>With this fracture, neurovascular observation should be performed on the distal extremities to include pulses, motor function, sensation and reflexes (Shannon et al. 2009). A simple sling is advocated for two to three weeks until the child is comfortable. Pinning the sleeve to the body or wrapping the arm to the body with bandage may be useful for infants (Pring and Wenger 2005) as it may be difficult to restrict movement in this age group. While the majority of fractures heal uneventfully with the use of a simple sling, some angulation and deformity may occur. Fractures may heal with a visible and palpable bump obvious at the fracture site due to increased callus formation. The child will require follow-up X-rays in four to six weeks and contact sports should be avoided for another two to three weeks after that (Hart et al., 2006b).</p>
                        <p>Surgery is rarely indicated but considered if the fracture is open, the skin is broken, the fracture is complicated or comminuted and where there is neurovascular injury (Moonot and Ashwood 2009). Complications from clavicle fractures in children are rare.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Elbow fractures</h3>
                        <p>Elbow fractures are common in children usually following a fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH). Care needs to be taken when interpreting X-rays of the elbow and using X-ray as a diagnostic tool; recognition is difficult as the bones of the elbow are poorly developed in childhood and ossify at different rates (Hart et al., 2006b). The location of nerves and vascular structures around the elbow plus the limited ability of the elbow to remodel post fracture mean that elbow fractures are commonly subject to open or closed reduction.</p>
                        <p>The most common fracture in the elbow region in children is a supracondylar fracture of the humerus (Babel et al., 2010) with peak incidence at ages four to seven years (Hart et al., 2011). It has the highest rate of complications of any fracture in children with a neurological injury or deficit occurring in 20% of cases (Robertson et al., 2012).</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>The most common mechanism of injury is a FOOSH. During the fall the child’s arm hyperextends and causes a fracture with the distal fragment normally being displaced posteriorly (Hart et al., 2006b) which may affect both the vessels and nerves posterior to the fracture (Figures 24.4 and 24.5). Neurovascular assessment of the arm should involve a thorough evaluation of motor, sensory and vascular structures (Box 24.2). The brachial or radial pulse needs to be assessed to ensure that there is no vascular injury. A white or cool hand or absence of pulse usually indicates arterial compromise and need for urgent reduction. Owing to extensive swelling the arm also needs to be assessed for compartment syndrome (Chapter 9) so neurovascular assessment must be performed regularly and documented accurately. The fractured bone may also cause puckering of the skin (Platt 2004) with an urgent need for reduction so as to prevent the overlying skin becoming ischaemic and necrotic. Neurovascular assessment can be difficult as there will be significant swelling and pain with the child experiencing considerable fear and anxiety. Gaining their cooperation is essential but often difficult because of the challenges associated with a child’s level of understanding and compliance (Robertson et al., 2012). Neurovascular observations are also necessary pre- and post-surgery/treatment alongside elevation of the arm with fingers above the elbow recommended. The anatomy of this region is complex leading to high complication rates. Damage to the brachial artery, median nerve and/or ulnar nerve may be possible. A complication associated with the fracture is Volkman’s ischaemic contracture; a permanent flexion contracture.</p>

                            <p>Robertson et al. (2012) retrospectively reviewed the case notes of all children admitted to an emergency department (ED) with upper limb injuries over a three month period. Inclusion criteria were that the child had an upper limb injury that required admission and intervention from the orthopaedic team under general anaesthetic. 121 patients were identified, 61 males and 60 females and another six who were referred from an ED at another hospital. The age range was from 1-12 years. The commonest injury was a fractured radius and ulna (39.8%) with a fall the most common mechanism of injury (42.1%). Neurological status was documented in 107 cases (88.4%) using the terms ‘NVI’, ‘CSM’, ‘sensation’ and ‘moving.’ There was no mention of particular nerves being examined in 114 cases with the anterior interosseous nerve never mentioned.</p>
                            <p>In the three months ten patients had neurological deficits (8.2%) with supracondylar fracture involved in 40% of these. None of these deficits were identified on initial examination in the ED. The authors acknowledge that while some of these may have occurred after ED assessment, this is unclear due to the lack of documentation.</p>
                            <p><strong>Discussion:</strong> Over 90% of patients had no documentation of neurological examination. There were no records of which nerves were assessed or what tests had been performed to assess neurovascular status. This included those who had confirmed neurological injury. The authors concluded that this area of practice was deficient and that there should be documentary evidence that the radial, median, ulnar nerve and anterior interosseous nerve had all been assessed in the ED. Neurovascular assessment of all limb injuries should be standard practice.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Classification is most commonly based on displacement using Gartland’s classification (Gartland 1959) (Box 24.3). Treatment will depend on the grade of fracture. Type 1 is usually placed in an above elbow cast or sling for three to four weeks with the elbow held in 90 degrees of flexion unless swelling impedes this (Hart et al., 2006b). Type 2-3 fractures may require surgical intervention with closed or open reduction with pins or Kirschner (K) wires to hold the position after reduction. Three weeks after surgery K wires are removed and the child should be allowed to resume most activities. Children will continue to be monitored for another two to three months. If reduction cannot be achieved with closed reduction open reduction is necessary.</p>

                        <h3>Forearm fractures</h3>
                        <p>Radial fractures (Figures 24.6 and 24.7) are common at any age (Schneider et al., 2007) and this is an expected fracture in older children with the usual mechanism of injury a FOOSH. Increased engagement in sporting activities has increased the incidence of radial fractures (Khosla et al., 2003) and de Putter et al. (2011) report that fractures in the five to nine age group are mainly caused by accidents in the home. Those older than nine years primarily fracture their forearm during sporting activity. Radial fractures can be classified as ‘plastic deformation’ (bowing), ‘buckle’ (torus) (Figure 24.7), greenstick, transverse, comminuted or physeal (Hart et al., 2006b). Confirmation of fracture is made by antero-posterior (AP) and lateral X-rays which will also confirm the type of fracture and the bones involved. It is essential in a midforearm fracture that both the wrist and elbow are X-rayed to assess for displacement at the joints above and below.</p>

                        <p>The management of the fracture will depend on the type and location. Closed reduction and immobilisation remains the main treatment option in children (Schneider et al., 2007). Simple stable fractures such as the ‘buckle’ are managed in a short arm cast for three to four weeks mainly for pain control. After the cast is removed normal activities can resume without restrictions and no review appointment. A splint is an alternative immobilisation option but keeping the splint in place in children can be difficult. This has been the subject of a Cochrane systematic review (Box 24.4).</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span>Cochrane review: casting v splinting in forearm fractures (Abraham et al., 2008)</h4>
                            <p>This systematic review evaluated removable splintage versus plaster casts for undisplaced ‘buckle’ forearm fractures. Cast length, position and surgical fixation for displaced wrist fractures in children were considered. Ten trials involving 827 children concluded that minor buckle fractures could be treated by a removable splint. Fractures that have the potential to displace should be placed in below elbow casts. While surgery helped to avoid re-displacement of some types of fractures the long-term benefits were unconfirmed. Two of three search authors evaluated the quality of the studies and extracted data. Searches between 1966 to 2007 were performed of the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (2007) and Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, Cinahl and their reference lists. Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing types and position of casts plus surgical fixation were considered.</p>
                            <p><strong>Findings:</strong> four trials compared removable splints versus traditional below-elbow casts in children with buckle fractures. No short term deformity was noted in the four trials with one having no re-fracture in six months. The ‘Futura’ splint was shown to be cheaper, less restrictive and preferred by child and parent. Children were able to bathe and be active with less restriction. A soft bandage was more comfortable, convenient and less painful. Home removal plaster casts by parents did not produce less favourable outcomes and were preferred. Two trials evaluated below-elbow and above-elbow casts - cast type did not affect re-displacement of reduced fractures or cast-related complications. One trial considered the effect of arm position in above-elbow casts and found no effect on deformity. Three trials found percutaneous wiring significantly reduced re-displacement and re-manipulation one found no advantage in function at three months after injury.</p>
                            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Limited evidence supports the use of removable splintage for buckle fractures instead of above-elbow casts in fractures of the forearm after reduction. Percutaneous wiring prevents re-displacement but the effects on long-term arm function are unclear. Further research is required to establish the optimum approach to splints and above-elbow casts after reduction of displaced fractures. Minor buckle fractures can be treated by a splint that is removable at home. Fractures that have the potential to re-displace could be put in below-elbow casts. Surgery helps to avoid re-displacement in some types of fractures, but long-term benefit is unconfirmed.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>A thorough examination of the arm must be carried out to identify if ulnar fractures are present as the management changes i.e. application of a long arm cast and possibly a longer period of immobilisation. The arm must also be assessed for other fractures caused by a FOOSH such as a scaphoid or supracondylar fracture (Hart et al., 2006b). Injuries to the radial, median or ulnar nerve can also occur with this fracture. Increased swelling is also a feature especially if the fracture is displaced and compartment syndrome can be a complication. The fracture may heal with some displacement but there is no consensus in the literature on how much displacement is acceptable and can be left to normal remodelling (Schneider et al., 2007).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Hand and finger fractures</h3>
                        <p>Hand fractures (Figure 24.8) are common in children and young people with the fifth metacarpal and phalanges the most common bones affected. Treatment is by closed reduction with casting/splinting. It can be difficult to keep a splint on a young child with hand and finger fractures but they usually heal quite quickly with casts in place for 3-6 weeks depending on the injury (Hart et al., 2006b).</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Different casts are applied depending on the area of the hand involved. Thumb fractures are treated by immobilisation in a ‘thumb spica’. Fractures of the index finger are often treated in a radial ‘gutter’ short-arm cast and those of long, ring and little fingers with an ulnar gutter short-arm cast (Hart et al., 2006b). Finger fractures must also be assessed for physeal injuries.</p>
                        <p>Fractures of the scaphoid bone are common in young people, presenting in isolation or with other injuries of the hand (see Figure 24.9). Diagnosis is made on the basis of patient history, examination and clinical signs plus tenderness of the ‘anatomical snuff box’ and X-ray. There is a risk of non-union and osteonecrosis with this fracture type and if displaced internal fixation may be necessary to maintain blood supply to fragments (Gillon 2001).</p>

                        <h3>Femoral shaft fractures</h3>
                        <p>While fractures of the femoral shaft are less common in children than adults (see Figure 24.10) it is the most typical fracture requiring hospitalisation as it is associated with high impact trauma usually resulting from road traffic accidents. Bener et al. (2007) conducted a retrospective review of femoral fracture incidence in Qatar between January 1992-December 2004. There were 256 femoral fractures in young people aged 1-16 in that timeframe in 82% boys and 18% girls. The frequent sites of presenting femoral fractures included 16 of the neck (6.3%), 33 upper third (12.9%), 147 middle (57.4%), 38 lower (14.8%) and 22 condyle (8.6%). The most common mechanism of injury was pedestrian motor vehicle accident (43.4%).</p>

                        <p>Treatment of femoral shaft fractures depend on the site and extent of fracture, the age of the child and if open or closed reduction is required. Standard treatment is for infants to be immobilised in a Pavlik harness (Chapter 22) younger children in traction (Chapter 8), Thomas splint (Chapter 8) or spica cast (Chapter 22) and adolescents treated with internal fixation with an intramedullary nail. The length of hospitalisation may vary greatly depending on the method of treatment (Table 24.1).</p>

                        <p>While age-based algorithms are useful in suggesting treatment methods there are other factors to be considered. The ability to care for a child at home is an important consideration. Traction still remains a viable option where other treatment options are not suitable. Anglen and Choi (2005) advocate that spica casting in children over 100 pounds (approximately 45 kg) may not be effective or safe and size, weight, activity level and family circumstances will also need to be considered.</p>
                        <p>Surgical treatment may be considered superior in older or larger children and adolescents. This is especially the case following multiple trauma and with soft tissue injury, obesity or head injury. Box 24.5 discusses evidence that highlights the increased risk of complications in children who are obese. Adolescents who have reached an acceptable size may be considered for rigid nailing and in younger children flexible nailing may be used (Anglen and Choi 2005). Flexible nailing is well suited to fractures of the central 2/3 of the diaphysis. However, surgery is not without complications. Leet et al.’s (2005) limitations highlighted a lack of consistency in the measurement of obesity.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span>Evidence digest: Obesity and surgery for fractured shaft of femur</h4>
                            <p>Leet et al. (2005) undertook a retrospective review of the charts of children who were admitted with femoral shaft fractures between the ages of 6-14 and had surgery. 104 children were identified with 59 having external fixation and 45 an intramedullary rod inserted. Six children were considered obese and four were overweight at the time of surgery and of those ten, four (40%) had complications post-surgery that required admission to hospital. These complications were infections that required IV antibiotics or wound dehiscence. Twelve percent of the remaining children had a complication.</p>
                            <p>The authors concluded that obese children have an increased risk of postoperative complications compared with children who are not obese and that parents of children who are obese should be warned about this increased risk.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Fractures of the femur in children under five years usually have further investigation as non-accidental injury may be suspected (Anglen and Choi 2005, Pring et al., 2005). However, it must also be noted that this is not the cause in the majority of cases, with a fractured femur also occurring from minimal trauma during play in the young child (Pring et al., 2005). Therefore, this fracture type needs to be managed by experienced professionals in a non-judgmental manner (Chapter 21). Complications associated with fractures of the femur depend on the site of the fracture and the method of treatment. Attention is required in the management to ensure leg length is maintained (Pring et al., 2005) especially as the age of the child increases as there is less time for remodelling.</p>

                        <h3>Tibial fracture</h3>
                        <p>Tibia fracture is also a common injury in children with 50% of all tibial fractures occurring in the distal third (Setter and Palomino 2006). The mechanism of injury is usually direct or indirect force. Indirect force is mainly sports, motor vehicle accidents and falls (Mubarak et al., 2009) with football, skiing and rugby all associated with this type of fracture (Rennie et al., 2007). Fractures are usually oblique or spiral (see Figure 24.11) with the younger child requiring less force than in those who are older. Typically a child with a tibial fracture will present with a history of a traumatic event (either witnessed or unwitnessed), pain, an inability to weight bear, swelling, bruising and deformity (Setter and Palomino, 2006). Younger children, especially toddlers, may not have swelling and deformity. In 30% of tibial fractures, a fracture of the fibula will also be present (Hart et al., 2006c). AP and lateral X-ray views that include the knee and ankle are required to confirm the diagnosis.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_15_e59ad744ad7bac926a7cg-348-2.jpg" alt="X-ray showing an oblique/spiral fracture of the distal tibia and fibula with minimal deformity." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Simple closed tibial fractures in children can be managed with closed reduction and immobilisation without a need for surgery (Hart et al., 2006c). Surgery may be required if the fracture is open, comminuted and/ or irreducible or if casting has been unsuccessful. As always, understanding the mechanism of injury may help in the reduction of the fracture (Mubarak et al., 2009). The length of time in a cast following reduction will depend on type and location of fracture, the treatment and age of the child. The younger the child the less time they spend immobilised, ranging from three to four weeks for a toddler to three to four months for a young person/adolescent. A full or half (short) leg cast will be applied depending on the fracture location. Mubarak et al. (2009) recommends a long leg cast to be applied for four to six weeks for both non-displaced metaphyseal and physeal fractures. However, a displaced metaphyseal fracture requires a closed or open reduction under general anaesthetic plus a cast for six to eight weeks. For a displaced physeal fracture suggested treatment is open reduction with internal fixation which may need CT (computerised tomography) to help plan for surgery and a long leg cast for four to six weeks. Finally, extra articular fractures (through a joint) involving the physis will require either a closed or open reduction with internal fixation and long leg cast.</p>
                        <p>Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is also a complication of this fracture type. Careful observation of neurovascular status is required regardless of the method of treatment and immobilisation. An acceleration of pain is the predominant symptom of ACS with presence especially on passive movement which will require splitting of a cast or padding (Hart et al., 2006c) and a thorough evaluation of the leg including possible measurement of incompartmental pressure (Chapter 9). Early recognition of compartment syndrome generally leads to a favourable outcome for the child and the importance of regular neurovascular observations performed accurately cannot be over-emphasised. In fractures with physeal involvement long-term follow-up for evaluation of physeal closure should be advocated (Mubarak et al., 2009).</p>
                        <p>A ‘toddler’ fracture is an undisplaced tibial fracture in a child under three years of age (Shravat et al., 1996). The child will present with guarding of the limb, a limp or an inability to weight bear (Hart et al., 2006c). Swelling and deformity may not be presenting symptoms. The mechanism of injury varies and occasionally the history is vague with the injury not noticed until the child is limping. X-rays may be inconclusive with no fracture visible and follow-up not necessary. It will also be necessary to rule out other causes of a limp such as irritable hip or Perthes disease. Usual management is application of a cast for comfort with the child allowed to walk and the site of the fracture determining what kind of cast is applied.</p>
                        <p>A Cozen’s fracture is a fracture of the proximal metaphyseal tibia in children mainly between ages three to six years. A typical mechanism of injury is trampoline jumping where often one child gets injured because there are several jumping (Mubarak et al., 2009). Treatment of a non-displaced fracture is with a long leg cast for six weeks with the knee flexed to ten degrees and a varus mould (Setter and Palamino 2006). A displaced fracture will require reduction under general anaesthetic and a long leg cast applied for six to eight weeks. It is a Palomino, an uncommon fracture but clinically important as development of post-fracture progressive valgus deformity can occur. It is reported that this valgus deformity occurs in approximately 50% of fractures in this area (Setter and Palomino 2006). Treatment of valgus deformity in younger children is primarily conservative, monitoring the leg until after puberty as it is possible that some remodelling may take place. The importance of regular follow-up must be stressed to the family. Surgery may be considered if no significant improvement has taken place and the child has reached puberty.</p>

                        <h3>Ankle fractures</h3>
                        <p>Ankle fractures are also common in children and most fractures happen in the distal third of the tibia and fibula (medial and lateral malleolus) as a result of twisting, falls and direct trauma between the ages of 10-15. The clinical signs are pain, swelling, deformity and difficulty/inability to weight bear. Initial treatment of ankle fractures is known by the anagram ‘PRICE’ - protection, rest, ice, compression and elevation (Nicholas and Cooper 2009). Diagnosis is on the basis of both AP and lateral plain X-rays. It is also important to be aware that distal tibial fractures can involve the physis and this is the second most common site of Salter Harris injuries after the radius (Hart et al., 2006c). The grading of injury will affect how the child is managed; closed reduction to grades I and II and open reduction and stabilisation to grades III and IV. All fractures will require casting for six to eight weeks (Figure 24.12). The majority of fractures in this area have a good prognosis but this depends on the severity of the injury, the skeletal age of the young person, fracture type and the reduction achieved (Hart et al., 2006c).</p>

                        <h3>Metatarsal fractures</h3>
                        <p>Fractures of the metatarsal are the most common fracture of the foot in children. See Figure 24.13 for an example. The first and fifth metatarsals are the usual sites. Mechanisms of injury include falling from a low height such as a bed or something heavy falling onto a foot. Physical examination reveals swelling, inability to weight-bear, bruising or limp. Diagnosis is determined using anterolateral and oblique X-rays (Hart et al., 2006) with conservative treatment with application of a short leg walking cast for three to four weeks. Open, displaced or comminuted fractures will require further operative treatment.</p>

SCI in children is uncommon (Vogel et al., 2004; Johnston et al., 2005; Mathison et al., 2008) but the severity is greater. In children under five years the incidence of injury in males and females is equal. However, as they grow older the incidence in males far exceeds that in females. Worldwide, sports such as diving, soccer, rugby, horseback riding, skiing, wrestling, trampoline and bicycle accidents are common causes for spinal injuries. Motor vehicles are the greatest cause and result in more serious injury. It is hoped that the implementation of the correct use of car seats for children can result in a reduction of SCI (Vogel et al., 2004). Violence is reported as a common cause in adolescents especially due to street violence (Mathison et al., 2008). Johnston et al. (2005) retrospectively reviewed the records from 1986 to 2003 of 190 children who had suffered spinal cord injury in Pennsylvania and found the most common causes were vehicular (n=105), sports (n=25), gunshot wound (n=26), medical (n=16) and other (n=18). Other reasons included falls, direct trauma to the spine, roller coaster and birth injury.</p>
                        <p>The diagnosis of spinal cord injury in children is comparatively difficult as it is not always obvious on X-rays (Mathison et al., 2008) and many children present with spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA). The advent of MRI has advanced the diagnosis of SCIWORA and it is estimated that 30-40% of children with traumatic spinal injury have such a condition (Li et al., 2011). Laxity of ligaments in children means that the vertebral column can stretch without disruption but the spinal cord can only stretch minimally and so becomes damaged. As children grow this laxity decreases so SCIWORA is most common in children under eight years of age. Damage to the spinal cord can be complete or incomplete with the younger child more at risk of complete injury (Mathison et al., 2008).</p>
                        <p>Assessment of the child with a spinal injury consists of history, physical examination, X-rays, CT and MRI. Treatment options are limited with immobilisation in an age-appropriate orthosis or surgical stabilisation recommended (Mathison et al., 2008; Li et al., 2011). Musculoskeletal complications in children with SCI are scoliosis and hip dysplasia with a large proportion of those who suffer SCI before puberty developing both and requiring corrective surgery (Vogel et al., 2004). This reduces significantly in those injured after puberty.</p>
                        <p>The effect of the injury on the child and family is enormous with changes evident within family dynamics and the team focus to ensure both child and family adjust to the injury. The provision of coordinated care by a multidisciplinary team is essential. The goal for all is to maintain active participation at home, school and other activities so to ensure they continue to develop socially. The focus is on promoting independence, rehabilitation and transition from hospital to home (Vogel et al., 2004). The reader should refer to Chapter 19 for further discussion of care following spinal cord injury.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In frequent or multiple fractures in children the most likely cause is non-accidental injury (NAI) (Jenny 2006). Carty (1993) identified metaphyseal, rib, scapular, vertebral or subluxations plus fracture of the outer end of the clavicle. In addition finger injuries in non-ambulant children, bilateral and complex skull fractures plus fractures at different stages of healing were identified as the most common sites for NAI fractures.</p>
                        <p>Children under two and those who are pre-verbal are most at risk (Jenny 2006). Issues for practitioners to consider are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>fractures are often found in cases of fatal abuse</li>
                            <li>fractures of normal bones (non-pathological) require considerable force</li>
                            <li>fractures that are sudden and painful - the child does not play normally afterwards</li>
                            <li>pain is immediately worse after the fracture</li>
                            <li>in late presentation loss of function may be the only symptom</li>
                            <li>lack of associated bruising does not exclude NAI</li>
                            <li>most abusive fractures are in children under three years</li>
                            <li>most non-abusive fractures occur in children over five years (Selby 2011).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Practitioners also need to remember that several medical conditions may cause multiple fractures in children. These are osteogenesis imperfecta, preterm birth, rickets, osteomyelitis, copper deficiency or bones that are demineralised secondary to paralysis. Many parents whose child has such disorders report they were initially accused of abusing their child. Hence, children need a careful assessment if NAI is suspected including a full history, skeletal survey, bloods for metabolic or bone disease and eye examination (Jenny 2006). Most units have protocols for this and children less than two years of age will be reviewed by a paediatrician before discharge to ensure that children who may be at risk of future injury are not discharged until review is completed. The reader should review Chapter 21 for further detail regarding NAI.</p>
