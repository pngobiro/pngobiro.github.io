                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Sarcoma is a rare form of cancer which affects all age groups and all parts of the body. There are approximately 3200 new diagnoses in the United Kingdom (UK) each year (Sarcoma UK 2012). It affects connective tissue of the body including bone, muscle, nerve, fat and blood vessel cells. A sarcoma is often described as either ‘bone’ or ‘soft tissue’ as although it usually affects bone it can also be found extra-skeletally. Conversely sarcoma that primarily affects soft tissue can also be found in bone. Sarcoma is a primary cancer which originates from one of the cells of connective tissue. Bone cancer can also be metastatic in instances where a primary cancer, for example lung or breast, has spread to the bone. This is treated very differently to sarcoma and so practitioners need to be aware of the differences.</p>
                        <p>Bone sarcoma is more prevalent in younger age groups whereas soft tissue sarcoma is more likely in older age, although this does not make either exclusive to these age groups and there is currently no definitive evidence to show any reason for this. Sarcoma has a slightly higher incidence in males than females but the reason for this is also unclear. The importance of a prompt diagnosis cannot be overstated as this has a direct effect on prognosis, especially if the delay leads to the patient presenting with metastatic disease. The signs and symptoms of sarcoma can be as simple as a non-painful soft tissue swelling or as severe as a pathological fracture of bone. Figure 15.1 shows a soft tissue sarcoma of the upper arm. Figure 15.2 shows a pathological fracture of the distal femur.</p>

                        <p>Patients do not tend to become systemically unwell with sarcoma at an early stage and this can be a deterrent to diagnosis as a painful limb could have many differential diagnoses, of which sarcoma does not rank highly in the minds of many practitioners. It is suggested that a general practitioner (GP) will only encounter an average of one sarcoma diagnosis in their career. It is important for practitioners to not only be aware of sarcoma, but to have a knowledge base that will support them well when coming into contact with these patients and their families. Due to the rare nature of this cancer type is it unlikely that a person newly diagnosed with sarcoma would have heard of it before, or know of someone who has been given the diagnosis previously. This can make the diagnosis even more daunting than a diagnosis of a more common cancer type. For them to be cared for by a practitioner who is also unaware of the implications of their diagnosis and treatment can lead to a very disjointed, misinformed care pathway in which the patient and family feel unsupported.</p>
                        <p>The majority of sarcoma will be treated surgically in an orthopaedic setting but, due to the fact that sarcoma can be diagnosed in any anatomical site, practitioners could come into contact with sarcoma in any setting. It is therefore of paramount importance for sarcoma education to be included in orthopaedic as well as oncology texts.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Bone sarcoma occurs in the younger age group under the age of 30 years. There is one type of bone cancer, chondrosarcoma, that originates from cartilage cells that has greater prevalence in the older age range of 50 years plus. The two most common types of bone sarcoma in the younger population are Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma. Bone sarcoma can occur in any skeletal bone but remains more prevalent in the long bones of the limbs and the pelvis. They often occur around joints which may be a reason for them being misdiagnosed as the differential diagnoses can be seen as a more likely diagnosis.</p>

                        <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
                        <p>The most common symptom of bone sarcoma is pain in the affected area. This pain can be more of an issue at night and can wake a person from their sleep due to its intensity. In some cases the bone tumour can break through the cortex of the bone involved and invade soft tissue, resulting in a noticeable soft tissue mass unlike tumors that are contained within bone. Bone tumours can also weaken bone and this can lead to the first symptom presenting as a pathological fracture. Although pathological fractures are associated with older patients, they can occur in patients of all ages with bone tumors. Although the majority of patients with a primary bone sarcoma do not feel systemically unwell, patients with Ewing’s sarcoma can suffer from fever and a general malaise.</p>

                        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>Bone sarcoma cannot always be detected on X-ray and therefore the need for further investigation where bone pain cannot be explained is very important. Diagnosis of bone sarcoma should never be given without a proven histological diagnosis. This ensures the type of sarcoma is established and the correct treatment regimen is administered from the outset. It is vital that the diagnosis is made correctly in the first instance to reduce delays in treatment and therefore to improve outcomes. Any patient with a suspected bone sarcoma should be referred to a specialist centre. Specialist centres ensure that patients are cared for by clinicians and specialist staff who regularly care for patients and families with this rare group of cancers. Any lesion that is suspicious of a primary malignant bone tumour should have a biopsy in a specialist centre (Hogendoorn et al., 2010). The biopsy can be undertaken in a number of ways: either under image guidance, be it ultrasound, fluoroscopy or computed tomography (CT), or as an open procedure in the operating theatre (the preferred option for children). The decision relating to how the biopsy should be performed will be discussed within the specialist multidisciplinary team (MDT) and will depend on the size, location and histological subtype of the tumour. Biopsies need to be undertaken by specialists and it is important to ensure the biopsy tract can be removed as part of the plan. Caution is needed for patients who are taking anticoagulation therapy as this may lead to a delay in the biopsy whilst the medication is temporarily withdrawn in order for clotting assessment to be made. Figure 15.3 shows a fluoroscopic guided biopsy of a chondrosarcoma of the right femur.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <h3>Impact of delayed diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>Delays in diagnosis of bone sarcoma are common in all parts of the pathway mainly due to lack of awareness of the potential for a malignant diagnosis (Grimer et al., 2010 ). The longer a patient has to wait for a diagnosis, especially with high-grade bone sarcoma, the more likely it will be that they may have metastases at diagnosis. This is a factor in a poorer prognosis and it is therefore vital to gain a diagnosis and commence treatment as soon as possible. See Box 15.1 for discussion of evidence underpinning early diagnosis.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span>Evidence digest: Study of sarcoma size at presentation (Grimer 2006)</h4>
                            <p>This study looked at a total of 1460 patients who had been diagnosed with sarcoma and who had received three years of post-operative follow-up. The patients had been cared for at one hospital and the aim of the study was to look at whether the size of sarcoma at presentation had a bearing on the patient’s outcome. The NICE (2005) guidelines for sarcoma state that any patient with a soft tissue mass of over 5 cm should be referred to a sarcoma specialist and presumed to be a sarcoma until proven otherwise. The study took the size of sarcoma at time of diagnosis and this information was gained from the medical notes of all the patients. It showed that the mean size of soft tissue sarcoma at presentation was 10 cm which is double the recommended size for referral. Bone sarcoma had an average of 11.3 cm and there seemed to be little difference with changes in patient age or type of sarcoma diagnosis. The detection of metastatic disease at presentation had a direct link to the size of sarcoma at diagnosis. The prognosis for all patients without metastatic disease worsened with the increase in size of tumour. The outcome of the study was to increase the awareness of sarcoma to try to reduce the size of these tumours at diagnosis. The hope is that with smaller tumours being diagnosed the patient’s overall outcomes and prognoses will improve.</p>

                        <h3>Staging</h3>
                        <p>Staging of sarcoma should be undertaken once a definite diagnosis has been given. Staging should include a CT scan or, more commonly, a PET scan; these give the treating clinician information relating to whether metastatic disease is present. This is important when deciding on the treatment plan for patients; for example, it would be less likely for a surgeon to offer an amputation as a surgical option if the patient already has lung metastases.</p>

                        <h3>Treatments</h3>
                        <p>The treatment for a sarcoma will depend on the histological diagnosis of each lesion. Treatments including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are options that will be determined by the results of histology. Some patients receive surgery alone, where others may need to have a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</p>
                        <p>Surgery can vary considerably for both bone and soft tissue sarcoma removal. For soft tissue sarcoma it can be as simple as wide local excision of the lesion or there could be extensive excision of the tumour and surrounding soft tissue that necessitates subsequent plastic surgery reconstruction. For bone sarcoma, the surgery can be as straightforward as an excision of a bone tumour with no reconstruction needed, to surgery including amputation of a limb or limb lengthening using external fixation and bone transport (Chapter 8). Surgery for bone sarcoma of a limb now focuses much more upon limb salvage, whereas in the past amputation would have been the preferred surgical option. Limb salvage is the preferred choice due to the advances in limb salvage surgery. This includes the improvement of the type of prostheses that are available to be used and also the new techniques available to orthopaedic surgeons, for example bone transport. Orthopaedic nurses are therefore very involved in the surgical care of bone sarcoma patients. Children now have the option of a non-invasive growing prosthesis which enables lengthening of the prosthesis as a day case non-operative procedure rather than having to undergo a number of operations to extend the prosthesis which was the previous method. Patients with chondroma of the sacrum may require a total sacrectomy, this can be very invasive surgery which can lead to the loss of nerves, potentially leaving the patient incontinent and in need of stoma reconstruction. Surgery with a curative intent aims to be much more radical than surgery for a palliative intent. The surgery for sarcoma should be discussed with the patient who should be supported by the multidisciplinary team.</p>
                        <p>Radiotherapy for primary bone sarcoma is usually undertaken on a daily basis, Monday-Friday for a period of up to six weeks.</p>
                        <p>Chemotherapy for primary bone sarcoma will also depend on the histological diagnosis, but can be given in the day care setting or as an inpatient for up to four to five days depending on the treatment regimen. This means that the length of treatment for primary bone sarcoma can last as long as nine to 12 months. This is a factor that needs to be taken into account when the patients are often of an age where they are at school, attending university or in the early stages of employment. A number of the chemotherapy agents used to treat bone sarcoma can cause infertility. This is an issue for teenagers and young adults and needs to be discussed in detail with them. Patients with issues relating to fertility should be counselled suitably and referred to fertility centres when appropriate. The type of chemotherapy used is extremely toxic and the team need to ensure that patients are fit enough to tolerate it. Many centres do not offer the high dose chemotherapy to patients over the age of 40. Due to the toxic nature of the treatments used, patients over the age of 40 will have the option of high dose chemotherapy discussed with them on an individual basis. From experience many people over the age of 40 who do start high dose chemotherapy are unable to finish the course of treatment due to the high incidence of side effects which become intolerable for them.</p>
                        <p>The types of treatments used will be discussed in more detail with each subtype of sarcoma and also in the evidence digest. The most common types of bone sarcoma will now be further explored. See Box 15.2 for a discussion of clinical practice guidelines.</p>

                            <p>A number of leading specialists have worked together to produce European guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of these tumours.</p>
                            <p>The guidelines clearly define the pathway for which any patients with suspected sarcoma should follow, this includes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>referral to a specialist sarcoma service</li>
                                <li>biopsy to ONLY be undertaken by a member of the specialist sarcoma MDT</li>
                                <li>treatment plans to be discussed by the sarcoma MDT and decided on an individual basis</li>
                                <li>follow-up to include regular scanning for disease recurrence and metastatic disease.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These guidelines are intended to ensure the early diagnosis and correct treatment for sarcoma patients.

                        <span class="heading-text">Osteosarcoma</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Osteosarcoma is a disease which is still not fully understood. It was first described in 1805 by French surgeon Alexis Boyer who found that these lesions were a very different type of disease to other bone lesions (Peltier 1993). Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone sarcoma and in the UK, for example, it accounts for approximately 131 new diagnoses each year (NCIN 2012). Osteosarcoma has its highest incidence between the ages of five and 20 years. It is very uncommon in the under fives, although not unreported, and increases in incidence with age throughout the teenage years. It has a higher incidence in males than females although there is no apparent reason for this.</p>
                        <p>Osteosarcoma becomes a life threatening condition once metastatic disease is present. Once a diagnosis of osteosarcoma has been made the need for staging scans, usually CT scan of the chest or PET CT, is of paramount importance. Metastatic disease can be undetectable very early on in the disease process but it is reported that approximately 80% of patients with a high-grade osteosarcoma diagnosis will present with metastatic disease (Kim and Helman 2010). Figure 15.4 shows metastatic chest disease of a 32-year-old osteosarcoma patient.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_15_e59ad744ad7bac926a7cg-206-1.jpg" alt="CT scan of the chest showing multiple small nodules, which are metastatic osteosarcoma lesions, scattered throughout the lungs." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Figure 15.4 CT scan of the chest showing metastatic osteosarcoma</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Treatment for osteosarcoma depends, as with all sarcomas, on the histological subtype. A low-grade parosteal osteosarcoma can be treated with surgery alone to remove the tumour. A high grade osteosarcoma of bone is treated with a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. The chemotherapy is given neo-adjuvantly and again adjuvantly depending on response rate. The chemotherapy regime used most often is MAP chemotherapy, a combination of doxorubicin, cisplatin and methotrexate. Although there is still no worldwide census on the best chemotherapy regimens for osteosarcoma, a review by Anninga et al. (2011) shows that drug regimens using three drugs, such as MAP, are the most effective. This chapter does not expand upon MAP as this is an orthopaedic text and it is hoped to focus the nurse on the orthopaedic treatments for these patients. Links for the chemotherapy treatments are however included for further reading.</p>
                        <p>When caring for patients in the orthopaedic setting who have received chemotherapy as part of their treatment it is important to be aware of the side effects which may affect their health. Surgery is usually planned in the ‘window’ between chemotherapy cycles to take advantage of reduced risk from the side effects. Neutropenic sepsis is the most important side effect to be considered and is due to cytotoxic chemotherapy agents causing myelosuppression and immunosuppression. If neutropenic sepsis occurs it can be life threatening and all cancer centres have guidelines for practitioners to follow when this is suspected. Patients require intravenous antibiotics within a certain timescale and this has been described as ‘door to needle in 60 minutes’. Signs to look for are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>temperature of >38°C</li>
                            <li>flu-like symptoms</li>
                            <li>dehydration.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If these occur an urgent blood test is required to assess the patient’s neutrophil count. An absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of &lt;1.0 x 109/L is diagnostic of neutropenia.</p>
                        <p>Nausea and vomiting are side effects of chemotherapy which can often be avoided with the use of anti-emetic agents. Unfortunately hair loss is a side effect which cannot be avoided in most cases as the drugs affect rapidly dividing cells such as the hair.</p>
                        <p>In 2011 NICE licensed the use of mifamutide (Mepact) in the treatment of patients with fully resected, non-metastatic osteosarcoma between the ages of two and 30 years. Mepact is an immunomodulator and is the first real advance in drug treatment for osteosarcoma in 20 years. Its precise mode of working in osteosarcoma is not known, but is thought to cause white blood cells to release chemicals which kill the cancer cells. It is used alongside conventional surgery and chemotherapy. The drug is given as an IV infusion over one hour, twice a week for the first 12 weeks and once a week for the following 24 weeks. It is a very expensive treatment option, but has been shown to produce an increase in overall survival (Kager et al., 2010).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Ewing’s sarcoma was first described in 1921 by James R Ewing who noted that the histology in a bone tumour that had been thought to be an osteosarcoma looked different in that it had ‘round cells’ which looked like blood vessels and initially he termed it ‘endothelioma of bone’. He first discussed a patient who was thought to have osteosarcoma of bone, who for some reason had not received the usual treatment of surgery at that time but had been treated with other modalities including radiation. Osteosarcoma was known to not be radiosensitive and so when his patient had a complete response to the radiation treatment, Ewing knew that he was dealing with something different. Unfortunately the patient then went on to have a recurrence of the tumour and it was decided that biopsy was required to settle the conundrum. It was here that Ewing found the different histological appearances and a little while later James Codman termed it Ewing’s sarcoma. Surgery and radiotherapy were initially the only treatments used to treat Ewing’s sarcoma until the 1960s when it was found to be responsive to certain chemotherapy agents (Samuels and Howe 1967; Cupps et al., 1969). In the 1980s the genetic diagnosis of Ewing’s sarcoma became possible with the identification of the chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 22 and 11, t (11;22). This defect can be found only in Ewing’s cancer cells, is not inherited and is found in approximately 90% of Ewing’s sarcomas. This has helped with the histological diagnosis and subsequent treatment.</p>
                        <p>As with osteosarcoma, patients diagnosed with Ewing’s sarcoma have systemic staging undertaken prior to commencement of treatments. Ewing’s can be treated successfully with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but in certain cases surgery is also part of the treatment regime. Chemotherapy for Ewings sarcoma has also become streamlined over the years and patients are often treated in line with the Euro-E.W.I.N.G 99 trial protocol which includes vincristine, ifosfamide, etoposide and doxorubicin. These drugs are given in combination and usually on a three-weekly cycle, as an inpatient for a maximum of six cycles. Again, due to the nature of the toxicity of the drugs patients require echocardiogram and EDTA creatinine clearance tests prior to the commencement of the regime. As discussed in the osteosarcoma section, patients who are having these toxic drug regimens need to have attention paid to their general health in order to diagnose any potential problems as soon as they occur.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Chondrosarcoma is the bone sarcoma which tends to affect those in the older age group but, as with all sarcomas, they are seen in all ages. The chance of being diagnosed with a chondrosarcoma increases with age and has no known definite cause. Chondrosarcoma is most common in the humerus and distal femur and has only a slightly higher incidence in males than females. Chondrosarcoma accounts for approximately 25% of malignant bone tumours and has a diverse behaviour pattern from the low-grade local tumour to the highgrade metastasising tumour (Fleming and Murphey 2000). Chondrosarcoma arises from the cartilage cells and certain conditions increase the chance of benign bone tumours differentiating into a chondrosarcoma including enchondroma, osteochondroma, multiple exostosis, Ollier’s disease and Malfucci’s syndrome (Unni and Inwards 2010). Patients with a diagnosis of chondrosarcoma require full staging as with all sarcoma patients and this is usually in the form of a bone scan and CT scan of the chest. The majority of chondrosarcoma are low-grade localised tumours that require only surgical excision. This can be anything from a curettage and cementation to an endoprosthetic replacement. Figure 15.5 is of an X-ray showing chondrosarcoma of the proximal humerus.</p>

                        <p>Patients receiving surgery for excision of chondrosarcoma are cared for very similarly to any orthopaedic patient but it needs to be remembered that they have been given a cancer diagnosis and therefore will require psychological support. Very few patients have a diagnosis of dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma and they will need to discuss their treatment options with an experienced sarcoma oncologist who may or may not offer chemotherapy as a treatment option depending on the extent of disease and the patient’s age. Most chondrosarcoma are resistant to radiotherapy treatment and so this is not a preferred treatment option.</p>
                        <p>Other bone sarcoma diagnoses are less common and are beyond the scope of this chapter, but need to be assessed and treated on an individual basis.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Soft tissue sarcoma</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Soft tissue sarcoma is more common than bone sarcoma and can affect all age groups and all anatomical sites of the body. There are many more subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma than bone sarcoma. From clinical experience liposarcoma appears to be the most common subtype and the thigh appears to be the most common anatomical site.</p>
                        <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
                        <p>Soft tissue sarcomas usually present as a soft tissue mass which can be either painful or pain free and can cause symptoms or be asymptomatic. The fact that the signs and symptoms can vary so drastically could also be a reason for them to be misdiagnosed. Soft tissue sarcomas are often difficult to locate on plain X-ray but ultrasound and MRI are much more useful to describe the size, site and positioning of the tumour in relation to other anatomical structures. As with bone sarcoma, patients do not usually become systemically unwell.</p>
                        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>The pathway for soft tissue sarcoma diagnosis is not as clearly defined as that of Bone sarcoma but it is advised that patients with suspected soft tissue sarcoma are seen within services which have experience in dealing with these tumours (Grimer et al., 2010). MRI can show suspicious features of a soft tissue mass but again the histological diagnosis is crucial to treatment decisions. Suspected soft tissue sarcoma is mainly biopsied under ultrasound guidance, although in some cases the soft tissue biopsies are undertaken by clinicians in the outpatient clinic setting. Again consideration and caution may need to be taken for patients receiving anticoagulation therapy. Grimer (2006) undertook a study which showed that the size of soft tissue sarcoma at diagnosis has an impact on prognosis. This study reviewed the cases of over 3000 patients who had been diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma over a 20-year time period. It was shown that the average size of soft tissue sarcoma at diagnosis was 10.7 cm and this had not significantly reduced in the last 20 years. It also showed that the size of tumour at diagnosis had a direct effect on whether the patient could receive limb salvage surgery against amputation, and the incidence of metastatic disease at presentation. The UK guidance on sarcoma is currently that any soft tissue mass of 5 cm or over should be treated as a soft tissue sarcoma until proven otherwise (National Institute of Clinical Excellence 2005).</p>
                        <h3>Treatments</h3>
                        <p>As with bone sarcoma, the treatments offered to soft tissue sarcoma patients also depends on the histological subtype. The main treatment options for soft tissue sarcoma without metastatic disease are surgery and radiotherapy. Chemotherapy is usually used more when the disease is metastatic.</p>
                        <p>The most common subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma will now be considered in more detail.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Liposarcoma</h4>
                        <p>Liposarcoma is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma in adults. It was first described in the 1860s as a malignant tumour of fat by Rudolph Virchow. Liposarcoma can arise in any part of the body and is currently subtyped as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>well differentiated</li>
                            <li>dedifferentiated</li>
                            <li>myxoid</li>
                            <li>round cell</li>
                            <li>pleomorphic.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The most common sites of presentation are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Well differentiated liposarcoma tends to arise in the limb and retroperitoneum.</li>
                            <li>Myxoid and/or round cell as well as pleomorphic arise in the limbs.</li>
                            <li>Dedifferentiated liposarcoma mainly arises in the retroperitoneum</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Liposarcoma is more common in the older population and rare in children (Vocks et al., 2000), and has a slightly higher incidence in males than females. Figure 15.6 shows an MRI scan of Liposarcoma of the thigh.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_15_e59ad744ad7bac926a7cg-209-1.jpg" alt="MRI scan showing a large, well-defined liposarcoma tumor in the thigh." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Figure 15.6 MRI scan of liposarcoma of the thigh</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>The presentation of liposarcoma, as with most soft tissue sarcoma, usually includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>soft tissue swelling</li>
                            <li>pain</li>
                            <li>reduced range of movement</li>
                            <li>numbness.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>However, patients with liposarcoma of the retroperitoneal cavity often complain of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>abdominal pain</li>
                            <li>weight loss</li>
                            <li>nausea</li>
                            <li>vomiting.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The treatment for liposarcoma is usually surgical excision although radiotherapy is now being used more frequently as a neo-adjuvant treatment for myxoid liposarcoma of the limb and trunk. It allows less radiation to be used than in the adjuvant setting and clinically does not appear to cause any adverse complications for surgery. Chemotherapy is not routinely used for liposarcoma in the primary diagnosis setting but can be used in the presentation of high grade tumours and metastatic liposarcoma (Dalal et al., 2008). This would be discussed with each individual patient after presentation at a specialist sarcoma MDT and remains, at this time, experimental.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Synovial sarcoma</h4>
                        <p>Synovial sarcoma is another common type of soft tissue sarcoma and is more prevalent in the younger age groups, especially within the first two decades of life (Vargas 2012). Synovial sarcoma does not, as its name suggests, arise in synovial joints but is named due to its similarity of cells to those of primitive synoviocytes. The most common anatomical sites for these tumours are around the knee but they can also be found often in the hands and feet. Synovial sarcoma has a specific chromosomal translocation which makes its diagnosis more specific as this is present in 90% of confirmed cases. The chromosomal translocation occurs at t(X;18) (p11.2;q11.2) (Knösel et al., 2010). This means that the X18 chromosome is affected and the p11:q11 are the points on the chromosome where the translocation takes place. Surgery is the main treatment option in this group of tumours. Although there have been discussions relating to the use of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, it has been show to date that this does not increase overall survival and so remains controversial (Vargas 2012).</p>
                        <p>As with all tumour removal surgery the ultimate aim is to gain local control and therefore a wide local excision is recommended; an excision margin of 1-3 cm is appropriate. The ability to gain this much clearance during surgery will depend on the location of the tumour and radiotherapy may be used adjuvantly if there is concern about clear margins. Synovial sarcoma has a high incidence of metastatic spread (Stefanovski et al., 2002) and patients with this disease should have very careful follow-up, as with all sarcoma patients.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Leiomyosarcoma</h4>
                        <p>Leiomyosarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma which originates in smooth muscle cells and can appear at any site of the body. For the purpose of this text leiomyosarcoma of the trunk and limbs will be the focus, however these tumours are common gynaecological tumours. Leiomyosarcoma tends to arise most commonly in adults and is one of the few soft tissue sarcomas that is more common in women, possibly related to the fact that they are most common in the gynaecological setting (Shah et al., 2005). Leiomyosarcoma accounts for approximately 10% of all soft tissue sarcomas (Schwartz 2007). Those that arise within venous walls have a poorer prognosis due to their ability to spread through the venous system leading to a higher incidence of metastatic disease. In the limb, leiomyosarcoma is most commonly treated with surgery to remove the tumour, the extent depending on its location, size and the patient’s general health. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used in the treatment of high grade tumours and metastatic disease and this would be discussed with each individual patient as required.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST)</h4>
                        <p>Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours arise from peripheral nerves or cells related to nerve sheath; for example, Schwann cells, perineural cells or fibroblasts. The term MPNST is now used to cover tumours which were previously named malignant schwannoma, neurofibrosarcoma and neurogenic sarcoma (Weiss and Goldburn 2001). MPNST is most commonly seen in adults, but has been noted in babies as young as 11 months (Ellison et al., 2005). It is seen most commonly in conjunction with large peripheral nerves such as the sacral nerve, brachial plexus and sacral plexus.</p>
                        <p>Treatment for MPNST is again surgically focused. The completion of surgery gaining wide (negative) margins is the intended outcome as this has been shown to reduce the likelihood of recurrence and metastatic disease (Geller and Gerbhardt 2006). The use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in this tumour type is also controversial and needs to be discussed with each patient on an individual basis to weigh up the potential benefits against potential costs in terms of side effects which may be long-term.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Epithelioid sarcoma</h4>
                        <p>Epithelioid sarcoma is the most common sarcoma of the hand and is a disease which is often found in the younger age group. These tumours are aggressive in nature and although they tend to be slow growing are known to often cause ulceration (Schwartz 2007). Epithelioid sarcoma often spreads along tendon sheaths and to lymph nodes associated with a high rate of recurrence and metastatic disease. It is suggested that an aggressive wide local excision should be used in the first instance (Scwartz 2007). Due to the aggressive nature of this disease radiotherapy is often used in the neo-adjuvant setting and chemotherapy is used on an individual basis.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Rhabdomyosarcoma</h4>
                        <p>Rhabdomyosarcoma accounts for approximately 20% of all soft tissue sarcoma. The embryonal and alveolar types are common in children and are the most common sarcoma in children whereas the pleomorphic type affects adults. A clear histological definition of rhabdomyosarcoma was available in 1946 when these tumours were found to have a distinct morphology of rhabdomyoblasts (Stout 1946). Due to the nature of this disease and its occurrence in children, the treatment consists of a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The survival rate for these children has greatly improved for localised disease with an 80% five year survival (Punyko et al., 2005). In patients with metastatic disease however, the survival rate has not really improved with a disease free survival rate at five years of only 30% (Oberlin et al., 2008).</p>

                        <p>Metastatic bone tumours are becoming more common now that treatments for cancer are improving. These tumours occur when a primary cancer of another origin spreads to bone. The most common of these are breast, lung, renal and prostate and usually present with the following symptoms:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>If these tumors are solitary they can be treated successfully with surgery and adjuvant treatment as deemed necessary by the oncologist treating their primary cancer site. It is important for the orthopaedic surgeon planning to operate on these patients to discuss their prognosis with the relevant oncologist. It would be more appropriate to offer an endoprosthetic replacement to a patient who had a relatively good prognosis than to someone who may only have weeks or months to live. This can sometimes be a very difficult decision to make so honest discussion relating to prognosis with all of the parties involved, including the patient and family, is key to ensuing the surgery is in the best interest of the patient.</p>
                        <p>Patients who are inpatients in the orthopaedic setting for surgery for metastatic bone disease often have more complex needs due to their primary cancer diagnosis, especially if they are still receiving oncology treatments. To have links to the patient’s specialist nurse/keyworker and oncology teams during this time will enable the practitioner caring for them to discuss any needs that may arise which are oncological rather than orthopaedic.</p>

                        <p>Bone sarcoma, due to its rarity, does not have a large number of trails open at any one time and it is the responsibility of the lead clinician to ensure the patient and family are aware of any clinical trials which they may be eligible to enter, even if it means they will receive their treatment in a different treatment centre. The problem with clinical trials in this group of patients is the fact that the number of patients diagnosed each year is low and therefore recruitment into clinical trials is small. The importance of clinical trials cannot be reiterated enough in a disease process where the development of treatments is slow to progress.</p>

                        <p>The nursing care of patients who have a diagnosis of primary bone sarcoma will depend very much on the treatments they receive. Surgery is usually undertaken in an orthopaedic setting under the care of an orthopaedic surgeon but frequently in collaboration with a plastic surgeon. The plastic surgery component of sarcoma treatment allows reconstruction of defects following the initial tumour removal. This is often done at the time of initial surgery but can also be undertaken at a later date if necessary. The age of the patient will also determine if the surgery is undertaken within the paediatric or adult setting. Depending on the nature of the surgery performed, patients can have a short hospital stay, for example, for a straightforward excision of bone tumour, or a longer hospital stay for amputation, complex endoprosthetic replacement or limb lengthening with Ilizarov technology. Patients receiving chemotherapy will usually do so as an inpatient and within the oncology setting. Orthopaedic practitioners need to be aware of the common side effects of chemotherapy treatments, especially when surgery is an integral part of the treatment regimen and often within a very tight timescale between chemotherapy cycles.</p>
                        <p>Psychological support for patients and families with cancer is of paramount importance (Macmillan Cancer Support 2011). The diagnosis of cancer in itself is frightening; however, when you are then given a diagnosis that you have probably never heard of, or known anyone with the same, it can be even more challenging. The Internet is a growing resource for information and can be very useful, but can also be extremely confusing and frightening for patients and their families. If a patient searches ‘sarcoma’ the result will be several million hits and the information available is not always in a format that meets the patient’s needs. It is therefore important for appropriate information to be given regarding the disease and a treatment plan in a carefully considered and timely fashion with specialist nursing support. Sarcoma support groups are also available for patients and their families, although this is a personal choice and not all patients are happy to take part. General psychological support for cancer patients is available in cancer centres, but this service is not always easily accessible so specialist nurses and other sarcoma professionals are crucial to the provision of the appropriate psychological support of sarcoma patients.</p>

                        <p>Specialist nursing in cancer care has been found to be of great benefit to both patients and families (National Cancer Action Team 2010). These roles allow a continuity of care to patients at a time when they may feel very ‘out of control’ following a cancer diagnosis. The roles are mainly supportive and advisory; however some of the roles do include hands-on care also, especially in a chemotherapy setting. Specialist nursing roles can be health service funded or funded by cancer charities, for example Macmillan Cancer Support or Marie Curie in the UK. See Box 15.3 for discussion of the value of specialist roles.</p>

                            <p>‘In October 2010 I was diagnosed with a sarcoma in my left calf, a very rare cancerous tumour which was high grade and aggressive. I was immediately faced with the likelihood that I was about to undergo surgery which could result in part amputation of my left leg. Upon visiting the [hospital where my treatment would take place] beforehand, my family and I met Sarah, a specialist Macmillan Nurse. We were all touched by Sarah’s incredibly positive, sensitive nature straight away, and we knew that we were in good hands. She gave us her contact details during the first meeting, and told us to contact her with any query or problem, at any time.</p>
                            <p>Sarah, together with Jane (Sarah’s colleague), provided a high level of support during the process of diagnosis, hospital admittance and after care. Whenever we were in need of advice and help in any way, Sarah and Jane would always reply to our calls or emails and gave 110% to resolve every issue every time. Their help and guidance helped to speed up my recovery after surgery and radiotherapy.</p>
                            <p>Following the dedication and world class expertise of everyone in the Sarcoma Unit, we are now living life normally again. Thankfully, my leg is completely intact, after undergoing 5 hours of intensive surgery last October, although I was told afterwards that the margins were very narrow. I have now carefully resumed my favourite sport of mountain biking.</p>
                            <p>My family and I have felt so fortunate to have such a compassionate and professional team to support us with my fight against this cruel and indiscriminate illness. We would like to thank Sarah, Jane and everybody in the [hospital] for everything that they have done for us, and for their continued care.’ James (age 37)</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Sarcoma follow-up, as with most cancer follow-up regimes, is a regular process of having scans and X-rays undertaken to assess for recurrent/metastatic disease and a clinical examination. The following shows a typical follow-up pathway for patients who have had surgery and/or radiotherapy for sarcoma:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>2-week following surgery histology and wound check review</li>
                            <li>3-month follow-up with baseline MRI and chest X-ray and clinical examination</li>
                            <li>3-monthly reviews up to year two with chest X-ray and clinical examination at each appointment</li>
                            <li>6-monthly reviews up to year five with chest X-ray and clinical examination at each appointment</li>
                            <li>Annual review with chest X-ray and clinical examination at each appointment up to year ten.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Patients who are receiving, or have received, chemotherapy may have a slightly increased rate of follow-up. If at any point during the follow-up plan the patient should have signs of recurrent or metastatic disease they should automatically have MRI/CT scan undertaken and if disease is confirmed they would be treated accordingly. Patients with high grade disease at presentation are more likely to go on to develop disease recurrence or metastatic disease; it cannot be ruled out for any sarcoma patient, hence the need for regular follow up.</p>
                        <p>A diagnosis of recurrent or metastatic disease can be as devastating for a patient and family as their original diagnosis was. The support needed by them can be much more intense than previously and professionals may find that patients given a subsequent diagnosis become even more anxious. Treatment for recurrent or metastatic disease is decided on an individual basis, taking into account the amount of disease present, its anatomical site and the age of the patient. It is in the metastatic setting that more chemotherapy may be used than in the initial primary treatment, especially for soft tissue sarcoma, and is discussed on an individual basis. In some cases the specialist teams will need to discuss with some patients and families that treatment is no longer an option and this is where specialist palliative care teams are involved to ensure the patient and family receive the supportive care they require.</p>

                        <p>Palliative care for bone sarcoma patients will be needed when there is no cure for the disease and patients begin to suffer symptoms. The input from palliative care providers is crucial to ensure end of life care needs are met. Often, palliative care services are happy to be contacted prior to the patient needing any input so that contact can be made and the start of a relationship can be sought. Palliative care can be undertaken in a number of settings:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In the hospital setting palliative care can be provided by the ward staff with or without the input from specialist hospital palliative care nurses. This sometimes has to be undertaken when a patient deteriorates very quickly and it becomes very difficult to transfer them to a hospice or home.</li>
                            <li>In the hospice setting palliative care is undertaken by specialist palliative care staff in a more relaxed, appropriate setting.</li>
                            <li>At home palliative care can be undertaken by family with support from community staff, both general and specialist palliative care.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Hospices can very often provide support prior to any interventional palliative care input being needed. This can include relaxation treatments, music therapy and other services. It is important to discuss with patients and families the value of services which hospices can provide. Some find it very difficult to attend a hospice for supportive care as they feel they ‘only go to a hospice to die’. It is therefore essential to explain the nature of the services that can be provided which other NHS settings are unable to offer.</p>
                        <p>The preferred place of palliative care should be the decision of the patient and family. When patients have had to travel a large distance to have their sarcoma treatment it is often more appropriate for them to receive palliative care in a setting which is closer to home. This allows them to have visits from all family and friends who may not be able to travel. It also allows patients and families to move away from what may have been a time of very intense treatment.</p>

                        <p>It will now be obvious that sarcoma care is not straightforward. The need for definite histological diagnosis is key to ensuring the patients receive the correct treatments for their disease, be it surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination of all three. Due to the fact that sarcoma can affect all age groups and all anatomical sites the need for knowledge about this disease in the general orthopaedic community is high. Care of these patients has to be within the realms of a specialist MDT and be undertaken by specialist teams who are experienced in sarcoma care (Grimer et al., 2010). The importance of early diagnosis cannot be stressed enough. Prognosis depends very much on a diagnosis that is made before metastatic disease has a chance to present. Hopefully by raising awareness of this disease everyone can work towards a common goal of earlier diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>Practitioners working in the specialty of orthopaedics will inevitably care for sarcoma patients or suspected sarcoma patients during their working time. It is important to remember that even though this is a rare disease there are health professionals specialising in sarcoma who are happy to share their knowledge in order to help raise awareness and make the patient pathway a smooth and informed one.
