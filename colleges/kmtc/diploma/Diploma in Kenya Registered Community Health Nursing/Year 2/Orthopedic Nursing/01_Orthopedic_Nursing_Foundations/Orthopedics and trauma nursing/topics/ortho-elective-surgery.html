                        <p>The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of the evidence base for the practice of orthopaedic elective surgical care. Planned, or elective surgery – in particular joint replacement (arthroplasty) – is the main focus of orthopaedic work. Elective surgery is a major life event for patients and they have high expectations of a successful operation and recovery. Orthopaedic practitioners play a key role in ensuring that patients are fully prepared for surgery and that they are supported during the perioperative and post-operative recovery period. Such surgery is resource intensive in terms of healthcare delivery and achieving the best outcomes as well as the best possible experience for patients is central.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The focus of care provision and the key care principles of elective surgery are firmly rooted in the ethos of safe and high quality service delivery as these are central in ensuring positive outcomes. The recent introduction of enhanced recovery programmes (ECPs), also referred to as rapid recovery, aims to optimise outcomes and improve patient experience through evidence-based pathways of care. A key element is striving to empower patients so that they become partners in their care (Driver et al., 2012). There are four working principles of enhanced recovery:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Every patient is included in a pathway designed to enhance their recovery.</li>
                            <li>Preoperative preparation places the patient in the best possible condition for their surgery, helps to identify risks and instigates rehabilitation either before admission or soon after.</li>
                            <li>Patient management is pro-active and is evident across the whole pathway.</li>
                            <li>Patients play an active role and take responsibility for enhancing their recovery (DOH 2011).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>In elective orthopaedic surgery settings, enhanced recovery pathways have been developed particularly for patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. The main focusses are patient preparation and identifying and minimising risk. Patient empowerment is central to this and is promoted through:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>good communication</li>
                            <li>shared decision making</li>
                            <li>education and information</li>
                            <li>support for patients/family members/carers</li>
                            <li>advice resources</li>
                            <li>clinician engagement</li>
                            <li>patient engagement.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Communication</h3>
                        <p>Communication is a vital tool for the delivery of safe and quality care and is a key priority for the multidisciplinary team. Effective communication helps to develop partnerships between service providers and service users. Patients must be kept informed about their treatment and be involved in decisions about their care. Good communication helps to manage patient expectations and make the care pathway less stressful, helping to promote a sense of control so the patient is more able to participate in the recovery process.</p>

                        <h3>Shared decision making</h3>
                        <p>Shared decision making has become a prominent feature in the drive to achieve good healthcare outcomes. Decisions relating to treatment have traditionally been undertaken by clinicians although this practice is gradually evolving to include patient involvement in partnership with clinicians (Slover et al., 2012). Collaboration between patient and clinician aims to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>improve health outcomes</li>
                            <li>empower the patient</li>
                            <li>improve knowledge</li>
                            <li>increase awareness of the benefits of treatment</li>
                            <li>adjust unrealistic expectations</li>
                            <li>alert patients to the degree of acceptable risks</li>
                            <li>improve compliance with treatment</li>
                            <li>improve satisfaction with care.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Within elective orthopaedic surgery shared decision making models have emerged in which clinicians and patients work together to decide on the best treatment option. This is seen as an important approach to joint replacement surgery (O’Neill et al., 2007). There are three important components of shared decision-making:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Clinical assessment and evaluation</strong> - help the clinician to present information based upon clinical findings about treatment options.</li>
                            <li><strong>Patient perception</strong> - every patient has a perception of their condition that is unique; everything they hear, see or experience is specific to them. It is important that the healthcare professional appreciates the patient’s viewpoint, decision and subsequent physical, psychological and social affect that any treatment may have upon them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Decision aids</strong> - offer evidence-based impartial information about the treatment options for specific conditions (Fung et al., 2008), particularly in circumstances where there may be uncertainty about the best treatment option. They present the patient with the risks and benefits of each option to help them to understand the benefits and risks.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Other important aspects of care provision include:</p>

                        <h3>Education and Information</h3>
                        <p>Education and the provision of information are key to ensuring that patients are prepared physically and psychologically for their surgery. This is considered in more detail in the section on preoperative preparation.</p>

                        <h3>Support and advice</h3>
                        <p>Involving and encouraging family member or carer participation can play a significant role in reinforcing the principles of enhanced recovery by helping to instil confidence prior to admission and following discharge from hospital and providing a means of support when the patient is no longer in direct contact with members of their healthcare team. Some hospitals provide peer support groups where patients can meet and chat with others who have had similar surgery. Additional support can also be provided by dedicated contact points at the unit where surgery will or has taken place. Information concerning advice and who to contact should be provided to all patients during every stage of their care pathway and on discharge from hospital.</p>

                        <h3>Clinician engagement</h3>
                        <p>Engaging clinical staff is critical to the success of enhanced recovery pathways and involves factors such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>team work - including collaborative working between primary and secondary care staff</li>
                            <li>staff education and training</li>
                            <li>developing and working to agreed protocols i.e. standardising anaesthetic or surgical practice</li>
                            <li>identifying clinical champions and leaders</li>
                            <li>recognising that patients are partners in their care</li>
                            <li>audit of pathways and feedback to clinicians</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Patient engagement</h3>
                        <p>Without patient engagement enhanced recovery pathways cannot succeed, and involving them in planning, implementing and evaluating their pathway of care is crucial. Patients need to be encouraged to take ownership of their decision to proceed with surgery emphasising the active role the patient needs to adopt to feel empowered, in control and able to participate actively in their own recovery.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The preoperative phase of elective surgery includes the journey from preoperative assessment, education, admission and discharge planning as well as all the components required in preparation for the surgery itself.</p>
                        <p>If effective, this phase of care can be as instrumental as good surgical technique in positive post-operative outcomes.</p>

                        <h3>Preoperative assessment</h3>
                        <p>As demands for shorter hospital stays increase - driven by cost reductions within healthcare systems - good preoperative assessment is imperative. It ensures that the patient is fully informed about the procedure and the post-operative recovery plan, is in optimum health and has made arrangements for admission, discharge and post-operative care at home.</p>
                        <p>Patients are graded relating to severity of their surgery:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Grade 1 - (minor) e.g. excision of lesion, joint injection</li>
                            <li>Grade 2 - e.g. knee arthroscopy</li>
                            <li>Grade 3 - e.g. lumbar discectomy, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction</li>
                            <li>Grade 4 - (major) e.g. total joint replacement, joint revision.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The patient’s medical/surgical history is assessed using the ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) which grades the patient using a scale in relation to their fitness for undergoing an anaesthetic (adapted from NICE 2003):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>ASA Grade 1</strong> - a normal healthy patient, without any clinically important co-morbidity or clinically significant past/present medical history</li>
                            <li><strong>ASA Grade 2</strong> - a patient with mild systemic disease, e.g. well controlled hypertension/diabetes/asthma</li>
                            <li><strong>ASA Grade 3</strong> - a patient with severe systemic disease, e.g. angina/hypertension/diabetes/COAD/COPD all not well controlled</li>
                            <li><strong>ASA Grade 4</strong> - a patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life</li>
                            <li><strong>ASA Grade 5</strong> - a moribund patient who is not expected to survive without the operation</li>
                            <li><strong>ASA Grade 6</strong> - a patient declared brain-dead and their organs are being harvested for donor purposes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>NICE (2003) make evidence-based recommendations regarding clinical investigations required prior to elective surgery, dependent upon the ASA and surgery grades. The recommendations are formulated into traffic light colour coded tables for uncomplicated decision making (Table 14.1).</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Other important aspects to be considered are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>baseline clinical observations</li>
                            <li>weight and height for drug dosage calculations</li>
                            <li>calculation of body mass index (BMI)</li>
                            <li>list of current medications</li>
                            <li>any allergies or drug sensitivities</li>
                            <li>methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screening of nose, axilla, groin and any wounds</li>
                            <li>Skin integrity and potential for peri- and/or postsurgery skin breakdown</li>
                            <li>oral/dental checks for decay or disease.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Preoperative education</h3>
                        <p>Preoperative education can be provided at the same time as preoperative assessment or in a separate individual or group education session prior to surgery. This has been shown to be more effective than post-admission teaching in terms of patients’ knowledge and retention (Stern and Lockwood 2005; JBI 2010a). The aim is to provide the foundations for effective decision making enabling informed consent, information regarding the procedure itself and post-operative expectations, care and rehabilitation. The knowledge gained can affect the perception of patients’ preparedness for surgery and their ability to control post-operative pain, which therefore improves the patients overall stay (Kearney et al., 2011).</p>
                        <p>Education can be delivered via one-to-one instruction, group sessions, printed information (i.e. booklet, pamphlet, and information sheet), learning package, audio-visual presentation, and lectures or a combination of these methods (Stern and Lockwood 2005; JBI 2010a).</p>
                        <p>Some surgeons now offer structured online courses regarding surgery, whilst other patients choose their own online searches (Kearney et al., 2011). With recent technological initiatives, surgical teams need to cater for the change in trend and provide information via differing mediums, to assess the effectiveness of this teaching tool. Involvement of the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) enables each member of the team to contribute to the patient’s care and prevents duplication.</p>

                        <h3>Discharge planning</h3>
                        <p>The aim of discharge planning is to reduce hospital length of stay, prevent unplanned readmissions and improve the co-ordination of services following discharge from hospital using the discharge plan tailored to the individual patient (Shepperd et al., 2010). Addressing the physical, psychological and social needs of the patient (and their parent or carer) pre-operatively enables discharge to be considered early in the care process with any referrals to MDT or other agencies made early to prevent delays in discharge.</p>

                        <h3>Admission</h3>
                        <p>Admission is dependent upon practice at institution level or surgeon/anaesthetist preference. Patients can be admitted on the day of surgery or one to two days prior if there is significant medical history and high anaesthetic risk; e.g. a patient with emphysema can be admitted up to two days prior to surgery to ensure medical fitness. Admission nursing assessment should focus on the patient’s overall health status and nursing care plans are based on mutually established realistic, clientcentred, measurable, clear and concise goals (JBI 2010a). The admission process requires nurses with specialised knowledge in orthopaedics to ensure that the patient is safely prepared for the operation and provide support as hospital admissions can be traumatic and stressful events (Lucas 2008).</p>

                        <h3>Skin preparation</h3>
                        <p>Antiseptic body wash was historically used as a strategy for the prevention of surgical site infections (SSIs) but there is conflicting evidence surrounding this (JBI 2011a). NICE (2008) clinical guidelines, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI 2011b) and a Cochrane review (Webster and Osborne 2007) all found no clear evidence that the use of chlorhexidine solution before surgery was beneficial, indicating it may not be cost-effective in comparison to detergent or a bar of soap. The recommendation is for patients to shower or bath using soap either the day before or on the day of surgery to clean the skin surface and therefore reduce microbial load. Neither does hair removal reduce the risk of surgical site infection (NICE 2008), although the presence of hair can interfere with the exposure of the incision and subsequent wound, the suturing of the incision and application of adhesive drapes and wound dressings (JBI 2011a). Three methods of hair removal are currently used: shaving, clipping and chemical depilation, and both JBI (2011a) and NICE (2008) recommend the use of electric clippers with a disposable head, ideally on the day of surgery, as shaving can compromise skin integrity and depilation can irritate skin. Hair removal should be completed on the ward rather than operating theatre as loose hair may contaminate the sterile surgical field (Tanner et al., 2006).</p>

                        <h3>Fasting</h3>
                        <p>The principle of fasting from fluids and solids prior to surgery is to reduce the risk of vomiting and aspiration of stomach contents at the induction of general anaesthetic (GA) (Kohyratty et al., 2010). Patients are rarely aware of the rationale for fasting, so this should be included in preoperative education to reduce anxiety. This is considered in more detail in Chapter 10.</p>

                        <h3>Pre-medication</h3>
                        <p>Premedications are given to reduce preoperative anxiety although a sedative pre-medication is not compulsory. A Cochrane systematic review (Smith and Pittaway 2002) found that premedication did not improve the length of stay and the sedated patient may require closer attention for safety and closer monitoring while awaiting surgery. The JBI (2010b) note an absence of clear research findings surrounding the use of anxiolytic premedication in adult patients undergoing day surgery under general anaesthetic, so this should be based on clinical judgement. Patients should take their routine medications prior to surgery unless otherwise advised by the anaesthetist, and surgeons should ask that anti-coagulant medications such as warfarin, aspirin and clopiderol be stopped for at least five days prior to surgery and sometimes replaced with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) dependent upon the patient’s medical history and risk of thromboembolism (Chapter 9).</p>

                        <h3>Consent</h3>
                        <p>Informed consent is legally required, and should be obtained prior to all nursing and medical procedures (Cohn and Larson 2007). Patients must have full understanding of the procedure, the risks and any alternatives that are available and have made the decision of their own free will, without coercion and are legally able to make the decision.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Safety checklist</h3>
                        <p>In 2008, the World Health Organization (Haynes et al., 2009) published guidelines that recommended practices to ensure the safety of surgical patients worldwide. The Surgical Safety Checklist is intended for use by clinicians to improve the safety of operations and reduce unnecessary surgical deaths and complications. The safety checks begin on the ward and once the checklist and documentation is complete, the patient is transferred to the operating department where the perioperative phase commences. See Box 14.1 and Figure 14.1.</p>

                            <p>This large-scale study was conducted in eight hospitals in eight cities (including London, England), representing a variety of economic circumstances and diverse patient populations. The hospitals participated in the WHO’s Safe Surgery Saves Lives programme and implemented a 19-item checklist designed to improve team communication and consistency of care. They hypothesized that this would reduce complications and deaths relating to surgery.</p>
                            <p>The study prospectively studied pre-intervention and postintervention periods at the participating sites. The checklist was introduced via lectures, written materials or written guidance. Patients were followed up prospectively until discharge or for 30 days, whichever came first, for death and complications such as myocardial infarction, wound infection or sepsis. 3733 patients were enrolled during the baseline period and 3955 patients after the post-implementation phase. There were no significant differences between the patients in the two phases of the study. The in-hospital death rate was shown to decrease from 1.5% to 0.8%, and serious complications from 11% to 7% after introduction of the checklist. The overall rates of surgical site infection and unplanned reoperation also declined significantly.</p>
                            <p>The authors acknowledged that the combined effects of team building and cultural changes may also have played a part in the positive results, rather than the checklist on its own.</p>

                        <p>The care of patients in the operating theatre, from arrival in the anaesthetic room to leaving the recovery area requires staff that are skilled and knowledgeable in both orthopaedic and theatre care. While dealing predominantly with surgery requiring inpatient care, the principles are also applicable to day case orthopaedic surgery.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Anaesthetic preparation</h3>
                        <p>The approach to anaesthesia is carefully planned by the anaesthetic team prior to surgery, taking into consideration the patient’s general health status. The patient will also have been informed of these intentions. Anaesthesia allows surgery to take place by rendering the patient insensible to pain and sensation, together with loss of consciousness if a general anaesthetic is used (Woodhead and Wicker 2005). Depending on the type of surgery and the patient characteristics, anaesthesia may be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Local</strong> - only the immediate area is anaesthetised; e.g. a block to allow carpal tunnel surgery to be performed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Regional</strong> - axillary block for hand or forearm surgery (Wing Wai and Irwin 2012) or spinal anaesthetic for lower limb surgery (Royal College of Anaesthetists 2008).</li>
                            <li><strong>General</strong> - the patient is unconscious for the operation. This can be used for all operative procedures in patients who are fit for a general anaesthesia.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For pain relief an epidural anaesthetic or a nerve block may be used in addition to a spinal or general anaesthetic; for example a femoral nerve block for analgesia in total hip replacement surgery.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Intraoperative period</h3>
                        <p>Along with general surgical considerations, effective operating department procedures include ensuring the correct positioning of the patient to allow surgical and anaesthetic access while at the same time maintaining patient dignity and managing risk from harm; for example, shoulder surgery patients can be positioned in an upright/beach chair or supine position (Dutta 2011), resulting in different pressure points. The maintenance of patient safety, temperature, correct patient moving/ handling and infection control measures must also be considered.</p>
                        <p>There are a plethora of roles within the operating theatre which vary according to the way in which operating department practice has developed locally and nationally. Advanced roles in the operating department now include practitioners who have received additional training and education and may assist with retaining retractors, dissect soft tissue/bone, prepare ligament grafts, place intraoperative drains, close wounds and safely transfer the patient from operating table to bed post-surgery (Jones et al., 2012). All practitioners who work within the sterile field need not only to attend to the technical aspects of surgery but also to non-technical skills (Mitchell et al., 2011) including ‘situation awareness’ (watching and anticipating the next stage of the procedure), communication (verbal and nonverbal cues), teamwork (coordinating activities), task management and coping with stress and fatigue (their own and other members of the team). An important consideration for patients having regional anaesthesia is communication during the surgery as they have two overarching needs: wanting to have control (knowledge) and trust in staff (Bergman et al., 2012).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Recovery</h3>
                        <p>After surgery patients should be fully conscious and clinically stable before they return to the ward or are discharged. Transfer of the patient from the operating theatre to the recovery room is an important consideration as transfers from one surface to another involve risk such as dislocation of a hip prosthesis following joint arthroplasty and appropriate equipment such as abduction wedges or pillows may need to be in place to maintain the correct position. The recovery staff will assume responsibility for the patient and care for them according to a model such as ABCDE (Hatfield and Tronson 2009):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>A</strong> - airway</li>
                            <li><strong>B</strong> - breathing</li>
                            <li><strong>C</strong> - circulation</li>
                            <li><strong>D</strong> - drips, drains and drugs</li>
                            <li><strong>E</strong> - extras.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>‘Extra’ considerations may include elevation of a limb and care of a cast or a back slab (Chapter 8). Peripheral neurovascular observations are necessary following limb surgery and where casts/traction are being used (Chapters 8 and 9).</p>
                        <p>Recovery occurs in stages and can be characterised as Stages 1-3 (Hatfield and Tronson, 2009):</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Stage 1</strong> - patients have just left the theatre and are expected to stay in the recovery room for one hour following general anaesthesia and half an hour after local anaesthesia. Vital signs, nausea/pain, conscious level and output from drains or bleeding from wound sites should be monitored and any abnormalities reported to the anaesthetist and/or surgeon. Operations performed under tourniquet such as limb surgery may result in up to one litre of blood loss in the recovery room, requiring careful monitoring along with checking of vacuum drains. Thirty minutes should elapse before the last dose of opioid analgesia and discharge from the recovery room.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stage 2</strong> - relates to transfer of patients to the ward once vital signs are stable, the patient is conscious, pain is controlled and there is no excessive wound drainage or bleeding. Transfer should take place with portable suction, oxygen and other emergency equipment available. Some elective orthopaedic patients will be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for extended Stage 1 recovery. A review of 22000 primary and revision THR patients found that 130 were admitted to ICU and that independent risk factors were smoking, cemented arthroplasty, general anaesthesia, allogeneic transfusion, higher C-reactive protein, lower haemoglobin level, higher body mass index and older age (AbdelSalam et al., 2012). Whatever the transfer destination, it is important that the receiving staff have a comprehensive handover including operation performed, surgeon’s instructions, intraoperative details such as blood loss, anaesthetic type, condition in recovery and checking of the wound dressing, drains and any other drains or infusions by the receiving staff (Woodhead and Wicker 2005).</li>
                            <li><strong>Stage 3</strong> - discharge home and longer-term follow up. For day case procedures this happens when vital signs have been stable for at least one hour, pain is adequately controlled, there is an absence of nausea/vomiting and the patient is able to drink, eat and pass urine.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The drive for shorter hospitalisation post-surgery means that patients more frequently return directly to the ward environment instead of an ICU or High Dependency Unit (HDU). This enables continuity of care as the nursing staff can monitor the patient through regular observation and, if the patient is physically fit, haemodynamically stable and spinal anaesthetic or nerve blocks have worn off, they can commence mobilisation on the day of surgery (day 0). This enables the patient to use the new joint, reducing risk of VTE and chest infection as the patient is not lying supine in bed. Effective post-operative care involves:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>monitoring of clinical observations in accordance with policy and appropriately recorded onto EWS/ MEWS chart (Chapter 16)</li>
                            <li>assessment of neurovascular status bilaterally (Chapter 9)</li>
                            <li>management of pain (Chapter 11)</li>
                            <li>monitoring of input (oral and IV)/output (vomitus, urinary and blood loss) via fluid balance chart, especially in the first 24 hours (Chapter 10)</li>
                            <li>assessment and management of wound/dressings/ drains (Chapter 12)</li>
                            <li>encourage deep breathing exercises and initiate chest physiotherapy if required to prevent chest infection</li>
                            <li>encourage leg exercises to reduce risk of DVT, and administer VTE prophylaxis (Chapter 9)</li>
                            <li>initiate mobilisation and rehabilitation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Blood replacement</h3>
                        <p>Blood loss during orthopaedic surgery is unavoidable, particularly during THR and transfusion of blood is sometimes required. There are currently three techniques available for transfusing blood within the orthopaedic setting:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>allogeneic;</strong> blood from an unrelated donor</li>
                            <li><strong>cell salvage;</strong> collecting blood from the patient during surgery for transfusion during or after surgery</li>
                            <li><strong>perioperative autologous donation (PAD)</strong> - the collection of patients’ own blood prior to surgery for transfusion if required (Carless et al., 2010).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Allogeneic blood transfusion in elective orthopaedic surgery is risky and best avoided. PAD is justified in patients who have developed immune responses because of repeated transfusions or in situations where there is doubt about the safety of the blood supply. It is also believed to reduce the need for transfusions of donor blood and is safer than receiving an allogeneic transfusion (Carless et al., 2010; Henry et al., 2001; JBI 2010c). A Cochrane review suggested that cell salvage reduces the need for allogeneic red cell transfusion and did not appear to impact adversely on clinical outcomes (Carless et al., 2010). Many alternative strategies are currently being employed to reduce the number of transfusions required including anti-fibrinolytic compounds such as aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent, which effectively blocks this fibrinolytic activity, causing a marked reduction in post-operative bleeding (Sepah et al., 2011).</p>
                        <h3>Discharge planning/rehabilitation</h3>
                        <p>There is increasing pressure for discharge from hospital as early as possible. Nurses are in the key position of coordinating discharges in collaboration with the MDT, patient and family. Planning commences in the preoperative phase as delayed discharges and prolonged hospitalisation can place the patient at additional risk and there are financial and efficiency implications for the service. Good practice requires units to develop standards, protocols and audit tools in order to monitor the quality of discharges. Such criteria relate to physical, psychological and social benchmarks (RCN 2013):</p>
                        <h4>Physical criteria</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>conscious level and orientation should be consistent with preoperative state</li>
                            <li>haemodynamically stable or similar to preoperative status</li>
                            <li>tolerating food and fluids orally, nausea and vomiting should be minimal</li>
                            <li>urinary catheter removed and micturition has occurred</li>
                            <li>pain under control and patient given sufficient oral analgesia for discharge</li>
                            <li>minimal surgical site bleeding. Patient should be given instructions on wound care or appropriate referral to community nursing teams or GP surgery to follow-up</li>
                            <li>mobility using appropriate aids to a level dependent upon surgery and physiotherapy goals achieved</li>
                            <li>X-rays reviewed by surgical team confirming correct placement of prosthesis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Psychological criteria</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide information regarding recovery at home both verbal and written.</li>
                            <li>Follow-up appointment instructions should be given to the patient or their parent/carer, e.g. removal of sutures or clips, outpatient physiotherapy and consultant review.</li>
                            <li>Check appropriate discharge medication has been provided; patient/carer may need support and guidance on administration. Pay particular attention to VTE prophylaxis and highlight importance.</li>
                            <li>Contact telephone numbers should be given to the patient or their parent/carer both for emergency and continuing care.</li>
                            <li>General practitioner (GP) letter should be given to the patient/carer or posted depending on unit policy.</li>
                            <li>Next-day visit from a community nurse or telephone call either from the community team or as an extended role of the hospital-based team.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Social criteria</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Suitable transport home - not public transport.</li>
                            <li>Home environment suitable for the patient following the procedure/surgery undertaken, equipment in place prior to time of discharge if possible.</li>
                            <li>Parent/carer/support network arrangements made for taking time off work or arranging care of children and even pets to reduce initial stress during recovery period.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Patient education/health promotion</h3>
                        <p>Patients are expected to continue care at home following discharge so they and significant others must understand and remember the health and treatment information provided (Johnson et al., 2003). The patient is expected to continue exercises and progress mobility although timescales will differ for each individual. Other issues include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hip replacement dislocation precautions - avoid bending >90 degrees; avoid adduction (crossing operative leg over midline); avoid internal/external rotation or twisting.</li>
                            <li>Knee replacement - elevate the leg and apply ice to knee to relieve swelling. Kneeling can be problematic due to numbness.</li>
                            <li>Inform dentist of prosthetic joint as antibiotic cover is required for any procedures lasting >30 minutes due to risk of bacterial infection.</li>
                            <li>Metal detectors have varying sensitivity and can alarm, therefore a medic alert card indicating an artificial joint provided by hospital or surgical team.</li>
                            <li>Details of implant size and type is provided to National Joint Register with the patient’s consent.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are some significant problems that may arise and require urgent treatment. Patients and carers should be aware of these and the resulting consequences if not reported or acted upon:</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The decision to undertake surgery may have taken place after many months or years of conservative measures such as physiotherapy and various medications prior to agreeing to elective surgical intervention. Much orthopaedic surgery is conducted for joint arthropathies such as osteoarthritis (Chapter 13) and bone, joint and soft tissue deformities and conditions. While there are many types of orthopaedic surgery the elective orthopaedic procedures discussed in this chapter will focus on the principles of care following surgery and on the most commonly performed procedures: joint replacement surgery and spinal decompression.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Arthroplasty or total joint replacement (TJR)</h3>
                        <p>Arthroplasty refers to the surgical refashioning of a joint. It aims to relieve pain and to retain or restore movement, is considered to be one of the most successful operations in orthopaedic surgery and is well established. Arthroplasty surgery has become available for almost every joint with the hip and knee being the joint most frequently replaced. People are living longer and consequently the incidence of osteoarthritis is increasing. It is a debilitating condition that negatively affects quality of life. The aim of arthroplasty is to resolve pain and disability by removing diseased components of joints and replacing them with dynamically stable material such as metal, plastic or ceramics. Over many years replacement of most joints has become possible, but the most commonly performed surgery is total hip and total knee replacement.</p>
                        <p>It is anticipated that a hip or knee replacement should last for 10-15 years. National Joint Registries provide a central database for hip, knee, elbow, shoulder and ankle replacements which provide statistics related to patient outcomes and complications in a ‘... continuous drive to improve the quality of outcomes and ensure the quality and cost-effectiveness of joint replacement surgery.’ (NJR 2012 p. 15). Annual reports enable sharing of important data and clinical evidence with clinicians, helping surgeons to choose the best implants for their patients as well as understand joint replacement survivorship (how long a device lasts before it needs replacing or modifying).</p>
                        <p>Different types of arthroplasty include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Excision arthroplasty</strong> - the bone surfaces are removed and the space between them is allowed to fill with fibrous tissues. It is the simplest and sometimes most satisfactory arthroplasty but leaves an unstable joint. An excision arthroplasty of the hip is called a Girdlestone’s procedure. It is most often used as a salvage procedure for a failed total hip replacement. The patient’s leg will be shorter as a result of this surgery.</li>
                            <li><strong>Replacement hemiarthroplasty</strong> - only one surface of the joint is replaced with an artificial material such as metal. An example is a Thompson’s hemiarthroplasty used for some patients with a hip fracture (Chapter 18).</li>
                            <li><strong>Arthroplasty or total joint replacement (TJR)</strong> usually performed to relieve pain, improve function and reduce the degree of disability for a patient suffering with a degenerative, inflammatory or traumatic condition. TJR is the surgical treatment of choice when conservative treatments are not successful in managing the pain (Schoen 2009). Articular bone ends are replaced by prosthetic implants. Prostheses are made from a variety of materials including: stainless steel, chrome/cobalt, titanium alloy, and high density polyethylene.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Prostheses can either be cemented or uncemented into position. In the case of THR, new generations of total hip prostheses are currently being tested including metal-on-metal, ceramic-on-ceramic and metal-on-ceramic in the hope that they have the potential to improve outcomes for longer periods of time, but their efficacy currently remains uncertain (Pivec et al., 2012).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Hip surgery - THR and hip resurfacing</h3>
                        <p>A total hip replacement is the most commonly performed elective orthopaedic procedure. Its primary functions are to treat hip pain and disability caused by diseases such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. It is occasionally performed for patient with a hip fracture (Chapter 18).</p>
                        <p>THR surgery involves the dislocation of the hip joint so that the femoral head and any damaged cartilage in the acetabulum can be removed. This is achieved through a 20-30 cm surgical incision allowing dissection of soft tissue, muscle and joint capsule. Incisions may be lateral, antero-lateral or posterior. A lateral or antero-lateral approach preserves the posterior part of the joint capsule thus reducing the risk of posterior dislocation of the prosthesis post-operatively. However these approaches necessitate the splitting of the abductor muscles which can lead to an increased incidence of postoperative limp and muscle weakness. A posterior approach weakens the posterior joint capsule with a greater risk of dislocation but the abductor muscles are not split.</p>
                        <p>Minimally invasive total hip replacement aims to avoid damage to the muscles and tendons around the hip joint. A single or double incision of 10 cm or less in length is made. Division of muscles is less extensive than in standard approaches and specially designed retractors and customised instruments are used. However, longer-term results of surgery using a smaller incision are not yet available and there are concerns about increased prosthesis malpositioning and transient lateral femoral cutaneous nerve palsy due to reduced visibility of the joint during surgery.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of surgical technique the joint is prepared and the prosthesis inserted in a similar way. After removal of the femoral head the femur is prepared by reaming a hole down its medullary canal so that the femoral component can be fitted; this may be cemented in place or be cementless (press-fit). The acetabular socket is prepared to receive the cup in which the femoral component rotates; this may also be cemented or cementless. The surgeon aims to achieve equal leg length but on occasions there is a leg length discrepancy, either a shorter or longer operated leg, because of the extent of bone loss due to disease or because of the need to ensure a stable joint. Patients should be made aware of this possibility prior to surgery. After insertion of the femoral and acetabular components the hip joint is then put through the full range of movement in order to test for stability before the joint capsule and overlying muscles are sewn up.</p>
                        <p>The total hip replacement may need revision after 10-15 years due to aseptic loosening of the prosthetic joint and/or cement cracking although for many patients the prosthesis may last much longer. Occasionally a revision is needed earlier due to infection or aseptic loosening of the prosthesis causing pain and discomfort.</p>
                        <p>Revision surgery is more complex than the primary THR and is usually performed by specialist surgeons. The procedure involves opening the joint, removing the prosthetic components and any bone cement followed by a reconstruction of the joint using new prosthetic components. Bone grafting may be indicated. For an infected prosthesis surgery is conducted in two stages; the first stage is removal of the infected prosthesis and treatment with antibiotics, usually intravenously. Once it has been established that the infection has been eradicated the second stage is carried out: insertion of the new prosthesis.</p>
                        <p>Hip resurfacing involves the resurfacing of the femoral head with a titanium shell. A long incision, often longer than a traditional THR incision, is required because although the hip is dislocated in order to expose the femoral head, this is not removed but rather smoothed to fit the shell on top so it is not as easy to visualise the acetabulum, which is reamed and fitted with a metal cup. This procedure is used for younger patients with osteoarthritis who may need a THR in the future as it aims to reduce pain, restore function and delay the need for a THR for some years. Hip resurfacing and largediameter metal-on-metal THR reduce the risk of dislocation because the contact area between the components is greater. They also have less debris due to wear.</p>
                        <p>There is some emerging evidence that hip resurfacing and metal-on-metal THRs have a higher revision rate than conventional THR and that metallic debris may cause periprosthetic soft tissue reactions leading to prosthesis failure. There are also concerns that the metal debris may cause elevated metal ions systemically leading to metal toxicity and possibly cancer, though the evidence is not conclusive. The fears have led to a decline in the use of metal-on-metal prostheses, especially in women of childbearing years as there some evidence that metal ions can cross the placenta.</p>
                        <p>Specific post-operative nursing care after THR or hip resurfacing is related to reducing the risk of dislocation, mobilisation and psychological recovery. The prevalence of dislocation varies but is around 4% (Smith et al., 2012). It tends to occur either in the first three months, due to component malposition or abductor deficiency, or many years postoperatively secondary to prosthesis wear. A triangular shaped abduction wedge, often known as a Charnley wedge, is used in some centres to prevent abnormal hip movements for the first few days after surgery. To reduce the risk of dislocation patients are taught:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>not to flex their hip joint more than ninety degrees,</li>
                            <li>to avoid excessive adduction of the leg and</li>
                            <li>to avoid twisting on the leg when turning.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>They are often advised to sleep on their back for the first six weeks and are provided with a raise for their bed and chair as well as a raised toilet seat to prevent hip flexion greater than ninety degrees. There is some evidence to suggest that such precautions may not be necessary and that patients should be allowed more freedom of movement, especially following an anterior or anterolateral surgical approach (Restrepo et al., 2011).</p>
                        <p>Within enhanced recovery programmes early mobilisation is encouraged and in some centres the physiotherapists will get the patient out of bed in the recovery room. The point at which a patient is mobilised is tailored to the individual and influenced by additional factors such as spinal anesthesia and pain management modality. The majority of patients are allowed to fully weight bear immediately, although if there is any potential instability a period of 6-12 weeks non- or partialweight bearing may be ordered. Patients initially mobilise with a walking frame or sticks for up to six weeks, although in some centres patients may stop using them earlier. Physiotherapy is rarely needed after discharge from acute care but postoperative exercises should be performed by patients up to three times per day for at least six weeks.</p>
                        <p>THR surgery is a major life event and preoperative education should have prepared patients for the extended recovery period, which may be 3-6 months. This may need reinforcing after surgery as patients experience the reality of initial restricted mobility and discomfort from the surgery.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Total knee replacement (TKR) surgery</h3>
                        <p>The most common indication for a total knee replacement is osteoarthritis of the knee joint. The most commonly used incision is midline with a medial parapatellar approach, with the patella and extensor mechanism everted to gain access to the joint. The miniincision total knee replacement involves an incision 10 to 12 cm long over the knee, compared with the conventional total knee replacement which requires an incision 20 to 30 cm long. The same prostheses are inserted using specially designed instruments (NICE, 2010). The tibial plateaux and the distal femoral joint surfaces are resected and holes are then drilled in the bones so that the prostheses can be inserted. The tibial joint surface is replaced by a polyethylene bearing, usually attached to a metal base prosthesis and the distal femur with a metal prosthesis. Any arthritis on the patella surface may be removed and a plastic component, like a button, inserted although this is not always performed. The patella is then flipped back into position and the incision closed. As with THR, aseptic loosening of the knee prosthesis may require revision surgery after 10-15 years, or earlier due to infection.</p>
                        <p>For some individuals only part of the knee may be affected by arthritis and a partial or unicompartmental knee replacement may be indicated. This can be performed for younger patients who do not wish to undergo a more invasive TKR. However there is a risk that the patient may develop arthritic changes in the remaining aspects of the knee requiring a conversion to a total knee replacement. Unicondylar knee replacements were around five times more likely to be revised for pain than were cemented total knee replacements (NJR, 2012). Another reason for revision of unicondylar knee replacements is loosening of the prosthesis.</p>
                        <p>After TKR or unicondylar knee replacement it is important that the knee joint is mobilised so that flexion and extension can be maximised. For the majority of patients this can be achieved with exercises supervised by physiotherapy and nursing staff but for others a continuous passive movement (CPM) machine may be used. The leg is secured to the CPM machine on the bed which slowly flexes and extends the knee joint. The evidence suggests that there is little advantage in the medium or long term of using a CPM machine for the majority of patients and that its use should be restricted to patients with poor preoperative knee movement who may find it difficult to flex and extend the knee post-operatively.</p>
                        <p>Patients can normally fully weight bear immediately after surgery unless there is any instability in the joint, which may necessitate a period of partial weight bearing and/or the wearing of a removable splint. The use of crutches or a stick for the first 4-6 weeks may be helpful in providing support, although not all centres advocate this. Optimum recovery may take up to 12 months but at that stage 10-15% of patients are not satisfied with the results of surgery, often because of unrealistic expectations such as being able to kneel on the prosthesis.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Shoulder arthroplasty</h3>
                        <p>A shoulder replacement is indicated for patients with a painful shoulder and destruction of the glenohumeral joint. Glenohumeral arthroplasty is performed for degenerative joint disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory arthropathy, osteoarthritis or fractures of the proximal humerus. Other reasons may be due to avascular necrosis of the humeral head, malor non-union of a proximal humeral fracture and chronic deficiency of the rotator cuff (Lucas 2005). The procedure can be successful at reducing the pain from arthritis, but due to the complexity of the shoulder joint, function and mobility are not as successful as with a THR or TKR at this time.</p>
                        <p>There are different types of shoulder replacement surgery. A total shoulder replacement (TSR) involves replacing the arthritic joint surfaces with a humeral component consisting of a metal ball with a stem fixed into the humerus and a plastic glenoid component. The humeral component may be cemented or uncemented; the glenoid component is generally cemented. A shoulder hemiarthroplasty consists of a stemmed humeral component articulating on the natural glenoid cavity and is suitable for patients with a healthy glenoid cavity. Surface replacement arthroplasty in the form of a small metal cap placed over the humeral head is gaining popularity as it is less invasive and can be used for patients with earlier stages of shoulder joint degeneration. The aim of shoulder resurfacing arthroplasty is to replace only the damaged joint surfaces, with minimal bone resection. A reverse TSR is used for patients who have a torn rotator cuff, severe arthritis and a torn rotator cuff or a previous failed TSR. The metal ball is attached to the glenoid cavity and the plastic socket to the humerus. This allows the patient to move the arm using the deltoid muscle rather than the torn rotator cuff. This is a relatively new type of procedure and long-term results are not therefore available. In the short term there are higher complication rates than a conventional TSR due to loosening and dislocation.</p>
                        <p>For these types of surgery a deltopectoral or anterosuperior surgical approach is used. The deltoid muscle is split to expose the shoulder joint. Depending on the exact nature of the surgery the glenoid and humerus are prepared, which may involve a hole being drilled in the bone. Post-operatively there is a risk of dislocation as the shoulder joint is shallow and the articulating surfaces do not fit as closely as in the hip joint. It remains important to maintain the mobility of the joint so exercises are usually started the day after surgery. Initially these are passive - the physiotherapist, nurse or patient (using their other hand) move the joint gently through its range of movement and the patient bends forward and allows the arm to dangle down and swing at ninety degrees without any local muscle activity. Functional hand use at table height is also usually allowed. Patients would normally wear a sling to support the arm between periods of exercise. After approximately six weeks more active exercises can be introduced to strengthen the muscles surrounding the prosthesis.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Spinal surgery</h3>
                        <p>Musculoskeletal injuries and conditions affecting the spine are amongst the most debilitating of all health care events (Smith 2005). Many spinal conditions can progress to requiring surgical intervention. Spinal stenosis may result in spinal decompression being indicated and intervertebral disc disease may lead to a spinal decompression.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Spinal decompression</h4>
                        <p>There are different techniques used to perform spinal decompression. The goal is to ensure a careful freeing of the affected nerves by removal of bone, disc and facet capsule causing the narrowing of the canal. Options include (Smith 2005):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>discectomy:</strong> for a herniated disc</li>
                            <li><strong>laminotomy:</strong> to open up more space posteriorly in the spinal canal by partial removal of the posterior part of the vertebral bone</li>
                            <li><strong>laminectomy:</strong> removal of posterior part of vertebral bone</li>
                            <li><strong>foraminotomy:</strong> widening of the opening where the nerve roots leave the spinal canal</li>
                            <li><strong>spinal fusion:</strong> fusing of adjacent vertebra using bone grafting or screws/rods/plates. Often necessary when multi-level laminectomy is carried out in order to provide spinal stability.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Following a spinal decompression, Smith (2005) recommends the patient may be nursed in a flat position with one pillow under the head and neck unless otherwise indicated by the medical team. An alternative position is to lie on their side, with knees bent and a pillow between the legs. A pillow may also be placed under the knees for support when sleeping supine. The patient should however avoid sleeping in the prone position (Smith 2005). The patient will be assessed pre-operatively for the risk of venous thromboembolism and appropriate actions must be implemented to minimise the risk post-operatively (NICE 2010). Nursing actions may include the measuring and fitting of thromboembolitic deterrent stockings (TEDS) for the patient, ensuring an adequate fluid intake, foot, ankle and breathing exercises along with early mobilisation. The medical team will consider the pharmacological anticoagulation medication required.</p>
                        <p>Analgesia will be prescribed and administered regularly following an individual patient pain assessment and the pain management must be reviewed with the patient and the medical team regularly (Smith and Roberts 2011). Patients are mobilised once the effects of the anaesthetic have disappeared and the patient has been assessed as able to mobilise with support from the healthcare team initially. Pressure ulcer assessment and prevention is ongoing to reduce any untoward pressure ulcers from forming (NICE 2005). When getting up from the bed, the patient should turn to the side, using their arms to push up while the legs should swing over the side of the bed. Any movements that will twist the neck or lower spine should be avoided (Smith 2005).</p>
                        <p>Fluids and diet will be encouraged once the patient feels able to tolerate them. Following any surgery to the body, nourishment is required to aid the healing of the surgical wound. The wound usually has a simple postoperative dressing and must be checked regularly for any leakage. The patient’s fluid input and output must be monitored closely and documented. Attention to the patient’s bowel action following surgery is also required. Alongside this all vital signs will be undertaken, documented and any abnormalities must be reported promptly to senior nursing and/or medical staff (Smith and Roberts 2011). Neurovascular observations of the limbs is undertaken and documented (Judge 2007, Department of Health 2010, NMC 2011).</p>
                        <p>Depending on the complexity of the surgery, the patient may be well enough to leave hospital 1-10 days later. The patient will need to avoid strenuous activities for around six weeks. Most people can return to work after this time (NHS Choices 2013).</p>

                        <p>Elective orthopaedic surgery encompasses a range of procedures from day case surgery such as knee arthroscopy to joint replacements requiring in-patient stay. However the principles of care remain the same. Patients benefit from surgery if they are involved in the decision to operate and are fully prepared for what will happen to them along the patient pathway. Orthopaedic nurses can play a key role in ensuring systems are in place, such as Joint Schools, to allow this preparation to occur. Fitness for surgery and anaesthesia also needs to be established and can be achieved through nurse-led preoperative assessment. Orthopaedic theatre staff require skills and knowledge not only in perioperative nursing but also in orthopaedic care if they are to play a full part in maximising the benefits of surgery for the patient. Key orthopaedic principles such as correct moving and handling and early detection of potential complications such as peripheral neurovascular deficit are vital skills for theatre staff. In the recovery phase of elective orthopaedic surgery patients require skilled care from orthopaedic nurses who are knowledgeable about the normal recovery pathway and can act if any abnormalities occur.</p>
