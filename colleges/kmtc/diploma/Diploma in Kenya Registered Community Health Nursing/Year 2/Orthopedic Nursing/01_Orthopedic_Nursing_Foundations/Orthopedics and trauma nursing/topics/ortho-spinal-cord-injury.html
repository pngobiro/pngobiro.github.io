                        <p>The care of the individual following spinal cord injury (SCI) is complex and often provided by specialist practitioners. Sometimes, however, it is provided in general hospitals by practitioners who care for people with SCI rarely or intermittently. This chapter, therefore, aims to provide an overview of the care required from the time of injury and initial management, considering care needs through to rehabilitation and the planning for initial reintegration back into the community. The chapter will focus on the essential role of the nurse in this process as part of the wider multidisciplinary team (MDT) and will provide practitioners working in orthopaedic and musculoskeletal trauma settings with the evidence, guidance and knowledge required to underpin effective practice for the person with SCI.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A spinal injury is often referred to as damage to the spinal column, the rigid support structure composed of the spinal vertebrae. There is also a risk that such a spinal injury can lead to damage to the cord and become a spinal cord injury (SCI). This is a life changing, catastrophic event that can result in partial or complete paralysis/neurological loss affecting the limbs and the autonomic nervous system.</p>
                        <p>Incidence, prevalence and demographics of SCI vary worldwide. There are said to be 40000-60000 people living with SCI in the UK (BASCIS 2006). Data collection varies internationally and incidence is usually estimated per million of the population. It is estimated that in the USA such injuries affect 40 per million of the population (National Spinal Cord Injury Statistics Centre, 2012) and approximately 15 per million in Australia (Norton 2009). It is relatively rare and has a reasonably good life expectancy as understanding and management of the condition grows. The financial, personal and societal costs of the complications of SCI, however, are considerable and initial trauma management, complication prevention and the care provided from the time of injury to reintegration into the community are central in ensuring the best outcomes for the patient and family. This presents significant challenges to practitioners.</p>
                        <p>Developments in the ways in which SCI care is organised locally around the world play an important part in how patient care is managed, enabling continued improvements in care through knowledge and skill development and the use of research, audit and monitoring of care pathways to ensure that care is provided at the point of need in a timely and effective manner to avoid complications. Care pathways for people with a new SCI are developed through consultation with the person, their families, carers and practitioners, enabling them to participate in designing their care. The development of trauma management systems has played a major role in providing the best resuscitation of the patient. In many areas it is a care standard for the injured person to be referred to a specialist spinal cord injury centre (SCIC) within four hours of arrival at hospital so that specialist care and advice can be sought from the outset. In many localities spinal outreach services (SOS) are now providing telephone support and advice, outreach visits for assessment and training and emotional support for patients, staff and relatives. Such services work alongside patient groups and associations such as spinal injuries associations (SIA) and other organisations which support patients, carers and practitioners. Although the condition is rare, many aspects of care are fundamental. Even so, there are highly specialist aspects of care that are unfamiliar to many practitioners and it is crucial that more is known and understood to ensure the best outcomes possible for the injured person and their family.</p>

                        <p>SCI is not confined to any particular age group. Acute admissions to SCI centres in the UK, for example, ranged from 3 to 103 years in 2007-8, with 20% of new injuries occurring between 21 to 30 years of age (Barr 2009). Non-traumatic causes of injury such as infection, tumour and ischaemia account for approximately 28% of cases. Falls also account for an increasing proportion of traumatic SCI and the percentage of older people with SCI has been rising (BASCIS 2006). Children and older people sustaining SCI are more susceptible to the effects of severe polytrauma than other age groups (Harrison, 2007). This chapter will focus on traumatic causes of SCI, but the principles of and rationale for care will be applicable in all cases even if initial management of the injury may be different.</p>
                        <p>Traumatic SCI may be the result of both high and low velocity impacts and mechanisms of injury vary. These include; forced flexion of the spine, sudden vehicle deceleration, flexion rotation (e.g. fall off a motorcycle at speed or ‘rolling’ a vehicle), compression (diving or fall from a horse) and hyperextension (hitting the head or chin). Injury is often associated with unexpected sudden deceleration, impact or collision with or without associated loss of consciousness (LOC), localised pain or deformity of the spinal column or loss of sensation and or movement in upper and lower limbs. The speed of impact and the height of a fall are not indicators for severity of spinal cord injury; in fact, most falls resulting in SCI tend to be from a low height (from 1 metre or less). It is important to maintain a high index of suspicion of SCI after any trauma and always in the unconscious patient at the scene with initial management including early appropriate spinal column protective measures (ACS 2008).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>As discussed in Chapter 4, the spinal column comprises the bony elements from cervical vertebra (Cl-7), thoracic vertebra (Tl-12), lumbar vertebra (Ll-5) and sacral vertebra (S1-5, fused in adults) and the coccyx (four fused). This surrounds the vertebral canal which, in turn, surrounds the spinal cord. Ligaments surround all the bony surfaces; the key ones being the anterior longitudinal ligament, the posterior longitudinal ligament and the ligamentum flavum. This creates a corset-like effect that stabilises the whole spinal structure.</p>
                        <p>The spinal cord is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and enclosed by meninges, providing a flexible, protective system within a semi-rigid frame that allows movement of the spine while protecting the cord and spinal nerves. Most movement occurs at the craniocervical, cervico-thoracic or thoraco-lumbar junction where the most rigid part of the structure (e.g. the thoracic region) meets a movable region (e.g. the cervical or lumbar). In the cervical region, the cord is enlarged and passes through a relatively narrow vertebral canal. Numerous neurones that supply the upper limbs arise from this section of the cord. This contributes to cervical injuries being the most common; accounting for approximately 50% of injuries in the USA since 2005 (National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center 2012), and 47% in the United Kingdom in 2009 (Spinal Injuries Association, 2009) and the remainder being spread between the thoracic, thoracolumbar and lumbosacral regions.</p>
                        <p>Two thirds of the blood supply to the cord is provided by the anterior artery. The posterior arteries and radicular arteries provide the final third, with input provided at different levels in the cervical and thoracic regions. Injury to the anterior artery can result in ischaemia of the cord and has a far greater impact on a larger area of tissue (two thirds of the anterior aspect of the cord). Traumatic or non-traumatic injury that results in a space-occupying lesion such as a haematoma or foreign body can cause compression to the cord and ischaemia that result in neurological damage.</p>
                        <p>In children, the vertebral facets have a shallow angulation and the vertebral bodies, particularly cervical, are more wedge-shaped. The structure is also more cartilaginous, providing much more ligamentous laxity. This can lead to false negative X-ray results. This is known as Spinal Cord Injury Without Radiologic Abnormality (SCIWORA) and is considered in more detail in Chapter 24. Children may be wrongly sent home with little or no intervention. Younger children are less able to participate in neurological examinations and may present several days or even weeks later with evidence of delayed onset neurological changes. It is recommended to always maintain a high index of suspicion in cases where there may be relatively minor trauma.</p>
                        <p>Older people may have concurrent conditions such as osteoporosis, ankylosing spondylitis and spinal stenosis, making them more vulnerable to spinal cord compression from minor trauma such as falls from standing or a low height. Forced hyperextension is a classic example that results in stretching of the cord and compression from subsequent oedema and haematoma often presenting as Spinal Cord Injury Without Radiographic Evidence of Trauma (SCIWORET).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are several stages of injury within the cord itself (Sapru, 2002). Immediately following the primary injury (within minutes) there is disruption to cell bodies and axonal activity leading to haemorrhage and oedema in and around the site of injury, releasing inflammatory mediators. This results in a neurochemical cascade, leading to further injury and damage to the cord secondary to the primary injury (within hours). This can eventually result in a CSF-filled cyst in the centre of the cord (weeks to years) with the potential for elongating the damage caused from the initial injury that can result in neurological loss higher than that initially sustained. The resulting scar tissue in the cord prevents any growing nerve fibres from crossing and, with inhibitory substances and lack of nerve growth factors in the surrounding tissues, the adult spinal cord does not regenerate spontaneously after injury. Neuro-protection and neuro-regeneration are currently being researched but, at this time, spinal cord injury remains ‘incurable.’</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Principles of care at the site of trauma include the standards for Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) as discussed in Chapter 16. As previously discussed, SCI should always be suspected in the unconscious trauma patient. It is important to maintain spinal alignment during care and management, but life threatening injuries take priority along with extraction from areas of danger for the patient, practitioner or others. If the patient is awake, assessing sensation and movement will provide information regarding voluntary movement and sensation, pain in the neck and/or back, pins and needles, burning and electric shock sensations should be noted as part of the assessment. For the conscious patient the practitioner should check hand-grip function and breath and voice sounds to give an early indication of where the injury may be. Diaphragmatic breathing (paradoxical, ‘see-saw’ breathing) can indicate a cervical or high thoracic neurological deficit along with weakness of hand-grasp or soft low volume voice.</p>
                        <p>If a high cervical injury is suspected the team should immediately instigate respiratory support as the effort to maintain respiratory function may very quickly not be sustained. Monitoring should be commenced and maintained throughout the emergency period for signs of hypotension (spinal/neurogenic shock - if there are no obvious signs of blood/fluid loss), bradycardia, diaphragmatic breathing, priapism (semi or full erection of the penis), floppy/flaccid limbs and warm peripheries with a low BP. These are all signs of neurological compromise. Priapism is a medical emergency and seeking medical advice and action should be taken to resolve it within six hours. The patient should be transported to the emergency department/trauma centre as quickly as possible under spinal immobilisation precautions using a hard collar, spinal board and head immobilisation (BOA 2006) with the spine in neutral alignment (normal curvature of spine, lying flat). Methylprednisolone is no longer recommended in acute SCI initial management (Bonner and Smith 2013).</p>
                        <p>As soon as it is safe to do so, the patient should be turned using a five-person log roll (see Figure 16.5 Chapter 16) to examine for tenderness and deformity and to insert a spinal board, hard collar and head blocks with strapping to completely immobilise the whole spine ready for transportation. In the emergency department the spinal board should be removed as soon as possible to avoid excessive pressure on the bony prominences and pre-hospital care practitioners should inform the receiving team how long the board has been in place so that they can make an informed plan to remove the board (BOA 2006) and check the pressure areas for skin trauma.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Once the patient’s condition has been stabilised, detailed clinical assessment and investigations will assist in the diagnosis of SCI. Plain X-rays of the whole spine will identify spinal fractures. The gold standard recommendation is to use whole spine MRI when a SCI is suspected. MRI imaging may be accompanied with CT to enable the team to more clearly understand the nature of the bony and soft tissue spine injury and ascertain whether this is ‘stable’ or ‘unstable.’ This will inform the management/treatment plan.</p>
                        <p>The term ‘unstable’ refers to the ability of the spinal column to withstand further stress without further deformity or neurological damage (Greaves et al., 2009). Unstable fractures and soft tissue injury of the spine can result in further trauma to the spinal cord or damage where there was none previously. Care must be provided that prevents further insult to the cord which causes the level of neurological damage to worsen; for example, through inappropriate or poor manual handling, hypoxia or further hypotension. A medical assessment and decision about spinal stability will be based on an understanding of the cause of the injury and the forces placed on the structures and cord, the reviews of CT/X-ray and MRI and assessment of the patient. This must be documented by the medical team and the patient moved with all precautions requested to ensure no further damage to the spinal cord. If the injury has been deemed stable by the medical team, this must be documented in the notes before the patient is moved without any precautions. Senior medical practitioners may specify continued use of collars or braces or limitations on movement with or without such supports. Practitioners must ensure that this is clearly documented and fully explained as understanding the medical rationale for these decisions helps the team to be safe, clear and consistent in their management of the patient. If there are any doubts, the patient must be treated as having an unstable injury with full spinal precautions. The risks of being immobilised such as pressure ulcers must be weighed against the risks of being removed from immobilisation devices and care adapted accordingly. Hard collars should be removed routinely (during a head hold procedure, where the cervical spine is secure) and the patient’s skin palpated or visualised for signs of pressure, particularly the occiput and clavicles. Guidelines for movement and handling of the patient with an unstable spinal/spinal cord injury are discussed in Box 19.1.</p>

                            <p>It is not possible to provide research based guidelines for all aspects of musculoskeletal care. One example of this is the manual handling of patients following spinal injury. In such instances expert practitioners often work together to provide guidelines that are based on expert clinical opinion. Although, as discussed in Chapter 2, expert opinion is not a higher level form of evidence, it is nevertheless an important way of ensuring that care is effective and based on the best possible practice. The Multidisciplinary Association of Spinal Cord Injury Professionals (MASCIP) is an example of a national organisation (UK) that endeavours to provide evidence-based guidelines representing current research and the consensus opinion of the best care of the patient with SCI. Guidelines are based on clinical and service user expertise and are created by inviting key representatives of specialist and national organisations and interest groups to form a working group. Core themes for the production of MASCIP guidelines are originated within the Annual MASCIP Scientific Meetings.</p>
                            <p>Existing guidelines at http://www.mascip.co.uk/guidelines.aspx include:</p>

                        <p>Conservative or surgical management of the spinal column injury will vary depending on medical opinion and protocol in the unit in which care is being provided as there is currently no consensus as to whether surgical treatment or conservative management is ultimately better for patient outcomes. Conservative options involve the use of an orthosis, halo brace, plaster jacket or bed rest with or without traction. The availability of staff who can provide expert care such as in a dedicated spinal cord injury centre can be central in this decision as the complications of both the spinal cord injury and the immobilisation of conservative management make care complex. Cervical traction is often chosen as the immediate method of reduction and stabilisation of dislocated vertebrae. As the injured spinal cord is very vulnerable to distraction it is essential that the traction device is monitored closely during any intervention and neurological observations are carried out on a regular basis reporting any loss/change of neurology (BOA, 2006) (see below for neurological assessment).</p>
