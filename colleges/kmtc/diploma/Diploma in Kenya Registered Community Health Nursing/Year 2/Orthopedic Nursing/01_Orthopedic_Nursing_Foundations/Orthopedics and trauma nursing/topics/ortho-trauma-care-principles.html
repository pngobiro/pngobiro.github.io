                        <p>Trauma is a major cause of death and disability worldwide and is the primary cause of mortality in the first four decades of life (Henning et al., 2011). Those who survive physical trauma are often left with significant long-term or permanent life changing disabilities resulting particularly from head, spine and limb threatening injuries. Several reports suggest that management of the patient sustaining trauma is often sub-optimal (NCEPOD 2007). This chapter will discuss the priorities of care in the assessment, management and treatment of individuals suffering musculoskeletal trauma whilst considering the impact of injury to other tissue besides bone on care needs. In emergency and initial care of the patient following trauma the practitioner works as part of a multidisciplinary team with the aim of preserving life and preventing death and then with the aim of preventing complications and facilitating recovery and prevention of disability.</p>

                        <p>Pre-hospital management of the patient sustaining trauma has a major impact on overall outcome and care. Management at the scene and during transfer to hospital consists of (Soloman et al., 2005):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>maintenance of airway</li>
                            <li>protection of the spine</li>
                            <li>ensuring and supporting ventilation and perfusion</li>
                            <li>controlling bleeding</li>

                        <h3>Mechanism of injury</h3>
                        <p>Traumatic injury results from the transfer of energy from the environment to human tissue. It can be subdivided into blunt and penetrating trauma. Penetrating trauma involves tissue directly affected by an object which enters tissue, while blunt trauma may affect other tissue further away from the site of impact during energy transfer. Assessment of the patient following blunt trauma can be more difficult as the extent of the injury may not be externally obvious at first. Understanding the potential effects of the mechanism of injury is useful in patient triage as well as in predicting morbidity and mortality (Haider et al., 2009) although there is some uncertainty about validity (Boyle et al., 2008). The mechanism of injury can have a predictive value for diagnosing a subsequent injury. For example, the classic presentation of a patient who fell from a height and sustained bilateral calcaneal fractures should also instigate investigation for vertebral injury as this type of mechanism often involves a transfer of energy/trauma to the spine. Although the mechanism of injury can raise suspicion as to the presence of certain injuries, Richards (2005) warns that the presence of other injuries cannot predict presence of spinal injury or vice versa and that each patient requires an individual full examination as soon as possible after the injuring event.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Primary survey</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>On arrival at the emergency department (ED) trauma patients are assessed and treated based on the ATLS (Advanced Trauma Life Support) Protocol (American College of Surgeons 2004). This offers a globally standardised approach to trauma resuscitation that is understood by the whole team and enables a focus on the life threatening aspects of injury as a priority rather than the injury which is most obvious. This means that musculoskeletal injury may not be an early priority. The primary survey is performed by the emergency/trauma care team simultaneously with resuscitation and consists of the following (mnemonic: A B C D E):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Airway (with spinal precautions)</li>
                            <li>Breathing</li>
                            <li>Circulation</li>
                            <li>Disability</li>
                            <li>Exposure/Environment Control</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The primary survey should be repeated whenever there is a change in the patients’ status. It is followed by a more definitive secondary survey where a head-to-toe examination is performed to identify all injuries and formulate a plan of care.</p>
                        <h3>Airway with spinal precautions</h3>
                        <p>Airway management is one of the core priorities in caring for trauma patients. It has been suggested that loss of a patent airway is second only to complete cardiopulmonary arrest as the most significant cause of death following trauma (WHO 2004). The airway is the gateway to the chain of oxygen delivery (Figure 16.1) without which all other links in the chain will fail, leading to organ dysfunction and death.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_15_e59ad744ad7bac926a7cg-220-1.jpg" alt="A flowchart illustrating the chain of oxygen delivery: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Tissue Perfusion, Cellular Respiration." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Assessment of the airway involves observing for causes of obstruction such as foreign bodies, tongue, teeth, oedema, blood and other secretions. Obstructions should be cautiously removed and excess secretions controlled by suctioning. A ‘blind sweep’ should never be performed to remove a foreign body as it may push the obstruction further down the pharynx. The simplest method of assessing a patient’s airway is to ask them “Are you OK?”. A logical response in a normal voice indicates the patient not only has a patent airway, but also that the brain is adequately perfused with oxygen. In the unconscious patient the airway can be maintained by insertion of an oropharyngeal airway (Figure 16.2).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_15_e59ad744ad7bac926a7cg-221-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the correct sizing and insertion technique for a Guedal oropharyngeal airway." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>An intact gag reflex indicates that the patient can maintain their own airway and the insertion of an airway device could lead to vomiting, cervical movement or raised intracranial pressure and must be avoided. Potential threats to the airway should also be assessed such as the presence of fractures, soft tissue injuries and burns. The victim of trauma is at risk for spinal injury and spinal immobilisation is maintained by placing the patient on a spinal board with immobilisation of the cervical region with sandbags or a ‘head hugger’ until any potential spinal injury can be ruled out. The head tilt/chin lift and jaw thrust positions are the standard manoeuvres for maintaining a patent airway (Figure 16.3).</p>

                        <h3>Breathing</h3>
                        <p>The patient should be assessed for the presence of injuries that may impede breathing. These include those that would affect the muscular act of breathing such as injuries to the lungs, chest wall and diaphragm along with those impeding the neurological response such as brain and spinal nerve injuries. Significant potential chest injuries in the trauma patient include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Tension pneumothorax</strong> occurs when a pleural tear allows air into the pleural cavity during inspiration but prevents it from exiting on expiration. Emergency treatment involves the insertion of a large bore cannula into the pleural cavity to allow the air to escape, followed by a chest drain.</li>
                            <li><strong>Open pneumothorax</strong> occurs when there is a significant wound to the chest wall which allows air to move freely into the pleural cavity. Treatment involves insertion of a chest drain.</li>
                            <li><strong>Haemothorax</strong> occurs when a laceration leads to accumulation of blood in the pleural cavity, leading to compression of the lung and impaired breathing. Treatment involves draining the pleural cavity of blood, although this is done cautiously in the case of a massive haemothorax as rapid blood loss may lead to circulatory collapse.</li>
                            <li><strong>Flail chest</strong> this occurs when more than one rib is fractured at multiple sites and seriously affects breathing. Emergency treatment involves intubation and ventilation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cardiac tamponade:</strong> a wound which penetrates the heart results in bleeding into the pericardial sac. This reduces the volume of blood entering the ventricles prior to systole which reduces cardiac output and affects the delivery of oxygen and perfusion of tissues and vital organs. Emergency treatment consists of removing the blood from the pericardial sac by pericardiocentesis or thoracotomy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Nursing/clinical assessment involves a full set of vital signs, paying particular attention to respiration. Observing the thoracic region for bruising and lacerations can help identify the presence of soft tissue injury. Supplemental oxygen should be considered. In all trauma patients the goal is to achieve an inspired oxygen concentration of 100% (Gwinnutt and Driscoll, 2003). Treatment of trauma patients with significant chest injuries often involves the insertion of a chest drain. Hence practitioners should be competent in the care of the patient with a chest drain.</p>

                        <h3>Circulation</h3>
                        <p>Hypotension occurs as a result of haemorrhage in the trauma victim and should be assumed until proven otherwise (Duncan and Moran 2009). Control of bleeding is the first priority by application of direct pressure where possible at the site of bleeding using pressure bandages/dressings or by application of a tourniquet in the case of uncontrolled arterial bleeding (Roissant et al., 2010). Perfusion of vital organs and tissues with oxygenated blood is dependent on blood volume and rapid replacement of lost volume is crucial in preventing a break in the chain of oxygen delivery (Figure 16.1). In addition to blood seepage from wounds and other injuries, loss of extracellular fluid from wounds involving a large surface area of the body (e.g. degloving injuries and large abrasions) should be considered when estimating volume loss. Assessment must involve observing the patient’s colour, temperature, capillary refill and degree of diaphoresis (sweating). The rate and quality of the pulse should be determined manually. IV access should be obtained, chosen fluids administered and wounds dressed to control bleeding.</p>

                        <h3>Disability</h3>
                        <p>The AVPU score (Box 16.1) can be used to perform a brief assessment of an individual’s level of consciousness. Additional use of the more detailed Glasgow coma scale (Box 16.4) can give a clearer picture of the patient’s neurological status. Blood glucose should always be checked in the unconscious patient as hypoglycaemia may be responsible for the loss of consciousness as aerobic metabolism in the neurological system is reliant on sufficient levels of glucose in addition to oxygen (Figure 16.1)</p>

                        </aside>

                        <h3>Exposure/environment control</h3>
                        <p>In order to make a comprehensive assessment it is imperative that all clothing be removed from trauma patients whilst making every effort to maintain dignity and privacy. Wet clothing can have the added effect of reducing body temperature. Clothing is often removed with the use of scissors to ensure minimal movement of patients with suspected spinal injury. If alert, the patient’s permission should be sought and the practitioner must be mindful of preserving the individual’s dignity and the rapid loss of body heat related to exposure. To prevent sudden hypotension some garments may be left on the patient with gross hypovolaemia until adequate fluid resuscitation is ensured (Gwinnutt and Driscoll 2003) as clothing can provide pressure.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Uncontrolled post-traumatic bleeding is one of the leading causes of potentially preventable death in trauma patients; so much so that the ABC approach to trauma may be changed to CABC to take account of catastrophic haemorrhage control as the initial priority (Henning 2011). Significant blood loss is affected by both direct injury and trauma related coagulopathy. Early identification of the bleeding source with timely efforts to minimise bleeding, restore tissue perfusion and haemodynamic stability are key in the management of patients with massive bleeding (Rossaint et al., 2010). The coagulation process in haemorrhaging patients is adversely affected by exhaustion of the coagulation system, dilution from fluid resuscitation and physical factors such as acidosis and hypothermia that further compromise coagulation function (Spahn and Ganter 2010). This change in coagulopathy in conjunction with hypothermia and acidosis are interlinked and have been termed the ‘lethal triad’ (Figure 16.4). The haemorrhaging patient is at an acute risk for development of hypovolaemic shock. For more information on the physiology and management of shock consult Chapter 9.</p>

                            <p>An evidence-based approach must be adopted in the assessment and management of acute traumatic wounds. The objectives are to attain a functional closure, decrease risk for infection and minimise scar formation. Although every wound must be assessed and managed individually, Nicks et al.’s (2010) systematic review of the evidence gives the following general recommendations:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Assessment of the wound including location, length, width, depth, tissue type, neurovascular and functional status, of surrounding structures, presence of debris and contaminants and range of motion.</li>
                                <li>Patient assessment including history of injury, infection/contamination risk, medication history and allergies, tetanus cover and comorbidities that may affect wound healing.</li>
                                <li>Assessment and management of wound pain through topical, local or regional anaesthesia.</li>
                                <li>Decontamination of the wound including brushing off any dry chemicals prior to irrigation.</li>
                                <li>Cleansing of the wound through application of a compress, irrigation or soaking as appropriate.</li>
                                <li>All wound surfaces should be irrigated, paying particular attention to flaps and wound edges.</li>
                                <li>Avoid unnecessary and excessive irrigation of clean wounds in highly vascularised areas.</li>
                                <li>Wounds appearing dry, gangrenous and/or ischaemic are non-healable due to ischemia.</li>
                                <li>Debridement may be necessary to remove devitalised tissue.</li>
                                <li>In the absence of intrinsic, extrinsic or mechanical damage acute wounds may be debrided and closed immediately.</li>
                                <li>Heavily contaminated wounds may need delayed primary closure to decrease infection risk.</li>
                                <li>Wounds that are left to heal by secondary intention need follow-up assessment and possible secondary debridement.</li>
                                <li>Dependent on wound severity, all patients with an unknown vaccination history or who have received fewer than three doses should receive a tetanus diphtheria vaccine (Td).</li>
                                <li>Inadequately vaccinated patients (excluding those with a clean, minor wound) should also receive tetanus immune globulin (TIG).</li>
                                <li>Patients who have received three or more tetanus vaccines prior to the injury only need Td vaccination if their previous dose was: >10 years ago for clean, minor wounds or >5 years ago for other wounds.</li>
                                <li>The need for antibiotic therapy is determined by wound type and method of closure, patient characteristics and infection risk.</li>
                                <li>The most predictive factors for wound infection are wound location, wound age, depth, configuration, contamination and patient age.</li>
                                <li>Antibiotic therapy should be considered for patients at heightened risk such as those with prosthetic joints, on corticosteroids, at risk of endocarditis or those that are immunocompromised.</li>
                                <li>A dressing that provides a warm moist healing environment is recommended.</li>

                        <p>Spinal precautions is a term used to describe strict immobilisation of the spine. Wherever a spinal injury is diagnosed or suspected the whole spine should be immobilised. Spinal immobilisation signifies the maintenance of spinal alignment, which should take into account the normal alignment of the individual’s spine and pre-existing conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis. Cervical immobilisation can be attained by application of a cervical collar and a ‘head-hugger’ or sandbags. A recent Cochrane review (Kwan et al., 2009) raised concern that cervical spine immobilisation may be associated with a higher morbidity and mortality than non-immobilisation and highlighted the paucity of evidence on the effectiveness of spinal immobilisation strategies. Although further robust evidence is required on the efficacy of cervical collars, current recommendations are summarised in Box 16.3.</p>

                            <p>The practice of adopting spinal precautions in a patient following neck trauma has been widely adopted through fear of exacerbating or inadvertently causing a spinal injury. This guideline reviews the evidence for the management of patients with a suspected or actual spinal injury. Recommendations on neck immobilisation are as follows (for further recommendations on decision making, timing and type of imaging required see full guideline):</p>

                                <li>Patients at risk of cervical spine injuries should have their neck immobilised.</li>
                                <li>The use of a collar to immobilise the neck is not compulsory in patients with pre-existing spinal anatomical abnormalities, as it may force the neck into an unnatural position with detrimental consequences.</li>
                                <li>Cervical spine immobilisation should be continued until a full clinical and risk assessment is performed which indicates that the collar can be safely removed.</li>
                                <li>Cervical collars should only be removed by staff who have undergone training in the use of a validated cervical spine clinical decision rule.</li>
                                <li>Nurses can safely apply clinical decision making rules for cervical spine clearance following specific training, although further study and more rigorous evidence is recommended in this area.</li>

                        <p>Cervical collars are designed to restrict neck flexion, extension, lateral tilt and rotation, and do not restrict axial loading. In choosing a collar for a patient it is important to follow manufacturers’ instructions regarding sizing to ensure a proper fit. The patient’s chin should rest centrally on the chin rest and not slide down inside or protrude out over the chin rest. The collar is designed to fit snugly and not constrict the patient’s ability to breathe, cough, swallow or vomit (Webber-Jones et al., 2002). Once the collar is fitted the patient should be regularly assessed to ensure the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The collar fits the patient correctly.</li>
                            <li>Assess neurological status before and after any interventions involving changing the collar.</li>
                            <li>Skin care is performed at least daily. When the collar is removed to perform skin care manual in-line stabilisation of the patient’s head and neck should be ensured by adopting the correct head hold. One part of the collar is removed at a time and the back of the patient’s head can be inspected during the log roll. Always follow the immobilisation directions documented in the patient’s chart.</li>
                            <li>The skin is assessed for evidence of breakdown particularly the occiput, chin, ears, mandible ridge, shoulders, sternum and laryngeal prominence.</li>
                            <li>The collar itself should be cleaned daily and inside padding changed/cleaned as per manufacturers’ instructions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Thoracic and lumbar spine immobilisation can be achieved by placing the patient on a spinal board for transfer and on a firm mattress surface. Access to the patient’s posterior surface can be achieved by performing a log roll. A log roll is a manual handling procedure whereby a patient is rolled from lying on one aspect of the body to lying on another, whilst maintaining correct vertebral alignment. It may be required for inserting or removing a spinal board, examination, providing specific nursing care or for the purpose of relieving pressure (Harrison 2000). A guide to performing a safe log roll is provided in Figure 16.5.</p>

                        <p>Neurological assessment should take into account any motor or sensory deficits that may indicate a spinal cord injury. On arrival to the Emergency Department patients are assessed for their risk of spinal injury. Decision making tools such as the NEXUS score (Hoffman et al., 2000) and Canadian c-spine rule (Stiell et al., 2001) can assist in determining which patients can be cleared from suspected cervical spine injury without imaging. These scores apply to conscious patients and a difficulty arises when attempts are made to clear the spine of an unconscious patient. Richards (2005) suggests that decision making tools with the aid of imaging technology also have a place in diagnosing spinal clearance of unconscious patients and recommends extending the CT of the brain to include the cervical spine in at-risk unconscious trauma patients.</p>

Open limb fractures should be managed prior to attending to closed fractures as there is an increased risk of chronic infection if treatment is delayed.

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Once the primary and secondary surveys have taken place there is a need to plan the definitive care of any skeletal injuries. The existence of more than one injury (be it skeletal, soft tissue or organ) indicates, however, that not only has the patient sustained significant high energy trauma, but that there is a greater likelihood of an extreme physiological response to tissue damage which can result in severe life-threatening complications such as extreme inflammatory responses, metabolic dysfunction, severe immunosuppressive responses and coagulopathy (clotting disorders) which can lead to multiorgan failure and potential death (Keel and Trentz 2005). It is essential, therefore, that all injuries are identified at the time of the secondary survey so that their existence can be included as part of the overall management plan. The severity of these injuries is sometimes assessed using a trauma scoring system designed to help practitioners to identify care and management priorities and to ascertain risks to life. Such scoring systems can be useful when there is an isolated injury, but tend to be less accurate where more than one injury is involved. They categorise injuries of the respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous systems and abdomen, extremities and skin as minor to critical and take into account any existing complications. Their main purpose is to provide an alert for the need for prompt assessment and treatment as well as a way of prioritising injuries (Pape et al., 2010).</p>
                        <p>Multiple trauma (often termed polytrauma) can include, in addition to skeletal injury, injuries to the head, face, neck, spine, chest, trunk and abdomen and their underlying organs and structures including major blood vessels and nerves along with severe traumatic skin wounds. The physiological assault of a complex pattern of injury often requires care in an intensive/ critical care unit where the patient’s condition can be carefully monitored from a respiratory and cardiovascular perspective and mechanical ventilation and other therapies can be provided.</p>
                        <p>Injuries to the pelvis, head and spine are those injuries which are the most likely to lead to death. Hence these are often the focus of emergency care and in the period immediately after resuscitation and stabilisation and following admission. Where there are several injuries and where there is no reason to suspect vascular damage (with potential for severe bleeding) the principles of ‘damage control orthopaedics’ are usually employed.</p>
                        <p>This acknowledges a need to focus on stabilising those injuries most likely to threaten life before undertaking definitive final orthopaedic surgery to stabilise limb fractures, for example. This often, initially, involves temporary splintage or external fixation of long bone fractures of the limbs and conservative management of major wounds until such time as other injuries are stabilised and the patient is physiologically able to cope with major orthopaedic surgery (McRae and Esser 2008). This provides specific challenges for the care of the patient in both the critical care and ward settings.</p>

                        <h3>Pelvic fractures</h3>
                        <p>The pelvis is a large bowl-shaped ring made up of several bony components and strong ligaments which provides protection for the pelvic organs and transfers weight from the upper to lower body. As such it is an extremely stable structure, requiring significant trauma to disrupt it. Most commonly the pelvic ring suffers major injury through the crushing of the lower abdomen. Examples of mechanisms of injury include a motor vehicle or industrial accident or disasters such as earthquakes and blasts where parts of buildings trap victims. A significant amount of force is needed to disrupt the pelvic ring and this can result in two significant effects:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>That the mechanism of injury involved significant force. This warns the clinical team that any resultant injury to the area is likely to be severe</li>
                            <li>That there is potential for severe damage to structures contained within the pelvis such as major blood vessels and nerves, the bladder, urethra, bowel and genitalia.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Because the pelvis forms a ring, it is often the case that crushing it involves ‘breaking’ it in two places (either by bony fracture or disruption to ligaments and joints) and may also involve severe disruption of the ligaments that contribute to pelvic stability at the symphisis pubis and sacroiliac joints. This can result in an unstable injury in which two parts of the pelvis become capable of moving separately, potentially resulting in further severe damage to the structures within the pelvis. Bleeding from damaged major blood vessels within or around the pelvis is a major cause of death in the trauma patient and requires careful fluid replacement and haemodynamic stabilisation. This bleeding may not always be obvious at first as the retroperitoneum has the capacity to hold up to four litres in the adult. Therefore careful assessment and monitoring of vital signs is paramount in diagnosing haemorrhage. The individual’s normal blood pressure and previous diagnosis of hypertension should be considered in this assessment. Severely displaced fractures of the pelvis can be stabilised using pelvic binding or temporary external fixation while the patient is stabilised physiologically (Chapter 8). Signs of injury to the bladder and urethra must be carefully observed including assessment of urinary output and any signs of blood at the urethral meatus. Any suspicion of urethral trauma suggests urethral catheterisation is contraindicated and a supra-pubic catheter should be inserted. Injury to the bowel is also a concern and observation should include an assessment for the presence of any lower abdominal pain, distension and absence of bowel sounds.</p>
                        <p>Minimally displaced stable fractures of the pelvic ring can often be treated conservatively. These can be very painful and the patient requires careful support and pain management while healing and remobilisation commence gradually.</p>

                        <h3>Head injury</h3>
                        <p>Skeletal trauma is often associated with head injury - a major cause of death and long-term disability following traumatic injury - which may be associated with other skeletal and soft tissue injuries. Head injury is defined as (SIGN 2009, p. 2):</p>
                        <blockquote>(a history of a blow to the head or the presence of a scalp wound or those with evidence of altered consciousness after relevant injury.)</blockquote>
                        <p>The level of consciousness according to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (Box 16.6) is usually used to categorise the severity of a head injury as follows (SIGN 2009):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>mild 13-15</li>
                            <li>moderate 9-12</li>

Fractures of the skull can include both closed and compound fractures and are usually linear or depressed. Depressed fractures are most likely to cause associated brain injury due to damage caused by the bone being pushed in towards the brain.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of different types of brain injury with potential intracranial complications that might lead to death or disability:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>contusion or bruising of brain tissue</li>
                            <li>cerebral laceration</li>
                            <li>focal injuries localised to specific areas</li>
                            <li>intracerebral haemorrhage</li>
                            <li>vascular damage including: extradural haematoma, subdural haematoma.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Minor head injury (e.g. GCS >13) requires careful observation using the GCS and identification of any deteriorating parameters. Apparent minor head injury can lead to significant cerebral damage and physical effects and it is therefore essential that the practitioner recognises any need for immediate medical attention. Frequent neurological observation using the GCS are essential in all patients who meet the definition of head injury defined above until the patient is deemed stable neurologically. It is essential that the GCS is recorded clearly and it is recommended that the three individual components of the scale (eye-opening, verbal response and motor responses) are described separately in all verbal and written communications and records so that the information always accompanies the total score. NICE (2007b) also recommend that in all head injured patients it is essential that pain is managed effectively (especially if there are other skeletal injuries) as unmanaged pain can lead to a rise in intracranial pressure and increased risk of haemorrhage.</p>
                        <p>Detecting early neurological deterioration can expedite neurosurgical interventions that can prevent permanent disability or death from the deteriorating brain injury. Although the majority of head injuries are minor, they can be associated with other skeletal injuries or other trauma and the mechanism of injury may mean that in some hospitalised trauma patients severe head injury is more likely. It may also be masked by a focus on other more obvious injuries in the early stages of management of the multiply injured patient.</p>
                        <p>The following are indications of significant brain injury (NICE 2007b) and should instigate medical referral and urgent CT scan of the brain:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>GCS <13 when first assessed in the ED</li>
                            <li>GCS <15 when assessed in ED two hours after injury</li>
                            <li>suspected open or depressed skull fracture</li>
                            <li>sign of fracture at skull base (blood in the ear, ‘panda’ eyes/periorbital ecchymosis, cerebrospinal fluid leakage from ears or nose, Battle’s sign/bruising over the mastoid process)</li>
                            <li>post-traumatic seizure</li>
                            <li>focal neurological deficit</li>
                            <li>more than one episode of vomiting</li>
                            <li>increased amnesia of events more than 30 minutes before trauma.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition it is recommended that a neurosurgeon is involved if the patient is on a non-neurosurgical unit if any of the following occur:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>persistent coma</li>
                            <li>unexplained confusion for more than four hours</li>
                            <li>deterioration in GCS (especially in motor response)</li>
                            <li>progressive focal neurological signs</li>
                            <li>seizure without full recovery.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is always careful frequent assessment and recording of these parameters that can detect the patient in need of intervention and the practitioner is central to this.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Major wounds, crush Injuries and traumatic amputations</h3>
                        <p>Injury can be associated with major wounds due to both blunt and sharp trauma. Mechanisms of injury that involve the ‘crushing’ of a part of the body between two hard surfaces occur most commonly in motor vehicle and industrial accidents as well as in incidents where blasts, collapsed buildings or multiple passenger transport systems are involved. Underlying tissues are compressed and surrounding tissue and organs may be severely damaged. An underlying fracture associated with significant tissue damage presents a major challenge to the trauma team for four main reasons:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A high possibility of severe infection, not only of damaged soft tissue, but of underlying skeletal tissue (see Chapter 17 for further discussion the management of compound fractures).</li>
                            <li>Damage to the blood vessels supplying tissue leading to ischaemia and necrosis of tissue and a risk of anaerobic infection.</li>
                            <li>Such severe damage to neurovascular structures that the limb (or part of a limb) has no viable circulation and damage is so severe that amputation is the only possible course of action. In some incidents the limb or part of limb may have been traumatically amputated at the time of the injury. In this instance it is important to consider the care of the severed body part when attending to wound care, taking into account X-rays, ischaemic time and asepsis.</li>
                            <li>The physiological impact of a large amount of tissue damage may result in a patient who is critically ill as discussed above.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Patients with significant wounds may require resuscitation and need careful monitoring for signs of vascular instability and sepsis along with judicious intravenous hydration and pain management. Significant wounds require meticulous asepsis and their management needs to be considered using a team approach which involves orthopaedic trauma surgery as well as plastic surgery teams. The decision to amputate or salvage an injured limb is based on multiple factors such as location of injured part, age and pre-existing conditions, type of injury, ischaemic time and presence of infection, and generally a consensus from two experts is required prior to amputation. Scoring systems can be helpful in making the decision between primary amputation and limb salvage (Shanmuganthan 2008). Long-term care focuses on rehabilitation (Chapter 6) and wound care (Chapter 12) paying particular attention to debridement of devitalised tissue, shaping of the stump, psychological care, pain assessment and relief of phantom sensations, and promoting optimal function and mobility.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Rhabdomyolysis</h3>
                        <p>Skeletal injury, particularly where significant soft tissue and muscle is involved, can release the contents of muscle cells into the circulation releasing the muscle protein myoglobin into the blood stream. This can result in a relatively uncommon but serious condition known as ‘crush syndrome’ or rhabdomyolysis. Because of the size and toxicity of the myoglobulin, it can affect the glomerular filtration rate of the kidney and result in acute renal failure. The patient becomes seriously ill. Although rhabdomyolysis may be largely without symptoms, the practitioner should assess renal function by observing the volume of urine output as well as for red or ‘cola’ coloured urine, the patient may also complain of generalised muscle pain and weakness. Any concerns should be immediately reported to medical staff. Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting the level of muscle enzymes in the blood and treatment centres on flushing the myoglobulin out of the system through dialysis. Rhabdomyolysis can often coincide with compartment syndrome (Chapter 9) and a high suspicion of its development should be maintained when caring for patients following crush injuries.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Monitoring, deterioration and early warning scores</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Patients with severe or multiple injury can be physiologically unstable for several days or weeks following admission and even following transfer from the intensive care setting to a general hospital trauma ward. It is essential, therefore, that the patient’s physiological status is carefully monitored until complete stability is assured. Even some weeks after the injury and subsequent surgery patients remain at risk of significant complications (see Chapter 9 for further discussion of these).</p>
                        <p>A common and widely recommended approach to monitoring patients following injury is the use of an early warning score with the aim of detecting clinical deterioration in the patient as early as possible so that active measures can be taken to prevent further deterioration and intensive care unit admission. This recognises the link between physiological observations and adverse clinical outcomes. A variety of different early warning score methods are in use internationally depending on local policy, but the principles remain the same. Early warning scores involve calculating a score derived from regular observations of the following parameters:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>mental response</li>
                            <li>pulse rate</li>
                            <li>BP</li>
                            <li>respiratory rate</li>
                            <li>temperature and</li>
                            <li>urinary output.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Of these respiratory rate is considered to be the most important in identifying a change in the patient’s condition and some systems do not include urinary output although there are numerous reasons why this should be included in standard monitoring practice. Careful and frequent (as often as every 30 minutes if the practitioner has reason to suspect the patient may be at risk of deterioration) recordings are made on a specialised chart which enables the practitioner to identify any changes immediately. The score will often have a threshold of deterioration in the physiological parameters at which the practitioner needs to take action. This action initially involves seeking immediate medical attention, referral to a senior medical practitioner if necessary and possible referral to the intensive/critical care team. Many hospitals now provide an intensive care outreach service or similar where ward staff can seek the support of an critical care practitioner in monitoring the patient, making decisions and identifying action needed. Research is increasingly indicating that early warning scores are an effective way to recognise the deteriorating patient in need of intervention with potential to decrease the number of patients who require emergency resuscitation and some are now being developed for specific populations such as children.</p>
