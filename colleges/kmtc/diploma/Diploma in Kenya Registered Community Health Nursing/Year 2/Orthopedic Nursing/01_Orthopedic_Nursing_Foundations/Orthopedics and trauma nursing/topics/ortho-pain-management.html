                        <p>Pain is the most frequently reported initial symptom in up to 91% of all trauma patients and is the commonest reason for self-referral to accident and emergency or community health services (Berben et al., 2008), but the high variability in pain experiences between individuals means that the extent of and reaction to pain is unpredictable. The individual and unique nature of this experience makes it essential for all patients to be rigorously assessed prior to initiating appropriate pain management treatments/techniques. To ensure optimal standards of patient care, this requires practitioners working with patients in pain to be fully informed of the evidence base for best practice in this area.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Pain is frequently reported as having an elusive quality which is difficult to quantify and is highly variable between individuals. This has led to great difficulty in establishing explanations for pain as an emotion or a physical sensation.</p>
                        <h3>The Gate Control theory of pain</h3>
                        <p>In 1946, based on experiences in the Second World War, Dr H Beecher published a seminal paper which ignited debate on the nature of pain as a purely physical phenomenon and argued that the meaning of pain to the individual experiencing it was a key component (Beecher 1959). The first scientific evidence to support this was published by Melzack and Wall (1965) in their outline of what continues to be known as the Gate Control Theory of pain (Figure 11.1). This has undergone a number of subsequent modifications, but the overall premise of the theory is generally accepted and provides a workable explanation for this complex phenomenon that marries both mechanistic physiological explanations with myriad individual variables. It can be broken down into four key segments: peripheral sensitisation, spinal modulation, central modulation and conscious recognition. Together these are called nociception (Parsons and Preece 2010).</p>

                        <h4>Peripheral sensitisation</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>At the point of trauma/injury the body’s initial response is to initiate a chemical reaction which is known as an “inflammatory response.”</li>
                            <li>Once this reaches a critical threshold it activates a chain of nerve impulse reactions that propel the message towards the central body systems.</li>
                            <li>Two key types of nerve fibres are specifically responsible for the transmission of pain messages - A-delta fibres and C fibres.</li>
                            <li>A-delta fibres transmit ‘fast’ messages commonly associated with acute, sharp stabbing pain and reflex responses and are present in large quantities in the somatic areas of the body.</li>
                            <li>C fibres transmit ‘slow’ messages and are present in both the somatic areas of the body, but also in the viscera and are commonly associated with slower throbbing pain sensation and chronic pain conditions.</li>
                            <li>A third peripheral nerve fibre A-beta is not involved in transmission of pain but does play a role in moderating the pain experience.</li>
                            <li>A-delta and C fibres are commonly referred to as nociceptors that transmit noxious messages.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Spinal modulation</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Once messages from the peripheral nerves reach the spinal column they enter an area of the dorsal horn, known as the substantia gelatinosa.</li>
                            <li>Impulses cross over in the spinal tract and are sent upwards to the hypothalamus in the brain.</li>
                            <li>Impulses may be modified upon entry into the substantia gelatinosa and this can impact on the amount of pain experienced.</li>
                            <li>Modification at this stage was initially hypothesised as a ‘gate’ similar to a garden gate which, when open, allows unimpeded entry for nerve impulses to transmit message upwards through the spinal tract. If closed, however, the gate prevents the onwards transmission and results in a lack of conscious awareness of pain.</li>
                            <li>Melzack and Wall (1965) hypothesised that the gate could be closed by activating A-beta fibres to transmit non-noxious messages which would result in a bottleneck through the gate that would prevent messages from the A-delta and C fibres getting through e.g. rubbing your knee after banging it.</li>
                            <li>They further hypothesised that the gate could also be closed by descending messages from the central nervous system e.g. reassurance, attribution and production of chemical modulators such as endogenous opioids.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Central modulation</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Once nerve impulses reach the brain they enter the hypothalamus where C fibre impulses terminate.</li>
                            <li>Impulses from A-delta fibres continue to be relayed to the higher centres of the brain and enter all areas of the brain matrix.</li>
                            <li>Consciousness of pain is only gained once impulses have reached the brain and any intervention that prevents the onward and upward transmission of pain will ensure lack of awareness e.g. spinal and epidural analgesia.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Conscious recognition</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Only once an individual has become conscious of a painful sensation can recognition occur.</li>
                            <li>Recognition is crucial in modulating the pain experience, as at this stage the individual will not only identify that they have pain, but place some form of value on it which will significantly affect their interpretation and behaviour.</li>
                            <li>Acute pain (associated with trauma and orthopaedic surgery) may mean the pain is associated with a high anxiety or a highly emotional situation such as fear of death, making an individual highly vigilant about their pain, interpreting any pain sensations as severe and highly significant.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively, pain could equally be interpreted as non-threatening and this may allow an individual to minimise the experience and treat symptoms lightly.</li>
                            <li>It is hypothesised that this interpretation can lead to direct physiological modulation of pain impulses through changes to the inflammatory chemicals present in both the brain and the spinal tract (Parsons and Preece 2010).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The key learning points from the gate control theory which all healthcare workers should be aware of are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Pain is highly individual.</li>
                            <li>There is no direct link between amount of tissue damage and amount of pain experienced.</li>
                            <li>Pain is the result of a combination of physiological, emotional and psychological factors.</li>
                            <li>The conscious experience of pain can be modulated at a number of points in the process.</li>
                            <li>Many physiological processes are still unproven with many exact mechanisms unknown.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Although the gate control theory works relatively well to explain acute pain, the physiological processes underlying chronic pain are still subject to much debate.</p>

                        <p>Aside from the actual process of nociception, acute pain also provokes a series of well-evidenced physiological responses known as the ‘stress response.’ This is generally considered a means by which the body can minimise or prevent further damage and is activated by sympathetic nervous activity. Prolonged stress such as that caused by unrelieved acute pain can result in a number of harmful effects across all major body systems (Table 11.1). It is especially important to recognise the effects of undertreated acute pain in the trauma patient, as many of the symptoms can also be caused by a range of other factors which may also be affecting the patient e.g. hypovolaemia. Although action may be taken to correct one element, undertreated pain can reduce the effectiveness any interventions.</p>

                        <p>Acute pain is commonly associated with traumatic injury and orthopaedic surgery. It can be defined as pain of sudden specific onset of limited duration and is identified as having a number of key features. It is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>incident-specific</li>
                            <li>serves a function</li>
                            <li>objective clinical signs</li>
                            <li>commonly associated with trauma</li>
                            <li>of known duration</li>
                            <li>responsive to a range of analgesics</li>
                            <li>affects only the individual</li>
                            <li>limited financial implications.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Acute pain is also commonly regarded as serving as an alarm warning about impending or actual bodily damage, motivation to escape from the cause of pain and to protect an injured area (Parsons and Preece 2010).</p>
                        <p>In contrast, chronic pain is associated with chronic musculoskeletal conditions and can be defined as pain of long or indeterminate duration which may persist beyond the time of normal healing or without specific causation (Mackintosh and Elson 2008). It can be identified as being:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>not incident-specific</li>
                            <li>uncertain causal factors</li>
                            <li>unknown duration</li>
                            <li>of limited functionality</li>
                            <li>unresponsive to a range of treatments</li>
                            <li>affects a wider social group</li>
                            <li>can have severe financial implications</li>
                            <li>closely associated with depressive illness.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The clear difference between the two experiences can have a major impact on the individual pain sufferer and their family as well as affecting the central modulation of the pain experience (Mackintosh and Elson 2008). It is also important to note that acute and chronic pain do not necessarily occur in isolation from each other. Patients with chronic pain conditions can also suffer from acute pain episodes (e.g. hip fracture in a patient with osteoarthritis) and poorly treated acute pain is now a well recognised precursor of chronic pain with 50-60% of trauma patients reporting moderate to severe injury-related pain 6-12months after their trauma (Clay et al., 2010).</p>
                        <p>Pain is also commonly classified into two major types (Parsons and Preece 2010):</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Nociceptive pain</strong> - pain as a direct result of injury to somatic substances e.g. skin, bone, muscle and connective tissues and as a direct result of injury to the viscera e .g. gastrointestinal obstruction, pancreatitis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Neuropathic pain</strong> - pain as a direct result of damage to the sensory or peripheral nervous system; this can be centrally generated i.e. sympathetically maintained pains (SMP’s) or peripherally generated e.g. nerve root compression.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>These two types of pain do not occur in isolation and it is common for patients to experience both types of pain from the same trauma e.g. both somatic and nerve damage from a compound fracture.</p>
                        <p>This means the orthopaedic/trauma practitioner will encounter patients experiencing a wide range of pain symptoms and reacting to these in highly variable and unpredictable ways. This places great importance on the individual assessment of pain to ensure treatment is both appropriate and effective.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The individual and highly variable nature of pain makes pain assessment an essential element of good quality care. Without it the treatment and management of pain is likely to be ineffective. A large body of evidence continues to suggest that pain assessment is poorly and infrequently carried out. Reasons for the failure to adequately assess patients’ pain are many and varied and include: lack of knowledge of why or how to assess pain, pain assessment as a low priority, failure to believe patients’ self-reports of pain and failure of patients to report pain (Gillaspie 2010).</p>
                        <p>Knowledge of how to assess pain is fundamental. Accurate assessment can provide many indicators that aid diagnosis of both the condition and the pain and facilitate appropriate and effective treatment. Guidelines for the management of hip fractures (NICE 2011) state that the first point of assessment is to ‘assess the patients pain’ followed immediately by offering analgesia to all patients regardless of cognitive state.</p>
                        <p>Nine Key areas should be considered when taking a pain history (ANZCA 2005):</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>site of pain - where it hurts</li>
                            <li>how the pain started</li>
                            <li>what the pain feels like - its character</li>
                            <li>how much it hurts - its intensity</li>
                            <li>symptoms associated with it - nausea</li>
                            <li>effect of pain on activities and sleep</li>
                            <li>any current treatment for the pain</li>
                            <li>any past medical history</li>
                            <li>other factors influencing symptoms - beliefs, expectations, coping mechanisms.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>These can be used simply as direct questions when in conversation with a patient, but answers provide important clues to treatment and management. This is especially important if trying to differentiate between nociceptive pain and neuropathic pain. The patient’s own descriptive words are essential. Nociceptive pain from somatic damage is commonly described as: sharp, hot, vice-like, and is easily localised. Nociceptive pain (from viscera) is more likely to be described as; dull, cramping or colicky and it is more difficult for the patient to identify the exact spot which hurts. Instead it is characterised by a more generalised overall tenderness. Neuropathic pain may be described as burning, shooting and stabbing. It can happen spontaneously and can be associated with hypersensitivity of surrounding tissue (hyperalgesia).</p>
                        <h3>Formal pain assessment</h3>
                        <p>Although speaking directly to a patient to identify the nature of their pain is both common sense and best practice, because of the long history of failings in this area formalised pain assessment tools are now commonly used and there is clear evidence that they lead to improvements in patients’ pain experiences (Parsons and Preece 2010). These take a variety of forms, measure a range of pain dimensions and have been developed for use across a wide range of different patients from pre-verbal infants to those with advanced dementia. Some of these tools focus on the patient’s own self-report, whilst others use behavioural indicators to arrive at algorithmically derived measures of an individual’s pain. It is generally accepted that using the patient’s self-report of pain is best practice.</p>
                        <p>The commonest used pain assessment tools in the acute setting are self-reported uni-dimensional tools, which measure one element of the pain experience its intensity. These take three forms: Descriptive scales, numerical scales and visual analogue scales (VAS) (Box 11.1).</p>

                        </aside>
                        <p>Descriptive scales consist of a range of words which can be used to describe the intensity of pain along a continuum e.g. from no pain to unbearable pain:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Numerical scales require a patient to give their pain a rating based on a number with 1 normally being the least and 10 the highest pain intensity.</li>
                            <li>Visual Analogue Scales consist of a 10 cm long line with no pain at one end and the worst pain imaginable at the other and the patient is asked to mark or indicate on the line where their pain currently sits.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Another commonly used uni-dimensional tool is the “Wong Baker Faces” rating scale which consists of pictures of stylised faces ranging from smiling to crying, which can be used in children who are able to point to the appropriate picture.</p>
                        <p>The key advantage for these tools is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The speed with which they can be used (particularly for the patient following acute traumatic injury).</li>
                            <li>They provide a baseline against which the effect of treatments can be measured.</li>
                            <li>Their repeatability over a period of time/treatment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>They also suffer from a number of disadvantages (Parsons and Preece 2010):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Their uni-dimensional nature severely limits their scope.</li>
                            <li>Some patients have difficulty in conceptualising their pain as a number or a line on a rating scale.</li>
                            <li>Some patients prefer to use their own choice of descriptive words and find others restricting.</li>
                            <li>They commonly assume the patient has only one source of pain.</li>
                            <li>They are entirely reliant on the patients self-report.</li>
                            <li>They cannot be used with a patient who is unable to communicate.</li>
                            <li>They are not liked by some practitioners.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A useful adjunct to the uni-dimensional pain tool is the addition of body pictures, normally showing the front and back of the body. These allow either the patient or the nurse to draw exactly where the pain is, if it moves to indicate where this occurs and, where a patient has multiple sources of pain, to document each individually (Mackintosh and Elson 2008).</p>
                        <p>In order to overcome some of these disadvantages more complex multi-dimensional self-report pain assessment tools have been developed. A commonly used example of a more structured self-report scale is the McGill Pain Questionnaire (Mackintosh 2007) which assesses a range of aspects about the pain experience besides simple intensity. Its effectiveness in the acute situation is limited as it is lengthy to administer and is more commonly associated with chronic pain assessment.</p>
                        <p>In the United Kingdom chronic pain is now frequently assessed using the SF36 scale (available in the public domain from www.RAND.org) which seeks to link quality of life with pain intensity and physical functionality and has tended to replace the Brief Pain Inventory as the assessment tool of choice. Although these tools may be useful for assessing pain in the longer-term orthopaedic patient who has a complex trajectory of interventions and treatments, they are of little value in acute pain situations. They are also limited to use with patients who are able or willing to self-report. Where patients cannot self-report, a range of other tools have been developed focusing on two key groups: preverbal infants and young children and patients who are cognitively impaired or suffer from dementia. These tools focus on observational data gained from analysis of the patient’s behaviour and can include characteristics such as: facial grimacing or frowning, agitation, aggression, verbal expressions such as moaning and physiological indicators of increased heart rate and raised blood pressure. The Abbey Dementia Scale is a commonly used example and is freely available from www.dementiacareaustralia.com. The effectiveness of these tools is hard to establish as they are used on a group of patients who are unlikely to provide feedback. Where these have been used to initiate improved pain management regimes for patients with dementia in care homes, there is evidence of decreased agitation and aggression, which is assumed to be evidence of reduced pain (Cunningham 2006).</p>
                        <p>When considering pain assessment tools, important points can be summarised as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Regular pain assessment using a tool improves acute pain management.</li>
                            <li>Self-reporting of pain is best practice and should be used whenever possible.</li>
                            <li>The pain assessment tool used should be appropriate to the individual patient.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Successful pain assessment</h3>
                        <p>For pain assessment to be effective in minimising pain, it must focus beyond the use of a pain assessment tool and must be carried out frequently. It must be documented and unacceptable levels of pain must result in action to alleviate the pain. Pain should be assessed immediately upon presentation to the hospital and within 30 minutes of administering initial analgesia, followed by hourly pain assessment until settled and then assessed routinely (NICE 2011). The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) (Schugg 2011) has led a campaign since 2000 to have pain assessment included as the ‘fifth vital sign’ in conjunction with routine temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate (TPR), highlighting the importance of regular, routine pain assessment for all patients.</p>
                        <p>Parsons and Preece (2010) identify four key times when pain assessment should be carried out:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>initially to gain a base line observation</li>
                            <li>at intervals following an intervention e.g. 15-30minutes</li>
                            <li>at regular intervals after a treatment begins</li>
                            <li>following any reported change in the description, location and intensity of the pain.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Parsons and Preece (2010, p. 75) also highlight six golden rules for pain assessment:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>always assess pain</li>
                            <li>always ask the patient</li>
                            <li>all people should always use the same pain assessment tool on the same patient</li>
                            <li>always assess pain on movement or deep breathing or coughing and not just at rest</li>
                            <li>always document the patient’s pain assessment</li>
                            <li>always evaluate the intervention using the same pain assessment tool.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>All pain assessment which is reliant on the patient’s self-report assumes that the patient’s self-reports will be believed. As McCaffery (1979) is frequently quoted as saying ‘pain is what the person says it is and exists when they say it does.’ Unfortunately, a growing body of evidence suggests that, in many situations, practitioners are reluctant to believe patients and frequently use their own subjective judgements of a person’s pain in preference to the patient’s. Progress in pain assessment and management can only be made if practitioners are prepared to accept the patient’s self-report and this is fundamental to all forms of pain assessment. Evidence focused on pain assessment is explored in Boxes 11.2 and 11.3.</p>

                            <p>Gillaspie (2010) identified that patients undergoing total joint replacement surgery had a high incidence of unsatisfactory pain which made this a ‘high risk for pain’ procedure. In order to increase satisfaction with postoperative pain a ‘GEMBA’ approach was used which looked specifically at one physical setting, the orthopaedic ‘floor’ (ward/unit). Data were gathered from patients, nurses, physical therapy staff and anaesthetists. This exposed gaps in current practice with a specific focus on patient education. Pre-operative information failed to prepare patients for actual post-operative experiences. As a direct result of this a new bedside patient information tool was developed. This was evaluated in three cycles of; Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA), with additional refinements added at each stage of the cycle. Evaluation of the new tool demonstrated improved patient-staff communication, more accurate pain assessment and increased patient satisfaction with post-operative pain.</p>

                            <p>Under-treatment of pain in emergency departments has been frequently reported. This observational study (Berben et al., 2008) over three months in two emergency departments in the Netherlands describes the prevalence, intensity, location and course of pain in trauma patients. 450 patients were included in the study, with no differences between the two departments. 91% of patients reported pain on admission and 86% reported pain on discharge, with an average pain intensity of 5.9 (out of 10 maximum) on admission and 5 on discharge. Nearly half of all patients reported no change in pain on discharge. Only 49% of patients reported receiving information on pain management and 19% received pharmacological pain treatments. Pharmacological pain treatments consisted of local anaesthetics (40%) and systemic pain medications (60%).</p>
                            <p>Overall management of pain was considered a low priority with a key focus on ‘anatomical’ injury treatment. Even simple pain alleviation methods such as ice packing and elevation of body parts were infrequently observed. The researchers concluded that pain in the emergency department continues to be under-treated and requires to be addressed systematically including assessment using recognised tools and treatment with basic pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods initiated at the earliest stage.</p>

                        <p>Once pain has been assessed it can be managed in a number of ways, and it is now commonly accepted that in most instances a multi-modal or balanced approach towards pain management is likely to be the most effective (Malchow and Black 2008). A multi-modal approach involves treating the pain using a variety of approaches and methods designed to work on different components of the pain experience. A variety of models of treatment are used in practice normally focusing on: systemic analgesics, local and regional anaesthetics, adjuvant drugs and non-pharmacological management of pain. All of these approaches have some benefit to the management and treatment of acute traumatic and orthopaedic pain (Clark et al., 2009). An example of such benefits is explored in Box 11.4.</p>
                        
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span>Evidence digest: An intervention to improve the postoperative pain experience for orthopaedic patients (Napier and Bass 2007)</h4>
                            <p>This study used a retrospective chart review to compare reports of post-operative pain, ambulation and length of stay in 41 patients who received intrathecal injections prior to total knee replacement and 44 patients who had general anaesthetic (GA) only. Epidemiological differences between the two groups did not account for any of the observed differences in the three variables under review. Findings indicated that post-operative pain scores were consistently higher for the duration of the inpatient stay for patients who had GA only. Pain on initial ambulation was also higher for the GA group and length of ambulation shorter. By the third ambulation session mean distances were similar for both groups. In total the GA group ambulated for an overall shorter distance. The authors support the use of intrathecal injections to reduce post-operative discomfort, increase ambulation and ultimately reduce length of inpatient stay.</p>

                        <h3>Pain management interventions at the site of trauma</h3>
                        <p>Treatments to minimise pain can be focused at the site of trauma itself and can combine systemic, local and non-pharmacological techniques. Knowledge of pain physiology highlights the importance of the inflammatory response at the point of trauma and any intervention which reduces this response can produce pain relief.</p>
                        <p>The most common interventions which focus on the site of trauma are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) as these are particularly useful where there is extensive tissue damage or musculoskeletal pain. They can be taken orally, per rectum, in slow relief preparations or topically. However NSAIDs are not inherently analgesics and provide pain relief simply through reducing the inflammatory response. This means that except in cases of mild pain, they should normally be used in combination with other forms of pain treatment, for their opioid sparing properties. NSAIDs work by reducing prostaglandin production through the inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) system, and newer NSAIDs have been developed which work more selectively, targeting COX-2 which is associated with trauma-related inflammation, although due to gastro intestinal side effects NSAIDs should be used with caution and they should not be used in patients with a history of gastric ulceration. There is also some concern about the effect of NSAIDs on bone healing and this should be taken into account.</p>
                        <p>Local anaesthetics can also be extremely useful for reducing pain at the site of trauma as their basic mode of action is to inhibit sodium influx preventing the nerve membrane from depolarising, hence preventing nerve impulses from achieving action potential and halting the onward transmission of pain messages to the dorsal horn of the spine. Infiltration is also a commonly used local anaesthetic method normally used during surgical procedures. A local anaesthetic agent is injected into a wound (surgical or traumatic) during suturing or wound closure and also has a longer term effect of reducing the total amount of opioid analgesia required (Girdhari and Smith 2006). Local anaesthetics can also be used to target specific nerve pathways through direct injection to create specific nerve blocks. A variety of these are available depending on the point of trauma e.g. femoral nerve block for a hip fracture. They are normally limited to pain from trauma to a limb as blocks in the abdomen, pelvis and trunk are much more difficult to achieve.</p>
                        <p>Non-pharmacological methods for relieving pain at the site of trauma should also be attempted. These include a range of simple measures which could be utilised by all practitioners (Smith and Colvin 2005):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>positioning</li>
                            <li>splinting/supporting</li>
                            <li>application of heat or cold</li>
                            <li>general comfort measures.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Pain management interventions to block onwards transmission</h3>
                        <p>As well as targeting the site of trauma, pain management interventions can also be used to prevent the onward and upward transmission of pain from the dorsal horn of the spine to the hypothalamus.</p>
                        <p>Although the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator (TENS) machines are not considered suitable for the relief of acute pain, they can have some efficacy once the initial acute phase has subsided and may be useful for patients with longer term orthopaedic conditions. TENS machines are hypothesised to work by producing mild non-noxious (non-painful) stimuli in the form of electrical impulses. Electrodes are placed above the level of injury. A mild electrical impulse then stimulates A-beta fibres to activity and these messages enter the dorsal horn of the spinal column either at the same level or above that of the A-delta and C fibres in an attempt to ‘crowd’ the ‘gate’ and prevent onwards transmission of pain messages through the spinal tract. The efficacy of TENS machines is debatable with limited evidence. As they have no known side effects and are considered effective by some patients they are always worth consideration (Mackintosh and Elson 2008).</p>
                        <p>More commonly used epidural or spinal analgesias are used to block onwards transmission of pain messages. Epidural analgesia produces pain relief by continuous administration of pharmacological agents into the epidural space via an indwelling catheter. For orthopaedic trauma and surgery the catheter is commonly inserted into the lumbar epidural space, although it can also be inserted into the thoracic space following bowel and abdominal surgery and in patients with multiple rib fractures. Spinal or intrathecal analgesia differs from epidural as it is only used for short-term pain relief and normally as part of a surgical procedure.</p>
                        <p>Commonly used pharmacological agents include local anaesthetics, normally in combination with an opioid analgesic. A range of combinations have been advocated and although it is now recognised that a combination of the two types of drugs achieves the highest efficacy for pain relief, the exact combination is subject to ongoing debate (Smith and Colvin 2005).</p>
                        <p>Epidural and spinal analgesia can produce effective pain relief, but are subject to a number of constraints:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They are both highly invasive techniques that require a skilled physician.</li>
                            <li>They require carefully monitoring as serious side effects can occur.</li>
                            <li>The nerve block achieved is non-discriminatory and although it will halt onward transmission of pain it also prevents all messages from reaching the higher senses - this means patients will be unable to mobilise or have reduced mobility, bladder and bowel emptying and need enhanced pressure area care.</li>
                            <li>They cannot be used for prolonged periods of time.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Pain management interventions to affect conscious recognition</h3>
                        <p>Once pain messages have reached the higher centres of the brain, conscious recognition of the experience takes place. However, this awareness can be modulated through use of systemic analgesics, adjunctive analgesia and non-pharmacological methods.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Systemic analgesia</h4>
                        <p>Systemic analgesia is commonly used for the treatment of all pain types. This involves the use of paracetamol and opioids and inhalational analgesia such as nitrous oxide. Paracetamol has limited anti-inflammatory action and should not be confused with aspirin which is part of the NSAID family. It is useful in mild to moderate pain, it can be safely used in combination with NSAIDs and opioids and is considered to have ‘opioid sparing’ properties i.e. when used in combination a lower opioid dose is required to achieve the same effect.</p>
                        <p>Opioids are the collective name for a group of drugs with opium-like properties which are similar to the endogenous substances the body is known to produce in response to pain. They have no peripheral action but bind to receptor sites in the central nervous system such as mu, kappa and delta receptors in the mid-brain and spinal cord where they suppress or inhibit pain transmission. Morphine is the commonest and most frequently used opioid analgesia and is the first-line systemic analgesic drug of choice for severe acute pain. It can be administered intravenously (IV), intra muscularly (IM), translingually, transdermally, orally and rectally (PR) as well as administered continuously in the form of an infusion or slow-release preparation or intermittently.</p>
                        <p>In acute pain, IV administration is the most effective way to produce fast-acting effective pain relief and should be the method of choice. IM administration should be avoided where possible as rate of take-up and action is slower and less certain than IV administration in acute situations. Once acute pain has been stabilised, transdermal or oral administration of morphine is preferred as its efficacy may be more closely monitored.</p>
                        <p>Individual opioid requirements vary up to a factor of 30 and for safe and effective use the dose should be titrated to the desired effect while minimising side effects. Side effects of systemic analgesia are frequently reported. Doses of paracetamol should be carefully monitored to ensure overdosing does not occur, as irreversible liver damage can occur. The use of opioids also engenders a range of side effects from the most commonly reported: constipation and gastric irritation, to sedation, confusion and respiratory depression. The more severe side effects are frequently over-represented and fears and misconceptions about these can lead to under-treatment of pain with opioids. Fear of addiction is also a factor which limits the appropriate and effective use of opioids. This has arisen due to misconceptions and misinformation. Addiction is extremely unlikely to occur following use of opioids for pain management in opioid-naïve patients. It should only be considered as problematic when a patient has had previous opioid use either prescribed or through illegal drug use. In either instance, where a patient has acute pain, it should not be withheld (Smith and Colvin 2005).</p>
                        <p>Nitrous oxide is more commonly known as Entonox in the UK and consists of a 50:50 mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide which produces quick-acting, short-lasting pain relief. It is commonly used as a self-administered inhalation and is extremely useful for systemic pain relief when no other options are available i.e. at an accident site or for relief of short-lasting incident-specific pain following a procedure e.g. dressing change. It has minimal short term side effects, but cannot be used as a long term inhalation as nitrous oxide can lead to the breakdown of red blood cells.</p>
                        <p>Adjuvant analgesics may also have a place in the management of traumatic and orthopaedic pain, although their use is more commonly limited to patients with longerterm or chronic pain conditions thought to derive from underlying neuropathic damage. The exact mode of action of these drugs is not fully known and continues to be subject to extensive research; however they are well recognised as having an important effect in reducing the levels of pain reported by patients with neuropathic damage (Parsons and Preece 2010). The two commonest drug groups used are: antiepileptic drugs and tricyclic antidepressants.</p>
                        <p>Carbamazapine is the commonest of the antiepileptic drugs used and has been used for the treatment of phantom limb pain. Amitriptyline has a long history of use in chronic pain, although it has now been superseded by a new generation of trycyclics, most notably gabapentin and pregabalin. Clinical guidelines for the use of these drugs are available from NICE (2010).</p>
                        <p>Both these groups of adjuvant drugs can take up to two weeks to have any noticeable effect on reducing pain, which means they are not suitable for the treatment of acute pain, but where neuropathic pain is suspected treatment should be initiated as soon as possible to allow for this delayed onset.</p>

                        <p>When considering pain management the main points can be summarised as:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A multi-modal or balanced approach will always produce the most effective pain relief.</li>
                            <li>This can be achieved by using management approaches that focus on managing pain, peripherally at the site of trauma, interfering with the transmission of pain, and altering conscious perception of pain.</li>
                            <li>Where pain management is suboptimal this is nearly always due to poor pain management practices and produces unnecessary suffering.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Pain assessment and management in orthopaedic and trauma patients adheres to the same principles regardless of the underlying condition. The varied nature of pain experienced by these patients ensures that all nurses involved in their care must be familiar with best practice across the full range of pain that an individual can experience. The management of pain is a humanistic imperative and poorly managed pain exposes patients to unnecessary suffering and is a symptom of poor practice, rather than a necessary consequence of physical trauma. Nurses should ensure that their practice reflects the current principles of best practice and that pain assessment and management for all patients is at optimum levels.</p>
