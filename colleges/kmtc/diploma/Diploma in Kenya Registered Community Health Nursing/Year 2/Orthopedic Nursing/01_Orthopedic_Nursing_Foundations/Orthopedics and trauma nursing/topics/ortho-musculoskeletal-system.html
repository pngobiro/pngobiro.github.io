                        <p>The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of musculoskeletal structure and function while relating it to human movement. Structure and function are linked and it is impossible to discuss one without the other. It is essential that orthopaedic and trauma practitioners know and understand the terms used to describe anatomical positions and the structures involved in musculoskeletal conditions, injuries and surgery to facilitate safe, high quality care. It is also essential to provide a common language which is effective in interdisciplinary communication as this ensures practitioners can explain specific conditions, injuries, surgery and treatment to other staff, patients and relatives to enable them to engage in their care.</p>

                        <p>The human body is described as being in anatomical position when the body is upright with the head facing forward, hands at the side facing forward with the thumbs pointing away from the body and the feet hip-width apart with the feet and toes pointing forward (Figure 4.1). This position is known universally. When referring to the right and left of the body it is the right and left of the person who is the subject of discussion (e.g. the patient) not the left and right of the observer.</p>

                        <p>The skeleton has two distinct sections: The axial skeleton consists of the skull bones, inner ear, ribs, vertebrae and sternum. It provides structural support, attachment points for ligaments and muscles and protection for the brain, spinal cord and major organs of the chest. The appendicular skeleton consists of the pectoral girdle and the upper limbs, pelvic girdle and lower limbs that make movement possible and protect the organs of the pelvis.</p>
                        <p>Human movement is described in three dimensions (or planes) which divide the human body (Figure 4.2):</p>

                            <li>The sagittal (vertical/median) plane - lies vertically through the body dividing it into left and right parts.</li>
                            <li>The coronal (frontal) plane - lies vertically through the body dividing it into anterior and posterior parts.</li>
                            <li>The transverse (horizontal) plane - lies horizontally through the body dividing it into superior and inferior parts.</li>

                        <p>Bone is made up mainly of collagen and mineral salts; principally calcium phosphate and some calcium carbonate with small amounts of magnesium hydroxide, fluoride and sulphate. These salts are deposited in a framework of collagen fibres which then calcify. Bone is not completely solid, with some spaces between its hard components, providing channels for blood vessels and a lighter structure. Bone tissue can be categorised into compact or cancellous (spongy) depending on the size and distribution of the spaces.</p>
                        <p>Compact bone surrounds cancellous bone and is thicker in the diaphysis (shaft) than the epiphyses (ends). It provides support and protection and helps long bones resist the stress of weight bearing. Adult compact bone has a concentric ring structure with blood vessels and nerves traversing it from the periosteum through Volkmann’s canals that connect with the blood vessels and nerves of the medullary cavity and the central Haversian canals. The Haversian canals run longitudinally through the bone and are surrounded by rings of hard calcified bone - concentric lamellae between which are spaces called lacunae which contain osteocytes. Canaliculi radiate in all directions from the lacunae, forming an intricate network providing numerous routes for nutrients to reach the osteocytes and for the removal of waste. Each central canal with the surrounding lamellae, lacunae, osteocytes and canaliculi is known as a Haversian system or osteon (see Figure 4.3).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The process of bone formation, ‘ossification’, begins in the embryo in which the ‘skeleton’ at this time is composed of fibrous membranes and hyaline cartilage shaped like bones and providing the medium for ossification. Ossification occurs in two ways:</p>
                        <p><strong>Intramembranous ossification</strong> - osteoblasts cluster in a fibrous membrane forming a centre of ossification and secrete intercellular substances partly composed of collagenous fibres which form a framework around which calcium salts are deposited (calcification). When the cluster of osteoblasts is completely surrounded by the calcified matrix, it is called a trabecula (plural trabeculae). Trabeculae radiate out from each centre of ossification into a framework. The original connective tissue becomes the periosteum and the ossified area becomes cancellous (spongy) bone with a covering of compact bone. Bone is continuously destroyed and reformed until it reaches its final adult size and shape.</p>
                        <p><strong>Endochondral ossification</strong> - the replacement of cartilage by bone. Most bones of the body are formed by this process. Early on in embryonic development a cartilage template of the future bone is laid down and covered by a membrane - the ‘perichondrium’. Midway along the shaft a blood vessel penetrates the perichondrium, stimulating osteoprogenitor cells within the perichondrium to enlarge and become osteoblasts. These cells then form osteocytes which form a periosteal collar of compact bone around the middle of the diaphysis of the cartilage model. This then forms the membranous covering of bone known as the periosteum. At the primary centre of ossification, chondrocytes hypertrophy and the matrix becomes mineralised and spaces in the shaft of the bone join together forming the medullary cavity which then fills with bone marrow. Secondary centres of ossification form at the extremities of long bones in the epiphyses and lay down spongy bone. One secondary ossification centre develops in the proximal epiphysis soon after birth and the other centre develops in the distal epiphysis during a child’s second year. After the two secondary ossification centres have formed, bone tissue completely replaces the cartilage except in two regions: cartilage continues to cover the articular surfaces of the epiphyses as ‘articular cartilage’ as well as in the region between the epiphysis and diaphysis (the ‘epiphyseal plate’) where lengthwise growth of bone continues into early adulthood.</p>
                        <p>Bones continue to grow in length and width following birth. Appositional growth is the growth in diameter of bone by the formation of new bone on the surface of existing bone. This occurs at the same time as growth in the length of bone. Bone lining the marrow cavity is destroyed by osteoclasts allowing the cavity to increase in size and at the same time osteoblasts from the periosteum produce new compact bone to cover the outer surface of the bone. The growth in length is known as endochondral growth which takes place in the epiphyseal plates until their ossification. The cartilage in the epiphysis is replaced by bone from the shaft side and this is matched by the production of new cartilage from the epiphyseal plate. This process continues until early adulthood when hormones cause the cartilage in the epiphyseal plate to ossify.</p>
                        <p>Bone growth is influenced by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>nutrition</li>
                            <li>sunlight</li>
                            <li>hormones</li>
                            <li>exercise.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Bone is constantly remodelling and re-appropriating its matrix and minerals along lines of mechanical stress allowing worn or damaged bone to be removed and replaced with new tissue. Bone also stores calcium and phosphorous. There is a delicate homeostasis maintained between the action of osteoclasts removing calcium and collagen from the bone and osteoblasts depositing calcium and collagen. If too much tissue or calcium is removed, the bones become weakened and break easily, leading to osteoporosis.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of other hormones involved in the metabolism of bone:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vitamin D (calcitriol) - regulates calcium and phosphorous levels and the mineralisation of bone.</li>
                            <li>Calcitonin - inhibits the action of osteoclasts thus inhibiting the removal of calcium from bone.</li>
                            <li>Parathyroid hormone - increases the number and activity of the osteoclasts which release calcium and phosphate from bones into blood.</li>
                            <li>Oestrogens - inhibit the activity of osteoclasts, protecting the bones from excessive bone turnover.</li>
                            <li>Human growth hormone - responsible for the general growth of bones at the epiphyseal plates.</li>

                        <p>Skeletal muscle appears striated (striped) and has the fastest contraction rate under voluntary control of all muscles. It is controlled by the central and autonomic nervous system and provides force and power for movement. Muscles contract and relax to bring about movement and perform three main functions:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>movement (voluntary and reflex) - through the actions of bones, joints and the skeletal muscles attached to the bones</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p>Skeletal muscles are composed of collections of striated muscle fibres and some connective tissues such as blood vessels and nerves. Deep fascia is a dense connective tissue that lines the body wall and extremities as well as holding muscles together and separating them into functioning groups. The entire muscle is wrapped with a fibrous connective tissue called the epimysium. Bundles of muscle fibres called fasciculi are covered by fibrous connective tissue known as perimysium and endomysium - fibrous connective tissue that penetrates into the interior of each fascicle and surrounds and separates the muscle fibres. Individual muscle fibres are long and cylindrical structures with multiple nuclei and their length and width varies depending on the function and purpose of each muscle. Each muscle fibre contains thousands of microscopic contractile units known as myofibrils that bring about contraction following electrical stimulation in a complex process of sliding filaments within the myofibrils.</p>
                        <p>Muscles are named according to their shape, location, or a combination of both and according to function e.g. flexion, extension, or rotation.</p>

                        <p>Skeletal muscles produce movement by exerting force on tendons which in turn pull on bones. When a muscle contracts it draws one articulating bone towards the other. The attachment of a muscle tendon to the stationary bone is called the origin. The attachment of the other muscle tendon to the moveable bone is known as the insertion. Levers are created by the bones and joints. Tendons attach muscles to the bone and act on the skeleton by contracting and shortening or relaxing to allow two bones to move closer or move away.</p>

                        <p>Bone has a rich blood supply from which it acquires nutrients required for growth, remodelling and repair. Large nutrient arteries enter bones through holes known as nutrient foramen into the diaphysis of the bone and then divide into the proximal and distal branches and supply the head of the bone. Blood vessels and capillaries divide from the nutrient artery and enter the central/Haversian canals to supply the compact bone. Perforating canals within the compact bone allow entry of the capillaries into the cancellous bone, supplying the nutrients required for bone cell and bone marrow activity. The central canal of long bones and central area of flat bones contain red marrow (haematopoietic tissue) which is responsible for the production of red blood cells.</p>

                        <p>Bones are held together at joints by flexible connective tissue where all movement takes place. The structure of the joint determines how it functions. Some joints permit no movement, whilst others permit slight or considerable movement. The structural classification of joints is based on whether there is a synovial cavity and the type of connective tissue that binds the bones together. Structurally joints are classified as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Fibrous Joints</strong> - lack a synovial cavity and the articulating bones fit very closely together. There is little or no movement. There are three types:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Suture</strong>- between the bones of the skull. The bones are united by a thin layer of dense fibrous connective tissue. The irregular structure of sutures gives added strength and decreases the chance of fracture. Some sutures present during growth are replaced by bone in the adult and these are called synostoses.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Syndesmosis</strong> - is a fibrous joint where the fibrous connective tissue is present in a greater amount than in a suture but the fit between the bones is not quite as tight. The fibrous connective tissue forms an interosseous membrane or ligament. The syndesmosis is slightly moveable because the bones are separated more than in a suture and some flexibility is permitted by the interosseous membrane e.g. the talofibular joint.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Gomphosis</strong> - a type of fibrous joint where a coneshaped peg fits into a socket e.g. the articulation of the roots of teeth with the sockets.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Synchondrosis</strong> - the connecting tissue is hyaline cartilage. The commonest type is the epiphyseal plate found between the epiphysis and diaphysis of a growing bone. The joint is eventually replaced by bone when growth ceases - synostosis e.g. the joint between the first rib and the sternum.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Symphysis</strong> - a cartilaginous joint in which the connecting material is a broad flat disc of fibrocartilage e.g. between the bodies of the vertebrae and the symphysis pubis. These joints are slightly moveable amphiarthrotic.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                <strong>Synovial Joints</strong> - the most common joints have a space known as the synovial cavity between the articulating bones and are freely moveable. Synovial joints have five main features:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Joint cavity</strong> - the space between articulating bones which provides the space for movement.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Articular cartilage</strong> - covers the surfaces of the articulating bones and is formed of hyaline cartilage. Prevents friction and absorbs shock.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Articular capsule</strong> - synovial joints are surrounded by a sleeve-like structure enclosing the synovial cavity and uniting the articulating bones. It is composed of two layers - the fibrous capsule and the synovial membrane. The fibrous capsule consists of dense connective tissue and is attached to the periosteum at a variable distance from the edge of the articular cartilage. The flexibility of the fibrous capsule allows for movement at the joint while its tensile strength resists dislocation.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Synovial membrane</strong> - the inner layer of the articular capsule and covers all surfaces of the joint not already covered by articular cartilage. It is composed of loose connective tissue and secretes synovial fluid.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Synovial fluid</strong> - secreted by the synovial membrane, fills the joint cavity, lubricates the joint, provides nourishment for the articular cartilage, reduces friction, supplies nutrients and removes metabolic wastes from the cells of the articular cartilage. Synovial fluid contains phagocytic cells that remove microbes and debris from wear and tear in the joint.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Synovial joints are further classified by their movement and the structures of the articulating bones:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hinge joint</strong> - the convex surface of one bone fits into the concave surface of another bone. The movement is in a single plane and is similar to that of a hinged door e.g. hinge joints are the knee, elbow and interphalangeal joints where the movement allowed is flexion and extension.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ball and Socket Joint</strong> - a ball-like surface of one bone fitted into a cuplike depression of another bone, allowing movement in three planes: flexion/ extension, abduction/adduction and rotation/circumduction e.g. the shoulder joint and hip joint. The stability of the joint depends on how deep the socket is and the fit of the ball within the socket.</li>
                            <li><strong>Plane joint (gliding)</strong> - the articulating surfaces glide against each other in one plane only and are usually flat, allowing only limited movement e.g. the joints between the carpal bones, tarsal bones and the sternum and clavicle.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pivot joint</strong> - the conical surface of one bone articulates within a ring formed partly by another bone and a ligament, allowing rotation e.g. the joint between the atlas and axis allowing rotation of the head.</li>
                            <li><strong>Condyloid joint</strong> - an oval shaped condyle of one bone fits into an elliptical cavity of another bone, allowing side to side and back and forth movements and allowing flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and circumduction e.g. the joint at the wrist between the radius and carpals.</li>
                            <li><strong>Saddle joint</strong> - the articular surface of one bone is saddle shaped and the other articular surface is shaped like a rider sitting in the saddle - a modified condyloid joint with freer movement. Movements are side to side and back and forth e.g. the joint between the trapezium and the metacarpal of the thumb. Figure 4.4 illustrates the different types of synovial joints.</li>
