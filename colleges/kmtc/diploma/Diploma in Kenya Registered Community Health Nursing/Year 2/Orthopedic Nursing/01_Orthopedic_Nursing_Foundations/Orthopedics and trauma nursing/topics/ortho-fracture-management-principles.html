                        <p>Resulting from a variety of mechanisms of injury, fractures form the bulk of orthopaedic work in the trauma setting. The care of patients with fractures demands an understanding of how injury affects bone and the surrounding soft tissue and how the process of bone repair can be facilitated through effective management and care. In spite of the relatively severe forces required to fracture a bone, skeletal injuries are extremely common and are a major reason for attending the emergency department. Fracture clinics are often the largest and busiest outpatients’ settings in any acute general hospital and sustaining a fracture is a significant reason for admission to hospital. The incidence of fracture in the general population in England, as one example, has been estimated to be as high as 3.6 fractures per 100 people per year. This represents a significant public health burden and significant cost to society (Donaldson et al., 2008). The highest incidence of fracture is found in young males from 16 to 24 years of age, often due to high energy trauma and frequently involving long bones. Conversely, those aged 65 or older primarily suffer a fracture due to falls following which the most common injuries include those occurring as fragility fractures in the wrist, proximal femur, upper humerus, vertebrae and pelvis/pubic rami as these sites are most often affected by osteoporosis. Of all musculoskeletal injuries fractures are the most serious, contributing to approximately 40% of fatalities due to trauma and associated complications. See Chapter 16 for further general information about the care and management of the patient following trauma. The present chapter mainly focuses on the principles of fracture management and care in the adult although many such principles can be applied to the care of the child and young adult. Chapters 23 and 24 specifically consider fractures in children.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Fractures involve a loss of continuity in the substance of bone. They are usually the result of different types and magnitude of blunt force. The force required to result in a fracture of the shaft of femur in a healthy person aged 25, for example, is significant and is also considerably greater than that needed to result in the fracture of a hip in the older person with osteoporotic bone. An assessment and understanding of the ‘mechanism of injury’ can provide essential information that can assist with differential diagnosis and subsequent management of fractures. This can also help identify non-accidental injury in vulnerable patients such as children (Chapter 21), adults with a learning disability, those with mental health conditions such as dementia and those with complex physical or cognitive impairment.</p>
                        <p>There are five blunt forces that commonly result in fracture:</p>
                        <p><strong>Shearing</strong> occurs when one end of a bone is motionless while the other end is bowed or bent. When a shearing force is applied, a transverse or linear fracture occurs in which one section of bone moves away from the other. This is often the result of a person attempting to stop themselves falling by putting out a hand to ‘save’ themselves; known as a ‘fall on an outstretched hand’ or FOOSH. Shearing forces are also created by a direct blow from a large instrument or object and can be significant in injures to the epiphyseal plate in children and young adults.</p>
                        <p><strong>Compression</strong> is a force that pushes inward from the end of a bone. This often causes multiple fracture lines that are widereaching and which tend to radiate from the point of impact. This type of force is most often applied to the skull or vertebral bodies. The shape of the displaced bone often reflects the instrument that has created the fracture. This mechanism is also common in fragility fractures of osteoporotic bone.</p>
                        <p><strong>Bending</strong> is the most common type of force. The force is delivered at a right angle, causing a triangular fracture, usually through its cross-section. This tends to cause fracture lines at the point of impact or on the side opposite to the break. A common fracture caused by a bending force is a ‘Parry fracture’ of the ulna, occurring when a person holds out their arms in self-defence and the impact causes inward displacement of the bone.</p>
                        <p><strong>Torsion</strong> involves twisting forces; one end of bone is held motionless while the other end is twisted, often resulting in a spiral fracture. This can occur in sporting injuries such as football and skiing and can be the result of non-accidental injury in children and babies.</p>
                        <p><strong>Tension</strong> is a force that pulls on the long axis of a bone which may cause a fracture, but more often causes dislocation of the joint. When the force is strong enough, a section of healthy bone may be pulled away by a ligament under tension; this is known as an avulsion fracture.</p>

                        <p>Fractures are described according to several criteria, often in combination:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the force involved in the fracture (mechanism of injury) e.g. compression, impacted, burst (of vertebral body), depressed (fracture of skull)</li>
                            <li>the severity of the fracture ; simple, complex, comminuted (several fragments)</li>
                            <li>the direction, appearance shape or position of the fracture line e.g. oblique, transverse, spiral, linear</li>
                            <li>the anatomical site of the fracture e.g. intertrochanteric (proximal femur), mid-shaft (femur), supracondylar (distal femur) and any articular surface involvement</li>
                            <li>special features of the fracture ; e.g. compound (open) or closed, incomplete (or ‘greenstick’), avulsion, rotation, shortening, angulation or fragmentation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some fractures are also named after the surgeon who first described them, for example Potts fracture of the ankle, Colles fracture of the wrist. Figure 17.1 shows a few examples of types of fractures (see also Figure 23.3).</p>

                        <p>The mechanism of injury determines the fracture pattern. Sudden or direct trauma, for example, typically results in a complete fracture in adults with an oblique/ transverse pattern. In children this can sometimes result in an incomplete/buckled ‘Greenstick’ fracture (Chapter 24). Indirect forces away from fracture site often produce a spiral pattern. Repetitive force on a bone causes mechanical strain and fatigue, resulting in a ‘stress’ fracture.</p>
                        <p>It is important for the nurse/practitioner to understand the terms used to describe fractures as this is the language that is used in team discussions when planning and reviewing fracture management options.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The process of fracture repair is a remarkable physiological process that results in a healed structure that, providing the conditions are right, will be as mechanically sound post-healing as prior to the fracture. It is essential that the practitioner has an understanding of the physiology of fracture healing as this has a direct bearing on the decision making and planning processes for fracture management. Each of the stages and events in the bone healing process is central to decision making regarding treatment and management options as well as influencing the care of the patient.</p>
                        <p>The process of bone healing can be broken down into several phases (Figure 17.2), but usually occurs in a seamless sequence of events. The timing of these events will vary according to the nature of the bone fractured, the type of fracture and other factors such as blood supply and the state of health of the patient. Fracture healing times are shortest, for example, in young children with incomplete fractures; sometimes as little as two or three weeks. Flat bones such as the clavicle and scapula that do not bear any weight can often heal in around six weeks. A long bone fracture (e.g. femur) in a healthy adult takes on average 12 weeks to heal, but this time is extended considerably in older patients with concurrent medical conditions and with osteoporosis/ fragility fracture. Some bones have a poorer blood supply than others and this has a significant impact on healing. Tibial fractures may take up to 24 weeks to heal even in a healthy adult.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <h4>1. Haematoma and inflammation</h4>
                        <p>In the early weeks following injury fracture healing is much like that of any other tissue. Bone is highly vascularised and as it breaks, bleeding occurs from damaged capillaries and vessels. Providing clotting and haemostatic mechanisms are working effectively, a clot rapidly forms between the two bone ends and/or amongst the fragments. This clot is essential in the healing process that follows and it quickly becomes vascularised by new blood vessels. The injury to the bone and surrounding tissue results in an initial acute inflammatory response which stimulates the migration of macrophages to the site of injury. These are central in the phagocytosis of the clot and necrotic tissue debris. Disturbance of this inflammatory process can adversely affect healing.</p>
                        <p>There are two types of specialised cells that are central to bone healing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Osteoblasts:</strong> lay down new bone matrices</li>
                            <li><strong>Osteoclasts:</strong> resorb bone enabling bone remodelling to take place.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>2. Granulation</h4>
                        <p>Gradually collagen fibres are laid down within the clot as it is absorbed by the macrophages. Mineral salts, including calcium, are deposited within the new framework. During the first few weeks after the fracture, the blood clot is invaded by macrophages and osteoclasts and the sharp bone edges are removed (Dandy and Edwards 2009).</p>
                        <h4>3. Primary callus</h4>
                        <p>Cells begin to proliferate and lay down new woven bone with collagen arranged in short bundles of fibres. This stage relies greatly on a good blood supply to the fracture site. A cuff of woven bone gradually forms, initially under the periosteum and at the ends of the bone. This brings the bone ends together externally but does not yet bridge the gap between them centrally. This stage lacks the lamellar arrangement of mature bone and as yet has little strength (Woolf 2000).</p>
                        <h4>4. Bridging callus</h4>
                        <p>Gradually the gap between the bone ends is bridged by granulation tissue and osteoblasts. Collars of subperiosteal bone begin to advance across the fracture gap. Reaching a stage where bone has formed enough bridging callus takes between 6 and 12 weeks in healthy adults, although there are differences in timing in the developing and ageing musculoskeletal system.</p>
                        <h4>5. Remodelling</h4>
                        <p>Once union has taken place and weight bearing has begun to occur, the bone is gradually reshaped and smoothed through a process of resorption. This can take up to a year. This process enables any minor displacement of bone to be rectified as the bone develops a structure that reflects the mechanical forces placed upon it. For this reason, fracture healing is greatly enhanced by weight bearing (axial loading) once bridging callus has formed and this is considered when making treatment decisions.</p>

                        <p>A full holistic assessment of the patient is an essential part of providing care for patients with fractures rather than focusing entirely on the suspected fracture. In addition to the general care and management of the traumatically injured patient described in Chapter 16, there are a number of specific considerations in relation to the patient with a fracture in the first hours following the injury.</p>
                        <p>A full history that includes the mechanism of injury should comprise:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>description of events</li>
                            <li>time since injury</li>
                            <li>pain and inability to weight bear at the time of injury and since.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Holistic assessment of the patient and injury should include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>swelling</li>
                            <li>visible deformity of the limb</li>
                            <li>assessment for any associated numbness or paraesthesia</li>
                            <li>assessment for any signs of compromised blood supply</li>
                            <li>observation for any wounds over or close to the fracture site.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The main symptom of fracture is pain. It is often this that sends the patient for treatment within minutes or hours after the initial injury. On the whole this pain is severe but there are some types of fractures (impacted fractures of the proximal femur for example) that produce less pain and may lead the patient to delay seeking treatment. Effective pain management should be provided as discussed in Chapter 11 prior to any detailed assessment of the injury. Other symptoms include swelling and reduced mobility of the affected limb/joint. There may also be a tendency to protect the limb due to tenderness and discomfort over the affected area and the patient will be reluctant to allow the practitioner to touch the limb. Loss of power, deformity of the limb and irregularity of the contour of the limb may also be noted. Crepitus (bony grating) may be also heard or felt and movement at the fracture site may have been noted by the patient at the time of injury but during examination this should not be tested for as movement at the fracture site should be avoided.</p>
                        <p>All patients with a suspected fracture require a radiographic examination. X-ray images taken from two or more angles provide the team with a detailed view of the fracture that can be used in planning treatment.</p>
                        <p>A number of ‘decision rules’ are in use in the emergency department (ED) to help the practitioner decide if a patient requires an X-ray. The most common of these are the Ottawa Ankle Rules (Stiell et al., 1994) and Ottawa Knee Rules (Stiell et al., 1997), which provide assessment criteria that have been shown by research to be predictive of fracture or otherwise and help to reduce the number of unnecessary X-rays.</p>
                        <p>While assessment and definitive treatment planning is taking place, care needs to focus on ensuring minimum mobility at the fracture site. Any movement of the fracture can lead to further soft tissue and neurovascular damage. This can, in turn, lead to increased blood loss (for this reason all patients with major long bone fractures require intravenous access and fluid replacement). The limb or body part should be carefully but firmly splinted to prevent undue movement of the fracture while the patient is being moved and assessed. No attempt should be made to change the position of the limb or ‘manipulate’ the fracture at this time. The type of splinting used will vary according to the site of the fracture. In the limbs splints should include the joint above and below the fracture. In upper limb injuries a sling can often be used to support the arm. If an unstable pelvic fracture is suspected ‘pelvic binding’ (e.g. wrapping a folder sheet around the pelvis) can be applied in order to reduce the contents of the pelvis and providing pressure to any sites of haemorrhage. Suspected spinal fractures are immobilised using a spinal board initially along with head blocks to immobilise the neck. Splints and immobilising devices should only be applied temporarily until a full assessment can be conducted. The neurovascular status of the limb should be assessed both prior to and following application of any splint (Chapter 9).</p>
                        <p>An important consideration in the initial management of fractures at the scene of injury, during transfer and in early hospital management is the management of pain. Pain can vary but is often very severe and increased by any movement. In spite of this, pain management can often be neglected both at the scene of the injury and during emergency management (Chapter 11). Pre-hospital care practitioners are increasingly able to administer both systemic and regional analgesia at the scene and it is important that good pain assessment and analgesia practice is maintained throughout the early stages of care in order to facilitate patient comfort and reduced anxiety whilst assessment and planning take place. In the case of lower limb fractures, femoral nerve blocks are increasingly used. The advantages of this approach include better facilitation of assessment with less pain, faster and more effective pain relief and avoidance of the complications of systemic analgesics (Black et al., 2012) which can be particularly important in the older person with a fracture.</p>
                        <p>It is particularly important to remember that the use of NSAIDs is contraindicated in patients with fractures as they have been shown to inhibit bone healing in a number of animal studies, although the voracity of the evidence is considered controversial (Hernandez et al., 2012). This does, however, mean that an important group of analgesics is not generally available for this group of patients and so other options must be considered carefully.</p>

                        <p>The care of patients with fractures should take into account the fact that bony injuries have a high rate of complications and can be associated with a significant physiological response to trauma. The complications of fractures are seen more often in severe fractures of long bones and the bones of the axial skeleton such as the pelvis, spine, head and chest wall as these are usually associated with high impact mechanisms of injury and are frequently combined with other injuries such as multiple fractures and significant injury to soft tissue and visceral organs. The main complications of fractures include (see Chapter 9 for further detail):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Haemorrhage</strong>-blood loss from a closed fracture of the mid shaft of the femur can, for example, amount to up to one litre and severe ‘open book’ fracture of the pelvis up to 3 litres (McRae and Esser 2008) amounting to life-threatening haemorrhage and shock.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fat Embolism</strong> and fat embolism syndrome, especially in fractures of the shaft of femur.</li>
                            <li><strong>Compartment Syndrome</strong> and other types of neurovascular injury.</li>
                            <li><strong>Infection</strong> - especially in compound fractures which can lead to osteomyelitis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Complications arising from immobility</strong> e.g. venous thromboembolism, pressure ulcers (Chapter 12), chest infection, urinary tract infection, muscle wasting, constipation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Complications arising from surgery</strong> e.g. haemorrhage and shock, haematoma, wound infection (Chapter 12), wound dehiscence.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The primary goals of fracture management are to achieve fracture healing without deformity and to restore function so that the patient can resume normal daily life (McRae and Esser 2008). Five main aspects of fracture treatment and management are summarised as the ‘five Rs’:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Resuscitation</strong> - Resuscitation of the patient following trauma is always a priority and is considered in detail in Chapter 16. Fracture and associated soft tissue trauma cause considerable bleeding and shock. First aid is fundamental when there is high suspicion of fracture (diagnosis) and immobilisation of the fracture is pivotal in preventing haemorrhage and further injury.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reduction</strong> - Some displacement of fractures can be accommodated by the healing (remodelling) process. Significant displacement, angulation or rotation need early closed reduction or open reduction with or without internal/external fixation depending on the stability of the fracture and the medical condition of the patient. Intra-articular fractures require anatomical reduction to ensure joint surfaces are maintained as much as possible.</li>
                            <li><strong>Restriction</strong> - Fractures require immobilisation to facilitate the healing process. This prevents mobility at the facture site and can take a variety of forms dictated by the initial fracture management plan.</li>
                            <li><strong>Restoration</strong> - a full understanding of the fracture gained from assessment will result in definitive management of fractures. Chapter 8 explores key musculoskeletal interventions commonly used to treat fractures. Principal approaches include one or a combination of the following:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>External methods
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>casts, splints and orthotics</li>
                                            <li>traction</li>
                                            <li>external fixation</li>
                                            <li>closed reduction</li>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>open reduction with or without internal or external fixation</li>
                                            <li>internal fixation e.g. plates, screws and intramedullary nails</li>
                                            <li>total or hemi-arthroplasty</li>

                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Rehabilitation</strong> - Following a significant period of immobilisation of several weeks or months, joints will become stiff and muscles are weakened by lack of use, even if the patient has exercised the joints not immobilised. The patient will need to gradually re-engage with movement of the limb, joints and muscles as strength and flexibility gradually improve. In some cases this journey will depend on a number of factors including the severity of the injury, the medical and general fitness of the patient and their motivation to reach their rehabilitation potential (see Chapter 7 for further discussion of the principles of rehabilitation). This may require a period of outpatient physiotherapy. Some patients may have residual disability following rehabilitation.</li>

                        <p>An understanding of what encourages and inhibits fracture healing is helpful in understanding the conditions required for healing and those interventions likely to be most effective in supporting healing. Numerous factors may mean that fractures do not heal (non-union) or heal slowly (slow or delayed union) or do not heal in good/anatomic position (malunion).</p>
                        <p>Fracture healing is encouraged by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Firm (but not too tight) immobilisation of the fracture in the early stages of healing so that the gradually revascularised haematoma is not disrupted.</li>
                            <li>Axial loading (weight bearing) once bridging callus has formed to enable new bone to be laid down along lines of stress.</li>
                            <li>Good general health and diet which provides the protein, calories, calcium and other nutrients required to physiologically support healing.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Fracture healing is inhibited by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Movement at the fracture site during the earlier stages of healing as this disrupts newly forming capillaries.</li>
                            <li>Poor circulation to the fracture site reducing the availability of oxygen and the nutrients required for healing.</li>
                            <li>Diseased and weakened bone (e.g. osteoporosis) in which bone cells are less active.</li>
                            <li>Joint involvement. Synovial fluid inhibits healing. Disruption of articular (hyaline) cartilage often leads to secondary osteoarthritis is later life.</li>
                            <li>Large amounts of surrounding soft-tissue damage.</li>
                            <li>Infection.</li>
                            <li>Some drugs, especially NSAIDs, as these have been shown to inhibit healing because they dampen down the much needed inflammatory response.</li>
                            <li>Poor general health and nutrition.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Open, or compound, fractures occur when there is a break in the skin, providing a conduit between the external environment and the fracture. There are two mechanisms by which this can occur:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>From without in. External injury to the skin and soft tissues overlying the fracture opens a wound that connects with the fracture.</li>
                            <li>From within out. Sharp edges of the fracture lacerate overlying soft tissue and pierce the skin. This mechanism can also result in a fracture blister. Fluid of blood-filled blisters lie over the fracture and, although the skin might not be broken, should be treated as a compound fracture wound.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Open fractures are associated with significant soft tissue damage and, as a consequence, are at significant risk of infection. All open fractures must be assumed to be contaminated and the main aim of treatment is to prevent infection. In the emergency setting, the wound should be photographed so that repeated uncovering is avoided and then covered with a sterile dressing on presentation. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered and tetanus immunisation status evaluated. Open fractures require early operation and ideally this should be performed within six hours of injury. In the event that early surgery does not take place, stabilisation with external fixation is recommended (BOA/BAPRAS 2007: see Box 17.1).</p>
                        <p>Aims of surgery are to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>clean the wound</li>
                            <li>remove devitalised tissue</li>
                            <li>stabilise the fracture.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Small clean wounds can be sutured but large dirty wounds debrided and left open. Debrided wounds can be closed by delayed primary suture at five days. Postoperative wound management is a challenge and some centres now employ Negative Wound Pressure Therapy as a wound management strategy (Blum et al., 2012). If there has been significant soft tissue loss, reconstruction will be required under the care of a plastic surgeon.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span>Evidence digest: Management of open fractures (BOA/BAPRAS 2009)</h4>
                            <p>Standards from BOA/BAPRAS (2009) offer an evidencebased approach to the management of patients with complex injuries of the lower limb that include a fracture and significant associated soft tissue injury – an open or compound fracture – which most often occur in the lower leg. It is based on guidelines developed by representatives of two specialist medical associations with an interest in these complex injuries which often result in disability and amputation. Although the guidelines were generated by a group of orthopaedic and plastic surgeons, they have great relevance to the entire trauma team including nurses and other practitioners.</p>
                            <p>The guidelines illustrate clearly how it is not always possible to base practice on ‘higher’ levels of evidence such as randomised trials when these are few or are conflicting, as is the case in this aspect of care. The authors have, however, been able to draw on other forms of evidence both in publications and clinical experience and expertise to put the evidence in context and offer clinicians a set of useful practical recommendations for ‘best’ practice. The document shows how ‘evidence-based’ does not always mean based on randomised controlled trials of interventions and how other forms of evidence can be central in ensuring effective care. In particular the recommendations focus on the need for a multidisciplinary approach to care that meets the needs of patients with these complex injuries and facilitates careful, expert management of both the skeletal and the soft tissue injury.</p>
                            <p>Practitioners need to take note, in particular, of their responsibilities for wound care, assessment for neurovascular complications and the rehabilitation and psychosocial support of the patient and family. What the document also illustrates is how important it is that nursing and other non-medical staff have an in-depth knowledge of treatment decisions and options so that the care they provide can take into account that knowledge and understanding, particularly in making sure that patients receive adequate support and information during their care journey.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>A ‘Gustilo’ (Gustilo et al., 1984) classification system (Table 17.1) is commonly used to describe soft tissue injury associated with a compound fracture and is used to direct treatment. The use of a classification system is important as it facilitates communication among clinicians, as well as assisting clinicians in decision making, anticipating potential problems, suggesting treatment options, predicting patient and surgical outcomes and documenting cases. However there are discussions regarding the inter-observer reliability of the Gustilo classification plus its ability to predict patient outcome. Other classifications systems include the Mangled Extremity Severity score (MESS) (Johansen et al., 1990). Management of the open fracture depends on the site of injury and type of fracture. The wound is subsequently stabilised either temporarily or definitively. If soft-tissue coverage over the injury is inadequate, soft-tissue transfers or free flaps are performed when the wound is clean and the fracture is definitively treated. Closed reduction should be performed initially for any fracture that is displaced, shortened or angulated. This is achieved by applying traction to the long axis of the injured limb and then reversing the mechanism of injury/fracture, followed by subsequent immobilisation through casting or splinting. Splints and casts can be used with barriers to accomplish reduction including soft tissue interposition and hematoma formation that create tension in the soft tissues.</p>

                        <p>This section of the chapter provides an overview of the common upper and lower limb fractures in adults. Spinal and hip fractures are further explored in Chapters 19 and 18 respectively with Chapters 23 and 24 dedicated to fractures in the infant, child and young person.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Lower limb fractures</h3>
                        <p>The bones of the lower limb play an important role in standing and ambulation. Fractures in this region, therefore, have a significant impact on patient mobility and ability to carry out activities of daily living and employment. They also commonly require admission to hospital. The femur and tibia are major long bones which bear the most significant weight in standing and walking. They require significant force to fracture and are, therefore, likely to be associated with patterns of multiple injury and significant soft tissue damage and are the most prone to complications. Fractures around the ankle and foot have different mechanisms and patterns of injury but can also have a significant impact on patient independence.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Fractures involving the femur</h4>
                        <p>Fractures can involve any part of the femur. Fractures at the proximal end of the femur between the femoral head and greater and lesser trochanters often occur as fragility fractures in older people. These are considered in detail in Chapter 18. Fractures of the diaphyseal shaft of the femur are classified in three sections:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>proximal third (subtrochanteric)</li>
                            <li>middle third</li>
                            <li>distal third and femoral condyles.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The emergency management of the patient with a fracture of the femur requires full consideration of the principles of resuscitation and advanced trauma life support as considered in Chapter 16.</p>
                        <p>Many fractures of the femur are often displaced, angulated or shortened because of the action of the large muscles of the thigh. The management of femoral shaft fractures is most often by open reduction and internal fixation with an intramedullary nail. If the fixation is stable it allows early mobilisation, reducing the risk of complications due to immobility. Conservative management of fractures is most common in children and older people who are unfit for anaesthetic. Fractures of the femoral component of the knee joint often involve the articular surface of the joint and are significantly displaced. They are difficult to internally fix because intramedullary nails have difficulty obtaining fixation of the bone so close to a major joint. Specifically designed plates, screws and wires are often used, but fixation can be unstable.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Fractures involving the tibia</h4>
                        <p>Tibial fractures occur due to a major impact to the lower leg. The tibia is particularly vulnerable to twisting (torsion) forces and fractures are often spiral, sometimes involving the knee or ankle joint and X-ray images should include both joints. In this part of the leg the anterior tibial border lies very close to the surface and is covered by only a thin layer of skin and adipose tissue. This anatomy not only makes this bone very vulnerable to injury but means that open fractures are common. In addition the blood supply to both the bone and overlying soft tissue is problematic resulting in fractures that heal more slowly and with more complications than others. Swelling and neurovascular compromise are significant problems following tibial fractures. It is essential therefore that care includes elevation of the lower leg preferably using a Braun frame so that elevation can be achieved which raises the ankle above the level of the heart.</p>
                        <p>Tibial shaft fractures affect the region between the knee and ankle joint along the diaphysis of the tibia. It is the most common diaphyseal fracture and mechanisms of injury can include both low and high impact, torsional forces, repeated stress and minor trauma to pathologically weakened bone. It is most common in young adult males following road traffic trauma and sporting injuries. Undisplaced fractures can be treated conservatively with a long leg cast with a walking heel added once there is evidence of callus formation on X-rays. Displaced fractures often respond to closed reduction and a long leg cast. After 4-6 weeks a Sarmiento cast or functional cast brace may be applied. Definitive treatment of displaced unstable fractures requires either internal fixation with an intramedullary nail or external fixation with an circular frame.</p>
                        <p>Other fractures of the tibia, the ankle and in the foot are considered in Table 17.2 which provides an overview of lower limb fractures and some management options.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Upper limb fractures</h3>
                        <p>Fractures of the upper limb are the most common site of injury. They are particularly common following a fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH) in all age groups, especially in older people. Other common mechanisms include a blow to the arm and twisting injuries. Injuries often occur as a result of sport and leisure activities, workplace incidents and social violence. They can also be part of a pattern of multiple injuries following high energy trauma associated with other significant fractures of the lower limb, pelvis, chest, spine or head.</p>
                        <p>Injury and immobility of the upper limb can cause significant problems for the patient in carrying out activities of living such as personal hygiene and eating and drinking, especially if the dominant arm is affected. Elderly frail people, in particular, need significant support in coping during the period of immobilisation. Swelling is a significant issue in the upper limb. This can be managed by elevation of the limb using a sling or splint and encouraging the patient to regularly exercise those joints not included in the cast or splint following medical and physiotherapy guidance. ‘Neighbour’ strapping is often used to immobilise the fracture in finger injuries. It is essential, like all strapping, that this is not too tight and that the neurovascular status of the fingers is regularly checked, especially if swelling is a feature. Re-strapping may be required if swelling increases as well as when it subsides.</p>
                        <p>Treatment depends on the specific injury pattern, associated injuries, bone quality and the patient’s functional status/physical demands. Like all fractures, those in the upper limb can be classified as simple or complex. Simple fractures without associated ligamentous disruption include isolated fracture of the radius or ulna, or both, and often occur as a result of direct trauma. They may be open or closed, displaced or un-displaced, comminuted or displaced, impacted and angulated. Complex fractures with ligamentous disruption disrupt either the proximal/distal or both radio-ulnar articulations, and part or all of the interosseous membrane.</p>
                        <p>Complications of fractures in the upper limb and their management include neurovascular compromise, damage to tendons and compartment syndrome. Late complications include carpal tunnel syndrome, malunion, post traumatic arthritis and residual stiffness of the elbow, wrist and fingers.</p>
                        <p>Table 17.3 provides an overview of upper limb fractures and some management options.</p>

                        <p>Ensuring that practice is evidence-based through both conduct and use of research and audit is essential in setting standards for improving quality of care for patients and ensuring that their fracture has the best possible healing outcome. There is a large body of medical research that considers various aspects of the management of fractures. Research projects around the world are constantly comparing fracture treatment methods against others using randomised controlled trial and other robust research methods. Examples of such trials might include comparing the use of intramedullary nailing versus the use of external fixation or the use of BMP2 (Bone morphogenetic protein 2) to stimulate the production of bone. There is also a good deal of research that has considered the role of physiotherapy in recovery and rehabilitation following skeletal injury. Research for nursing practice is often focussed on general aspects of fracture care considered in more detail in other chapters of this book, such as wound and pain management, the prevention of complications and rehabilitation. The care of the patient following a fragility fracture of the hip is particularly well researched (Chapter 18).</p>
                        <p>Many health care providers are now engaged in audit of data about fracture outcomes. Such systems aim to produce valid, accurate, consistent and timely data focusing on fracture management options and measuring performance to facilitate evidence-based practice through audit and research. Audit is a quality improvement process that aims to improve patient care and outcomes through systemically reviewing care against explicit criteria. It is often followed by the implementation of change and practice development. The key component of clinical audit is that the performance is reviewed (or audited) to ensure that what should be done is being done and, if not, that it provides a framework to enable improvements to be made. Information is gathered regarding different types of fractures, their classifications, their treatment and the outcomes of that treatment. This provides information about the effectiveness of fracture management in a given unit, but also enables the sharing of good practice between units through benchmarking. Audit data captured should include demographic data, accident dates and times, dates and times of presentation to health service, admission to fracture units, time to surgery and discharge dates and times as well as discharge destinations and information about fracture management. A particularly successful example of this is provided by the National Hip Fracture Database in the UK (with many equivalents elsewhere in the world), described in more detail in Chapter 18. This has enabled the use of audit data to drive improvements in care for this specific group of patients.</p>
