                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Soft tissue swellings are a common presentation to primary care physicians and a cause of great anxiety to patients when they discover a lump in their limb or trunk which they interpret as a cancer. In fact malignant tumours are very rare and benign tumours are much more common in a ratio of more than 100:1. These tumours frequently cause problems in diagnosis and treatment because of the difficulty in differentiating them from other, much commoner, causes of lumps and swellings in the limbs. These include cysts and ganglia around joints, normal muscle variants, muscle rupture, haematoma, vascular aneurysm, and myositis ossificans.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Normal muscle variants</h3>
                            <p>These can present as a clinically palpable mass. They have presumably been present for years but for some reason the patient has only just noticed the swelling. One of the commonest sites is at the ankle where an accessory soleus muscle may mimic a soft tissue mass. Knowledge of the normal anatomy will assist in making the diagnosis along with the observation that the area of interest has identical signal to adjacent muscle on all MR sequences. The palmar aspect of the wrist is another area where anomalous developments in the flexor tendons may sometimes result in compression of the ulnar or median nerves in their fibro-osseous tunnels.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Muscle tears</h3>
                            <p>Symptomatic muscle tears are not usually a problem since there is typically a history of trauma and painful onset of swelling. Clinically there is therefore no suggestion that this is a soft tissue mass. However some patients, particularly in an older age group, present with a painless swelling with no clear history of any single incident to account for it. Characteristically this is seen in the anterior thigh. The reason is spontaneous rupture of rectus femoris muscle. The proximal muscle can contract unopposed with a resulting soft tissue mass palpable in the thigh. In cases of clinical doubt an MRI scan will confirm that the swelling is muscle and demonstrate the defect at the site of rupture (see Fig. 18.29, p. 414).</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Haematoma</h3>
                            <p>An acute tissue haematoma, whether from injury or post-surgery, should not pose a problem for clinical diagnosis. Difficulty can occur when a large deep haematoma does not resolve and enters a chronic phase that may mimic the swelling from a recurrent lesion. The MRI scan should aid diagnosis showing a peripheral dark rim from the presence of iron-containing haemoglobin breakdown products (Fig. 10.1).</p>

They are seen most commonly around the wrist and ankle, but also occur near the knee arising from the proximal tibio fibular joint (Fig. 10.2).</p>

                            <p>Synovial cysts are a synovial lined outpouching which connects with the underlying joint space.</p>
                            <p>These therefore occur around joints most commonly and are typically seen especially in the knee. Popliteal (Baker's) cysts (Fig. 18.32A, p. 418) and cysts associated with meniscal tears can present as palpable soft tissue masses. Ultrasound is the easiest method of confirming that these are cystic and not solid lesions.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Myositis ossificans (heterotopic ossification)</h3>
                            <p>This is an uncommon but troublesome lesion because of its apparent malignant behaviour. It presents as a painful and tender lump in a limb muscle, with or without a history of recent trauma to the site. Imaging is crucial to obtain the correct diagnosis and MRI and ultrasound are the most useful in the very early stages as they can detect the presence of calcification in the lesion which is the key to diagnosis (Fig. 10.3A). Later imaging with CT scanning will reveal a diagnostic rim of ossification at the periphery of the well-circumscribed lesion. Plain radiographs after several weeks will show some calcification in the muscle which should indicate the correct diagnosis (Fig. 10.3B). However, in some patients where the early changes are not recognised these appearances may be misinterpreted and may lead to a presumed diagnosis of soft tissue osteosarcoma. This assumption may be reinforced if a biopsy is performed, as this will show a very active lesion containing immature mesenchymal cells with atypical nuclei and osteoid formation. No active treatment is required, other than careful observation, as the lesion will resolve in 2-3 months.</p>

                            <p>Tumours arising from nerves are of two types: schwannomas and neurofibromas.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Schwannoma</h4>
                            <p>These are just a little less common than neurofibromas. They are slow growing and painless with no neurological symptoms. They are typically less than 5 cm in size. The tumour usually lies eccentric to the nerve which is displaced. Surgical excision can thus be undertaken with sparing of the nerve.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Neurofibroma</h4>
                            <p>These are a little commoner and present as a soft, circumscribed, rounded, and slightly tender swelling in the skin or deeper tissues. They are more often associated with neurological symptoms. Pathologically they are not separate from the nerve which can be seen entering and leaving the tumour. Thus resection of the tumour requires sacrifice of the involved nerve.</p>
                            <p>Histologically the tumour is composed of cellular fibrous tissue arranged in whorls. The tumour may be solitary; but in the condition known as multiple neurofibromatosis (von Recklinghausen's disease) (p. 70) numerous tumours are associated with pigmented areas in the skin. A neurofibroma growing within the spinal canal is an important cause of compression of the spinal cord or cauda equina.</p>
                            <p>Imaging with MR scanning can identify the nature of the lesion and sometimes its neural origin (Fig. 10.4).</p>

                            <p>A lipoma is a common tumour that may arise in almost any part of the body. It usually occurs in the subcutaneous tissues, but may also develop more deeply as an intramuscular lesion. It forms a soft, often large, lobulated mass enclosed within a thin capsule. It consists of fat, usually with little connective tissue stroma. When the lesion is deep to fascia and of a large size it may be difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds from malignant liposarcoma. Imaging by MRI may be diagnostic of lipoma if it shows a homogeneous white lesion on the T1 weighted image with the same density as the subcutaneous and intramedullary fat (Fig. 10.5). However where there is less than $75 \%$ of fat in the lesion, or if the septation is nodular rather than linear, there is a possibility of malignancy and a biopsy is required prior to surgical excision.</p>
                            <p>Treatment, if required, is by local excision and the specimen when removed must always be sent for histological examination.</p>

                            <p>Haemangioma is a benign tumour of blood vessels, usually present at birth. A capillary haemangioma forms a dark red, irregular, slightly raised blotch on the skin ('port wine stain'). It is usually congenital. A cavernous haemangioma is composed of widely dilated vascular channels with intervening connective tissue. It forms a localised or diffuse tumour within the skin, subcutaneous tissue, or muscle. A characteristic feature of diagnostic importance is that the tumour is compressible and may vary in size from day to day. It may cause symptoms from its cosmetic appearance, or from the complication of thrombosis, which may be associated with local pain and swelling. When a cavernous haemangioma occurs in a massive form in a limb it may lead to marked increase in growth of the limb as a whole (elephantiasis).</p>
                            <p>Imaging by MR scanning shows characteristic clusters of abnormal dilated blood vessels giving a variegated serpiginous appearance.</p>
                            <p>Treatment. Superficial capillary haemangiomata fall within the province of the plastic surgeon or dermatologist. Some are amenable to laser ablation therapy. A localised deep cavernous haemangioma is usually amenable to excision. Extensive diffuse tumours cannot be eradicated, but improvement may follow transcutaneous arterial embolisation. In the worst cases amputation may be required.</p>

                            <p>This rare tumour occurs mostly in young adults as a slowly growing hard swelling in the musculo-aponeurotic tissues, particularly in the trunk and shoulder regions. When it involves the abdominal wall or arises intra-abdominally it is known as an abdominal desmoid tumour. It is important because of its histological resemblance to malignant sarcoma and the characteristic infiltrative growth locally. Imaging by MRI scans will show a variable degree of heterogeneity (Fig. 10.6), which is not diagnostic, but will show the extent of the lesion and any involvement of neuro-vascular structures. Biopsy and histological examination will differentiate it from sarcoma and fortunately it has a more benign course and never metastasises. However, there is a high $30-40 \%$ risk of local recurrence, even after radical wide-margin excision, suggesting that it may arise from multicentric foci in the same limb.</p>

                            <p>Malignant tumours of soft tissue (soft-tissue sarcomas) are uncommon, comprising $1 \%$ of adult malignant neoplasms. Of mesenchymal origin, they arise from connective tissues such as fascia, aponeurosis, tendon sheath, intermuscular septa, voluntary muscle, and synovial membrane. Such a tumour presents difficulties both in diagnosis and in treatment. It may be hard to distinguish from its benign counterpart, presenting as a progressively enlarging but usually painless swelling. It is of firm consistency and may appear to be well localised, though this is usually a false impression. It may spread widely within the soft tissues and the surrounding pseudocapsule forms no barrier. Metastasis occurs through the blood stream, mainly to the lungs.</p>
                            <p>Investigation of these tumours is aided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI scans provide good definition of the anatomical extent of the tumour and of its relationship to the neurovascular structures (Fig. 10.7), thereby allowing correct planning of surgical treatment. However the scans cannot reliably differentiate between benign and malignant lesions, which must ultimately depend on expert histological examination from a representative biopsy.</p>

                            <p>Imaging with MRI scans is not diagnostic. These lesions do not contain macroscopic fat despite their name. MR scanning is generally non-specific and there is no fat signal from most of these lesions.

It has a poor prognosis, with early pulmonary metastases or spread to local lymph nodes. Histologically the tumour is composed of masses of fusiform cells, but the picture is characterised by the formation of spaces or clefts lined by cuboidal cells which suggest the formation of a synovial cavity - hence the name given to this tumour. Treatment is by wide excision if this is practicable, with pre-operative and post-operative radiotherapy. When the tumour involves a joint amputation offers the best hope of survival.</p>

                            <p>While the above descriptions and classification of lesions is helpful, in clinical practice it is likely that after taking a history and examining the patient a definitive diagnosis is not possible.</p>
                            <p>It is often stated that small superficial lesions are likely to be benign and that larger $>5 \mathrm{~cm}$ lesions, especially if deeply placed, are likely to be malignant. While this is statistically correct there are far too many lesions that break this rule of thumb to make it a sensible basis for clinical management.</p>
                            <p>It is now mandatory to proceed to some sort of imaging to confirm the suspected diagnosis. Ultrasound scanning is the quickest and easiest way of determining the nature of the majority of soft tissue swellings. Cystic lesions, haematomas, muscle tears and some lipomas can be identified this way. For the rest an MRI scan will be needed. When a definite diagnosis cannot be made then a biopsy is required.</p>
                            <p>The practice of removing lesions without going through these steps leads unfortunately to the rare but disastrous occasions when a lesion is excised and this turns out on histology to be a malignant sarcoma. The patient's best chance of a surgical cure is then seriously compromised.</p>

                            <p>Inflammation may occur in a normally situated bursa or in an adventitious bursa. It may arise from mechanical irritation or from bacterial infection.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Irritative bursitis</h4>
                            <p>This is caused by excessive pressure or friction, occasionally by a gouty deposit. There is a mild inflammatory reaction in the wall of the bursa, and there is usually an effusion of clear fluid within the sac. Examples are the common 'bunion' that forms over a prominent metatarsal head in hallux valgus, prepatellar bursitis or 'housemaid's knee', olecranon bursitis (sometimes caused by gout), and subacromial bursitis.</p>
                            <p>Treatment. In many cases the inflammation subsides with rest if continued pressure or friction is prevented. If the sac is distended the fluid may be aspirated, and the instillation of hydrocortisone through the aspiration needle may help to prevent recurrence. In resistant cases cure can be effected only by operative excision of the bursa.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Infective bursitis</h4>
                            <p>There may be acute inflammation from infection by an organism of the pyogenic group, or chronic inflammation as in tuberculous bursitis. Examples of acute pyogenic bursitis are infected bunion, infected prepatellar bursitis, and infected olecranon bursitis. A bursa that is sometimes affected by tuberculosis is the trochanteric bursa.</p>
                            <p>Treatment. Treatment of acute suppurative bursitis is by surgical drainage and antibacterial drugs. In chronic bursitis excision of the bursa is required.</p>

                            <p>The term tenosynovitis implies inflammation of the thin synovial lining of a tendon sheath as distinct from its outer fibrous sheath. Like bursitis, tenosynovitis may be caused by mechanical irritation or by bacterial infection.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Irritative (frictional) tenosynovitis and peritendinitis</h4>
                            <p>This is caused by excessive friction from over-use. The synovial sheath is mildly inflamed and there is an exudate of watery fluid within it, visible on ultrasound scanning (Fig. 10.9). A similar traumatic inflammation may affect the flimsy paratenon surrounding those tendons that are devoid of synovial sheaths. This is termed paratendinitis and is a common problem around the wrist and hand. The controversial condition known as repetitive stress syndrome comes into this category (p.327).</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Infective tenosynovitis</h4>
                            <p>Bacterial infection of a tendon sheath may be acute or chronic. Acute infective (suppurative) tenosynovitis is caused by an organism of the pyogenic group. There is an acute inflammatory reaction in the wall of the sheath, with a purulent exudate from it. It is an uncommon condition, but it is well recognised in the flexor tendon sheaths in the hand (p.316).</p>
                            <p>In chronic bacterial tenosynovitis, also an uncommon lesion in Western countries, the infection is often tuberculous. The synovial wall is much thickened and there is a fibrinous exudate. The flexor sheaths of the forearm and hand are the usual sites (compound palmar ganglion, p.317).</p>

                            <p>In tenovaginitis there is a mild chronic inflammation or thickening of the fibrous wall of a tendon sheath as distinct from the synovial lining. The cause is unknown: it is not due to bacterial infection. The only common sites are the mouths of the fibrous flexor sheaths in the fingers or thumb ('trigger' finger, p. 329), and the sheaths of the extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus tendons at the radial side of the wrist (de Quervain's syndrome, p. 328).</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA</h3>
                            <p>This connective tissue disorder has been recognised with increased frequency in older patients presenting with pain and stiffness in the muscles of the neck and shoulder girdle, or sometimes the low back and buttock regions. Because of these features it may be confused with degenerative disc disease, though characteristically the associated symptoms of malaise, low-grade fever, night sweats, and loss of weight should lead to the diagnosis. It tends to be commoner in women than in men, usually affecting patients over the age of 60 years, and in about one-third of cases it is associated with the condition of giant-cell arteritis. This is a more serious disease as it may lead to sudden blindness because of involvement of the cranial arteries.</p>
                            <p>The clinical features are ill-defined muscle pain around the shoulders or low back, with associated stiffness, and the characteristic features of systemic disturbance. When giant-cell arteritis is also present there may be marked tenderness over the temporal arteries. There may be marked elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, but the rheumatoid factor is negative. When associated giant-cell arteritis is suspected on clinical grounds, urgent administration of prednisolone in high doses is advisable pending confirmation of the diagnosis by biopsy, in order to reduce the risk of blindness. Both conditions show a good response to steroid therapy, usually in a dose of 15 mg of prednisolone daily. Once the clinical features have subsided this may be reduced to a maintenance dose of 5 mg daily.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">FIBROMYALGIA (FIBROSITIS)</h3>
                            <p>Fibromyalgia, formerly termed fibrositis, is a clinical rather than a pathological entity. Some deny its existence. Certainly its nature is obscure. Nevertheless the term is a useful label for a common clinical condition that at present lacks a complete explanation. The main features are pain in certain muscles, with tenderness when they are gripped or squeezed. Small firm nodules may be felt. Joint movements are full and there are no other objective signs. The condition is commonest in the muscles of the upper back, especially in the trapezius area, and affects women more frequently than men. There may be associated tiredness, sleep disturbance, and depression. Treatment, if required, is by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication and active exercises.</p>
