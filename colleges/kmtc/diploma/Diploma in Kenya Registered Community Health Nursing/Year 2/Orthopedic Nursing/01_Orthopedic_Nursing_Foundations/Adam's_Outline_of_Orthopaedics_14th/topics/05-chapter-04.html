                        <p>Orthopaedic treatment falls into three categories:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">

                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="list-marker">2</span>
                                <span class="list-content">non-operative treatment</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="list-marker">3</span>
                                <span class="list-content">operative treatment.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>In every case these three possibilities of treatment should be considered one by one in the order given. At least half of the patients attending orthopaedic out-patient clinics (excluding cases of fracture) do not need treatment: all that they need is reassurance and advice. In many cases the sole reason for the patient's attendance is a fear that there may be cancer, tuberculosis, impending paralysis, crippling arthritis, or other serious disease. If reassurance can be given that there is no evidence of serious disease the patient goes away satisfied, and the symptoms immediately become less disturbing.</p>
                        <p>If active treatment seems to be required it is a good general principle that whenever practicable a trial should be given first to non-operative measures; though obviously there are occasions when early or indeed immediate operation must be advised. Most orthopaedic operations fall into the category of 'luxury' rather than life-saving procedures. Consequently the patient should seldom be persuaded to submit to operation: rather the surgeon should have to be persuaded to undertake it. When one is undecided whether to advise conservative treatment or operation it is wise always to err on the side of non-intervention.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Rest</h3>
                            <p>Since the days of H. O. Thomas (p. 3), who, more than a century ago, emphasised its value in diseases of the spine and limbs, rest has been one of the mainstays of orthopaedic treatment. Complete rest demands recumbency in bed which, for the most part, is deprecated today - or immobilisation of the diseased part in plaster. But by 'rest' the modern orthopaedic surgeon does not usually mean complete inactivity or immobility. Often he means no more than 'relative rest', implying simply a reduction of accustomed activity and avoidance of strain. Indeed complete rest is enjoined much less often now than it was in the past, because diseases for which rest was previously important, such as poliomyelitis or tuberculosis, can now be prevented or are more readily amenable to specific remedies such as antibacterial agents. Complete rest after operations, formerly favoured, has given place in most cases to the earliest possible resumption of activity.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Support</h3>
                            <p>Rest and support often go together; but there are occasions when support is needed but not rest - for example, to stabilise a joint rendered insecure by muscle paralysis, or to prevent the development of deformity. When support is to be temporary it can be provided by a cast or splint made from plaster of Paris or from one of the newer splinting materials. When it is to be prolonged or permanent an individually made surgical appliance, or orthosis, is required. Examples in common use are spinal braces, cervical collars, wrist supports, walking calipers, knee and ankle orthoses, and devices to control drop foot (Figs 11.3-11.5, pp. 177-8).</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Physiotherapy</h3>
                            <p>Physiotherapy in its various forms occupies an important place in the non-operative and post-operative treatments of orthopaedic disabilities. Emphasis on evidence-based practice has helped to produce an awareness among physiotherapists of the hazards as well as the merits of treatment. This has led to a correct emphasis being placed upon the value in many conditions of active rather than of passive treatment: in other words, of helping the patient to help him/herself. This approach is particularly rewarding in the rehabilitation of patients after injury or after operations, and in diseases such as poliomyelitis, cerebral palsy, hemiplegia, peripheral nerve palsies and mechanical low back pain. When it is used, physiotherapy should be pursued thoroughly. A number of different physiotherapy interventions have evolved over the years. These may be active, passive or a combination of the two. Passive approaches involve a range of different techniques carried out on the patient by the therapist. Active approaches require active involvement by the patient, either by exercising or changing behaviour.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Active intervention</h4>
                            <p>Physiotherapists use the term physical activity, exercise and physical fitness to describe active interventions, but they are often used loosely and interchangeably. The term 'exercise' is used to include a range of methods from isometric stabilising exercise through to intensive aerobic fitness programmes. Exercise programmes aim to (1) strengthen specific muscles, (2) stretch soft tissues, (3) mobilise joints and (4) improve coordination of muscles. Exercise to improve coordination is of particular importance in cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, ankle and knee injuries.</p>
                            <p>Physical fitness is a multi-dimensional concept that has been defined as a set of attributes that people possess or achieve that relates to the ability to perform physical activity, and is comprised of skill-related, health-related and physiological components. Physical fitness programmes vary in intensity, design and delivery and are generally supervised in a group, but can be offered to patients on an individual basis. They usually include aerobic exercise with an aim to improve overall cardiovascular fitness, as well as specific exercises.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Hydrotherapy</h4>
                            <p>Hydrotherapy is a valuable way of allowing active pain-free movements of all joints in warm water. The warmth and buoyancy of the water relieve the muscle spasm and can help to reduce pain and increase the range of movement. Hydrotherapy is often particularly useful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Passive interventions</h4>
                            <p>These techniques are carried out by the therapist and do not require any active participation by the patient. The chief use of passive movements, or 'mobilisation' is to preserve full mobility when the patient is unable to move the joint actively - i.e. when the muscles are paralysed or severed. They are important after nerve injuries, especially to preserve mobility in the hand, and in poliomyelitis in countries where it still occurs. Recently, the use of machines to provide continuous passive motion of joints after operation or injury has become popular to minimise complications and encourage healing of articular cartilage.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Manual therapy</h4>
                            <p>Manual therapy includes a wide range of joint mobilisation and manipulation techniques used by osteopaths and chiropractors, as well as physiotherapists. It also includes mobilisation of soft tissue. The manipulation can be high-velocity thrust applied at the end of joint range (such as to spinal joints) or a more gentle passive low-velocity mobilisation applied in various parts of the available joint range.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Soft-tissue techniques</h4>
                            <p>Soft-tissue techniques include interventions that aim to mobilise soft tissue, either by massage or passive stretching techniques. Massage techniques range from Swedish massage to deep connective tissue massage and stretching of neural tissue.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Traction</h4>
                            <p>Traction for the spine is carried out both manually or using a motorised traction couch. The duration and magnitude of force can be varied, and if motorised traction is applied it can be carried out continuously or intermittently. The rationale for the use of traction therapy is based on the mechanical effects of traction on the spine, mainly stretching structures. These mechanisms are thought to cause separation of the vertebrae, widening of the intervertebral foramina, movement of the facet joints and stretching of spinal muscles and ligaments. The proposed mechanisms are not supported by research findings.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Electrotherapy</h4>
                            <p>The theoretical basis for the use of these modalities is weak and they are not recommended in national or international guidelines. However, they continue to be used in clinical practice. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and interferential therapy, short wave diathermy, laser therapy are all used by physiotherapists with the aim of providing pain relief. The interference effect uses two different medium-frequency alternating currents applied simultaneously through two electrodes to induce a current at the site of their interaction in the deep tissues. Transcutaneous nerve stimulation uses direct current pulses of adjustable frequency to stimulate the larger sensory nerve fibres selectively, and thereby to set up a gate control mechanism blocking the activity of the small fibres which conduct pain signals.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Ultrasound</h4>
                            <p>Ultrasound waves at approximately $10^{6} \mathrm{~Hz}$ can be projected as a beam from a transducer to induce a heating effect in deep tissues. They may also produce benefit from their mechanical and chemical effects on collagen and proteoglycans. Ultrasound is frequently used to reduce post-traumatic haematoma, oedema and adhesions of joints and their associated soft tissues.</p>

                            <p>There has been an increasing trend for patients to seek alternative therapy (i.e. chiropractic therapy, osteopathy, acupuncture, massage and homeopathy) to relieve musculoskeletal symptoms. However, no strong evidence has emerged over the last decade that suggests that alternative therapy is any more beneficial than physiotherapy.</p>

                                <li class="list-item">

                            </ol>
                            <p>The response depends upon the nature of the basic lesion: permanent relief is often gained in extra-articular lesions such as tennis elbow, but in arthritis the benefit is often no more than temporary, and repeated injections are seldom to be recommended.</p>

                            <p>Antibacterial agents are of immense importance in infective lesions, especially in acute osteomyelitis and acute pyogenic arthritis. To be successful treatment must be begun very early. These drugs are also of definite value in certain chronic infections, notably in tuberculosis.</p>
                            <p>Analgesics should be used as little as possible. Many orthopaedic disorders are prolonged for many weeks or months, and it is undesirable to prescribe any but the mildest analgesics continuously over long periods, except for incurable malignant disease.</p>
                            <p>Sedatives may be given if needed to promote sleep, but as with analgesics the rule should be to prescribe no more than is really necessary.</p>
                            <p>Anti-inflammatory drugs are those that damp down the excessive inflammatory response that may occur especially in rheumatoid arthritis and related disorders, by inhibiting the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes responsible for prostaglandin formation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are generally to be preferred - especially in the first instance - and they are a mainstay in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Many of these drugs also have an analgesic action. The powerful steroids cortisone, prednisolone, and their analogues should be used with extreme caution and indeed should be avoided altogether whenever possible, because through their side effects they may sometimes do more harm than good. Nevertheless there are times when their use may be justified - as for instance in acute exacerbations of rheumatoid arthritis, and especially in polymyalgia rheumatica and giant-cell arteritis (see p. 166).</p>
                            <p>Hormone-like drugs include the corticosteroids noted above, and sex hormones or analogues used for the prevention of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women and for the control of certain metastatic tumours such as hormone-dependent breast and prostatic tumours. These are being increasingly replaced by the bisphosphonates, a family of drugs which block the resorption of bone mineral.</p>
                            <p>Anti-osteoporosis drugs. Hormone replacement therapy and the SERMS (selective oestrogen receptor modulators) have largely been replaced by the bisphosphonates which block bone resorption and by anabolic agents such as parathyroid hormone and strontium.</p>
                            <p>Specific drugs work well in certain special diseases. Examples are vitamin C for scurvy, vitamin D for rickets and salicylates for the arthritis of rheumatic fever.</p>
                            <p>Cytotoxic drugs form the basis of chemotherapy for malignant tumours. These anti-cancer drugs include cyclophosphamide, melphalan, vincristine, doxorubicin, and methotrexate. They have serious side effects and are used only under expert supervision.</p>

                            <p>Treatment by manipulation is practised widely by orthopaedic surgeons and by others in allied professions. Strictly, the term might legitimately be used to include the passive movements, or 'mobilisations', that form part of the daily activities of a physiotherapy department and which have already been referred to above: but it is used here in a more restricted sense, to describe passive movements of joints, bones, or soft tissues carried out by the surgeon - with or without an anaesthetic, and often forcefully - as a deliberate step in treatment.</p>
                            <p>The subject will be considered under three general headings:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">

                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Manipulation for correction of deformity</h4>
                            <p>In this category manipulation has its most obvious application in the reduction of fractures and dislocations. It is also used to overcome deformity from contracted or short soft tissues - as, for example, in congenital club foot. Yet another simple example is the forcible subcutaneous rupture and dispersal of a ganglion over the dorsum of the wrist.</p>
                            <p>Technique. An anaesthetic may or may not be required, according to the nature of the condition that is being treated. In many instances - as in manipulation for a fracture or dislocation - the aim is to secure full reduction at the one sitting; but in resistant deformities such as club foot repeated manipulation may be required at intervals of a week or so, a little further improvement being gained each time.</p>
                            <p>Subsequent management. After manipulation for a deformity that is liable to recur - as in most cases of displaced fracture and in chronic deformities of joints - the limb is usually immobilised on a splint or in plaster to maintain the correction. In cases of resistant deformity gradual yielding of the soft tissue allows re-application of the splint in a more favourable position each time it is changed.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Manipulation for joint stiffness</h4>
                            <p>The type of case mainly concerned with here is that in which a joint shows serious limitation of movement after an acute injury - usually a fracture of a limb bone. 'Frozen' shoulder (periarthritis) in its non-active stage may also be included in this category. In such cases the stiffness is caused by adhesions either within the joint itself or, more often, in the soft tissues about or near the joint. Forcible manipulation by the surgeon is not required very often for stiffness of this type, because it will usually respond gradually to treatment by active exercises under the care of a physiotherapist, combined with increasing use of the limb.</p>
                            <p>The joint that is most amenable to manipulation is the knee. The shoulder and the joints of the foot may also respond. Manipulation of the elbow and of the joints of the hand may increase the stiffness and should not be attempted.</p>
                            <p>Technique. Muscular relaxation should be secured by anaesthesia, supplemented if necessary by a relaxant drug. Great force should not be used: it is better to gain slight improvement by moderate force and then to repeat the manipulation after an interval. Excessive force may fracture a bone; or it may cause fresh bleeding within the joint, thereby aggravating the stiffness.</p>
                            <p>Subsequent management. Manipulation for joint stiffness should always be followed by intensive active exercises designed to retain the increased range of movement.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Manipulation for relief of chronic pain</h4>
                            <p>In this third category of case treatment by manipulation is somewhat empirical, because in many instances it is impossible to determine precisely the nature of the underlying pathology, and consequently the way in which manipulation acts is a matter of conjecture and - it must be said - of misconception. Manipulation is used in such cases simply because previous experience has proved that it is often successful.</p>
                            <p>The painful conditions that respond best to manipulation are chronic strains, especially of the tarsal joints, the joints of the spinal column, and the sacro-iliac joints. A chronic strain may be the consequence of an acute injury that has not been followed by complete resolution, or it may be caused by long-continued mechanical overstrain. It is generally surmised that adhesions are present that prevent the extremes of joint movement (even though a restriction of movement may not be obvious clinically), that these adhesions are painful when stretched, and that the effect of manipulation is to rupture them. An alternative explanation that is advanced in certain cases is that there is a minor displacement of the joint surfaces or of an intra-articular structure (even though this can seldom be demonstrated radiologically), and that the effect of manipulation is to restore normal apposition.</p>
                            <p>Technique. Manipulation for relief of pain from chronic strain consists in putting the affected joint or joints forcibly through a full range of movement, usually while the patient is fully relaxed under an anaesthetic but sometimes without an anaesthetic. Steady longitudinal distraction of the joint is often a useful preliminary to the forcing of the extreme range.</p>
                            <p>Subsequent management. The manipulation should usually be followed by physiotherapy to maintain the function of the joint. It may be repeated after an interval if initial improvement does not progress to complete cure.</p>
                            <p>Dangers and safeguards in treatment by manipulation. Manipulation may do harm if it is undertaken for the stiffness of inflammatory arthritis in an active stage, or if a tumour or other destructive disease exists close to the joint. It is also inadvisable in cases of acute back pain due to prolapsed intervertebral disc, because it may cause further extrusion of disc material. This emphasises the importance of careful clinical and radiological examination - supplemented when necessary by other investigations such as determination of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, radioisotope scanning, radiculography or magnetic resonance imaging - before treatment is begun. It must be emphasised again that manipulation is of no value for stiffness of the metacarpo-phalangeal joints and interphalangeal joints of the hand.</p>
                            <p>During the manipulation itself care must be taken to avoid disasters such as the fracture of a bone or massive displacement of an intervertebral disc. It is well known that a fracture - especially of the patella or humerus, or even of the femur - may be caused easily by injudicious manipulations. This risk is greatly increased if the bone is already weak from the osteoporosis of disuse or from other rarefying disease.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Radiotherapy</h3>
                            <p>Radiotherapy - by X-rays or by the gamma rays of radio-active substances - may be used for certain benign conditions or for malignant disease. Because of its possible ill effects - particularly the risk of inducing malignant change - it should be advised only with caution for benign lesions, but its use may rarely be justified in the treatment of some cases of giant-cell tumour of bone that are unsuitable for local excision because of their anatomical site. In malignant disease radiotherapy is occasionally curative but more often palliative. In conditions such as malignant bone tumours, for which a tumour dose in the range of 5000-6000 centiGray may be required, only the penetrating rays produced by a super-voltage linear accelerator or by a radio-active cobalt unit should be used. With such apparatus a high dose can be delivered to the tumour with the least possible damage to the skin.</p>

                            <p>The chief essential of any operation is that it should not make the patient worse. This is so obvious that the statement may sound almost absurd. Yet it is unfortunately true that a disturbing number of operations carried out for orthopaedic conditions do in fact cause more harm than good for one reason or another. Hence the selection of cases for operation, the choice of the most appropriate operation in given circumstances, the technical performance of the operation, and the post-operative management are matters of the highest importance, and they call for a high degree of judgement and skill. Herein lies much of the fascination of orthopaedic surgery.</p>
                            <p>A detailed account of operative techniques is unnecessary here. All that is required is a brief mention of the more important operations.</p>

                            <p>Synovectomy is the operation for removal of the inflamed lining of a joint, while leaving the capsule intact. It may be of value in some types of chronic infective arthritis as well as occasionally in early rheumatoid arthritis. Because of the difficulty in gaining anatomical access, it is necessarily a subtotal procedure; but it may nevertheless afford worthwhile relief by reducing local pain and swelling. There is no clear evidence that it protects the articular cartilage from further damage; but the removal of a large part of this invasive granulation tissue or pannus may be of benefit by reducing the production of proteolytic enzymes.</p>

                            <p>Technique. If the bone is relatively soft (as in children) it may be divided simply with an osteotome or, in the case of a thin bone, by bone-cutting forceps. The strong cortex of the major long bones in an adult is not easily divided in that way because it tends to splinter; so most surgeons weaken the bone by making multiple drill holes before applying the osteotome, or, alternatively, they use a powered saw or a high-speed dental burr. When the bone has been divided and the necessary correction made it is often convenient to fix the fragments with a plate, nail-plate, or medullary nail: this may allow external splintage to be dispensed with. If internal fixation is not used the fragments may be immobilised by an external fixator; or they may be held in position by a suitable splint or plaster until union has occurred.</p>

                            <p>The operation of arthrodesis, or joint fusion, is used less commonly since the advent of reliable techniques of joint reconstruction, or arthroplasty, for the major limb joints. It has the advantage of providing a painless stable joint and the disability from a single stiff joint is usually slight, and patients readily adapt themselves to it. Even when two or three joints are fused function may be surprisingly good, depending upon the particular joints affected. This gives arthrodesis its most common application for treatment of arthritis in the small joints of the hands and feet but it is now rarely used for the hip, knee, or shoulder except as a salvage procedure.</p>

                            <p>Methods of arthrodesis. Arthrodesis may be intra-articular or extra-articular, or the two may be combined. In intra-articular arthrodesis the joint is opened and the bone ends are displayed. The articular cartilage (or what remains of it) is removed so that raw bone is exposed. The joint is placed in the desired position and immobilised, usually by metallic internal fixation as well as by a plaster-of-Paris splint, until clinical tests and radiographs show sound bony fusion. In some cases an external fixation device can be used with the addition of compression across the opposed bone surfaces which seems to speed union.</p>
                            <p>In extra-articular arthrodesis the joint itself is left undisturbed (though it may be immobilised by a nail or screw), but it is 'by-passed' by securing bone-to-bone fusion outside the joint, usually through the medium of a bone graft. The method is applicable mainly to the spine, shoulder, and hip. It has a theoretical advantage in cases of infective joint disease, because any risk of reactivating or disseminating the infection by opening the joint is avoided.</p>

                            <p>Position for arthrodesis. The best position for arthrodesis should not be regarded as rigidly established for each joint: variations may be appropriate and desirable in individual cases - for instance, to conform to the requirements of the patient's work. The following is only a general guide. Shoulder: $30^{\circ}$ of abduction and flexion, with $40^{\circ}$ of medial rotation. Elbow: If only one elbow is affected, $75^{\circ}$ of flexion from the fully extended position (or according to the requirements of the patient's work). If both elbows are affected, one should be in flexion $10^{\circ}$ above the right angle and the other about $20^{\circ}$ below the right angle. If forearm rotation is lost the most useful position of the forearm is in $10^{\circ}$ of pronation. Wrist: Extended $20^{\circ}$. Metacarpo-phalangeal joints: Flexed $35^{\circ}$. Interphalangeal joints: Semiflexed. Hip: About $15^{\circ}$ of flexion; no abduction or adduction. Knee: About $20^{\circ}$ of flexion. Ankle: In men, right angle; in women, $15-25^{\circ}$ of plantarflexion, according to accustomed height of heel. Metatarso-phalangeal joint of big toe: Slight extension, depending upon the accustomed height of shoe heel.</p>

                            <p>Arthroplasty is the operation for construction of a new movable joint. Its successful development in the last 30 years has resulted from the introduction of new biomaterials to replace articular surfaces and the surgical techniques to attach these to bone. Arthroplasty of the hip has revolutionised the treatment of arthritis in that joint and its use has now been extended to the knee, as well as the ankle, the shoulder, the elbow, certain joints in the hand, and the first metatarso-phalangeal joint in the foot.</p>
                            <p>Indications. The indications for arthroplasty vary with the particular joint affected and the degree of disability. Broadly, it has a use in the following conditions:</p>

                            <p>Each method has its merits, disadvantages and special applications.</p>
                            <p>Excision arthroplasty. In this method one or both of the articular ends of the bones are simply excised, so that a gap is created between them (Fig. 4.2) effectively creating a false joint or pseudarthrosis. The gap fills with fibrous tissue, or a pad of muscle or other soft tissue may be sewn in between the bones. By virtue of its flexibility the interposed tissue allows a reasonable range of movement, but the joint often lacks stability making it less suitable for the large weight-bearing joints of the lower limb. Excision arthroplasty is used most commonly at the metatarso-phalangeal joint of the big toe, in the treatment of hallux valgus and hallux rigidus (Keller's operation). It is also occasionally used at the hip, usually as a salvage operation after failed replacement arthroplasty. It is used occasionally at the elbow, the shoulder, and certain of the small joints of the hands and feet.</p>

                            <p>Hemi-arthroplasty (half-joint replacement arthroplasty). In a hemiarthroplasty only one of the articulating surfaces is removed and replaced by a prosthesis of similar shape (Fig. 4.3A). The prosthesis is usually made from metal. When appropriate, it may be fixed into the recipient bone with acrylic filling compound or 'bone cement'. The opposing, normal articulating surface is left undisturbed. The technique has its main application at the hip, where prosthetic replacement of the head and neck of the femur is commonly practised for femoral neck fracture in the elderly. The disadvantage is that any degeneration in the unreplaced articular surface will accelerate with recurrence of pain and loss of movement making it unsuitable for younger patients. It has rather a limited use elsewhere, examples being the replacement of the head of the radius after certain types of fracture, and replacement of the lunate bone in Kienböck's disease.</p>

(A) Half-joint replacement arthroplasty: the femoral head is replaced by a metal prosthesis. (B) Total replacement arthroplasty. The femoral head is replaced by a metal prosthesis and the acetabulum by a plastic socket. Both components may be held in place by acrylic filling compound or 'cement'. (C) Resurfacing (double cup) arthroplasty. Matching metal shells are used to resurface the femoral head and acetabular socket with cemented or cementless fixation.</figcaption>

                            <p>Total replacement arthroplasty. In this technique both of the opposed articulating surfaces are excised and replaced by prosthetic components (Fig. 4.3B). In the larger joints one of the components is usually of metal and the other of high-density polyethylene, and it is usual for both components to be held in place by acrylic 'bone cement'. In small joints such as the metacarpo-phalangeal joints a flexible one-piece prosthesis made from silicone rubber may be used.</p>
                            <p>Total replacement arthroplasty has proved very successful at the hip, and at the knee. It has been extended, so far with only moderate success, to many other joints including the shoulder, elbow, ankle, metacarpo-phalangeal joints, and metatarso-phalangeal joints. A disadvantage - which applies also to half-joint replacement arthroplasty - is that there is a tendency for the prosthesis to work loose after 10-15 years. This results from bone resorption around the implant due to an aseptic inflammatory reaction triggered by the production of microscopic wear particles from the artificial materials used for the articulating surfaces. In turn this has led to a search for harder materials and improved prosthetic designs to minimise the production of wear particles.</p>
                            <p>Another approach to preserve bone in younger patients, who might require later revision surgery, is to resurface rather than replace the joint. Attempts have been made to achieve this biologically with autogenous chondrocytes in the knee, or with artificial materials as in the double cup arthroplasty of the hip (Fig. 4.3C). The longer-term results from these new techniques remain uncertain and it should be noted that a conventional well-fitted replacement joint may give good service for as long as 15-20 years, especially in the case of the hip or knee.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Bone grafting operations</h3>
                            <p>Bone grafts are usually obtained from another part of the patient's body (autogenous grafts or autografts). If it is impracticable or undesirable to take bone from the patient's own body, grafts from another human subject may be used (allografts, homogenous grafts or homografts). These must be stored frozen under aseptic conditions until they have been proved to be free from transmissible infection, including HIV and other dangerous viral infections. For bone from living donors (mainly femoral heads removed during hip replacement operations) this necessitates retesting after 9 months to ensure that the donor was not incubating infectious disease at the time of removal of the bone. Cadaveric bone sterilised by irradiation is sometimes used and is increasingly available from large tissue banks. Grafts obtained from animals (xenografts, heterogenous grafts or heterografts) may be applicable if they are specially treated to reduce their antigenic properties. At some centres limited use is still made of such bone (chiefly bovine) prepared commercially in sterile packs, but it has been shown to be far inferior to the patient's own bone and cannot be relied upon to become incorporated with the host bone.</p>
                            <p>Bone transferred as a free autograft from one site to another does not survive wholly in a living state. For the most part the bone cells die, although a proportion may possibly survive, especially in cancellous bone. The purpose of the graft - as of allografts and heterografts - is mainly to serve as a scaffolding or temporary bridge upon which new bone is laid down. It also provides an osteogenic stimulus to the host cells from the bone morphogenic proteins released from the non-cellular bone matrix. Thus the whole of a graft is eventually replaced by new living bone. This process of replacement is dependent upon adequate revascularisation of the graft; so a graft that lies in a highly vascular bed is more likely to succeed than one that is surrounded by relatively ischaemic tissue.</p>
                            <p>With refinements in the technique of microvascular surgery it is now possible to transfer bone with its soft-tissue coverings on a vascular pedicle to a distant recipient site, with immediate anastomosis of its nutrient vessels to those in the new bed. Such living grafts are found to become incorporated rapidly. Vascularised grafts are especially valuable in major reconstructive procedures after extensive loss of bone and soft tissue.</p>
                            <p>Indications. Bone grafts are used mainly in three types of case:</p>

                            <p>Strut grafts. A strut graft is usually obtained from strong cortical bone: the subcutaneous part of the tibia is a common site. The graft is fixed to the recipient bone either by internal fixation or by inlaying. Such a graft serves as an internal splint as well as providing a framework for the growth of new bone (Fig. 4.4A).</p>

                            <p>Strip grafts. Sliver or strip grafts are generally obtained from spongy cancellous bone - especially from the crest of the ilium. They are used commonly for ununited fractures. They are laid about the fracture, deep to the periosteum, and are held in place by suture of the soft tissues over them.</p>
                            <p>Chip grafts. These also are preferably obtained from cancellous bone. They serve the same purposes as sliver grafts but are smaller pieces of bone. The chips are packed firmly into, or around, the recipient bone and are held in place simply by suture of the soft tissues over them (Fig. 4.4B).</p>
                            <p>Vascularised grafts. These require a suitable donor site, such as the fibula, rib, or iliac crest, together with a meticulous microscopic technique to secure the necessary re-anastomosis of the nutrient vessels at the new site (Fig. 4.4C). The method is only suitable for use in specialised centres with the necessary equipment and expertise.</p>

                            <p>In the operation of tendon transfer, or tendon transplant, the insertion of a healthy functioning muscle is moved to a new site, so that the muscle henceforth has a different action. In this way the lost function of a paralysed or severed muscle can be taken over by one that is intact. In properly selected cases there need be no noticeable loss of power in the former sphere of action of the transferred muscle, because there is often considerable duplication or overlap in the function of individual muscles. Thus a tendon of flexor digitorum superficialis may be transferred to a new site without appreciably impairing the power of finger flexion, which can be adequately controlled by the flexor profundus. Similarly the extensor indicis can be spared for a new function without seriously interfering with the power of extension of the index finger (Fig. 4.5).</p>

                            <p>Technique. The tendon to be transferred is divided at an appropriate point, re-routed in the direction of its new action, and secured to its new insertion. If it is to be inserted into bone it is passed through a drill hole and held by suturing back on itself or by suturing to the periosteum or soft tissues on the deep aspect of the bone. If it is to be united to a tendon stump the junction may be secured by end-to-end suture or, preferably, by interlacing the tendons one through the other and transfixing them with mattress sutures.</p>
                            <p>Examples. 1. In a case of paralysis of the radial nerve, with loss of active extension of the wrist, fingers, and thumb, function may be restored by the following tendon transfers: pronator teres is transferred to extensor carpi radialis brevis; flexor carpi ulnaris is transferred to extensor digitorum and extensor pollicis longus; and palmaris longus is transferred to abductor pollicis longus. 2. In a case of congenital talipes equino-varus (p. 434) transfer of the tendon of the tibialis anterior or tibialis posterior to the outer side of the foot will help to prevent recurrence of the deformity. 3. In a case of rupture of the extensor pollicis longus, with extensive fraying of the tendon, direct repair may be impracticable. Function may be restored by transfer of the extensor indicis to the extensor pollicis longus (Fig. 4.5).</p>

                            <p>Leg lengthening is suitable mainly for children. It is achieved by dividing the appropriate bone (usually the tibia, sometimes the femur) and then gradually elongating the limb in a special screw-distraction apparatus at the rate of about 2 mm a day. A maximum of about 5 cm may be gained. The procedure is time-consuming and trying for the patient, and should be reserved for carefully selected cases in which the discrepancy in length is marked. A more recent innovation is the technique of bone transport, in which a length of the diaphysis is moved slowly downwards to fill a gap, while new bone forms to fill in the space created by its advancement (Fig. 4.6). These techniques have been facilitated by the introduction of the ring frame distraction apparatus of Ilizarov, which allows correction of angulation as well as lengthening (Fig. 4.7).</p>
                            <p>Leg shortening, by removing an appropriate length from the shaft of the longer femur or tibia, is less hazardous but not to be undertaken lightly because it disturbs a limb that was previously normal. In a patient who is fairly tall, and especially in adults, it is often preferable to leg lengthening.</p>
                            <p>Arrest of epiphysial growth (on the longer side) is applicable only to children with considerable growth still to come. It entails either destruction, or bridging by bone grafts or by metal staples, of the lower femoral epiphysis or of the upper tibial epiphysis, or both. The correction to be expected depends upon the amount of growth still to come from the corresponding epiphysis of the opposite (shorter) leg, which depends in turn upon the patient's age at the time of operation, and upon the nature of the abnormality that is responsible for the shortening.</p>

                            <p>Relatively recently, the principle of tissue distraction was described by Ilizarov. This states that if a tissue is very gradually pulled apart it responds by creating new tissue. The principle was initially described for bone, where it was shown that if a bone was divided and following a delay period of $3-10$ days, was pulled apart at approximately $1 \mathrm{~mm} /$ day, the body responded by creating a column of callus, which eventually would consolidate into healthy new bone.</p>
                            <p>This process is now used extensively in limb lengthening, bone transport and the correction of deformity. In the latter case, the bone is gradually straightened and rotated to the desired position. In bone transport, the same process is used to fill a bone defect (which may have arisen as a result of trauma or from the treatment of bone infection or tumours), the bone is divided through a healthy area and a segment of bone is pulled through the defect in order to create a column of new bone which fills the defect (Fig. 4.6).</p>
                            <p>The same principle can be used to create soft tissues such as muscle, nerve, tendon and skin during the gradual correction of contractures of joints.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Bone fixation techniques</h3>
                            <p>The same modalities of bone stabilisation that are used during fracture treatment are used for reconstructive surgery. Osteotomies are often stabilised with casts in children, but in adults are more commonly stabilised with plates, intramedullary nails, or external fixation. During the arthrodesis of joints, both internal and external fixation methods are used. Limb lengthening is usually carried out with specific external fixators, but more recently internal lengthening nails have been developed which are applicable for some patients.</p>
                            <p>External fixation frames consist of a frame that lies external to the skin, which is connected to the bone via 'half pins' or fine wires that pass from the frame through the skin and into the bone. The half pins are relatively broad ($4-6 \mathrm{~mm}$) and pass from the external frame through the soft tissues on one side of the limb and finally through both cortices of the bone. Fine wires $(1.5-2 \mathrm{~mm})$ are used with circular external fixators and completely transfix the limb, going through both cortices of the bone and the soft tissues on each side of the limb. The fine wires are placed under tension and then clamped to the circular external frame. During lengthening and the correction of deformity, fine adjustments are made to the connecting struts on the external frame which bring about the desired amount of lengthening or deformity correction.</p>

                            <p>Amputation can be a useful treatment option. It may be necessary for malignant tumours for which it is not possible to perform a limb salvage procedure. In certain patients with congenital conditions, such as pseudarthrosis, a below-knee amputation may be the best treatment. Most commonly, amputations are carried out for peripheral vascular disease, infection or trauma.</p>
                            <p>With improvements in the design and manufacture of modern prosthetic limbs, the function after below-knee amputation is usually extremely good (Fig. 4.8). However after above-knee amputation, walking is more difficult and requires approximately a third more energy than normal. Function after upper limb amputation is also far less good, and upper limb amputation should be avoided if at all possible. As many as $80 \%$ of patients may experience 'phantom limb' sensation after amputation, that is they feel a limb that is no longer there and this may be accompanied by persistent pain.</p>
                            <p>Common levels for amputation are through the mid-foot (Chopart, Lisfranc), distal tibia (Syme's, Pyrogroff), proximal tibia (below-knee amputation), distal femur (above-knee amputation). The aim is to provide a soundly healed end bearing stump with good muscle control and this should not be compromised in order to maintain length.</p>
