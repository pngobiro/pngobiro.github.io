                        <p>The knee depends for its stability upon its four main ligaments and upon the quadriceps muscle. The importance of the quadriceps cannot be overemphasised. So efficiently can a powerful quadriceps control the knee that it can maintain stability despite considerable laxity of the ligaments. In many injuries and diseases of the knee the quadriceps wastes strikingly, and to some extent the condition of the muscle is an index of the state of the knee: if it is wasted it is probable that there is a significant abnormality within the joint.</p>
                        <p>Apart from its vulnerability to injury, the knee is also particularly prone to almost every kind of arthritis. Moreover, it is the joint most commonly affected by osteochondritis dissecans and intra-articular loose body formation.</p>
                        <p>The region of the knee is the zone of most active bone growth in the lower limb (contrast the upper limb, where most growth occurs towards the shoulder and the wrist rather than towards the elbow). Perhaps partly for this reason the metaphyses near the knee are common sites of osteomyelitis and of primary malignant bone tumours.</p>
                        <p>In the diagnosis of knee complaints arthroscopy has secured for itself a role in investigation for any suspected intra-articular lesion although MRI has usurped this position. Arthroscopic techniques of surgery have become routine for such common disorders as meniscal tears and intra-articular loose bodies.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">History</h3>
                            <p>The history is of particular importance in the diagnosis of disorders of the knee. In a case of torn meniscus, for instance, the clinical diagnosis sometimes depends upon the history alone. When there has been a previous injury to the knee, the exact sequence of events at the time of the injury and afterwards must be ascertained. Enquiry is made into the mechanism of the injury; what the patient was doing at the time; whether he was able to carry on afterwards. Was he able to finish the game? If not, was he carried from the field or was he able to walk? How soon after the injury did the knee swell? Was he able to straighten the knee fully? If not, how did he eventually get it straight? Was he able to bend it?</p>
                            <p>Caution is necessary in accepting the patient's story of 'locking' at its face value. Many patients speak of 'locking' when the knee simply feels stiff and painful, or when it causes momentary jabs of pain on movement. Locking from a torn meniscus means simply that the knee cannot be straightened fully; it can usually be flexed freely. In locking from a loose body within the joint the knee may be jammed so that it will neither flex nor extend, but this is rather uncommon and the knee usually unlocks itself after an interval, or can be freed by judicious manoeuvring.</p>

                            <p>For proper examination the whole length of the limb must be uncovered. It is impossible to examine a knee adequately when the thigh is half covered by tightly rolled trousers or underpants. The sound knee must also be exposed for comparison. For proper examination of the knee the patient must always be recumbent upon a couch.</p>

                            <p>The knee exemplifies better than any other joint the different types of diffuse articular swelling. That the joint is in fact swollen should be obvious from inspection: comparison of the two knees will show that the concavities present at each side of the patella have been filled out on the affected side.</p>
                            <p>A diffuse swelling of the knee can arise only from three fundamental causes:</p>

                                    <span class="list-content">thickening of the synovial membrane (in practice it is found that this is the only soft tissue about the knee that swells appreciably).</span>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Determination of the particular cause or combination of causes in a given case depends entirely on careful palpation, as follows:</p>
                            <p><strong>Thickening of bone.</strong> Thickening of bone is detected without difficulty by deep palpation if the affected side is compared with the normal. There may be a general enlargement, caused perhaps by a bone infection or by an expanding tumour or cyst; or there may be simply a local prominence, caused usually by osteophytes at the joint margin or by an exostosis.</p>
                            <p><strong>Fluid within the joint.</strong> A fluid effusion is best detected by the fluctuation test. The palm of one hand is placed upon the thigh immediately above the patella - that is, over the suprapatellar pouch. The other hand is placed over the front of the joint, with the thumb and index finger just beyond the margins of the patella (Fig. 18.1A). Pressure of the upper hand upon the suprapatellar pouch drives fluid from the pouch into the main joint cavity, where it bulges the capsule at each side of the patella and imparts an easily detectable hydraulic impulse to the finger and thumb of the lower hand (Fig. 18.1B). Conversely, by pressure of this finger and thumb the fluid can be driven back into the suprapatellar pouch, the hydraulic impulse being clearly received by the upper hand. In this way an unmistakable sense of fluctuation can be elicited between the two hands. The 'patellar tap' test (Fig. 18.1C), in which the patella is tapped backwards sharply so that it strikes the femur and rebounds, though still used, is less reliable.</p>
                            <p>Distinction between effusions of blood, serous fluid, and pus is made partly from the history, partly from the clinical examination. An effusion of blood (haemarthrosis) appears within an hour or two of an injury and rapidly becomes tense and therefore painful. An effusion of clear fluid develops slowly (12-24 hours) and is never as tense as an effusion of blood. An effusion of pus is associated with general illness and pyrexia.</p>

                            <p><strong>Thickening of synovial membrane.</strong> A thickened synovial membrane is always a prominent feature of chronic inflammatory arthritis. The thickening is often most obvious above the patella, where the reduplicated membrane forms the suprapatellar pouch. It has a characteristic boggy feel on palpation, rather as if a sheet of warm sponge-rubber had been placed between the skin and the underlying bone. It is worth emphasising that since it is highly vascular, a thickened synovial membrane is always associated with increased warmth of the overlying skin.</p>

                            <p>Accurate assessment of the range of movement is particularly important in the knee, because even a slight impairment of movement is significant. It is important to note also whether movement is painful and whether it is accompanied by crepitation.</p>
                            <p><strong>Flexion.</strong> The normal range varies with the build of the patient. Thin patients can flex more than fat patients - usually enough to bring the heel in contact with the buttock. The range of the sound knee should always be taken as the normal for the individual.</p>
                            <p><strong>Extension.</strong> There is a fairly wide variation in the normal range of extension: it is wrong to accept $0^{\circ}$ as the starting-point of movement ($0^{\circ}=$ the anatomical position, with the knee straight). Many normal women can hyperextend their knees whereas some normal men cannot extend quite to the straight position. It is important to detect even a slight impairment of knee extension: therefore the range on the sound side must be taken as the yardstick of normal extension and a very careful comparison must be made between the two sides.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Tests for stability</h3>
                            <p>The integrity of each of the four major ligaments is tested in turn.
                            <strong>Testing the medial and lateral ligaments.</strong> For this test the joint must be in a position just short of full extension, so that the posterior part of the joint capsule is relaxed. Technique: Support the limb by a hand gripping the ankle region and by the other hand behind the knee, flexing it slightly. Instruct the patient to relax the muscles. Using the more proximal hand as a fulcrum on the appropriate side of the knee, apply first an abduction force to test the medial ligament (Fig. 18.2A) and then an adduction force to test the lateral ligament.</p>
                            <p><strong>Testing the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments.</strong> The anterior cruciate ligament prevents anterior glide of the tibia on the femur; the posterior cruciate ligament prevents posterior glide. First the ligaments are tested with the knee flexed $90^{\circ}$. Technique: The patient's knee being flexed to a right angle and the foot placed firmly on the couch, sit lightly on the foot to prevent it from sliding (Fig. 18.2B). With the interlocked fingers of the two hands form a sling behind the upper end of the tibia, and clasp the sides of the leg between the thenar eminences. Alternately pull and push the upper end of the tibia to determine the amount of antero-posterior movement. Normally there is an antero-posterior glide of up to half a centimetre.</p>

                            <p>In a second test the ligaments are examined with the knee flexed only $15^{\circ}$ or $20^{\circ}$ (Lachman test). One hand supports the thigh just above the knee, gripping the femoral condyles, while the other hand grasps the upper end of the tibia (Fig. 18.3). While the patient relaxes the muscles the extent of any anterior or posterior glide of the tibial condyles upon the femur is determined by push-and-pull movements of the tibia.</p>

                            <p><strong>Lateral pivot shift.</strong> The test for lateral pivot shift is supplementary to the tests described above for deficiency of the anterior cruciate ligament. The test depends on the fact that when the anterior cruciate ligament and the lateral ligament are deficient or lax the pivot between the lateral condyle of the femur and that of the tibia may be unstable.</p>
                            <p><em>Technique.</em> The leg on the affected side is lifted by the examiner's corresponding hand so that the knee drops into full extension with the muscles relaxed. The limb is supported under the arm, and with the other hand the examiner then presses against the outer aspect of the limb just below the knee, imparting a valgus strain (Fig. 18.4). At the same time the tibia is rotated medially upon the femur. The knee is now flexed slowly from the straight position. If the test is positive the lateral tibial condyle becomes spontaneously relocated on the femoral condyle when the knee reaches $30^{\circ}$ or $35^{\circ}$ of flexion. The relocation is evidenced by a visible or palpable jerk (hence the term 'jerk test' sometimes used for the manoeuvre).</p>

                            <p>In most cases symptoms felt in the knee have their origin locally in or near the joint; but there are exceptions that may trap the unwary. Most importantly, pain in the knee may be the predominant feature of a disorder of the hip, such as arthritis or slipped upper femoral epiphysis. Less commonly sciatic pain, perhaps from a prolapsed intervertebral disc, has its greatest intensity at the level of the knee. In the investigation of pain in the knee we must therefore recognise the possibility that it may be referred from the spine or hip, and extend the examination to those regions if a satisfactory explanation for the trouble is not found on local examination.</p>

                            <p><strong>Radiographic examination.</strong> In a straightforward case antero-posterior and lateral films are sufficient. Tangential projections of the femoral condyles with the knee flexed are sometimes helpful, especially when osteochondritis dissecans is suspected. Tangential ('sky-line') views of the patella may also be required.</p>
                            <p><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging.</strong> When adequate information cannot be obtained from plain radiography, magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful as a non-invasive alternative to arthroscopy.</p>
                            <p><strong>Arthroscopy.</strong> Arthroscopy can be a useful adjunct to clinical and radiographic examination in the diagnosis of knee complaints (Fig. 18.5). Its use for diagnostic purposes has been largely replaced by MRI, but it is a well-established method of treating a number of intra-articular disorders by minimally invasive operation.</p>
                            <p>Arthroscopy is usually carried out with the patient anaesthetised, the joint cavity is filled with saline through a hollow needle, and a cannula and telescope are entered at the appropriate site. By correctly manoeuvring and rotating the arthroscope, and if necessary by the use of alternative sites of entry, almost the whole extent of the interior of the joint can be brought into view with the possible exception of the postero-lateral recess.</p>

                            <p>The femur is one of the commonest sites of the important bone tumours.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Benign tumours (General description of benign bone tumours, p. 106)</h4>
                            <p>Of the four main types of benign bone tumour - osteoid osteoma, chondroma, osteochondroma, and giant-cell tumour - only the giant-cell tumour requires further consideration here, because of the special treatment requirements when it occurs close to the knee.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Giant-cell tumour (osteoclastoma)</h4>
                            <p>The lower end of the femur is a particularly frequent site for this uncommon tumour. The upper end of the femur is affected much less often. The tumour usually arises in young adults. It begins in what was the metaphysial region, but since the epiphysis is fused there is no obstacle to its spread into the articular end of the bone. The bone is gradually expanded, the cortex becoming very thin and pathological fracture may sometimes occur.</p>
                            <p>Treatment. Thorough curettage of the tumour and filling of the resultant cavity with bone grafts or acrylic bone cement has been widely used but it is attended by a high incidence of recurrence. If the tumour is large many surgeons now prefer to excise the tumour-bearing lower end of the femur and to fit a custom-made metal prosthesis to replace the lower end of the femur and the knee joint.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Malignant tumours (General description of malignant bone tumours, p. 112)</h4>
                            <p>The femur is a common site for all of the main types of malignant bone tumour occurring in younger patients. Three require mention - namely osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma. However, it should be remembered that metastatic tumours are much more common than any of the primary malignant tumours, particularly in patients over the age of 50.</p>
                            <p><strong>Osteosarcoma (osteogenic sarcoma).</strong> This is usually a tumour of childhood or early adult life: when it occurs in patients beyond middle age it is usually a complication of Paget's disease. Typically it arises in the metaphysis of a long bone, and the lower metaphysis of the femur is the favourite site. The tumour is highly malignant, with a mortality still in the region of $40 \%$ or more despite recent advances in treatment. Treatment is discussed on page 117.</p>
                            <p><strong>Ewing's tumour.</strong> This also occurs mainly in children or adolescents. Unlike most bone tumours, it usually affects the shaft of the bone, which it expands in a fusiform manner. Over it, layer upon layer of new bone is laid down, giving a typical 'onion-peel' appearance as seen in the radiographs. Treatment is discussed on page 121.</p>
                            <p><strong>Chondrosarcoma.</strong> This tumour occurs more commonly in middle age and elderly patients suggesting that it represents a malignant change in a pre-existing chondroma. Clinically it presents with local pain and swelling and may reach a large size because of slow growth. Imaging shows an expanding lytic lesion with characteristic patchy calcification and cortical destruction. Treatment is entirely surgical since no chemotherapy is effective on the relatively avascular tumour.</p>
                            
                            <h4 class="card-subtitle-small">Metastatic (secondary) tumours</h4>
                            <p>The femur is commonly invaded by metastatic tumours, especially in its proximal half (Fig. 18.6).</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> The tumours that metastasise most readily to bone are carcinomas of the lung, breast, prostate, kidney, and thyroid. The bone structure is usually destroyed by the tumour and pathological fracture is common (Fig. 18.6A).</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> The principles of treatment of metastatic tumours in bone were described on page 126. Most pathological fractures of the femur lend themselves well to internal fixation with a long modified intramedullary nail, though sometimes this requires the addition of acrylic bone cement to achieve stability (Fig. 18.6B).</p>

                            <p>Pyogenic arthritis is commoner in the knee than in most other joints, partly because the knee is so exposed to injury and partly because of the close relationship of the joint cavity to the lower metaphysis of the femur, which is one of the commonest sites of acute osteomyelitis. The onset is acute or subacute, with pain, swelling, and loss of function. Radiographs do not show any abnormality in the early stages.</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> Appropriate antibiotic therapy must be started immediately (see p. 98). Local treatment: The joint is rested in a plaster splint in a position of $20^{\circ}$ of flexion. The purulent effusion is removed daily by aspiration so long as it re-forms or by arthrotomy. Rest is continued until the infection has been overcome; thereafter active movements are encouraged.</p>

                            <p>After the hip, the knee is the limb joint most often affected by tuberculosis, usually in children or young adults. The knee is painful, diffusely swollen from thickening of the synovial membrane, and warm. Movements are restricted, the thigh muscles are wasted, and an abscess or sinus is sometimes apparent.</p>
                            <p><strong>Radiographic features.</strong> The earliest change is diffuse rarefaction throughout the area of the knee (Fig. 18.7). Later, unless the disease is arrested, there is narrowing of the cartilage space and erosion of the underlying bone.</p>

                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> Constitutional treatment, by antituberculous drugs, is the same as that for other tuberculous joints (p. 102). Local treatment is at first by rest in a splint or plaster, generally for two to three months in the first instance. Subsequent management depends upon the response to treatment. If the disease is still active and articular cartilage or bone has been destroyed, sound bony fusion should usually be the ultimate aim. Immobilisation is therefore continued until the disease becomes quiescent. Arthrodesis may then be undertaken, provided the growth epiphyses have closed.</p>

                            <p>The knees are among the joints most frequently affected by rheumatoid arthritis, and they often suffer severe permanent disability. Both knees are often affected simultaneously with several other joints.</p>
                            <p>The knees are painful, swollen from synovial thickening, and warm to the touch. Bow-leg, knock-knee, or flexion deformity may occur. Movement is impaired, and painful if forced.</p>
                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> Radiographs do not show any abnormality at first. Later there is diffuse rarefaction of the bone in the area of the joint. In long-established cases destruction of articular cartilage leads to narrowing of the joint space (Fig. 18.8), and there may be clear-cut erosions of bone, characteristically at the articular margins. Radioisotope bone scanning shows increased uptake of isotope in the region of the joint.</p>

                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> In the active stage the treatment is that for rheumatoid arthritis in general (p. 137). Local treatment for the knees depends upon the severity of the inflammatory reaction. If it is severe, rest in bed or even temporary immobilisation with moulded plaster or polythene splints is advisable. Physical treatment is worth a trial. The most effective methods are exercises to preserve muscle power and joint movement, and local heat in the form of short-wave diathermy. Injections of hydrocortisone into the joint have sometimes given relief.</p>
                            <p><strong>Operative treatment.</strong> Three types of operation may be employed in treating more advanced stages of joint disease: 1. synovectomy, 2. replacement arthroplasty, 3. arthrodesis.</p>
                            <p><em>Synovectomy.</em> When there is persistent boggy thickening of the synovial membrane, but the articular cartilage is well preserved, the operation of synovectomy (excision of the synovial membrane) is worth considering. This operation alone has no place in the later stages of the disease.</p>
                            <p><em>Replacement arthroplasty.</em> Replacement arthroplasty of the knee now gives as good results as have been achieved at the hip. Excellent and durable results are now being achieved in over 90 per cent of patients after ten years. Several techniques of knee arthroplasty are available: all of them rely upon replacement of the articular surfaces by a metal or plastic (polyethylene) prosthesis. The present trend is to provide gliding articular surfaces rather than a pivoted hinge (total condylar replacement, Fig. 18.9A). In unicompartmental arthritis, the medial or the lateral femoral condyle may be replaced alone (Fig. 18.9B), but this is only suitable for osteoarthritis.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE KNEE (General description of osteoarthritis, p. 140)</h3>
                            <p>The knee is affected by osteoarthritis more often than any other joint. The condition is particularly common in elderly, obese women.</p>
                            <p><strong>Cause.</strong> It is caused by a degeneration of the articular cartilage of uncertain aetiology; but nearly always some factor is present that has caused the joint to wear out sooner than usual. Obesity is the commonest factor. Other important predisposing factors are: previous fracture causing irregularity of the joint surfaces; previous disease with damage to articular cartilage (especially old rheumatoid arthritis or infective arthritis); previous intra-articular mechanical damage, as from a torn meniscus or from osteochondritis dissecans; and mal-alignment of the tibia on the femur (as in long-established bow-leg or knock-knee deformity from any cause).</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> The articular cartilage is worn away and the underlying bone becomes thickened and eburnated. There is hypertrophy of bone at the joint margins, with the formation of marginal osteophytes.</p>
                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> There is slowly increasing aching pain in the joint, worse after unusual activity, and 'grating' may be felt or heard on movement. The symptoms are often exacerbated by a slight strain or twist. On examination the knee is slightly thickened from hypertrophy of bone at the joint margins. Movement is moderately restricted and is accompanied by coarse crepitation. The quadriceps muscle is wasted. In severe cases there is a tendency to varus (bow-leg) deformity, less often a valgus (knock-knee) deformity.</p>
                            <p><strong>Radiographic features.</strong> An earlier sign in many cases is sharpening or 'spiking' of the joint margins, especially of the patella (Fig. 18.11) and tibia. Later, narrowing of the cartilage space is obvious, osteophytes form at the joint margins, and the subchondral bone may become sclerotic (Fig. 18.12).</p>

                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> In the usual case of moderate severity, conservative treatment is often successful in relieving the symptoms. The most effective method is by physiotherapy, specifically intensive active exercises to strengthen the wasted quadriceps muscle. Intra-articular injections of hydrocortisone are not recommended in general.</p>
                            <p><strong>Operative treatment.</strong> In advanced arthritis, with severe persistent pain, especially when associated with deformity and stiffness, operation may be advisable. The following are the operations most used:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>arthroscopic washout</li>
                                <li>removal of loose bodies</li>
                                <li>upper tibial osteotomy</li>
                                <li>excision of patella</li>
                                <li>arthroplasty</li>
                                <li>arthrodesis.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p><em>Upper tibial osteotomy.</em> Tibial osteotomy aims to relieve pain and to correct deformity. It is especially valuable when wear of articular cartilage and bone has affected one half of the tibio-femoral joint more than the other. Commonly the medial half of the joint is markedly narrowed whereas the lateral compartment remains relatively healthy. Correction of the mal-alignment by removal of a wedge of bone based laterally (Fig. 18.13B) transfers the weight-bearing thrust towards the more healthy lateral compartment.</p>

                            <p>Haemophilic arthritis affects the knee more often than any other joint. As in other joints, the main feature is intra-articular haemorrhage, often recurrent, with consequent irritation and, later, degeneration of the joint.</p>

If antihaemophilic factor is not available the outlook for the future of the knee is much less favourable. Aspiration should usually be avoided. Instead, the knee should be bandaged and immobilised on a Thomas's splint or in a plaster backslab.</p>

                            <p>Neuropathic arthritis (Charcot's osteoarthropathy) of the knee is now seen very seldom in Britain because of the rarity of tabes dorsalis.

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">ANTERIOR KNEE PAIN (Including chondromalacia of the patella)</h3>
                            <p>Anterior knee pain is a generic term that almost certainly includes more than a single clinical entity. The clinical syndrome characteristically occurs in adolescents, especially girls, though it also affects athletes, particularly runners. The description that follows relates to one well-recognised type of lesion, namely chondromalacia of the patella.</p>
                            <p><strong>Chondromalacia of the patella.</strong> In this condition the cartilage of the articular surface of the patella - particularly the medial facet - is roughened and fibrillated for reasons that are unknown. It is surmised that friction between the damaged area and the corresponding femoral condyle is responsible for the pain.</p>
                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> The patient is often a girl aged 15-18 years. There is aching pain deep in the knee, behind the patella. Pain is exacerbated by climbing or descending stairs. Movements may be accompanied by fine crepitation transmitted to the examiner's hand upon the patella, especially when the patient does a 'knees bend' exercise from the standing position.</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> This should nearly always be non-operative. An elasticated bandage is applied and strenuous activities are curtailed. Physiotherapy consisting of strapping the patella medially and strengthening the vastus medialis muscle can be of benefit. Operative treatment should be avoided unless significant patello-femoral malalignment is present.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">TEARS OF THE MENISCI</h3>
                            <p>Injuries of the menisci (semilunar cartilages) are common in men under the age of 45. A tear is usually caused by a twisting force with the knee semiflexed or flexed. The medial meniscus is torn much more often than the lateral.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> There are three types of meniscus tear, but all begin as a longitudinal split (Fig. 18.15A). If the split extends throughout the length of the meniscus it becomes a <strong>bucket-handle tear</strong>, in which the fragments remain attached at both ends (Fig. 18.16A). This is much the commonest type. The 'bucket handle' (that is, the central fragment) is displaced towards the middle of the joint, so that the condyle of the femur rolls upon the tibia through the rent in the meniscus. This limits full extension ($=$ 'locking').</p>

                            <p>If the initial longitudinal tear emerges at the concave border of the meniscus a pedunculated tag is formed. In <strong>posterior horn tear</strong> the fragment remains attached at its posterior horn (Fig. 18.16B); in <strong>anterior horn tear</strong> it remains attached at its anterior horn (Fig. 18.16C).</p>
                            <p><strong>Clinical features of torn medial meniscus.</strong> The history is characteristic, especially with 'bucket-handle' tears. In consequence of a twisting injury the patient falls and has pain at the antero-medial aspect of the joint. He is unable to straighten the knee fully. The next day he notices swelling of the whole knee. He rests the knee. After about 2 weeks the swelling lessens, the knee seems to go straight, and he resumes his activities. Within weeks or months the knee suddenly gives way again during a twisting movement.</p>
                            <p><em>Locking.</em> By 'locking' is meant inability to extend the knee fully. It is not a true jamming of the joint because there is a free range of flexion.</p>
                            <p><strong>Clinical features of torn lateral meniscus.</strong> The features are broadly similar, but the clinical picture is often less clearly defined. Pain is at the lateral rather than the medial side of the joint.</p>
                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> Plain radiographs are usually normal. MRI is reliable in demonstrating the various types of tear and is non-invasive (Fig. 18.17).</p>

                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> Once the diagnosis is established the standard treatment is to excise either the whole meniscus or, more appropriately in most cases, the displaced 'bucket-handle' fragment alone.

                            <p>A degenerate meniscus is liable to suffer a different type of lesion.

                            <p>Osteochondritis dissecans is characterised by local ischaemic necrosis of a segment of the articular surface of a bone and of the overlying articular cartilage, with eventual separation of the fragment to form an intra-articular loose body.

                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> The lesion nearly always affects the articular surface of the medial condyle of the femur (Fig. 18.22). Within the area of the lesion the subchondral bone is avascular and the overlying cartilage softens. A clear line of demarcation forms between the avascular segment and the surrounding normal bone and cartilage (Fig. 18.22A). After many months the fragment separates as a loose body (sometimes two or three), leaving a shallow cavity in the articular surface which is ultimately filled with fibrocartilage (Fig. 18.22B&amp;C).</p>

                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> In the developing stage treatment should be expectant: the knee is supported with a crepe bandage and strenuous activities are curtailed. When the lesion shows a clear line of demarcation between the separating fragment and the surrounding normal bone - the loose piece should usually be removed, especially if it is small. This may be done arthroscopically.</p>

                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> The characteristic symptom of a loose body in the knee is recurrent locking of the joint from interposition of the loose piece between the joint surfaces. Suddenly, without warning, the knee becomes jammed during movement. Locking is accompanied by severe pain. After a variable interval the patient is usually able, by manoeuvring the limb, to disengage the loose body and free the joint.</p>

                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> In general the treatment for an intra-articular loose body is to remove it, when possible by an arthroscopic technique. Removal should always be advised if the loose body is causing recurrent locking.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">RECURRENT DISLOCATION OF THE PATELLA</h3>
                            <p>The patello-femoral joint is one of the three joints that are most liable to recurrent displacement, the others being the shoulder and the ankle. In the case of the patello-femoral joint, unlike the other two, the instability is often caused by congenital factors rather than by an initial violent injury.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathological anatomy.</strong> In dislocations of the patella the displacement is always lateral, the patella slipping over the lateral condyle of the femur while the knee is flexed. Four factors, all of which may be inborn, predispose to recurrent dislocation: 1. general ligamentous laxity; 2. under-development of the lateral femoral condyle; 3. an abnormally high position of the patella (patella alta); 4. genu valgum.</p>
                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> Radiographs are seldom obtained in the state of dislocation. After reduction the knee may appear normal radiographically, but commonly the patella is small and is seen at a slightly higher level than usual, often in both knees ('patella alta'). MRI scans may be more informative and may demonstrate damage to the articular surface of the patella and any defects or tears in the medial soft-tissue structures (Fig. 18.26).</p>

                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> If the dislocations recur with such frequency that the patient is seriously disabled, operation should be advised. The method often recommended is to detach the bony insertion of the patellar tendon and transpose it to a new bed in the tibia, medial and distal to the original insertion (Fig. 18.27).</p>

                            <p>It is important to distinguish between recurrent dislocation of the patella and habitual dislocation. In habitual dislocation the patella dislocates laterally <em>each time</em> the knee is flexed beyond a certain range. This condition becomes apparent at an earlier age than recurrent dislocation - usually in early childhood. Treatment is by division of the tight muscle or band (usually vastus lateralis) so far as is necessary to allow full flexion of the knee without displacement of the patella.</p>

                            <p>The knee and leg are bowed outwards (Fig. 18.28A). A mild degree of this deformity is so common as to be almost normal in children aged 1 to 3 years. It does not require treatment unless it persists into later childhood.</p>

                            <p>The knee is angled inwards, the tibia being abducted in relation to the femur. With the knees straight, the medial malleoli cannot be brought into contact (Fig. 18.28B). The 'knock-knee' deformity is common in children aged 3 to 5 years. In the absence of underlying bone disease it usually corrects itself spontaneously in the course of years.</p>

                            <p>The bursa that lies in front of the lower half of the patella and the upper part of the patellar tendon is prone to inflammation.</p>
                            <p><strong>Types.</strong> There are two types: 1. irritative; 2. infective or suppurative.</p>
                            <p><em>Irritative prepatellar bursitis.</em> This is caused by repeated friction; it occurs especially in those who do much kneeling ('housemaid's knee'). There is fibrous thickening of the wall of the bursa, which is distended with fluid.</p>
                            <p><em>Suppurative prepatellar bursitis.</em> This is caused by infection of the bursa with pyogenic organisms. The wall of the bursa is acutely inflamed and the sac is distended with pus.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">POPLITEAL CYSTS</h3>
                            <p>Cystic swellings are not infrequently found in the popliteal fossa. Most are examples of irritative bursitis, usually of the semimembranosus bursa. A few are caused by herniation of the synovial cavity of the knee (Baker's cyst).</p>
                            <p><em>Semimembranosus bursitis.</em> The semimembranosus bursa lies between the medial head of the gastrocnemius and the semimembranosus. The bursa may become distended with fluid to form an elongated sac that bulges backwards between the muscle planes.</p>
                            <p><em>Baker's cyst.</em> A Baker's cyst is simply a herniation of the synovial cavity of the knee, with the formation of a fluid-filled sac extending backwards and downwards (Fig. 18.32A). It is not a primary condition but is always secondary to a disorder of the knee with persistent synovial effusion, such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">PELLEGRINI-STIEDA'S DISEASE</h3>
                            <p>Pellegrini-Stieda's disease is the name sometimes used to describe ossification in the subligamentous haematoma after partial avulsion of the medial ligament from the medial condyle of the femur. Clinically there is persistent discomfort at the medial side of the knee after an injury to the medial ligament. Radiographs show a thin plaque of new bone close to the medial condyle.</p>
                            <p><em>Calcified deposit in medial ligament.</em> It is probable that some supposed cases of Pellegrini-Stieda's disease are in fact examples of calcified deposit within the medial ligament. A similar deposit may occur in the lateral ligament.</p>
