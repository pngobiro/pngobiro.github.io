                        <p>In the orthopaedic out-patient clinic disorders of the foot are second in frequency only to disorders of the back. Their prevalence may have several causes. <strong>Hereditary factors:</strong> The foot is probably in a state of relatively rapid evolution consequent upon man's assumption of the upright posture, and perhaps for that reason it is prone to variations in structure and form which may impair its efficiency. <strong>Postural stresses:</strong> Overweight throws an increased burden on the feet, and they may be unable to withstand the stress without ill-effect, especially if the intrinsic muscles are poorly developed. <strong>Footwear:</strong> The wearing of shoes is a potent cause of foot disorders. Many types of shoe interfere seriously with the mechanics of the foot, and the ladies' shoe with high heel and pointed toe is particularly to blame.</p>

                            <p>In nearly all cases symptoms in the leg, ankle, or foot can be explained by a local abnormality. Only rarely are they referred from a distant lesion. In this respect the lower limb differs markedly from the upper, for in many cases symptoms in the hand have no local cause but are referred from a proximal lesion.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">History</h3>
                            <p>The precise distribution of pain should be ascertained. The occupation and habits of the patient, including sporting activities, may be significant, as may also be a history of previous injury. Specific enquiry should be made into the effect upon the symptoms of standing and walking.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Exposure</h3>
                            <p>It is essential that socks or stockings be removed and that the whole leg be exposed up to the knee. Both limbs must always be examined so that the two may be compared. The first part of the examination is conducted with the patient lying upon a couch. Later, the foot is examined while the patient stands.</p>

                            <p>An essential part of the examination of the foot that is often forgotten is to study the efficiency of the arterial circulation. A reasonably accurate assessment may be made on clinical evidence alone, but if surgical treatment is contemplated and vascular insufficiency is suspected it is necessary to have more precise information which can be provided only by certain special investigations.</p>
                            <p><em>Clinical assessment.</em> This is based on a study of the texture of the skin and nails, colour changes, skin temperature, the arterial pulses, auscultation, and exercise tolerance. <strong>Texture of skin and nails:</strong> The skin of an ischaemic foot loses its hair and becomes thin and inelastic. The nails are coarse, thickened and irregular. Ulceration of the tips of the toes may be noted. <strong>Colour changes:</strong> A brick-red rubor or cyanosis occurring when the foot is made dependent after a period of elevation (Buerger's test) denotes serious impairment of the arterial circulation. <strong>Temperature:</strong> A foot with impaired arterial supply is colder than normal. <strong>Arterial pulses:</strong> The pulses to be felt for are the dorsalis pedis, the posterior tibial, the popliteal and the femoral. The posterior tibial artery is felt about 2 cm behind and below the tip of the medial malleolus. <strong>Capillary return:</strong> In limb ischaemia capillary return is slowed after blanching of a digital pulp or nail by pressure. <strong>Auscultation:</strong> A bruit over one of the major limb vessels may denote partial obstruction or an arterio-venous communication.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Movements at the ankle and tarsal joints</h3>
                            <p>Since the joints are close together, movement at the tarsal joints is easily mistaken for movement at the ankle, and vice versa. Careful examination is required to determine the range at each individual joint.</p>
                            <p><strong>Ankle movement.</strong> The ankle is strictly a hinge joint. The only movements are extension (dorsiflexion) and plantarflexion. The range should be judged from the excursion of the hindfoot rather than the forefoot, so that any contribution from the tarsal joints is disregarded. Similarly, in testing the passive range, the foot should be controlled from the heel (Fig. 19.1). The normal range of ankle movement varies in different subjects; so the normal ankle must be used as a control. An average range is about $25^{\circ}$ of extension (dorsiflexion) and $35^{\circ}$ of plantarflexion.</p>

Instruct the patient alternately to invert and evert the foot, observing the range through which the heel rocks from side to side. The normal range is about $20^{\circ}$ on each side of the neutral position.</p>

                            <p>Surprising as it may seem, a ruptured calcaneal tendon (tendo Achillis) is often overlooked, the symptoms being wrongly ascribed to a strain or to a ruptured plantaris tendon.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> The rupture is nearly always complete. It occurs about 5 cm above the insertion of the tendon. If it is left untreated the tendon unites spontaneously, but with lengthening and loss of function.</p>
                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> While running or jumping, the patient feels a sudden agonising pain at the back of the ankle. He may believe that something has struck him. He is able to walk, but only with a bad limp. On examination of the back of the heel there is tenderness at the site of rupture. A gap can usually be felt in the course of the tendon. The power of plantarflexion at the ankle is greatly weakened.</p>
                            <p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> The retention of some power of plantarflexion may deflect the unwary from the correct diagnosis. The crucial test is to ask the patient to lift the heel from the ground while standing only upon the affected leg (Fig. 19.5). This is impossible if the tendon is ruptured. In cases of doubt the gap in the tendon may be well demonstrated by ultrasound or MRI scanning (Fig. 19.6).</p>

                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> Non-operative treatment may be used in selected cases, usually older and more sedentary patients. The ankle is immobilised in a below-knee plaster for 5 weeks, with the foot in slight equinus. In the majority of younger patients, particularly those who wish to continue athletic pursuits, operative treatment is preferable. It entails repair of the tendon, using non-absorbable sutures. Whether treatment is by plaster alone or by operation, it must be completed after removal of the plaster by increasingly vigorous exercises for the calf muscles.</p>

                            <p><em>Chondroma.</em> In the tibia or fibula this is seldom found except in multiple form in the condition of dyschondroplasia (p. 65).</p>

It usually arises in a young adult, expanding the bone and extending to within a short distance of the articular surface. Treatment is by excision or curettage.</p>
                            <p><strong>Malignant tumours.</strong> The tibia, like the femur, is a common site for primary malignant bone tumours, especially osteosarcoma and Ewing's tumour. <em>Osteosarcoma</em> usually affects the upper metaphysis of the tibia. <em>Ewing's tumour</em> usually affects the shaft of a long bone; the tibia is one of the commonest sites.</p>

                            <p>Intermittent claudication is a symptom of arterial insufficiency in the lower limb. In its typical form it is characterised by cramp-like pain in the calf, induced by walking and relieved by rest. The usual underlying cause is arteriosclerosis with consequent partial or total obstruction of the main limb vessel.</p>
                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> In a typical case the patient complains that after walking a certain distance - perhaps a hundred metres or so - he is forced to stop by severe cramp-like pain in the calf. After a few minutes' rest the pain disappears and he is able to walk on again for a similar distance. On examination there is objective evidence of impaired arterial circulation in the lower limb (p. 421).</p>

                            <p><strong>Pyogenic arthritis.</strong> This is uncommon. The organisms reach the joint through the blood stream or through a penetrating wound.</p>
                            <p><strong>Tuberculous arthritis.</strong> Tuberculosis is much less common in the ankle than it is in the hip and knee. The clinical features correspond to those of tuberculous arthritis of other superficial joints, with pain, swelling, increased warmth of the overlying skin, restriction of movement, and limp. Treatment by early conservative methods (p. 102) may restore a mobile ankle, but if articular cartilage is destroyed arthrodesis may be required.</p>
                            <p><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis.</strong> One or both ankles are often affected by rheumatoid arthritis in common with other joints in the lower limb. There may be marked destruction of the articular cartilage and subchondral bone with pain, stiffness, and deformity (Fig. 19.7). Arthrodesis is usually the operation of choice because it gives permanent relief of pain with good function. Replacement arthroplasty of the ankle is appropriate in some patients (Fig. 19.8), but the long-term results are much less satisfactory than with the hip or knee.</p>

                            <p><strong>Osteoarthritis.</strong> Degenerative destruction of the articular cartilage is less common in the ankle than in the knee or hip. There is nearly always a known predisposing factor, such as irregularity of the joint surfaces after a fracture (Fig. 19.9). Clinical features include slowly increasing pain and limp. Radiographs show narrowing of the cartilage space and osteophyte formation. Treatment in mild cases is palliative (physiotherapy, support). In severe cases arthrodesis provides a painless stable joint.</p>

                            <p>When the lateral ligament of the ankle is torn and fails to heal there may be persistent instability with recurrent attacks of giving way in which the talus tilts medially in the ankle mortise.</p>
                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> The patient complains that the ankle 'goes over' at frequent intervals. There is tenderness over the site of the lateral ligament. Abnormal mobility is present as shown by the fact that the heel can be inverted passively beyond the normal range.</p>
                            <p><strong>Radiographic features.</strong> Antero-posterior films must be taken while the heel is held fully inverted. If the lateral ligament is torn or lax the talus will be shown tilted away from the tibio-fibular mortise at the lateral side through $20$ or $30^{\circ}$ or more (Fig. 19.10).</p>

                            <p>The rather vague term 'club foot' has come to be synonymous in the minds of most surgeons with the commonest and most important congenital deformity of the foot-talipes equino-varus (Fig. 19.11).</p>
                            <p><strong>Cause.</strong> This is still under debate. In most cases a defect of fetal development is responsible. A neuromuscular defect is possibly relevant.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> The crucial component of the deformity is subluxation of the talo-navicular joint, so that the navicular bone lies partly on the medial aspect of the head of the talus instead of on its distal aspect (Fig. 19.12). The foot is adducted and inverted at the subtalar, midtarsal, and anterior tarsal joints, and is held in equinus (plantarflexion) at the ankle. In most cases under-development of the calf and peroneal muscles is a striking feature.</p>

                            </figure>

                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> The deformity consists of three elements: 1. inversion; 2. adduction of the forefoot; 3. equinus. The foot cannot be pushed passively through the normal range of eversion and dorsiflexion.</p>
                            <p><strong>Radiographic features.</strong> In the antero-posterior radiograph of a normal foot a line projecting the long axis of the talus forwards passes medial to the first metatarsal bone. In uncorrected club foot the line passes lateral to the metatarsal (Fig. 19.12B).</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> The most widely accepted practice is to rely upon conservative treatment by correction and splintage during the first year of life (often using the so-called Ponseti technique). The principles are: 1. to correct and over-correct the deformity by firm manual pressure (Fig. 19.13); 2. to hold the foot in the over-corrected position (usually by a plaster of Paris cast). If treatment by manipulation and retention fails, operation should usually be undertaken before the age of 9 months. The operation sets the tarsal bones in normal relationship to one another.</p>

                            <p>In pes cavus or 'hollow foot' the longitudinal arch of the foot is accentuated. The metatarsal heads are lowered in relation to the hind part of the foot. There is always associated clawing of the toes (Fig. 19.18). Consequently excessive weight falls upon the metatarsal heads, and hard callosities form. The base of the spine should be examined for a congenital anomaly such as spina bifida. Treatment may involve soft-tissue operations (Steindler muscle-slide) or bony operations (arthrodesis) in severe cases.</p>
