                            <p>Primary bone tumours, both benign and malignant, are relatively uncommon in comparison with the malignancies arising in other tissues of the body. They are also much less common than metastatic (secondary) tumours which affect the skeleton by blood stream spread from primary carcinoma of the breast, prostate, lung or kidney.</p>
                            <p>The importance of primary bone tumours is not their frequent occurrence, but the difficulty they may present in diagnosis and treatment and the need to distinguish them from a number of tumour-like lesions that affect bone. Tumours originating in bone arise from mesenchymal tissue and if malignant are termed sarcoma. They are normally classified by the predominant cell type in the lesion, which may be bone, cartilage or fibrous tissue (Table 8.1).</p>

                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> Bone tumours may present clinically with local pain unrelated to activity, local swelling, limp, pathological fracture, or a combination of these symptoms. Many benign tumours may be asymptomatic and are detected as a chance finding on a radiograph taken for unrelated indications. To reach an accurate and rapid diagnosis may require access to a skilled multi-disciplinary team of radiologist, pathologist, and oncologist, as well as an orthopaedic surgeon. This is particularly important where a malignant tumour is suspected since this may require complex and extended management utilising adjuvant therapy as well as surgical treatment.</p>
                            <p><strong>Imaging of bone tumours.</strong> Bone tumours are still best evaluated by plain films. MR scanning is required to identify the full extent of the tumour and its relationship to key anatomical structures. However, the differentiation of the most likely tumour type is still best undertaken by careful evaluation of the plain film findings.</p>
                            <p>In evaluating any lesion of the bone the following key observations will allow a correct diagnosis to be made in the majority of cases.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">•</span> <strong>Age of the patient.</strong> Many tumours are most commonly found in specific age groups. Ewing's sarcoma and simple bone cysts occur in children and young adults. Chondrosarcoma generally affects patients over the age of 40.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">•</span> <strong>Single or multiple lesions.</strong> Most true primary bone tumours are solitary lesions. The presence of multiple lesions suggests bone metastases, though less commonly these may occur in myeloma or lymphoma.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">•</span> <strong>Site of tumour.</strong> The bone involved and the site of involvement; whether epiphysis, diaphysis or metaphysis is important. Certain tumours have a predilection for particular bones and some occur most typically in certain parts of the bone. Giant cell tumours are almost always found in a subarticular position, i.e. epiphyseal location.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">•</span> <strong>Margin of the lesion.</strong> Slow-growing tumours have well-defined sometimes sclerotic margins and are most likely benign. Rapidly growing lesions will have ill-defined margins and appear to permeate diffusely into the surrounding bone. While this typically indicates a malignant process, other rapidly progressing conditions, such as acute osteomyelitis, can give a similar appearance.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">•</span> <strong>Appearance of matrix.</strong> Lesions of mainly cartilage tissue will tend to show areas of calcification. A lesion arising from bone-forming cells may contain areas of ossification. If either of these findings is present then the differential diagnosis is narrowed considerably.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">•</span> <strong>Periosteal reaction.</strong> If present, a periosteal reaction gives clues as to the nature of the underlying lesion. A thick well-organised periosteal reaction implies a slow-growing lesion, as for example with osteoid osteoma. A periosteal reaction consisting of layers of thin periosteum implies rapid growth and is generally indicative of a rapidly growing malignant lesion.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">•</span> <strong>Breach of cortex.</strong> Destruction of the cortex indicates an aggressive invasive lesion.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">•</span> <strong>Soft tissue mass.</strong> If present extension into soft tissues is also evidence of a rapidly growing aggressive lesion.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Of the above the most helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis is the age of the patient and the site of the tumour. With these two pieces of information alone it is possible to suggest the correct diagnosis in the majority of cases.</p>
                            <p><strong>Other investigations.</strong> Blood tests should be undertaken routinely, though these rarely provide a definitive diagnosis. A raised white cell count with an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein suggests the possibility of a bone infection. Hypercalcaemia suggests extensive bone resorption from hyperparathyroidism, or the presence of multiple bone metastases or myeloma deposits. Multiple myeloma can be confirmed when the plasma proteins show a very high globulin level, while prostatic carcinoma spread is accompanied by a raised serum acid phosphatase.</p>
                            <p><strong>Biopsy.</strong> In the majority of cases it is necessary to undertake a biopsy of material from the lesion for histological and bacteriological examination to reach a final definitive diagnosis. The biopsy may be an open procedure, or a closed needle or trephine technique may be used. The closed technique may be guided by CT scanning, but gives very little material for additional investigations, such as immunohistochemistry or cytogenetics. Needle biopsy should only be used where advice is available from an expert bone pathologist with the necessary technical resources for processing small tissue samples. Once diagnosed the treatment of the lesion depends on whether it is benign or malignant and will be described in more detail for the individual types of tumour.</p>

                            <p>This is a benign circumscribed lesion that may arise in the cortex of long bones or occasionally in the cancellous bone of the spine. It affects young patients aged $10-35$ and is three-times commoner in males.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> The characteristic feature is the formation of a small nidus of osteoid tissue, usually less than 0.5 cm diameter, surrounded by a reactive zone of dense sclerotic new bone formation (Fig. 8.1).</p>
                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> They usually present with increasingly severe, but well-localised, deep aching pain and sometimes local bone tenderness. The pain is worse at night and is eased by aspirin or NSAIDs, a diagnostic feature.</p>
                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> Plain radiographs typically show local sclerotic thickening of the shaft that may obscure the small central nidus within the area of rarefaction (Fig. 8.5). The nidus is best seen on a fine cut CT scan (Fig. 8.6) and also exhibits intense uptake on an isotope bone scan.</p>

                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> In younger patients some osteomas may resolve spontaneously after several months, but most require surgical treatment. Removal of the central nidus results in resolution of the reactive bone formation and dramatic relief of symptoms. This can be achieved by open surgical excision or curettage, but increasingly less-invasive methods are being used. Where the necessary equipment is available, a CT-guided needle can be inserted into the nidus and the lesion ablated with radiofrequency coagulation.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Chondroma</h3>
                            <p>This is a tumour composed of translucent hyaline cartilage, usually presenting in the $15-50$ age group.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> There are two forms of chondroma: in the commonest type the tumour grows within a bone and expands it (enchondroma) (Fig. 8.2); in the other more rare form it grows outward from a bone (periosteal chondroma or ecchondroma). Most periosteal chondromas arise in the hands or feet, or from flat bones such as the scapula or ilium. They often reach a large size and are more prone to develop malignant change. Enchondromas are fairly common in the long bones, but over $50 \%$ occur in the small bones of the hands and feet. The affected bone is expanded by the tumour and its cortex is much thinned; so pathological fracture is common and usually the presenting feature. Many remain asymptomatic and are only discovered as chance findings on radiographs taken for other purposes.</p>
                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> Central enchondromas expand the bone with thinning, but not erosion, of the cortex and exhibit a variable degree of mineralisation or speckled calcification (Fig. 8.7).</p>

                            </figure>

                            <p>Multiple enchondromata of the major long bones occur mainly in the distinct, but rare, clinical condition known as dyschondroplasia (multiple chondromatosis or Ollier's disease) (p. 65). In this disorder, which begins in childhood, enchondromata arise in the region of the growing epiphysial cartilages (growth plates) of several bones: they interfere with normal growth at the epiphysial plate and consequently may lead to shortening or deformity.</p>
                            <p>Occasionally an enchondroma undergoes malignant change, becoming a chondrosarcoma, usually in one of the major long bones rather than in the small bones of the hands or feet. Clinically this should be suspected when there is a sudden increase in size of the swelling or if the lesion becomes painful.</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> A chondroma is often best left alone. If it causes a fracture or is unsightly it should be removed by curettage and the defect filled with bone graft.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Osteochondroma (osteocartilaginous exostosis)</h3>
                            <p>This is the commonest benign tumour of bone, usually presenting in the 10-20 age group.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> The tumour originates in childhood from the growing epiphysial cartilage plate, but as the bone grows in length the outgrowth gets 'left behind' and tends to point away from the adjacent joint. It frequently grows outwards from the bone like a mushroom with a bony stalk in continuity with the cortex of the underlying bone (Fig. 8.3). Less commonly the lesion may be sessile with a more broad-based origin. The bony stalk has a larger cap of cartilage which continues to grow until the cessation of skeletal growth.</p>
                            <p>The ordinary osteochondroma is single; but in the condition known as diaphysial aclasis (multiple exostoses) (p. 63) the tumours affect several or many bones. The risk of malignant change to a chondrosarcoma is higher in these multiple lesions than in the solitary lesion and should be suspected if the tumour continues to enlarge or becomes painful after puberty.</p>
                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> The tumour may be noticed as a circumscribed hard swelling near a joint, but is usually painless. It may become painful due to pressure effects on adjacent nerve or vascular structures, or from the formation of an overlying pseudobursa, though increase in size and pain should always be regarded with suspicion.</p>
                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> Plain radiographs show the mushroom-like stalk of the bony tumour (Fig. 8.8), but not the larger cartilaginous cap until this calcifies once skeletal maturity is reached. Patients with known lesions should be warned to seek referral for further imaging if their swelling enlarges or becomes painful.</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> The tumour should be excised if it causes pain or if it enlarges after puberty and must be sent for routine histological examination to exclude any malignant change.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Giant-cell tumour (osteoclastoma)</h3>
                            <p>This is an important tumour because, though generally classed as benign, it tends to recur after local removal or curettage. It occurs most commonly in young adults in the 20-40 age group. In about $10 \%$ of cases it behaves as a frankly malignant tumour, metastasising through the blood stream to the lungs.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> The commonest sites are the lower end of the femur, the upper end of the tibia, the lower end of the radius, and the upper end of the humerus that is, at those ends of the long bones at which most growth occurs. It may also occur in the spine and sacrum. Characteristically it occurs in the end of the bone, occupying the epiphysial region and often extending almost to the joint surface (Fig. 8.4). It destroys the bone substance, but new bone forms beneath the raised periosteum, so that the bone end becomes expanded and pathological fracture is common.</p>
                            <p>Histologically the tumour consists of abundant mononuclear oval or spindleshaped stromal cells profusely interspersed with giant cells that may contain as many as fifty nuclei (Fig. 8.9), hence the name 'giant cell tumour'. The giant cells possibly represent fused conglomerations of the oval or spindle-shaped stromal cells, which may frequently show mitotic figures, though this is not necessarily indicative of malignant change.</p>
                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> The symptoms are pain at the site of the tumour and a gradually increasing local swelling. Sometimes the patient is made suddenly aware that something is wrong by the occurrence of a pathological fracture. Examination reveals a bony swelling which may be tender on firm palpation.</p>
                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> Radiographs show lytic destruction of the bone substance, with expansion of the cortex, but no sclerotic rim or periosteal reaction (Fig. 8.10). A few bony trabeculae may remain within the tumour giving a faintly loculated appearance. The tumour tends to grow eccentrically, and often extends as far as the articular surface of the bone. Magnetic resonance imaging will help to determine the amount of soft tissue extension of the tumour (Fig. 8.11).</p>

                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> This depends upon the site of the tumour. Curettage of the contents with a high-speed burr is the standard method of treatment for most giant cell tumours, though this is associated with a high rate (20-25%) of recurrence. This rate can be reduced to less than $10 \%$ by the use of adjuvant treatment applied to the lining of the cavity after curettage. Methods used include the chemical phenol, freezing with liquid nitrogen, or the insertion of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement. In addition to its exothermic reaction on any residual cells, the cement has the added advantage of providing support to the subchondral bone and cartilage of the articular surface of the joint. In some bones, or after multiple recurrences, it may be possible to excise the tumour and replace it with allograft bone or a metal prosthesis, without undue functional compromise. Sites where this is possible include the distal radius, distal femur, and proximal tibia.</p>
                            <p>Radiotherapy is sometimes used and is capable of bringing about permanent cure, but there is a risk that it may itself induce malignant change, perhaps many years later. It should therefore be confined to tumours at sites that are inaccessible to operation, particularly in the spinal column and sacrum.</p>

                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> An osteosarcoma arises from primitive bone-forming cells. The commonest sites are the lower end of the femur, the upper end of the tibia, and the upper end of the humerus - that is, in those areas in which, prior to epiphysial fusion, most active growth is occurring. The tumour begins in the metaphysis-that is, the part of the shaft that is adjacent to the epiphysial plate. It destroys the bone structure and eventually bursts into the surrounding soft tissues, though it seldom crosses the epiphysial cartilage into the epiphysis itself (Fig. 8.12). The histological appearance varies widely, because any type of connective tissue may be represented. Thus the tumour may be composed largely of fibrous tissue, of cartilage or of myxomatous tissue; but characteristically there will always be found, in some parts of the tumour, areas of neoplastic new bone or osteoid tissue that indicate the true nature of the lesion, and in some cases newly formed bone is abundant (Fig. 8.16). The tumour metastasises early by the blood stream, especially to the lungs and sometimes to other bones.</p>

                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> The usual presentation is local bone pain associated with a gradually increasing swelling. Examination reveals a diffuse firm thickening near the end of a bone, close to the joint. The overlying skin is warmer than normal because of the vascularity of the tumour; and the part may be so distended by tumour that the skin appears stretched and shiny.</p>
                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> Plain radiographs show irregular medullary and cortical destruction of the metaphysis. Later the cortex appears to have been 'burst open' at one or more places by the soft tissue extension (Fig. 8.17), but there are always vestiges of the original cortex. MR scanning allows accurate delineation of the tumour size and the extent of invasion of the soft tissues (Fig. 8.18). There is usually evidence of new bone formation under the corners of the aggressive periosteal reaction (Codman's triangle) (Fig. 8.17B). Occasionally well-marked radiating spicules of new bone are seen within the tumour ('sun-ray' appearance) (Fig. 8.17A). In a parosteal osteosarcoma, a variant that may occur in older patients with a better prognosis, there may be profuse formation of new bone on the surface of the cortex.</p>

                            <p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> In atypical cases an osteosarcoma may be confused with subacute osteomyelitis, or with other bone tumours. A representative piece of the tumour should always be removed by closed needle or open biopsy and sent for histological examination.</p>
                            <p><strong>Prognosis.</strong> Prior to the introduction of effective chemotherapy, the mortality was in the region of $80 \%$. Recent advances in adjuvant treatment have changed the prognosis markedly for the better.</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> The introduction of new powerful cytotoxic drugs for adjuvant chemotherapy has revolutionised the treatment of these tumours. Chemotherapy is usually commenced before surgical treatment, and is continued intermittently for 6 months to a year after ablation of the tumour. The ability of chemotherapy to control local recurrence and distant metastatic spread has permitted the increasing use of 'limb salvage surgery' as an alternative to amputation.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Chondrosarcoma of bone</h3>
                            <p>A chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumour derived from cartilage cells, and it tends to maintain its cartilaginous character throughout its evolution.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> It may develop in the interior of the bone (central chondrosarcoma) or upon its surface (peripheral chondrosarcoma). A central chondrosarcoma occurs most commonly in the femur, the tibia, or the humerus. A peripheral chondrosarcoma tends usually to affect a flat bone such as the innominate bone (Figs 8.23 and 8.24), the sacrum, or the scapula.</p>

                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> The patient is usually in the 30-60 age group, who complains of pain and local swelling.</p>
                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> Radiographically, a central chondrosarcoma is seen to grow at the expense of the cortical bone with endosteal scalloping and may result in pathological fracture. In contrast a peripheral chondrosarcoma shows as a large mass growing outwards from the surface of the bone. Both types characteristically show blotchy areas of calcification within the tumour mass. Magnetic resonance scanning is essential to define the soft tissue extension of the tumour.</p>
                            <p><strong>Prognosis.</strong> A chondrosarcoma grows slowly and does not metastasise early; so the prognosis, depending on the grade of the tumour, is somewhat more favourable than it is for osteosarcoma.</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> Since adjuvant chemotherapy is not effective against chondrosarcoma, surgery must remain the treatment of choice.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone</h3>
                            <p>This rare highly malignant tumour includes many of the lesions once classified as fibrosarcoma, because their histology shows a predominance of fibroblasttype cells mixed with primitive histiocytes. It affects adults in the 20-60 age group, mainly occurring in the diaphysis of long bones, presenting with pain, swelling and sometimes pathological fracture. Treatment is similar to osteosarcoma, requiring radical surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Ewing's tumour (endothelial sarcoma of bone)</h3>
                            <p>Ewing's tumour is an uncommon but highly malignant sarcoma that arises in bone marrow.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> The tumour is commonest in the shaft of the femur, tibia, or humerus. Unlike osteosarcoma, it arises in the diaphysis rather than the metaphysis of a bone. It probably develops from endothelial elements within the bone marrow. Histologically the tumour consists of sheets of uniform small round cells (Fig. 8.26).</p>

                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> Children and adolescents in the 5-20 age group are the usual victims. Typically, there is local pain with rapidly increasing firm swelling over one of the long bones, usually near the middle of the shaft. Local symptoms may be accompanied by fever, weight loss and general malaise.</p>
                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> Plain radiographs show destruction of bone substance with concentric layers of subperiosteal new bone ('onion-peel' appearance) (Fig. 8.27). MR scanning will reveal the extent of the large soft tissue mass of the tumour (Fig. 8.28).</p>

                            <p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> In atypical cases there may be confusion with subacute osteomyelitis, because of the systemic disturbance and raised ESR.</p>
                            <p><strong>Prognosis.</strong> The advent of adjuvant chemotherapy and improved radiotherapy has changed the gloomy outlook, and now 5-year survival rates can be expected in $50-60 \%$ of cases.</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> Chemotherapy differs from that used for osteosarcoma and a number of different drug combinations have been used and continue to evolve. The tumour itself may be treated by radical operative excision with prosthetic replacement, or by amputation. Radiotherapy may be used as an alternative to operation, since the tumour is radiosensitive.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Myeloma (myelomatosis; plasmacytoma)</h3>
                            <p>This is a tumour of bone marrow, occurring in older adults aged 50-70, often presenting as a single lesion but later spreading to involve the bone marrow at other sites.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> It arises from the plasma cells of the bone marrow and is disseminated to many parts of the skeleton through the blood stream. Less commonly the tumour may present as a solitary bone plasmacytoma (Fig. 8.29) with spread to other skeletal sites only after months or years. The lesions are mostly small and circumscribed (Figs 8.14 and 8.30) but occasionally large. Histologically the tumour consists of a mass of small round cells of plasma-cell type (Fig. 8.31).</p>

                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> The tumour foci respond to radiotherapy for a while, and pain is well relieved. The mainstay of chemotherapy in the past has been melphalan, an alkylating agent. Newer drug combinations are showing improved results.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">Secondary (metastatic) tumours in bone</h3>
                            <p>Secondary malignant tumours in bone are much more common than primary tumours; but whereas most primary malignant bone tumours occur in children or young adults, secondary tumours generally occur in later life.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> The tumours that metastasise most readily to bone are carcinomas of the lung, breast, prostate, thyroid, and kidney (hypernephroma). Metastases occur most commonly in the parts of the skeleton that contain vascular marrow. The bone structure is simply destroyed and replaced by tumour tissue (Fig. 8.15). Pathological fracture is therefore very liable to occur.</p>
                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> Pain is the usual main symptom, but sometimes the disability is insignificant until a pathological fracture occurs.</p>
                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> In plain radiographs the bone appears to have been eaten away so that there is a clear circumscribed area of lysis, without any reaction in the surrounding bone (Fig. 8.32). Exceptionally, new bone is laid down within the metastasis, causing marked sclerosis - the exact opposite to the usual osteolytic lesion. This type is almost confined to secondary deposits from prostatic carcinoma. Technetium isotope scanning is the best technique for detecting occult metastatic deposits in the skeleton, as areas of increased uptake.</p>

                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> Radiotherapy is a valuable palliative treatment. Chemotherapy is sometimes appropriate. Hormone analogue therapy may be appropriate for metastases from the breast or prostate.</p>

                            <p>This is a convenient place to note that changes may occur in the skeleton in leukaemia and in Hodgkin's disease or related lymphomas. In leukaemia the changes are due to infiltration of bone by proliferating white cells, and they are seen most commonly in subacute lymphatic leukaemia in children. In Hodgkin's disease or the related lymphomas there may be osteolytic lesions in the proximal limb bones or in the spine or pelvis, denoting destruction and replacement by tumour tissue.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">SIMPLE BONE CYST (Solitary bone cyst; unicameral bone cyst)</h3>
                            <p>Simple bone cysts occur mostly in the long bones of children or adolescents, commonly affecting the metaphysis of the proximal humerus or femur. They also occur occasionally in the small bones of the adult carpus, especially in the scaphoid or lunate bone.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> The cyst begins as a spherical lesion, but as it enlarges it tends to become oblong with its long diameter in the axis of the bone. The cyst contains clear fluid. It weakens the bone and often leads to pathological fracture. Histologically, a bone cyst has only a very thin connective-tissue lining. Its wall contains abundant osteoclasts, a fact that has led to confusion with giant-cell tumour.</p>
                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> Solitary bone cysts seldom cause symptoms unless a pathological fracture occurs and are usually a chance radiological finding.</p>
                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> Plain radiographs show a circumscribed area of lucency with only a thin surrounding zone of sclerosis (Fig. 8.33A). The cyst may appear faintly loculated and the overlying cortex may be thinned, or if fractured, a cortical fragment may drop into the cyst ('fallen fragment').</p>

                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> Small uncomplicated cysts do not require treatment, since they tend to heal after skeletal maturity (Fig. 8.33B), but they should be kept under periodic observation. A large cyst may be curetted and packed with bone chips, but percutaneous aspiration and injection of corticosteroid solution or autogenous bone marrow into the cyst have now replaced operative treatment as the principal method of management.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-subtitle">ANEURYSMAL BONE CYST</h3>
                            <p>Aneurysmal bone cysts also occur in children or young adults, usually before epiphyseal closure, but they are distinct from the simple bone cysts described above. Their origin is unknown: the term 'aneurysmal' signifies no more than a seeming 'blown-out' distension of one surface of the bone. There is no relationship to arterial aneurysm. The cyst may bulge into the soft tissues, contained only by periosteum and a thin shell of newly formed cortex. The lining consists of connective tissue with numerous vascular spaces and some giant cells; the cyst contains fluid blood.</p>
                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> Plain radiographs show the cyst to be situated eccentrically in the bone; it presents a characteristic 'blown-out' appearance, as already mentioned (Fig. 8.34).</p>

                            <p>The term osteochondritis juvenilis, or simply osteochondritis, is used to describe certain obscure affections of developing bony nuclei in children and adolescents. Typically, a bony centre affected by osteochondritis becomes temporarily softened, and while in the softened state it is liable to deformation by pressure. The disease runs a course of variable length (often about 3 years), but eventually spontaneous rehardening occurs. The precise cause of the disease is unknown, but it is widely believed that temporary interruption of the blood supply to the affected epiphysis is the predominant factor.</p>

                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> In a typical example of osteochondritis the histological and radiological evidence suggests that the affected bony centre undergoes partial necrosis, possibly from interference with its blood supply. The necrotic bone is invaded by granulation tissue, broken up, and eventually removed by osteoclasts. During this stage of fragmentation the centre is liable to deformation if subjected to pressure (Fig. 8.37). The dead tissue is gradually replaced by new living bone trabeculae and eventually the bone texture is restored to normal; but if deformation has been allowed to take place there is permanent alteration of shape.</p>

                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> The age at which the condition arises varies according to the particular bone affected. In general, it occurs during the stage of active development of the bony nucleus. The main symptom is local pain. If the affected epiphysis forms part of a joint, the function of the joint is disturbed and joint movement aggravates the pain. The general health is not impaired.</p>
                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> Radiographic examination. The cycle of changes can be followed in serial radiographs taken at intervals of a few months. First there is a slight and often patchy increase in density of the bony nucleus. Next the patchy appearance passes to one of fragmentation, representing irregular absorption of dead bone by osteoclasts and the commencing deposition of new bone. At this stage some flattening of the nucleus may be apparent by comparison with the normal side. Later there is a gradual return to normal bone texture, but any flattening that has occurred will remain. Radioisotope bone scanning may show absence of uptake of the isotope ('cold scan') during the stage at which the epiphysis is avascular.</p>
                            <p><strong>Prognosis.</strong> Osteochondritis in itself is harmless to the general health, but if it leads to distortion of a joint surface it predisposes to osteoarthritis which, in the case of a large joint such as the hip, may cause serious disability in later years.</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> The treatment depends largely upon the site of the affection. When the bony nucleus is relatively unimportant (as for instance that of the navicular bone) treatment may be unnecessary, or it may be sufficient to protect the part in a plaster for six or eight weeks while the pain is severe. But in the case of osteochondritis involving a major joint such as the hip every effort must be made to prevent distortion of the softened epiphysis.</p>
