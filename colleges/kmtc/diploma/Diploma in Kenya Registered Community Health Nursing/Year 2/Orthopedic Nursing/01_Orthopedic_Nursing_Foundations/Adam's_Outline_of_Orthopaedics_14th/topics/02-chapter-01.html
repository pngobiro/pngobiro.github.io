                        <p>In this part guidance is given on the correct line of approach to an orthopaedic problem, with particular reference to diagnosis and treatment.</p>
                        <p>As in all branches of medicine and surgery, proficiency in diagnosis can be acquired only from long experience. There is no short cut to a familiarity with physical signs or to skill in radiographic interpretation. Nevertheless the inexperienced surgeon who tackles the problem methodically step by step will often achieve a better result than a more experienced colleague who makes a 'snap' diagnosis after no more than a cursory investigation.</p>
                        <p>The essential clinical skills to obtain an adequate differential diagnosis remain the ability to take a careful history and perform an appropriate physical examination. The dramatic improvements in imaging techniques and other sophisticated investigations, though valuable, should not be allowed to replace these vital preliminary steps. Instead they should be used in a more efficient and cost-effective manner to complement and refine the clinical diagnostic skills. To reflect the increased importance of imaging, a new chapter has been added describing the range of methods available and their role in diagnosing and facilitating the treatment of orthopaedic disease. It is also worth noting the expansion of arthroscopy as a diagnostic tool for viewing the internal structure of most of the larger joints of the limbs, in addition to its use in treatment.</p>
                        <p>In the choice of treatment, whether conservative or surgical, the development of a sound judgement is also largely a matter of experience. Yet more than that is needed. Other essential qualities are common sense and a sympathetic appreciation of human problems. There are surgeons who never acquire a sound judgement, however long their apprenticeship. Others seem to have a natural aptitude that quickly matures under proper guidance and training.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>In the diagnosis of orthopaedic conditions the history is often of first importance. In cases of torn meniscus in the knee, for instance, the clinical diagnosis sometimes depends upon the history alone. Except in the most obvious conditions, a detailed history is always required.</p>
                            <p>First the exact nature of the patient's complaint is determined. Then the development of the symptoms is traced step by step from their earliest beginning up to the time of the consultation. The patient's own views on the cause of the symptoms are always worth recording: often they prove to be correct. Enquiry is made into activities that have been found to improve the symptoms or to make them worse, and into the effect of any previous treatment. Facts that often have an important bearing on the condition are the age and present occupation of the patient, previous occupations, hobbies and recreational activities, and previous injuries.</p>
                            <p>When a full history of the local symptoms has been obtained, do not omit to enquire whether there have been symptoms in other parts of the body, and whether the general health is affected. Ask also about previous illnesses.</p>
                            <p>Finally, in cases that seem trivial, a tactful enquiry as to why the patient decided to seek advice, and to what extent he is worried by his disability, will often give a valuable clue to the underlying problem. It should be remembered that very often patients seek advice not because they are handicapped by a disability (which is often insignificant) but because they fear the development of some serious disease such as cancer, paralysis, or progressive crippling deformity.</p>
                        </div>
                    </section>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The part complained of is examined according to a rigid routine which should become habitual. If this is done, familiarity with the routine will ensure that no step in the examination is forgotten. Accuracy of observation is essential: it can be acquired only by much practice and by diligent attention to detail.</p>
                            <p>The examination of the part complained of does not complete the clinical examination. It sometimes happens that symptoms felt in one part have their origin in another. For example, pain in the leg is often caused by a lesion in the spine, and pain in the knee may have its origin in the hip. The possibility of a distant lesion must therefore be considered and an examination made of any region under suspicion.</p>
                            <p>Finally, localised symptoms may be the first or only manifestation of a generalised or widespread disorder. A brief examination is therefore made of the rest of the body with this possibility in mind.</p>
                            <p>Thus the clinical examination may be considered under three headings:</p>

                                </div>

                                    <p>The question often arises: what is the cause of a diffuse swelling of a joint? The answer can be supplied after careful palpation. For practical purposes a diffuse swelling of the joint as a whole can have only three causes:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>thickening of the bone end</li>
                                        <li>fluid within the joint</li>
                                        <li>thickening of the synovial membrane.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>In some cases two or all three causes may be combined, but they can always be differentiated by palpation. Bony thickening is detected by deep palpation through the soft tissues, the bone outlines being compared on the two sides. A fluid effusion generally gives a clear sense of fluctuation between the two palpating hands. Synovial thickening gives a characteristic boggy sensation rather as if a layer of soft sponge-rubber had been placed between the skin and the bone. It is nearly always accompanied by a well-marked increase of local warmth, for the synovium is a very vascular membrane.</p>

                            <p>Measurement of limb length is often necessary, especially in the lower limbs, where discrepancy between the two sides is important. Measurement of the circumference of a limb segment on the two sides is also important if any asymmetry is suspected. It provides an index of muscle wasting, soft-tissue swelling or bony thickening. Details will be given in the chapters on individual regions.</p>
                            
                            <h5 class="card-subtitle-small">Estimation of fixed deformity</h5>
                            <p>Fixed deformity exists when a joint cannot be placed in the neutral (anatomical) position. Its causes are described on page 56. The degree of fixed deformity at a joint is determined by bringing the joint as near as it will come to the neutral position and then measuring the angle by which it falls short.</p>

In <strong>valgus</strong> deformity the distal part of a member is deviated laterally (outwards) in relation to the proximal part. Thus, for example, in hallux valgus the toe is deviated outwards in relation to the foot; and in genu valgum the lower leg is deviated outwards in relation to the thigh. <strong>Varus</strong> deformity is the opposite: the distal part of a member is deviated medially (inwards) in relation to the proximal part (examples - cubitus varus and genu varum).</p>

                            <p>In measuring the range of movement it is important to know what is the normal. The range is recorded as an angle usually measured from the straight position of the joint as neutral. Measurement can be facilitated by the use of a jointed protractor with long arms, termed a goniometer. With some joints the normal varies considerably from patient to patient; as, for instance, at the metacarpo-phalangeal joint of the thumb: so it is wise always to use the unaffected limb for comparison. Restriction of movement in all directions suggests some form of arthritis, whereas selective limitation of movement in some directions, with free movement in others, is more suggestive of a mechanical derangement.</p>
                            <p>Except in two sets of circumstances passive movement will usually be found equal to the active range. The passive range will exceed the active only in the following circumstances:</p>

                            <p>The stability of a joint depends partly upon the integrity of its articulating surfaces, partly upon intact ligaments, and to some extent upon healthy muscles. When a joint is unstable there is abnormal mobility - for instance, lateral mobility in a hinge joint. It is important, when testing for abnormal mobility, to ensure that the muscles controlling the joint are relaxed; for a muscle in strong contraction can often conceal ligamentous instability.</p>

                            <p>The power of the muscles responsible for each movement of a joint is determined by instructing the patient to move the joint against the resistance of the examiner. With careful comparison of the two sides it is possible to detect gross impairment of power.

In unilateral affections the opposite side should be similarly tested for comparison. The precise area of any blunting or loss of sensibility should be carefully mapped out, and from a knowledge of the sensory dermatomes and the cutaneous distribution of the peripheral nerves the particular nerve or nerves affected may be identified and the root value established.</p>

Time should therefore be spent in assessing the state of the circulation by examination of the colour and temperature of the skin, the texture of the skin and nails, and the arterial pulses; and by such special investigations as may be necessary. This examination is particularly important in the case of the lower limb. Further details are given on page 420.</p>

                            <p>It is necessary next to test the function of the part under examination. How much does the disorder affect the part in its fulfilment of everyday activities? Methods of determining this vary according to the part affected. To take the lower limb as an example, the best test of function is to observe the patient standing, walking, running and jumping, or climbing and descending stairs. Special tests are required to investigate certain functions - for example, the Trendelenburg test for abductor efficiency at the hip (p. 340).</p>

                            <p>When the source of the symptoms is still in doubt after careful examination of the part complained of, attention must be directed to possible extrinsic disorders with referred symptoms. This will entail examination of such other regions of the body as might be responsible. For instance, in a case of pain in the shoulder it might be necessary to examine the neck for evidence of a lesion interfering with the brachial plexus, and the thorax and abdomen for evidence of diaphragmatic irritation, because either of these conditions may be a cause of shoulder pain. Again, in a case of pain in the thigh the examination will often have to include a study of the spine, abdomen, pelvis, and genito-urinary system as well as a local examination of the hip and thigh.</p>
