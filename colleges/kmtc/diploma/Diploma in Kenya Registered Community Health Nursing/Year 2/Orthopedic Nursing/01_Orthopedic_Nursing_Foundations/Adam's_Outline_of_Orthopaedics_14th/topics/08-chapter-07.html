                            <p>Infection of bone by pyogenic organisms is termed osteomyelitis. It occurs in acute and chronic forms. The only other infections of bone with which the student in Western countries need concern himself are tuberculous infections, although syphilitic infections and fungal infections may still occur occasionally in other parts of the world.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Acute haematogenous osteomyelitis is one of the important diseases of childhood. Only about $5 \%$ of cases occur in adults. Early diagnosis is especially important because a satisfactory outcome depends upon prompt and efficient treatment.</p>
                            <p><strong>Cause.</strong> It is caused by infection of the bone with pyogenic organisms - usually <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, though a variety of other organisms are occasionally responsible, including Salmonella. A minor injury to a bone may render it vulnerable to infection by organisms circulating in the blood.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> Organisms reach the bone through the blood stream from a septic focus elsewhere in the body - for instance from a boil in the skin. In a rare atypical form in adults infection reaches the vertebral column through the spinal venous plexus from an infected intrapelvic lesion.</p>
                            <p>In the usual childhood manifestation, the infection begins in the metaphysis of a long bone, which must be presumed to form a productive medium for bacterial growth (Fig. 7.1A); thence it may spread to involve a large part of the bone. The organisms induce an acute inflammatory reaction, but the marshalling of the body's defensive forces is greatly handicapped in bone because its rigid structure does not allow swelling. Pus is formed and soon finds its way to the surface of the bone where it forms a subperiosteal abscess (Fig. 7.1B); later the abscess may burst into the soft tissues and may eventually reach the surface to form a sinus.</p>
                            <p>Often the blood supply to a part of the bone is cut off by septic thrombosis of the vessels (Fig. 7.1B). The ischaemic bone dies and eventually separates from the surrounding living bone as a sequestrum (Fig. 7.1C). Meanwhile new bone is laid down beneath the stripped-up periosteum, forming an investing layer known as the involucrum (Fig. 7.1C).</p>

(B) Pus has escaped to the surface of the bone and formed a subperiosteal abscess. Part of the bone has lost its blood supply from septic thrombosis of vessels. (C) The devitalised area eventually separates as a sequestrum. Meanwhile new bone (involucrum) is formed beneath the stripped-up periosteum; it is perforated by sinuses through which pus escapes. This is the stage of chronic osteomyelitis. With prompt treatment the disease can often be arrested at the stage shown in (A).</figcaption>

                            <p>The epiphysial cartilage plate is a barrier to the spread of infection, but if the affected metaphysis lies partly within a joint cavity the joint is liable to become infected (acute pyogenic arthritis). Metaphyses that lie wholly or partly within a joint cavity include the upper metaphysis of the humerus, all the metaphyses at the elbow, and the upper and lower metaphyses of the femur (Fig. 7.2). Even when the joint is not infected it may swell from an effusion of clear fluid (sympathetic effusion).</p>
                            <p>With efficient treatment, the infection may be aborted in its earliest phase. But when it has progressed to the stage of septic thrombosis and death of bone it almost inevitably passes into a state of chronic osteomyelitis.</p>

                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> Except for rare exceptions acute haematogenous osteomyelitis is confined to children, especially boys. The bones most commonly affected are the tibia, the femur and the humerus. The onset is rapid. The child complains of feeling ill, and of severe pain over the affected bone. There may be a history of recent boils or of a minor injury.</p>
                            <p>On examination there is obvious constitutional illness with pyrexia. Locally there is exquisite tenderness over the affected bone. The area of tenderness is clearly circumscribed; it is usually near the end of the bone in the metaphysial region. The overlying skin is warmer than normal, and often the soft tissues are indurated; later a fluctuant abscess may be present. The neighbouring joint is sometimes distended with clear fluid, but a good range of movement is retained unless the infection has spread to the joint (septic arthritis): in that event movement would be greatly restricted.</p>

                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> Radiographic examination in the early stage does not show any alteration from the normal (Fig. 7.3A). Only after two or three weeks do visible changes appear, and they may never do so if efficient treatment is started very early. The important changes are diffuse rarefaction of the metaphysial area and new bone outlining the raised periosteum (Figs 7.3B and 7.4).</p>

                            <p>Radioisotope scanning with $^{99 \mathrm{~m}}$ technetium is reserved for the diagnosis of bone infection in the less clinically accessible sites such as the hip, pelvis and spine. Accumulation of isotope depends upon the rate of bone turnover and its vascularity, so that in the early stages of disease inadequate blood supply may result in a 'cold' lesion. More commonly, within a few hours or days of the onset of symptoms there is an increased uptake of isotope, giving a 'hot' scan at the site of the bone lesion. In the more obscure low-grade infections associated with prostheses and other surgical implants in bone, scanning with re-injected leucocytes labelled with $^{111 \mathrm{~m}}$ indium may provide improved diagnostic accuracy.</p>
                            <p>MRI. In many centres this has now superseded isotope scanning as it provides more anatomical information on the infection.</p>

                            <p><strong>Investigations.</strong> Blood culture may be positive in the incipient stage but this is not an invariable feature. Later there is a marked polymorphonuclear leucocytosis. The C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is increased.</p>
                            <p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Acute osteomyelitis is to be distinguished from pyogenic arthritis of the adjacent joint by the following features:</p>

                            <p>Acute osteomyelitis may also be confused with rheumatic fever, and, in infants, with vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) (p. 80).

                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> Efficient treatment must be begun at the earliest possible moment.</p>
                            <p><strong>General treatment.</strong> This is by rest in bed and systemic antibiotic therapy, started intravenously to ensure high blood levels. Initially, it is recommended that broad-spectrum antibiotics with good anti-Staphylococcus activity are used, such as a third-generation cephalosporin combined with a synthetic penicillin, but as soon as the causative organism has been identified the antibiotic to which it is most sensitive should be ordered. In cases where a multiple-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) is suspected it may be appropriate to use vancomycin instead of the penicillin. Antibiotics should be continued for at least 4 weeks, even when the response has been rapid.</p>
                            <p><strong>Local treatment.</strong> The question of operation and its timing is still controversial. Operation may be unnecessary if effective antibiotic treatment can be begun within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms, and this should always be the aim. But in practice diagnosis is not always so prompt, and in that event it seems wiser to undertake early operation, in order to release pus and to relieve pain, which is often severe. This should definitely be performed if there has not been a marked improvement to the antibiotic treatment within 48 hours. Release of pus may also reduce the risk of ischaemic bone necrosis; and furthermore it allows the organism to be identified and its sensitivity to antibiotics determined. An incision at the site of maximum tenderness is made down to the bone and subperiosteal pus is evacuated. It is advisable - though not always essential - to make one or two drill holes through the cortex to improve medullary drainage. In most cases the wound may safely be sutured. Thereafter the limb is splinted until the infection is overcome.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>When acute infection complicates open fracture or surgical operation the organisms are introduced directly through the wound. Any part of the bone may be affected, depending upon the site of injury. Suppuration and necrosis occur as in haematogenous osteomyelitis, but the pus discharges through the primary wound rather than collecting under the periosteum. The infection often becomes chronic.</p>
                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> This type of osteomyelitis may occur in children or in adults. The temperature fails to settle after the primary treatment of the wound or rises a few days later. Pain is not a prominent feature because pus is not contained under pressure. Re-examination of the wound reveals a purulent discharge.</p>
                            <p><strong>Radiographic features.</strong> In the early stages radiographs do not help significantly. Later there may be local rarefaction, and eventually sequestrum formation may be evident.</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> The main principle of treatment is to secure free drainage through the wound, which may be enlarged if necessary for the purpose. Appropriate antibacterial drugs should be ordered. Later, any bone fragment that has sequestrated should be removed.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Chronic osteomyelitis is nearly always a sequel to acute osteomyelitis. Occasionally infection is subacute or chronic from the beginning.</p>
                            <p><strong>Cause.</strong> As with acute osteomyelitis, the Staphylococcus is the usual causative organism, but streptococci, pneumococci, typhoid bacilli, or other bacteria may be responsible.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> It is commonest in the long bones. It is often confined to one end of the bone, but it may affect the whole length. The bone is thickened and generally denser than normal, though often honeycombed with granulation tissue, fibrous tissue, or pus. Sequestra are commonly present within cavities in the bone. Often a sinus track leads to the skin surface: the sinus tends to heal and break down recurrently, but if a sequestrum is present it never heals permanently.</p>
                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> The main symptom is usually a purulent discharge from a sinus over the affected bone. In other cases pain is the predominant feature which brings the patient to the doctor. Discharge of pus may be continuous or intermittent. Reappearance of a sinus that has been healed for some time is heralded by local pain, pyrexia, and the formation of an abscess. This is termed a 'flare-up', or 'flare', of infection.</p>
                            <p>On examination the bone is palpably thickened, and there are nearly always a number of overlying scars or sinuses.</p>
                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> Radiographic examination: The bone is often thickened and shows irregular and patchy sclerosis which may give a honeycombed appearance. If a sequestrum is present it is seen as a dense loose fragment, with irregular but sharply demarcated edges, lying within a cavity in the bone (Fig. 7.6). Radioisotope scanning may show increased uptake in the vicinity of the lesion. In diffuse disease MRI and CT scanning may be of value for localisation of abscess cavities and sequestra, thus allowing accurate planning of operative treatment.</p>

                            </figure>

                            <p><strong>Complications.</strong> If the bone has been much weakened by disease pathological fracture may occur. Rarely, amyloid disease may complicate long-continued chronic osteomyelitis with persistent discharge of pus. Another rare complication in cases of many years' duration is the development of squamous celled carcinoma in a sinus.</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> An acute flare-up of chronic osteomyelitis often subsides with rest and antibiotics. If an abscess forms outside the bone it must be drained. If there is a persistent and profuse discharge of pus a more extensive operation is advised. The aim should be to remove fragments of infected dead bone (sequestra) and to open up or 'saucerise' abscess cavities by chiselling away the overlying bone. Sometimes it is possible to obliterate a cavity with a flap of muscle, or to exteriorise it and line its walls directly with split-skin grafts. The principles of treatment are (1) remove dead and foreign material, (2) obliterate dead space, (3) if necessary, stabilise the skeleton, (4) obtain soft tissue cover, (5) if necessary, reconstruction of the bone defect, (6) possible appropriate antibiotic cover.</p>

                            <p>Tuberculous infection of bone is uncommon except in the vertebral bodies and in association with tuberculous infection of joints. Occasionally it occurs as an isolated lesion in a long bone or in a bone of the hand or foot.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> Tubercle bacilli reach the bone either through the blood stream or by direct extension from an adjacent focus of infection in joint or soft tissue. There is a typical tuberculous inflammatory reaction. Part of the bone is destroyed and replaced by granulation tissue. A tuberculous abscess is commonly formed; it tracks beneath the soft tissues or towards the surface of the body. With treatment there is a tendency to healing, with fibrosis.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-subtitle">Tuberculosis of a vertebra</h4>
                            <p>The infection typically affects the vertebral body. It may arise initially in the bone (Fig. 7.8A) or it may spread to the vertebra from the adjacent intervertebral disc. Tuberculous vertebral bodies collapse anteriorly but often retain their full depth behind, thereby becoming wedge-shaped (Fig. 7.8B). An abscess usually tracks downwards along the vertebral column; it may also extend backwards towards the spinal canal, where it may interfere with the function of the spinal cord.</p>

Characteristically the bone is enlarged by a fusiform swelling which at first represents thickened and raised periosteum. Later, much of the original bone is destroyed, but at the same time new bone is laid down beneath the expanded periosteum, giving the affected metacarpal or phalanx a 'distended' appearance (Fig. 7.10). Similar changes may affect a bone of the foot, or occasionally a long bone.</p>

                            <p><strong>Investigations.</strong> Except in the case of quite small lesions the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is raised. The Mantoux test is positive. Aspirated pus is yellow and creamy: only occasionally can organisms be identified by direct examination, but culture may prove its tuberculous nature. Biopsy of affected bone or surrounding soft tissue will show the histological features of tuberculosis.</p>
                            <p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> The diagnosis can often be presumed with fair certainty from a consideration of the history, clinical features, and radiographic findings. Features that lend support are a history of contact with tuberculosis, a positive Mantoux test (particularly in children), a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and evidence of a tuberculous lesion elsewhere. The diagnosis can be proved only by identifying the causative organism or by demonstration of the typical histological features in excised fragments of tissue.</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> In most instances tuberculosis of bone is associated with infection of a joint, and the treatment is mainly that of the joint lesion (tuberculous arthritis, p. 98). The treatment of an isolated tuberculous focus in bone is along similar lines, main reliance being placed upon a combination of antituberculous drugs, usually rifampicin and isoniazid for a period of six months, as outlined on page 102. Local collections of pus should be removed by aspiration or, sometimes, by operative drainage followed by immediate suture of the wound. Resolution is indicated by improvement in the general health and weight, decrease of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and improved radiographic appearance.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>In Western countries syphilitic infection of bone is now seen only rarely, but it is still found in some parts of the world, and it is important that the possibility of its occurrence should be borne constantly in mind. Bone changes are a late manifestation of acquired syphilis, but they may appear early in life in patients with congenital syphilis. Similar bone changes may occur in yaws, a related disease seen commonly in many tropical countries.</p>
                            <p>Syphilis of bone can take many forms, but the two commonest types are syphilitic metaphysitis of infants, and osteo-periostitis (combined osteitis and periostitis) in children or adults.</p>
                            <p>Syphilitic metaphysitis presents as severe local limb pain in young infants in the first six months of life with congenital syphilis. It can affect several epiphyses, with replacement of the adjacent metaphysis by granulation tissue. These appear as a zone of sclerosis on radiographs and the Wasserman reaction is positive, though unlike osteomyelitis there is no leucocytosis. Treatment by intensive antisyphilitic drugs is rapidly effective.</p>
                            <p>Syphilitic osteo-periostitis occurs when the diaphysis or body of a bone is infected by syphilis. There is usually a combination of osteitis and periostitis, although one or other may predominate. Osteo-periostitis often occurs with metaphysitis in infants (Fig. 7.11A); it may occur separately in older children with congenital syphilis (Fig. 7.11B), or in adults with acquired syphilis.</p>

                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> Deep boring pain, worse at night, and swelling are the predominant symptoms. On examination there is either a localised fusiform swelling over the shaft of the bone or a diffuse thickening of the whole length of the bone.</p>

                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> The onset is acute or subacute, with pain and swelling of the joint. There is constitutional illness, with pyrexia.</p>
                            <p>On examination the joint is swollen, partly from fluid effusion and partly from thickening of the synovial membrane. When the affected joint is superficial, the overlying skin is warmer than normal and it is often reddened. All movements are restricted; in severe cases they are almost totally prevented by protective muscle spasm. Attempted or forced movement increases the pain. In cases of haematogenous infection a boil or other primary focus of infection is often to be found elsewhere in the body. In other cases there may be a history of penetrating injury, or of bone infection adjacent to the joint.</p>

                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> Radiographs in the early stages do not show any alteration from the normal (Fig. 7.13A), though an ultrasound scan may reveal the presence of an effusion in the affected joint which can then be aspirated to aid diagnosis (Fig. 7.13B). Later, if the infection persists, there may be diffuse rarefaction of bone adjacent to the joint, loss of cartilage space, and possibly destruction of bone. Radioisotope bone scanning shows increased uptake of the isotope in the region of the joint.</p>

                            <p><strong>Investigations.</strong> There is a polymorphonuclear leucocytosis. The C-reactive protein and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate are raised. Bacteriological examination of aspirated joint fluid usually identifies the causative organism.</p>
                            <p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> This is from other forms of arthritis (especially tuberculous arthritis, gouty arthritis, and haemophilic arthritis), and from infections near the joint (especially acute osteomyelitis).</p>
                            <p><strong>Prognosis.</strong> This varies widely according to the severity of the infection, the organism responsible, and the promptness with which efficient treatment is begun. Many joints can be saved intact, but many are destroyed more or less completely, with fibrous or bony ankylosis (Fig. 7.12).</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> Very prompt treatment is essential if there is a reasonable prospect of preserving normal joint function.</p>
                            <p>Constitutional treatment. Rest in bed may sometimes be required if a major lower limb joint is affected, together with appropriate antibiotic drugs given systemically by intravenous injection until the acute symptoms subside. Whenever possible the causative organism must be identified by culture of the blood and of joint aspirate and its sensitivity to antibiotics determined, so that the most effective drug may be given. Until that information is available treatment should be begun with broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as a third-generation cephalosporin, that have high anti-staphylococcal activity.</p>
                            <p>Local treatment. The joint is rested, usually in a plaster splint. In the case of the hip or knee, sustained weight traction is useful in relieving spasm and pain. The fluid exudate, which is often purulent, is removed by aspiration or, if necessary, by incision. Aspiration is repeated daily so long as the exudate continues to form. Rest is enforced until the infection is overcome, as shown by the subsidence of pyrexia and retrogression of the local signs. Thereafter active movements are encouraged in order to restore the greatest possible function to the joint.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>In Britain the incidence of tuberculous arthritis, formerly common, decreased markedly in the years following the Second World War, probably because of the general improvement in living standards and the introduction of streptomycin and other antituberculous drugs. Pasteurisation of milk and elimination of infected cattle have virtually abolished bovine infection. In some Asiatic and African countries tuberculous infection is still common, and cases are now seen regularly among immigrants to Britain.</p>
                            <p>Whereas formerly a joint affected by tuberculosis was nearly always destroyed, with modern treatment good recovery of function may now be expected in most patients treated early.</p>
                            <p><strong>Cause.</strong> Tuberculous arthritis is caused by infection of a joint with tubercle bacilli, human or (rarely) bovine. The infection is commonly contracted from another patient with open pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathology.</strong> No joint is immune, but the joints most often affected are the intervertebral joints of the thoracic or lumbar spine, and next in frequency the hip and knee. The organisms reach the joint through the blood stream from a focus elsewhere. The synovial membrane is much thickened (Fig. 7.14) by the tuberculous inflammatory reaction, which is of characteristic type, with round-cell infiltration and giant-cell systems. Unless the disease is arrested the articular cartilage is soon destroyed and the underlying bone is eroded. Sometimes the infection begins in bone adjacent to a joint rather than in the joint itself; thence it extends into the joint by direct continuity. The slow formation of an abscess - a 'cold' or chronic abscess in contradistinction to the florid abscess that may accompany an acute pyogenic infection - is a common feature. The abscess often makes its way towards the skin surface and may eventually rupture, giving rise to a chronic tuberculous sinus. This may provide a route for the entry of secondary infecting organisms.</p>

                                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Fig. 7.14 Tuberculous arthritis, with possible results. When infection is purely synovial there is marked thickening of the synovial membrane but the articular cartilage is intact (note similarity to early rheumatoid arthritis). With efficient treatment begun at this stage restoration to normal is possible; but if neglected the disease progresses to involve the articular cartilage and bone: the joint is destroyed, and fibrous ankylosis is the natural outcome.</figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            <p>If healing occurs before the articular cartilage and bone have been damaged the function of the joint is restored virtually to normal; but if cartilage or bone has been damaged before healing is secured permanent impairment - often complete loss of function - is inevitable (Fig. 7.15).</p>
                            <p><strong>Clinical features.</strong> Children and young adults are most commonly affected. There is often a history of contact with a patient with active pulmonary tuberculosis. In general, the predominant symptoms are pain, swelling, and impairment of function of the affected joint. There is usually some impairment of the general health. On examination the characteristic features are increased warmth of the overlying skin, swelling from synovial thickening, and painful restriction of movement in all directions. Forced movement causes sharp pain and induces protective muscle spasm. The muscles controlling the joint are usually wasted. An abscess or sinus is often apparent. A tuberculous lesion may be found elsewhere in the body.</p>

                            <p><strong>Imaging.</strong> Radiographic features. The earliest change in tuberculous arthritis is diffuse rarefaction throughout a fairly wide area of bone adjacent to the joint. If the disease is arrested early there may be no further change; but if the infection progresses the cartilage space is narrowed and the underlying bone is eroded (Fig. 7.15). As the disease heals the bones harden up again - that is, the rarefaction becomes gradually less apparent until the bone density is restored to normal.</p>

The Mantoux test is positive. Aspiration of the joint may yield a little turbid fluid, in which organisms can seldom be demonstrated, but culture may prove its tuberculous nature.

                            <p>Other complications are peculiar to special regions - for example, compression of the spinal cord by an abscess in tuberculosis of the spinal column.</p>
                            <p><strong>Course.</strong> This depends largely upon the conditions in which the patient lives, and upon the promptness with which treatment is begun and its efficiency. Under favourable conditions early treatment usually promotes gradual healing, with preservation of a useful or even a normal joint; but where conditions tend to be poor and the disease florid, the joint may be largely or totally destroyed.</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> The principles of treatment are the same no matter which joint is affected, with antibacterial drugs as the mainstay of treatment. Variations in detail will be discussed in the sections on individual joints.</p>
                            <p>Antibacterial drugs. There is now a choice of several antituberculous drugs, including rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, and ethambutol. Regimens vary: a common combination of drugs is rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide, with the addition if appropriate (depending upon the resistance of the organisms) of streptomycin or ethambutol. The course of drug treatment should continue for 6-9 months, with streptomycin or ethambutol (if used) discontinued after 2 months.</p>
                            <p>Careful watch must be kept for undesirable side effects, especially with ethambutol, which may cause optic atrophy; and with streptomycin, which may cause auditory impairment. Liver function must be monitored during treatment because rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide may be harmful to liver cells. Streptomycin carries the additional disadvantage that it has to be administered by intramuscular injection.</p>
                            <p>Local treatment varies according to the particular joint that is affected. Tuberculosis of a large joint such as the hip or knee may demand a period of rest in bed, at any rate in the early stages; whereas a patient with disease of a smaller joint - particularly in the upper limb - may be up and about throughout the period of treatment. Immobilisation of the affected joint in a plaster or splint is usually advisable in the early stages, both to relieve pain and to provide favourable conditions for healing. Splintage should generally be continued for 2 to 4 months, depending on the severity of the disease. Meanwhile abscesses should be aspirated or drained surgically.</p>
                            <p>Subsequent management depends on progress. If cartilage and bone are preserved intact and the local signs of inflammation subside, with improvement in the sedimentation rate, the outlook is good and activity may be progressively increased. If, however, the disease progresses to the point of eroding articular cartilage and underlying bone, a further period of immobilisation may be required, and fusion of the joint - usually by operation - may become the ultimate objective. In selected patients it may be feasible to undertake replacement arthroplasty of larger joints following successful antibacterial treatment. This should only be considered when the disease has been quiescent clinically for at least a year with a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate.</p>
