                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis worldwide. It occurs when the protective cartilage on the ends of your bones wears down over time.</p>
                        <p>Although osteoarthritis can damage any joint in your body, the disorder most commonly affects joints in in the hands, fingers, knees, hips and spine.</p>
                        <p>Osteoarthritis symptoms can usually be effectively managed, although the underlying process cannot be reversed. Staying active, maintaining a healthy weight and other treatments may slow progression of the disease and help improve pain and joint function</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>It is an active metabolic disorder of the articular cartilage and subchondral bone (boney plate that supports the articular cartilage) . normally, there should be a balance between the mechanical stress and the ability of the joint tissues to resist the stress. In osteoarthritis however, there is deterioration of the articular cartilage due to the physiologic imbalance between the stress applied to the joint and its ability to withstand the stress. This may result from</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Either the articular cartilage underlying the bone is normal-but excessive loads applied to the joints causing the tissues to fail or</li>
                            <li>Articular cartilage of the bone is defective and is affected even with reasonable load applied.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>whatever the cause, it results to irritation or injury to the articular cartilage, this then leads to inflammation process to repair the damage. This repair however causes reduced articular space and as more load is applied, the more it increases. The poor healing that results leads to poorly replaced tissue. This repeats itself through the persons life until the cartilage is completely lost and bones begin to rub upon each other causing the pain.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Signs and symptoms</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Pain.</strong> Your joint may hurt during or after movement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tenderness.</strong> Your joint may feel tender when you apply light pressure to it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stiffness.</strong> Joint stiffness may be most noticeable when you wake up in the morning or after a period of inactivity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Loss of flexibility.</strong> -inability to move joint through its full range of motion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Grating sensation.</strong> A grating sensation on using the joint.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone spurs.</strong> extra bits of bone, which feel like hard lumps, may form around the affected joint.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Causes/risk factors</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Older age.</strong> The risk of osteoarthritis increases with age.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sex.</strong> Women are more likely to develop osteoarthritis, though it isn't clear why.</li>
                            <li><strong>Obesity.</strong> Carrying extra body weight contributes to osteoarthritis in several ways. Increased weight puts added stress on weight-bearing joints, such as hips and knees. In addition, fat tissue produces proteins that may cause harmful inflammation in and around your joints.</li>
                            <li><strong>Joint injuries.</strong> Injuries, such as those that occur when playing sports or from an accident, may increase the risk of osteoarthritis. Even injuries that occurred many years ago and seemingly healed can increase your risk of osteoarthritis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Certain occupations.</strong> Jobs that include tasks that place repetitive stress on a particular joint, that joint may eventually develop osteoarthritis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Genetics.</strong> Some people inherit a tendency to develop osteoarthritis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone deformities.</strong> Some people are born with malformed joints or defective cartilage, which can increase the risk of osteoarthritis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Physical exam and clinical presentation</li>
                            <li>X-rays</li>
                            <li><strong>Laboratory exams - blood tests.</strong> Although there is no blood test for osteoarthritis, certain tests may help rule out other causes of joint pain, such as rheumatoid arthritis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Joint fluid analysis.</strong> - an aspiration taken from the joint is studied for inflammatory mediators.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment/management</h3>
                        <p>Currently, the process underlying osteoarthritis cannot be reversed, but symptoms can usually be effectively managed with lifestyle changes, physical and other therapies, medications, and surgery. Exercising and achieving a healthy weight are generally the most important ways to treat osteoarthritis. Your doctor may also suggest:</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Medications</h4>
                        <p>Osteoarthritis symptoms, primarily pain, may be helped by certain medications, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Acetaminophen.</strong> Acetaminophen (tylenol, others) has been shown to be effective for people with osteoarthritis who have mild to moderate pain. Taking more than the recommended dosage of acetaminophen can cause liver damage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids).</strong> Over-the-counter nsaids, including ibuprofen (advil, motrin ib, others) and naproxen sodium (aleve, others), taken at the recommended doses, typically relieve osteoarthritis pain. Stronger nsaids, available by prescription, may also slightly reduce inflammation along with relieving pain.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Nsaids can cause stomach upset, cardiovascular problems, bleeding problems, and liver and kidney damage. Topical nsaids have fewer side effects and may relieve pain just as well.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Duloxetine (cymbalta).</strong> Normally used as an antidepressant, this medication is also approved to treat chronic pain, including osteoarthritis pain.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Therapy</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Physical therapy.</strong> A physical therapist can work with you to create an individualized exercise program that will strengthen the muscles around your joint, increase your range of motion and reduce pain. Regular gentle exercise that you do on your own, such as swimming or walking, can be equally effective.</li>
                            <li><strong>Occupational therapy.</strong> An occupational therapist can help you discover ways to do everyday tasks or do your job without putting extra stress on your already painful joint. For instance, a toothbrush with a large grip could make brushing your teeth easier if you have finger osteoarthritis. A bench in your shower could help relieve the pain of standing if you have knee osteoarthritis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tai chi and yoga.</strong> These movement therapies involve gentle exercises and stretches combined with deep breathing. Many people use these therapies to reduce stress in their lives, and research suggests that tai chi and yoga may reduce osteoarthritis pain and improve movement. When led by a knowledgeable instructor, these therapies are safe. Avoid moves that cause pain in your joints.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Surgical and other procedures</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Cortisone injections-</strong> corticosteroid injected directly into the joint.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lubrication injections.</strong> Injections of hyaluronic acid may offer pain relief by providing some cushioning in your knee</li>
                            <li><strong>Realigning bones.</strong> If osteoarthritis has damaged one side of the knee more than the other, an osteotomy might be helpful. In a knee osteotomy, a surgeon cuts across the bone either above or below the knee, and then removes or adds a wedge of bone. This shifts your body weight away from the worn-out part of the knee.</li>
                            <li><strong>Joint replacement.</strong> In joint replacement surgery (arthroplasty), the surgeon removes the damaged joint surfaces and replaces them with plastic and metal parts. Surgical risks include infections and blood clots. Artificial joints can wear out or come loose and may need to eventually be replaced.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Lifestyle and home remedies</h4>
                        <p>Lifestyle changes can make a significant difference in osteoarthritis symptoms. Other home treatments also might help. Some things to try include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Exercise.</strong> Exercise can increase endurance and strengthen the muscles around the joint, making the joint more stable-walking, biking or swimming. Patient is advised to stop the practice session if they feel new joint pain</li>
                            <li><strong>Weight loss</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Use heat and cold to manage pain.</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Over the counter creams to ease pain</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Braces or shoe inserts-</strong> to immobilize the joint thus reducing the discomfort</li>
                            <li><strong>Use assistive devices.</strong> Assistive devices can make it easier to go about your day without stressing your painful joint.</li>
                        </ul>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>It is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in joints resulting in their damage. About 1 out of every 5 people who have rheumatoid arthritis get lumps on their skin called rheumatoid nodules. These often form over joint areas that receive pressure, such as over knuckles, elbows, or heels.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>After a viral or bacterial infection, the immune system of the affected patient is unable to distinguish between the pathogen and body tissues and it begins to destroy the joint tissues.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Symptoms</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pain, stiffness, and swelling in your hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, ankles, feet, jaw, and neck. Rheumatoid arthritis usually affects multiple joints.</li>
                            <li>More than one swollen joint. Usually, it's small joints in your wrists, hands, or feet.</li>
                            <li>A symmetrical pattern. When the knuckles on your left hand are inflamed, the knuckles on your right hand probably will be as well. After some time, you may notice more of your joints feel warm or become painful or swollen.</li>
                            <li>Morning stiffness than can last for hours or even most of the day. You may also feel fatigued and notice that your appetite is down and you've lost weight.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Blood test for rheumatoid arthritis</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Rheumatoid factor test:</strong> This blood test checks for a protein called rheumatoid factor. High levels of rheumatoid factor are associated with autoimmune diseases, especially RA.</li>
                            <li><strong>Anticitrullinated protein antibody test (anti-CCP):</strong>This test looks for an antibody that's associated with RA. People who have this antibody usually have the disease. However, not everyone with RA tests positive for this antibody.</li>
                            <li><strong>Antinuclear antibody test:</strong> This tests your immune system to see if it's producing antibodies. Your body may make antibodies as a response to many different types of conditions, including RA.</li>
                            <li><strong>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate:</strong> This test helps determine the degree of inflammation in your body. The result tells your doctor whether inflammation is present. However, it doesn't indicate the cause of the inflammation.</li>
                            <li><strong>C-reactive protein test:</strong> A severe infection or significant inflammation anywhere in your body can trigger your liver to make C-reactive protein. High levels of this inflammatory marker are associated with RA.</li>
                            <li><strong>Radiological exams-</strong> x-ray, ultrasound and MRI all show damage made to the joints and the extent to which it has spread.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</li>
                            <li>corticosteroids</li>
                            <li>acetaminophen</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following drugs work to slow the damage that RA can cause to your body:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs):</strong> DMARDs work by blocking your body's immune system response. This helps to slow down RA's progression.</li>
                            <li><strong>Biologics:</strong> These new generation DMARDs provide a targeted response to inflammation rather than blocking your body's entire immune system response. They may be an effective treatment for people who don't respond to treatment with more traditional DMARDs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors:</strong> These are a new subcategory of DMARDs that block certain immune responses. These are drugs that your doctor may use to help prevent inflammation and stop damage to your joints when DMARDs and biologics don't work for you.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Behavioral modifications</h3>
                        <p>Certain home remedies and lifestyle adjustments may help to improve your quality of life when living with RA:</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Exercise</h4>
                        <p>Low-impact exercises can help to improve the range of motion in thejoints and increase mobility. Exercise can also strengthen muscles, which can help to relieve some of the pressure from the joints.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Get enough rest</h4>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory condition that presents with sore joints of arthritis with psoriasis of the skin. Psoriasis causes itchy, scaly red patches to appear on your skin and scalp. Psoriasis causes patchy, raised, red and white areas of inflamed skin with scales. It usually affects the tips of the elbows and knees, the scalp, the navel, and skin around the genital areas or anus. Only about 10% to 30% of people with psoriasis will also get psoriatic arthritis.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Symptoms:</h3>
                        <p>General symptoms of PsA include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>swollen, tender joints on one or both sides of your body</li>
                            <li>morning stiffness</li>
                            <li>swollen fingers and toes</li>
                            <li>painful muscles and tendons</li>
                            <li>scaly skin patches, which may get worse when joint pain flares up</li>
                            <li>flaky scalp</li>
                            <li>fatigue</li>
                            <li>nail pitting</li>
                            <li>separation of your nail from the nail bed</li>
                            <li>eye redness (conjunctivitis)</li>
                            <li>eye pain (uveitis)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Spondylitis PsA, in particular, can also cause the following symptoms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>spinal pain and stiffness</li>
                            <li>pain, swelling, and weakness in your hips, knees, ankles, feet, elbow, hands, wrists, and other joints</li>
                            <li>swollen toes or fingers</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment</h3>
                        <p>The goal of PsA treatment is to improve symptoms like skin rash and joint inflammation. You have many different treatment options. A typical treatment plan will include one or more of the following:</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</h4>
                        <p>These medications help control joint pain and swelling. Over-the-counter (OTC) options include ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve), meloxicam .</p>
                        <p>When used incorrectly, NSAIDs can cause:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>stomach irritation</li>
                            <li>stomach bleeding</li>
                            <li>heart attack</li>
                            <li>stroke</li>
                            <li>liver and kidney damage</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)</h4>
                        <p>These medications decrease inflammation to prevent joint damage and slow the progression of PsA. You get these medicines by injection or infusion.</p>
                        <p>The most commonly prescribed DMARDs include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>methotrexate (Trexall)</li>
                            <li>leflunomide (Arava)</li>
                            <li>sulfasalazine (Azulfidine)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Apremilast (Otezla) is a newer DMARD that's taken orally. It works by blocking phosphodiesterase 4, an enzyme involved in inflammation.</p>
                        <p>DMARD side effects include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>liver damage</li>
                            <li>bone marrow suppression</li>
                            <li>lung infections</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Biologics</h4>
                        <p>Biologic drugs, also known as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors, block the effects of the protein tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This reduces inflammation and improves symptoms like stiff and swollen joints.</p>
                        <p>Commonly prescribed biologic drugs include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>adalimumab (Humira)</li>
                            <li>certolizumab (Cimzia)</li>
                            <li>golimumab (Simponi)</li>
                            <li>etanercept (Enbrel)</li>
                            <li>infliximab (Remicade)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Steroids</h4>
                        <p>These medications can bring down inflammation. For PsA, they're usually injected into affected joints. Side effects include pain and a slight risk of joint infection.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Immunosuppressants</h4>
                        <p>Medications like azathioprine (Imuran) and cyclosporine (Gengraf) calm the overactive immune response in PsA. They're not used as often now that TNF-alpha inhibitors are available. Because they weaken the immune response, immunosuppressants can increase your risk for infections.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Topical treatments</h4>
                        <p>Creams, gels, lotions, and ointments can relieve the itchy PsA rash. These treatments are available over the counter and with a prescription.</p>
                        <p>Options include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>anthralin</li>
                            <li>calcitriol or calcipotriene, which are forms of vitamin D-3</li>
                            <li>salicylic acid</li>
                            <li>steroid creams</li>
                            <li>tazarotene, which is a derivative of vitamin A</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Light therapy and other PsA medicines</h4>
                        <p>Light therapy uses medicine, followed by exposure to bright light, to treat psoriasis skin rashes.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Can lifestyle changes ease psoriatic arthritis symptoms?</h3>
                        <p>There are things you can do at home to help improve your symptoms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Add exercise to your daily routine-</strong> Keeping your joints moving can ease stiffness</li>
                            <li><strong>Break bad habits-</strong>Smoking is bad for your joints - as well as the rest of your body.</li>
                            <li><strong>Relieve stress-</strong> Tension and stress can make arthritis flares even worse.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use hot and cold packs-</strong> Warm compresses and hot packs can ease muscle soreness. Cold packs can also reduce pain in your joints.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Consider natural supplements and spices</h3>
                        <p>Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties. These healthy fats, found in many supplements, reduce inflammation and stiffness in joints.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosing psoriatic arthritis</h3>
                        <p>Presenting symptoms are seconded with imaging and blood tests to rule out gout</p>
                        <p>These imaging tests look for damage to joints and other tissues:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>X-rays.</strong> - check for inflammation and damage to bones and joints. This damage is different in PsA than it is in other types of arthritis.</li>
                            <li><strong>MRIs.</strong> Radio waves and strong magnets make images of the inside of your body.</li>
                            <li><strong>CT scans and ultrasounds.</strong> To determine how advanced PsA is and how badly joints are affected.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Blood tests for these substances help assess any inflammation present in your body:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>C-reactive protein.-</strong> produced by the liver when there's inflammation in the body.</li>
                            <li><strong>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate.</strong> This reveals how much inflammation is in the body. However, it can't determine if the inflammation is from PsA or other possible causes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rheumatoid factor (RF).</strong> This auto-antibody is produced by your immune system. It's usually present in RA but negative in PsA.</li>
                            <li><strong>Joint fluid.</strong> This test involves removal of a small amount of liquid from your knee or other joint. If uric acid crystals are in the fluid, you might have gout instead of PsA.</li>
                            <li><strong>Red blood cell.</strong> Low red blood cell count from anemia is common in people with PsA.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Risk factors for psoriatic arthritis</h3>
                        <p>You're more likely to get PsA if you:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>have psoriasis</li>
                            <li>family history of PsA</li>
                            <li>are between the ages of 30 and 50 (though children can get it, too)</li>
                            <li>have had strep throat</li>
                            <li>have HIV</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>PsA puts you at risk for complications that include:</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Gout is a kind of arthritis caused by a buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints. Uric acid is a breakdown product of purines that are part of many foods we eat. An abnormality in handling uric acid and crystallization of these compounds in joints can cause attacks of painful arthritis, kidney stones, and blockage of the kidney filtering tubules with uric acid crystals, leading to kidney failure. Gout has the unique distinction of being one of the most frequently recorded medical illnesses throughout history.</p>

                            <li><strong>Intense joint pain</strong> in the big toe, but it could also be in ankles, knees, elbows, wrists, or fingers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Discomfort:</strong> even after the sharp pain goes away, joint will still hurt.</li>
                            <li><strong>Inflammation and redness:</strong> the joint will be red, swollen, and tender.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stiffness in the joint.</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Lupus (also called SLE or systemic lupus erythematosus) is an autoimmune disease that causes the body's immune system attacks your own tissues and organs. Inflammation caused by lupus can affect many different body systems - including joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart and lungs.</p>
                        <p>Lupus can be difficult to diagnose because its signs and symptoms often mimic those of other ailments. The most distinctive sign of lupus - a facial rash that resembles the wings of a butterfly unfolding across both cheeks occurs in many but not all cases of lupus</p>
                        <p>Women of childbearing age are more likely to get lupus than men. It affects african-american women more often than white women. It usually appears between ages 15 and 44.</p>

                        <p>No one test can diagnose lupus. The combination of blood and urine tests, signs and symptoms, and physical examination findings leads to the diagnosis.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Laboratory tests</h4>
                        <p>Blood and urine tests may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Complete blood count.</strong> This test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets as well as the amount of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. Results may indicate you have anemia, which commonly occurs in lupus. A low white blood cell or platelet count may occur in lupus as well.</li>
                            <li><strong>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate.</strong> This blood test determines the rate at which red blood cells settle to the bottom of a tube in an hour. A faster than normal rate may indicate a systemic disease, such as lupus. The sedimentation rate isn't specific for any one disease. It may be elevated if you have lupus, an infection, another inflammatory condition or cancer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Kidney and liver assessment.</strong> Blood tests can assess how well your kidneys and liver are functioning. Lupus can affect these organs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Urinalysis.</strong> An examination of a sample of your urine may show an increased protein level or red blood cells in the urine, which may occur if lupus has affected your kidneys.</li>
                            <li><strong>Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test.</strong> A positive test for the presence of these antibodies - produced by your immune system - indicates a stimulated immune system. While most people with lupus have a positive ANA test, most people with a positive ANA do not have lupus. If you test positive for ANA, your doctor may advise more-specific antibody testing.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Imaging tests</h4>
                        <p>If lupus is suspected to be affecting the lungs or heart:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Chest X-ray.</strong> An image of your chest may reveal abnormal shadows that suggest fluid or inflammation in your lungs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Echocardiogram.</strong> This test uses sound waves to produce real-time images of your beating heart. It can check for problems with your valves and other portions of your heart.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Biopsy</h4>
                        <p>Kidney biopsy- FNA or by incision</p>
                        <p>Skin biopsy is sometimes performed to confirm a diagnosis of lupus affecting the skin.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment</h3>
                        <p>Treatment is depended upon the presenting symptoms. The medications most commonly used to control lupus include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</strong> Over-the-counter NSAIDs, such as naproxen sodium (Aleve) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), may be used to treat pain, swelling and fever associated with lupus. Stronger NSAIDs are available by prescription. Side effects of NSAIDs include stomach bleeding, kidney problems and an increased risk of heart problems.</li>
                            <li><strong>Antimalarial drugs.</strong> Medications commonly used to treat malaria, such as hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), affect the immune system and can help decrease the risk of lupus flares. Side effects can include stomach upset and, very rarely, damage to the retina of the eye. Regular eye exams are recommended when taking these medications.</li>
                            <li><strong>Corticosteroids.</strong> Prednisone and other types of corticosteroids can counter the inflammation of lupus. High doses of steroids such as methylprednisolone (A-Methapred, Medrol) are often used to control serious disease that involves the kidneys and brain. Side effects include weight gain, easy bruising, thinning bones (osteoporosis), high blood pressure, diabetes and increased risk of infection. The risk of side effects increases with higher doses and longer term therapy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Immunosuppressants.</strong> Drugs that suppress the immune system may be helpful in serious cases of lupus. Examples include azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate. Potential side effects may include an increased risk of infection, liver damage, decreased fertility and an increased risk of cancer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Biologics.</strong> A different type of medication, belimumab- administered intravenously, also reduces lupus symptoms in some people. Side effects include nausea, diarrhea and infections. Rarely, worsening of depression can occur.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rituximab (Rituxan)</strong> can be beneficial in cases of resistant lupus. Side effects include allergic reaction to the intravenous infusion and infections.</li>
