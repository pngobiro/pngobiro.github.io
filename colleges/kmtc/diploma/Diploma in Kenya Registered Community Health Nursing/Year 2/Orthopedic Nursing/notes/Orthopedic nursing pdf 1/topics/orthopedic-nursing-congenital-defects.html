                        <p>Clubfoot is a birth defect where one or both feet are rotated inwards and downwards. The affected foot, calf and leg may be smaller than the other. In about half of those affected, both feet are involved. The tissues connecting the muscles to the bone (tendons) are shorter than usual. It is a fairly common birth defect and is usually an isolated problem for an otherwise healthy newborn. . Without treatment, people walk on the sides of their feet, which causes problems with walking.</p>

                        <p>The exact cause is not known, but the following are suspected to be the likely causes</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Genetic predisposition</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>mutations in genes involved in muscle development are risk factors for clubfoot, specifically those encoding the muscle contractile complex</li>
                            <li>Clubfoot can also be present in people with genetic conditions such as loeys-dietz syndrome.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Gestational/pregnancy related causes</h4>
                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                            <li>Early amniocentesis (11-13 weeks)- is believed to increase the rate of clubfoot because there is an increase in potential amniotic leakage from the procedure.</li>
                            <li>Idiopathic underdevelopment of the bones and muscles of the embryonic foot</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Signs</h3>
                        <p>In clubfoot, one or both feet are rotated inwards and downwards. The affected foot, calf, and leg may be smaller than the other. In about half of those affected, both feet are involved. Most cases are not associated with other problems. Without treatment, people walk on the sides of their feet, which causes difficulty in walking</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p><strong>It is a physical deformity that is diagnosed during the first physical exam of a newborn shortly after birth.</strong></p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The following characteristics are present on an affected neonate on physical examination</strong></p>
                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                            <li>First, there is a higher arch on the inside of the foot. This component of the deformity can occur without the other aspects of clubfoot deformity. In isolation, this aspect of the deformity is called cavus deformity.</li>
                            <li>Second, the forefoot is curved inward or medially (toward the big toe). This component of the deformity can occur without the other aspects of clubfoot deformity. In isolation, this aspect of the deformity is called metatarsus adductus.</li>
                            <li>Third, the heel is turned inward. This is a natural motion of the heel and subtalar joint, typically referred to as inversion. In clubfoot deformity, the turning in (inversion) of the heel is fixed (not passively correctable) and considered a varus deformity.</li>
                            <li>Fourth, and finally, the ankle is pointed downward. This is a natural motion of the ankle referred to as plantar flexion. In clubfoot deformity, this position is fixed (not correctable) and is referred to as equinus deformity.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>A foot that shows all four components is diagnosed as having clubfoot deformity. These four components of a clubfoot deformity can be remembered with the acronym cave (cavus, forefoot adductus, varus and equinus).</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prenatal ultrasound</h4>
                        <p>sometimes it is possible to detect these deformities on ultrasound images taken during pregnancy. This early detection can be beneficial to the parents as it gives them n opportunity to make plans for proper treatment a soon as the baby is born.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Ponseti method</h4>
                        <p>This is a procedure that involves casting the foot in position for a specified period of time and later cutting the achilles tendon when the foot is rightly aligned.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The metatarsus is a group of bones in the middle section of the foot. Each foot has five metatarsal bones, each connected to the phalanges of the toes.</p>
                        <p>Metatarsus adductus refers to a condition where the metatarsal bones are turned toward the middle of the body. This causes a visible deformity, and both feet are often affected.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Causes</h3>
                        <p>The cause of metatarsus adductus is unknown. No correlation has been found with the gestational age at birth, maternal age at birth or birth order. One theory is that the condition results from the fetus being tightly packed inside the uterus during development. This could lead to abnormal posture and foot deformity.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>It's made following physical examination at birth.</p>
                        <p>The major signs of this condition include the high arch and a visibly curved and separated big toe.</p>
                        <p>A physician can assess the degree of metatarsus adductus by testing the range of motion of the foot. There are two types of this condition: flexible and nonflexible.</p>
                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                            <li><strong>flexible metatarsus adductus</strong>, the foot can be straightened up manually.</li>
                            <li><strong>nonflexible kind</strong>, the foot is stiff and doesn't return to its normal position with manual force.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management and rehabilitation</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stretching exercises may be recommended in some cases of metatarsus adductus. However, the condition goes away by itself in most children.</li>
                            <li>Treatment with casts or special shoes is occasionally needed.</li>
                            <li>Surgery is rarely necessary but can be recommended for children aged 4 or older with a severe deformity. There are various surgical procedures available to reshape the foot. All of them involve cutting certain bones (osteotomy) and then fixing them with plates or screws in a straighter position.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prognosis</h3>
                        <p>Flexible metatarsus adductus tends to persist until 1-2 years of age. In the majority of cases, the foot goes back to normal. In a small portion of cases, the foot stays moderately deformed. In rare cases, the foot continues to be stiff and deformed even after treatment. Children with metatarsus adductus are also more likely to have developmental dysplasia of the hip.</p>

                        <p>Treatment varies with age and the severity of the dysplasia. Some infants may be simply observed for a period of time to ensure the hip joints form properly.</p>

                        <p>Some infants may require treatment with a special brace called a pavlik harness. This brace is very effective and is used to position the baby's legs to encourage better formation of the hip joint. It can be used up to about 4 months of age.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Casting</h4>
                        <p>Casting is another method used to encourage proper formation of the hip joint in patients with a dislocated hip. A spica body cast is used to maintain the corrected hip position.</p>

                        <p>In some cases, surgery may be required to place the "ball" of the joint back into the "socket." The surgery may consist of correcting the ball or the socket or both, followed by spica body casting, to hold the corrected position. Sometimes there may also be tight muscles, preventing the ball from sitting in the socket. These muscles may be lengthened to allow for the ball to fit better into the socket.</p>

                        <p>It is a group of genetic conditions that results in bones that break easily. It is caused by defective genes that affect how the body makes collagen, a protein that helps strengthen bones. The condition can be mild, with only a few fractures during a person's lifetime or in more severe cases, it can involve hundreds of fractures that occur without any apparent cause.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Types of osteogenic imperfecta</h3>
                        <p><strong>Type 1</strong> is the mildest form of the condition. People who have type i oi have bone fractures during childhood and adolescence often due to minor trauma when these individuals reach adulthood, they have fewer fractures.</p>
                        <p><strong>Type 2</strong> is the most severe form of oi. Infants with type ii have bones that appear bent or crumpled and fractured before birth. Their chest is narrow and they have fractured and misshapen ribs and underdeveloped lungs. These infants have short, bowed arms and legs; hips that turn outward; and unusually soft skull bones. Most infants with type ii oi are stillborn or die shortly after birth, usually from breathing failure.</p>
                        <p><strong>Type 3</strong> Also, has relatively severe signs and symptoms. Infants with oi type iii have very soft and fragile bones that may begin to fracture before birth or in early infancy. Some infants have rib fractures that can cause lifethreatening problems with breathing. Bone abnormalities tend to get worse over time and often interfere with the ability to walk.</p>
                        <p><strong>Type 4</strong> Is the most variable form oi. Symptoms of oi type iv can range from mild to severe. About 25 percent of infants with oi type iv are born with bone fractures. Others may not have broken bones until later in childhood or adulthood. Infants with oi type iv have leg bones that are bowed at birth, but bowing usually lessens as they get older.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>Oi is often inherited from an affected parent. The diagnosis of oi is made on the basis of family history and/or clinical presentation. Other diagnostic methods that may be used include</p>
                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                            <li><strong>X-rays</strong> - findings include fractures that are at different stages of healing; an unexpected skull bone pattern called wormian bones; and bones in the spine called "codfish vertebrae."</li>
                            <li><strong>biochemical laboratory testing</strong> -involves studying collagens taken from a small skin biopsy. Changes in type i collagen are an indication of oi.</li>
                            <li><strong>DNA sequencing</strong> - used to identify the collagen gene mutation responsible for the altered collagen protein. DNA testing requires a blood sample for DNA extraction.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management and Rehabilitation</h3>
                        <p>There is currently no cure for oi. The available treatment involves supportive therapy to decrease the number of fractures and disabilities, help with independent living and maintain overall health. Oi is best managed by a medical team including the child's own doctor, and genetic, orthopedic and rehabilitation medicine. Supportive therapy is unique to each individual depending on the severity of their condition and their age.</p>
                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                            <li>Physical and occupational therapies to help improve their ability to move, to prevent fractures and to increase muscle strength are often useful.</li>
                            <li>Fractures are treated as they would be in children and adults who do not have oi.</li>
                            <li>Surgical management- intramedullary rodding (placing rods in the bones) is used to help with positioning of legs that helps with more normal functioning when necessary.</li>
                            <li>Bisphosphonate drugs- are bone strengthening drugs used to help with bone formation and to decrease the need for surgery.</li>
