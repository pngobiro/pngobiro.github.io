                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Muscular dystrophy is a group of diseases that cause progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass. In muscular dystrophy, abnormal genes (mutations) interfere with the production of proteins needed to form healthy muscle.</p>
                        <p>There are many different kinds of muscular dystrophy. Symptoms of the most common variety begin in childhood, mostly in boys. Other types don't surface until adulthood.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Risk factors</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Family history of muscular dystrophy</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Causes</h3>
                        <p>Certain genes are involved in making proteins that protect muscle fibers from damage. Muscular dystrophy occurs when one of these genes is defective. Each form of muscular dystrophy is caused by a genetic mutation particular to that type of the disease. Many of these mutations are inherited. But some occur spontaneously in the mother's ova or in the developing embryo and can be passed on to the next generation.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Symptoms</h3>
                        <p>The main sign of muscular dystrophy is progressive muscle weakness. Specific signs and symptoms begin at different ages and in different muscle groups, depending on the type of muscular dystrophy.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Duchenne type muscular dystrophy</h4>
                        <p>This is the most common form of muscular dystrophy. It's much more common in boys. About one-third don't have a family history of the disease, possibly because the gene involved may be subject to sudden abnormal change (spontaneous mutation).</p>
                        <h5>Signs and symptoms</h5>
                        <p>typically appear in early childhood and may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Frequent falls</li>
                            <li>Difficulty rising from a lying or sitting up position</li>
                            <li>Trouble running and jumping</li>
                            <li>Waddling gait</li>
                            <li>Walking on the toes</li>
                            <li>Large calf muscles</li>
                            <li>Muscle pain and stiffness</li>
                            <li>Learning disabilities</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Becker muscular dystrophy</h4>
                        <p>Signs and symptoms are similar to those of duchenne muscular dystrophy, but tend to be milder and progress more slowly. Symptoms generally begin in the teens but may not occur until the mid-20s or even later.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Other types of muscular dystrophy</h4>
                        <p>Some types of muscular dystrophy are defined by a specific feature or by where in the body symptoms first begin. Examples include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Myotonic.</strong> also known as steinert's disease, this form is characterized by an inability to relax muscles at will following contractions. Myotonic muscular dystrophy is the most common form of adult-onset muscular dystrophy. Facial and neck muscles are usually the first to be affected.</li>
                            <li><strong>Facioscapulohumeral (FSHD).</strong> muscle weakness typically begins in the face and shoulders. The shoulder blades might stick out like wings when a person with FSHD raises his or her arms. Onset usually occurs in the teenage years but may begin in childhood or as late as age 40.</li>
                            <li><strong>Congenital.</strong> this type affects boys and girls and is apparent at birth or before age 2. Some forms progress slowly and cause only mild disability, while others progress rapidly and cause severe impairment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Limb-girdle.</strong> Hip and shoulder muscles are usually the first affected. People with this type of muscular dystrophy may have difficulty lifting the front part of the foot and as a result may trip frequently. Onset usually begins in childhood or the teenage years.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                            <li><strong>Enzyme tests.</strong>- damaged muscles release enzymes, such as creatine kinase (ck), in blood. In a person who hasn't had a traumatic injury, high blood levels of ck suggest a muscle disease such as muscular dystrophy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Electromyography.</strong> An electrode needle is inserted into the muscle to be tested. Electrical activity is measured as you relax and as you gently tighten the muscle. Changes in the pattern of electrical activity can confirm a muscle disease.</li>
                            <li><strong>Genetic testing.</strong> Blood samples can be examined for mutations in some of the genes that cause different types of muscular dystrophy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Muscle biopsy.</strong> A small piece of muscle can be removed through an incision or with a hollow needle. Analysis (biopsy) of the tissue sample can distinguish muscular dystrophies from other muscle diseases.</li>
                            <li><strong>Heart-monitoring tests (electrocardiography and echocardiogram).</strong> These tests are used to check heart function, especially in people diagnosed with myotonic muscular dystrophy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lung-monitoring tests.</strong> These tests are used to check lung function</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment</h3>
                        <p>There's no cure for any form of muscular dystrophy. But treatment can help prevent or reduce problems in the joints and spine to allow people with muscular dystrophy to remain as mobile as long as possible.</p>
                        <p>Treatment options include medications, physical and occupational therapy, and surgical and other procedures.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Medications</h4>
                        <p><strong>Eteplirsen</strong> -it is an orphan drug for these condition, it works by promoting translation in the rna of muscles skipping the defective genes.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Corticosteroids,</strong> such as prednisone, which can help muscle strength and delay the progression of certain types of muscular dystrophy. But prolonged use of these types of drugs can cause weight gain and weakened bones, increasing fracture risk.</li>
                            <li><strong>Heart medications,</strong> such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors eg enalapril,lisinopril or beta blockers eg propranolol, atenolol, -if muscular dystrophy damages the heart.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Therapy</h4>
                        <p>Several types of therapy and assistive devices can improve the quality and sometimes the length of life in people who have muscular dystrophy. Examples include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Range-of-motion and stretching exercises.</strong> Muscular dystrophy can restrict the flexibility and mobility of joints. Limbs often draw inward and become fixed in that position. Range-of-motion exercises can help to keep joints as flexible as possible.</li>
                            <li><strong>Braces.</strong> Braces can help keep muscles and tendons stretched and flexible, slowing the progression of contractures. Braces can also aid mobility and function by providing support for weakened muscles.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mobility aids.</strong> Canes, walkers and wheelchairs can help maintain mobility and independence.</li>
                            <li><strong>Breathing assistance.</strong> As respiratory muscles weaken, a sleep apnea device may help improve oxygen delivery during the night. Some people with severe muscular dystrophy may need to use a machine that forces air in and out of their lungs (ventilator).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Surgery</h4>
                        <p>Surgery may be needed to correct a spinal curvature that could eventually make breathing more difficult.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Nb : preventing respiratory infections</strong><br>Respiratory infections may become a problem in later stages of muscular dystrophy. So, it's important to be vaccinated for pneumonia and to keep up to date with influenza shots. Try to avoid contact with children or adults who have an obvious infection.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Complications</h3>
                        <p>The complications of progressive muscle weakness include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Trouble walking.</strong> Some people with muscular dystrophy eventually need to use a wheelchair.</li>
                            <li><strong>Shortening of muscles or tendons around joints (contractures).</strong> Contractures can further limit mobility.</li>
                            <li><strong>Breathing problems.</strong> Progressive weakness can affect the muscles associated with breathing. People with muscular dystrophy may eventually need to use a breathing assistance device (ventilator), initially at night but possibly also during the day.</li>
                            <li><strong>Curved spine (scoliosis).</strong> Weakened muscles may be unable to hold the spine straight.</li>
                            <li><strong>Heart problems.</strong> Muscular dystrophy can reduce the efficiency of the heart muscle.</li>
                            <li><strong>Swallowing problems.</strong> If the muscles involved with swallowing are affected, nutritional problems and aspiration pneumonia may develop. Feeding tubes may be an option.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>The primary defect in Osteomalacia is deficiency of activated vitamin d(calcitriol) which promotes calcium absorption from the git. As a result, the supply of calcium and phosphate in the extracellular is low.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Vitamin d also facilitates the movement of calcium and phosphates to the calcification cites in the bones.</p>
                        <ol start="2">
                            <li>Disease processes that cause malabsorption syndrome or that which results in excessive loss of calcium from the body also result in Osteomalacia. For example, diseases like celiac disease that cause reduced absorption of fats secondarily lead to non-absorption of fat soluble vitamins like vit d and thus cause its deficiency</li>
                            <li>Hyperparathyroidism also leads to decalcification of bones.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Signs</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A dull aching pain that may spread from the hips to the limbs, ribs and lower back</li>
                            <li>Irregular heart rhythms</li>
                            <li>Numbness in the hands, mouth and feet.</li>
                            <li>Frequent fractures</li>
                            <li>Bowed legs</li>

                        <p>management begins by identifying the cause of calcium and vitamin d deficiency. When cause is found and treated there is improvement in the patients well being</p>

                            <li>Malabsorption - increase the amount of vit d intake</li>
                            <li>Exposure to sunlight to help activate vitamin d</li>
                            <li>Poor diet is corrected by changing to a healthy diet</li>

                        <p>It is a localized rapid bone turnover mostly affecting the skull, femur, tibia, pelvic bones, and vertebrae.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>There is a primary proliferation of osteoclasts which produce bone resorption. This is followed by a compensatory increase in osteoblastic activity that replaces the bone. As bone turnover continues, a classic mosaic (disorganized) pattern of bone develops.</p>
                        <p>Due to the disease process and changes taking place, the bone becomes highly vascularized and structurally weak. Pathological fractures occur. Structural bowing of legs begins causing malalignment of the hip, knee, and ankle joints leading to development or arthritis, back and joint pains.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical manifestations</h3>
                        <p>It is an asymptomatic disease. Patients may not report of pain but the re is visible deformity. Most diagnoses are made following a routine physical exam with x-rays that may reveal the various deformities.</p>
                        <p>However, some may present with the following symptoms and signs</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pain in the back, bones, hip, joints, or neck</li>
                            <li>bone deformities-eg bowed legs,</li>
