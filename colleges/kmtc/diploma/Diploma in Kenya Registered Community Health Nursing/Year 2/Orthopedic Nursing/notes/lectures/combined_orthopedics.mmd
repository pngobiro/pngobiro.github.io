INTRODUCTION \\ TO \\ ORTHOPAEDICS
}

PRESENTED BY:
PROF. J.A.O. MULIMBA

\section*{2. Introduction: What is Orthopaedics.}
- This is the study of the locomotor system.
- Historically was derived from Greek meaning straight child.
- Term coined by Andre in 1741.

\section*{3. The scope of locomotor system:}
- Bones
- Joints
- Muscles and Tendons
- Ligaments
- Bursae
- Nerves
- Blood Vessels.

\section*{4. Have Orthopaedic and Orthopaedic Trauma}
- Orthopaedics: Derangements of the locomotor system.
- Orthopaedic Trauma: Injury of the locomotor system.

\section*{5. Scope of orthopaedics:}
- Congenital disorders.
- Developmental disorders
- Genetic disorders- e.g Blood, storage disorder.
- Inflammatory - infective -e.g. Osteomyelitis.
- None infective - e.g. Rheumatoid Arthritis

MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES
}
D.Yegon

\section*{MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES}
- Are traumatic events due to
a) Fractures
b) Dislocation
c) Associated soft tissues injuries
- A contusion is a soft tissue injury produced by blunt force, such as a blow, kick, or fall.
- Many small blood vessels rupture and bleed into soft tissues (ecchymosis, or bruising).
- A hematoma develops when the bleeding is sufficient to cause an appreciable collection of blood.
- Local symptoms (pain, swelling, and discoloration) are controlled with intermittent application of cold. Most contusions resolve in 1 to 2 weeks.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-04.jpg?height=1075&width=1847&top_left_y=282&top_left_x=282)
- A strain is a "muscle pull" caused by overuse, overstretching, or excessive stress.
- The C/M of strain and sprain are similar i.e. pain, edema, decreased function and contution.
- The patient experiences soreness or sudden pain, with local tenderness on muscle use and isometric contraction.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-05.jpg?height=817&width=2042&top_left_y=1049&top_left_x=325)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-06.jpg?height=1353&width=2063&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=177)
- A sprain is an injury to the ligaments surrounding a joint that is caused by a wrenching or twisting motion.
- The function of a ligament is to maintain stability while permitting mobility.
-1 st degree - stretched
$-2^{\text {nd }}$ degree - partially torn
$-3^{\text {rd }}$ degree - completely torn
- An x-ray should be obtained to rule out bone injury.
- Avulsion fracture (in which a bone fragment is pulled away by a ligament or tendon) may be associated with a sprain.
- Most common are the fingers wrist, ankle, and knee
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-08.jpg?height=1129&width=2108&top_left_y=220&top_left_x=176)

\section*{Management}
- Treatment of contusions, strains, and sprains consists of;
- stop activity and limiting movement.
- elevating the affected part
-applying cold
- compression bandage.
-Analgesia if needed.

\section*{DISLOCATIONS}
- When the bones at a joint are no longer in proper contact.
- Can be caused by severe twisting or indirect force, or even a muscular contraction
- Most frequently dislocated joints
-Shoulder
-Elbow
- Thumb
- Finger
-Jaw
-Knee

Shoulder Dislocation
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-10.jpg?height=855&width=786&top_left_y=963&top_left_x=739)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-10.jpg?height=830&width=869&top_left_y=988&top_left_x=1517)

\section*{Signs and Symptoms of a Dislocation}
- Deformity or abnormal appearance
- Pain and tenderness aggravated by movement
- Loss of normal function
- Joint may be locked in one position
- Swelling of the joint

\section*{General Treatment Principles}
- Stop the activity.
- Survey the injured area.
- First Aid if qualified.
- Get help if not.
- Determine if additional medical attention is necessary.
- Reduction under anaesthesia
- Immobilization is done by splinting or bandaging
- Physiotherapy
- Pain management.

\section*{FRACTURES}
- A fracture is condition in which there is a break in the continuity of the bone.
- It can occur as a result of high force impact or stress.

\section*{Etiology/predisposing factors}
- Trauma. A fall, a motor vehicle accident, or a tackle during a football game can all result in fractures.
- Osteoporosis. This disorder weakens bones and makes them more likely to break. Leading to pathological fractures.
- Overuse. Repetitive motion can tire muscles and place more force on bone. This can result in stress fractures. Stress fractures are more common in athletes.
- Treatment modalities- some drugs used cause demineralization of the bones

\section*{Clinical features}
- Local trauma
- Deformity
- Pain
- Erythema
- Loss of function
- Impaired mobility
- crepitus

\section*{Types of fractures}

Complete fractures - this involves a break across the entire cross-section of the bone. They are frequently displaced that is removed from the normal position. Examples;
$\checkmark$ Comminuted fracture - this is the bone fracture which produces several bone fragments.
$\checkmark$ Linear fracture - it is a break that is parallel to the bone's long axis
$\checkmark$ Transverse fracture - it is a break at right angle to the bone's long axis

\section*{Transverse Fracture}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-16.jpg?height=1483&width=2121&top_left_y=239&top_left_x=137)

\section*{Simple fracture}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-17.jpg?height=1191&width=368&top_left_y=425&top_left_x=352)

Comminuted fracture
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-17.jpg?height=1178&width=355&top_left_y=425&top_left_x=1060)

\section*{Open fracture}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-17.jpg?height=1178&width=362&top_left_y=425&top_left_x=1694)
*ADAM.
$\checkmark$ Oblique fracture - it is a fracture that is diagonal to a bone's long axis
$\checkmark$ Spiral fracture - it is a fracture where at least one part of the bone is being twisted
$\checkmark$ Multiple Fracture- where there are three or more fracture fragments in a single bone. The fracture lines are not interconnect. The fracture lines may be of any shape. These are two or more completely independent fractures affecting the same bone, e.g oblique fracture of proximal and distal femur
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-19.jpg?height=1413&width=2485&top_left_y=94&top_left_x=1)

Multiple Fracture
Spiral fracture of femur

\section*{Fibula}

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-20.jpg?height=1650&width=515&top_left_y=157&top_left_x=1726)
$\checkmark$ Impacted fracture - it is a break caused when bone fragments are driven into another bone fragment
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-21.jpg?height=1301&width=1441&top_left_y=546&top_left_x=468)

Incomplete fractures- An incomplete fracture implies that a bone has not completely lost continuity; some portion of the bone remains intact. There are several types of incomplete fractures, examples;
- Avulsion Fracture- A separation of a small bone fragment from the bone where a tendon or ligament is attached.
- Articular fracture- Involves a joint surface. Articular is cartilage at the end of the long bones where bones articulate, or meet.
- Greenstick fracture - it is a fracture in which one side of bone is broken and the other side is bent
- Fissure Fracture- Cracks or fissure lines will occur when direct trauma is applied to any long or flat bone.
- Depression Fracture-Depression fractures represent areas in which multiple fissure fracture lines intersect. The fragments of the bone are driven inwards.
- Hairline fracture. A very thin crack or break in the bone
- Stress fracture. Fracture caused by repetitive stress to/azbone
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-24.jpg?height=1253&width=1996&top_left_y=181&top_left_x=264)

\section*{Depression fracture}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-25.jpg?height=1127&width=2418&top_left_y=425&top_left_x=79)

An open fracture -it is also refered to as compound or complex. It is the one in which the skin or mucous membrane wound extend to the fractured bone or fractured hematoma is exposed. It is categorized in the following way:
i. Grade1 -clean wound less than 1 cm long
ii.Grade 2 -large wound without extensive soft tissue damaged
iii.Grade3 -highly contaminated, has extensive soft tissue damaged which is most severe

Avulsion-a pulling away of a frogment of bone by a ligament or tendon and its attachment
Closed-a frocture that remains contained; does not break the skin Comminuted-a frocture in which bone has splintered into several fragments
Compression-a fracture in which bone has been compressed (seen in vertebral froctures)
Depressed-a frocture in which frogments are driven inward (seen frequently in fractures of the skull and facial bones)
Epiphyseal-a frocture through the epiphysis
Greenstick-a fracture in which one side of a bone is broken and the other slide is bent

Impocted-a fracture in which a bone fragment is driven into another bone frogment
Oblique-a fracture occurring at an angle across the bone fless stable than transverse]
Open-a frocture in which damoge also inwolves the skin or mucous membranes
Pathologic-a frocture that occurs through an area of diseased bone (bone cyst, Poget's disease, bony metastasis, fumor); can occur without trauma or a fall
Spiral-a fracture twisting around the shaft of the bone
Transverse-of frocture that is straight across the bone

\section*{Diagnosis}

History taking
X-rays
CT scan
MRI

\section*{Emergency/casualty management First Aid principles with fractures}
- Good first aid care of fractures is always important. First aid for fractures is all about immobilizing (limiting movement) the injury.
- Abnormal movement of the broken bones can increase pain and bleeding and cause damage of the tissues around the injury.
- This can lead to complications in the repair and healing of the injury later on.
- Splints can be purpose made or makeshift but will be effective if the injury is immobilized above and below the break to stop movement.

Any external bleeding should be controlled.
- Complicated breaks where a limb is very deformed may need to be realigned before splinting and this is best done only by paramedics or medical staff.
- Other fractures of the body such as skull, ribs and the pelvis are all serious and should be managed by paramedics.

\section*{Management of fractures}
- The principles of fracture treatment include
-Reduction
-Immobilization
-Rehabilitation

\section*{REDUCTION}
- Reduction of a fracture ("setting" the bone) refers to restoration of the fracture fragments to anatomic alignment and rotation.
- Either closed reduction or open reduction may be used to reduce a fracture

\section*{Closed Reduction.}
- Closed reduction is accomplished by bringing the bone fragments into apposition (i.e, placing the ends in contact) through manipulation and manual traction.
- The extremity is held in the desired position, length and alignment while the physician applies a cast, splint, or other device. Reduction under anesthesia.
- The immobilizing device maintains the reduction and stabilizes the extremity for bone healing.
- X-rays are obtained to verify that the bone fragments are correctly aligned.
- Traction (skin or skeletal) may be used to effect fracture reduction and immobilization.
- Traction-is the application of a pulling force to an injured or diseased part of the body or an extremity while Countertraction pulls in the opposite direction.
- Two types skin and skeletal traction.

\section*{Indications}

To reduce, align, and immobilize fractures
To minimize muscle spasms
Reduce bone deformity
Increase space between opposing forces(for orthopedic procedures)

NB ; traction is used as a shorter intervention until other'treatment modalities are possible

\section*{used to}
- prevent or reduce pain and muscle spasm associated with lowback pain or cervical sprain (e.g., whiplash),
- immobilize a joint or part of the body,
- reduce a fracture or dislocation, and
- treat a pathologic joint condition (e.g., tumor, infection).

\section*{Principles of effective traction}

Counter-traction- whenever traction is applied, counter-traction must be used to achieve effective traction

Skeletal traction is never interrupted
Weights are never removed unless intermittent traction is prescribed

Maintain the line of pull
The patient must be in good body alignment in the Centre of the bed

Ropes must be unobstructed in straight alignment

Weights must hang freely and not rest on the bed or floor

Knots on the rope must not touch the pulley or the foot of the bed

Skin traction- this is traction applied through the skin. Skin traction is generally less desirable due to the fact that skin can be injured when pressure is applied for extended periods of time.
* It works by applying weight to tape, sponge rubber, or canvas materials which have been attached to the skin surrounding the damaged body structure.
- The amount of weight which can be applied to skin traction is limited to the tolerance of the
- Skin traction is used for the control of muscle spasm and to provide immobilization, in theatre during the procedure.
- If prolonged or heavy traction weight is needed then skeletal traction is usually used rather than skin traction.
- Traction must be applied in the direction and magnitude to obtain its desired effect. As soft tissue and muscle relax, the amount of weight required may change to maintain the desired pulling force.
- When traction is applied counter-traction needs to be considered. Counter-traction is force acting in the opposite direction; it is achieved by elevating the foot of
- Indication of skin traction

\section*{Children}

Temporary traction - only a few days e.g. Preoperative
Small force required to maintain reduction $<5 \mathrm{~kg}$
- Contraindication of skin traction
- Force required > 5kg
- Skin damage or sepsis in area e.g. if the skin has abrasions, lacerations, dermatitis, impaired circulation, burns etc
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-43.jpg?height=1529&width=2278&top_left_y=122&top_left_x=156)

\section*{Factors to consider when applying skin traction}
- Any factor which might reduce the pull or alter the line of pull must be eliminated.
- Skin should be assessed for abrasions and circulatory problems before the application of skin traction, as it must be in a healthy condition to tolerate the traction.
- The patient should be in good body alignment in the middle of the bed.
- Ropes and weights must be unobstructed.
- Knots in the rope or footplate must not touch the putlley or the foot of the bed. ${ }^{\text {pail.com }}$

\section*{Types of skin traction}
- Buck's extension traction- is a form of traction where pull is exerted in one plane.
- It is used when partial or temporary immobilization is required, and it is used to provide comfort following injury while awaiting surgical fixation, especially in hip and femur injuries.
- To apply Buck's traction, foam rubber padded straps are placed with the foam surface against the skin on each side of the affected leg.
- A loop of tape is extended beyond the sole of the foot, and a spreader is applied to the distal end of the tape which prevents pressure along the side of the foot.
- The malleolus and proximal fibula are protected with cast padding; this prevents pressuriesores and skin necrosis
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-46.jpg?height=1411&width=2393&top_left_y=12&top_left_x=76)
(A) Applying elastic bandage for Buck's extension traction. (B) Prepadded boot that ${ }^{2}$ may be used in Buck's extension.
- Russell's traction- it is used to stabilize fractured femurs and fractures of the tibial plateau until cell forms. It works by supporting the flexed knee in a sling and applying a horizontal pulling force by use of traction tape and elastic bandage attached to the lower leg.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-47.jpg?height=1152&width=2171&top_left_y=690&top_left_x=177)

- Dunlop's Traction - used to treat muscle or nerve irritation of shoulders or upper arms. It works in the form of horizontal traction which is applied to the abducted humerous, while vertical traction is applied to the flexed forearm.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-49.jpg?height=1076&width=2116&top_left_y=731&top_left_x=192)

\section*{Cont,,,}
- Bryant's traction or Gallow's traction- used for fracture shaft of femur in children less than 2 years of age. If used in older (more than 2 years) children it causes vascular complication.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-51.jpg?height=1352&width=2464&top_left_y=28&top_left_x=0)

Bryant's traction

\section*{Nursing care for a patient on traction}
- Ensure that traction is effective
- Maintain counter-traction
- Avoid wrinkling and slipping of the traction bandage
- Ensure proper positioning of patient i.e. with good body alignment in the middle of the bed, must be maintained to keep the affected limb in a neutral position.
- Reassure the patient to alleviate anxiety.
- Nursing assessment- The body part placed on traction should be assessed for color, temperature, edema, pulse, sensation, movability and skin integrity.

\section*{Complication of skin traction}
- Skin breakdown
- Nerve pressure
- Circulatory impairment

Skeletal traction- is applied by use of metal pins, wires, or screws that inserted through the bone distal to the fracture. This allows for longer traction time and heavier weights ( $7-12 \mathrm{kgs}$ ) to aid in bone realignment.
- Indications Skeletal Traction

Adults requiring > 5kg traction
Skin damage requiring dressings
Long term traction required

\section*{Types of skeletal tractions}
- Halo traction: To stabilize fractures or displaced vertebrae in cervical and thoracic areas. This is usually always used in adults with broken necks if surgery is not performed immediately post injury.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-55.jpg?height=1104&width=1267&top_left_y=768&top_left_x=636)
a)Balanced suspension traction- suspends and immobilizes a leg without applying traction to the body. May be applied to hip, tibia, fibula or femur. The leg is supported by a Pearson attachment and a Thomas splint. A Thomas splint is a padded ring that fits around the upper leg while the Pearson attachment meets the Thomas splint at the knee and supports the lower leg. A canvas sling may be used to further support the lower leg. Balanced suspension traction is used to stabilize fractures of the femur and requires an invasive procedure in which pins, screws or wires are surgically installed. Weights used in skeletal traction generally range from 25-40lbs (11-18kg) yegondomkips@gmail.com
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-57.jpg?height=1398&width=2474&top_left_y=41&top_left_x=14)

Balanced skeletal traction using (A) Thomas leg splint and Pearson attachment, and (B) slings for support and suspension.
- Femoral traction 90/90- most commonly used traction for complicated fractures of the femur. A pin or wire is applied through the distal femur; the lower leg may be casted. The thigh is suspended in the vertical plane by weight traction pulling vertically upwards. The ill effect of gravity as the cause of backward angulation of the fragments is thus eliminated. Most effective in children older than 6 yea

A reduction of pressure inside the discs (decompression) aids in pulling nutrients, oxygen and moisture back into the disc.

\section*{- Nursing care of a patient on skeletal traction}
a) Maintain effective traction by ensuring that the ropes are in the wheel grooves of the pulley and that the weights hang freely
b) Maintain alignment and position
c) Prevent skin breakdown by assessing pressure areas
d) Monitor neurovascular status
e) Provide pin site care to maintain muscle strength, tone, prevent infection and promote circulation

\section*{Complications}
- Pressure ulcers
- Pneumonia
- DVT
- Constipation and anorexia
- Infection.

\section*{Open Reduction.}
- Some fractures require open reduction. Through a surgical approach, the fracture fragments are reduced.
- Internal fixation devices (metallic pins, wires, screws, plates, nails, or rods) may be used to hold the bone fragments in position until solid bone healing occurs.
- These devices may be attached to the sides of bone, or they may be inserted through the bony fragments or directly into the medullary cavity of the bone.
- Internal fixation devices ensure firm approximation and 2 fixation of the bony fragments.

\section*{External Fixation}

In this type of operation, metal pins or screws are placed into the broken bone above and below the fracture site. The pins or screws are connected to a metal bar outside the skin. This device is a stabilizing frame that holds the bones in the proper position while they healegondomk

\section*{IMMOBILIZATION}
- After the fracture has been reduced, the bone fragments must be immobilized, or held in correct position and alignment, until union occurs.
- Immobilization may be accomplished by external or internal fixation.
- Methods of external fixation include bandages, casts, splints, continuous traction, and external fixators.
- Metal implants used for internal fixation serve as internal splints to immobilize the fracture.
- Cast Immobilization- A plaster or fiberglass cast is the most common type of fracture treatment, because most broken bones can heal successfully once they have been re-positioned and a cast has been applied to keep the broken ends in proper position while they heal.
- Functional Cast or Brace- The cast or brace allows limited or "controlled" movement of nearby joints. This treatment is desirable for some, but not all, fractures.

\section*{MAINTAINING AND RESTORING FUNCTION}
- Reduction and immobilization are maintained as prescribed to promote bone and soft tissue healing.
- Swelling is controlled by elevating the injured extremity and applying ice as prescribed.
- Neurovascular status (circulation, movement, sensation) is monitored, and the orthopedic surgeon is notified immediately if signs of neurovascular compromise are identified.
- Restlessness, anxiety, and discomfort are controlled with a variety of approaches, such as reassurance, position changes, and pain relief strategies, including use of analgesics mail.com
- Isometric and muscle-setting exercises are encouraged to minimize disuse atrophy and to promote circulation.
- Participation in activities of daily living (ADLs) is encouraged to promote independent functioning and self-esteem

Factors That Enhance Fracture Healing
- Immobilization of fracture fragments
- Maximum bone fragment contact
- Sufficient blood supply
- Proper nutrition
- Exercise: weight bearing for long bones
- Hormones: growth hormone, thyroid, calcitonin, vitamin D, anabolic steroids

\section*{Factors That Inhibit Fracture Healing}
- Extensive local trauma and bone loss
- Inadequate immobilization
- Space or tissue between bone fragments
- Infection or local malignancy
- Metabolic bone disease (e.g. osteoporosis)
- Avascular necrosis
- Intra-articular fracture (synovial fluid contains fibrolysins, which lyse the initial clot and retard clot formation)
- Age (elderly persons heal more slowly)
- Corticosteroids (inhibit the repair rate)

\section*{Complications of fractures}
visceral injury. 1
vascular injury. 2
compartment syndrome. 3
nerve injury. 4
infections . 5
hemarthrosis. 6
- There is no accepted time for a complication to be considered 'early', but the term is usually applied to complications that occur during the acute phase of treatment.

\section*{1. Visceral Injury:}

Fractures around the trunk are often complicated by visceral injury.
E.g. Rib fractures are associated with life threatening pneumothorax or with spleen, liver injuries.
E.g. Pelvic injuries are associated with bladder or urethral rupture and cause sever hematoma in the retroperitoneum .
Surgery of visceral injuries should take precedence over the treatment of fracture.

\section*{2. Vascular Injuries:}

Most associated with injuries around knee, elbow, humerus and femoral shaft.
Commonly associated with high-energy open fractures.
They are rare but well-recognized.
Cause : From initial trauma or from bone fragment Mechanism of injuries:
** The artery may be cut or torn.
** Compressed by the fragment of bone.
** normal appearance with intimal detachment that lead to thrombus formation.
** segment of artery may be in spasm.

\section*{Clinical features :}

Classical presentation of ischemia 6 Ps:
Pain , Pallor, Pulseless , Paralysis , and
Paraesthesia and Positive passive stretch test X-ray: suggest high-risk fracture.
Angiogram should be performed to confirm diagnosis.

Fractures commonly associated with vascular injury.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Vessel & Injury \\
\hline subclavian & $1^{\text {st }}$ rib fracture \\
\hline Axillary & Shoulder dislocation \\
\hline Brachial & \begin{tabular}{l}

\hline Popliteal & Knee dislocation \\
\hline Popliteal or its & yeqondomks Promicơimal tibial fracture \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Management}

This is an emergency because the effect of ischemia especially on the muscle is irreversible after 6 hours.
1. Temporary vascular shunt to perfuse distal limb.
2. Skeletal stabilization - temporary external fixation often used.
3. Definitive vascular repair.
4. Staged definitive skeletal internal fixation if required.
3. Nerve injury:

It's more common than arterial injuries.
- The most commonly injured nerve is the
radial nerve in its groove or in the lower third of the upper arm especially in oblique fracture of the humerus.
- Common with humerus, elbow and knee fractures
- Most nerve injuries are due to tension neuropraxia.

\section*{Closed Injuries}
The nerve is rarely severely affected (just neuropraxia or axontmesis) and spontaneous recovery is usually the role.
- If not; the nerve should be explored because it sometimes trapped between the fragment and occasionally it is found to be divided and more likely to be completely injured.
And should be explored during wound debridement or in 2nd operation.

\section*{Open Injuries}
- A complete lesion(neurotmesis) is more likely, the nerve is explored during wound debridement and repaired, either then or 3weeks later by nerve suturing and grafting.

\hline nerve & Injury \\
\hline Axillary & 1. Shoulder dislocation \\
\hline Radial & 2. Humeral shaft fracture \\

\section*{4.Compartment syndrome: :}

Most commonly in forearm and calfs.
Muscles are arranged in different compartments and surrounded by one fascia , this arrangement called osteofascial compartment.
Compartment syndrome occurs when muscle swells within osteofacial compartment and occludes its blood supply >> infarction and late ischemic contracture.
Trauma is the most common cause. Reasons that lead to increase the pressure inside:
1. Bleeding
2. Edema
3. Infection
- Fracture of the arm and leg can give rise to severe ischemia even if there is no damage to major vessel.
- Bleeding or edema will increase the pressure within one of the osteofascial compartments, this lead to decrease in capillary blood flow which in turn leads to muscle ischemia, further edema, still greater pressure, and yet more profound ischemia....vicious circle.
- After 12 hours or less, this vicious circle ends in necrosis of nerves and muscles within the compartment.
- Nerves are capable of regeneration, but the muscle once infarcted can never recover and are replaced by fibrous tissue. This condition is called volkmann's ischemic contracture.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-93.jpg?height=1673&width=2303&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=60)
- Distal pulses and neurological functions are normal until very late.
Muscle will be dead after 4-6 hrs of total ischemia so there is no time to lose!

\section*{When do we have to suspect compartment} syndrome?
1. High-risk injuries-fracture of the elbow
- fracture of the forearm
- fracture of the proximal
third of the tibia
2.Predisposing factor: operation ( internal fixation), infection.
3.Classical feature of ischemia ( 5 ps )
4. very painful, swollen, tense limb.

Don't wait for the obvious sings of ischemia to appear. If you suspect An impending compartment syndrome, start treatment straightaway

\section*{Cont..}
5. the muscle should be tested by stretching; if the pain increase then this goes with compartment syndrome.
6. In doubtful cases, the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the compartment pressure by using a catheter which is introduced into the compartment close to the level of fracture.
$\square$ A differential pressure (the difference between diastolic and compartment pressure) of less than $\mathbf{3 0 m m H g}$ is an indication for immediate decompression

\section*{Ireatment:}
1. Decompression ....by Immediate open fasciotomy (open all compartment through medial and lateral incisions) and left open for 2 days
2. If there is muscle necrosis , debridement can be done
3.if tissue is healthy the wound can be sutured, or skin-grafted. or the wound is left to heal by secondary intention
4. Limb should be examined every 15 min for 2 hours if there is no improvement, or if the pressure falls below 30 ...

\section*{5. Haemarthrosis}
*Bleeding into a joint spaces.
*Occurs if a joint is involved in the fracture.
Presentation:
swollen tense joint; the patient resists any attempt to moving it.

\section*{Treatment :}
blood aspiration before dealing with the fracture; to prevent the development of synovial adhesions.

\section*{6. Infection:}
*usually seen in open fractures; rarely with closed fractures unless opened by operation (ex; internal fixation).
*Open fracture in 6 hrs the risk of infection increases up to $10 x$.
*All open fracture should be treated by prophylactic antibiotics ,
*appropriate early management; wound excision and debridement, skeletal stabilization and wound closure. *Post-traumatic bone infection is the most common cause of chronic osteomyelitis *Infection may be early within days after surgery or late ${ }^{06 / 1 / 12025}$ Occurring months after surgery

\section*{Musculoskeletal pain syndrome}
- Poorly localized pain in the extremities that is excessively dysproportionate to the lab and physical findings
- May develop in children with underlying rheumatic disease or post-trauma
- It is associated with sleep disorders, chronic fatigue and poor school attendance, depression with normal

\section*{Musculoskeletal pain syndrome}
- The diagnosis is to exclude other diseases via various tests depending on the presentation
- Treatment involves getting to the bottom of the underlying psychiatric disorder , behavioral therapy, exercise and judicious analgesia

\section*{Clinical manifestations}
- History of pain but no tenderness on clinical exam
- Inconsistency of the details
- Pain varies from place to place
- Poor response to NSAIDs and other analgesics
- Fatigue, sleep disorders poor school attendance
- Depressed moods
- Laboratory findings non specific

\section*{Diagnosis and Treatment}
- Is a diagnosis of exclusion depending on presentation
- Treatment involves identification of underlying psychiatric or psychological problem
- Emotional support, fitness program, anti depressants

\section*{Fibromyalgia}
- Is an MSPS with multiple discrete tender points and sleep disturbance.
- Affects children and adolescents
- Pain affected by activity, anxiety, stress and weather
- The feature is widespread musculoskeletal pain with multiple tender points and other features- fatigue, arthralgia, joint stiffness, skin tenderness,

\section*{Fibromyalgia}
- Post-exertional pains , irritable bowel, poor memory, tension headaches, dizziness, restless legs, fluid retention, Raynauds, paraesthesia,
- It affects quality of life and performance of given tasks
- It is thought that the pain results from changes to the central nervous system

\section*{Fibromyalgia}
- The neurochemical pathology causes the body to become sensitised so that pain is experienced even on mild touch or pressure
- This pain is affected by the psychiatric/ psychological state of the patient
- This condition grouped together with other Central sensitivity syndromes (CSS) like migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, restless leg syndrome, primary dysmenorrhea etc

\section*{Fibromyalgia}
- Pain at well defined tender points on thumb point palpation - occiput, low cervical , trapezius, supraspinatus, $2^{\text {nd }}$ rib, lat epicondyle of humerus, gluteal, greater trochanter, knee,
- On palpation there is pain but features of inflammation eg heat, swelling and redness absent

\section*{Fibromyalgia}
- All lab and imaging tests are normal
- The treatment approach is multidisciplinary
- Goals: reduce pain and depression and improve sleep and physical activity
- Pharmacological approach: include muscle relaxants, tricyclic anti depressants, SSRIs, usually in combination with NSAIDs and non

\section*{Fibromyalgia}
- Exercise/activity/ physiotherapy nonimpact aerobic activity improves fitness and CVS health
- Psychotherapy - reduces levels of anxiety and depression and improves well being
- Patient support- child and family support is important
- Others-hypnotherapy , TENS

\section*{Complex regional pain syndrome (reflex sympathetic dystrophy) (CRPS)}
- A condition of unknown cause characterised by diffuse limb pain with colour and temperature changes resulting from autonomic nervous dysfunction
- CRPS type I require causation by an initiating noxious event eg crush, soft tissue injury or tight cast
- CRPS type II is characterised by presence of a defined nerve injury

\section*{CRPS}
- In both cases there is pain, allodynia or hyperalgesia that is dysproportionate to the initiating event
- In the course of the syndrome there is edema, skin blood flow changes revealed by colour changes and skin temperature changes of >1.1 degrees celcius from homologous part of the body

\section*{CRPS}
- Thought to result from persistence of noxious stimuli from an injured part leading to peripheral and central sensitisation.
- Primary afferent nociceptive mechanisms demonstrate abnormally heightened sensation with spontaneous pain and hyperalgesia

\section*{CRPS}
- No diagnostic tests identify CRPS
- Type I symptoms often begin immediately -weeks after an injury usually in a distal extremity. Usually one limb involved but rarely multiple
- They have spontaneous pain, difficulty in using affected limb, neglect-like symptoms, altered skin temperature, rapid fatiguability

\section*{CRPS}
- Physical exams - impaired motor functions, limited range of movement, dystonia, musclespasms, hypoesthesia, allodynia, anesthesia dolorosa, abnormal sweating, edema, altered skin colour and temperature, atrophy, hypotrichosis and altered nail growth

\section*{CRPS}
- Blood tests usually normal
- EMG and NCS may reveal presence of nerve injury, CRPS II, or rule out other DDx
- Vascular studies considered
- Muscle and nerve biopsies may show decrease in type 1 fibres, increased lipofucsin, fibre atrophy, abnormal afferent nerve fibres

\section*{CRPS}
- Pharmacological treatment:
- Corticosteroids[ beneficial in short term but not so useful in chronic management
- Calcium regulating drugs: calcitonin, clodronate and aledronate have reduced pain, swelling, movement
- Opioids: role not clear but usually prescribed
- NSAIDs; not been investigated for it but may be used in mild pain

\section*{CRPS}
- Sodium channel blockers: IV lignocaine effective in CRPS; mexiletine has shown benefit in some cases
- GABA agonists: intrathecal baclofen effective for CRPS
- Others : gabapentin, CCBs, beta blockers,clonidine oral sympathlytics
- Interventional procedures: LA injections, regional blocks, surgical sympathectomy

\section*{Erythromelagia}
- A condition characterised by burning pain, warmth and redness of extremities
- Pathophysiology may be associated with thrombocythemia with arteriolar fibrosis/occlussion by platelet thrombi
- Secondary erythromelagia can occur after infections, medications, MPDs, mushroom poisoning

\section*{Erythromelagia}
- Begins with an itch which progresses to more severe burning pain
- The classical triad is redness, pain and warmth in the extremities brought by warming or dependency and relieved by cooling
- Episodes may last from minutes to days and may also involve ears, face, genitals
- During episodes the affected extremity is warm, tender, appears dusky red or mottled

\section*{Erythromelagia}
- periphera;I pulses may be bounding with acrocyanosis.
- Rarely may progress to necrosis of digits, ischemic ulcers with secondary infection
- Check for splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy as secondary erythromelagia associated with MPD may occur.

\section*{Erythromelagia}
- CBC important to detect MPD
- Imaging studies are non-specific
- Thermography reveals elevated skin temparature of affected areas
- Skin biopsy useful

\section*{Erythromelagia}
- Cool and elevate the limb
- Pharmacology ; many therapies triedaspirin, sodium channel blockers, CCBs, TCA, SSRI, gabapentin, anti histamines, immunosuppresants

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

Orthopedics is the branch of medicine that deals with disorders or deformities of the skeletal system and associated muscles, joints and ligaments.

Orthopedic Nursing is a specialty focused on prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders using the appropriate and scientific based nursing care.

ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OVERVIEW

\section*{ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OVERVIEW}

The Musculoskeletal system function is interdependent with other body systems

The bony skeleton provides a supportive framework for body structures.

Bones also stores $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (98\%), Phosphorous, magnesium and fluoride ions.

\section*{Anatomy and Physiology Overview cont'd}
- Red bone marrow produce red and white blood cells (Hematopoiesis)
- Joints hold bones together and allow movement.
- Muscles attached to bones helps moves bones and aid in heat production (maintain body temperature)

\section*{Anat... and Physio... cont'd}

\section*{Bone Cell Types:}
(i) Osteoblasts for bone formation
(ii) Osteocytes for bone maintenance
(iii) Osteoclasts for destroying, resorbing and remodeling bone substance

\section*{Other related concepts}

\section*{Ligaments}

Ligaments are parallel bands of flexible, dense fibrous connective tissue whose primary function is to connect the articular ends of bones and provide stability.

They permit movement in some directions but limit movement in other directions hence preventing joint injury, as is the case with knee and hip joints.

Ligaments also attach to soft uissue to suspend structures e.g. the Suspensory ligament of the ovaries.

\section*{Tendons}

Tendons are bands of dense fibrous tissues forming the origin and insertion of muscles.

They are aligned with sheaths, which is again lined with synovial membrane that provide lubrication for each tendon movement.

The sheaths enclose certain tendons especially in the wrist and ankle.

\section*{Fascia}

This is a sheet of loose connective tissue that may be found directly under the skin as superficial fascia or as a sheet of dense fibrous connective tissue making up a sheath of muscles, nerves and blood supply.

\section*{Bursae}

Are small sacs of connective tissue located whenever pressure is exerted over moving parts, hence preventing injury to muscle tendons.

Bursae are lined with synovial membranes and contain synovial fluid, which some ac cuchion between the moving parts.

\section*{Joints}

Are of three major types:
(i) Fibrous (Synarthroses) joints: Allows no movement at all e.g. the sutures of the Skull.
(ii) Amphiarthroses (Cartilaginous) joints: Allows little movement e.g. the intervertebral joints and the joints at the pubic symphysis.
(iii) Diathroses (Synovial): Allows free movements e.g. the mmaints.

\section*{Factors affecting bone formation}
1. Factors influencing/responsible for bone formation:

Calcium level
Phosphorus
Enzyme Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
- Calcitonin
$\square$ Vit. D
- PTH

\section*{Factors enhancing bone formation cont'd}
- Growth Hormone (GH)
- Glucocorticoids (Cortisol)
- Sex hormone (Estrogen, Androgens)

\section*{Factors limiting bone formation}
- Infection and inflammation
- Activity and Weight bearing

\section*{PHYSIOLOGY OF BONE HEALING}

The process of bone healing is known as Callus Formation. Fractures and surgical interruptions of bone both heal by the same process and occurs in five major stages as follows:
- Hematoma formation
- Fibrin meshwork formation
- Invasion of oesteoblast
- Callus formation
- Remodeling

\section*{1. Hematoma formation}

Because bone is highly vascular, bleeding occurs at both ends of the fractured bone. Increased capillary permeability permits further extravasation of blood into the injured area.

Blood or periosteal sheath or adiarent ticsuand factenc the hroken ${ }^{26}$

\section*{2. Fibrin meshwork formation}

Fibroblast invade the hematoma forming a fibrin meshwork.

White blood cells wall off the area localizing the inflammation.

\section*{3.Invasion of oesteoblast}

As oesteoblasts invade the fibrous union to make it firm, blood vessels develop from capillary buds, thereby establishing a supply for nutrients to build collagen and granulation tissue is formed.

Collagen strands become longer and begin to incorporate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ deposits leading to formation of cartilage.

\section*{4. Callus formation}

Osteoblasts form a woven bony structure known as callus.

The osteoblasts continuously lay a network for the build up of bone, while osteoclasts destroy dead bone and help in the synthesis of new ones.
$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and phosphorus are deposited as mineral salts.

\title{
5. Remodeling
}

Excess callus is reabsorbed and new bone is laid down.

This is important because bone that has not undergone remodeling lacks the mechanical properties necessary for weight bearing.

\section*{Factors impeding callus formation}
1. Inadequate/poor reduction of the fracture
2. Excessive edema at the fracture site impeding the supply of nutrients to the area of injury.
3. Excessive bone loss at the time of injury, which prevents sufficient bridging of the broken ends.

\section*{Factors Impeding Callus formation Cont'd}
4. Inefficient immobilization
5. Infection at the site of injury.
6. Bone necrosis.
7. Anemia or other systemic conditions.
8. Endocrine imbalance.

\section*{FRACTURES}

A fracture is a discontinuity or break in a bone related to a blow, fall, accident, stress or disease process.

Avulsion fractures occur when a strong ligament or tendon pulls a fragment of bone away from the rest of bone.

Broken bones affect other adjacent structures.

\section*{Effects of fractures}
- Soft tissue edema
- Hemorrhage into muscles and joints
- Joint dislocation
- Ruptured tendons
- Severed nerve
- Damaged blood vessels
- Damaged body organs

\section*{Classification/Types of fractures}

Fractures can either be:
1) Complete: There is a break across the entire bone;
2) Incomplete: Breakage occur partially;
3) Closed fracture: There is breakage but the skin remains intact; OR,
4) Open fracture: Involves the skin or mucus membrane

\section*{Complete fractures}

Complete fractures can be/includes
1) Simple(Closed)
2) Compound(Open)
3) Comminuted (Involves more than two fracture fragments)
4) Linear
5) Oblique
6) Spiral
7) Transverse

\section*{Complete fracture cont'd}
8. Impacted
9. Pathological
10. Avulsion
11. Extracapsular
12. Intracapsular

\section*{Incomplete fractures}

\section*{Incomplete fractures include}
(i) Greenstick fracture
- Torus fracture: There is buckling of the cortex caused by impaction;
- Bowing fracture: The bone becomes curved along its longitudinal axis; $O R$
- A transverse fracture occurring in the cortex and extending into the midportion of the bone but then becomes oriented along the longitudinal axis of the bone withoudisrupting the opposite cortex.

\section*{Incomplete fractures cont'd}
(ii) Stress fracture: A very small crack in bone caused by unusual or repeated stress or heavy continuous weight on the ankle or leg; typically occurs in weight-bearing bones, such as the tibia and metatarsals bones and is a common sports injury, mostly associated with athletics.
(iii) Transchondral fracture: Involves entire thickness of cartilage down to subchondral

\section*{Grading of Open fractures}

Open fractures can be graded according to level/degree of contamination as follows:
(i) Grade 1: Fracture with clean wound $\approx 1 \mathrm{~cm}$ or less.
(ii) Grade 2: Has a large wound with extensive soft tissue damage.
(iii)Grade 3: The wound is contaminated and there is extensive soft tissue damage.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES OF FRACTURES}

Common clinical manifestations of fractures include:
(i) Pain (swelling, muscle spasm)
(ii) Loss of normal function
(iii) Obvious deformity
(iv) Excessive motion at the site

Crepitus - the rattling sound or vibration produced by rabing bone or irregular cartilage surfaces together.

\section*{Clinical features of fractures cont'd}
(vi) Soft tissue edema
(vii) Warmth over injured area
(viii) Ecchymosis
(ix) Impairment or loss of sensation/paralysis

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF FRACTURES}

\section*{Objectives of Fracture Management}

\section*{The major focus during the management of fractures aims at;}
1. Reducing the fracture,
2. Immobilization, and

\title{
IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT
}
1. Maintain airway and assess for shock
2. Splint the fracture
3. Preserve correct body alignment

\title{
SECONDARY MANAGEMENT Simple Fracture:
}
1. Reduction: closed reduction/manual
manipulation
2. Traction
3. Immobilization (cast, wires, screws, plates)

\section*{Compound fracture}
1. Surgical debridement
2. Wound culture
3. Wound dressing
4. Monitor infection (osteomyelitis, tetanus, gas gangrene)
5. Wound closure
- Reduce fracture
7. Immobilize truesture

\section*{Reduction}

Is the restoration of the fracture fragments to anatomic alignment and rotation.

Reduction can be achieved in two ways:
1. Closed reduction: Aligning the bone through external manipulation/traction (cast, splint or other devices).
2. Open reduction: A surgical procedure (ORIFOpenduction with internal fixation)

\section*{Disadvantages of internal fixation}
(i) Hypersensitivity to the devices; some patients may react to the internal fixator devices.
(ii) Damage to the bone and underlying tissues during the procedure.
(iii) Infections.
(iv) Bone overgrowth may occur as the bone excludes this plate.

High chances of failure rate.
(vi) It is expensme as it may need to be removed laters

\section*{Immobilization}

Immobilization is used to hold broken bones in contact to each other until healing takes place.

This can be achieved externally through external fixators such as casts, splints, braces and traction; or internally by use of metal plates and pins.

\section*{Traction}

Is a mechanism that ensures a study pull is exerted on a part of or parts of the body to maintain adequate alignment.

Traction is used to reduce and immobilize fractures, and to maintain correct alignments.

It also helps in overcoming muscle spasms, correcting deformities and stretching adhesion.

\section*{Types of traction}
1. Skin traction

The traction device is applied directly to the skin and attaching weights to them (Buck's extension and Russel traction)

Hold $2-3.5 \mathrm{Kg}$ ( 4.5 to 8 lb )
Pelvic traction-4.5-to 9 Kg (10 to 20 lb )
Monitor skin break down as a complication of traction

\section*{Skeletal traction}

The traction device is applied directly to the bone.

Can hold 7-12 Kg (15-25 lb).
Potential complication include infection

\section*{Skeletal traction}

\section*{Principles of effective traction}
1. Use counter-traction to achieve effective traction.
2. Traction must be continuous.
3. Skeletal traction is never interrupted.
4. Do not remove weight until advised
5. Always position the patient at the centre of the bed to help avoid poor body alignment.
6. Ropes must be unobstructed
7. Weight must hang free and not rest on the floor.
8. Knots on the rope or footplate must not touch the pulley or the foot of the bed.

\section*{CAST}

Is a rigid external immobilizing device that is moulded to the contours of the body

Major purpose of the cast include:
(i) To immobilize an already reduced fracture.
(ii) To correct the deformity.
(iii) To stabilize weakened joints.

\section*{Casting Materials}

Fiberglass casts: Composed of water-activated polyurethane materials with the versatility of plaster but are more water resistant, lighter in weight and more durable than plaster

\section*{Plaster Casts:}

Consists of rolls of plaster of Paris impregnated bandages wet in cool water and smoothly applied to the body.

Produces a rigid dressing within 15-20 minutes, but require a 1-3 days to dry completely deponding on plaster thickness and environmenal drying conditions.

\section*{Types of cast}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_75d5854738dbd322f579g-067.jpg?height=1391&width=2116&top_left_y=389&top_left_x=192)

\section*{Types of casts}
1. Short arm cast: Extends from below the elbow joint to the palmar crease, secured around the base of the thumb.
2. Long arm cast: Extends from the axillar fold to the proximal palmar crease, with the elbow immobilized at right angles
3. Short leg cast: Extends from below the knee to the base of the toes with the foot flexed at right angles in a neutral position.

\section*{Types of Casts cont'd}
1. Long leg cast: Extends from the junction of the upper and middle $1 / 3^{\text {rd }}$ of the thigh to the base of the toes; the knees may be slightly flexed.
2. Walking cast: A short or long- leg cast reinforced for strength
3. Body cast: Encircles trunk
4. Shoulder/hip spica: Body jacket that encloses the trunk shoulder and elbow for shoulder spica while the hip spicrancloses the trunk and lower extremities.

\section*{Potential complications of a cast}
(i) Compartment Syndrome
(ii) Pressure ulcer
(iii) Disuse syndrome

\title{
Care of the Patient on a cast
}

Open fractures may not be treated with casts initially or if a cast is to be applied, a window may be required for dressing change
(i) The plaster must be kept dry
(ii) Assess skin under the cast for skin integrity
(iii) Spica casts should be avoided in abdominal distension

\section*{Assessment of pt on cast}

Prevent neurovascular complications by assessing the 5 P's:
(i) Pain
(ii) Parasthesia
(iii)Pulses
(iv)Palor (colour)
(v) Paralysis

Together with edema, temperature and capillary refill.

\title{
Pathophysiology
}

Trauma------ fluid accumulates in compartment ----------- increased pressures -------decrease blood supply------------ tissue hypoxia ------- increased permeability -------compartment pressure continue to rise.

\section*{Management of C. Syndrome}

Goals of management include:
1. To decrease tissue pressure.
2. To restore blood flow.
3. To preserve function of the affected limb.

(v) Restricted ability/inability to move.
(vi) Roport of a "popping" sensation $\mathrm{by}_{91}$ the patient

\section*{SOFT TISSUE INJURIES}

\title{
Soft Tissue Injuries Contusions \\ Strains \\ Sprains
}

\section*{Contusions}

A Contusion is a soft tissue injury produced by a blunt force such as a blow, a kick or even a fall.

The small blood vessels rupture and bleed into soft tissues leading to ecchymosis or a bruise.

Hematoma may develop if bleeding is pronounced.

\section*{Symptoms of Contusion include}
(i) Pain
(ii) Swelling
(iii) Joint dislocation

Management strategies include
- Intermittent application of cold compresses
- Resting the affected limb

Most contusion resolve within 1-2 weeks

\section*{Strains}

A strain is a muscle pull caused by overuse, overstretching or excessive stress on a muscle.

It is a microscopic, incomplete muscle tear, with some bleeding into the tissue.

Signs may include
(i) Isometric muscle contraction
(ii) Sudden pain with local tenderness on muscle.

\section*{Sprains}

A sprain refers to an injury to the ligaments surrounding a joint, commonly caused by a wrench or twisting.
A torn ligament loses its stabilizing ability
Common symptoms of sprain include:
- Oedema
- Tenderness which increase within 2-3 hours
- Decreased movement

An X-ray film should be taken to rule out an awlsion fracture

\section*{Management of Soft tissue Injuries}

The management of contusions, strains and sprains, can be summed up with the acronym "RICE"
$\boldsymbol{R}=\boldsymbol{R} \boldsymbol{e} \boldsymbol{s} \boldsymbol{t}$
Resting the affected limb prevent additional injury and promote healing.
$\boldsymbol{I}=\boldsymbol{I} \boldsymbol{c} \boldsymbol{e}$
Application of cold compresses produces vasoconstriction hence decreasing the edema and discomfort associated with such injuries.

C = Compression
An elastic bandage provides pressure that controls bleeding, reduces edema and also supports the underlying structures.

\section*{E = Elevation}

Elevating a limb controls swelling by increasing venous return to the central circulation.

Surgical repair is done for tone torn muscle and disrupted ligament.

\title{
JOINT DISLOCATION
}

\section*{Joint Dislocation cont'd}

Is a condition in which the articular surfaces of the bones forming a joint are no longer in anatomical approximation to each other causing pain and impaired movement at such joints.

The impairment of the approximation of bone surfaces can be total or incomplete/partial, in which case the condition is referred to as a subluxation.

\section*{Joint dislocation cont'd}

Dislocations can also be classified as:
- Congenital: present at birth
- Spontaneous or
- Traumatic

A traumatic joint dislocation constitutes an orthopedic emergency which can lead to avascular necrosis and nerve palsy if not promptly treated, because the associated joint structures are distorted and severely stretched.

\section*{Joint dislocation commonly manifests with:}
(i) Pain on the affected joint and around it.
(ii) Change in joint contour
(iii) Change in length of the extremity involvd
(iv) Loss of normal mobility
(v) Change in the axis of the dislocated bones

An X-ray film can be taken to help confirms the diagnosis

\section*{Management OI Dislocation}
1. Immobilize the affected joint/s
2. Promptly reduce the joint
3. Control pain
4. Monitor neurovascular status
5. Perform range of motion(ROM)
6. Educar on how to immobilize joint

Predisposing factor to Osteomyelitis
(i) Malnutrition
(ii) Elderly /Old age
(iii) Obesity
(iv) Impaired immune systems

Post operative surgical wound which occur surgery

\section*{Causative organisms of Osteomyeliti}

Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for approximately 70 $80 \%$ of all bone infections.

Other causative organisms of bone infections include:
- Proteus spp.
- Pseudomonas spp.
- Escherichia coli

\section*{Osteomyelitis cont'd}

Bone infections are more difficult to eradicate than soft tissue infections.

This is because the affected bones become walled off; natural body immune responses are blocked and there is less penetration by antibiotics

Osteomyelitis may become chronic and affect quality of life.

\section*{Pathophysiology of Osteomyelitis} The initial response to infection is inflammation, increased vascularity, and edema. After 2 or 3 days, thrombosis of the blood vessels occurs in the area, resulting in ischemia with bone necrosis.

The infection extends into the medullary cavity and under the periostum and may spread into

\section*{Pathophysiology cont'd}

Unless the infective process is treated promptly, a bone abscess forms.

This abscess cavity contains dead bone tissue called a sequestrum, which does not easily liquefy and drain.

Therefore, the cavity cannot collapse and heal, as occurs in soft tissue abscesses. New bone growth, called involucrum, forms and surrounds the sequestrum.

\section*{Pathophysiology cont'd}

Although healing appears to take place, a chronically infected sequestrum remains and produces recurring abscesses throughout the patient's life causing a chronic osteomyelitis.

\section*{RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS}

\section*{Rheumatoid Arthritis}

Arthritis is an inflammation of the joint, causing pain and stiffness.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, systemic disease characterized by recurrent inflammation of the diarthrodial joints, related structures and the surrounding tissues.

\section*{Aetiology}

The exact cause of RA is not clearly understood
Theories suggesting:
(i) Infection e.g with Epstern-Barr virus, the parvoviruses and mycobacteria may trigger the process.
(ii) Auto-immunity
(iii) Genetic factors
(iv) Others: such as metabolic and biochemical abnormalities, nutritional, environmental and occupational factors.

\section*{Pathophysiology of R. Arthritis}

The disease progresses through four stages:
1. The unknown aetiologic factor initiate synovitis with swelling of the synovial membrane producing excess synovial fluid.
2. Inflammatory granular tissue called pannus is formed at the junction of the synovial membrane and cartilage.

This eventually spreads and invades the joint capsule and subchondrial bone.

\section*{Pathophysiology cont'd}
3. A tough fibrous connective tissue replaces the pannus thus occluding the joint space. This results into fibrous ankylosis causing a decrease in joint motion and increased deformity.
4. As the fibrous tissue calcifies, bony ankylosis may result in total joint immobilization.

\section*{Systemic manifestations of R. Arthritis}
-Pulmonary
- Cardiac
- Vascular
- Ophthalmological
- Dermatological
- Hematological

\section*{Clinical features of R. Arthritis}

The signs and symptoms of RA are quite non specific and insidious. These may include
1. Fatigue
2. Anorexia
3. Weight loss, fever, malaise, morning stiffness of the joints.
4. Pain during rest and movement; night pains, edematous, erythematous "boggy joints"
5. History of precipitating stressful event

\section*{Clinical features of RA cont'd}
6. Limitation of motion.
7. Signs of inflammation.
8. Bilateral joint symptoms (small joints).
9. Cervical joints may be affected.

\section*{Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis}

The goal of therapy is to:
1. Relieve symptoms
2. Prevent joint destruction
3. Maintain joint functions

\section*{Management of RA cont'd}
- Administer drug to control pain (NSAIDS, Corticosteroids)
- Stabilize /Support the joints
- Protect a joint or body part from external trauma.
- Assist the patient to exercise specific joints
- Apply cold pacts
- Rest, excise and diet are important

\section*{Management of RA cont'd}
- Surgery may be indicated to correct the deformity, relieve pain and restore function.
- Educate the patient on balance of rest and activity, joint protection and energy conservation, proper use of medication and safety measures to prevent injury

\section*{SEPTIC ARTHRITIS}

\section*{Septic Arthritis}

In S. Arthritis, the joint become is either infected through infections from another part of the body or directly through trauma or surgical instrumentation.

Factors that may predispose to S. Arthritis include:
(i) Trauma to the joints.
(ii) Joint replacement
(iii) Coexisting arthritis
(iv) Diminished host resistance

\section*{Causative organisms of septic arthritis}

The leading causative agent is Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Streptococci and some gram negative organisms have also

Prompt recognition and treatment of infected joints are important because accumulating pus results in chondrolysis (destruction of hyaline cartilage)

\section*{Clinical Manifestations of S. Arthritis}

The patient with acute septic arthritis usually presents with:
(i) A warm, painful, swollen joint with decreased range of motion.
(ii) Chills and fever
(iii) Leukocytosis.

\section*{Diagnostic measures for $S$. Arthritis}
(i) Signs and symptoms
(ii) Culture of synovial fluid
(iii) Computed tomography

5.
(i) Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics are started promptly and then changed to organismspecific antibiotics after culture results are available.
(ii) Needle aspiration (Arthrocentesis) to remove excess fluid exudate, and debris.
(iii) Immobilize the joint in a functional position

\section*{S. Arthritis Management cont'd}
(iv) Administer analgesia and anti-inflammatory agents such as NSAIDS.
(v) Ensure proper/adequate nutrition and
hydration.
(vi) Educate the patient on medication, the septic arthritis process, importance of supporting the affected joint and strategies to promote healing through aseptic dressing changes and proper wound are.

\section*{Osteoarthritis}

Also known as Degenerative Joint Disease (DJD), this is a slowly progressive disorder of articulating joints, especially in the weight bearing joints.

It is characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage and overgrowth of bone.

Damage is localized to the joints and surrounding tissues

\section*{Aetiology of OA}

May occur as Primary (Idiopathic)
Osteoarthritis or Secondary, resulting from a previous joint injury or inflammatory disease.

Risk factors to Secondary OA may include:
(i) Previous fractures.
(ii) Infections
(iii) Congenital deformities
(iv) Old age - usually seen in 50-70 years but may also occur as early as 45 years

\section*{Aetiology of OA cont'd}

Other factors influencing development of osteoarthritis include:
- Osteochondritis of head of femur esp. in children (congenital structural defects).
- Metabolic disturbances such as obesity and overweight.
- Repeated intra-articular hemorrhage
- Septic arthritis

Excessive stress on joints through occupational or recreationameated use.

\section*{Pathophysiology of OA}

The factors responsible for OA development (genetic and hormonal factors, mechanical injury, previous joint damage or any other factor) stimulates a Chondrocytic response in the affected joint.

\section*{The stimulated chondrocytes releases chemokines and cytokines.}

This leads to the Stimulation, production, and release of proteolytic enzymes, metalloproverses collagenases.

\section*{Pathophysiology of OA cont'd}

The resulting damage caused by the proteolytic enzymes and metalloproteases, further predisposes to more chondrocyte response leading to further damage.

With degeneration over time, bones become yellow and opaque with rough surfaces and areas of malacia (softening).

New bone outgrowth are formed at the joint margins and at the attachment sites of ligament.

\section*{Clinical manifestation of OA}
(i) Joint enlargement and Crepitus
(ii) Pain which increases with weight bearing
(iii) Limited joint motion
(iv) Morning stiffness (less than one hour)
(v) Non-inflammatory effusion

\section*{Management of OA}

There is no specific management but therapy is aimed at symptomatic relief and control of pain.

Encourage appropriate nutritional intake to maintain ideal weight.

Behavioural change especially with occupation and exercises.

Surgical Intervention may be indicated.

\section*{GOUT}

Gout is a heterogeneous group of conditions related to a defect of purine metabolism resulting in hyperuricemia (a uric acid serum concentration ${ }^{>} 7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ [ $0.4 \mathrm{fmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ]).

Oversecretion of uric acid or a renal defect resulting in decreased excretion of uric acid, or a combination of both, occurs.

The incidence increases with age and body mass index and it tends to occur more commone in males than females.

\section*{Gout cont'd}

Is the principal manifestation of sustained hyperuricaemia.

Men are ten times more likely to have gout than women (At puberty male uric level rise and remain higher than those of females until menopause when female uric level rise)

Serum uric acid are related to Age, sex and genetic constitution.

\section*{Gout Classification}

\section*{Gout can be classified as Primary or Secondary.}

In Primary hyperuricemia, elevated serum urate levels or manifestations of urate deposition are due to faulty uric acid metabolism.

Primary hyperuricemia may be due to severe dieting or starvation, excessive intake of foods that are high in purines (shellfish, organ meats), or nexedity.

\section*{Classification of Gout cont'd}

In Secondary hyperuricemia, gout is a clinical feature secondary to any of a number of genetic or acquired processes.

Such processes may include conditions in which there is an increase in cell turnover such as leukemia, multiple myeloma, some types of anemias, psoriasis and even an increase in cell breakdown.

\section*{Gout cont'd}

About $60 \%$ of uric acid is replaced daily and approximately $75 \%$ of uric acid is excreted in the kidney and remainder lost in the gut.

Uric acid is filtered at glomerulus and $90 \%$ is then reabsorbed

\section*{Causes of hyperuricemia}
- Prolonged use of diuretic drugs are the main cause but clinical gout is unknown
- Renal failure
- Increased production of uric acid: polycthaemia, hemolytic anemia, severe psoriasis and carcinomatosis.
- Decreased renal excretion of uric acid-chronic renal disease, drug administration, reduction in fractional urate clearance

\section*{Causes of hyperuriceamia cont'd}

The patient with Gout is usually obese, and drinks more alcohol. Dietary purines have a modest effect on plasma uric level

Short term alteration in diet such as starvation and ingestion of large amount of alcohol may cause hyperuricaemia by reducing renal clearance of uric acid due to increased lactic acid production which competes with uric acid excretion in the kidneys

\title{
Pathophysiology of Gout
}

Prolonged hyperuricemia leads to crystal formation, which may accumulate in synovium and at external sites.

When crystal are phagocytosed there is interaction between the crystals and lysosomal membrane due to weak acid groups and membrane disruption follows.

Phagocytosis of urate leads to increased production of lactic acid which causes further precipitation of crystals.

\section*{Clinical features of Gout}
- Patient is obese
- Pain usually early morning affecting the big toe.
- Affected joints are usually red, swollen and warm

\section*{Precipitating factors of Gout}
- Joint trauma
- Unusually physical exercise
- Alcohol
- High protein diet/starvation
- Surgery
- Drugs
- Severe incidental illness

\section*{Diagnosis of Gout}
- History
- X-ray
- Serum uric level measurements

\section*{Management of Gout}

The goal of treatment is to:
(i) Reduce acute synovitis
(ii) Prevent further crystallization
(iii) Identify associated disease

Acute synovitis can be managed by NSAIDs and even Colchicine.

\section*{Management of Gout cont'd}

Prevention of crystallization through:
- Weight reduction, especially among obese and overweight individuals
- Reduction of alcohol consumption
- Evaluate need for diuretic drugs

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS}

Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by a reduction in bone density and change in bone structure.

In this case the rate of bone resorption is greater than that of bone formation resulting in reduced total bone mass, hence increasing susceptibility to fractures.

Bones are porous, brittle and fragile i.e. fractures easily under stress that would not break a normal bone.

Commonly results in compressed fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine ${ }_{164}$ and intertrocnameric regions of femur.

\section*{Predisposing Osteoporosis}

\section*{factors}

Normal bone remodeling increases bone mass until early 30s.

Gender, race, genetics, aging, low body weight and body mass index, nutrition, lifestyle and physical activity influence peak bone mass and development of osteoporosis.

Osteoporosis is not a disease of the elderly but fractures occur with aging, onset occur in eas life when bone mass peak begins to decline

\section*{Pathophysiology of Osteoporosis}

After peak bone mass is achieved, Calcitonin ,which inhibits bone resorption and promotes bone formation is decreased.

Estrogen which inhibits bone breakdown decreases with aging

Parathyroid hormone increases with aging increasing bone turnover and resorption resulting to loss of bone mass

Women develop osteoporosis more than men because of lower bone peak mass and the effectof estrogen loss during menopause

\section*{Factors affecting bone mass}
- Genetics
- Nutrition
- Age
- Physical exercise
- Lifestyle choices
- Medication

\section*{Risk Factors}
- Small framed non-obese individuals
- Race
- Sex
- Nutritional factors
- Lifestyle

\title{
Diagnosis
}
- X-Ray

Laboratory studies (calcium, serum
phosphate)

\section*{Management of Osteoporosis}
(i) Adequate nutrition rich in calcium and vitamin D throughout life, with an increased calcium intake during adolescence, young adulthood, and the middle years, protects against skeletal demineralization.
(ii) Calcium supplementation e.g., Caltrate ${ }^{\circledR}$, Citrocal® may be prescribed and taken with meals or with a beverage high in Vit. $\boldsymbol{C}$ to promote absorption.
(iii) Regular weight bearing exercises to promotes bone formation.

\section*{Management of Osteoporosis cont'd}
(iv)Hormonal Replacement Therapy (HRT) with estrogen and progesterone, especially at natural or surgical menopause.
(v)Calcitonin to suppress bone loss.
(vi)If the patient has a fracture, manage appropriately depending on the condition.

\section*{Prevention of Osteoporosis}
(i) Early identification of at risk teenagers and young adults
(ii) Regular weight bearing exercise.
(iii) Modification of lifestyle (caffeine, cigarettes and alcohol)
(iv) Observe for precipitating factors.

\section*{Osteomalacia}

\section*{Is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by inadequate mineralization of bone.}

Faulty mineralization leads to softening and weakening of the skeleton.

\section*{Pathophysiology Osteomalacia}

\section*{of}

Deficiency of Vitamin D (calcitriol) which promotes calcium absorption from GI leads to low calcium and phosphate movement to calcification.

Osteo-malacia may result from failed calcium absorption (malabsorption syndrome) or from excessive loss of calcium from the body.

GI disorders -fats are inadequately absorbed are likely to produce osteo-malacia through loss of calcium and Vit D, the first being excreted in feces.

\section*{Pathophysiology cont'd}

Liver and kidney diseases can produce lack of Vit D because these are organs that convert Vit D to its active form.

The malnutrition type of Osteomalacia is as a result of poverty

\section*{Clinical manifestations Osteomalacia}

\section*{of}
- Softening and weakening of the skeleton.
- Pain and tenderness to touch.
- Bowing of the bones
- Pathologic fracture
- On exam-skeletal deformity (spinal kyphosis and bowed leg)
- Limping gait

\section*{Diagnosis}

Osteomalacia
(i) History of the presenting disorder.
(ii) X-ray film reveals a generalized demineralization of bone.
(iii) Serology reveals a low serum calcium and phosphorous level with a moderately elevated concentration of alkaline phosphatase.
(iv) Urinalysis excretion of calcium and creatinine is low.
(v) Bone biopsy reveals an increase in osteoid levels.

\section*{Management of Osteomalacia}
(i) Correct the underlying cause/disorder.
(ii) Increase dose of Vit D with supplement calcium, if the disorder is due to malabsorption. (High doses of Vit. D are toxic hence adequate monitoring is very necessary).
(iii) Sunlight exposure to promote Vit. D utilization.

\section*{Management of Osteomalacia cont'd}
(i) Provide adequate diet/nutrition.
(ii) Use physical, psychological and
pharmaceutical measures.
(iii) Long term monitoring of patient progress is required.

BONE TUMOURS

\section*{Bone tumors}

Neoplasm of the musculoskeletal system are of various types.

\section*{They may be primary tumors or metastatic from primary cancers .}

Metastatic bone tumours are more common than primary bone tumours.

\section*{Benign Bone tumours}

Benign bone tumours are more common than malignant primary bone tumours.

They are slow growing, well circumscribed, present few symptoms and are not a cause of death.

\section*{Types of Benign Bone}

\section*{tumours}
(i) Osteochondroma: Is the most common, develops during growth and becomes static. It may become malignant in rare cases, especially, after trauma.
(ii) Enchondroma: A tumour of hyaline cartilage commonly affecting the hand, femur, tibia and humerus.

Presents with mild ache and pathologic freture may occur.

\section*{Benign Tumours cont.}
(iii) Bone cysts
- Osteoid osteoma: A painful tumour that occur in children and young adults.
- Giant Cell Osteoclastoma: Remain benign for a long period but may undergo malignancy transformation, invade and local tissues.
Are soft, hemorrhagic and common in young adults.

\section*{Malignant Bone tumours}

Are quite rare and usually arise from connective and supportive tissue cells (sarcomas) or bone marrow elements such as multiple myeloma.

An example is Osteosarcoma: (Osteogenic sarcoma) the most common and often a fatal primary malignant bone tumour.

Prognosis depend on whether it has spread to other organs such as the lungs, liver etc (Bone tumor metastasis to the lungs is common).

Appears mostly in males (10-25 yrs), older people with Paet's disease, and may also occur followigg radiation expe

\section*{Clinical manifestations of Bone tumors}

Commonly affects the distal femur, proximal tibia and proximal humerus, presenting with:
(i) Pain
(ii) Swelling
(iii) Limited motion
(iv) Weight loss
(v) Paipule bony mass

\title{
Malignant tumour types
}
(i) Chondrosarcoma - Common among adults.
(ii) Ewing's sarcoma.
(iii) Fibrosarcoma.
(iv) Liposarcoma

\section*{Nursing care of a patient with bone tumour}
(i) Pain management.
(ii) Evaluation of activities of daily living (ADL).
(iii) Prevention of pathological fracture.
(iv) Promote coping skill.
(v) Promote self esteem.
(vi) Promote understanding of disease process

\section*{AMPUTATION}

\section*{Amputation}

Amputation is one of the oldest surgical procedures with artificial limbs identified from over 2000 years ago.

It refers to the removal of the whole or part of an arm/hand or a leg/foot.

Amputations can occur after an injury (traumatic amputation) or deliberately at surgery.

In vascular surgery amputations are only rarely performed on the arms. Vascular surgeons frequently have to perform amputations of toes or legs.

\section*{Causes of Amputation}
(i) Peripheral vascular disease.
(ii) Gas gangrene.
(iii) Trauma.
(iv) Congenital deformities.
(v) Malignant osteomyelitis/tumour.

\section*{Amputations cont'd}

A majority of amputations are performed because the arteries of the limbs have been blocked following insufficient blood supply to the limb.

About $30-40 \%$ of amputations are performed in patients with diabetes, because diabetes can cause hardening of the arteries. Patients with DM can develop foot/toe ulceration and about 7\% of patients will have an active ulcer or a healed ulcer.

Ulcers are recurrent in many patients and approximately $5-15 \%$ of diabetic patients with ulcerswill ultimately require an amputation.

\section*{Types of amputations}

Amputations can be divided into minor and major.

Minor amputations are amputations where only a toe or part of the foot is removed. A ray amputation is a particular form of minor amputation where a toe and part of the corresponding metatarsal bone is removed.

A forefoot amputation can sometimes be helpful in patients with more than one toe invelved by gangrene.

\section*{Below knee amputation}

This operation can be performed using 2 major techniques. The most common technique is the Posterior Myoplastic flap (Burgess) technique where the skin and muscle from the calf are brought forward to cover the shin bones after they have been divided.

The other main technique is the Skew flap (Kingsley Robinson) technique in which the muscles of the calf are brought forward in the same way as in the posterior technique but the skin flaps are skewed in relation to the muscle.

Below knee amputation incision

\section*{Above knee amputation}

In this procedure the bone in the thigh (femur) is divided about 12-15 cm above the knee joint and the muscle and skin closed over the end of the bone.

\section*{Amputation related Complications}
(i) Hemorrhage
(ii) Infections
(iii) Skin breakdown
(iv) Phantom limb pain
(v) Joint contractures

\section*{Assignment}

\section*{Read and make notes on the following}
(i) Care of the stump.
(ii) Nursing care of patient undergoing amputation.

\section*{LOW BACK PAIN}

\section*{Low Back Pains}

Low back pains constitutes one of the most common reasons for seeking medical attention.

Approximately ${ }^{>} 84 \%$ of adults will have low back pain at some point. Some suffer from chronic or recurrent courses, with substantial impact on quality of life

Most episodes of low back pains are self-limiting

Treatment comprises a wide variety of approaches and no specific approach would be suggested as the most optimuns.

\section*{Low Back Pains cont'd}

Any structure in the back can cause pain, including ligaments, joints, periosteum, musculature, blood vessels, annulus fibrosus and nerves. Intervertebral discs and facet joints being the most commonly affected.
$85 \%$ of those with isolated low back pains do not have a clear localization. There is no clear histopathology or anatomical location, and is commonly referred to as "strain" or "sprain".

Age of onset is usually above 35 yrs old with men and womang affected equally almost at the same rate.

\section*{Low Back Pains cont'd}

Low back pains is the leading and expensive cause of work disability in those < 45 years

Risk factors Include:
(i) Heavy lifting
(ii) Twisting and vibration exercises
(iii) Obesity.
(iv) Poor conditioning.

\section*{Diagnosis of Low Back Pain}
1. History

Any evidence of systemic disease?
${ }^{\circ}$ Age (especially >50),
- History of cancer, unexplained weight loss, chronic infection.
- Duration of illness
${ }^{\circ}$ Presence of nocturnal pain
- Response to therapy
- Many patients with infection or malignancy will not have relief when lying down
For arthritis patients - young age, nocturnal pain and worsening with rest are common

\section*{Diagnosis of Low Back Pain cont'd}

Any evidence of neurologic compromise e.g.
(i) Cauda equina syndrome: a medical emergency usually due to a tumor or massive herniation compressing nerves at the cauda equina. Urinary retention with overflow, saddle anesthesia, bilateral sciatica, leg weakness, fecal incontinence.
(ii) Sciatica: a nerve root irritation characterised by sharp/burning pain down the posterior or lateral leg to foot or ankle; can be associated with numbness/tingling. If due to disc herniation often worsens with cough, sneeze or performing the Valsalva.

\section*{Diagnosis of Low Back Pain cont'd}

Any evidence of neurologic compromise e.g:
(iii) Spinal stenosis: Caused by narrowing of the spinal canal, nerve root canals, or intervertebral foramina.

Most commonly due to bony hypertrophic changes in facet joints and thickening of the ligamentum flavum.

Disc bulging or spondylolisthesis may also cause back pain. Transient leg tingling, pain in calf and lower extremity that is triggered by ambulation and improved with rest, are common symptoms..

Can be differentiated from vascular claudication through detection of normal arterial pulses on exam.

\section*{Diagnosis of Low Back Pain cont'd}

\section*{2. Physical Examination}

Inspection of back and posture (ie. Scoliosis, kyphosis)
- Range of motion
- Palpation of the spine (vertebral tenderness sensitive for infection)
- If high suspicion of malignancy, do a breast/prostate/lymph node exam
- Peripheral pulses to distinguish from vascular claudication

\section*{Physical Examination}

Straight leg raise: for those with sciatica or spinal stenosis symptoms
- Patient supine, examiner holds patient's leg straight
- Elevation of less than 60 degrees abnormal and suggests compression or irritation of nerve roots
- Reproduces sciatica symptoms (NOT just hamstring)
- Ipsilateral straight leg raise sensitive but not specific for herniated disk
- Crossed straight leg raise (symptoms of sciatica reproduced when opposite leg is raised) insensitive but highly specific

\section*{Physical examination}
- Neurologic examination
- L5: ankle and great toe dorsiflexion
-S1: plantar flexion, ankle reflex
- Dermatomal sensory loss
- L5: numbness medial foot and web space between $1^{\text {st }}$ and $2^{\text {nd }}$ toes
-S1: lateral foot/ankle

\section*{Imaging}
- AP and lateral L-spine if no clinical improvement after 4-6 weeks
"Clinicians should not routinely obtain imaging or other diagnostic tests in patients with nonspecific low back pain" (American College of Physicians and American Pain Society).
- Do perform x-rays if: fever, unexplained weight loss, hx of cancer, neurologic deficits, EtOH, age $<18$ or >50, trauma, immunosuppression, probaged steroid use, skin/urinary infection, indwelling theter

\section*{Imaging}
- CT and MRI
- More sensitive for detection of infection and cancer than plain films
- Also able to image herniated discs and spinal stenosis, which cannot be appreciated on plain films
- Beware: herniated/bulging discs often found in asymptomatic volunteers $\square$ may lead to overdiagnosis/overtreatment
- MRI better than CT for detection of infection, metastases, rare neural tumours
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_75d5854738dbd322f579g-212.jpg?height=1835&width=2259&top_left_y=20&top_left_x=127)

\section*{Natural History}
- Most recover rapidly
- $90 \%$ of patients seen within 3 days of symptom onset recovered within 2 weeks
- Recurrences are common
- Most have chronic disease with intermittent exacerbations
- Spinal stenosis is the exception $\square$ usually gets progressively worse with time

\section*{Management of Low Back Pain}
- Non-specific low back pain
- Regular NSAIDs and muscle relaxants good for symptomatic relief.
- Spinal manipulation of limited utility in studies
- Should recommend rapid return to normal activities with neither bed rest nor exercise in the acute period
- Bed rest found to not improve and may delay recovery
- Exercises not useful in acute phase; use in chronic

\section*{Therapy}
- Nonspecific low back pain
- Traction, facet joint injections have minimal effects.
- Systematic reviews of acupunture have shown little benefit
- ? Massage therapy have some promising results
- Surgery only effective for sciatica, spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis

\section*{Therapy}
- Herniated intervertebral discs
- Nonsurgical treatment for at least a month
- Exceptions: cauda equina syndrome, progressive neurologic deficits
- Early treatment same as for nonspecific low back pain, but may need short courses of narcotics for pain control
- Bed rest not useful
-Some patients benefit from epidural corticosteroid injections
- If severe pain, neurologic defecits consider MRI and surgery.

\section*{Therapy}
- Spinal stenosis
- Physiotherapy to reduce risk of falls
- Analgesics, NSAIDs, epidural corticosteroids
- Decompressive laminecotomy
- Spinal fusion with decompression if there is additional spondylolisthesis
- Symptoms often recur, even after successful surgery

\section*{Therapy}
- Chronic low back pain
- Intensive exercise improves function and reduces pain, but is difficult to adhere to
- Anti-depressants: many with chronic low back pain are also depressed
- ? Maybe for those without depression (tricyclics)
- Opiates
- Small RCT showed better effect on pain and mood than NSAIDs
- No improvement in activity
- Significant side effects: drowsiness, constipation, nausea

\section*{Therapy}
- Chronic low back pain
- Referral to multidisciplinary pain center
$\square$ Cognitive-behavioural therapy, education, exercise, selective nerve blocks
${ }^{\circ}$ Surgical procedures rarely helpful

\section*{Sacroiliitis}
- Usually bilateral and symmetric
- Initially involves the synovial-lined lower 2/3 of the Sacro-iliac joint.
- Early changes involves erosion on the iliac side of SI joint , the cartilage becomes thinner, and can cause "pseudowidening" of SI joint.

\section*{Spinal Involvement}
- Gradual ossification of the outer layers of the annulus fibrosis (Sharpey's fibers) form interverterbral bony bridges called syndesmophytes.
- Fusion of the apophyseal joints and calcification of the spinal ligaments along with bilateral syndesmophyte formation can result in "bamboo spine"

\section*{Enthesitis}
- Enthesis: site of insertion of ligament, tendon or articular capsule into bone.
- Enthesitis: Is the inflammation of enthesis resulting in new bone formation or fibrosis.
- Common sites: SI joints, intervertebral discs, manubriosternal joints, symphysis pubis, iliac crests, trochanters, patellae, clavicles, calcanei (Achille's or plantar fasciitis)

\section*{Treatment of Enthesitis}

\section*{1. NSAIDs}
- Good for mild symptoms
- Potentially disease modifying
- Indomethacin seems to work the best
- Beware of side effects, especially gastrointestinal disease

2. Disease - Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs).
- Sulfasalazine $1000-2000 \mathrm{mg}$ bid

Seems to be the most effective for spinal symptoms.
- Methotrexate $15-25 \mathrm{mg}$ weekly
- For patients with prominent peripheral arthritis
- Doesn't work very well for spinal symptoms

\section*{Treatment}

\section*{3. Steroids}
- Not very effective at all in AS
- Local injections for enthesitis or peripheral arthritis
4. Anti-TNFa agents
- Remicade (infliximab), Enbrel (etanercept) and Humira (adalimumab)
- Very useful for treating symptoms, improving ROM, improving fatigue
-Hopefully disease-modifying . . .

Club foot in baby

\section*{TALIPES/ CLUB FOOT}

Is a congenitally inverted foot in which adduction, plantar flexion \& inversion of the foot occur in varying degrees of severity.
The unilateral form occur commonly than the bilateral form.

\section*{RISK FACTORS}
1. Intrauterine compression -faulty posture of the fetus in the uterus
2. Decreased growth of distal tibia
3. Family history of talipes
4. Poor muscular development-poor muscles allow the bone to dislocate.

\section*{TALIPES}

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}

Clinical manifestation

\section*{TREATMENT/MEDICAL MANAGEMENT}

Treatment is began immediately \& most often requires three stages for correction.
(a) Correction of deformity: Casts are applied in series for gradual stretching \& strengthening;
Massages accompanied by special bandaging may be used.

\section*{TALIPES/ CLUB FOOT}
(b) Maintainance of correction: Orthopaedic shoes.
(c) Follow-up observations to prevent recurrence of the deformity.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTION}
1. To assist parents to understand mechanism of treatment to achieve correction.
(a) Appropriate care of cast or brace at home

\section*{TALIPES}
(b) Follow-up care \& importance of frequent cast changes.
2. To facilitate developmental progress \& adapt nurturing activities.
(a) Provide appropriate stimuli \& activity for developmental level.
(b) Encourage parents to hold \& cuddle the baby.
(c) Maintain normal home routine.

\section*{TALIPES}

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA}
- Also called brittle bone disease.
- Is a defect in the production of collagen resulting in repeated fractures with minor trauma.
> Spontaneous fractures occur in utero (osteogenesis congenita) or during birth or childhood (osteogenesis imperfecta tarda)
> Healing of the bone fractures progresses normally.

\section*{OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA}
- Later in life the tendency to fracture decrease \& often disappears.
- Vast majority of cases are transmitted as autosomal dorminant traits although a small percentage of congenital cases are transmitted as autosomal recessive

\section*{OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA}

\section*{PRESENTATION}
1. Trauma during delivery may lead to intracranial hemorrhage \& stillbirth.
2. At birth the skull is soft \& feels like a "bag of bones".
3. Infants born alive may die suddenly during the first few days or week.
4. Survivors develop shortened extremities \& other bony deformities.

\section*{OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA}
5. Mental development is normal unless CNS injury occurs.
6. The sclerae is thin, translucent \& appear blue.
7. Hearing loss from otosclerosis may occur.
8. Joint instability.

\section*{OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA}

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
- To prevent fractures \& increase function
$\square$ Orthopedic treatment
$\square$ Physiotherapy \& occupational therapy
- Treatment with biphosphonate pamidronate given iv has been shown to increase bone mineral density \& motor function \& may decrease bone pain \& resorption.

\title{
OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA
}

\section*{COMPLICATION}
1. Failure to gain weight
2. Bone deformities \& dwarfism

\section*{HIP DYSPLASIA}
- Is a malformation of the hip as a result of imperfect development of the femoral head or the acetabulum or both.
- The structures that support the hip joint \& holds the joint together are too loose, or the joint cavity is too shallow.

\section*{RISK FACTORS}
1. Frequently associated with other congenital deformities.
2. Prenatal factors e.g. maternal hormonal secretion, intrauterine posture especially frank breech position

\section*{HIP DYSPLASIA}

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS (NEWBORN)}
1. Ortolani's sign: Infant supine, knees flexed, hips fully abducted, a click is heard or felt as the hip is reduced by the abduction.
2. Asymmetrical gluteal \& thigh folds.
3. Shortening of the leg on the affected side, one knee is lower than the other (Galeazzi sign)

\section*{HIP DYSPLASIA}

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
- X-ray film
- CT Scan

\section*{TREATMENT}
- Is initiated as soon as condition is identified
* For newborn, the dislocated hip is securely held in a full abduction position. This keeps the femur in the acetabulum \& stabilizes the area

\section*{HIP DYSPLASIA}
- Abduction devices
a) Pavlik harness: a fabric, strap harness that is secured around the infant's shoulders \& chest \& is connected to straps around the lower leg. The harness maintains the legs in a flexed, abducted position at the hip. The harness maybe removed for bathing, but the infant will wear it full time until the hip is stable.

\section*{HIP DYSPLASIA}
b) Hip spica cast, most often used when adduction contracture is present. After the removal of the cast, a protective abduction brace is fitted.
c) Closed reduction: Performed in older children, 6-8 months old.
d) Open reduction: becomes increasingly difficult after the age of 4 years.

\section*{HIP DYSPLASIA}

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTION}
1. To identify hip dysplasia in the newborn before discharge.
2. To assist parents to understand mechanisms to maintain reduction
(a) Pavlik brace: Teach parents the application of brace, undershirts should be worn beneath the brace. Check skin under brace for irritation or pressure areas, no lotions or oils should be applied to the skin that will be under brace.

\section*{HIP DYSPLASIA}
(b) Teach parents cast care if hip spica cast is applied.
3. To facilitate developmental progress.
a) Provide appropriate stimuli \& activity for developmental level.
b) Encourage parents to hold \& cuddle child.
c) Maintain normal home routine.

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS (POROUS BONE)}

Osteoporosis
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_683a8d02447446e789a3g-025.jpg?height=1127&width=1592&top_left_y=546&top_left_x=432)

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS (POROUS BONE)}
- A metabolic bone disease that involves an imbalance between new bone formation \& bone resorption.
- Primary osteoporosis is the most common type, often in women after menopause because low levels of estrogen are associated with an increase in bone resorption.
- Bone loss occurs predominantly in the vertebral bodies of the spine, femoral neck in the hip, \& the distal radius of the arm. Bone mass declines, leaving the bones brittle \& weak.

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS (POROUS BONE)}

\section*{RISK FACTORS}
1. Increased incidence in women after the age of 50 yrs.
2. Early menopouse
3. Low peak bone mass (maximum amount of bone a person achieves)
4. Excessive alcohol intake-act on bone cells to reduce remodeling by increasing the parathyroid hormone
5. Sedentary lifestyle

\author{

}

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS}
6. Endocrine disorders of the thyroid \& parathyroid glands.
7. Eating disorders
8. Cigarette smoking
9. Insufficient dietary calcium
10. Long term use of corticosteroids (decreases collagen synthesis \& increase collagen breakdown).

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS}

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}
1. Maybe asymptomatic until x-ray films demonstrate skeletal weakening.
2. Spinal deformity \& dowager's hump resulting from repeated pathological, spinal vertebral fractures.
3. Spinal fractures may occur spontaneously or as a result of minimal trauma.

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS}
4. Chronic low thoracic \& midline back pain
5. Height loss may precipitate thoracic problems, decrease in abdominal capacity, \& decrease in exercise tolerance.
6. Hip fractures \& vertebral column collapse are the most debilitating problems.

\section*{DIAGNOSTICS}

Serum calcium, phosphorus, \& alkaline phosphatase \& PTH are usually normal

\section*{OSTEOPORISIS}
2. CT Scan or bone density scan to evaluate bone loss.

\section*{MEDICAL MANAGEMENT}
1. Medications: calcium supplements, vit. D supplements, estrogen replacement therapy \& medications that facilitate increased bone density.
2. Dietary: increased intake of protein, calcium \& vit. D.

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS}
3. Exercise: activities that put moderate stress on bones working them against gravity (walking, racquet sports, jogging).
4. Compression fractures of the vertebrae usually heal with surgical intervention.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTION}
1. pain relief; bedrest; firm mattress \& narcotic analgesic initially, followed by non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs.

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS}
2. Assess bowel \& bladder function, patient will be prone to constipation \& paralytic ileus if vertebrae are involved.
3. Regular daily exercise; encourage outdoor exercise (to increase the utilization of vit. D)
4. Increased calcium intake \& estrogen therapy.
5. Education:-decrease falls \& injury by maintaining safe home environment

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS}
- understand the need to continue taking medication even if they do not make the patient feel better, they prevent further damage.
- do not exercise if pain occurs.
- avoid heavy lifting, stooping \& bending. Review \& demonstrate good body mechanics with the client.

OSTEOPOROSIS

\section*{PREVENTION}
1. Diet adequate in protein, calories, calcium \& vit. D.
2. Calcium \& vit. D supplements \& exercise for those at risk.
3. Consider hormonal replacement for hypogonadal men \& women.
4. Consider biphosphate if pt is on corticosteroids for more than 2 weeks \& for prevention of osteoporosis.

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS}
5. Give calcium supplement with meals to reduce risk of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.
COMPLICATION
Bone fracture occurring in the vertebral bodies, distal radius or hip.

\section*{BONE TUMOURS}

\section*{TUMOR-abnormal swelling due to rapid growth of tissue which may be benign or malignant TYPES}
a. Osteogenic- of bone origin
b. Chondronic- of cartilage origin
c. Fibrogenic- from fibrous tissue
d. Rhabdomyogenic- of muscular origin
e. Others are marrow (reticulum), nerve, vascular \& fatty cell tumors.
- Could be primary or metastatic tumor.

\section*{BONE TUMOURS}

\section*{BENIGN BONE TUMOURS-}
> They do not metastasize to other tissues.Are more common than malignant primary bone tumours.
' Generally are slow growing \& well circumscribed, present few symptoms, \& are not a cause of death.
- Examples:- osteochondroma, bone cyst, fibroma.
- Some benign tumors such as giant cell tumors (osteoclastoma) have the potential of undergoing malignant transformation.

\section*{BONE TUMOUR}

\section*{MALIGNANT BONE TUMOURS}
> Primary malignant musculoskeletal tumours are relatively rare \& arise from connective \& supportive tissue cells (sarcomas) or bone marrow elements (myelomas).
> Malignant primary musculoskeletal tumours include osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma \& fibrosarcoma.

\section*{BONE TUMOURS}
- Soft tissue sarcomas include liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma.
> Osteogenic sarcoma (osteosarcoma) is the most common \& most often fatal malignant bone tumour. The tumour carries a high mortality rate because the sarcoma often has spread to the lungs by the time pt seeks healthcare. Long bone is often affected.

\section*{METASTATIC BONE DISEASE}
> More common than any primary bone tumour.
> From elsewhere the most common primary sites of tumors that metastasize to bone include the kidney, prostate, lung, breast, ovary \& thyroid.

\section*{BONE TUMOURS}

\section*{RISK FACTORS}
1. Male between 10-25 years
2. Older people with paget's disease
3. A result of radiation exposure

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}

A tumour causes normal bone tissue to react by osteolytic response (bone destruction) or osteoblastic response (bone formation). Primary tumours cause bone destruction, which

\section*{BONE TUMOURS}

Weakens the bone, resulting in bone fractures.
The bones surface changes \& the contour enlarges in the tumor area.
Malignant bone tumors spreads in blood along the walls of the veins. This invade \& destroy adjacent bone tissue \& benign bone tumors place pressure on adjacent bone tissue. This weakens the structure of the bone until it can no longer withstand the stress of ordinary use. Pathologic fractures commonly result.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATION}
1. Varying degrees of disability
2. Weight loss
3. Malaise
4. Fever
5. Spinal cord compression (spinal metastasis)
6. Palpable, tender, \& fixed bone mass.

\section*{BONE TUMOURS}

\section*{DIAGNOSTICS}
1. History \& physical examination
2. Diagnostic studies: CT Scan, bone scan, myelogram, arteriography, MRI, biopsy, \& CXR.
TREATMENT
1. Amputation of extremity \&/or extensive surgical resection of bone \& surrounding tissue.
2. Chemotherapy
3. Radiotherapy NURSING INTERVENTION (post excision of tumor)
1. Pain relieve: pharmacologic \& nonpharmacologic pain mx. Work with pt for effective pain mx regime increasing pt control.

\section*{BONE TUMOURS}
2. Wound care as healing maybe delayed because of surgery \& radiotherapy. Minimize pressure on wound.
3. Adequate nutrition, address anorexia, nausea \& vomiting post chemotherapy \& radiotherapy.
4. Prevent wound infection- antibiotics \& aseptic wound dressing techniques. If pt is on chemotherapy monitor WBC.
5. Give psychological care.
6. physiotherapy.
7. Teach on meds, dressing, treatment regimen, physical \& occupational therapy programs, \& complications.

\section*{SKELETAL TUBERCULOSIS}
- It is caused by dissemination of bacilli via the blood stream early in the course of the initial infection.
- In some cases spread to bone appears to result from lymphatic drainage from another infected area such as the pleura or kidney.
> May smolder for years before being discovered.

\section*{SKELETAL TUBERCULOSIS}
- Basic lesions almost always is a combination of osteomyelitis \& athritis.
- In adults, skeletal tuberculosis usually occurs in weight- bearing joints; spine, hip \& knees.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}
- An inflammatory reaction is followed by formation of granulation tissue that begins to erode \& destroy cartilage \& eventually cancellous bone, ultimately leading to demineralization \&

\section*{SKELETAL TUBERCULOSIS}

Necrosis. The healing process involves deposition of fibrous tissue.
PRESENTATION
1. Multiple osteolytic lesions.
2. Pain
3. Slight narrowing of vertebral space.
4. Later vertebral body destruction with collapse \& formation of kyphosis \& scoliosis

\section*{SKELETAL TUBERCULOSIS}

\section*{POTT'S DISEASE (TUBERCULOSIS SPONDULOSIS)}
- This is TB of the spine.
- Half of the cases of skeletal tuberculosis occur in the spine.
- Infectious process begins in the anterior part of a vertebral body.
- The disk space between two involved vertebrae is usually destroyed, producing the characteristic anterior wedging of two involved vertebrae with loss of intervening disk space.

\section*{SKELETAL TUBERCULOSIS}
- The resulting deformity may produce a characteristic posterior prominence of the spine
- Thoracic spine is involved most frequently
' Lumber spine is next, \& cervical \& sacral spines least often.

\section*{POTT'S ABSCESS \& SINUS FORMATION}
' Pus from a vertebral focus ruptures anteriorly, enveloping the spine \& producing a paraspinal abscess

\section*{SKELETAL TUBERCULOSIS}
- Since it is confined by tight ligamentous investments, it can develop higher pressure, dissect along tissue planes for long distance, \& present as a mass in the supraclavicular space, above the posterior iliac crest in the petit's triangle the groin, the buttock, or even the popliteal fossa.
- Cases of Pott's abcess perforating into the bowel have been reported, resulting in a gas-filled psoas

\section*{SKELETAL TUBERCULOSIS}
visible on x-ray films.
- Rupture into adjacent lung has been observed.
- The abscess can spread infection to other vertebral bodies, sometimes with intervening normal spine.
POTT'S PARAPLEGIA
- Paralysis of lower extremities can develop in several ways.

\section*{SKELETAL TUBERCULOSIS}
- Pressure in a paraspinal abscess can produce ischemic changes in the subjacent cord.
- In such cases neurologic symptoms are promptly relieved by drainage of the abscess.
- Caseous or granulating tissue may extrude from the posterior aspect of the vertebral body \& impinge on the anterior aspect of the cord.
- Inflammatory thrombosis of the anterior spine artery can occur.

\section*{SKELETAL TUBERCULOSIS}
> Sudden cord transections(injury) may result from serious loss of structural integrity.

\section*{INVESTIGATIONS}
1. Tuberculin test: precise intracutaneous injection producing a raised, blanched wheal. The reaction is read in $48-72 \mathrm{hrs}$, a positive test defined as greater than 10 mm of induration.

\section*{SKELETAL TUBERCULOSIS}
2. Tissue or pus culture \& specify of microorganism.
3. CT spine, MRI, x-ray

\section*{TREATMENT}
1. Bed rest to relief pain
2. Drainage or debridement of large paraspinal abscesses if they are causing paraplegia or paraparesis

\section*{SKELETAL TUBERCULOSIS}
3. Prolonged treatment (2 years) with an INH (isoniazid)- containing regimen is indicated \& many advise including RMP (rifampicin) for 9 months.
4. Advanced neurologic defects \& severe anatomic instability of the spine require more radical orthopedic approaches.

\section*{ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS}
- Ankylosis is fixation or immobility of a joint.
- Ankylosing spondylitis affects the cartilaginous joints of the spine \& surrounding tissues. Occasionally, the large synovial joints, such as hips, knees or shoulders, maybe involved.
- It is usually diagnosed in the second or third decade of life.

\section*{ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS}
- The disease is not usually as severe in females as in males, in whom the disease is more prevalent \& likely to have significant systemic involvement.
CLINICAL MANIFESTATION
1. Low back pain which improves with exercise.
2. Early morning stiffness or stiffness after immobility.

\section*{ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS}
3. Enthesitis (inflammation at points of insertion of ligaments \& tendons) \& occurs as heel, plantar or chest pain.
DIAGNOSTICS
Diagnosis is too often delayed by $8-10 \mathrm{yrs}$ because of increased prevalence of back pain in community.

\section*{ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS}
1. ESR \& CRP not always elevated, radiographs will be normal in early disease.

\section*{OSTEOMYELITIS}
' An infection of the bone, bone marrow \& surrounding soft tissue.
- Causation organisms are staph. Aureus (70-80 \%), Proteus, psuedomonas \& E. Coli.

OSTEOMYELITIS

\section*{RISK FACTORS.}
1. Indirect entry of organism
a) Hematogenic
b) Injury \& infection of adjacent soft tissue.
2. Direct injury to bone:
a) Trauma
b) Surgical procedures.

\section*{OSTEOMYELITIS}

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}

Inflammatory response occurs initially, with increased vascularization \& edema. After 2 or 3 days, thrombosis of the blood vessels occurs resulting in ischemia with bone necrosis. The infection extends into the medullary cavity \& under the periosteum \& may spread into adjacent soft tissues \& joints. Without prompt

\section*{OSTEOMYELITIS}
treatment bone abscesses form which contains dead bone tissue (sequestrum) that does not easily liquify \& drain. New bone growth (involucrum) forms \& surrounds the sequestrum. Although healing appears to take place, achronically infected sequestrum remains \& produces recurring abscesses throughout the the pt's life. This is referred to as chronic osteomyelitis.

OSTEOMYELITIS

CLASSIFICATION
Acute osteomyelitis: sudden onset, may heal in 2 to 3 weeks or progress to chronic status.
Chronic osteomyelitis: a continuous, persistent problem or exacerbation of previous problem.

OSTEOMYELITIS

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATION}
1. Acute
a) Tenderness, swelling \& warmth in affected area.
b) Drainage from infected site.
c) Fever, chills
d) Constant pain in affected area.
e) Circulatory impairment
2. Chronic
a) Drainage from wound or sinus tract
b) Recurrent episodes of bone pain
c) Low grade fever
d) Remission \& exacerbation of problem.

OSTEOMYELITIS

\section*{DIAGNOSTICS}
1. Wound culture, blood culture to identify appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Radionuclide bone scan , MRI for early definitive diagnosis.
3. X-ray plate only shows soft tissue swelling till after 2 weeks.
4. Bone or soft tissue biopsy.

OSTEOMYELITIS

\section*{TREATMENT}
1. Intensive IV antibiotics therapy 3 to 6 weeks.
2. Immobilization of the affected area.
3. Surgical debridement may be necessary with antibiotic beads impregnated i.e sequestrectomy (removal of enough involucrum to enable removal of sequestrum)

OSTEOMYELITIS

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTION}
1. Administration of antibiotics, analgesics
2. Prevent contractures especially of the affected extremity.
3. Care of open wounds \& some pts are isolated
4. Education on drug compliance because they are going to take antibiotics for a long time, infection control measures \& keeping follow-up appointments.

OSTEOMYELITIS

PREVENTION
1. Treatment of focal infections diminishes hematogenous spread.
2. Post pone elective orthopedic surgery if pt has recurrent infection e.g UTI, sore throat or history of a recent infection.
3. Prophylactic antibiotics with invasive procedures on pts with joint replacement surgery.
4. Asepsis during orthopedic surgery.
5. Aseptic post op wound care.

\section*{CONTUSION}
- Is a soft tissue injury produced by blunt force e.g a blow, kick or fall. Many small blood vessels rupture \& bleed into soft tissues (ecchymosis/ bruising). A hematoma develops when the bleeding is sufficient to cause an appreciable collection of blood.
' Local symptoms (pain, swelling \& discoloration) are controlled with intermittent application of cold.
> Most contusions resolve in 1-2 weeks.

\section*{STRAIN}
- Is a "muscle pull" from over use, overstretching, or excessive stress.
- Strains are microscopic, incomplete muscle tears with some bleeding into the tissue.
> Patient experiences soreness or sudden pain with local tenderness upon muscle use \& isometric contraction

\section*{SPRAIN}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_683a8d02447446e789a3g-102.jpg?height=945&width=1943&top_left_y=577&top_left_x=266)

\section*{SPRAIN}
- Is an injury to ligaments surrounding a joint, caused by a wrenching or twisting motion.
- The function of a ligament is to maintain stability while permitting mobility.
> A torn ligament loses stabilizing ability.
' Blood vessels rupture \& edema occurs, the joint is tender \& movement becomes painful.
- The degree of disability \& pain increases during the first 2-3 hrs after the injury because of the associated swelling \& bleeding.

\section*{SPRAIN}
- The patient should have an x-ray to evaluate for bone injury.
- Avulsion fracture (a bone fragment is pulled away by a ligament or tendon) may be associated with a sprain.

\section*{TREATMENT (CONTUSION, STRAIN \& SPRAIN)}
$\square$ Resting (prevent further injury \& promote healing) \& elevating the affected part (control swelling)
$\square$ Apply cold (ice) (produces vasoconstriction which reduces bleeding \& edema)
Note: acronyme RICE- Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation.
$\square$ Monitor neurovascular status (circulation, motion, sensation).
$\square$ After the first 48 hrs of acute inflammation stage heat may be applied to promote vasodilation, absorption \& repair.
$\square$ Exercise after 2 or more days depending on the severity of injury.

\section*{JOINT DISLOCATION}
- Is a condition in which the articulate surfaces of bones forming the joint are no longer in anatomic contact.
- The bones are literally "out of joint".
- A subluxation is a partial dislocation of the articulating surfaces.
- Traumatic dislocations are orthopedic emergency. Otherwise vascular necrosis \& nerve palsy may occur.
- Dislocations may be congenital (hip), spontaneous or pathological or traumatic.

\section*{SIGNS \& SYMPTOMS OF A TRAUMATIC DISLOCATION}
1. Pain
2. Change in contour of the joint
3. Change in the length of extremity
4. Loss of normal mobility
5. Change in axis of the dislocated bones.

\section*{JOINT DISLOCATION}

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
' X-ray confirms diagnosis \& demonstrates possible associated fractures.

\section*{MEDICAL MANAGEMENT}
1. Immobilization of the joint while pt is transported to hospital.
2. Prompt reduction to preserve joint function
3. Joint immobilization by bandages, splints, casts or traction.

\section*{JOINT DISLOCATION}
4. Monitor neurovascular status.
5. After several days to weeks passive \& active movement 3-4 times a day is began to preserve ROM. Support joint between the exercise.

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT}
a. Promote comfort, evaluate neurovascular status, \& protecting joint during healing.
b. Teach pt to manage immobilizing devices \& how to protect joint from injury.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_683a8d02447446e789a3g-111.jpg?height=320&width=476&top_left_y=666&top_left_x=1159)

\section*{DEFINITION}
- A disruption or break in the continuity of the bone.
- Usually as a result of a traumatic injury

Characteristics of bones in children affecting fracture \& fracture healing.
a) Presence of epiphyseal plate; if damaged, may affect the growth of the long bone.
b) Periosteum is thicker \& stronger \& has an increased blood supply; therefore healing is more rapid.
c) Bones are more porous \& allow for greater flexibility.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF FRACTURES}
1. According to pattern of fracture
a) Complete: fracture line extends through the entire bone; the periosteum is disrupted on both sides of the bone.
b) Incomplete: fracture line extends only partially through the bone (greenstick, hairline).
c) Comminuted: fracture with multiple bone fragments; more common in adults.
d) Impacted: complete fracture in which bone fragments are driven into each other.

\section*{FRACTURES}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_683a8d02447446e789a3g-114.jpg?height=1223&width=2303&top_left_y=377&top_left_x=76)
2. According to location of the fracture
a) Proximal
b) Middle
c) Distal
3. Stable vs Unstable fractures.
a) Stable: a portion of the periosteum remains intact; frequently transverse, spiral or greenstick fractures.
b) Unstable: bones are displaced at the time of injury, with poor approximation; frequently comminuted or impacted.

\section*{4. Simple vs Complex fractures.}
a) Simple, closed fracture: does not produce a break in the skin.
b) Complex, open or compound fracture: involves an open wound through which the bone has protruded
5. Anatomic location (colles \& potts fractures)
a) Colles': fracture within the last inch of the distal radius, distal fragment is displaced in a position of dorsal \& medial deviation.
b) Potts': fracture of distal fibula, seriously disrupting the tibio-fibular articulation, a piece of medial melleolus may be chipped off as a result of rupture of internal ligaments.

2. Trauma
3. Congenital conditions
4. Spontaneous

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS \\ 1. Edema around the injured site.}
2. Severe pain
3. Abnormal positioning of the extremity
4. Loss of normal function
5. False movement; movement occurs at the fracture site, bone should not move except at joints.
6. Crepitation: palpable or audible crunching as the ends of the bone rub together.
7. Discolouration of the skin around the affected area.
8. Sensation may be impaired if there is nerve damage.

\section*{1. Clinical manifestations \& history \\ 2. X-ray film of involved area.}

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
1. IMMEDIATE IMMOBILIZATION
- Suspected fracture area restricted from moving.
2. FRACTURE REDUCTION
a) Closed reduction: nonsurgical, manual realignment of the bones, then injured extremity is placed in a cast for continued immobilization until healing occurs.
b) Open reduction: surgical correction of alignment.
3. FIXATION DEVICES
a) External fixation- application of a rigid external device consisting of pins placed through the bone \& held in place by a metalic frame, requires meticulous care of pin insertion site.
b) Internal fixation (ORIF open reduction, internal fixation): done through an open incision, \& a hardware (pins, plates, rods, screws) is placed in the bone.
c) Both methods

\section*{INTERNAL FIXATION DEVICES}

Lateral skeletal traction

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT}
1. Immobilize fractured extremity \& provide emergency care before transporting victim.
a) Evaluate circulation distal to injury
b) If pulses are not present or if the extremity must be realigned to apply splint for transfer, apply just enough traction to support \& immobilize the fractured extremity in a position of the proper alignment.
c) Splint \& immobilize extremity before transfer.

Note: traction to compound fractures may cause more damage.
d) Elevate the affected extremity, if possible, to decrease edema.

\section*{2. Identify complications early}

Perform frequent peripheral nerve \& vascular assessments distal to the area of injury or cast.
a) Impaired blood flow:
$\square$ pulselessness, pale skin \& cool to touch, pain, swelling, edema distal to injury or cast, capillary refill $>3 \mathrm{sec}$.
b) Compartment syndrome.
- Significant increase in pain not responding to analgesic.
- Loss of movement \& sensation distal to cast.
- Skin is pale \& cool to touch.
- Edema distal to injury or cast.
- Pulses may be present initially.
- Notify physician immediately.
c) Nerve damage from excess pressure.
- Paresthesia; numbness distal to injury or cast.
- Motor paralysis of previously functioning muscles.
- Feeling of deep pain \& pressure.
d) Infection:
$\square$ May occur within the cast i.e unpleasant odor, purulent drainage, fever, \& increased warmth over cast.
3. Immobilize by cast (intermediate- Long-term).
a) Plaster cast: allow cast to dry adequately before handling or moving the pt i.e
- Do not cover the cast with a blanket
- Encourage drying of casts using funs \& maintaining adequate circulation.
- Avoid handling wet cast to prevent indentations in the cast, which may precipitate pressure areas inside the cast
- Reposition pt every 2 hrs to increase drying on all cast surfaces.
- "petaling" the cast is done to cover the rough edges \& prevent crumbling of the plaster cast; edges are covered with small strips of waterproof adhesive
- Do not allow cast to become wet or excessively damp

Note: do not apply any form of heat to dry the cast.
b) Synthetic casts (fiberglass, polyester cotton knit) are lighter \& require a minimal amount of drying time.
- Frequently used for upper body cast
- Preferable for infants or children.
- Cast does not crumble around the edges \& does not soil as easily.
- Cast dries rapidly when it gets dump, \& it does not disintergrate in water; some synthetic casts can be immersed for bathing.
c) Body jacket cast \& hip spica cast.
- Evaluate abdominal discomfort caused by cast compression of mesenteric artery against duodenum.
- Relief of abdominal pressure can be achieved by means of NGT suction or cast removal \& reapplication.
- Evaluate for pressure areas over iliac crest.
4. Immobilization via traction.
a) Assume that traction is continuous unless otherwise ordered.
b) Carefully assess for skin breakdown especially under the pt.
c) Do not change or remove traction weight on a pt with continuous traction.
d) The traction ropes \& weights should hang free from any obstruction
e) Traction applied in one direction requires an equal counter-traction to be effective
f) Do not let the pt's feet touch the edge of the bed, this will cause the counter traction to be lost.
g) Do not allow the traction weights to rest on anything
h) Carefully assess the pin sites (skeletal traction) for early recognition of complications e.g Osteomyelitis

\section*{Remember!!}

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF TRACTION}
1. Patient must be in correct body alignment at center of bed
2. Traction is maintained continuously, unless otherwise specified
3. Continuously maintain counter traction
4. All ropes must move freely on the pulley at all times
5. Rope knots should never touch the pulley
6. Ropes should be kept clear of bed linens/other objects
7. Weights must always hang freely
8. Skeletal traction must never be released

\section*{5. Prevent complications}
5. From of immobility e.g venous stasis, thrombosis, pneumonia, contipation, UTI, decubitus ulcers, increased blood calcium leading to renal stones.
6. From internal or external fixation.
- Inspect exposed skin \& pin sites for infection
- Cleanse around pin sites
- Perform wound care on incision area or area of trauma.
$\square$ Observe carefully for development of an infection
- Evaluate for circulatory \& neurosensory impairment.
6. Education
a. Patient should not:
- Bear weight on the affected extremity until allowed
- Allow the cast to get wet.
- Insert anything under or in the cast
- Move or manipulate pins on an external fixator device.
b. Patient should:
- Assess pin sites for evidence of infection.
- Report symptoms associated with swelling or an increase in pain-unrelieved by analgesic.

\section*{SPECIFIC SITE FRACTURES}
- RIBS
- HUMERAL NECK
- HUMERAL SHAFT
- PELVIS
- HIP
- FEMORAL SHAFT
- TIBIA-FIBULAR
- THORACOLUMBAR SPINE

\section*{FRACTURE RIBS}
$\square$ Uncomplicated fractures heal 3 to 6 weeks without residue impairment
$\square$ Painful respirations cause pts breathing to be more shallow \& coughing to be restrained, this precipitates building up of secretions \& decreased ventilation.
$\square$ Multiple rib fractures may cause pnuemothorax.
$\square$ Nurse assists the pt to splint chest while coughing \& deep breathing to prevent pneumonia \& atelectasis.
$\square$ Occasionally intercostal nerve blocks may be administered to relieve pain \& permit productive coughing.
$\square$ Chest taping or strapping is not usually done because it decreases thoracic excursion. NECK
$\square$ May occur through anatomical or the surgical neck of the humerus.
Impact fractures common in the elderly after a fall.
Are essentially nondisplaced fractures.
Active middle aged pts may suffer severely displaced humeral neck fractures with associated rotator calf muscle damage.

\section*{MANAGEMENT FRACTURE HUMERAL NECK}
1. Nondisplaced fracture is supported \& immobilized by a sling \& swathe that secure the supported arm to the trunk.
2. Require 6-10 wks to heal \& pt should avoid vigorous activity for another 4 wks.
Residual stiffness, aching \& some limitation of ROM may persist for 6 or more months.
3. Displaced humeral neck fracture may need closed reduction, ORIF, or humeral head prosthesis.
4. Limitation of motion \& stiffness of the shoulder occur from disuse.
- Pendulum or circumduction exercises are done after period of immobilization (Pt. leans forward \& allows affected arm to abduct \& rotate).

Frequently caused by:
a) Direct trauma resulting in transverse, oblique or comminuted fracture.
b) Indirect twisting force that results in a spiral fracture. The nerves \& brachial blood vessels may be injured with these fractures. Wrist drop indicates radial nerve injury.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
1. Hanging cast

Provides traction to the arm when the pt is upright hence reducing \& immobilizing the fracture.
- Must be independent (free from support)
- Sleep in upright position so that traction is maintained.
- Watch out for complication-non-union.
- Finger \& pendulum shoulder exercise start as soon as possible
- Need 10 weeks to heal with hanging cast.
- After cast removal, a sling is applied \& exercise of wrist, elbow, \& shoulder started.
2. Functional bracing.

A contoured thermoplastic sleeve is secured in place with interlocking fabric closures around the upper arm immobilizing the reduced fracture.
3. Shoulder spica cast: may be used during early treatment of unstable humerus fracture.
4. Skeletal traction: may be used for pts who must remain in bed because of their injuries.
5. Open fractures are treated by external fixators.
6. ORIF is necessary with nerve palsy or pathologic fractures

\section*{FRACTURE PELVIS}

The sacrum, ilium, pubis, \& ischium bones form the pelvic bone, a fused, stable, bony ring in adults.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_683a8d02447446e789a3g-160.jpg?height=1171&width=2074&top_left_y=467&top_left_x=242)

\section*{CAUSES OF PELVIC FRACTURE}
$\square$ Falls, crush injuries
$\square$ At least $2 / 3$ are associated with multiple injuries.
$\square$ High mortality rate associated with hemorrhage, pulmonary complications, fat emboli, intravascular coagulation, thromboembolic complications, \& infection.

\section*{MANIFESTATIONS OF PELVIC FRACTURE}
$\square$ Ecchymosis
$\square$ Tenderness over the symphysis pubis, anterior iliac spine, iliac crest, sacrum or coccyx.
$\square$ Local swelling
$\square$ Numbness or tingling of pubis, genitalia, \& proximal thighs.
$\square$ Inability to bear weight without discomfort.

\section*{TYPES OF PELVIC FRACTURES}

\section*{1. Stable pelvic fractures}
$\square$ May include fractures of a single pubic or ischial ramus; ipsilateral pubic \& ischial rami; pelvic wing of ilium (Duverney's fracture); or fracture of the sacrum or coccyx.
$\square$ Treated with a few days of bed rest \& symptom management until the pain \& discomfort are controlled.
$\square$ Most heal rapidly because the hip is made up mostly of cancellous bone, with rich blood supply.
$\square$ Ambulation is resumed using ambulatory aids for protected weight bearing.
2. Unstable pelvic fractures

May be any of three (3) types
i. Rotationally unstable: from lateral or AP compression. e.g. open book type (separation at the symphysis pubis)
ii. Vertically unstable e.g. vertical shear type (superior-inferior displacement of the pelvic sides).
ii. A combination of both.

Treatment: External fixation or ORIF
3. Vertical shear pelvic fractures
Involves the anterior \& posterior pelvic ring with vertical displacement, usually through the sacro-iliac joint with disruption of ligaments.
Management: External fixation with or without skeletal traction \& ORIF.
4. Fracture acetabulum
Often seen after motor vehicle crashes in which the femur is jammed into the dashboard.
$\square$ Management: depends on the pattern of fractures; (traction, open reduction, orthoplasty).

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
a) Clinical manifestations
b) X-ray
c) CT-scan: sacroiliac joint disruption, soft tissue trauma, hematoma, \& fractures.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
1. Check for possible hemorrhage from torn iliac artery \& shock occurance- palpate pulses.
2. Peritoneal lavage may be done to detect intra-abdominal hemorrhage.
3. Assess for injuries to the bladder, rectum, intestines, other abdominal organs, \& pelvic vessels \& nerves.
4. Assess injury to urinary tract by urinalysis.
5. Avoid urethral catheter till status of the urethra is known.
6. Exercises (ROM, \& strengthening), elastic stockings \& elevation of the foot of the bed to aid venous return and diminish the effects of bed rest.
7. Pt. may be mobilized with progressive weight bearing, usually with crutches.

\section*{LONGTERM COMPLICATIONS}
1. Malunion
2. Nonunion
3. Residual gait disturbances
4. Back pain from ligament injury

RISK FACTORS (соммовіdities)
1. Osteoporosis especially in elderly women.
2. Weak quadriceps muscles also age related
3. Conditions that produce decreased cerebral arterial perfusion (TIA, anemia, emboli, cardiovascular disease, effects of medications).

All attribute to incidence of falls in elderly people.

\section*{There are two (2) types of hip fractures.}
a) Intracapsular fractures: head and neck of the femur.
May damage the vascular system denying nutrient supply \& bone may die Nonunion or aseptic necrosis is
b) Extracapsular fractures: trochanteric region \& subtrochanteric region. Have an excellent blood , \& heal readily.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATION}
1. With fractures of the femoral neck: leg is shortened, adducted, \& externally rotated. Pt most comfortable with leg slightly flexed in external rotation.
2. Impacted femoral neck fractures: moderate discomfort even on movement, may allow Pt. to bear weight, no obvious shortening or rotational changes.
3. Extracapsular femoral fractures: significantly shortened extremity, greater external rotation, muscle spasms, large hematoma or ecchymosis.

DIAGNOSIS
X-ray.
CT scan

MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
1. Temporary skin traction (Buck's extension)
2. ORIF
3. Replacement of the femoral head with a prosthesis (hemiarthroplasty).

\section*{SELF-CARE AFTER FEMORAL-HEAD PROSTHESIS}

\section*{Do Not}
- Force hip into greater than 90 degrees of flexion*
- Force hip into adduction
- Force hip into internal rotation
- Cross legs
- Put on own shoes or stockings until 8 wk after surgery without adaptive device (e.g., long-handled shoehorn or stocking-helper)

- Inform dentist of presence of prosthesis before dental work so that prophylactic antibiotics can be given

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}
1. Neurovascular complications
a) Direct injury to nerves \& blood vessels or tissues (pressure).
b) DVT
2. Pulmonary complications: pneumonia
3. Skin breakdown: blisters from tape, pressure ulcer.
4. Infection
5. Nonunion
6. Avascular necrosis
7. Fixation device problem (protrusion of the fixation device through the acetabulum; loosening of hardware.

\section*{Total Hip Replacement}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_683a8d02447446e789a3g-179.jpg?height=1262&width=2104&top_left_y=279&top_left_x=161)

\section*{SHAFT}
$\square$ Great force is required in adults for this fracture to occur.
$\square$ May be transverse, oblique, spiral or comminuted.
$\square$ Massive blood loss common leading to shock.

\section*{SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS}
1. Enlarged, deformed, painful thigh.
2. Can not move hip or knee.

\section*{ASSESSMENT \& DIAGNOSIS}
1. Neurovascular status check
2. Doppler ultrasound to assess blood flow
3. X-rays: associated dislocation of the hip \& knee.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
1. Neurovascular monitoring.
2. Skin traction for comfort \& immobilization of the fracture to minimize soft tissue injury.
3. Generally, skeletal traction for muscle relaxation \& alignment of the fracture fragments before ORIF.
4. In ORIF: intramedullary nailing devices, interlocking nail, or compression plate \& screws provide adequate internal fixation.
5. Active muscle movement enhances healing.
6. Fractures of the middle \& distal shaft (supracondylar). May be managed with skeletal traction after 2-4 weeks.
7. When pain \& swelling have subsided skeletal traction is removed \& a cast brace placed
Complication: Restriction of knee motion due to lack of early exercise.

\section*{FRACTURE TIBIA \& FIBULA}
$\square$ Results from a direct blow, falls with foot in a flexed position or a violent twisting.
$\square$ Usually occur in association with each other.

\section*{ASSESSMENT \& DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS}
1. Assess nerve damage: inability to dorsiflex great toe with diminished sensation in the first web space.
2. Tibial artery damage: assess skin colour, temperature \& capillary refill.
3. Monitor anterior compartment syndrome: pain unrelieved by analgesics \& increasing with plantar flexion, \& paresthesia.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
1. Pins-in-plaster technique.
2. Closed tibial fractures: closed reduction in long leg-walking or patellar-tendon-bearing cast.
3. Partial weight bearing after 7-10 days.
4. Cast changed to short leg cast or brace in 3-4 wks to allow knee motion.
5. Healing takes 6-10 wks.
6. Comminuted fractures may need skeletal traction or fixation (internal/external).
7. Continue neurovascular assessment and limb elevation.

FRACTURE THORACOLUMBAR SPINE
May involve
1. Vertebral body
2. Lamina \& articulating process
3. Spinous process or transverse processes
$\square \mathrm{T}_{12}-\mathrm{L}_{2}$ are most vulnerable to fractures.
$\square$ Generally due to indirect trauma caused by excessive loading, sudden muscle contraction, or excessive motion beyond physiologic limits.
$\square$ Osteoporosis contributes to vertebral body collapse.

\section*{SIGNS \& SYMPTOMS}
$\square$ Acute tenderness
$\square$ Swelling
$\square$ Paravertebral muscle spasm
$\square$ Change in normal curves or gaps btn. spinous processes.

Note: Immobilization is essential till initial determination of spinal cord injury \& fracture stability.
$\square$ Stable fractures are due to flexion, extension, lateral bending, or vertical loading.
$\square$ Few spinal fractures are associated neurologic deficit which require immediate surgery (laminectomy with spinal fusion) to decompress the spinal cord
$\square$ Unstable fractures occur with fracture dislocation \& exhibit disruption of both anterior \& posterior structural columns. The potential for neural damage exists.

\section*{MED-SURG MANAGEMENT}
1. Stable: conservative mgt. with limited bedrest, with the head of bed <300, till acute pain subsides
2. Pain management; Analgesics
3. Assess for paralytic ilius because of associated retroperitoneal haemorrhage
4. Begin ambulation early slowly
5. Avoid having Pt. bend, stoop, twist, sit, or lift.
5. A spinal brace or thoracolumbar orthosis may be applied for support during progressive ambulation \& resumption of activities.
6. Weigh reduction
7. With unstable fracture, maintain bed rest with special turning device (eg stryker frame) to maintain spinal alignment.
8. Neurological observation
9. Unstable fractures: open reduction, decompression \& fixation with spinal fusion \& instrument stabilization.

PRE-OPERATIVE NURSING CARE
1. Perform pre-op general nursing care
2. Practice log rolling \& voiding from supine position.
3. Discuss post-op pain \& methods to decrease pain.
4. Evaluate specific pain characteristics for post-op reference.
5. Evaluate bowel \& bladder function.
6. Establish a baseline neurological assessment for post-op reference.

POST-OP CARE (LAMINECTOMY) Laminectomy:
surgical removal of the herniated portion of the disk.
1. Keep the bed in a flat position.
2. Log rolling pt when turning
3. Keep pillows between the legs when client is positioned on the side.
4. Pt post microlaminectomy has fewer mobility, often they may assume a position of comfort.
5. Maintain homeostasis \& assess for complications post laminectomy.
a. Assess incision area for leakage of CSF \& bleeding.
b. Analgesic via PCA pump or epidural catheter
6. Start mobilization with assistance of physiotherapist

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

Orthopedics is the branch of medicine that deals with disorders or deformities of the skeletal system and associated muscles, joints and ligaments.

Orthopedic Nursing is a specialty focused on prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders using the appropriate and scientific based nursing care.

ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OVERVIEW

\section*{ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OVERVIEW}

The Musculoskeletal system function is interdependent with other body systems

The bony skeleton provides a supportive framework for body structures.

Bones also stores $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (98\%), Phosphorous, magnesium and fluoride ions.

\section*{Anatomy and Physiology Overview cont'd}
- Red bone marrow produce red and white blood cells (Hematopoiesis)
- Joints hold bones together and allow movement.
- Muscles attached to bones helps moves bones and aid in heat production (maintain body temperature)

\section*{Anat... and Physio... cont'd}

\section*{Bone Cell Types:}
(i) Osteoblasts for bone formation
(ii) Osteocytes for bone maintenance
(iii) Osteoclasts for destroying, resorbing and remodeling bone substance

\section*{Other related concepts}

\section*{Ligaments}

Ligaments are parallel bands of flexible, dense fibrous connective tissue whose primary function is to connect the articular ends of bones and provide stability.

They permit movement in some directions but limit movement in other directions hence preventing joint injury, as is the case with knee and hip joints.

Ligaments also attach to soft uissue to suspend structures e.g. the Suspensory ligament of the ovaries.

\section*{Tendons}

Tendons are bands of dense fibrous tissues forming the origin and insertion of muscles.

They are aligned with sheaths, which is again lined with synovial membrane that provide lubrication for each tendon movement.

The sheaths enclose certain tendons especially in the wrist and ankle.

\section*{Fascia}

This is a sheet of loose connective tissue that may be found directly under the skin as superficial fascia or as a sheet of dense fibrous connective tissue making up a sheath of muscles, nerves and blood supply.

\section*{Bursae}

Are small sacs of connective tissue located whenever pressure is exerted over moving parts, hence preventing injury to muscle tendons.

Bursae are lined with synovial membranes and contain synovial fluid, which some ac cuchion between the moving parts.

\section*{Joints}

Are of three major types:
(i) Fibrous (Synarthroses) joints: Allows no movement at all e.g. the sutures of the Skull.
(ii) Amphiarthroses (Cartilaginous) joints: Allows little movement e.g. the intervertebral joints and the joints at the pubic symphysis.
(iii) Diathroses (Synovial): Allows free movements e.g. the mmaints.

\section*{Factors affecting bone formation}
1. Factors influencing/responsible for bone formation:

Calcium level
Phosphorus
Enzyme Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
- Calcitonin
$\square$ Vit. D
- PTH

\section*{Factors enhancing bone formation cont'd}
- Growth Hormone (GH)
- Glucocorticoids (Cortisol)
- Sex hormone (Estrogen, Androgens)

\section*{Factors limiting bone formation}
- Infection and inflammation
- Activity and Weight bearing

\section*{PHYSIOLOGY OF BONE HEALING}

The process of bone healing is known as Callus Formation. Fractures and surgical interruptions of bone both heal by the same process and occurs in five major stages as follows:
- Hematoma formation
- Fibrin meshwork formation
- Invasion of oesteoblast
- Callus formation
- Remodeling

\section*{1. Hematoma formation}

Because bone is highly vascular, bleeding occurs at both ends of the fractured bone. Increased capillary permeability permits further extravasation of blood into the injured area.

Blood or periosteal sheath or adiarent ticsuand factenc the hroken ${ }^{26}$

\section*{2. Fibrin meshwork formation}

Fibroblast invade the hematoma forming a fibrin meshwork.

White blood cells wall off the area localizing the inflammation.

\section*{3.Invasion of oesteoblast}

As oesteoblasts invade the fibrous union to make it firm, blood vessels develop from capillary buds, thereby establishing a supply for nutrients to build collagen and granulation tissue is formed.

Collagen strands become longer and begin to incorporate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ deposits leading to formation of cartilage.

\section*{4. Callus formation}

Osteoblasts form a woven bony structure known as callus.

The osteoblasts continuously lay a network for the build up of bone, while osteoclasts destroy dead bone and help in the synthesis of new ones.
$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and phosphorus are deposited as mineral salts.

\title{
5. Remodeling
}

Excess callus is reabsorbed and new bone is laid down.

This is important because bone that has not undergone remodeling lacks the mechanical properties necessary for weight bearing.

\section*{Factors impeding callus formation}
1. Inadequate/poor reduction of the fracture
2. Excessive edema at the fracture site impeding the supply of nutrients to the area of injury.
3. Excessive bone loss at the time of injury, which prevents sufficient bridging of the broken ends.

\section*{Factors Impeding Callus formation Cont'd}
4. Inefficient immobilization
5. Infection at the site of injury.
6. Bone necrosis.
7. Anemia or other systemic conditions.
8. Endocrine imbalance.

\section*{FRACTURES}

A fracture is a discontinuity or break in a bone related to a blow, fall, accident, stress or disease process.

Avulsion fractures occur when a strong ligament or tendon pulls a fragment of bone away from the rest of bone.

Broken bones affect other adjacent structures.

\section*{Effects of fractures}
- Soft tissue edema
- Hemorrhage into muscles and joints
- Joint dislocation
- Ruptured tendons
- Severed nerve
- Damaged blood vessels
- Damaged body organs

\section*{Classification/Types of fractures}

Fractures can either be:
1) Complete: There is a break across the entire bone;
2) Incomplete: Breakage occur partially;
3) Closed fracture: There is breakage but the skin remains intact; OR,
4) Open fracture: Involves the skin or mucus membrane

\section*{Complete fractures}

Complete fractures can be/includes
1) Simple(Closed)
2) Compound(Open)
3) Comminuted (Involves more than two fracture fragments)
4) Linear
5) Oblique
6) Spiral
7) Transverse

\section*{Complete fracture cont'd}
8. Impacted
9. Pathological
10. Avulsion
11. Extracapsular
12. Intracapsular

\section*{Incomplete fractures}

\section*{Incomplete fractures include}
(i) Greenstick fracture
- Torus fracture: There is buckling of the cortex caused by impaction;
- Bowing fracture: The bone becomes curved along its longitudinal axis; $O R$
- A transverse fracture occurring in the cortex and extending into the midportion of the bone but then becomes oriented along the longitudinal axis of the bone withoudisrupting the opposite cortex.

\section*{Incomplete fractures cont'd}
(ii) Stress fracture: A very small crack in bone caused by unusual or repeated stress or heavy continuous weight on the ankle or leg; typically occurs in weight-bearing bones, such as the tibia and metatarsals bones and is a common sports injury, mostly associated with athletics.
(iii) Transchondral fracture: Involves entire thickness of cartilage down to subchondral

\section*{Grading of Open fractures}

Open fractures can be graded according to level/degree of contamination as follows:
(i) Grade 1: Fracture with clean wound $\approx 1 \mathrm{~cm}$ or less.
(ii) Grade 2: Has a large wound with extensive soft tissue damage.
(iii)Grade 3: The wound is contaminated and there is extensive soft tissue damage.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES OF FRACTURES}

Common clinical manifestations of fractures include:
(i) Pain (swelling, muscle spasm)
(ii) Loss of normal function
(iii) Obvious deformity
(iv) Excessive motion at the site

Crepitus - the rattling sound or vibration produced by rabing bone or irregular cartilage surfaces together.

\section*{Clinical features of fractures cont'd}
(vi) Soft tissue edema
(vii) Warmth over injured area
(viii) Ecchymosis
(ix) Impairment or loss of sensation/paralysis
(x) Signs of shock
(xi) Evidences fracture on X-ray film

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF FRACTURES}

\section*{Objectives of Fracture Management}

\section*{The major focus during the management of fractures aims at;}
1. Reducing the fracture,
2. Immobilization, and

\title{
IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT
}
1. Maintain airway and assess for shock
2. Splint the fracture
3. Preserve correct body alignment

\title{
SECONDARY MANAGEMENT Simple Fracture:
}
1. Reduction: closed reduction/manual
manipulation
2. Traction
3. Immobilization (cast, wires, screws, plates)

\section*{Compound fracture}
1. Surgical debridement
2. Wound culture
3. Wound dressing
4. Monitor infection (osteomyelitis, tetanus, gas gangrene)
5. Wound closure
- Reduce fracture
7. Immobilize truesture

\section*{Reduction}

Is the restoration of the fracture fragments to anatomic alignment and rotation.

Reduction can be achieved in two ways:
1. Closed reduction: Aligning the bone through external manipulation/traction (cast, splint or other devices).
2. Open reduction: A surgical procedure (ORIFOpenduction with internal fixation)

\section*{Disadvantages of internal fixation}
(i) Hypersensitivity to the devices; some patients may react to the internal fixator devices.
(ii) Damage to the bone and underlying tissues during the procedure.
(iii) Infections.
(iv) Bone overgrowth may occur as the bone excludes this plate.

High chances of failure rate.
(vi) It is expensme as it may need to be removed laters

\section*{Immobilization}

Immobilization is used to hold broken bones in contact to each other until healing takes place.

This can be achieved externally through external fixators such as casts, splints, braces and traction; or internally by use of metal plates and pins.

\section*{Traction}

Is a mechanism that ensures a study pull is exerted on a part of or parts of the body to maintain adequate alignment.

Traction is used to reduce and immobilize fractures, and to maintain correct alignments.

It also helps in overcoming muscle spasms, correcting deformities and stretching adhesion.

\section*{Types of traction}
1. Skin traction

The traction device is applied directly to the skin and attaching weights to them (Buck's extension and Russel traction)

Hold $2-3.5 \mathrm{Kg}$ ( 4.5 to 8 lb )
Pelvic traction-4.5-to 9 Kg (10 to 20 lb )
Monitor skin break down as a complication of traction

\section*{Skin traction}

\section*{Skeletal traction}

The traction device is applied directly to the bone.

Can hold 7-12 Kg (15-25 lb).
Potential complication include infection

\section*{Skeletal traction}

\section*{Principles of effective traction}
1. Use counter-traction to achieve effective traction.
2. Traction must be continuous.
3. Skeletal traction is never interrupted.
4. Do not remove weight until advised
5. Always position the patient at the centre of the bed to help avoid poor body alignment.
6. Ropes must be unobstructed
7. Weight must hang free and not rest on the floor.
8. Knots on the rope or footplate must not touch the pulley or the foot of the bed.

\section*{CAST}

Is a rigid external immobilizing device that is moulded to the contours of the body

Major purpose of the cast include:
(i) To immobilize an already reduced fracture.
(ii) To correct the deformity.
(iii) To stabilize weakened joints.

\section*{Casting Materials}

Fiberglass casts: Composed of water-activated polyurethane materials with the versatility of plaster but are more water resistant, lighter in weight and more durable than plaster

\section*{Plaster Casts:}

Consists of rolls of plaster of Paris impregnated bandages wet in cool water and smoothly applied to the body.

Produces a rigid dressing within 15-20 minutes, but require a 1-3 days to dry completely deponding on plaster thickness and environmenal drying conditions.

\section*{Types of cast}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_fa1e11e0fdc9e28da339g-067.jpg?height=1391&width=2116&top_left_y=389&top_left_x=192)

\section*{Types of casts}
1. Short arm cast: Extends from below the elbow joint to the palmar crease, secured around the base of the thumb.
2. Long arm cast: Extends from the axillar fold to the proximal palmar crease, with the elbow immobilized at right angles
3. Short leg cast: Extends from below the knee to the base of the toes with the foot flexed at right angles in a neutral position.

\section*{Types of Casts cont'd}
1. Long leg cast: Extends from the junction of the upper and middle $1 / 3^{\text {rd }}$ of the thigh to the base of the toes; the knees may be slightly flexed.
2. Walking cast: A short or long- leg cast reinforced for strength
3. Body cast: Encircles trunk

\section*{SOFT TISSUE INJURIES}

\title{
Soft Tissue Injuries Contusions \\ Strains \\ Sprains
}

\section*{Contusions}

A Contusion is a soft tissue injury produced by a blunt force such as a blow, a kick or even a fall.

The small blood vessels rupture and bleed into soft tissues leading to ecchymosis or a bruise.

Hematoma may develop if bleeding is pronounced.

\section*{Symptoms of Contusion include}
(i) Pain
(ii) Swelling
(iii) Joint dislocation

Management strategies include
- Intermittent application of cold compresses
- Resting the affected limb

Most contusion resolve within 1-2 weeks

\section*{Strains}

A strain is a muscle pull caused by overuse, overstretching or excessive stress on a muscle.

It is a microscopic, incomplete muscle tear, with some bleeding into the tissue.

Signs may include
(i) Isometric muscle contraction
(ii) Sudden pain with local tenderness on muscle.

\section*{Sprains}

A sprain refers to an injury to the ligaments surrounding a joint, commonly caused by a wrench or twisting.
A torn ligament loses its stabilizing ability
Common symptoms of sprain include:
- Oedema
- Tenderness which increase within 2-3 hours
- Decreased movement

An X-ray film should be taken to rule out an awlsion fracture

\section*{Management of Soft tissue Injuries}

The management of contusions, strains and sprains, can be summed up with the acronym "RICE"
$\boldsymbol{R}=\boldsymbol{R} \boldsymbol{e} \boldsymbol{s} \boldsymbol{t}$
Resting the affected limb prevent additional injury and promote healing.
$\boldsymbol{I}=\boldsymbol{I} \boldsymbol{c} \boldsymbol{e}$
Application of cold compresses produces vasoconstriction hence decreasing the edema and discomfort associated with such injuries.

C = Compression
An elastic bandage provides pressure that controls bleeding, reduces edema and also supports the underlying structures.

\section*{E = Elevation}

Elevating a limb controls swelling by increasing venous return to the central circulation.

Surgical repair is done for tone torn muscle and disrupted ligament.

\title{
JOINT DISLOCATION
}

\section*{Joint Dislocation cont'd}

Is a condition in which the articular surfaces of the bones forming a joint are no longer in anatomical approximation to each other causing pain and impaired movement at such joints.

The impairment of the approximation of bone surfaces can be total or incomplete/partial, in which case the condition is referred to as a subluxation.

\section*{Joint dislocation cont'd}

Dislocations can also be classified as:
- Congenital: present at birth
- Spontaneous or
- Traumatic

A traumatic joint dislocation constitutes an orthopedic emergency which can lead to avascular necrosis and nerve palsy if not promptly treated, because the associated joint structures are distorted and severely stretched.

\section*{Joint dislocation commonly manifests with:}
(i) Pain on the affected joint and around it.
(ii) Change in joint contour
(iii) Change in length of the extremity involvd
(iv) Loss of normal mobility
(v) Change in the axis of the dislocated bones

An X-ray film can be taken to help confirms the diagnosis

\section*{Management OI Dislocation}
1. Immobilize the affected joint/s
2. Promptly reduce the joint
3. Control pain
4. Monitor neurovascular status
5. Perform range of motion(ROM)
6. Educar on how to immobilize joint

(ii) Elderly /Old age
(iii) Obesity
(iv) Impaired immune systems

\section*{Causative organisms of Osteomyeliti}

Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for approximately 70 $80 \%$ of all bone infections.

Other causative organisms of bone infections include:
- Proteus spp.
- Pseudomonas spp.
- Escherichia coli

\section*{Osteomyelitis cont'd}

Bone infections are more difficult to eradicate than soft tissue infections.

This is because the affected bones become walled off; natural body immune responses are blocked and there is less penetration by antibiotics

Osteomyelitis may become chronic and affect quality of life.

\section*{Pathophysiology of Osteomyelitis} The initial response to infection is inflammation, increased vascularity, and edema. After 2 or 3 days, thrombosis of the blood vessels occurs in the area, resulting in ischemia with bone necrosis.

The infection extends into the medullary cavity and under the periostum and may spread into

\section*{Pathophysiology cont'd}

Unless the infective process is treated promptly, a bone abscess forms.

This abscess cavity contains dead bone tissue called a sequestrum, which does not easily liquefy and drain.

Therefore, the cavity cannot collapse and heal, as occurs in soft tissue abscesses. New bone growth, called involucrum, forms and surrounds the sequestrum.

\section*{Pathophysiology cont'd}

Although healing appears to take place, a chronically infected sequestrum remains and produces recurring abscesses throughout the patient's life causing a chronic osteomyelitis.

\section*{RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS}

\section*{Rheumatoid Arthritis}

Arthritis is an inflammation of the joint, causing pain and stiffness.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, systemic disease characterized by recurrent inflammation of the diarthrodial joints, related structures and the surrounding tissues.

\section*{Aetiology}

The exact cause of RA is not clearly understood
Theories suggesting:
(i) Infection e.g with Epstern-Barr virus, the parvoviruses and mycobacteria may trigger the process.
(ii) Auto-immunity
(iii) Genetic factors
(iv) Others: such as metabolic and biochemical abnormalities, nutritional, environmental and occupational factors.

\section*{Pathophysiology of R. Arthritis}

The disease progresses through four stages:
1. The unknown aetiologic factor initiate synovitis with swelling of the synovial membrane producing excess synovial fluid.
2. Inflammatory granular tissue called pannus is formed at the junction of the synovial membrane and cartilage.

This eventually spreads and invades the joint capsule and subchondrial bone.

\section*{Pathophysiology cont'd}
3. A tough fibrous connective tissue replaces the pannus thus occluding the joint space. This results into fibrous ankylosis causing a decrease in joint motion and increased deformity.
4. As the fibrous tissue calcifies, bony ankylosis may result in total joint immobilization.

\section*{Systemic manifestations of R. Arthritis}
-Pulmonary
- Cardiac
- Vascular
- Ophthalmological
- Dermatological
- Hematological

\section*{Clinical features of R. Arthritis}

The signs and symptoms of RA are quite non specific and insidious. These may include
1. Fatigue
2. Anorexia
3. Weight loss, fever, malaise, morning stiffness of the joints.
4. Pain during rest and movement; night pains, edematous, erythematous "boggy joints"

\section*{Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis}

The goal of therapy is to:
1. Relieve symptoms
2. Prevent joint destruction
3. Maintain joint functions

\section*{Management of RA cont'd}
- Administer drug to control pain (NSAIDS, Corticosteroids)
- Stabilize /Support the joints
- Protect a joint or body part from external trauma.
- Assist the patient to exercise specific joints
- Apply cold pacts
- Rest, excise and diet are important

\section*{Management of RA cont'd}
- Surgery may be indicated to correct the deformity, relieve pain and restore function.
- Educate the patient on balance of rest and activity, joint protection and energy conservation, proper use of medication and safety measures to prevent injury

\section*{SEPTIC ARTHRITIS}

\section*{Septic Arthritis}

In S. Arthritis, the joint become is either infected through infections from another part of the body or directly through trauma or surgical instrumentation.

Factors that may predispose to S. Arthritis include:
(i) Trauma to the joints.
(ii) Joint replacement
(iii) Coexisting arthritis
(iv) Diminished host resistance

\section*{Causative organisms of septic arthritis}

The leading causative agent is Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Streptococci and some gram negative organisms have also

Prompt recognition and treatment of infected joints are important because accumulating pus results in chondrolysis (destruction of hyaline cartilage)

\section*{Clinical Manifestations of S. Arthritis}

The patient with acute septic arthritis usually presents with:
(i) A warm, painful, swollen joint with decreased range of motion.
(ii) Chills and fever
(iii) Leukocytosis.

(i) Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics are started promptly and then changed to organismspecific antibiotics after culture results are available.
(ii) Needle aspiration (Arthrocentesis) to remove excess fluid exudate, and debris.
(iii) Immobilize the joint in a functional position

\section*{S. Arthritis Management cont'd}
(iv) Administer analgesia and anti-inflammatory agents such as NSAIDS.
(v) Ensure proper/adequate nutrition and
hydration.
(vi) Educate the patient on medication, the septic arthritis process, importance of supporting the affected joint and strategies to promote healing through aseptic dressing changes and proper wound are.

\section*{Osteoarthritis}

Also known as Degenerative Joint Disease (DJD), this is a slowly progressive disorder of articulating joints, especially in the weight bearing joints.

It is characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage and overgrowth of bone.

Damage is localized to the joints and surrounding tissues

\section*{Aetiology of OA}

May occur as Primary (Idiopathic)
Osteoarthritis or Secondary, resulting from a previous joint injury or inflammatory disease.

Risk factors to Secondary OA may include:
(i) Previous fractures.
(ii) Infections
(iii) Congenital deformities
(iv) Old age - usually seen in 50-70 years but may also occur as early as 45 years

\section*{Aetiology of OA cont'd}

Other factors influencing development of osteoarthritis include:
- Osteochondritis of head of femur esp. in children (congenital structural defects).
- Metabolic disturbances such as obesity and overweight.
- Repeated intra-articular hemorrhage
- Septic arthritis

Excessive stress on joints through occupational or recreationameated use.

\section*{Pathophysiology of OA}

The factors responsible for OA development (genetic and hormonal factors, mechanical injury, previous joint damage or any other factor) stimulates a Chondrocytic response in the affected joint.

\section*{The stimulated chondrocytes releases chemokines and cytokines.}

This leads to the Stimulation, production, and release of proteolytic enzymes, metalloproverses collagenases.

\section*{Pathophysiology of OA cont'd}

The resulting damage caused by the proteolytic enzymes and metalloproteases, further predisposes to more chondrocyte response leading to further damage.

With degeneration over time, bones become yellow and opaque with rough surfaces and areas of malacia (softening).

New bone outgrowth are formed at the joint margins and at the attachment sites of ligament.

\section*{Clinical manifestation of OA}
(i) Joint enlargement and Crepitus
(ii) Pain which increases with weight bearing
(iii) Limited joint motion
(iv) Morning stiffness (less than one hour)
(v) Non-inflammatory effusion

\section*{Management of OA}

There is no specific management but therapy is aimed at symptomatic relief and control of pain.

Encourage appropriate nutritional intake to maintain ideal weight.

Behavioural change especially with occupation and exercises.

Surgical Intervention may be indicated.

\section*{GOUT}

Gout is a heterogeneous group of conditions related to a defect of purine metabolism resulting in hyperuricemia (a uric acid serum concentration ${ }^{>} 7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ [ $0.4 \mathrm{fmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ]).

Oversecretion of uric acid or a renal defect resulting in decreased excretion of uric acid, or a combination of both, occurs.

The incidence increases with age and body mass index and it tends to occur more commone in males than females.

\section*{Gout cont'd}

Is the principal manifestation of sustained hyperuricaemia.

Men are ten times more likely to have gout than women (At puberty male uric level rise and remain higher than those of females until menopause when female uric level rise)

Serum uric acid are related to Age, sex and genetic constitution.

\section*{Gout Classification}

\section*{Gout can be classified as Primary or Secondary.}

In Primary hyperuricemia, elevated serum urate levels or manifestations of urate deposition are due to faulty uric acid metabolism.

Primary hyperuricemia may be due to severe dieting or starvation, excessive intake of foods that are high in purines (shellfish, organ meats), or nexedity.

\section*{Classification of Gout cont'd}

In Secondary hyperuricemia, gout is a clinical feature secondary to any of a number of genetic or acquired processes.

Such processes may include conditions in which there is an increase in cell turnover such as leukemia, multiple myeloma, some types of anemias, psoriasis and even an increase in cell breakdown.

\section*{Gout cont'd}

About $60 \%$ of uric acid is replaced daily and approximately $75 \%$ of uric acid is excreted in the kidney and remainder lost in the gut.

Uric acid is filtered at glomerulus and $90 \%$ is then reabsorbed

\section*{Causes of hyperuricemia}
- Prolonged use of diuretic drugs are the main cause but clinical gout is unknown
- Renal failure
- Increased production of uric acid: polycthaemia, hemolytic anemia, severe psoriasis and carcinomatosis.
- Decreased renal excretion of uric acid-chronic renal disease, drug administration, reduction in fractional urate clearance

\section*{Causes of hyperuriceamia cont'd}

The patient with Gout is usually obese, and drinks more alcohol. Dietary purines have a modest effect on plasma uric level

Short term alteration in diet such as starvation and ingestion of large amount of alcohol may cause hyperuricaemia by reducing renal clearance of uric acid due to increased lactic acid production which competes with uric acid excretion in the kidneys

\title{
Pathophysiology of Gout
}

Prolonged hyperuricemia leads to crystal formation, which may accumulate in synovium and at external sites.

When crystal are phagocytosed there is interaction between the crystals and lysosomal membrane due to weak acid groups and membrane disruption follows.

Phagocytosis of urate leads to increased production of lactic acid which causes further precipitation of crystals.

\section*{Clinical features of Gout}
- Patient is obese
- Pain usually early morning affecting the big toe.
- Affected joints are usually red, swollen and warm

\section*{Precipitating factors of Gout}
- Joint trauma
- Unusually physical exercise
- Alcohol
- High protein diet/starvation
- Surgery
- Drugs
- Severe incidental illness

\section*{Diagnosis of Gout}
- History
- X-ray
- Serum uric level measurements

\section*{Management of Gout}

The goal of treatment is to:
(i) Reduce acute synovitis
(ii) Prevent further crystallization
(iii) Identify associated disease

Acute synovitis can be managed by NSAIDs and even Colchicine.

\section*{Management of Gout cont'd}

Prevention of crystallization through:
- Weight reduction, especially among obese and overweight individuals
- Reduction of alcohol consumption
- Evaluate need for diuretic drugs

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS}

Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by a reduction in bone density and change in bone structure.

In this case the rate of bone resorption is greater than that of bone formation resulting in reduced total bone mass, hence increasing susceptibility to fractures.

Bones are porous, brittle and fragile i.e. fractures easily under stress that would not break a normal bone.

Commonly results in compressed fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine ${ }_{164}$ and intertrocnameric regions of femur.

\section*{Predisposing Osteoporosis}

\section*{factors}

Normal bone remodeling increases bone mass until early 30s.

Gender, race, genetics, aging, low body weight and body mass index, nutrition, lifestyle and physical activity influence peak bone mass and development of osteoporosis.

Osteoporosis is not a disease of the elderly but fractures occur with aging, onset occur in eas life when bone mass peak begins to decline

\section*{Pathophysiology of Osteoporosis}

After peak bone mass is achieved, Calcitonin ,which inhibits bone resorption and promotes bone formation is decreased.

Estrogen which inhibits bone breakdown decreases with aging

Parathyroid hormone increases with aging increasing bone turnover and resorption resulting to loss of bone mass

Women develop osteoporosis more than men because of lower bone peak mass and the effectof estrogen loss during menopause

\section*{Factors affecting bone mass}
- Genetics
- Nutrition
- Age
- Physical exercise
- Lifestyle choices
- Medication

\section*{Risk Factors}
- Small framed non-obese individuals
- Race
- Sex
- Nutritional factors
- Lifestyle

\title{
Diagnosis
}
- X-Ray

Laboratory studies (calcium, serum
phosphate)

\section*{Management of Osteoporosis}
(i) Adequate nutrition rich in calcium and vitamin D throughout life, with an increased calcium intake during adolescence, young adulthood, and the middle years, protects against skeletal demineralization.
(ii) Calcium supplementation e.g., Caltrate ${ }^{\circledR}$, Citrocal® may be prescribed and taken with meals or with a beverage high in Vit. $\boldsymbol{C}$ to promote absorption.
(iii) Regular weight bearing exercises to promotes bone formation.

\section*{Management of Osteoporosis cont'd}
(iv)Hormonal Replacement Therapy (HRT) with estrogen and progesterone, especially at natural or surgical menopause.
(v)Calcitonin to suppress bone loss.
(vi)If the patient has a fracture, manage appropriately depending on the condition.

\section*{Prevention of Osteoporosis}

\section*{Osteomalacia}

\section*{Is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by inadequate mineralization of bone.}

Faulty mineralization leads to softening and weakening of the skeleton.

\section*{Pathophysiology Osteomalacia}

\section*{of}

Deficiency of Vitamin D (calcitriol) which promotes calcium absorption from GI leads to low calcium and phosphate movement to calcification.

Osteo-malacia may result from failed calcium absorption (malabsorption syndrome) or from excessive loss of calcium from the body.

GI disorders -fats are inadequately absorbed are likely to produce osteo-malacia through loss of calcium and Vit D, the first being excreted in feces.

\section*{Pathophysiology cont'd}

Liver and kidney diseases can produce lack of Vit D because these are organs that convert Vit D to its active form.

The malnutrition type of Osteomalacia is as a result of poverty

\section*{Clinical manifestations Osteomalacia}

\section*{of}
- Softening and weakening of the skeleton.
- Pain and tenderness to touch.
- Bowing of the bones
- Pathologic fracture
- On exam-skeletal deformity (spinal kyphosis and bowed leg)
- Limping gait

\section*{Diagnosis}

Osteomalacia
(i) History of the presenting disorder.
(ii) X-ray film reveals a generalized demineralization of bone.
(iii) Serology reveals a low serum calcium and phosphorous level with a moderately elevated concentration of alkaline phosphatase.
(iv) Urinalysis excretion of calcium and creatinine is low.
(v) Bone biopsy reveals an increase in osteoid levels.

\section*{Management of Osteomalacia}
(i) Correct the underlying cause/disorder.
(ii) Increase dose of Vit D with supplement calcium, if the disorder is due to malabsorption. (High doses of Vit. D are toxic hence adequate monitoring is very necessary).
(iii) Sunlight exposure to promote Vit. D utilization.

\section*{Management of Osteomalacia cont'd}
(i) Provide adequate diet/nutrition.
(ii) Use physical, psychological and
pharmaceutical measures.
(iii) Long term monitoring of patient progress is required.

BONE TUMOURS

\section*{Bone tumors}

Neoplasm of the musculoskeletal system are of various types.

\section*{They may be primary tumors or metastatic from primary cancers .}

Metastatic bone tumours are more common than primary bone tumours.

\section*{Benign Bone tumours}

Benign bone tumours are more common than malignant primary bone tumours.

They are slow growing, well circumscribed, present few symptoms and are not a cause of death.

\section*{Types of Benign Bone}

\section*{tumours}
(i) Osteochondroma: Is the most common, develops during growth and becomes static. It may become malignant in rare cases, especially, after trauma.
(ii) Enchondroma: A tumour of hyaline cartilage commonly affecting the hand, femur, tibia and humerus.

Presents with mild ache and pathologic freture may occur.

\section*{Benign Tumours cont.}
(iii) Bone cysts
- Osteoid osteoma: A painful tumour that occur in children and young adults.
- Giant Cell Osteoclastoma: Remain benign for a long period but may undergo malignancy transformation, invade and local tissues.
Are soft, hemorrhagic and common in young adults.

\section*{Malignant Bone tumours}

Are quite rare and usually arise from connective and supportive tissue cells (sarcomas) or bone marrow elements such as multiple myeloma.

An example is Osteosarcoma: (Osteogenic sarcoma) the most common and often a fatal primary malignant bone tumour.

Prognosis depend on whether it has spread to other organs such as the lungs, liver etc (Bone tumor metastasis to the lungs is common).

Appears mostly in males (10-25 yrs), older people with Paet's disease, and may also occur followigg radiation expe

\section*{Clinical manifestations of Bone tumors}

Commonly affects the distal femur, proximal tibia and proximal humerus, presenting with:
(i) Pain
(ii) Swelling
(iii) Limited motion
(iv) Weight loss
(v) Paipule bony mass

\title{
Malignant tumour types
}
(i) Chondrosarcoma - Common among adults.
(ii) Ewing's sarcoma.
(iii) Fibrosarcoma.
(iv) Liposarcoma

\section*{Nursing care of a patient with bone tumour}
(i) Pain management.
(ii) Evaluation of activities of daily living (ADL).
(iii) Prevention of pathological fracture.
(iv) Promote coping skill.
(v) Promote self esteem.
(vi) Promote understanding of disease process

\section*{AMPUTATION}

\section*{Amputation}

Amputation is one of the oldest surgical procedures with artificial limbs identified from over 2000 years ago.

It refers to the removal of the whole or part of an arm/hand or a leg/foot.

Amputations can occur after an injury (traumatic amputation) or deliberately at surgery.

In vascular surgery amputations are only rarely performed on the arms. Vascular surgeons frequently have to perform amputations of toes or legs.

\section*{Causes of Amputation}
(i) Peripheral vascular disease.
(ii) Gas gangrene.
(iii) Trauma.
(iv) Congenital deformities.
(v) Malignant osteomyelitis/tumour.

\section*{Amputations cont'd}

A majority of amputations are performed because the arteries of the limbs have been blocked following insufficient blood supply to the limb.

About $30-40 \%$ of amputations are performed in patients with diabetes, because diabetes can cause hardening of the arteries. Patients with DM can develop foot/toe ulceration and about 7\% of patients will have an active ulcer or a healed ulcer.

Ulcers are recurrent in many patients and approximately $5-15 \%$ of diabetic patients with ulcerswill ultimately require an amputation.

\section*{Types of amputations}

Amputations can be divided into minor and major.

Minor amputations are amputations where only a toe or part of the foot is removed. A ray amputation is a particular form of minor amputation where a toe and part of the corresponding metatarsal bone is removed.

A forefoot amputation can sometimes be helpful in patients with more than one toe invelved by gangrene.

\section*{Below knee amputation}

This operation can be performed using 2 major techniques. The most common technique is the Posterior Myoplastic flap (Burgess) technique where the skin and muscle from the calf are brought forward to cover the shin bones after they have been divided.

The other main technique is the Skew flap (Kingsley Robinson) technique in which the muscles of the calf are brought forward in the same way as in the posterior technique but the skin flaps are skewed in relation to the muscle.

Below knee amputation incision

\section*{Above knee amputation}

In this procedure the bone in the thigh (femur) is divided about 12-15 cm above the knee joint and the muscle and skin closed over the end of the bone.

\section*{Amputation related Complications}
(i) Hemorrhage
(ii) Infections
(iii) Skin breakdown
(iv) Phantom limb pain
(v) Joint contractures

\section*{Assignment}

\section*{Read and make notes on the following}
(i) Care of the stump.
(ii) Nursing care of patient undergoing amputation.

\section*{LOW BACK PAIN}

\section*{Low Back Pains}

Low back pains constitutes one of the most common reasons for seeking medical attention.

Approximately ${ }^{>} 84 \%$ of adults will have low back pain at some point. Some suffer from chronic or recurrent courses, with substantial impact on quality of life

Most episodes of low back pains are self-limiting

Treatment comprises a wide variety of approaches and no specific approach would be suggested as the most optimuns.

\section*{Low Back Pains cont'd}

Any structure in the back can cause pain, including ligaments, joints, periosteum, musculature, blood vessels, annulus fibrosus and nerves. Intervertebral discs and facet joints being the most commonly affected.
$85 \%$ of those with isolated low back pains do not have a clear localization. There is no clear histopathology or anatomical location, and is commonly referred to as "strain" or "sprain".

Age of onset is usually above 35 yrs old with men and womang affected equally almost at the same rate.

\section*{Low Back Pains cont'd}

Low back pains is the leading and expensive cause of work disability in those < 45 years

Risk factors Include:
(i) Heavy lifting
(ii) Twisting and vibration exercises
(iii) Obesity.
(iv) Poor conditioning.

\section*{Diagnosis of Low Back Pain}
1. History

Any evidence of systemic disease?
${ }^{\circ}$ Age (especially >50),
- History of cancer, unexplained weight loss, chronic infection.
- Duration of illness
${ }^{\circ}$ Presence of nocturnal pain
- Response to therapy
- Many patients with infection or malignancy will not have relief when lying down
For arthritis patients - young age, nocturnal pain and worsening with rest are common

\section*{Diagnosis of Low Back Pain cont'd}

Any evidence of neurologic compromise e.g.
(i) Cauda equina syndrome: a medical emergency usually due to a tumor or massive herniation compressing nerves at the cauda equina. Urinary retention with overflow, saddle anesthesia, bilateral sciatica, leg weakness, fecal incontinence.
(ii) Sciatica: a nerve root irritation characterised by sharp/burning pain down the posterior or lateral leg to foot or ankle; can be associated with numbness/tingling. If due to disc herniation often worsens with cough, sneeze or performing the Valsalva.

\section*{Diagnosis of Low Back Pain cont'd}

Any evidence of neurologic compromise e.g:
(iii) Spinal stenosis: Caused by narrowing of the spinal canal, nerve root canals, or intervertebral foramina.

Most commonly due to bony hypertrophic changes in facet joints and thickening of the ligamentum flavum.

Disc bulging or spondylolisthesis may also cause back pain. Transient leg tingling, pain in calf and lower extremity that is triggered by ambulation and improved with rest, are common symptoms..

Can be differentiated from vascular claudication through detection of normal arterial pulses on exam.

\section*{Diagnosis of Low Back Pain cont'd}

\section*{2. Physical Examination}

Inspection of back and posture (ie. Scoliosis, kyphosis)
- Range of motion
- Palpation of the spine (vertebral tenderness sensitive for infection)
- If high suspicion of malignancy, do a breast/prostate/lymph node exam
- Peripheral pulses to distinguish from vascular claudication

\section*{Physical Examination}

Straight leg raise: for those with sciatica or spinal stenosis symptoms
- Patient supine, examiner holds patient's leg straight
- Elevation of less than 60 degrees abnormal and suggests compression or irritation of nerve roots
- Reproduces sciatica symptoms (NOT just hamstring)
- Ipsilateral straight leg raise sensitive but not specific for herniated disk
- Crossed straight leg raise (symptoms of sciatica reproduced when opposite leg is raised) insensitive but highly specific

\section*{Physical examination}
- Neurologic examination
- L5: ankle and great toe dorsiflexion
-S1: plantar flexion, ankle reflex
- Dermatomal sensory loss
- L5: numbness medial foot and web space between $1^{\text {st }}$ and $2^{\text {nd }}$ toes
-S1: lateral foot/ankle

\section*{Imaging}
- AP and lateral L-spine if no clinical improvement after 4-6 weeks
"Clinicians should not routinely obtain imaging or other diagnostic tests in patients with nonspecific low back pain" (American College of Physicians and American Pain Society).
- Do perform x-rays if: fever, unexplained weight loss, hx of cancer, neurologic deficits, EtOH, age $<18$ or >50, trauma, immunosuppression, probaged steroid use, skin/urinary infection, indwelling theter

\section*{Imaging}
- CT and MRI
- More sensitive for detection of infection and cancer than plain films
- Also able to image herniated discs and spinal stenosis, which cannot be appreciated on plain films
- Beware: herniated/bulging discs often found in asymptomatic volunteers $\square$ may lead to overdiagnosis/overtreatment
- MRI better than CT for detection of infection, metastases, rare neural tumours
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_fa1e11e0fdc9e28da339g-212.jpg?height=1835&width=2259&top_left_y=20&top_left_x=127)

\section*{Natural History}
- Most recover rapidly
- $90 \%$ of patients seen within 3 days of symptom onset recovered within 2 weeks
- Recurrences are common
- Most have chronic disease with intermittent exacerbations
- Spinal stenosis is the exception $\square$ usually gets progressively worse with time

\section*{Management of Low Back Pain}
- Non-specific low back pain
- Regular NSAIDs and muscle relaxants good for symptomatic relief.
- Spinal manipulation of limited utility in studies
- Should recommend rapid return to normal activities with neither bed rest nor exercise in the acute period
- Bed rest found to not improve and may delay recovery
- Exercises not useful in acute phase; use in chronic

\section*{Therapy}
- Nonspecific low back pain
- Traction, facet joint injections have minimal effects.
- Systematic reviews of acupunture have shown little benefit
- ? Massage therapy have some promising results
- Surgery only effective for sciatica, spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis

\section*{Therapy}
- Herniated intervertebral discs
- Nonsurgical treatment for at least a month
- Exceptions: cauda equina syndrome, progressive neurologic deficits
- Early treatment same as for nonspecific low back pain, but may need short courses of narcotics for pain control
- Bed rest not useful
-Some patients benefit from epidural corticosteroid injections
- If severe pain, neurologic defecits consider MRI and surgery.

\section*{Therapy}
- Spinal stenosis
- Physiotherapy to reduce risk of falls
- Analgesics, NSAIDs, epidural corticosteroids
- Decompressive laminecotomy
- Spinal fusion with decompression if there is additional spondylolisthesis
- Symptoms often recur, even after successful surgery

\section*{Therapy}
- Chronic low back pain
- Intensive exercise improves function and reduces pain, but is difficult to adhere to
- Anti-depressants: many with chronic low back pain are also depressed
- ? Maybe for those without depression (tricyclics)
- Opiates
- Small RCT showed better effect on pain and mood than NSAIDs
- No improvement in activity
- Significant side effects: drowsiness, constipation, nausea

\section*{Therapy}
- Chronic low back pain
- Referral to multidisciplinary pain center
$\square$ Cognitive-behavioural therapy, education, exercise, selective nerve blocks
${ }^{\circ}$ Surgical procedures rarely helpful

\section*{SPONDYLOARTHRITIS}

- Remember - can sometimes have peripheral arthritis without spinal symptoms!
- Seronegative Spondyloarthritis
- Absence of Rheumatoid Factor
- Psoriatic Arthritis
- Ankylosing Spondylitis
- Reactive Arthritis
- Enteropathic Arthritis
- Undifferentiated Spondyloarthropathy

\section*{Sacroiliitis}
- Usually bilateral and symmetric
- Initially involves the synovial-lined lower 2/3 of the Sacro-iliac joint.
- Early changes involves erosion on the iliac side of SI joint , the cartilage becomes thinner, and can cause "pseudowidening" of SI joint.

\section*{Spinal Involvement}
- Gradual ossification of the outer layers of the annulus fibrosis (Sharpey's fibers) form interverterbral bony bridges called syndesmophytes.
- Fusion of the apophyseal joints and calcification of the spinal ligaments along with bilateral syndesmophyte formation can result in "bamboo spine"

\section*{Enthesitis}
- Enthesis: site of insertion of ligament, tendon or articular capsule into bone.
- Enthesitis: Is the inflammation of enthesis resulting in new bone formation or fibrosis.
- Common sites: SI joints, intervertebral discs, manubriosternal joints, symphysis pubis, iliac crests, trochanters, patellae, clavicles, calcanei (Achille's or plantar fasciitis)

\section*{Treatment of Enthesitis}

\section*{1. NSAIDs}
- Good for mild symptoms
- Potentially disease modifying
- Indomethacin seems to work the best
- Beware of side effects, especially gastrointestinal disease

\section*{Treatment of Enthesitis}
2. Disease - Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs).
- Sulfasalazine $1000-2000 \mathrm{mg}$ bid

Seems to be the most effective for spinal symptoms.
- Methotrexate $15-25 \mathrm{mg}$ weekly
- For patients with prominent peripheral arthritis
- Doesn't work very well for spinal symptoms

\section*{Treatment}

\section*{3. Steroids}
- Not very effective at all in AS
- Local injections for enthesitis or peripheral arthritis
4. Anti-TNFa agents
- Remicade (infliximab), Enbrel (etanercept) and Humira (adalimumab)
- Very useful for treating symptoms, improving ROM, improving fatigue
-Hopefully disease-modifying . . .

\section*{MUSCULOSKELETAL DEFORMITIES}

\section*{Musculoskeletal deformities}

\section*{1.Congenital dislocation of the hip}
- Unilateral or bilateral hip dislocation can be diagnosed soon after.
- If the diagnosis is missed the child will develop shortening and external rotation of the affected limb.

\section*{TRAUMA AND INJURIES}

To include:
- Fractures
- polytrauma
- Nerve injuries
- vascular injuries
- Soft tissue injuries
- sport injuries
- Amputation

MULTIPLE(POLYTRAUMA )

\section*{Multiple(polytrauma)}
- polytrauma(Multiple trauma) is caused by a single catastrophic event that causes life-threatening injuries to at least two distinct organs or organ systems.
- Patients with single-system trauma still receive
full assessment, because even single-system injuries can be lifethreatening or more severe than they initially appear.
- Mortality in patients with multiple trauma is related to the severity of the injuries and the number of systems and organs involved.
- Immediately after injury, the body is hypermetabolic, hypercoagulable, and severely stressed.
- Care of the patient with multiple injuries requires a team approach, with one person responsible for coordinating the treatment.
- The nursing staff assumes responsibility of:
$\checkmark$ assessing and monitoring the patient, ensuring airway and IV `access,
$\checkmark$ administering prescribed medications,
$\checkmark$ collecting laboratory specimens, and
$\checkmark$ documenting activities and the patient's subsequent responses.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}
- Evidence of trauma may be sparse or absent.
- Patients with multiple trauma should be assumed to have a spinal cord injury until it is proven otherwise.
- The injury regarded as the least significant in appearance may be the most lethal.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}
- For example, the pelvic fracture not identified until an x-ray is obtained may cause rapid and massive hemorrhage into the pelvic cavity, but an obvious amputation of the arm may have already stopped bleeding from the body's normal response of vasoconstriction.

\section*{Assessment and Diagnostic Findings}

The patient is observed for the following:

Hypovolemic shock
resulting from extravasation of blood and plasma into injured tissues after compression has been released
- Paralysis of a body part

\section*{Cont.......}
-Erythema and blistering of skin
- Damaged body part (usually an extremity) appearing swollen, tense, and hard
- Renal dysfunction (prolonged hypotension causes kidney damage and acute renal insufficiency; myoglobinuria secondary to muscle damage can cause acute tubular necrosis and acute renal failure)

\section*{Management}
- The goals of treatment are to determine the extent of injuries and to establish priorities of treatment.
- Any injury interfering with a vital physiologic function (e.g., ABC)
- Airway,
- Breathing,
- Circulation) is an immediate threat to life and has the highest priority for immediate treatment.

\section*{Management}
- Essential life-saving procedures are performed simultaneously by the emergency team.
- As soon as the patient is resuscitated, clothes are removed or cut off and a rapid physical assessment is performed.
- Transfer from field management to the ED must be orderly and controlled, with attention given to the verbal report from emergency medical services.
- Treatment in a trauma center is appropriate for patients experiencing major trauma.

\section*{Management}

In conjunction with maintaining the $\mathbf{A}$ $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{C}$, the patient is observed for:
$\square$ acute renal insufficiency - Injury to the back can cause kidney damage.
$\square_{\text {severe muscular damage - may cause }}$ rhabdomyolysis, which signifies a release of myoglobin from ischemic skeletal muscle, resulting in acute tubular necrosis.
$\square$ major soft tissue injuries are splinted promptly to control bleeding and pain.
$\square$ Medications for pain and anxiety are then administered
$\square$ Patient is quickly transported
to the operating suite for wound débridement and fracture repair.
$\square$ A hyperbaric oxygen chamber (if available) may be used to hyperoxygenate crushed tissue
$\square$ The serum lactic acid level is monitored; a decrease to less than $\mathbf{2 . 5 ~ m m o l} / \mathrm{L}$ is an indication of successful resuscitation
$\square$ Injured extremity is elevated to relieve swelling and pressure.
$\square$ Fasciotomy (ie, surgical incision to the level of the fascia) to restore neurovascular function done if compartment syndrome develops

\section*{3. NERVE INJURIES AND VASCULAR INJURIES}

\section*{Introduction}
- Assessment of neurovascular status is essential for the early recognition of neurovascular deterioration or compromise.
- Delays in recognising neurovascular compromise can lead to permanent deficits, loss of a limb and even death.
- Neurovascular deterioration can occur late after trauma, surgery or cast application.

\section*{causes of nerve injuries and vascular injuries}
- Musculoskeletal trauma to the extremities
- Fracture
- Crush injury
- Post-operative
- Internal or external fixation or fractures
- Orthopaedic surgery
- Spinal surgery
- Plastic surgery on extremities or phalanges
- Cardiac catheterisation
- Tourniquet applied for long periods

\section*{causes of nerve injuries and vascular injuries}
- Application of plaster cast
- Restrictive dressing
- Application of traction (skin and skeletal)
- Burns patients
- Circumferential burns
- Signs of infection in the limb

\section*{Aim Assessment of neurovascular status}
- The aim of this clinical practice guideline is to outline the required neurovascular assessment to recognise early compromise and prevent permanent damage to the limb(s).

\section*{Definition of Terms}
- Muscle compartment: A welldefined space in the body that consists of a group of muscles in a particular segment, the muscle compartment is bound by fascia
- Fasciotomy:
*Surgical incision made through the fascia and into a compartment due to increasing pressure.
*The aim of the procedure is to release pressure to improve peripheral neurovascular status and prevent long term complications.
-Compartment
syndrome: Increase in pressure of a closed muscle compartment that causes muscle and nerve ischemia.
-Active movement: Ability to voluntarily extend and flex an extremity or digit.
-Passive movement: Assessor able to extend and

\section*{Neurovascular assessment}
- A neurovascular assessment is required for each affected limb and includes assessment of
- Pain
- Sensation
- Motor function
- Perfusion (colour, temperature, capillary refill, swelling, pulses)

\section*{Management}
- Ensure affected limb is elevated to minimise the risk of compartment syndrome.
- Lower extremities can be elevated with pillows or using bed mechanics;
- upper extremities can be elevated on either a pillow, sling or box sling.

\section*{Management of Neurovascular Compromise}
- Management include:
- Elevate limb, no higher than heart level.
- Split plaster, casts or cut/remove bandage.
- Maintain limb alignment.
- Notify surgeon and treating team.
- If neurovascular status improves keep affected limb elevated and continue to monitor closely.
- If neurovascular status does not improve or continues to deteriorate, the patient may need to go to theatre for pressure monitoring and fasciotomy.

\section*{Frequency of observations}
-1 hourly for the first 24 hours post injury, surgery or application of cast.
-Then 4 hourly for a further 48 hours or as specified by the treating medical team.
-More frequently if any deviations from baseline observations.

\section*{Neurovascular complications}
- If neurovascular status is compromised, patients may report
$\checkmark$ decreased sensation,
$\checkmark$ loss of sensation,
$\checkmark$ dysesthesia,
$\checkmark$ numbness,
$\checkmark$ tingling or pins and needles.
$\checkmark$ Altered sensation may be a result of a nerve block

\section*{4. SOFT TISSUE INJURIES}

\section*{SOFT TISSUE INJURIES}

DCaused by the following
- Contusion - bruising Injury caused by blunt force
- Strain - Microscopic tear in the muscle caused by excessive Pull or stretching
- Sprain - Injury from excessive stretching of a ligament surrounding a joint

\section*{SOFT TISSUE INJURIES}

\section*{Contusion}
- Injury caused by blunt force, such as a blow, kick, or fall.
- Many small blood vessels rupture and bleed into soft tissues (ecchymosis, or bruising). A hematoma may develop.
- Local symptoms (pain, swelling, and discoloration) are controlled with intermittent application of cold.
- Most resolve in 1 to 2 weeks.

\section*{A strain}

Microscopic tear in the muscle-Pulled muscle
A "muscle pull" caused by overuse, overstretching, or excessive stress.

Strains are microscopic, incomplete muscle tears with some bleeding into the tissue.
- The patient experiences soreness or sudden pain, with local tenderness on muscle use and isometric contraction.

\section*{A sprain}

Ligament injury (Excessive stretching of a ligament)
- Injury to the ligaments surrounding a joint caused by:
- wrenching - twisting suddenly and violently or pulling
- A torn ligament loses its stabilizing ability.
- Blood vessels rupture and edema occurs; the joint is tender, and movement of the joint becomes painful.

\section*{Cont'd...}
- The degree of disability and pain increases during the first 2 to 3 hours after the injury because of the associated swelling and bleeding.
- An x-ray should be obtained to rule out bone injury.
- Avulsion fracture (in which a bone fragment is pulled away by a ligament or tendon) may be associated with a sprain.

\section*{Sprain grading}
${ }^{\circ}$ Grade I-mild bleeding and inflammation
${ }^{\circ}$ Grade II-severe stretching and some tearing and inflammation and hematoma
${ }^{\circ}$ Grade III-complete tearing of ligament
- Grade IV-bony attachment of ligament broken away

\section*{Sprains}
- Treatment of sprains: -first-degree: rest, ice for 24 to 48 hr , compression bandage, and elevation -second-degree: immobilization, partial weight bearing as tear heals
-third-degree and $4^{\text {th }}$ degree: immobilization for 4 to 6 weeks, possible surgery

\section*{Soft Tissue Injury Step-By-Step Trauma Mngt}

AIM: To decrease swelling and pain, and encourage rest
$\square$ Treatment of contusions, strains, and sprains consists of the acronym RICE-Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation)
* R = Stop the activity immediately.

Splint to support extremities and limit movement
*l=Apply ice to the injured part
for 10 to 15 minutes for first 48 hours. Let the area warm completely before applying ice again to prevent frost

\section*{Soft Tissue Injury Step-By-Step Trauma Mngt}
* C=Wrap the injured part in a elastic compression bandage/Compression dressing
※E=Elevate the injured part to increase venous return and reduce swelling.
$\square$ NSAIDs
$\square$ See a physician for a proper diagnosis of any serious injury.

\section*{Management}
-Rest prevents additional injury and promotes healing.
-Moist or dry cold compression applied intermittently for 20-30 minutes during the first 24 to 48 hours after injury produces vasoconstriction, which decreases bleeding, edema, and discomfort.
- Care must be taken to avoid skin and tissue damage from excessive cold.

\section*{Sports-Related Injuries}
- Sport activities are very common, and, unfortunately, sports related injuries are also common consequences.

\section*{Different Types of Sports Injuries}
$\square$ These injuries may be classified as acute or chronic.
$\checkmark$ Acute injuries are those injuries that occur suddenly.
$\checkmark$ Chronic injuries happen over time and are also commonly called overuse injuries.

\section*{Different Types of Sports Injuries}
- It is important to have knowledge of first aid procedures.
$\square$ first aid supplies include
- Ice packs,
- Bandages,
- A finger splint,
- Hand sanitizer
- Alcohol wipes

\section*{First Aid for Acute Sports Injuries}
$\square$ The most common acute sportsrelated injuries vary by age.
$\square$ younger athletes are at higher risk for
$\checkmark$ fractures and
$\checkmark$ dislocations.
$\checkmark$ Concussions - traumatic brain injury due blow
*For who participate in contact sports such as football, rugby, ice hockey, and wrestling (for males) and soccer and basketball (for females)

\section*{common acute sports injuries include:}
- Dislocations
- Fractures
- Knee injuries
- Rotator cuff injuries
- Sprains and strains

\section*{Common symptoms of acute injuries include}
- Bone or joint that is visibly out of place- fxture
- cuts and abrasions
- Extreme leg or arm weakness
- Joint weakness or inability to move a joint
- Not being able to place weight on a leg, knee, ankle, or foot
- Sudden pain and swelling

\section*{Management}

\section*{Non- Invasive procedures}

Many Sport-related problems can be successfully treated without surgery, as surgery is rarely the first line of treatment for most patients.

\section*{PRICE Therapy}

If your injury does not require medical treatment, for example a mild sprain or other minor muscle or ligament damage, you can treat it at home using PRICE therapy. PRICE stands for:
-Protect the injured area from further injury,for example ,by using a support ,or in the case of an ankle injury ,wearing shoes that enclose and support your feet ,such as lace ups.

\section*{Management}
-Rest: avoid regular exercise and reduce daily physical activity.
Using crutches or a walking stick may help if you are unable to put weight on your ankle or knee.
-Ice: apply an ice pack to the affected area for 10 to 30 minutes. Do not allow the ice to touch your skin directly as this may cause a cold burn. Before applying ice, wrap it in a wet towel or put a wet towel over the injured area.

\section*{Management}
-Compression: apply pressure (compression) using elastic compression bandages. This may help to limit swelling.
-Elevation: keep the injured leg, knee, arm, elbow or wrist raised above the level of the heart as this may also help reduce swelling.

After 48 hours of PRICE therapy, stop compression and try moving the injured area.

If, after this time, your symptoms are worse, get advice from a healthcare professional.

\section*{wet towel put over the injured area.}

\section*{Management}
- Viscosupplementation: A fluid naturally occurring in human joints that coats and lubricates the joint .
- Hyaluronate (acts as a lubricant) is injected into the joint easing the pain of moderate to severe degenerative arthritis

\section*{Steroid Injections:}
- Non-surgical pain management and critical to successful long-term management of recurrent back and joint pain.
- These injections offer immediate relief for severe pain.
Ultrasound Guided Hip Injections: For the athlete that develops hip pain from running or overuse to the arthritic hip,

\section*{Steroid Injections:}

\section*{Physical Therapy}
- The goal of physical therapy treatments is to help patients return to complete independence as soon as possible.
- Physicians concentrate on prescribing physical therapy exercises.
- These exercises enable patients to resume regular movement and control inflammation
- Massage using the hands to apply pressure to the affected area encourage blood to flow to the site of the injury to help the healing process

\section*{Physical Therapy}

\section*{Physical Therapy}
- Motivate pt to return to their previous level of activity.
- Compliance with restriction of activities
- gradual resumption of activities need to be reinforced.
- Injured athletes are at risk for re injury and require follow-up and monitoring.
- Diminish level and intensity of activity to a comfortable level.
- Gradual increase of activities to acclimate the muscles, tendons, and joints to the sport motions will assist in recovery and rehabilitation.

Prevention Sports-related injuries
- using proper equipment (eg, running shoes for joggers, wrist guards for skaters) and
-effectively training and conditioning the body.
$>$ Specific training needs to be tailored to the person and the sport.

6. AMPUTATION

\section*{Definition}
- Amputation is the removal of limb, part or total from the body.
- Disarticulation is removing the limb through a joint
- Generally the amputation of Lower Limb are more common than those of upper limb.

\section*{Indications of Amputation}
- Trauma - RTA,
- Gun shot
- Malignant tumors
- Nerve injuries \& infection
- Extreme heat \& cold - burn, gangrene
- Peripheral vascular insufficiency
- Congenital absence of limbs or malformation
- Severe infection

\section*{Cont.....}
- Of all these causes, peripheral vascular disease accounts for most amputations of lower extremities
- Amputation of an upper extremity occurs less frequently than a lower extremity and is most often necessary because of either traumatic injury or a malignant tumor.

\section*{Principle consideration to amputate}
- Preservation of life - to save life
- Improvement of general health-improve the patient's quality of life.
- Restoration of function or to improve function
- Reduction of pain and other symptoms

\section*{Causes of Amputation}
$\square$ Natural causes e.g. Congenital absence, Arterial disease, Frostbite, Wound infections, Diabetes mellitus, Dietary deficiencies
$\square$ Accidental causes
- Falls when running or from heights
- Crushing by trees
- Savaging by crocodiles and sharks
- Effects of earthquakes, tsunamis and Violent storms
$\square$ Ritual, Punitive \& Legal Amputations
- Curing local pain
- In removing deformity
- Infection or gangrene
- In saving lives
$\square$ Cold steel \& Gunshot causes
- Iron \& steel weapons evolved fingers \& hands
- Destructive gunshot wounding

\section*{Types of amputation}
- Closed Amputation
- Open Amputation (Guillotine Operation)

\section*{Closed Amputation}
- It is done as an elective procedure
- After amputations, the soft tissues are closed primarily over the bony stump. E.g., above knee, below knee etc.

\section*{Open Amputation (Guillotine Operation)}
- It is done as an emergency procedure. E.g. life threatening infections
- After amputations, the wound is left open \& not closed.

\section*{Levels of Amputation}
- Amputation is performed at the most distal point that will heal successfully.
The site of amputation is determined by two factors:
- Circulation in the part
- functional usefulness (i.e., meets the requirements for the use of a prosthesis).

\section*{The circulatory status of the extremity is evaluated through}
- physical examination and diagnostic studies.
- Doppler flow studies with duplex ultrasound
- segmental blood pressure determinations
- transcutaneous PaO 2 of the extremity
- Angiography is performed if revascularization is considered an option.
NB:Muscle and skin perfusion is important for healing.
- The objective of surgery is to conserve as much extremity length as needed to preserve function and possibly to achieve a good prosthetic fit. Preservation of knee and elbow joints is desirable.
- Most amputations involving extremities can be eventually fitted with a prosthesis.
- The amputation of toes and portions of the foot can cause changes in gait and balance.

- A Syme amputation (modified ankle disarticulation amputation) is performed most frequently for extensive foot trauma and aims to produce a durable extremity end that can withstand full weight bearing.
- Below-knee amputation (BKA) is preferred to above-knee amputation (AKA) because of the importance of the knee joint and the energy requirements for walking.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_f5f777a197f2003eaba5g-084.jpg?height=1665&width=1895&top_left_y=156&top_left_x=114)

\section*{SYME'S AMPUTATION}
- CAN BE DONE IN-
1. ONE STAGE- ORICINAL / CLASSIC SYME'S AMPUTATION.
2. TWO STAGE- IN CASE OF CROSS INFECTION OF FOREFOOT.
3. MODIFIED AMPUTATION- MODIFIED TO CET A LESS BULBOUS AND MORE COSMETIC STUMP BY REMOVING METAPHYSEAL FLARE OF TIBIA AND BEVELING DISTAL END OF FIBULA.
- Knee disarticulations are most successful with young, active patients who can develop precise control of the prosthesis.
- When AKAs are performed, all possible length is preserved, muscles are stabilized and shaped, and hip contractures are prevented to maximize ambulatory potential.
- Most people who have a hip disarticulation amputation must rely on a wheelchair for mobility.

- Upper extremity amputations are performed with the goal of preserving maximal functional length.
- The prosthesis is fitted early to ensure maximum function.
- A staged amputation may be used when gangrene and infection exist.
- Initially, a guillotine amputation (eg, nonclosed residual limb) is performed to remove the necrotic and infected tissue
- The wound is débrided and allowed to drain.
- Sepsis is treated with systemic antibiotics.
- In a few days, after the infection has been controlled and the patient's condition has stabilized, a definitive amputation with skin closure is performed.

\section*{Complication of amputation}
- Haematomas
- Necrosis
-Stump pain
- Hyperesthesia of stump - excessive physical sensitivity, especially of the skin.
-Stump edema
- Bone overgrowth
- Causalgia- severe burning pain in a limb caused by injury to a peripheral nerve.

\section*{Complications}
- hemorrhage - Because major blood vessels have been severed, massive bleeding may occur.
-Infection - risk with all surgical procedures.
-skin breakdown,
>phantom limb pain,
- joint contracture.
- The risk of infection increases with contaminated wounds after traumatic amputation.
- Skin irritation caused by the prosthesis may result in skin breakdown.
- Phantom limb pain is caused by the severing of peripheral nerves.
- Joint contracture is caused by positioning and a protective flexion withdrawal pattern associated with pain and muscle imbalance.

\section*{Assignment}
- Make notes on Complications of amputation

\section*{Phantom Limb Pain}
- Occurs after surgical or traumatic amputation of a limb.
" Client experiences pain in the missing body part even though he is aware that the limb is gone.
" Pain may include itching, tingling, or pressure sensations, or it may be more severe, including burning or stabbing sensations.
- It may be due to stimulation of the severed nerves at the site of the amputation.
- Client complains of pain at the site of the removed body part, most often shortly after surgery.
- Some clients feel that the removed body part is in a distorted position.

\section*{Management of Phantom Pain}
- Phantom limb pain must be distinguished from stump pain because they are managed differently.
- Recognize that this pain is real and interferes with the amputee's activities of daily living.

\section*{Management of Phantom Pain}
- Some studies have shown that opioids are not as effective for phantom limb pain as they are for residual limb pain.
- Other drugs include intravenous infusion calcitonin, beta blockers,

\section*{Amputation care}

Nursing Management goals -relieving pain
-minimizing altered sensory perception
-promoting wound healing
-enhancing body image
-self-care

\section*{Pre-operative Care}
$\square$ Evaluate the neurovascular and functional status of the extremity, the nutritional status.
$\square$ Any concurrent health problems e.g, cardiac insufficiency, chronic respiratory problems, diabetes mellitus.
$\square$ Assist the patient to undergo investiaations. i.e blood arouping

\section*{Cont'd...}
$\square$ Assesses the patient's psychological status: emotional reaction, change in body image.
$\square$ Always give good nutrition, high in vitamins and proteins
$\square$ Correct and monitor Hb
$\square$ Teach the patient how to use assistive devices such as crutches
$\square$ Involve the patient in exercise programs.

\section*{Post-operative Care Management}
- The objective of treatment is to achieve healing of the amputation wound, the result being a non tender residual limb with healthy skin for prosthetic use.
- Healing is enhanced by gentle handling of the residual limb, control of residual limb edema through rigid or soft compression dressings, and use of aseptic technique in wound care to avoid infection.

\section*{Post-operative Care}
- Control surgical pain with opioid analgesics i.e. pethidine
- Closely monitor pt for hemorrhages, vital signs fluctuations
- Ensure good wound drainage, proper wound dressing
- Administration of antibiotics to decrease sepsis

\section*{Cont'd...}
- Physiotherapy to prevent the development of contractures.
- Care of the skin at the stump area,
- Enhance physical mobility by muscle strengthening and ROM exercise, position changes, elevation.
- Enhance healing: gentle handling of the residual limb, control of residual limb edema(rigid or soft compression dressings)
- use of aseptic technique in wound care to avoid infection.
- Education on use of prostheses.

A closed rigid cast, dressing or an elastic residual limb shrinker that covers the residual limb may be used to provide:
$\checkmark$ uniform compression
$\checkmark$ to support soft tissues,
$\checkmark$ to control pain, and
$\checkmark$ to prevent joint contractures.
- This rigid dressing technique is used as a means of creating a socket for immediate postoperative prosthetic fitting.
- The length of the prosthesis is tailored to the individual patient.
- Early minimal weight bearing on the residual limb with a rigid cast dressing produces little discomfort.
- The cast is changed in about 10 to 14 days.
- Fever, severe pain, or a loose-fitting cast may necessitate earlier replacement.
- A removable rigid dressing may be placed over a soft dressing to control edema, to prevent joint flexion contracture, and to protect the residual limb from unintentional trauma during transfer activities.
- This rigid dressing is removed several days after surgery for wound inspection
- Rigid dressing replaced to:
$\checkmark$ control edema.
$\checkmark$ Facilitates residual limb shaping.
- A soft dressing with or without compression may be used if there is significant wound drainage
- Frequent inspection of the residual limb is required.
- Residual limb wound hematomas are controlled with wound drainage devices to minimize infection e.g. Penrose tube.
- Monitor for potential complication i.e. infections

\section*{Exercise After Amputation}
- ROM to prevent flexion contractures, particularly of the hip and knee
" Trapeze and overhead frame
- Firm mattress
- Prone position every 3 to 4 hours
"Elevation of lower-leg residual limb controversial

\section*{Rehabilitation}
- The multidisciplinary rehabilitation team include(patient, nurse, physician, social worker, physical therapist, occupational therapist, psychologist, prosthetist, vocational rehabilitation worker) helps the patient achieve the highest possible level of function and participation in life activities
- Prosthetic clinics and amputee support groups facilitate this rehabilitation process
- Rehabilitation of the patient psychological support in accepting the sudden change in body image in accepting the sudden change in body image
- The patient is encouraged to be an active participant in self-care. physically be able to participate in a vigorous rehabilitation program.
- dealing with the stresses of hospitalization,
- Modification of lifestyle.
- need support as they grieve the loss and change in body image. Their reactions can include anger, bitterness, and hostility.
- Psychological issues (eg, denial, withdrawal) may be influenced by the type of support the patient receives from the rehabilitation team and by how quickly ADLs and use of the prosthesis are learned.
- Knowing the full options and capabilities available with the various prosthetic devices can give the patient a sense of control over the resulting disability

\title{
NURSING PROCESS \\ THE PATIENT UNDERGOING AN AMPUTATION
}

\section*{Assessment}
- Before surgery, the nurse must evaluate the neurovascular and functional status of the extremity through history and physical assessment.
- If the patient has experienced a traumatic amputation, the nurse assesses the function and condition of the residual limb.
- The nurse also assesses the circulatory status and function of the unaffected extremity.
- If infection or gangrene develops, the patient may have associated enlarged lymph nodes, fever, and purulent drainage.
- A culture and sensitivity test is obtained to determine the appropriate antibiotic therapy.
- The nurse evaluates the patient's nutritional status and develops a plan for nutritional care in consultation with a dietitian or metabolic support team, if indicated.
- A diet with adequate protein and vitamins is essential to promote wound healing.
- Any concurrent health problems (eg, dehydration, anemia, cardiac insufficiency, chronic respiratory problems, diabetes mellitus) need to be identified and treated so that the patient is in the best possible condition to withstand the surgical procedure.
- The use of corticosteroids, anticoagulants, vasoconstrictors, or vasodilators may influence management and prolong or delay wound healing.
- The nurse assesses the patient's psychological status.
- Evaluation of the patient's emotional reaction to amputation is important.
- Grief responses to permanent alterations in body image, function, and mobility are likely.
- Professional counseling can help the patient cope in the aftermath of amputation surgery.

\section*{Diagnosis \\ Nursing Diagnoses}

Based on the assessment data, the patient's major nursing
diagnoses may include the following:
- Acute pain related to amputation
- Disturbed sensory perception: phantom limb pain related
to amputation
- Impaired skin integrity related to surgical amputation
- Disturbed body image related to amputation of body
part
- Grieving and/or risk for complicated grieving related
to loss of body part and resulting disability
- Self-care deficit: feeding, bathing/hygiene, dressing/
grooming, or toileting, related to loss of extremity
- Impaired physical mobility related to loss of extremity

\section*{Collaborative Problems/Potential Complications}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Postoperative hemorrhage
- Infection
- Skin breakdown
- Planning and Goals
- The major goals of the patient may include
$\square$ relief of pain,
absence of altered sensory perceptions,
$\square_{\text {wound healing, }}$
$\square$ acceptance of altered body image,
$\square$ resolution of the grieving process,
$\square$ independence in self-care,
$\square$ restoration of physical mobility, and
absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{Relieving Pain}
- Pain may be incisional or may be caused by inflammation, infection, pressure on a bony prominence, or hematoma.
- Muscle spasms may add to the patient's discomfort.
- Surgical pain can be effectively controlled with opioid analgesics that may be accompanied with evacuation of a hematoma or accumulated fluid.
- Changing the patient's position or placing a light sandbag on the residual limb to counteract the muscle spasm may improve the patient's level of comfort.
- Evaluation of the patient's pain and responses to interventions is an important component of pain management.
- The pain may be an expression of grief and alteration of body image.

\section*{Minimizing Altered Sensory Perceptions}
- A person who has had an amputation may begin to experience phantom limb pain soon after surgery or 2 to 3 months after amputation.
- It occurs more frequently in patients who have had AKAs.
- The patient describes pain or unusual sensations,
such as numbness, tingling, or muscle cramps, as
well as a feeling that the extremity is present, crushed, cramped, or twisted in an abnormal position.
- When a patient describes phantom pains or sensations, the nurse acknowledges these feelings as real and encourages the patient to verbalize when in pain so that effective treatment may be given.
- Although phantom sensations diminish over time for many patients, they do not occur in all patients with amputations
- The pathogenesis of the phantom limb phenomenon is unknown.
- Keeping the patient active helps decrease the occurrence of phantom limb pain.
- Early intensive rehabilitation and residual limb desensitization with kneading massage bring relief.
- Distraction techniques and activity are helpful.
- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), ultrasound, or
- Local anesthetics may provide relief for some patients.
- Beta-blockers may relieve dull, burning discomfort;
- Antiseizure medications control stabbing and cramping pain; and
- Tricyclic antidepressants may not only alleviate phantom pain, they may also be prescribed to improve mood and coping ability.

\section*{Promoting Wound Healing}
- The residual limb must be handled gently.
- Whenever the dressing is changed, aseptic technique is required to prevent wound infection and possible osteomyelitis
- Residual limb shaping is
- The nurse instructs the patient and family to apply elastic wraps on the residual limb.
- Using ace wraps on the residual limb is discouraged because they may apply inconsistent pressure on the residual limb, causing problems with shaping it to fit a prosthetic.

\section*{Enhancing Body Image}
- Amputation is a procedure that alters the patient's body image.
- The nurse who has established a trusting relationship with the patient is better able to communicate acceptance of the patient who has experienced an amputation.
- The nurse encourages the patient to look at, feel, and care for the
- It is important to identify the patient's strengths and resources to facilitate rehabilitation.
- The nurse helps the patient regain the previous level of independent functioning.
- The patient who is accepted as a whole person is more readily able to resume responsibility for selfcare; self-concept improves, and body-image changes are accepted.
- Even with highly motivated patients, this process may take months.

\section*{Helping the Patient to Resolve Grieving}
- The loss of an extremity (or part of one) may come as a shock even if the patient was prepared preoperatively.
- The patient's behavior (eg, crying, withdrawal, apathy, anger) and expressed feelings (eg, depression, fear, helplessness) reveal how the patient is coping with the loss and working through the grieving process.
- The nurse creates an accepting and supportive atmosphere in which the patient and family are encouraged to express and share their feelings and work through the grief process.
- The support from family and friends promotes the patient's acceptance of the loss.
- The nurse helps the patient deal with immediate needs and become oriented to realistic rehabilitation goals and future independent functioning.
- Mental health and support group referrals may be appropriate

\section*{Promoting Independent Self-Care}
- Amputation of an extremity affects the patient's ability to provide adequate selfcare.
- The patient is encouraged to be an active participant in self-care.
- The patient needs time to accomplish these tasks and must not be rushed.
- Practicing an activity with consistent, supportive supervision in a relaxed environment enables the patient to learn selfcare skills.
- The patient and the nurse need to maintain positive attitudes and to minimize fatigue and frustration during the learning process.
- Independence in dressing, toileting, and bathing depends on balance, transfer abilities, and physiologic tolerance of the activities.
- The nurse works with the physical therapist and occupational therapist to teach and supervise the patient in these self-care activities.
- The patient with an upper extremity amputation has self-care deficits in feeding, bathing, and dressing.
- Assistance is provided only as needed; the nurse encourages the patient to learn to do these tasks, using assistive feeding and dressing aids when needed.
- The nurse, therapists, and prosthetist work with the patient to achieve maximum independence.

Helping the Patient to Achieve Physical Mobility
- Proper positioning prevents the development of hip or knee
- joint contracture in the patient with a lower extremity amputation.
- Abduction, external rotation, and flexion of the lower extremity are avoided.
- The residual limb may be placed in an extended position or elevated for a brief period after surgery.
- The nurse encourages the patient to turn from side to side and to assume a prone position, if possible, to stretch the flexor muscles and to prevent flexion contracture of the hip.
- The patient is encouraged not to sit for long periods of time to prevent flexion contracture.
- The legs should remain close together to prevent an abduction deformity.
- The nurse encourages the patient to use assistive devices to more readily perform self-care activities and to identify what home modifications, if any, should be made to perform these
- Postoperative ROM exercises are started early because contracture deformities develop rapidly. ROM exercises include hip and knee exercises for patients with BKAs and hip exercises for patients with AKAs.
- It is important that the patient understand the importance of

\section*{Review of A \& P}
- The musculoskeletal system includes the bones, joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and bursae of the body
- Bone is a type of connective tissue.
- It is made up of water, living cells, calcium and phosphorus as its main components.
- The cells making up the bone are
- osteoblast: bone-forming cell
- osteoclast: bone resorption cell
- osteocyte: mature bone cell
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_4f88f081ef4dd744eba8g-006.jpg?height=1647&width=2498&top_left_y=181&top_left_x=1)
- The bone is the hardest tissue in the body and when fully developed comprises of:
- Water 20 \%
- Organic material 30\% to 40\%
- Inorganic materials $40 \%$ to $50 \%$
- Inorganic material mainly constitutes of mineral salts especially calcium and phosphates.
- Organic materials comprise of bone cells and tissues
- There are two types of bone tissue - compact and cancellous. Bones are almost completely covered by periosteum which is a vascular fibrous membrane. Periosteum gives attachment to muscles.

\section*{Types of Bones}
- Bones are classified as short(metarcapols), irregular, flat or sesamoid(sternum), long bones e.g. femur

\section*{BONE DEVELOPMENT(osteogenesis)}
- This is the process of bone formation that begins before birth and is not completed until age 25 years. Long, short and irregular bones develop from cartilage models.
- Ossificationis the process by which the bone matrix (collagen fibers and ground substance) is formed and hardening minerals (eg, calcium salts) are deposited on the collagen fibers.
- results from deposits of both organic and inorganic bone elements.
- This further develops allowing for a clear demarcation of the diaphysis.
- Osteoblasts and osteoclasts are involved in bone

\section*{THE SKELETON}
- The human skeleton is divided into two main parts:
- the axial skeleton and
- the appendicular skeleton.
- The axial skeleton refers to the central, while appendicular refers to the attachments.
- The axial skeleton is made up of the skull, the vertebral column, the ribs and the sternum.
- The appendicular skeleton consists of the shoulder girdle, upper limbs, pelvic girdle and lower limbs.
- The total number of bones in the human body is at least 206 .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_4f88f081ef4dd744eba8g-010.jpg?height=1873&width=2451&top_left_y=1&top_left_x=0)

\section*{FUNCTIONS OF BONES}
$\checkmark$ Provide the basic framework of the body $\checkmark$ Provide points of attachments to muscles and tendons
$\checkmark$ Form a reservoir for calcium
$\checkmark$ Permit movement of the body as a whole by forming joints
$\checkmark$ Form boundaries of many cavities, which provides protection to organs within
$\checkmark$ Contain red bone marrow, which is involved in the production of blood cells

\section*{JOINTS}

Def: they are points in the body at which bones attach to each other. They form the points at which many movements can be made and positions changed.
- 3 main types of joints:
1. Fibrous joints, are fixed and immovable joints. E.g joints between skull bones (or sutures).
2. Cartilaginous joints, are slightly movable. They have cartilage between two bones. E.g joints between the vertebral bones.
3. Synovial (diarthrosisl) joints, are freely movable. Further subdivided into ball and socket joints, hinge joints, gliding joints, pivot and saddle joints.

\section*{MOVEMENTS OF JOINTS}
- Flexion: bending forward and backward. E.g knee joint.
- Extension: straightening or bending backwards.
- Abduction: movement away from the midline. E.g moving the arm or leg away from the body laterally.
- Adduction: movement towards the middle of body.
- Eversion: turning the sole of the foot outwards.
- Inversion: turning the sole of foot inwards.
- Supination: turning the palm up.
- Pronation: turning the palm downwards.
- Rotation: movement around the long axis. E.g the lower limb or the upper limb.
- Circumduction: a combination of adduction, flexion and extension.

\section*{DISORDERS OF BONES}
- Results from
- altered growth and development,
- disordered metabolism,
- neoplasm,
- injuries and their complications.
- The disorders occurring during growth and development include femoral anteversion where there is internal torsion or rotation of the femur and toeing-out of the foot with the foot flat and toes spread out. Many of the conditions resolve by themselves while a few may need surgery.

\section*{SCOLIOSIS}
- Scoliosis: is lateral deviation of the spinal column.
- Causes
-Idiopathic
- Certain diseases e.g poliomyelitis
- Manifested by
- Uneven shoulders and a
-Prominent scapula,
-Asymmetry of the flanks and
-Asymmetry of the thoracic cage.
-Rip humps
- Kyphosis : an exaggeration in the curvature of the thoracic spine.
- This may lead to a change in the volume of the thoracic space thus affect the functional lung capacities.
- Lumbar lordosis: an exaggeration in the curvature of the lumbar spine(swayback). This normally occurs during growth and development.

\section*{OSTOEPOROSIS}

Def: a disorder in which the rate of bone reshaping (resorption) is greater than the rate of formation.
- This results in a loss of organic matrix and mineral content. The bone then becomes brittle, fragile and fractures easily. It is common among the elderly, post-menopausal women, people with Cushing's syndrome and those who are on steroid treatment.
- The manifestations of osteoporosis are pain and spontaneous fractures. In some cases, wedging and collapse of vertebrae causes loss of height. It may also lead to kyphosis

Causes
-Diabetes
-Rheumatoid arthritis
- Leukemia
PathophysiologyIn the normal bone forming process, boneremodeling occurs at the same pace asbone resorption. In osteoporosis, there israpid bone loss. This leads to thinning ofthe lamellar with deformity and latercollapse. The bone may easily fracture.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

\section*{Genetics}
- Caucasian or Asian
- Female
- Family history
- Small frame
- Predisposes to low bone mass
- Hormones (estrogen, calcitonin, and testosterone) inhibit bone loss. Reduces nutrients needed for bone remodeling.
- Bones need stress for bone maintenance

\section*{Lifestyle choices}
- Caffeine
- Alcohol
- Smoking
- Lack of exposure to sunligh:

\section*{Medications e.g.,}
corticosteroids, anti-seizure medications, heparin, thyroid hormone
Co-morbidity e.g., anorexia nervosa, hyperthyroidism, mal-absorption syndrome, renal failure

\section*{Nutrition}
- Low calcium intake
- Low vitamin D intake
- High phosphate intake (carbonated beverages)
- Inadequate calories
- Reduces osteogenesis in bone remodeling
- Affects calcium absorption and metabolism
- Reduces nutrients needed for bone remodeling

\section*{Risk factors}

\section*{Individual Risk Factors}
- Female, Caucasian, non-Hispanic or Asian
- Increased age
- Low weight and body mass index
- Estrogen deficiency or menopause
- Family history
- Low initial bone mass
- Contributing, coexisting medical conditions (eg, celiac disease)
and medications (eg, corticosteroids, antiseizure medications)

\section*{Lifestyle Risk Factors}
- Diets low in calcium and vitamin D
- Cigarette smoking
- Use of alcohol and/or caffeine
- Lack of weight-bearing exercise
- Lack of exposure to sunshine

\section*{Risk-Lowering Strategies}
- Increased dietary calcium and vitamin

D intake
- Smoking cessation
- Alcohol and caffeine consumption in moderation
- Regular weight-bearing exercise regimen
- Walk or exercise out of doors

\section*{Diagnosis}
- History and clinical features
- X-ray
- Quantitative ultrasound studies (QUS) of the heel

\section*{Clinical Features}
- Acute onset back pain in low thoracic region cause vertebral fracture
- Kyphosis (postural changes)

\section*{Management}
- Prevention of the condition is through early administration of calcium supplements to encourage bone strengthening. Others include vitamin D, Fluoride.
- Give health messages about dangers of smoking and need to avoid it.
- Women approaching menopause may require assessment for suitability of hormone replacement therapy.
- Life style changes including quitting cigarette smoking, curtailing alcohol intake, exercising regularly, and consuming a balanced diet with adequate calcium and vitamin D;
- Medications that stop bone loss and increase bone strength, such as alendronate (Fosamax), risedronate (Actonel), raloxifene (Evista), ibandronate (Boniva), calcitonin (Calcimar);
- Medications that increase bone formation such as teriparatide (Forteo).

\section*{OSTEOMALACIA AND RICKETS}
- These terms refer to the same process occurring at different ages. In both cases, there is a deficiency of vitamin D. characterized by inadequate mineralization of bone.
- If the deficiency occurs before fusion of the epiphyseal plates then the bones get deformed, but if fusion has already occurred, then the bones will bend easily.
- Rickets therefore occurs in children and osteomalacia in adults.
- Both conditions are caused by malabsorption syndromes, lack of exposure to sunlight and excess secretion of vitamin D.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF OSTEOMALACIA}
- The primary defect in osteomalacia is a deficiency of activated vitamin D (calcitriol), which promotes calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and facilitates mineralization of bone.
- The supply of calcium and phosphate in the extracellular fluid is low. Without adequate vitamin D, calcium and phosphate are not moved to calcification sites in bones.
- Osteomalacia may result from failed calcium absorption (e.g, mal-absorption syndrome) or from excessive loss of calcium from the body. Gastrointestinal disorders e.g chronic pancreatitis, in which fats are inadequately absorbed cause osteomalacia through loss of vitamin D (along with other fat soluble vitamins) and calcium, the latter being excreted in the feces with fatty acids.
- Liver and kidney diseases can produce a lack of vitamin D because these are the organs that convert vitamin D to its active form.
- Severe renal insufficiency results in acidosis. The body uses available calcium to combat the acidosis, and PTH stimulates the release of skeletal calcium in an attempt to reestablish a physiologic pH. During this continual drain of skeletal calcium, bony fibrosis occurs and bony cysts form.
- Hyperparathyroidism leads to skeletal decalcification and thus to osteomalacia by increasing phosphate excretion in the urine.
- Prolonged use of antiseizure medication (eg, phenytoin,

\section*{ct}
- The malnutrition type of osteomalacia (deficiency in vitamin D often associated with poor intake of calcium
- Clinical manifestations
- there is softening and weakening of the skeleton, causing pain, tenderness to touch, bowing of the bones, and pathologic fractures. On physical examination, skeletal deformities (spinal kyphosis and bowed legs) give patients an unusual appearance and a waddling or limping gait.
- muscle weakness, and unsteadiness
- Laboratory studies show low serum calcium and phosphorus levels and a moderately elevated alkaline phosphatase concentration.

\section*{Management of osteomalacia}
- The underlying cause of osteomalacia is corrected if possible.
- If caused by malabsorption, increased doses of vitamin D, along with supplemental calcium, are usually prescribed.
- Exposure to sunlight.
- If it is dietary in origin, a diet with adequate protein and increased calcium and vitamin D is provided. i.e milk, cereals
- . Some persistent orthopedic deformities may need to be treated with braces or surgery
- Physical, psychological, and pharmaceutical measures are used to reduce the patient's discomfort and pain. When assisting the patient to change positions, the nurse handles the patient gently, and pillows are used to support the body.

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS, OSTEOMALACIA}
$\checkmark$ The preventiAND ostCKEFUSTE focuses on adequate calcium intake and calcium supplementation..
$\checkmark$ Oestrogen replacement therapy after menopause is used to prevent osteoporosis among post-menopausal women.
$\checkmark$ Calcitonin treatment, which acts by blocking the effects of the parathyroid hormone on bone resorption. The drug etidionate disodium also inhibits bone resorption.
$\checkmark$ Weight bearing exercises to prevent osteoporosis.
$\checkmark$ Keep patients with osteoporosis ambulated to prevent further loss of bone substance as a result of immobility.
$\checkmark$ Institute measures to avoid pathological fractures in patients with osteoporosis.
$\checkmark$ Health education on the prevention of home accidents. Those at risk should avoid walking on slippery floors, and should wear shoes with a firm sole.
$\checkmark$ Supplementation of vitamin D.
$\checkmark$ Calcium and phosphorous intake may also be supplemented after proper investigation.
- They may be primary tumors or metastatic tumors from primary cancers elsewhere in the body
- Benign tumors of the bone and soft tissue are more common. generally are slow growing and well circumscribed and present few symptoms,
- Benign primary neoplasms of the musculoskeletal system include osteochondroma, enchondroma, bone cyst (eg, aneurysmal bone cyst), osteoid osteoma, rhabdomyoma, and fibroma.
- Osteochondroma is the most common benign bone tumor. It usually occurs as a large projection of bone at the end of long bones
- A painful tumor that occurs in children and young adults is the osteoid osteoma.
- Giant cell tumors (osteoclastomas) are benign for long periods

\section*{MALIGNANT BONE TUMORS}
- Primary malignant musculoskeletal tumors are relatively rare and arise from connective and supportive tissue cells (sarcomas) or bone marrow elements.they include multiple myeloma; osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma,, and fibrosarcoma. Soft tissue sarcomas include liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma of soft tissue, and rhabdomyo sarcoma.
- The usual tumor sites include the pelvis, femur, humerus, spine, scapula, and tibia.
- METASTATIC BONE DISEASE Metastatic bone disease (secondary bone tumor) is more common than any primary bone tumor.
- The conditions associated with bone tumours are infections, pathological fractures,inflammatory conditions or developmental.
- Manifestations of bone cancer include
- bone pain that lasts over a week and
- unexplained swelling over a particular bone.
- warm skin over the affected bones and
- prominent veins.
- Weight loss, malaise, and fever may be present.
- Bone tumours are rare in adults but if present, they rapidly metastasize and cause bone destruction and organ involvement e.g multiple myeloma.

\section*{Management}
- The goal of primary bone tumor treatment is to destroy or remove the tumor.
- This may be accomplished by surgical excision, Chemotherapy, used to suppress plasma cell growth in the bone marrow.
- Steroids are also given to these patients.
- However, both these management methods increase the patient's susceptibility to infection thus, good infection prevention and control should be practiced.
- In osteoblastoma and sarcoma, chemotherapy, surgery and radiation may improve survival rates.
- The treatment of metastatic bone cancer is palliative. The thera- peutic goal is to relieve the patient's pain and discomfort while promoting quality of life.

\section*{management of metastatic bone tumour}
- Pain must be assessed accurately and managed with adequate and appropriate opioid, nonopioid analgesics
- structural support and stabilization are needed to prevent pathologic fracture and pain by prophylactic internal fixation.
- Hypercalcemia from breakdown of bone Treatment includes hydration with IV administration of normal saline solution, diuresis, mobilization, and medications such as bisphosphonates, and calcitonin.
- Because inactivity leads to loss of bone mass and increased calcium in the blood, the nurse assists the patient to increase activity and ambulation.
- Blood product transfusions restore hematologic factors.

\section*{Goals of management.}
$\checkmark$ Ensuring satisfactory pain relief
$\checkmark$ Enabling the patient to maintain preferred activities
$\checkmark$ Encouraging the patient to accept body image changes resulting from chemotherapy radiation and surgery
$\checkmark$ Decreasing the possibility of injury
$\checkmark$ Educating the patient on disease progression and prognosis
$\checkmark$ Paying attention to pathological fractures, spinal cord compression and limb amputation. This ensured through
the affected extremities must be supported and handled gently. Use of External supports, Prescribed weight-bearing restrictions must be followed. use assistive devices safely

\section*{Ct...}
- monitoring and managing potential complications i.e
- Delayed Wound Healing, Inadequate Nutrition
- Osteomyelitis and Wound Infections Hypercalcemia. The nursing care of a patient who has undergone excision of a bone tumor include Vital signs are monitored; blood loss is assessed; and monitor for complications i.e deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, infection
- promoting coping skills The nurse encourages the patient and family to verbalize their fears, concerns, and feelings. They need to be supported as they deal with the impact of the malignant bone tumor.

\section*{OSTEOMYELITIS}
is an infection of the bone.
The bone becomes infected by one of three modes:
- Extension of soft tissue infection (e.g., infected pressure or vascular ulcer, incisional infection)
- Direct bone contamination from bone surgery, open fracture, or traumatic injury (e.g., gunshot wound)
- Hematogenous (blood borne) spread from other sites of infection (e.g., infected tonsils, boils, infected teeth, upper respiratory infections). Patients who are at high risk include those who are poorly nourished, elderly, or obese. impaired immune systems, those with chronic illness (eg, diabetes, )and those receiving longterm corticosteroid therapy.

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- Staphylococcus aureus causes 70\% to 80\% of bone infections. Other pathogenic organisms include Proteus and Pseudomonas species and Escherichia coli.
- The initial response to infection is inflammation, increased vascularity, and edema. After 2 or 3 days, thrombosis of the blood vessels occurs in the area, resulting in ischemia with bone necrosis.
- The infection extends into the medullary cavity and under the periosteum and may spread into adjacent soft tissues and joints. Unless the infective process is treated promptly, a bone abscess forms. The resulting abscess cavity contains dead bone tissue (the sequestrum), which does not easily liquefy and drain. Therefore, the cavity cannot collapse and heal, as occurs in soft tissue abscesses.
- New bone growth (the involucrum) forms and surrounds the sequestrum. Although healing appears to take place, a chronically infected sequestrum remains and produces recurring abscesses throughout the patient's life. This is referred to as chronic osteomyelitis.

\section*{Clinical manifestations}
- When the infection is blood-borne, the onset is usually sudden, occurring often with the clinical manifestations of
- septicemia (e.g., chills, high fever, rapid pulse, general malaise).
- The infected area becomes painful, swollen, and extremely tender.
- constant, pulsating pain that intensifies with movement as a result of the pressure of the collecting pus.
- . The area is swollen, warm, painful, and tender to touch.
- The patient with chronic osteomyelitis presents with a continuously draining sinus or experiences recurrent periods of pain, inflammation, swelling, and drainage

\section*{Diagnosis}
- X-ray
- Magnetic resonance imaging
- Blood studies(elevated leukocyte levels and an elevated sedimentation rate)
- Wound and blood culture studies(to identify appropriate antibiotic therapy)

\section*{Prevention}
$\checkmark$ Elective orthopedic surgery should be postponed if the patient has a current infection (e.g., urinary tract infection, sore throat) or a recent history of infection.
$\checkmark$ During orthopedic surgery, careful attention is paid to the surgical environment and to techniques to decrease direct bone contamination.
$\checkmark$ Prophylactic antibiotics, administered to achieve adequate tissue levels at the time of surgery and for 24 hours after surgery.
$\checkmark$ Urinary catheters and drains are removed as soon as possible to decrease the incidence of hematogenous spread of infection.
$\checkmark$ Aseptic postoperative wound care reduces the incidence of superficial infections and osteomyelitis.
$\checkmark$ Prompt management of soft tissue infections reduces extension of infection to the bone.
$\checkmark$ When patients who have had joint replacement surgery undergo dental procedures or other invasive procedures (e.g., cystoscopy), prophylactic antibiotics are recommended.

\section*{Medical management}
- Antibiotic therapy depends on the results of blood and wound cultures. (I.V antibiotics3-6 weeks,oral for 2 months)
- Control pain by adminstering analgesics i.e diclofenac.
- General supportive measures (e.g., hydration, diet high in vitamins and protein, correction of anemia) should be instituted.
- The area affected with osteomyelitis is immobilized to decrease discomfort and to prevent pathologic fracture of the weakened bone.
-Warm wet soaks for 20 minutes several times a day to increase circulation.

\section*{Surgical management}
- The infected bone is surgically exposed, the purulent and necrotic material is removed, and the area is irrigated with sterile saline solution.
- Antibiotic-impregnated beads may be placed in the wound for direct application of antibiotics for 2 to 4 weeks. IV antibiotic therapy is continued.
- In chronic osteomyelitis, antibiotics are adjunctive therapy to surgical debridement.
- A sequestrectomy (removal of enough involucrum to enable the surgeon to remove the sequestrum) is performed.
- Wound irrigation using sterile physiologic saline solution may be performed for 7 to 8 days.
- Specific nursing activities include
- assesses the patient for risk factors (eg, older age, dia- betes, long-term corticosteroid therapy) and for a history of pre- vious injury, infection, or orthopedic surgery
- RELIEVING PAIN
- The affected part may be immobilized with a splint to decrease pain and muscle spasm.
- Elevation reduces swelling and associated discomfort
- Adminster prescribed analgesics
- IMPROVING PHYSICAL MOBILITY
- of assistive devices such as crutches,
- The joints above and below the affected part should be gently placed through their range of motion.

\section*{- CONTROLLING THE INFECTIOUS PROCESS}
- close monitoring of the patient,
- promotion of drainage,
- use of antibiotics,.
- changes dressings using aseptic technique
- use of fluids,
- good nutrition to the patient diet high in protein and vitamin
patient education.
- The patient and family must learn and recognize the importance of strictly adhering to the therapeutic regimen of antibiotics and preventing falls or other injuries

\section*{FRACTURES}

\section*{Def: A fracture is any break in the continuity of bone.}

\section*{Classification of Fractures}
- They are classified according to:
- Location
- Type
- Direction or pattern of fracture line

\section*{1. Location}

Long bones can be described as having 3 parts; proximal, mid-shaft and distal. A fracture of the long bone is described in relation to its position in the bone.

\section*{2. Types of Fracture}
- This is in relation to its
- communication to the environment,
- degree of break in continuity of the bone,
- character of fracture.
- Pattern of fracture line
- E.g, an open fracture(compound/complex) communicates with the environment because it penetrates the skin, while a closed fracture (simple) does not penetrate the skin.
- Degree of break in a continuity of a bone e.g.
- incomplete (green stick)-
- complete- break across the entire cross-section of the bone and is frequently displaced
- Character of fracture which is described as comminuted, impacted, segmental, etc.
- The pattern of fracture line can be described as transverse, spiral, oblique, etc.

\section*{- Clinical features}
-Pain at site of injury due to muscle spasm
-Discoloration of the skin (ecchymosis) due to bleeding into tissues
-Swelling due to hematoma formation
- Loss of function due to pain and deformity
-Deformity depending on force and muscle tissue surrounding muscles e.g. angulation, shortening of extremity.
-Shortening: because of the contraction of the muscles that are attached above and below the site of the fracture.
- Crepitus: When the extremity is examined with the hands, a grating sensation can be felt. It is caused by the rubbing of the bone fragments against each other.
- Diagnosis
-This is made from the history e.g. fall or trauma in road traffic accidents.
-An x-ray examination confirms diagnosis.

\section*{fractures}
- Avulsion: a fracture in which a fragment of bone has been pulled away by a ligament or tendon and its attachment.
- Compression: a fracture in which bone has been compressed (seen in vertebral fractures)
- Stress: a fracture that results from repeated loading without bone and muscle recovery

An open fracture where a wound in the skin communicates with the fracture.
- Open fractures are graded according to the following criteria:
* Grade I is a clean wound less than 1 cm long.
* Grade II is a larger wound without extensive soft tissue damage.
* Grade III is highly contaminated, has extensive soft tissue damage, and is the most severe.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_4f88f081ef4dd744eba8g-061.jpg?height=515&width=1923&top_left_y=508&top_left_x=212)

An extracapsular fracture - the bone is broken outside of the joint.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_4f88f081ef4dd744eba8g-062.jpg?height=528&width=2004&top_left_y=559&top_left_x=181)

An intracapsular fracture - the bone is broken inside the joint.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_4f88f081ef4dd744eba8g-063.jpg?height=470&width=1991&top_left_y=690&top_left_x=41)

Comminuted fracture where the bone has splintered into fragments

A longitudinal fracture where the break runs parallel with the bone.

A transverse fracture - the break runs across the bone.

An oblique fracture occurs when the break runs in a slanting direction across the bone.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_4f88f081ef4dd744eba8g-067.jpg?height=658&width=2371&top_left_y=427&top_left_x=90)

A spiral fracture is where the break coils around the bone

A pathologic fracture occurs when the break is at the site of bone disease.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_4f88f081ef4dd744eba8g-069.jpg?height=1175&width=1735&top_left_y=219&top_left_x=373)

A depressed fracture occurs when a piece of the skull is broken off and driven inwards

\section*{BONE НЕАЦNG}

Fracture healing occurs in four areas, including:
1. Bone marrow, where endothelial cells rapidly undergo transformation and become osteoblastic bone-forming cells.
2. Bone cortex, where new osteons are formed
3. Periosteum, where a hard callus/bone is formed through intramembranous ossification peripheral to the fracture, and where a cartilage model is formed through endochondral ossification adjacent to the fracture site.
4. External soft tissue, where a bridging callus (fibrous tissue) stabilizes the fracture.

\section*{process of tracture healing}
1. Hematoma and inflammation: After injury there is bleeding into the injured tissue and formation of a fracture hematoma.
The injured area is invaded by macrophages which debride the area. Inflammation, swelling, and pain are present. .
2. Angiogenesis and cartilage formation: Under the influence of signaling molecules, cell proliferation and differentiation occur. Blood vessels and cartilage overlie the fracture.
3. Cartilage calcification: Chondrocytes in the cartilage callus form matrix vesicles, which regulate calcification of the cartilage. Enzymes within these matrix vesicles prepare the cartilage for calcium release and deposit
4. Cartilage removal: The calcified cartilage is invaded by blood vessels and becomes resorbed by chondroblasts and osteoclasts. It is replaced by woven bone similar to that of the growth plate.
5. Bone formation: Minerals continue to be deposited until the bone is firmly reunited. With major adult long bone fractures, ossification takes 3 to 4 months.
6. Remodeling: consists of remodeling the new bone into its former structural arrangement. May take months to years, depending on the extent of bone modification needed.

\section*{FRACTURE HEALING PROCESS}
- Factors enhancing fracture healing:
- Adequate nutrition
- Adequate blood supply
- Absence of infection
- Immobilization of fracture fragments
-Exercise: weight bearing for long bones
- Hormones: growth hormone, thyroid, calcitonin, vitamin D,

\section*{ct}
- Factors hindering bone healing:
* Presence of infective organisms e.g. streptococci
* Fat embolism in medullary canal
* Excessive bone tissue fragments
* Deficient blood supply
* Continued mobility (lack of proper reduction and immobilization)
* Age - old age due to slowing
* Nature of injury
* Type of bone lost
* Metabolic bone disease (eg, Paget's disease)

\section*{manaciement}
- The emergency management of a fracture involves:
- Assessing circulation airway, and breathing.
- Assessing any bleeding sites and controlling bleeding
- Treatment of any life threatening injury
- Immobilisation by use of splints- the extremity is supported above and below the fracture site to prevent rotation as well as angular motion. With an open fracture, the wound is covered with a clean (sterile) dressing to prevent contamination of deeper tissues. No attempt is made to reduce the fracture.
- Applying cold compresses
- Elevating the extremity
- Minimising mobility
- Monitoring the patient closely

\section*{Principles of fracture management}
- The principle management of fractures falls along 3 lines:
a) Fracture reduction
b) Immobilisation
c) Rehabilitation (restoration of fun

\section*{Reduction ("setting" the bone)}
refers to restoration of the fracture fragments to anatomic alignment and rotation.
Aim: to replace the bone fragments to as near as normal anatomical position as possible. Method selected depends on the nature of the fracture

\section*{Methods used are:}
- Open reduction. This is a surgical method of bringing the fractured parts together.
- Closed reduction. Here manipulation is used without viewing the fractures. An x-ray must be taken immediately after.

\section*{Closed Reduction.}
- Accomplished by bringing the bone fragments into apposition (i.e., placing the ends in contact) through manipulation and manual traction.
- The extremity is held in the desired position while the physician applies a cast, splint, or other device. Reduction under anesthesia with percutaneous pinning may be used.
- The immobilizing device maintains the reduction and stabilizes the extremity for bone healing.
- X-rays are obtained to verify that the bone fragments are correctly aligned.

\section*{Open Reduction.}
- Through a surgical approach, the fracture fragments are reduced.
- Internal fixation devices (metallic pins, wires, screws, plates, nails, or rods) may be used to hold the bone fragments in position until solid bone healing occurs.
- Advantage: Allows direct visualisation of fracture of the surrounding tissues.
- Disadvantage: Anaesthesia is required and there is the risk of infection if strict surgical asepsis is not maintained.
- These devices may be attached to the sides of bone, or they may be inserted through the bony fragments or directly into the medullary cavity of the bone.
- Internal fixation devices ensure firm approximation and fixation of the bony fragments.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_4f88f081ef4dd744eba8g-079.jpg?height=1380&width=2392&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=70)

Techniques of internal fixation. (A) Plate and six screws for a transverse or short oblique fracture. (B) Screws for a long oblique or spiral fracture. (C) Screws for a long butterfly
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_4f88f081ef4dd744eba8g-080.jpg?height=1149&width=1525&top_left_y=156&top_left_x=478)
(D) Plate and six screws for a short butterfly fragment. (E) Medullary nail for a segmental

\section*{Immobilisation}
- The aim is to prevent movement of injured parts already reduced.
- The bone fragments must be immobilized, or held in correct position and alignment, until union occurs.
- It is accomplished through the use of:
- External devices e.g. splints, plaster casts, external fixation devices or traction.
- Internal devices inserted during open reduction e.g. screws, nails, plates.

\section*{Maintaining and restoring function}
$\checkmark$ Reduction and immobilization are maintained as prescribed to promote bone and soft tissue healing.
$\checkmark$ Swelling is controlled by elevating the injured extremity and applying ice as prescribed.
$\checkmark$ Neurovascular status (circulation, movement, sensation) is monitored, and the orthopedic surgeon is notified immediately if signs of neurovascular compromise are identified.
$\checkmark$ Restlessness, anxiety, and discomfort are controlled with a variety of approaches, such as reassurance, position changes, and pain relief strategies, including use of analgesics.
$\checkmark$ Isometric and muscle-setting exercises are encouraged to minimize disuse atrophy and to promote circulation.

\section*{$\checkmark$ Participation in activities of daily living} (ADLs) is encouraged to promote independent functioning and self-esteem.
$\checkmark$ Gradual resumption of activities is promoted within the therapeutic prescription.
$\checkmark$ With internal fixation, the surgeon determines the amount of movement and weight-bearing stress the extremity can withstand and prescribes level of activity.

\section*{Nursing management}

\section*{PATIENTS WITH CLOSED FRACTURES}
$\checkmark$ Encouraging patients with closed (simple) fractures to return to their usual activities as rapidly as possible.
$\checkmark$ Teaching patients how to control swelling and pain associated with the fracture and with soft tissue trauma and encouraging them to be active within the limits of the fracture immobilization.
$\checkmark$ Teaching exercises to maintain the health of unaffected muscles and to increase the strength of muscles needed for transferring and for using assistive devices (e.g., crutches, walker, special utensils).
$\checkmark$ With the physical therapist; teaching patients how to use assistive devices safely.
$\checkmark$ Making plans to help patients modify their home environment as needed and to secure personal assistance if necessary.
$\checkmark$ Patient teaching on self-care, medication information, monitoring for potential complications, and the need for continuing health care supervision.

\section*{PATIENTS WITH OPEN FRACTURES}

In an open fracture, there is risk of osteomyelitis, tetanus, and gas gangrene.
The objectives of management are to
- prevent infection of the wound, soft tissue, and bone and
- to promote healing of soft tissue and bone.
$\checkmark$ Administration of tetanus prophylaxis if indicated.
$\checkmark$ Serial irrigation and debridement to remove anaerobic organisms.
$\checkmark$ Intravenous antibiotics are prescribed to prevent or treat infection.
$\checkmark$ Prompt, thorough wound irrigation and debridement in the operating room are necessary.
$\checkmark$ Devitalized bone fragments are removed.
$\checkmark$ The fracture is carefully reduced and stabilized by external fixation or intra-medullary nails.
$\checkmark$ Any damage to blood vessels, soft tissue, muscles, nerves, and tendons is treated..
$\checkmark$ Heavily contaminated wounds are left unsutured and dressed with sterile gauze to permit swelling and wound drainage.
$\checkmark$ Wound irrigation and debridement may be repeated, removing infected and devitalized tissue and increasing vascularity in the region.
$\checkmark$ After it has been determined that infection is not present, the wound is closed in 5 to 7 days, and all dead space is obliterated by grafting of autogenous skin or a flap.
$\checkmark$ Elevation the extremity to minimize edema.
$\checkmark$ Assessing neurovascular status frequently.
$\checkmark$ Measuring the patient's temperature at regular intervals and monitoring the patient for signs of infection.
$\checkmark$ In 4 to 8 weeks, bone grafting may be necessary to bridge bone defects and to stimulate bone healing.

\section*{TRACTION}
- Traction involves a steady pull on a body part. This is a method of reduction and immobilization used to maintain fractures apart but allowing sufficient contact for healing.
- Traction may be either skin or skeletal.
- SKIN TRACTION
- the pull is transmitted to the skin on the fractured bone. Accomplished by using adhesive or non-adhesive traction tape or other skin traction devices such as a cast, a boot, a belt
- TYPES.
- Buck's Extension Traction
- is skin traction to the lower leg. The pull is exerted in one plane when partial or temporary immobilization is desired. applies the pulling force in a straight line with the body part resting on the bed

\section*{CT}

\section*{- SKELETAL TRACTION}

The force is directly applied to the bone by use of pulls. Accomplished by attaching pins, screws, wires
- TYPES .
- Balanced suspension traction: supports the affected extremity off the bed with thomas splint and allows for some patient movement without disruption of the line of pull. The pull is exerted against an opposing force provided by the weight of the body when the foot of the bed is raised
- Fixed Traction: The pull is exerted against a fixed point; e.g., the tapes are tied to the crosspiece of a Thomas splint and pull the leg down

\section*{Other forms of traction}
- Manual Traction: is traction that is accomplished by a persons hands exerting a pulling force. This is temporary traction that may be used when
- applying a cast,
- giving skin care under a Buck's extension foam boot, or
- adjusting the traction apparatus.

\section*{Indications:}
- To reduce a fracture
- Maintain alignment
- Overcome and minimize muscle spasm
- Correct deformities
- Immobilize fractures;
- Increase space between opposing surfaces.
- Traction must be applied in the correct direction and magnitude to obtain its therapeutic effects.
- At times, traction needs to be applied in more than one direction to achieve the desired line of pull. When this is done, one of the lines of pull counteracts the other. These lines of pull are known as the vectors of force. The actual resultant pulling force is somewhere between the two lines of pull.
- The effects of traction are evaluated with x-ray studies, and adjustments are made if necessary.
- Traction is used primarily as a short-term intervention until other modalities, such as external or internal fixation, are possible.
- This reduces the risk of disuse syndrome and minimizes the length of hospitalization, often allowing the patient to be cared for in the home setting.

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE TRACTION}
1. Whenever traction is applied, counter-traction must be used to achieve effective traction. Counter-traction is the force acting in the opposite direction
2. Traction must be continuous to be effective in reducing and immobilizing fractures.
3. Skeletal traction is never interrupted.
4. Weights are not removed unless intermittent traction is prescribed.
5. Any factor that might reduce the effective pull or alter its resultant line of pull must be eliminated:
- The patient must be in good body alignment in the center of the bed when traction is applied.
- Ropes must be unobstructed.
- Weights must hang free and not rest on the bed or floor.
- Knots in the rope or the footplate must not touch the pulley or the foot of the bed.

\section*{SPECIFIC CARE FOR A PATIENT ON TRACTION}
maintain continuous traction and avoid adding weight.
Ensure effective traction by proper position to maintain leg in neutral position
- Skin care
- Monitor the skin in contact with tape or foam ,palpate area of traction tape daily to detect underlying tenderness,
- Provide back care every 2 hrs to avoid pressure ulcer
- Keep the skin clean around pin sites in skeletal traction to avoid infections.
- Nerve Pressure( peroneal nerve) care by(promoting neurovascular unction)
- Regularly assess sensation and motion.
- Immediately investigate any complaint of burning sensation under the traction bandage or boot.
- Promptly report altered sensation or motor function.
- circulation- assess for Peripheral pulses, color, capillary refill, and temperature of the fingers or toe, Indicators of DVT

\section*{ct}
- PROMOTING EXERCISE Patient exercises, within the therapeutic limits of the traction, assist in maintaining muscle strength and tone and in promoting circulation. Active exercises include pulling up on the trapeze, flexing and extending the feet, and Isometric exercises of the immobilized extremity
- promoting understanding of the treatment regimen aids in active participation
- REDUCING ANXIETY Before any traction is applied, the patient needs to be informed about the procedure, its purpose, and its implications. The nurse encourages the patient to participate in decisions that affect care.
- achieving a maximum level of comfort by providing firm mattress and frequent positioning, by making sure the bed linens remain wrinklefree and dry.
- monitoring and managing potential complications i.e DVT, pneumonia, constipation ,urinary stasis

\section*{CASTS}

Def: A cast is a rigid external immobilizing device that is molded to the contours of the body.
The purposes of a cast are
- to immobilize a reduced fracture,
- To correct a deformity,
- to apply uniform pressure to underlying soft tissue, or
- to support and stabilize weakened joints.
- Casts permit mobilization of the patient while restricting movement of a body part.
- The skin should be intact, clean and well padded before a cast is applied to avoid risks of infection.
- Casts are molded over the affected body part after closed reduction has been done.

\section*{TYPES OF CASTS}
-Short arm cast: Extends from below the elbow to the palmar crease.
-Long arm cast: Extends from the upper level of the axillary fold to the proximal palmar crease. The elbow usually is immobilized at a right angle.
- Short leg cast: Extends from below the knee to the base of the.
-The Long leg cast: Extends from the junction of the upper and middle third of the thigh to the base of the toes. The knee may be slightly flexed.
-Walking cast: A short or long leg cast reinforced for strength.
-Body cast: Encircles the trunk.
- Shoulder spica cast: A body jacket that encloses the trunk and the shoulder and elbow.
- Hip space cast :Encloses the trunk and a lower extremity.

\section*{Casting materials}
1) Non-plaster: fiberglass casts
- They are water-activated polyurethane materials having the versatility of plaster but are lighter in weight, stronger, water resistant, and durable. .
- Non-plaster casts
- are porous and therefore diminish skin problems.
- They do not soften when wet, which allows for hydrotherapy when appropriate.
- When wet, they are dried with a hair drier on a cool setting;
- They are used for non-displaced fractures with minimal swelling and for long-term wear.
2) Plaster
- Rolls of plaster bandage are wet in cool water and applied smoothly to the body. A crystallizing reaction occurs, and heat is given off.
- The crystallization process produces a rigid dressing. The speed of the reaction varies from a few minutes to 15 to 20 minutes. After the plaster sets, the cast remains wet and soft.
- While damp, the cast can be dented. Therefore, it must be handled with the palms of the hand and not allowed to rest on hard surfaces or sharp edges. Cast dents may press on the skin causing irritation and skin breakdown.
- The plaster cast requires 24 to 72 hours to dry completely, depending on its thickness and the environmental drying conditions

\section*{Specific casts mngt considerations}

\section*{1. Arm casts}

\section*{Nursing interventions}
1. Elevating the immobilized arm to control swelling.
2. When the patient is lying down, the arm is elevated so that each joint is positioned higher than the preceding proximal joint
3. A sling may be used when the patient ambulates.
4. To prevent pressure on the cervical spinal nerves, the sling should distribute the supported weight over a large area and not on the back of the neck.
5. Encouraging the patient to remove the arm from the sling and elevate it frequently.
6.Prevent circulatory problems(volkmans contractures)through frequent neurovascular checks

\section*{2. Leg casts}

\section*{Nursing interventions}
- Supporting the patient's leg on pillows to heart level to control swelling and applies ice packs as prescribed over the fracture site for 1 or 2 days.
- Teaching the patient to elevate the casted leg when seated.
- The patient should also assume a recumbent position several times a day with the casted leg elevated to promote venous return \& control swelling.
- Assessing circulation by observing the color, temperature, and capillary refill of the exposed toes.
- Nerve function is assessed by observing the patient's ability to move the toes and by asking about the sensations in the foot. Numbness, tingling, and burning may be caused by peroneal nerve injury from pressure at the head of the fibula.
- When the cast is hard and dry, the nurse teaches the patient how to transfer and ambulate safely with assistive devices (eg, crutches, walker).
- If weight bearing is allowed, the cast is reinforced to withstand the body weight.

\section*{3. Body or spica casts}
- Casts that encase the trunk (body cast) and portions of one or two extremities (spica cast) require special nursing strategies.

\section*{Nursing interventions}
$\checkmark$ Preparing and positioning the patient, assisting with skin care and hygiene, and monitoring for cast syndrome.
$\checkmark$ Explaining the procedure helps reduce the patient's apprehension about being encased in a large cast.
$\checkmark$ Reassuring the patient that several people will provide care during the application.
$\checkmark$ Medications for pain relief and relaxation administered before the procedure enable the patient to cooperate during application of the cast.
$\checkmark$ The pillows are positioned next to each other, because spaces between pillows allow the damp cast to sag, become weak, and possibly break.
$\checkmark$ A pillow is not placed under the head and shoulders of a patient in a body cast while the cast is drying, because doing so causes pressure on the chest.
$\checkmark$ Turning the patient as a unit toward the uninjured side every 2 hours to relieve pressure and to allow the cast to dry.
$\checkmark$ Avoid twisting the patient's body within the cast.
$\checkmark$ Cracking or denting of the cast is prevented by supporting the patient on a firm mattress and with flexible, waterproof pillows until the cast dries.
Encouraging the patient to assist in the repositioning, if not contraindicated, by use of the trapeze or bed rail.
$\checkmark$ Turning the patient to a prone position, twice daily if tolerated, to provide postural drainage of the bronchial tree and to relieve pressure on the back.
$\checkmark$ Placing a pillow lengthwise under the dorsa of the feet or allowing the toes to hang over the edge of the bed to prevent the toes from being forced into the mattress.
$\checkmark$ Inspecting the skin around the edges of the cast frequently for signs of irritation.
$\checkmark$ The skin can be bathed and massaged by reaching under the cast edges with the fingers.
$\checkmark$ To protect the cast from soiling, the nurse can insert clean dry plastic sheeting under the cast and over the cast edge before elimination by the patient.
$\checkmark$ Teaching the family members how to care for the patient at home on providing hygienic and skin care, ensuring proper positioning, preventing complications, and recognizing symptoms that should be reported to the health care provider.

\section*{Managing a patient with splints and braces}
- Contoured splints of plaster or pliable thermoplastic may be used for conditions
- that do not require rigid immobilization,
- for those in which swelling may be anticipated, and
- for those that require special skin care.
- The splint must be well padded to prevent pressure, skin abrasion, and skin breakdown.
- The splint is overwrapped with an elastic bandage applied in a spiral fashion and with pressure uniformly distributed so that the circulation is not restricted.
- Assessment of the neurovascular status and skin integrity of the splinted extremity should be done frequently.
- For long-term use, braces (orthoses) are used to
- provide support,
- control movement, and
- prevent additional injury.
- Braces may be constructed of plastic materials, canvas, leather, or metal.
- The orthotist adjusts the brace for fit, positioning, and motion.
- The nurse
- helps the patient learn to apply the brace and to protect the skin from irritation and breakdown.
- assesses neurovascular integrity and comfort when the patient is wearing the brace,
- encourages the patient to wear the brace as prescribed, and
- reassures the patient that minor adjustments of the brace by the orthotist will increase comfort and minimize problems associated with its long-term use.

\section*{connellagens of}

\section*{fractures}

\section*{Two categories-early and delayed.}
- Early complications include
- shock,
- fat embolism,
- Compartment syndrome,
- deep vein thrombosis,
- Thrombo-embolism(pulmonary embolism),
- disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, (DIC),
- infection.
- Delayed complications include
- delayed union and nonunion,
- avascular necrosis of bone,
- reaction to internal fixation devices,
- complex regional pain syndrome (formerly called reflex sympathetic dystrophy), and
- heterotrophic ossification.

\section*{Nursing intervention to prevent fracture complications}
1) Preventing trauma and injury/promoting self-care
- Advise the patient on
- Self transfer technique
- Proper use of ambulatory aids
- Proper positioning of the affected extremity
- Pain and discomfort relief measures
2) Maintaining strength and mobility/promoting activity
- Encourage the patient to perform muscle toning exercises on a regular basis
- Encourage and assist the patient ot resume to normal functioning of all ADL within limits of immobilization.
3) Promoting comfort
- Admininister the prescribed antispasmodics
- Reposition the patient frequently with the prescribed position to avoid prolonged pressure over bony prominences
- Apply ice compresses as ordered to the affected part to reduce swelling and relieve pain
4) Maintaining intact neurovascular status and tissue perfusion
- Palpating for warmth and observing for colour in the affected part
- Assessing for presence of positive Homan's sign
- Instituting measures to promote venous blood flow
- Elevate the extremity to a level above the heart
- Use proper positioning techniques
- Avoid external compression on pressure sites
- Encourage ROM and isometric exercises
5) Preventing infection
- Observe aseptic technique during dressing changes to prevent infection
- Monitoring drains for correct placement
- Performing pin site care to prevent infection
- Providing and encouraging the patient to eat a well balanced diet to provide nutritional elements necessary for wound healing.
6)Maintaining skin integrity
- Identifying skin areas at risk especially over bony prominences
- Inspecting the skin for signs of pressure
- Turning the patient 2 hourly while fracture immobilisation using a turning sheet

\section*{Soft tissue injuries}
1. Contusion is a soft tissue injury produced by blunt force, such as a blow, kick, or fall.
- Many small blood vessels rupture and bleed into soft tissues (ecchymosis, or bruising). A hematoma develops when the bleeding is sufficient to cause an appreciable collection of blood.
- Local symptoms (pain, swelling, and discoloration) are controlled with intermittent application of cold. Most contusions resolve in 1 to 2 weeks.
2. A strain is a "muscle pull" caused by overuse, overstretching, or excessive stress. Strains are microscopic, incomplete muscle tears with some bleeding into the tissue.
- The patient experiences soreness or sudden pain, with local tenderness on muscle use and isometric contraction.
3. A sprain is an injury to the ligaments surrounding a joint that is caused by a wrenching or twisting motion.
- The function of a ligament is to maintain stability while permitting mobility. A torn ligament loses its stabilizing ability.
- Blood vessels rupture and edema occurs; the joint is tender, and movement of the joint becomes painful.
- The degree of disability and pain increases during the first 2 to 3 hours after the injury because of the associated swelling and bleeding.
- An x-ray should be obtained to rule out bone injury.
4. Avulsion fracture (in which a bone fragment is pulled away by a ligament or tendon) may be associated with a sprain.
- Treatment of contusions, strains, and sprains consists of
- The acronym RICE-Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation)
- Rest prevents additional injury and promotes healing.
- Moist or dry cold applied intermittently for 20 to 30 minutes during the first 24 to 48 hours after injury produces vasoconstriction, which decreases bleeding, edema, and discomfort. Care must be taken to avoid skin and tissue damage from excessive cold.
- An elastic compression bandage controls bleeding, reduces edema, and provides support for the injured tissues.
- Elevation controls the swelling.
- If the sprain is severe, surgical repair or cast immobilization may be necessary so that the joint will not lose its stability. The neurovascular status (circulation, motion, sensation) of the injured extremity is monitored frequently.

\section*{JOINT DISORDERS RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS \\ Rheumatoid Arthritis is a systemic inflammatory diseases affecting synovial joints. \\ - Pathophysiology}

The autoimmune reaction within synovial membrane leads to an inflammatory process, that damages or irritates the joint tissues.
- Continued inflammation leads to thickening of the synovium especially where it joins the articular cartilage.
- At this point, fibrin develops into a granulation tissue known as pannus which destroys cartilage and erodes the bones. This leads to adhesions between ioint surfaces and fibrous or

\section*{Diagnosis}
- This is made from the history and presence of :
- Stiffness, joint pain and swelling
- Narrowing of the joint spaces seen on x-ray
- Mild leucocytosis
- Rheumatoid factor

The red blood cell count and CD4 complement component are decreased

\section*{Arthritis Assessment}
- Inspection and palpation of the same joints on both sides of the body for asymmetry, skin color, size, shape, tenderness, swelling
- Limitation of active joint movement

\section*{Medical management}
- Administering of medications e.g. indocid 5075 mg tds, naprosyn 100 mg bd
- Steroids i.e predinsolone reduce inflammation
- Disease modifying anti-rheumatoid drugs i.e methotrexate, sulfasalzine slow progression of disease
- Immunosupressants i.e cyclosporine
- Surgical procedures include synovectomy (excision of the synovial membrane), tenorrhaphy (suturing a tendon), arthrodesis (surgical fusion of the joint), and arthroplasty (surgical repair and replacement of the joint).

\section*{Nursing interventions}
1) Comfort/ Proper positioning of limb
- Providing heat or cold treatments on the affected joints according
- Encouraging the use of resting splints
2) Independence
- Assist in activities of daily living as needed
- Encourage use of supportive devices e.g. trapeze to move up the bed
3) Reducing fatigue by for example, providing frequent rest periods. Instruct patient on how to conserve energy.
4) Mobility and prevention of injury by:
- Assessing all joints for signs of inflammation and deformity
- Avoiding positions that can lead to formation of contractures
- Encouraging patient to wear flat shoes and not slippers for ambulation
5. Nutrition-
- with emphasis on foods high in vitamins, protein, and iron for tissue building and repair. For the extremely anorexic patient, small, frequent feedings

\section*{Degenerative joint disease(osteoarthritis)}

Def: A condition affecting one or more joints characterised by degeneration of joint tissue or a noninflammatory condition of the joint characterised by degeneration of joint tissue.

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- The onset is slow with erosion of articular cartilage, thickening of sub-chondral bone and formation of osteophytes or bone spurs.
- . The area of the cartilage becomes soft and the surface becomes rough and cracks. Eventually the cartilage is destroyed and the underlying bone goes through a remodeling process.
- Osteophytes or bone spurs appear at the joint margin at the sites of attachment. These may break off and appear in the joints as joint mice.

\section*{Classification}
- Primary (idiopathic)...no prior event or disease related to the OA, and
- Secondary....resulting from previous joint injury or inflammatory disease.

\section*{Risk factors}
$\checkmark$ Increased age
$\checkmark$ Obesity
$\checkmark$ Previous joint damage
$\checkmark$ Repetitive use (occupational or recreational)
$\checkmark$ Anatomic deformity
$\checkmark$ Genetic susceptibility

\section*{Clinical Features}
$\checkmark$ Pain in affected joint (due to an inflamed synovium, stretching of the joint capsule or ligaments) which increases with weather changes or increased activity
$\checkmark$ Muscle spasms
$\checkmark$ Stiffness (morning or on awakening)
$\checkmark$ Shortening ligaments
$\checkmark$ Joint deformity
$\checkmark$ Functional impairment(due to pain on movement and limited motion caused by structural changes in the joints.
$\checkmark$ Characteristic bony nodes may be present; on inspection and palpation(usually painless, unless inflammation is present.

\section*{Diagnosis}
- Based on evaluation and history
- X-ray films show narrowing of joint space

\section*{Medical management}

NOTE: no treatment halts the degenerative process, certain preventive measures can slow the progress if undertaken early enough. These include
- weight reduction,
- prevention of injuries,
- perinatal screening for congenital hip disease, and
- ergonomic modifications.
- Conservative treatment measures include the
- use of heat,
- weight reduction,
- joint rest and
> avoidance of joint overuse,
- orthotic devices to support inflamed joints (splints, braces),
- isometric and postural exercises, and aerobic exercise.
- Occupational and physical therapy can help the patient adopt self-management strategies.

\section*{Pharmacologic management}
- Directed toward symptom management and pain control.
- Use of analgesics, opioids and intra-articular corticosteroids.
- Newer therapeutic approaches include glucosamine and chondroitin, which are thought to improve tissue function and retard breakdown of cartilage
- Viscosupplementation, the intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid, is thought to improve cartilage function and retard degradation; it may also have some antiinflammatory effects

\section*{- Surgical management}
- osteotomy (to alter the force distribution in the joint)
- arthroplasty.
- Viscosupplementation (the reconstitution of synovial fluid viscosity).
- Tidal irrigation (lavage) of the knee involves the introduction and then removal of a large volume of saline into the joint through cannulas.

\section*{Post-operative management}
$\checkmark$ Proper positioning of the patient in bed to avoid hip dislocation. A wedge pillow maybe used between the limbs.
$\checkmark$ Vital signs observation four hourly to assess the patient's progress.
$\checkmark$ Oxygen may be administered for the first six hours to improve perfusion.
$\checkmark$ Observations are of the incision site for bleeding and drainage if drain is in situ. If the drainage is minimal the drains should be removed 48 to 72 hours post operatively.
$\checkmark$ Pain management control should be maintained throughout the recovery period e.g. pethidine 75 mg IV eight hourly and as needed followed by oral diclofenac 100 mg bd for $14-21$ days.
$\checkmark$ Ambulation. The patient starts on passive exercises as soon as the pain is controlled to avoid complications e.g. deep venous thrombosis.
$\checkmark$ Nutrition. patients may be allowed to take oral sips six hours after surgery.
-If they had intravenous infusions running, these should be allowed to go through and the input and output chart should be maintained to monitor fluids.
- The patient should be allowed to feed on a well balanced diet soon after they can tolerate fluids.

\section*{Nursing management}
1. Relief of pain by
- resting the involved joints,
- advising the patient to avoid activities that precipitate pain,
- use of heat,
- analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs,
- The use of correct body mechanics and assistive devises
- avoidance of heavy weight bearing is also helpful.
2. Optimizing functional ability
- Canes or other assistive devices for ambulation should be considered.
- Exercises such as walking should be begun in moderation and increased gradually.
- Progressive range of motion exercises, avoiding flexion deformities

\section*{JOINT DISLOCATION}

Def: a condition in which the articular surfaces of the bones forming the joint are no longer in anatomic contact. The bones are literally "out of joint."
- A sub-luxation is a partial dislocation of the articulating surfaces.
- Traumatic dislocations are orthopedic emergencies because the associated joint structures, blood supply, and nerves are distorted and severely stressed.
- If the dislocation is not treated promptly, avascular necrosis (tissue death due to anoxia and diminished blood supply) and nerve palsy may occur.
- Dislocations may be
- congenital, or present at birth (most often the hip);
- spontaneous or pathologic,
- caused by disease of the articular or peri-articular structures;
- traumatic, resulting from injury in which the joint is disrupted by force.
- Signs and symptoms of a traumatic dislocation are
- pain,
- change in contour of the joint,
- change in the length of the extremity,
- loss of normal mobility, and
- change in the axis of the dislocated bones.
- X-rays confirm the diagnosis

\section*{Medical management}
1. Immobilization of the affected joint while the patient is transported to the hospital.
2. Prompt reduction of the dislocation i.e., (displaced parts are brought into normal position) to preserve joint function.
3. Analgesia, muscle relaxants, and possibly anesthesia are used to facilitate closed reduction.
4. The joint is immobilized by bandages, splints, casts, or traction and is maintained in a stable position.
5. Neurovascular status is monitored.
6. After reduction, if the joint is stable, gentle, progressive, active and passive movement is begun to preserve range of motion (ROM) and restore strength.
7. The joint is supported between exercise sessions.

\section*{Nursing management}
- Providing comfort,
- Evaluating the patient's neurovascular status,
- Protecting the joint during healing.
- Teaching the patient how to manage the immobilizing devices and how to protect the joint from re-injury.

\section*{AMPUTATION}

Def: removal of a body part, usually a limb or part of a limb
- Amputation is often necessary as a result of:
- Progressive peripheral vascular disease(often a sequelae of DM)
- Severe burns
-Severe congenital deformities
-malignant tumours
- fulminating gas gangrene,
trauma (crushing injuries, burns, frostbite, electrical burns),
- Chronic osteomyelitis.
- Amputation is used to
- relieve symptoms,
- improve function,
- save or improve the patient's quality of life.

\section*{Levels of amputation}
- Amputation is performed at the most distal point that will heal successfully. The site of amputation is determined by two factors:
- circulation in the part, and
- functional usefulness (i.e., meets the requirements for the use of the prosthesis).
- The circulatory status of the extremity is evaluated through
- physical examination
- Doppler flow-metry,
- Segmental blood pressure determinations, and
- Transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)
- Angiography (if revascularization is considered an option).
- The objective of surgery is to conserve as much extremity length as possible. Preservation of knee and elbow joints is desired.
- Below-knee amputations are preferred to aboveknee amputations because of the importance of the knee joint and the energy requirements for walking.
- Knee disarticulations are most successful with young, active patients who are able to develop precise control of the prosthesis.
- When above-knee amputations are performed, all possible length is preserved, muscles are stabilized and shaped, and hip contractures are prevented for maximum ambulatory potential.
- Most people who have a hip disarticulation amputation must rely on a wheelchair for mobility.
- A staged amputation may be used when gangrene and infection exist

\section*{Pre-operative care}
1. the nurse must evaluate the neurovascular and functional status of the extremity, the circulatory status nutritional status, Any concurrent health problems , cardiac insufficiency, chronic respiratory problems, diabetes mellitus.
2. Assist the patient to undergo investigations and i.e blood grouping and crossmatching
3. provide psychological support that will help to deal with sudden change in body image.
4. Always give good nutrition, high in vitamins and proteins
5. Correct and monitor Hb ,
6. Teach the patient how to use assistive devices such as crutches
7. Involve the patient in exercise programmes.

\section*{Complications}

They include hemorrhage, infection, skin breakdown, phantom limb pain and joint contracture.

\section*{Post-operative care}
- Surgical pain can be effectively controlled with opioid analgesics i.e pethidine
- Immediately after surgery, the patient should be closely monitored for hemorrhages, vital signs fluctuations.
- Ensure good wound drainage as well as proper wound dressing
- Administration of antibiotics to decrease sepsis
- Physiotherapy to prevent the development of contractures.
Phantom pain (when a patient reports pain in an area distal to a point of amputation) often occurs as a result of the missing limb and psychotherapy is recommended. i.e a patient may report pain on missing toes.
- Care of the skin at the stump area,
- help the patient to achieve physical mobility by Muscle strengthening and ROM exercise, position changes, elevation of extremity.
- Enhancing healing by gentle handling of the residual limb, control of residual limb edema through rigid or soft compression dressings, and use of aseptic technique in wound care to avoid infection.
- Education on use of prostheses
- Monitor for potential complicationi 1.e infections
- Rehabilitation of the patient
- psychological support in accepting the sudden change in body image
- The patient is encouraged to be an active participant in self-care.
- dealing with the stresses of hospitalization,
- Modification of lifestyle.

\section*{GOUT}

Def: heterogeneous group of conditions related to a genetic defect of purine metabolism resulting in hyperuricemia and deposition of monosodium urate crystalsuric acid/ in joints or soft tissue causing inflamation.
- In human blood, uric acid concentrations are between 3.6 and $8.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$
Symptoms: joint pain that starts with distal joints and swelling. Acute athritis big toe mostly affected.
- tophi (crystalline deposits accumulating in articular tissue,
- Saturation of uric acid in the human blood stream may result in one form of kidney stones
- Aggravated by infections, cold weather and consumption of meals rich in purines
- The four phases of gout include
1. asymptomatic hyperurecemia (early phase)
2, acute gouty arthritis (acute phase)
3. intercritical gout (remission)
4. chronic tophaceous gout (chronic gout)
- Peak incidence occurs in patients 30 to 50 years.
- Condition more common in men than women.

\section*{Causes of gout}
$\checkmark$ Raised levels of uric acid.
$\checkmark$ High intake of purine rich foods e.g. offal foods, red meat and shell fish.
$\checkmark$ High alcohol intake particularly beer and wine can increase uric acid levels in the body. Heavy alcohol intake is a risk factor that often precedes a gout attack.
$\checkmark$ Genetics- Gout runs in families from one generation to the next. This disapproves the common notion that gout is mainly caused by excessive eating (nyama choma) and drinking.
Obesity- contributory factor to gout.
$\checkmark$ High blood pressure- usually linked to high uric acid levels and also linked to conditions such as heart disease
$\checkmark$ Drugs or medications- e.g. Diuretics, aspirin \& chemotherapy treatment for cancer can lead to increase in uric acid levels

\section*{Management}

Mainly preventive.
- Advice on how to avoid acute gout attacks.
- Anti-gout medication comes in two forms.
- Pain-controlling medication such as indocid, diclofenac and aspirin at a high dose.
- Colechine used in acute attack
- Medication that acts to decrease the production of uric acid e.g. allopurinol, probencid.
- Advice to avoid over indulgence on roast meat, organ meat (such as liver), baked chicken as these are high in purines.
- Drinking lots of fluids to facilitate the secretion of uric acid through the kidneys.

\section*{Wound Management}
- Wound is not closed at initial surgery
- Second look debridement with consideration for coverage after 48-72 hrs
- Limb should not be at risk for further swelling
- Pt should be adequately stabilized
- Usually requires skin graft
- DPC possible if residual swelling is minimal
- Flap coverage needed if nerves, vessels, or bone exposed
- Goal is to obtain definitive coverage within 7-10 days

\section*{Wound Management}
- After the fasciotomy, a bulky compression dressing and a splint are applied.
- "VAC" (Vacuum Assisted Closure) can be used
- Foot should be placed in neutral to prevent equinus contracture.
- Incision for the fasciotomy usually can be closed after three to five days

\section*{Complications Related to \\ Fasciotomies}
- Altered sensation within the margins of the wound (77\%)
- Dry, scaly skin (40\%)
- Pruritus (33\%)
- Discolored wounds (30\%)
- Swollen limbs (25\%)
- Tethered scars (26\%)
- Recurrent ulceration (13\%)
- Muscle herniation (13\%)
- Pain related to the wound (10\%)
- Tethered tendons (7\%)

\section*{Conclusion}

Compartment syndrome is a serious syndrome, Which needs to be diagnosed early.
* Palpable pulse doesn't exclude compartment syndrome
* If diagnosis and fasciotomy were done within 24 hrs , the prognosis is good.
* If delayed, complications will develop.

The earlier you diagnose, the safer you are

\section*{TUBERCULOSIS OF THE BONES}

\section*{AETIOLOGY}
- It is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis
ROUTES OF INFECTION( MODES OF TRANSMISSION)
1. Blood stream(haematogenous)from pulmonary foci
2. Direct extension from a joint or soft tissue
3. Rarely- lymphatic spread from infected lymphnodes

\section*{PATHOLOGY}
- When the bacilli reaches the bone, there a typical tuberculous inflammatory reaction.
- Part of the bone is destroyed and replaced by granulation tissue.
-A tuberculous abscess is commonly formed. It tracks beneath the soft tissues or towards the surface of the body.
$>$ With treatment, there is a tendency to healing by fibrosis.

\section*{SITES}
1) Vertebral column( thoracic \& lumbar vertebrae)
- It's the commonest site
- The infection typically affects the vertebral bodies
- The vertebral bodies collapse anteriorly becoming wedge shaped resulting to Gibbus deformity( exaggerated kyphosis)
- An abscess may track downwards along the vertebral column
- The abscess may extend backward towards the spinal canal causing pressure on the spinal cord which may lead to paraplegia

\section*{Sites cont'd}
2) Hands
- It affects the metacarpals and phalanges causing tuberculous dactylitis
3) Feet
- It affects the metatarsals and phalanges
4) Long bones( femur, tibia, radius \& ulna)
- It causes juxta-articular tuberculosis
- It occurs as an extension of tuberculous arthritis
- The articular ends of the bones are frequently eroded by tuberculosis.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}

It has a gradual( insidious) onset.
1. Constitutional features:

Night sweats
- Fever
- General malaise
- Loss of weight
- Some may have a cough(rare)

\section*{Clinical features cont'd}

\section*{2. Specific features:}

The depend on the site affected:
- Hands and feet- Pain and swelling
- Long bones- pain and stiffness of affected joint
- Vertebrae- Backache, deformities( scoliosis or kyphotic Gibbus deformity)
- Cold abscess as the pus follows the psoas muscle
- Paraplegia and other neurological features

\section*{INVESTIGATIONS}
1) Full haemogram + ESR
- Hb- slightly reduced
- Relative lymphocytosis
- ESR- moderately elevated( 40-
$60 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{hr}$ )
2) Sputum for AAFB
3) Gastric lavage for AAFB

\section*{Investigations cont'd}
4) Radiological investigations:
a. X-ray
- Diffuse rarefaction around the site of infection
- Erosion of the bone(juxta-articular tuberculosis)
- In most cases - shadow in soft tissues denoting abscess formation.
- Wedging of the vertebral bodies
b) MRI- Bone destruction, abscess, spinal cord involvement
c) CT Scan
d) Radioisotope scanning- areas or increased osteoblastic activity( red spots)

\section*{Investigations cont'd}
5) Mantoux test- positive
6) Pus aspirate for culture
7) Biopsy of the bone or soft tissues for histology - features of tuberculosis

\section*{TREATMENT}

\section*{1) Supportive treatment}
- Nutritional support
- Correct the anaemia
- Analgesics
2) Chemotherapy
- Combined anti-Tb therapy for six months. Drugs are combined so a to:
- reduce resistance
- reduce the dosage of individual drugs
- reduce drug complications

\section*{Treatment cont'd}
3) Surgery
- Drainage of the abscess
- Surgical decompression of the spinal cord and stabilization of vertebral column
- Bone curettage and grafting
- Synovectomy
- Arthroplasties

\section*{Treatment cont'd}
4) Rehabilitation
- Physiotherapy
- Use of crutches
- Provision of wheelchairs for paraplegics

\section*{PROGNOSIS}

The outcome of the disease may take three forms:
i. Heal completely
ii. Become a chronic illness
iii. Spread to other organs in form of milliary Tb

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}
a) Permanent bone/joint destruction leading to permanent deformities
b) Paraplegia and other neurological complications
c) Spread to other organ- milliary Tb

\section*{ASSIGNMENTS}
1. Syphilitic bone infection
2. Madurella mycetoma (Madura foot)
