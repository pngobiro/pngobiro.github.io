\section*{TUBERCULOSIS OF THE BONES}

\section*{AETIOLOGY}
- It is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis
ROUTES OF INFECTION( MODES OF TRANSMISSION)
1. Blood stream(haematogenous)from pulmonary foci
2. Direct extension from a joint or soft tissue
3. Rarely- lymphatic spread from infected lymphnodes

\section*{PATHOLOGY}
- When the bacilli reaches the bone, there a typical tuberculous inflammatory reaction.
- Part of the bone is destroyed and replaced by granulation tissue.
-A tuberculous abscess is commonly formed. It tracks beneath the soft tissues or towards the surface of the body.
$>$ With treatment, there is a tendency to healing by fibrosis.

\section*{SITES}
1) Vertebral column( thoracic \& lumbar vertebrae)
- It's the commonest site
- The infection typically affects the vertebral bodies
- The vertebral bodies collapse anteriorly becoming wedge shaped resulting to Gibbus deformity( exaggerated kyphosis)
- An abscess may track downwards along the vertebral column
- The abscess may extend backward towards the spinal canal causing pressure on the spinal cord which may lead to paraplegia

\section*{Sites cont'd}
2) Hands
- It affects the metacarpals and phalanges causing tuberculous dactylitis
3) Feet
- It affects the metatarsals and phalanges
4) Long bones( femur, tibia, radius \& ulna)
- It causes juxta-articular tuberculosis
- It occurs as an extension of tuberculous arthritis
- The articular ends of the bones are frequently eroded by tuberculosis.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}

It has a gradual( insidious) onset.
1. Constitutional features:

Night sweats
- Fever
- General malaise
- Loss of weight
- Some may have a cough(rare)

\section*{Clinical features cont'd}

\section*{2. Specific features:}

The depend on the site affected:
- Hands and feet- Pain and swelling
- Long bones- pain and stiffness of affected joint
- Vertebrae- Backache, deformities( scoliosis or kyphotic Gibbus deformity)
- Cold abscess as the pus follows the psoas muscle
- Paraplegia and other neurological features

\section*{INVESTIGATIONS}
1) Full haemogram + ESR
- Hb- slightly reduced
- Relative lymphocytosis
- ESR- moderately elevated( 40-
$60 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{hr}$ )
2) Sputum for AAFB
3) Gastric lavage for AAFB

\section*{Investigations cont'd}
4) Radiological investigations:
a. X-ray
- Diffuse rarefaction around the site of infection
- Erosion of the bone(juxta-articular tuberculosis)
- In most cases - shadow in soft tissues denoting abscess formation.
- Wedging of the vertebral bodies
b) MRI- Bone destruction, abscess, spinal cord involvement
c) CT Scan
d) Radioisotope scanning- areas or increased osteoblastic activity( red spots)

\section*{Investigations cont'd}
5) Mantoux test- positive
6) Pus aspirate for culture
7) Biopsy of the bone or soft tissues for histology - features of tuberculosis

\section*{TREATMENT}

\section*{1) Supportive treatment}
- Nutritional support
- Correct the anaemia
- Analgesics
2) Chemotherapy
- Combined anti-Tb therapy for six months. Drugs are combined so a to:
- reduce resistance
- reduce the dosage of individual drugs
- reduce drug complications

\section*{Treatment cont'd}
3) Surgery
- Drainage of the abscess
- Surgical decompression of the spinal cord and stabilization of vertebral column
- Bone curettage and grafting
- Synovectomy
- Arthroplasties

\section*{Treatment cont'd}
4) Rehabilitation
- Physiotherapy
- Use of crutches
- Provision of wheelchairs for paraplegics

\section*{PROGNOSIS}

The outcome of the disease may take three forms:
i. Heal completely
ii. Become a chronic illness
iii. Spread to other organs in form of milliary Tb

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}
a) Permanent bone/joint destruction leading to permanent deformities
b) Paraplegia and other neurological complications
c) Spread to other organ- milliary Tb

\section*{ASSIGNMENTS}
1. Syphilitic bone infection
2. Madurella mycetoma (Madura foot)
