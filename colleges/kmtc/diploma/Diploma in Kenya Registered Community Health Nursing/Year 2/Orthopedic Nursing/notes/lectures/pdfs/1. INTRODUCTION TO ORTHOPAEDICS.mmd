INTRODUCTION \\ TO \\ ORTHOPAEDICS
}

PRESENTED BY:
PROF. J.A.O. MULIMBA

\section*{2. Introduction: What is Orthopaedics.}
- This is the study of the locomotor system.
- Historically was derived from Greek meaning straight child.
- Term coined by Andre in 1741.

\section*{3. The scope of locomotor system:}
- Bones
- Joints
- Muscles and Tendons
- Ligaments
- Bursae
- Nerves
- Blood Vessels.

\section*{4. Have Orthopaedic and Orthopaedic Trauma}
- Orthopaedics: Derangements of the locomotor system.
- Orthopaedic Trauma: Injury of the locomotor system.

\section*{5. Scope of orthopaedics:}
- Congenital disorders.
- Developmental disorders
- Genetic disorders- e.g Blood, storage disorder.
- Inflammatory - infective -e.g. Osteomyelitis.
- None infective - e.g. Rheumatoid Arthritis
- Degenerative disorders - e.g. Osteoarthritis.
- Tumours - e.g.. Osteosarcoma
- Osteoclastoma.
- Miscellaneous - Osteoporosis etc.

\section*{6.Scope of Orthopaedic Trauma:}
- Fractures - excluding skull and chest
- Dislocations
- Subluxations.
- Muscle and tendon injuries.
- Ligamentous injuries.
- Nerve injuries
- Blood vessels
- Cartilage
- Meniscii
7. In the time of Andre, Orthopaedics was primitive but has now become more sophisticated as a result of:
- Development of Anesthesia.
- Development of Asepsis.
- Development of imaging, especially X-rays and other investigation procedures such as - ultrasound, magnetism, radioisotopes; etc.
- Metallurgy and other implants.
- Plasters and other casting materials.
- Laboratory.
8.To understand the locomotor system some of the subjects to be studied include:
- Embryology.
- Anatomy.
- Biochemistry especially bone metabolism.
- Tissue healing i.e. bone, wound.
- Basic biomechanics.
- Implant materials.

\section*{9. Management of Orthopaedic problems is methodical:}
- History
- Examination.
- Investigations
- Treatment
- Rehabilitation

\section*{10. Treatment is broadly divided into} two:
- Conservative - none operative.
- Operative -

Requires: Technical know how.
Instruments.
Implants.
Appropriate theatres -
Sepsis is a curse!

\section*{11. There is much collaboration with other specialists namely:}
- Radiology
- Pathology
- Radiotherapy
- Plastic surgery
- Engineering.
- Nursing.
- Physiotherapy.
- Occupational therapy.

\section*{12.Specialities in Orthopaedics:}
- General.
- Spinal
- Arthroplasty.
- Arthroscopy.
- Hand
- Foot.
- Paediatric
- Sports.

\section*{13.Orthopaedic teaching at University of Nairobi.}
$\square$ In $3^{\text {rd }}$ and $5^{\text {th }}$ year
- University examinations to be given both years.

\section*{Methods of treatment in orthopaedics and trauma}
- Two main divisions

Conservative Management
Physiotherapy - Exercises; manipulations
- Special devices e.g - springs
- Ice
- Heat
- Static bicycles
- Ice
- Heat
- Electrotherapy
- Short wave diathermy
- Encourage muscles to work with faradic stimulation

\section*{Special devices}
- Walking frames
- Crutches
- Walking sticks
- Braces e.g - knee
- wrist
- Armslings
- Monkey chains
- Cervical collars

\section*{Occupational therapy}
- Rehabilitation with methods relevant to work and profession.
- Include kitchen, bath and lavatory
- Printing/Typing
- Woodworking
- Special gadgets for working the hands e.g special cutlery
Chiropractors/Osteopaths
- Not sure where they fit in but do some form of physiotherapy
- Not many in Kenya

\section*{Orthopaedic technologists}

Prepare all sorts of appliances.
- Crutches
- Frames
- Braces
- Splints e.g footdrop splints
- Orthoses
- Prostheses
- Collars
- Special footwear

\section*{Social Services}

Paraplegics
Old folk
Resettlement - change of profession.
Drugs.
NSAID
Steroids
Antibiotics
Anticoagulants $\quad$\begin{tabular}{l}
$-\quad-\quad$ parenteral \\
$-\quad$ oral \\
injectable
\end{tabular}

\section*{others}
e.g
- Allopurinol
- Colchicine
- Tetanus toxoid

\section*{Operative}

Operation can be done on all locomotor tissues as follows:-
Muscles: Generally muscles are not amenable to repair.

\section*{Tendons:}

Tenotomy - division of a tendon
Elongation -e.g ETA
Transposition - Transfer
Release - tenolysis e.g in De Quervains syndrome
Tenodesis - Fixation to bone
Repair - When cut or ruptured. Have special methods

\section*{Bones}

Osteotomy - Breakage or cutting of bones to change their shape. e.g in Blounts disease
Osteosynthesis - This is the repair of bone. Done with screws, plates, nails etc.
- Lengthening various techniques.
- Excision
- Drainage
- Grafting - autograft
- Allografts
- Xenograft
- Bone substitutes e.g chronos.

\section*{Joints}
- Arthrotomy - simply opening a joints.
- Arthroscopy - Looking into a joint with an instrument (arthroscopy)
- Aspiration
- Synovectomy
- Arthrodesis - Fusion of a joint
- Arthrolysis and MUA
- Arthroplasty
- - Excision
- -Hemi arthroplasty
- -Total arthroplasty

\section*{Ligaments}
- Repair
- Replacement e.g ACL
- Plication - e.g Reefing

Nerves.
- Decompression - e.g carpal tunnel syndrome
- Repair
- Neurolysis
- Grafting

Skin
- Repair
- Graft
- Flaps - done by plastic surgeons

After all operations, there is post operative care.

\section*{These include:}

Dressing

\section*{Splintage}

Drugs - Analgesics
- Prophylactic
- Sedatives
- Curative
- Armslings
- Special mobilisation regimes.
