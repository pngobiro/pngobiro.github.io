                            <li><strong>Osteoporosis.</strong> This disorder weakens bones and makes them more likely to break. Leading to pathological fractures.</li>
                            <li><strong>Overuse.</strong> Repetitive motion can tire muscles and place more force on bone. This can result in stress fractures. Stress fractures are more common in athletes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Treatment modalities-</strong> some drugs used cause demineralization of the bones</li>

                        <p><strong>Complete fractures</strong> - this involves a break across the entire cross-section of the bone. They are frequently displaced that is removed from the normal position. Examples;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Comminuted fracture - this is the bone fracture which produces several bone fragments.</li>
                            <li>Linear fracture - it is a break that is parallel to the bone's long axis</li>
                            <li>Transverse fracture - it is a break at right angle to the bone's long axis</li>

                        <p>Reduction of a fracture ("setting" the bone) refers to restoration of the fracture fragments to anatomic alignment and rotation.</p>
                        <p>Either closed reduction or open reduction may be used to reduce a fracture</p>
                        <h4>Closed Reduction.</h4>
                        <p>Closed reduction is accomplished by bringing the bone fragments into apposition (i.e, placing the ends in contact) through manipulation and manual traction.</p>
                        <p>The extremity is held in the desired position, length and alignment while the physician applies a cast, splint, or other device. Reduction under anesthesia.</p>
                        <p>The immobilizing device maintains the reduction and stabilizes the extremity for bone healing.</p>
                        <p>X-rays are obtained to verify that the bone fragments are correctly aligned.</p>
                        <p>Traction (skin or skeletal) may be used to effect fracture reduction and immobilization.</p>
                        <p>Traction-is the application of a pulling force to an injured or diseased part of the body or an extremity while Countertraction pulls in the opposite direction.</p>
                        <p>Two types skin and skeletal traction.</p>

                            <li>To reduce, align, and immobilize fractures</li>
                            <li>To minimize muscle spasms</li>
                            <li>Reduce bone deformity</li>
                            <li>Increase space between opposing forces(for orthopedic procedures)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>NB ; traction is used as a shorter intervention until other treatment modalities are possible</p>

                            <li>Skeletal traction is never interrupted</li>
                            <li>Weights are never removed unless intermittent traction is prescribed</li>
                            <li>Maintain the line of pull</li>
                            <li>The patient must be in good body alignment in the Centre of the bed</li>
                            <li>Ropes must be unobstructed in straight alignment</li>
                            <li>Weights must hang freely and not rest on the bed or floor</li>
                            <li>Knots on the rope must not touch the pulley or the foot of the bed</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Skin traction</strong>- this is traction applied through the skin. Skin traction is generally less desirable due to the fact that skin can be injured when pressure is applied for extended periods of time.
                        It works by applying weight to tape, sponge rubber, or canvas materials which have been attached to the skin surrounding the damaged body structure.</p>

                        <p>Skin traction is used for the control of muscle spasm and to provide immobilization, in theatre during the procedure.</p>
                        <p>If prolonged or heavy traction weight is needed then skeletal traction is usually used rather than skin traction.</p>
                        <p>Traction must be applied in the direction and magnitude to obtain its desired effect. As soft tissue and muscle relax, the amount of weight required may change to maintain the desired pulling force.</p>

                        <h4>Factors to consider when applying skin traction</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Any factor which might reduce the pull or alter the line of pull must be eliminated.</li>
                            <li>Skin should be assessed for abrasions and circulatory problems before the application of skin traction, as it must be in a healthy condition to tolerate the traction.</li>

                        <h4>Types of skin traction</h4>
                        <p><strong>Buck's extension traction</strong>- is a form of traction where pull is exerted in one plane. It is used when partial or temporary immobilization is required, and it is used to provide comfort following injury while awaiting surgical fixation, especially in hip and femur injuries. To apply Buck's traction, foam rubber padded straps are placed with the foam surface against the skin on each side of the affected leg. A loop of tape is extended beyond the sole of the foot, and a spreader is applied to the distal end of the tape which prevents pressure along the side of the foot. The malleolus and proximal fibula are protected with cast padding; this prevents pressure sores and skin necrosis</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensure that traction is effective</li>
                            <li>Maintain counter-traction</li>
                            <li>Avoid wrinkling and slipping of the traction bandage</li>
                            <li>Ensure proper positioning of patient i.e. with good body alignment in the middle of the bed, must be maintained to keep the affected limb in a neutral position.</li>
                            <li>Reassure the patient to alleviate anxiety.</li>
                            <li>Nursing assessment- The body part placed on traction should be assessed for color, temperature, edema, pulse, sensation, movability and skin integrity.</li>

                        <p><strong>Skeletal traction</strong>- is applied by use of metal pins, wires, or screws that inserted through the bone distal to the fracture. This allows for longer traction time and heavier weights (7-12 kgs) to aid in bone realignment.</p>
                        <h5>Indications Skeletal Traction</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Adults requiring > 5kg traction</li>

                        <h4>Types of skeletal tractions</h4>
                        <p><strong>Halo traction:</strong> To stabilize fractures or displaced vertebrae in cervical and thoracic areas. This is usually always used in adults with broken necks if surgery is not performed immediately post injury.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-55-1.jpg" alt="Photograph of a patient wearing a halo traction device for a cervical spine injury." class="content-image">
                        <p>a)<strong>Balanced suspension traction</strong>- suspends and immobilizes a leg without applying traction to the body. May be applied to hip, tibia, fibula or femur. The leg is supported by a Pearson attachment and a Thomas splint. A Thomas splint is a padded ring that fits around the upper leg while the Pearson attachment meets the Thomas splint at the knee and supports the lower leg. A canvas sling may be used to further support the lower leg. Balanced suspension traction is used to stabilize fractures of the femur and requires an invasive procedure in which pins, screws or wires are surgically installed. Weights used in skeletal traction generally range from 25-40lbs (11-18kg)</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_11_379b130de3db04c47379g-57-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of balanced skeletal traction using (A) Thomas leg splint and Pearson attachment, and (B) slings for support and suspension." class="content-image">
                        <p><strong>Femoral traction 90/90</strong>- most commonly used traction for complicated fractures of the femur. A pin or wire is applied through the distal femur; the lower leg may be casted. The thigh is suspended in the vertical plane by weight traction pulling vertically upwards. The ill effect of gravity as the cause of backward angulation of the fragments is thus eliminated. Most effective in children older than 6 yea</p>

                        <p><strong>Spinal decompression traction</strong>- Spinal traction as a means of spinal decompression is often applied without directly touching bones as other methods of traction do. This is sometimes isolated inside-out by inflatable girdles or use of the transversus abdominis muscle</p>

                        <p>E.g. Rib fractures are associated with life threatening pneumothorax or with spleen, liver injuries.</p>
                        <p>E.g. Pelvic injuries are associated with bladder or urethral rupture and cause sever hematoma in the retroperitoneum .</p>
                        <p>Surgery of visceral injuries should take precedence over the treatment of fracture.</p>

                        <p>Muscles are arranged in different compartments and surrounded by one fascia , this arrangement called osteofascial compartment.</p>
                        <p>Compartment syndrome occurs when muscle swells within osteofacial compartment and occludes its blood supply >> infarction and late ischemic contracture.</p>
                        <p>Trauma is the most common cause. Reasons that lead to increase the pressure inside:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Bleeding</li>
                            <li>Edema</li>

                            <li>Fracture of the arm and leg can give rise to severe ischemia even if there is no damage to major vessel.</li>
                            <li>Bleeding or edema will increase the pressure within one of the osteofascial compartments, this lead to decrease in capillary blood flow which in turn leads to muscle ischemia, further edema, still greater pressure, and yet more profound ischemia....vicious circle.</li>
                            <li>After 12 hours or less, this vicious circle ends in necrosis of nerves and muscles within the compartment.</li>
                            <li>Nerves are capable of regeneration, but the muscle once infarcted can never recover and are replaced by fibrous tissue. This condition is called volkmann's ischemic contracture.</li>
