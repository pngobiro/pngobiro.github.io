\section*{Musculoskeletal pain syndrome}
- Poorly localized pain in the extremities that is excessively dysproportionate to the lab and physical findings
- May develop in children with underlying rheumatic disease or post-trauma
- It is associated with sleep disorders, chronic fatigue and poor school attendance, depression with normal

\section*{Musculoskeletal pain syndrome}
- The diagnosis is to exclude other diseases via various tests depending on the presentation
- Treatment involves getting to the bottom of the underlying psychiatric disorder , behavioral therapy, exercise and judicious analgesia

\section*{Clinical manifestations}
- History of pain but no tenderness on clinical exam
- Inconsistency of the details
- Pain varies from place to place
- Poor response to NSAIDs and other analgesics
- Fatigue, sleep disorders poor school attendance
- Depressed moods
- Laboratory findings non specific

\section*{Diagnosis and Treatment}
- Is a diagnosis of exclusion depending on presentation
- Treatment involves identification of underlying psychiatric or psychological problem
- Emotional support, fitness program, anti depressants

\section*{Fibromyalgia}
- Is an MSPS with multiple discrete tender points and sleep disturbance.
- Affects children and adolescents
- Pain affected by activity, anxiety, stress and weather
- The feature is widespread musculoskeletal pain with multiple tender points and other features- fatigue, arthralgia, joint stiffness, skin tenderness,

\section*{Fibromyalgia}
- Post-exertional pains , irritable bowel, poor memory, tension headaches, dizziness, restless legs, fluid retention, Raynauds, paraesthesia,
- It affects quality of life and performance of given tasks
- It is thought that the pain results from changes to the central nervous system

\section*{Fibromyalgia}
- The neurochemical pathology causes the body to become sensitised so that pain is experienced even on mild touch or pressure
- This pain is affected by the psychiatric/ psychological state of the patient
- This condition grouped together with other Central sensitivity syndromes (CSS) like migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, restless leg syndrome, primary dysmenorrhea etc

\section*{Fibromyalgia}
- Pain at well defined tender points on thumb point palpation - occiput, low cervical , trapezius, supraspinatus, $2^{\text {nd }}$ rib, lat epicondyle of humerus, gluteal, greater trochanter, knee,
- On palpation there is pain but features of inflammation eg heat, swelling and redness absent

\section*{Fibromyalgia}
- All lab and imaging tests are normal
- The treatment approach is multidisciplinary
- Goals: reduce pain and depression and improve sleep and physical activity
- Pharmacological approach: include muscle relaxants, tricyclic anti depressants, SSRIs, usually in combination with NSAIDs and non

\section*{Fibromyalgia}
- Exercise/activity/ physiotherapy nonimpact aerobic activity improves fitness and CVS health
- Psychotherapy - reduces levels of anxiety and depression and improves well being
- Patient support- child and family support is important
- Others-hypnotherapy , TENS

\section*{Complex regional pain syndrome (reflex sympathetic dystrophy) (CRPS)}
- A condition of unknown cause characterised by diffuse limb pain with colour and temperature changes resulting from autonomic nervous dysfunction
- CRPS type I require causation by an initiating noxious event eg crush, soft tissue injury or tight cast
- CRPS type II is characterised by presence of a defined nerve injury

\section*{CRPS}
- In both cases there is pain, allodynia or hyperalgesia that is dysproportionate to the initiating event
- In the course of the syndrome there is edema, skin blood flow changes revealed by colour changes and skin temperature changes of >1.1 degrees celcius from homologous part of the body

\section*{CRPS}
- Thought to result from persistence of noxious stimuli from an injured part leading to peripheral and central sensitisation.
- Primary afferent nociceptive mechanisms demonstrate abnormally heightened sensation with spontaneous pain and hyperalgesia

\section*{CRPS}
- No diagnostic tests identify CRPS
- Type I symptoms often begin immediately -weeks after an injury usually in a distal extremity. Usually one limb involved but rarely multiple
- They have spontaneous pain, difficulty in using affected limb, neglect-like symptoms, altered skin temperature, rapid fatiguability

\section*{CRPS}
- Physical exams - impaired motor functions, limited range of movement, dystonia, musclespasms, hypoesthesia, allodynia, anesthesia dolorosa, abnormal sweating, edema, altered skin colour and temperature, atrophy, hypotrichosis and altered nail growth

\section*{CRPS}
- Blood tests usually normal
- EMG and NCS may reveal presence of nerve injury, CRPS II, or rule out other DDx
- Vascular studies considered
- Muscle and nerve biopsies may show decrease in type 1 fibres, increased lipofucsin, fibre atrophy, abnormal afferent nerve fibres

\section*{CRPS}
- Pharmacological treatment:
- Corticosteroids[ beneficial in short term but not so useful in chronic management
- Calcium regulating drugs: calcitonin, clodronate and aledronate have reduced pain, swelling, movement
- Opioids: role not clear but usually prescribed
- NSAIDs; not been investigated for it but may be used in mild pain

\section*{CRPS}
- Sodium channel blockers: IV lignocaine effective in CRPS; mexiletine has shown benefit in some cases
- GABA agonists: intrathecal baclofen effective for CRPS
- Others : gabapentin, CCBs, beta blockers,clonidine oral sympathlytics
- Interventional procedures: LA injections, regional blocks, surgical sympathectomy

\section*{Erythromelagia}
- A condition characterised by burning pain, warmth and redness of extremities
- Pathophysiology may be associated with thrombocythemia with arteriolar fibrosis/occlussion by platelet thrombi
- Secondary erythromelagia can occur after infections, medications, MPDs, mushroom poisoning

\section*{Erythromelagia}
- Begins with an itch which progresses to more severe burning pain
- The classical triad is redness, pain and warmth in the extremities brought by warming or dependency and relieved by cooling
- Episodes may last from minutes to days and may also involve ears, face, genitals
- During episodes the affected extremity is warm, tender, appears dusky red or mottled

\section*{Erythromelagia}
- periphera;I pulses may be bounding with acrocyanosis.
- Rarely may progress to necrosis of digits, ischemic ulcers with secondary infection
- Check for splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy as secondary erythromelagia associated with MPD may occur.

\section*{Erythromelagia}
- CBC important to detect MPD
- Imaging studies are non-specific
- Thermography reveals elevated skin temparature of affected areas
- Skin biopsy useful

\section*{Erythromelagia}
- Cool and elevate the limb
- Pharmacology ; many therapies triedaspirin, sodium channel blockers, CCBs, TCA, SSRI, gabapentin, anti histamines, immunosuppresants
