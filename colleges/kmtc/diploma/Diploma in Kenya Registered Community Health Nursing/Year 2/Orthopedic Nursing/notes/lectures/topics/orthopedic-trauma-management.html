                            <li>polytrauma(Multiple trauma) is caused by a single catastrophic event that causes life-threatening injuries to at least two distinct organs or organ systems.</li>
                            <li>Patients with single-system trauma still receive full assessment, because even single-system injuries can be life-threatening or more severe than they initially appear.</li>
                            <li>Mortality in patients with multiple trauma is related to the severity of the injuries and the number of systems and organs involved.</li>
                            <li>Immediately after injury, the body is hypermetabolic, hypercoagulable, and severely stressed.</li>
                            <li>Care of the patient with multiple injuries requires a team approach, with one person responsible for coordinating the treatment.</li>
                            <li>The nursing staff assumes responsibility of:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>assessing and monitoring the patient, ensuring airway and IV access,</li>
                                    <li>administering prescribed medications,</li>
                                    <li>collecting laboratory specimens, and</li>
                                    <li>documenting activities and the patient's subsequent responses.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Evidence of trauma may be sparse or absent.</li>
                            <li>Patients with multiple trauma should be assumed to have a spinal cord injury until it is proven otherwise.</li>
                            <li>The injury regarded as the least significant in appearance may be the most lethal.</li>
                            <li>For example, the pelvic fracture not identified until an x-ray is obtained may cause rapid and massive hemorrhage into the pelvic cavity, but an obvious amputation of the arm may have already stopped bleeding from the body's normal response of vasoconstriction.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The patient is observed for the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hypovolemic shock resulting from extravasation of blood and plasma into injured tissues after compression has been released</li>
                            <li>Paralysis of a body part</li>
                            <li>Erythema and blistering of skin</li>
                            <li>Damaged body part (usually an extremity) appearing swollen, tense, and hard</li>
                            <li>Renal dysfunction (prolonged hypotension causes kidney damage and acute renal insufficiency; myoglobinuria secondary to muscle damage can cause acute tubular necrosis and acute renal failure)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The goals of treatment are to determine the extent of injuries and to establish priorities of treatment.</li>
                            <li>Any injury interfering with a vital physiologic function (e.g., ABC - Airway, Breathing, Circulation) is an immediate threat to life and has the highest priority for immediate treatment.</li>
                            <li>Essential life-saving procedures are performed simultaneously by the emergency team.</li>
                            <li>As soon as the patient is resuscitated, clothes are removed or cut off and a rapid physical assessment is performed.</li>
                            <li>Transfer from field management to the ED must be orderly and controlled, with attention given to the verbal report from emergency medical services.</li>
                            <li>Treatment in a trauma center is appropriate for patients experiencing major trauma.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In conjunction with maintaining the A, B and C, the patient is observed for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>acute renal insufficiency - Injury to the back can cause kidney damage.</li>
                            <li>severe muscular damage - may cause rhabdomyolysis, which signifies a release of myoglobin from ischemic skeletal muscle, resulting in acute tubular necrosis.</li>
                            <li>major soft tissue injuries are splinted promptly to control bleeding and pain.</li>
                            <li>Medications for pain and anxiety are then administered</li>
                            <li>Patient is quickly transported to the operating suite for wound débridement and fracture repair.</li>
                            <li>A hyperbaric oxygen chamber (if available) may be used to hyperoxygenate crushed tissue</li>
                            <li>The serum lactic acid level is monitored; a decrease to less than 2.5 mmol/L is an indication of successful resuscitation</li>
                            <li>Injured extremity is elevated to relieve swelling and pressure.</li>
                            <li>Fasciotomy (ie, surgical incision to the level of the fascia) to restore neurovascular function done if compartment syndrome develops</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Muscle compartment:</strong> A well-defined space in the body that consists of a group of muscles in a particular segment, the muscle compartment is bound by fascia</li>
                            <li><strong>Fasciotomy:</strong> Surgical incision made through the fascia and into a compartment due to increasing pressure. The aim of the procedure is to release pressure to improve peripheral neurovascular status and prevent long term complications.</li>
                            <li><strong>Compartment syndrome:</strong> Increase in pressure of a closed muscle compartment that causes muscle and nerve ischemia.</li>

                        <h4>Non- Invasive procedures</h4>
                        <p>Many Sport-related problems can be successfully treated without surgery, as surgery is rarely the first line of treatment for most patients.</p>
                        <h4>PRICE Therapy</h4>
                        <p>If your injury does not require medical treatment, for example a mild sprain or other minor muscle or ligament damage, you can treat it at home using PRICE therapy. PRICE stands for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Protect</strong> the injured area from further injury, for example, by using a support, or in the case of an ankle injury, wearing shoes that enclose and support your feet, such as lace ups.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rest:</strong> avoid regular exercise and reduce daily physical activity. Using crutches or a walking stick may help if you are unable to put weight on your ankle or knee.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ice:</strong> apply an ice pack to the affected area for 10 to 30 minutes. Do not allow the ice to touch your skin directly as this may cause a cold burn. Before applying ice, wrap it in a wet towel or put a wet towel over the injured area.</li>
                            <li><strong>Compression:</strong> apply pressure (compression) using elastic compression bandages. This may help to limit swelling.</li>
                            <li><strong>Elevation:</strong> keep the injured leg, knee, arm, elbow or wrist raised above the level of the heart as this may also help reduce swelling.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>After 48 hours of PRICE therapy, stop compression and try moving the injured area.</p>
                        <p>If, after this time, your symptoms are worse, get advice from a healthcare professional.</p>

                        <p>It is done as an elective procedure. After amputations, the soft tissues are closed primarily over the bony stump. E.g., above knee, below knee etc.</p>
                        <h4>Open Amputation (Guillotine Operation)</h4>
                        <p>It is done as an emergency procedure. E.g. life threatening infections. After amputations, the wound is left open & not closed.</p>

                        <p>Amputation is performed at the most distal point that will heal successfully. The site of amputation is determined by two factors:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Circulation in the part</li>
                            <li>functional usefulness (i.e., meets the requirements for the use of a prosthesis).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The circulatory status of the extremity is evaluated through physical examination and diagnostic studies.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Doppler flow studies with duplex ultrasound</li>
                            <li>segmental blood pressure determinations</li>
                            <li>transcutaneous PaO2 of the extremity</li>
                            <li>Angiography is performed if revascularization is considered an option.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>NB:Muscle and skin perfusion is important for healing.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The objective of surgery is to conserve as much extremity length as needed to preserve function and possibly to achieve a good prosthetic fit. Preservation of knee and elbow joints is desirable.</li>
                            <li>Most amputations involving extremities can be eventually fitted with a prosthesis.</li>
                            <li>The amputation of toes and portions of the foot can cause changes in gait and balance.</li>

                            <li>Below-knee amputation (BKA) is preferred to above-knee amputation (AKA) because of the importance of the knee joint and the energy requirements for walking.</li>

                            <li>Before surgery, the nurse must evaluate the neurovascular and functional status of the extremity through history and physical assessment.</li>
                            <li>If the patient has experienced a traumatic amputation, the nurse assesses the function and condition of the residual limb.</li>
                            <li>The nurse also assesses the circulatory status and function of the unaffected extremity.</li>
                            <li>If infection or gangrene develops, the patient may have associated enlarged lymph nodes, fever, and purulent drainage.</li>
                            <li>A culture and sensitivity test is obtained to determine the appropriate antibiotic therapy.</li>
                            <li>The nurse evaluates the patient's nutritional status and develops a plan for nutritional care in consultation with a dietitian or metabolic support team, if indicated.</li>
                            <li>A diet with adequate protein and vitamins is essential to promote wound healing.</li>
                            <li>Any concurrent health problems (eg, dehydration, anemia, cardiac insufficiency, chronic respiratory problems, diabetes mellitus) need to be identified and treated so that the patient is in the best possible condition to withstand the surgical procedure.</li>
                            <li>The use of corticosteroids, anticoagulants, vasoconstrictors, or vasodilators may influence management and prolong or delay wound healing.</li>

                        <h4>Relieving Pain</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pain may be incisional or may be caused by inflammation, infection, pressure on a bony prominence, or hematoma.</li>
                            <li>Muscle spasms may add to the patient's discomfort.</li>
                            <li>Surgical pain can be effectively controlled with opioid analgesics that may be accompanied with evacuation of a hematoma or accumulated fluid.</li>
                            <li>Changing the patient's position or placing a light sandbag on the residual limb to counteract the muscle spasm may improve the patient's level of comfort.</li>
                            <li>Evaluation of the patient's pain and responses to interventions is an important component of pain management.</li>
                            <li>The pain may be an expression of grief and alteration of body image.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Minimizing Altered Sensory Perceptions</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A person who has had an amputation may begin to experience phantom limb pain soon after surgery or 2 to 3 months after amputation.</li>
                            <li>It occurs more frequently in patients who have had AKAs.</li>
                            <li>The patient describes pain or unusual sensations, such as numbness, tingling, or muscle cramps, as well as a feeling that the extremity is present, crushed, cramped, or twisted in an abnormal position.</li>
                            <li>When a patient describes phantom pains or sensations, the nurse acknowledges these feelings as real and encourages the patient to verbalize when in pain so that effective treatment may be given.</li>
                            <li>Although phantom sensations diminish over time for many patients, they do not occur in all patients with amputations</li>
                            <li>The pathogenesis of the phantom limb phenomenon is unknown.</li>
                            <li>Keeping the patient active helps decrease the occurrence of phantom limb pain.</li>
                            <li>Early intensive rehabilitation and residual limb desensitization with kneading massage bring relief.</li>
                            <li>Distraction techniques and activity are helpful.</li>
                            <li>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), ultrasound, or</li>
                            <li>Local anesthetics may provide relief for some patients.</li>
                            <li>Beta-blockers may relieve dull, burning discomfort;</li>
                            <li>Antiseizure medications control stabbing and cramping pain; and</li>
                            <li>Tricyclic antidepressants may not only alleviate phantom pain, they may also be prescribed to improve mood and coping ability.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Promoting Wound Healing</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The residual limb must be handled gently.</li>
                            <li>Whenever the dressing is changed, aseptic technique is required to prevent wound infection and possible osteomyelitis</li>
                            <li>Residual limb shaping is</li>
                            <li>The nurse instructs the patient and family to apply elastic wraps on the residual limb.</li>
                            <li>Using ace wraps on the residual limb is discouraged because they may apply inconsistent pressure on the residual limb, causing problems with shaping it to fit a prosthetic.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Enhancing Body Image</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Amputation is a procedure that alters the patient's body image.</li>
                            <li>The nurse who has established a trusting relationship with the patient is better able to communicate acceptance of the patient who has experienced an amputation.</li>
                            <li>The nurse encourages the patient to look at, feel, and care for the</li>
                            <li>It is important to identify the patient's strengths and resources to facilitate rehabilitation.</li>
                            <li>The nurse helps the patient regain the previous level of independent functioning.</li>
                            <li>The patient who is accepted as a whole person is more readily able to resume responsibility for self-care; self-concept improves, and body-image changes are accepted.</li>
                            <li>Even with highly motivated patients, this process may take months.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Helping the Patient to Resolve Grieving</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The loss of an extremity (or part of one) may come as a shock even if the patient was prepared preoperatively.</li>
                            <li>The patient's behavior (eg, crying, withdrawal, apathy, anger) and expressed feelings (eg, depression, fear, helplessness) reveal how the patient is coping with the loss and working through the grieving process.</li>
                            <li>The nurse creates an accepting and supportive atmosphere in which the patient and family are encouraged to express and share their feelings and work through the grief process.</li>
                            <li>The support from family and friends promotes the patient's acceptance of the loss.</li>
                            <li>The nurse helps the patient deal with immediate needs and become oriented to realistic rehabilitation goals and future independent functioning.</li>
                            <li>Mental health and support group referrals may be appropriate</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Promoting Independent Self-Care</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Amputation of an extremity affects the patient's ability to provide adequate self-care.</li>
                            <li>The patient is encouraged to be an active participant in self-care.</li>
                            <li>The patient needs time to accomplish these tasks and must not be rushed.</li>
                            <li>Practicing an activity with consistent, supportive supervision in a relaxed environment enables the patient to learn self-care skills.</li>
                            <li>The patient and the nurse need to maintain positive attitudes and to minimize fatigue and frustration during the learning process.</li>
                            <li>Independence in dressing, toileting, and bathing depends on balance, transfer abilities, and physiologic tolerance of the activities.</li>
                            <li>The nurse works with the physical therapist and occupational therapist to teach and supervise the patient in these self-care activities.</li>
                            <li>The patient with an upper extremity amputation has self-care deficits in feeding, bathing, and dressing.</li>
                            <li>Assistance is provided only as needed; the nurse encourages the patient to learn to do these tasks, using assistive feeding and dressing aids when needed.</li>
                            <li>The nurse, therapists, and prosthetist work with the patient to achieve maximum independence.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Helping the Patient to Achieve Physical Mobility</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Proper positioning prevents the development of hip or knee joint contracture in the patient with a lower extremity amputation.</li>
                            <li>Abduction, external rotation, and flexion of the lower extremity are avoided.</li>
                            <li>The residual limb may be placed in an extended position or elevated for a brief period after surgery.</li>
                            <li>The nurse encourages the patient to turn from side to side and to assume a prone position, if possible, to stretch the flexor muscles and to prevent flexion contracture of the hip.</li>
                            <li>The patient is encouraged not to sit for long periods of time to prevent flexion contracture.</li>
                            <li>The legs should remain close together to prevent an abduction deformity.</li>
                            <li>The nurse encourages the patient to use assistive devices to more readily perform self-care activities and to identify what home modifications, if any, should be made to perform these</li>
                            <li>Postoperative ROM exercises are started early because contracture deformities develop rapidly. ROM exercises include hip and knee exercises for patients with BKAs and hip exercises for patients with AKAs.</li>
                            <li>It is important that the patient understand the importance of</li>
