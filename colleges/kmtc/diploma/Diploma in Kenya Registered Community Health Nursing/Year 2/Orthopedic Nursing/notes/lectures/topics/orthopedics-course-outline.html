                        <p>A tumour causes normal bone tissue to react by osteolytic response (bone destruction) or osteoblastic response (bone formation). Primary tumours cause bone destruction, which weakens the bone, resulting in bone fractures. The bones surface changes & the contour enlarges in the tumor area. Malignant bone tumors spreads in blood along the walls of the veins. This invade & destroy adjacent bone tissue & benign bone tumors place pressure on adjacent bone tissue. This weakens the structure of the bone until it can no longer withstand the stress of ordinary use. Pathologic fractures commonly result.</p>

                            <li><strong>Tuberculin test:</strong> precise intracutaneous injection producing a raised, blanched wheal. The reaction is read in 48-72 hrs, a positive test defined as greater than 10 mm of induration.</li>
