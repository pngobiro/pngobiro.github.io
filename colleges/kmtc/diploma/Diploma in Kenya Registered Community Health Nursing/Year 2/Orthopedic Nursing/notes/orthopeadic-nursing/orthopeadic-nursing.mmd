\section*{Definition}

Orthopeadics is a branch of medicine that deals with prevention or correction of disorders involving locomotor structures of the body e.g. the skeleton, joints, muscles, fascia and other supporting structure such as ligaments and cartilage.

\section*{Functions of bones}
- Provision of the framework of the body
- Giving attachment to muscles and tendons
- Allowing movement of the body as a whole and of parts of the body, by forming joints that are moved by muscles
- Forming the boundaries of the cranial, thoracic and pelvic cavities, protecting the organs they contain
- Haemopoiesis , the production of blood cell in red bone marrow.
- Mineral storage

The conditions include-;

\section*{1. FRACTURES}

A fracture is a disruption of the normal bone continuity that occurs when more stress is placed on a bone that it is able to absorb. Surrounding soft tissue injury often occurs.

\section*{Classification}

They can be classified according to

\section*{1. FRACTURE PATTERN}

\section*{Closed (simple) fracture}

It is an uncomplicated fracture with intact skin over the fracture site, that is, bone does not protrude through the skin.

\section*{Open (compound) fracture}

A break in the skin is present over the fracture site. The wound communicates with the skin and fractured bone. This is prone to infection. These fractures may be divided further according to severity.

Grade I-skin puncture with minimal tissue damage
Grade II - as in grade I with skin and muscle contusion
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-03.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}

Grade III- a wound larger than $6-8 \mathrm{~cm}$ with damage to blood vessels, nerves, muscles and skin

\section*{Complete fracture}

The fracture line extends through the bone substance, i.e. the periosteum is disrupted on both side of the bone. All compound fractures are usually complete

\section*{Incomplete (partial fracture).}

Fracture line extends part way through the bone i.e. continuity is not completely disrupted. This is also known as a willow, green stick or hickory stick fracture.

\section*{Displaced fracture}

Bone fragments are separated at the fracture line

\section*{Comminuted fracture}

More than 1 fracture line and bone fragments are crushed or broken into several pieces.

\section*{Impacted fracture (telescoped) or compression fracture}

One bone fragment is forcibly driven into another adjacent bone fragment.

\section*{Pathologic fracture}

It occurs as a result of underlying bone disorder such as osteoporosis or tumor. Usually occurs with minimal trauma

\section*{Green stick fracture}

One side of the bone is broken and the other side is bent.
A fracture in which a fragment of bone has been pulled away by a ligament or tendon and its attachment.
NB A fracture may combine many of the above patterns e.g. a closed complete pathological fracture.
$\checkmark$ Linear fracture: A fracture that is parallel to the bone's long axis.
$\checkmark$ Transverse fracture: A fracture that is at a right angle to the bone's long axis.
$\checkmark$ Oblique \#: A fracture that is diagonal to a bone's long axis.
Spiral \#: A \# where at least one part of the bone has been twisted

\section*{2. FRACTURE LOCACTON}

In long bones fractures are described as being proximal, distal as midshaft, based on their location on the bone.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-04.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}
A. Colle's fracture: - common fracture in which the distal radius is fractured within 1 inch of articullar surface.
B. Pott's fracture: - occurs to the medial malleolus of the tibia and fibula and often is associated with rapture of the internal lateral ligmament or chipping off a piece of the medial malleolus or both.

This two were named after the physician who first described them.

\section*{ETIOLOGY}

The most common is direct trauma to the bone which may be caused by a motor vehicle accident and falls. Other causes include;-
- Primary bone disease such as osteoporosis or metastatic bone cancer can weaken the bony structure and lead to fracture.
- Direct force - the fracture occurs at the point of contact with an object.
- The humerus when some one tries to throw a stone or disk in sport

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}

When a bone is broken, the periosteum and blood vessels in the cortex, marrow and surrounding tissue are disrupted and begin to bleed. A hematoma forms between the fractured ends of the bone and beneath the periosteum. Bone tissue immediately adjacent to the fracture dies. This necrotic tissue stimulates an intense inflammatory response characterized by vasodilation of plasma and leukocytes as well as increased production of prostaglandins.

All these factors lead to the symptoms and signs of pain, swelling and dysfunction.

\section*{BONE HEALING}

Bone unlike some other specialized tissues is able to regenerate. Fracture healing occurs by the formation of new none tissue. New bone is formed by the activation of osteoclast and osteoblasts. Fractures usually heal over 6 weeks in the following stages

\section*{Stage 1; Hematoma formation}

In 24 hours the blood clots begins to organize. As the blood in the hematoma coagulates a loose delicate mesh of fibrin forms around the fracture site. This fibrin mesh protectively encloses the damaged bone and acts as a scaffold for the in growth of the capillary buds and fibroblasts. These new capillaries grow into the hematoma.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-05.jpg?height=438&width=512&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=464)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}

The main blood supply increases to the bone ends unlike most hematomas, this one does not resolve on healing by undergoes changes into granulation tissue.

\section*{Stage II Cellular Proliferation}

The cells at the bone ends proliferate from the periosteum, endosteum and the bone marrow. The injury to the periosteum stimulates the deep layers so that proliferation of the osteoblast takes place. After several days, osteogenesis and granulation of tissue forms a collar around the end of each fragments. The collars advances and eventually unite and form a bridge across the fracture.

\section*{Stage III Callus formation}

After 6-10 days after injury, the granulation tissue changes to the pre-callus. Newly formed cartilage and bone matrix (derived from the undamaged periosteum and endosteum) disperse through the soft tissue callus to form a provisional callus. This is made up of a large, loosely woven mass of bone and cartilage and is wider than the normal bone diameter. It secures the bone fragments but does not provide strength. It extends beyond the fracture line to form a splint. For uncomplicated fractures the size of the callus reaches its maximal size by 14-21 days after injury.

\section*{Stage IV Ossification}

A permanent callus of true rigid bone eventually forms by the deposition of calcium salts which knits the fracture ends together. Ossification first forms an external callus then an internal callus and finally an intermediate callus. During the $3^{\text {rd }}-10^{\text {th }}$ weeks of healing, the callus converts into bone. This formation of born firmly binds together the fractured ends and completes healing.

\section*{Stage V Consolidation and remodeling}

At the time bone is being formed the callus is remodeled by osteoclastic activity. In effect excess bone is chiseled away and absorbed from the callus. This remodeling is affected by the stress on it by muscles and weight bearing. This follows the Wolff's law, which basically states that a bone's structure is determined by its function, that is, the stresses and strains placed on it.

\section*{HEALING TIME}

This varies with the
- Type of fracture- impacted and displaced fractures take longer.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-06.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)
- Type of bone- spongy bone takes shorter time than compact bone e.g. arms 3 months while legs take 6 months.

Factors that enhance fracture healing.
- Immobilization of fracture fragments.
- Maximum bone fragment contact.
- Sufficient blood supply.
- Proper nutrition.
- Electrical potential a cross fracture e.t.c.

Factors that inhibit fracture healing.
1. Inadequate immobilization
2. Decreased supply of blood due to severance of vessels supplying the bone or swelling
3. Infection
4. Metabolic bone disease (e.g. Paget's disease).
5. Age (elderly persons heal more slowly).
6. Corticosteroids (inhibit the repair rate).

\section*{Clinical manifestations}
- Deformity-alignment and contour changes
- Swelling/edema- due to inflammatory process and hematoma formation
- Ecchymosis (bruising)-due to subcutaneous bleeding
- Muscle spasm-involuntary muscle contraction near fracture
- Pain-immediate severe pain due to injury. pain due to muscle spasm later and due to inflammation
$\checkmark$ Bone pain is x-terised as dull \&deep
$\checkmark$ Muscle pain as soreness or aching/muscle cramps
$\checkmark$ \# pain as sharp and piercing relieved by immobilization
$\checkmark$ Sharp pain can also be due to bone infection or pressure on a sensory nerve
$\checkmark$ Pain increasing with activity may indicate joint /muscle sprain,
$\checkmark$ Steadily increasing pain- progression of an infectious process, malignant tumors or neurovascular condition
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-07.jpg?height=438&width=512&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=464)
$\checkmark$ Radiating pain- pressure on a nerve.
- impaired sensation or numbness due to nerve damage or entrapment from edema ,bleeding or bone fragmentation. Paresthesias i.e. Burning, tingling sensations or numbness that can be due to pressure on nerves, or circulatory impairment. So assess the neurovascular function
- Loss of normal function due to instability, pain, muscle spasm or nerve damage.
- Abnormal movement due to instability especially in the long bones e.g. the femur.
- Crepitus-grating sensation or sound felt or heard if the injured part is moved due to bone ends rubbing against each other
- Hypovolemic shock -blood loss in severe injuries

\section*{Diagnosis}
- Imaging studies i.e. x-ray studies, C.T scanning, M.R.I's, arthrography, bone densitometry
- Nuclear studies:- bone scan, arthroscopy,
- Other studies:- arthrocentesis, Electromyography, Biopsy
- Lab studies:- blood \& urine that gives information about primary M.S.S problem e.g. pagets' ds, dvlping complication, baseline for instituting therapy

\section*{Read on each of the above diagnostic procedure}

\section*{Complications}
1. Arterial damage -contusion, thrombosis, severance, lacerations by the fracture or the cast. Arteries may be constricted by bandages or casts that are too tight.

Diagnosis is -absent pulse, swelling, pallor, patch cyanosis distal to fracture, blood loss, large fracture hematomas, cold extremity, poor capillary refill and anesthesia.

\section*{2. Compartment syndrome}

A compartment syndrome is a closed place which is made up of bones, muscles, nerves and blood vessels wrapped by a fibrous membrane. Bleeding or edema may occur within it thus exerting pressure on the pliable muscles, nerves and vessels. It can also occur due to external pressure from a tight dressing or cast. It is characterized by ischemic pain not relieved by narcotic analgesic and occurs on raising /elevation due to a
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-08.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}
decrease in arterial flow and also when touched. There also will be inactivity, absent pulses, coolness, parasthesias (needles and pins sensations) and pallor.

Management is by removing the cause e.g. cast or dressing and incase of edema or bleeding fasciotomy is done and the place left open until the edema or bleeding stops. If not managed on time it may lead to loss of the limb because of the need of amputation.

\section*{3. Fat embolism}

A potentially life threatening condition occurs with fractures of long bones and the pelvis. It occurs 24-48 hours after injury and two theories explain is etiology.
a) Mechanical theory- trauma causes disruption of the fragile veins and the fat cells in the bone marrow. Fat globules enter the circulation aided by increased pressure from the hematoma at the fracture site.
b) Biochemical - catecholamines released due to the stress of injury mobilizes lipids from the adipose tissue and makes them coalesce into large droplets which embolise the lung.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Once the fat globules reach the lung they are unable to pass through its circulation. They lodge in the vessels and breakdown into FA. Free fatty acids are toxic to the lung parenchyma, capillary endothelium and the surfactant. The result is pulmonary hypertension.

\section*{Presentation}
- Altered mental status
- Tachypnea
- Tachycardia
- Hypoxemia
- Petechiae
- Fever
4. Infection -Due to contamination in open fractures or during surgery on the fractures. It may lead to delayed union, osteomylitis or gas gangrene. This may necessitate amputation
5. Shock- resulting from massive hemorrhage.

\section*{6. Volkmann's Ischemic contracture}

This occurs in the arm and form as a result of fracture affecting the elbow or forearm bones. It begins as a compartment syndrome that compromises the arterial and venous circulation. This results in prolonged ischemia
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-09.jpg?height=438&width=515&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=462)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}
with degeneration of the muscle tissue and replacement with fibrous tissue. This fibrous tissue traps tendons and nerves. The typical result is a permanent, stiff, claw like deformity of the arm and the hand.

The Volkmann's contracture is most common with a supracondylar fracture of the humerus but can occur with crushing injuries or tight bandages. To avoid such deformity, compartment syndrome should be diagnosed and treated early.
Other early complications include:-
- DVT, thromboembolism and pulmonary embolus which are associated with reduced skeletal muscle contraction and bed rest.

\section*{LONG TERM COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{1. Delayed union}

This is failure of a fracture to consolidate within the required time frame. This occurs due to retardation of the healing process. It can be managed by additional time and the removal of the cause.

\section*{2. Nonunion}

It is the failure of a fracture site to consolidate and produce a complete, firm and stable union after 6-9months. It is characterized by excessive motion in the fracture site that leads to a false joint (pseudoarthrosis). Causes are similar to those of delayed. Management is by use of bone grafts.

\section*{3. Malunion}

This is the healing of a fracture site with an increased degree of angulation or deformity. If seen early in fracture healing it can be corrected with re-immobilization. Malunion after healing is usually corrected with surgery. Other delayed complications include:-
- A vascular necrosis of bone, reaction to internal fixation devices, complex region pain syndrome, heterotrophic ossification.

\section*{MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF FRACTURES.}

The primary goals are;-
1. To return limb to maximal function
2. Prevent complications
3. Obtain the best possible cosmetic result.
-Vital signs should be monitored closely because of the risk of shock due to hemorrhage, pain or embolism.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-10.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}
-Patient should be kept NPO depending on the type of fracture because there might be need for surgery.
-Ensure rest and rest may be also promoted by not using the affected parts like for fractures of the distal phalanges most often it is the only form of management for such fractures.
-There are $\mathbf{3}$ main forms of definitive management for fractures. These are;-

\section*{I) Reduction}

This is the restoration of the injured bone to the normal anatomic alignment, position and length. It also brings the fractured fragments together to promote healing. This is usually painful and requires anesthesia especially in complete displaced fractures or impacted ones.

Undisplaced fractures do not require reduction and may only require splinting to avoid displacement.

\section*{Types of reduction include}
1. Closed reduction/manipulation-In this case a physician brings the bone fragments into alignment without making a surgical incision. This may be done in 3 ways
- Traction and counter traction
- Angulation
- Rotation

This requires a lot of skill and x-ray films are taken to confirm alignment then a cast is usually applied to splint it.
2. Open reduction-An incision is made and fracture is aligned during surgery under direct vision. The time of surgery, various fixation devices may be applied to the fracture bone to maintain alignment (e.g. screws, plates, pins, wires, nails), or rods may be placed through bone fragments, fixed to the sides of the bone or inserted directly into the bone's medullary cavity.

It is the treatment of choice in compound fractures that are comminuted and accompanied by serious neurovascular injuries, widely separated fragments or soft tissue interposition. It is also recommended for fracture of femur and of joints. Internal fixation helps immobilize a fracture and prevent deformity and is not a substitute for healing. So with time without bone healing they succumb to stress, loosen or break.

\section*{II) Traction}

Therapeutic traction (pull) is accomplished by exerting a pull on the head, body or limbs in two directions i.e. pull of traction and of counter traction.
- Traction is produced by weights
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-11.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}
- Counter traction by person's weight or other weights (pulleys, weight and ropes.)

The traction should
1. Support and stretch the extremity in a direction that properly aligns bone fragments
2. Overstretch the limb
3. Maintain stretching forces that are constant until union of bones.

Traction is applied in the directions in line with the long axis of the bone while for the head and pelvis traction is in the direction of the spinal column.

With traction of the long limbs the bed is elevated so as to reduce the amount of counter traction required. Thus only the person's body is needed.

\section*{Methods of applying traction}
- Manually pulling on the body parts with the hands
- Mechanically by exerting a pull on the body part with ropes and pulleys
- With devices inserted in the cast (plaster traction)
- With braces (e.g. hyperextension braces)

\section*{Advantages}
i. Greater potential for exercising the joints and muscles than it is possible with casts
ii. Elimination of surgery and its complications.

\section*{Disadvantages}
I. Prolonged hospitalization
II. Bed rest necessary
III. Risk of complications like venous thrombosis, osteoporosis and bedsores due to immobility

\section*{Purpose of traction.}
- Reduce fracture or dislocation and maintain alignment
- Decrease muscles spasms and relieve pain
- Correct, lessen or prevent deformities
- Promote rest of a diseased or injured part.
- Promote exercise.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-12.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{Indications for traction.}
- Bone fractures.
- Bone dislocation.
- Muscle spasms.
- Lower back pain.
- Disc prolapsed.

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE TRACTION.}
1. Traction must be continuous to be effective in reducing and immobilizing fractures.
2. Skeletal traction is never interrupted.
3. Weight is not removed unless intermittent traction is prescribed.
4. Any factor that might reduce the effective pull or alter its resultant line of pull must be eliminated.
5. For traction to be effective there must be counter traction i.e. force acting in the opposite direction.

There are two main forms of traction
1. Skin traction- strapping (legs), anklets, corsets (pelvic fracture) and halters (on the head for cervical problems) are used to apply traction on particular parts of the body. It is used to immobilize an area before surgery and control muscle spasms. the amount of weight applied must not exceed the tolerance of the skin no more than 23.5 KG of traction can be used on an extremity. Pelvic traction is usually $4.5-9 \mathrm{KGS}$ depending on the weight of the patient
2. Skeletal traction- metal wires or pins are surgically inserted into bones or metals tongs anchored in the skull. The weights are attached to the pin or wire by a rope and pulley system that exerts the appropiriate amount and direction of pull for effective traction. It frequently uses $7-12 \mathrm{KGS}$.

Example of types of traction
a. Buck's traction-It is a form of skin traction exerted by the pull on one or both legs. It is used to immobilize a limb for a short time while waiting for another form of management like hip replacement or to reduce muscle spasm.

Other uses include TB of the hip, arthritis and pelvic injuries. It is contraindicated in diabetic gangrene, stasis dermatitis and serious varicosities.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-13.jpg?height=438&width=512&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=464)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}

A fabricated boot (cast) not restricting movement of the ankle is put 1 to 2 inches below the knee. The traction is usually continuous. Incase there is need to charge the weights, manual traction should be applied while the change is being made.
b. Cervical traction - It holds the head in extension to treat muscles sprains, strains and spasm and is usually applied with a head halter. Skeletal cervical traction using skull tongs or a halo apparatus may be used in stabilizing fracture or dislocations of the cervical or upper thoracic spine. A halo consists of a head piece with four pins, two anterior and two posterior. The head piece attaches to a body jacket. The purpose is immobilization and currently they are rarely used.
c. Pelvic traction accomplished with a belt applied just above and encircling the iliac crests. The belt attaches to the spreader bar and pulley system. Traction is applied to the lumber spine.
d. Russell's traction-this is a modification of the buck's traction. It adds a vertical pull by placing a sling under the leg above the knee. It is used to immobilize hip fracture or the shaft of the femur.

\section*{Potential complications.}

Skin break down: - which results from irritation caused by contact of the skin with the tape foam and shearing forces.

Nerve pressure: - results from pressure on the peripheral nerves.
Circulatory impairment: - which is usually manifested by cold skin temperature, decreased peripheral pulses, slow capillary refill time and bluish skin.

\section*{Others are:-}
* Anorexia.
* Constipation.
* Urinary stasis and infection.
* Venous stasis with DVT.
* Pneumonia.
* Pressure ulcers.

\section*{III) Casting}

They are temporary devices made from plaster of Paris or fiber glass that are used to immobilize a body part, usually an extremity. Its purpose is
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-14.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)
a. Immobilize a reduced fracture.
b. Prevent or correct deformities e.g. talipes equinoverus.
c. Maintenance of support and protection to realign bone.
d. Promotion of healing which allows early weight bearing for ambulation.

\section*{Types of casts}

Short arm- extends from thumb and palm to mid arm. Used to treat fracture distal radius, humerus as a hanging cast, wrist sprains and carpal fractures.

Short leg- used to treat fracture of the tibia, fibula and ankle. It extends from foot to hip and holds knee in flexion if fracture is unstable to prevent weight bearing. If eight permitted a cylinder cast is used
Cast brace- it is used to treat a stable distal femur fracture. Has two parts above and below knee with a hinge to allow knee joint movement.
Body cast:- encircles the trunk
Hip spica- used to treat fracture of the hip and to immobilize the hip. Cast extends from mid trunk to foot or feet, hips abducted with a bar. An opening is made for elimination.

Walking cast:- ashort or long leg cast reinforced for strength
Shoulder spica cast:- abody jacket that encloses the trunk,shoulder and elbow

\section*{ASSESSMENT BEFORE APPLYING THE CAST.}

The nurse completes an assessment of the patient general health, presenting signs and symptoms, emotional status, understanding the need for the cast and condition of the body part to be immobilized in the cast. The physical assessment of the part to be immobilizes must include assessment of the neurovascular status (neurologic and circulatory functioning) of the body part, degree and location of swelling, bruising and skin abrasion. NURSING INTERVENTIONS.

\section*{Explaining the treatment regimen.}

Before applying the cast the patient needs information concerning the pathological problem and the purpose and expectations of the prescribed treatment regimen. Preparation of the patient for application of the cast by describing the anticipated sights sounds and sensations e.g. heat from the hardening reaction of plaster.
Relieving pain.
The patient should elevate the affected part, apply cold as prescribed and administer usual dosages of analgesics.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-15.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}
$\checkmark$ Pain associated with the disease process is controlled by immobilization.
$\checkmark$ Pain due to edema that is associated with trauma, surgery or bleeding into the tissue can be controlled by elevation and intermittent application of cold.

Improving mobility.
Every joint that is not immobilized should be exercised and moved through its range of motion to maintain function. If the patient has a leg cast, the nurse encourages exercising. If the patient has an arm cast, the nurse encourages finger exercise.

\section*{Maintaining adequate neurovascular function.}
\$ The nurse monitors circulation, motion and sensation of the affected extremity.
* Assess the fingers or toes of the casted extremity and comparing them with those of the opposite extremity. Normal findings include minimal swelling, minimal discomfort, pink color, warm to touch, rapid capillary refill response, normal sensations and ability to exercise fingers or toes.
\$ The nurse encourages the patient to move fingers or toes hourly when awake to stimulate circulation.
NB; The nurse should never ignore complains of pain from the patient in cast because of the possibility of potential problems such as impaired tissue perfusion or pressure ulcer formation.

\section*{Monitoring and managing potential complications.}

\section*{1. Compartment syndrome.}

It occurs when there is increased tissue pressure within a limited space that compromises the circulation and the function of tissue within the confined area.

To relieve the pressure the cast must be cut into half longitudinally while maintaining alignment and the extremity must be elevated no higher than heart level.

The nurse records neurovascular responses and promptly reports changes to the physician.

\section*{2. Pressure ulcers.}

It may cause tissue anoxia and pressure ulcers. Lower extremity sites most susceptible to pressure are the heel, head of the fibula, dorsum of the foot and anterior surface of the patella.

The patient usually reports of pain and tightness in the area.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-16.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{3. Disuse syndrome.}

It occurs due to inability to use the affected area. The nurse assists the patient to learn to tense or contract muscles without moving the affected part, this helps to reduce muscle atrophy and maintain muscle strength.

When the cast is dry the patient is instructed as follows:-
* Move about as normally as possible, but avoid excessive use of the injured extremity and avoid walking on wet, slippery floor.
- Perform prescribed exercise regularly.
* Elevate the casted extremity to heart level frequently to prevent swelling.
* Don't attempt to scratch the skin under the cast because it may cause break in the skin and hence result in the formation of skin ulcer.
* Keep the cast dry but do not cover it with plastic or rubber because this causes condensation which dampens the cast and skin.
* Report any of the following to the nurse: persistent pain, swelling that does not respond to elevation, change in sensation , decreased ability to move exposed fingers or toes and changes in skin color and temperature.
* Note odors around the cast, stained areas, warm spots and pressure areas.
* Report a broken cast to the physician; do not attempt to fix it yourself.

\section*{Other management for fracture patients include;-}

Nutrition-increased dietary fiber helps with maintaining normal bowel movements in clients who are immobile.
A well balanced diet promotes healing.
Exercises- the nurse should encourage the client to exercise to stimulate venous return, enhance healing and rehabilitation.

Health education should be given on the various methods of definitive management employed, nutrition, exercise, post hospital care e.g. care of the plaster
- Other needs arising with fractures will be managed symptomatically e.g.
- analgesics will be offered for pain,
- Antibiotics for open fractures to prevent or treat infection including the post surgical cases.
- Wound dressing where necessary
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-17.jpg?height=438&width=512&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=464)
- Skin care incase of long admission to include massage especially to patients on traction
- The other activities of daily living e.g. elimination, bathing,
- Pre and post operative care
- Promotion of rest.

It is a common injury that results from a direct blow to the shoulder or a fall.

\section*{Management}

\section*{When not disrupted}
- A clavicular strap /figure of 8 bandages may be used to pull the shoulder back, reducing and immobilizing the fractures. When used the axillae are well padded to prevent compression injury to the brachial plexus and the axillae artery.
- The nurse monitors the circulation and nerve function of both arms.
- A sling may be used to support the arm and to relieve pain.
- The nurse cautions the patient not to elevate the arm above the shoulder level until the ends of the bone have united but encourage the patient to exercise the elbow, wrist and fingers.
- Vigorous activities are limited for 3 months.

When disrupted open reduction with internal fixation is done (ORIF)
Complications :- trauma to the nerves of the brachial plexus, injury to the subclavian vein or artery from a bony fragment and malunion

\section*{HUMERAL NECK}

\section*{Management}
- The arm is supported and immobilized by a sling and swathe that secure the supported arm trunk.
- A soft pad is placed to absorb moisture and avoid skin breakdown.
- This fracture takes 6-10 weeks to heal so the patient should avoid vigorous activities e.g. tennis for additional 4 weeks.
- Circumduction exercise should be performed as soon as tolerated.

When the fracture is displaced treatment of colsed reduction,ORIF are the best

\section*{HUMERAL SHAFT}

They are mostly caused by:-
1. Direct trauma that results in transverse, oblique, or comminuted fracture.
2. In direct twisting force that result in spiral fracture.

\section*{Management.}
- Well padded splints overwrapped with elastic bandage are used to immobilize the upper arm and to support the arm in 90 degrees of flexion at the elbow.
- External fixations are used to treat open fractures of the humeral shaft
- Functional bracing is another treatment which allows active use of muscles

Complication: - delayed union and nonunion because of decreased blood supply in that area

\section*{ELBOW}

They result from motor vehicle crashes, falls on the elbow or direct blow. These fractures may result in injury to the median, radial, or ulnar nerves.

\section*{Management}

The goal is to promote reduction and stabilization of the distal humerus fracture, followed by controlled active motion after swelling has subsided and healing has begun. If the fracture is not displaced, the arm is immobilized in a cast or posterior splint with the elbow at 45 or 90 degrees of flexion and in a sling for 4-6 weeks. Then a thermoplastic splint is used to support the fracture and a rehabilitation exercise has begun.

If it is displaced it is treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF)
- Active exercise of the elbow is performed as prescribed to prevent residual limitation of motion.
- Active finger exercise are encouraged

Complication: compartment syndrome, volkmann's contracture which results from antecubital swelling or damage to the brachial artery hemarthrosis (blood in the joint) if it is present they may aspirate the joint to remove the blood, thereby relieving the pressure and pain.

\section*{RADIAL HEAD}

They are common and are usually produced by a fall on the outstretched hand with the elbow extended.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-19.jpg?height=438&width=512&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=464)

Management.
- If blood has collected in the elbow joint it is aspirated to relieve pain and allow early active elbow and forearm ROM.
- Immobilization of these with a splint and instruct the patient not to lift the arm for approximately 4 weeks.
- If the fracture is displaced surgery is required, with excision of the radial head where necessary. Post operatively the arm is immobilized in a posterior plaster splint and sling. Encourage the patient to carry out active motion of the elbow and fore arm as prescribed.

\section*{RADIAL AND ULNAR SHAFTS}

They occur frequently in children. The radius or the ulna may be fractured at any level.

\section*{Management}
- If it is not displaced, the fracture is treated by closed reduction with a long arm cast applied from the upper arm to the proximal palmer crease.Asses for circulation, motion, and sensation of the hand after the cast are applied. The arm is elevated to control edema. Frequent finger flexion and extension are encouraged to reduce edema.
- The fracture is immobilized for about 12 weeks, lifting and twisting are avoided.
- Displaced fracture are managed by orif using compression plate with crews

\section*{RIBS}

Uncomplicated fracture of the ribs occurs frequently in adults and usually results in no impairment of function. These fracture produce painful respiration, the patient tends to decrease respiratory excursions and refrains from coughing. To help this patient cough and take deep breaths, the nurse may splint the chest with her hands. The doctor may administer intercostals nerve block to relieve pain and to permit productive coughing.

Chest strapping to immobilize the rib fracture is not used, because decreased chest expansion may result in pneumonia and atelectasis. The pain may diminish significantly in 3-4 days and the fracture may heal within 6weeks.

Complications:- Atelectasis,pneumonia,flail chect,pneumothorax and hemothorax
Assignment:- read on signs and sypmtoms and management
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-20.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{TIBIAL AND FIBULA}

The most common fracture below the knee is one of the tibia that result from a direct blow, falls with foot in a flexed position, or a violent twisting motion. They occur in association with each other.

\section*{Clinical manifestation}

Pain, deformity, hematoma and considerable hematoma.

\section*{Assessment and diagnostic findings}
- Peroneal nerve damage is assessed. If is affected the patient is unable to dorsiflex the great toe and has diminished sensation in the first web space.
- Tibial artery damage is assessed by evaluating pulses, skin temperature and color by testing the capillary refill response.
- The patient is monitored for an anterior compartment syndrome. Symptoms include pain unrelieved by medication and increasing with planter flexion.

\section*{Medical management}
- Closed fractures are treated with closed reduction and immobilization in a long leg walking cast.
- Partial weight bearing is usually prescribed after 7-10 days
- The cast is changed to a short leg cast or brace in 3-4 weeks which allows for knee motion for activity which decreases edema and increases circulation.
- Comminuted fractures may be treated with skeletal traction, internal fixation with intramedullary nails or plates and screws or intertenal fixation.
- Hip, foot and knee exercise are encouraged within the limits of the immobilizing device
- Open fractures are treated with external fixation.

Complications: compartment syndrome, delayed union, infection, impaired wound edge healing due to limited soft tissue, and loosening of the internal fixation hardware.

\section*{PELVIS.}

The sacrum, ilium, pubis and ischium bones form the pelvic bone. Falls motor vehicle crashes and crush injuries can cause pelvic fractures. There is high mortality a associated with pelvic fractures related to hemorrhage, pulmonary complications, fat emboli, intravascular coagulation, thromboembolic complication and infection.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-21.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{Signs and symptoms}

Ecchymosis; tenderness over the symphysis pubis, anterior iliac spines, iliac crest, sacrum or coccyx; local swelling; numbness or tingling of pubis, genetals, and proximal thighs; and inability to bear weight without discomfort.

\section*{Diagnosis.}

Computer tomography of the pelvis helps to determine the extent of injury by demonstrating sacroiliac joint disruption, soft tissue trauma, pelvic hematoma and fractures.

\section*{MANAGEMENT.}

It depends on the severity of the fracture.
Unstable ,weight bearing pelvic fractures are treated with external fixation devices and through open reduction with internal fixation.

Less severe fractures of non-weight- bearing portions can be successfully treated with bed rest and traction.

\section*{Nursing management}
- Maintaining adequate circulation to the skin because the patient on traction can not turn.
- Adequate pain control
- Assessment of neurovascular status, and assessment for complications such as thrombophlebitis and fat embolism.

\section*{NURSING PROCESS:}

\section*{THE PATIENT IN A CAST}

\section*{Assessment}

Before the cast is applied, the nurse completes an assessment of the patient's general health, presenting signs and symptoms, emotional status, understanding of the need for the cast,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-22.jpg?height=438&width=512&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=464)

The condition of the body part to be immobilized in the cast. Physical assessment of the part to be immobilized must include assessment of the neurovascular status (neurologic and circulatory functioning) of the body part, degree and location of swelling, bruising, and skin abrasions.

\section*{EXPLAINING THE TREATMENT REGIMEN}

Before the cast is applied, the patient needs information concerning the pathologic problem and the purpose and expectations of the prescribed treatment regimen. This knowledge promotes the patient's active participation in and adherence to the treatment program.

\section*{RELIEVING PAIN}

The nurse must carefully evaluate pain associated with musculoskeletal problems, asking the patient to indicate the exact site and to describe the character and intensity of the pain to help determine its cause. Most pain can be relieved by elevating the involved part, applying cold as prescribed, and administering usual dosages of analgesics.

\section*{IMPROVING MOBILITY}

Every joint that is not immobilized should be exercised and moved through its range of motion to maintain function.

\section*{PROMOTING HEALING OF SKIN ABRASIONS}

Before the cast is applied, it is important to treat skin lacerations and abrasions to promote healing. The nurse thoroughly cleans the skin and treats it as prescribed. Sterile dressings are used to cover the injured skin. If the skin wounds are extensive, an alternative method (eg, external fixator) may be chosen to immobilize the body part.

While the cast is on, the nurse observes the patient for systemic signs of infection, odors from the cast, and purulent drainage staining the cast

\section*{MAINTAINING ADEQUATE NEUROVASCULAR FUNCTION}

The nurse monitors circulation, motion, and sensation of the affectedextremity, assessing the fingers or toes of the casted extremity andcomparing them with those of the opposite extremity. Normal findings include minimal swelling, minimal discomfort, pink color, warm to touch, rapid capillary refill response, normal sensations, and ability to exercise fingers or toes. The nurse encourages the patient to move fingers or toes hourly when awake to stimulate circulation.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-23.jpg?height=438&width=512&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=464)

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS Compartment Syndrome}

To relieve the pressure, the cast must be bivalved (cut in half longitudinally) while maintaining alignment, and the extremity must be elevated no higher than heart level If pressure is not relieved and circulation is not restored, a fasciotomy may be necessary to relieve the pressure within the muscle compartment

\section*{Pressure Ulcers}

Pressure of the cast on soft tissues may cause tissue anoxia and pressure ulcers Usually, the patient with a pressure ulcer reports pain and tightness in the area. A warm area on the cast suggests underlying tissue erythema. The area may break down. The drainage may stain the cast and emit an odor. monitor the patient with a cast for pressure ulcer development and report findings to the physician.

\section*{Disuse Syndrome}

While in a cast, the patient needs to learn to tense or contract muscles (eg, isometric muscle contraction) without moving the part Isometric exercises should be performed hourly while the patient is awake

\section*{HEALTH EDUCATION.}

When the cast is dry, the nurse instructs the patient as follows:
- Move about as normally as possible, but avoid excessive use of the injured extremity and avoid walking on wet, slippery floors or sidewalks.
- Perform prescribed exercises regularly, as scheduled.
- Elevate the casted extremity to heart level frequently to prevent swelling.
- Do not attempt to scratch the skin under the cast. This may cause a break in the skin and result in the formation of a skin ulcer. Cool air from a hair dryer may alleviate an itch.
- Cushion rough edges of the cast with tape.
- Keep the cast dry but do not cover it with plastic or rubber,because this causes condensation, which dampens the cast and skin. Moisture softens a plaster cast. (A wet fiberglass cast must be dried thoroughly with a hair dryer on a cool setting to avoid skin problems.)
- Report any of the following to the physician: persistent pain, swelling that does not respond to elevation, changes in sensation, decreased ability to move exposed fingers or toes, and changes in skin color and temperature.
- Note odors around the cast, stained areas, warm spots, and pressure areas. Report them to the physician.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-24.jpg?height=438&width=512&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=464)
- Report a broken cast to the physician; do not attempt to fix it .

The nurse prepares the patient for cast removal or cast changes by explaining what to expect

\section*{BODY OR SPICA CASTS}
- The nurse positions the pillows next to each other, because spaces between pillows allow the damp cast to sag,become weak, and possibly break.
- A pillow is not placed under the head and shoulders of a patient in a body cast while the cast is drying, because doing so causes pressure on the chest.
- The nurse turns the patient as a unit toward the uninjured side every 2 hours to relieve pressure and to allow the cast to dry
- A stabilizing abduction bar incorporated into a spica cast should not be used as a turning device.
- The nurse adjusts the pillows to provide support without creating areas of pressure.
- The skin can be bathed and massaged by reaching under the cast edges with the fingers.
- The perineal opening must be large enough for hygienic care.
- Cast syndrome: psychological the nurse needs to recognize the anxiety reaction
- and provide an environment in which the patient feels secure.

The physiologic cast syndrome responses (superior mesenteric artery syndrome) are associated with immobility in a body cast. With decreased physical activity, gastrointestinal motility decreases, intestinal gases accumulate, intestinal pressure increases, and ileus may occur. The patient exhibits abdominal distention, abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting If the cast restricts the abdomen, the abdominal window must be enlarged monitor bowel sounds.

\section*{Splints and Braces}
$\checkmark$ Contoured splints of plaster or pliable thermoplastic materials may be used for conditions that do not require rigid immobilization, for those in which swelling may be anticipated, and for those that require special skin care.
$\checkmark$ The splint needs to immobilize and support the body part in a functional position. The splint must be well padded to prevent pressure, skin abrasion, and skin breakdown.
$\checkmark$ The splint is overwrapped with an elastic bandage applied in a spiral fashion and with pressure uniformly distributed so that the circulation is not restricted.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-25.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}
$\checkmark$ The nurse frequently assesses the neurovascular status and skin integrity of the splinted extremity frequently assesses the neurovascular status and skin integrity of the splinted extremity.
$\checkmark$ Provides skin care and makes adjustments for swelling.
$\checkmark$ Helps the patient learn to apply the brace and to protect the skin from irritation and breakdown.
Managing the Patient with an External Fixator
External fixators are used to manage open fractures with soft tissue damage. They provide stable support for severe comminuted (crushed or splintered) fractures while permitting active treatment of damaged soft tissues.

Complicated fractures of the humerus, forearm, femur, tibia, and pelvis are managed with external skeletal fixators.

The fracture is reduced, aligned, and immobilized by a series of pins inserted in the bone. Pin position is maintained through attachment to a portable frame. The
fixator facilitates patient comfort, early mobility, and active exercise of adjacent uninvolved joints. Complications related to disuse and immobility are minimized.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}
\$ It is important to prepare the patient psychologically for application of the external fixators. The apparatus looks clumsy and foreign.
\$ Reassurance that the discomfort associated with the device is minimal and that early mobility is anticipated promotes acceptance of the device.
* After the external fixator is applied, the extremity is elevated to reduce swelling. If there are sharp points on the fixator or pins,they are covered to prevent device-induced injuries.
* The nurse monitors the neurovascular status of the extremity every 2 to
* 4 hours and assesses each pin site for redness, drainage, tenderness, pain, and loosening of the pin. Some serous drainage from the pin sites is to be expected. The nurse must be alert for potential problems caused by pressure from the device on the skin, nerves, or blood vessels and for the development of compartment syndrome
* The nurse carries out pin care as prescribed to prevent pin tract infection. This typically includes cleaning each pin site separately three times a day with cotton-tipped applicators soaked in sterile saline solution. Crusts should not form at the pin site.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-26.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}
* If signs of infection are present or if the pins or clamps seem loose, the nurse notifies the physician.
* The nurse encourages isometric and active exercises within the limits of tissue damage.
\$ When the swelling subsides, the nurse helps the patient to become mobile within the prescribed weight bearing limits (non-weight bearing to full weight bearing).
* Adherence to weight-bearing instructions minimizes the chance of loosening of the pins when stress is applied to the bone-pin interface.
* The fixator is removed after the soft tissue heals. The fracture may require additional stabilization by a cast or molded orthosis while healing.
* The Ilizarov external fixator is a special device used to correct angulation and rotational defects, to treat nonunion (failure of bone fragments to heal), and to lengthen limbs.
* Tension wires are attached to fixators' rings, which are joined by telescoping rods.
* Bone formation is stimulated by prescribed daily adjustment of the telescoping rods. It is important to teach the patient how to adjust the telescoping rods and how to perform skin care. Generally, the nurse can encourage weight bearing. After the desired correction has been achieved, no additional adjustments are made, and the fixator is left in place until the bone heals.

\section*{PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE}

Teaching the Patient Self-Care. The nurse teaches the patient to perform pin site care according to the prescribed protocol and to report promptly any signs of pin site infection: redness, tenderness, increased or purulent pin site drainage, or fever.

The nurse also instructs the patient and family to monitor neurovascular status and report any changes promptly. The nurse teaches the patient or family member to check the integrity of the fixator frame daily and to report loose pins or clamps.

A physical therapy referral is helpful in teaching the patient how to transfer, use ambulatory aids safely, and adjust to weight-bearing limits and altered gait patterns

\section*{MANAGING THE PATIENT IN TRACTION}

Traction is the application of a pulling force to a part of the body.
Traction is used to minimize muscle spasms; to reduce, align, and immobilize fractures; to reduce deformity; and to increase space between opposing surfaces.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-27.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}

At times, traction needs to be applied in more than one direction to achieve the desired line of pull. When this is done, one of the lines of pull counteracts the other. These lines of pull are known as the vectors of force. The actual resultant pulling force is somewhere between the two lines of pull.

Traction is used primarily as a short-term intervention until other modalities, such as external or internal fixation, are possible.

This reduces the risk of disuse syndrome and minimizes the length of hospitalization, often allowing the patient to be cared for in the home setting.

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE TRACTION}

Whenever traction is applied, countertraction must be used to achieve effective traction. Countertraction is the force acting in the opposite direction. Usually, the patient's body weight and bed position adjustments supply the needed countertraction.

The following are additional principles to follow when caring for the patient in traction:
- Traction must be continuous to be effective in reducing and immobilizing fractures.
- Skeletal traction is never interrupted.
- Weights are not removed unless intermittent traction is prescribed.
- Any factor that might reduce the effective pull or alter its resultant line of pull must be eliminated:
- The patient must be in good body alignment in the center of the bed when traction is applied.
- Ropes must be unobstructed.
- Weights must hang free and not rest on the bed or floor.
- Knots in the rope or the footplate must not touch the pulley or the foot of the bed.

There are several types of traction. Straight or running traction applies the pulling force in a straight line with the body part resting on the bed. Buck's extension traction is an example of straight traction. Balanced suspension traction supports the affected extremity off the bed and allows for some patient movement without disruption of the line of pull. Traction may be applied to the skin (skin traction) or directly to the bony skeleton (skeletal traction). The mode of application is determined by the purpose of the traction. Traction can be applied with the hands (manual traction). This is temporary traction that may be used when applying a cast, giving skin care under a Buck's extension foam boot, or adjusting the traction apparatus.

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}

\section*{NURSING PROCESS: THE PATIENT IN TRACTION}

Assessment: Traction restricts one's mobility and independence. The equipment often looks threatening, and its application can be frightening. Confusion, disorientation, and behavioral problems may develop in patients.
- Therefore, the nurse must assess and monitor the patient's anxiety level and psychological responses to traction.
- It is important to evaluate the body part to be placed in traction and its neurovascular status (ie, color, temperature, capillary refill, edema, pulses, ability to move, and sensations) and compare it to the unaffected extremity.
- The nurse also assesses skin integrity along with body system functioning for baseline data.
- Ongoing assessment is indicated for the patient in traction. Immobility-related
- problems may include pressure ulcers, stasis pneumonia, constipation, loss of appetite, urinary stasis, urinary tract infections, and venous stasis. Early identification of preexisting or developing problems facilitates prompt interventions to resolve them.

Diagnosis

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSES}

Based on the nursing assessment, the patient's major nursing diagnoses related to traction may include the following:
- Deficient knowledge related to the treatment regimen
- Anxiety related to health status and the traction device
- Acute pain related to musculoskeletal disorder
- Self-care deficit: feeding, bathing/hygiene, dressing/grooming, and/or toileting related to traction
- Impaired physical mobility related to musculoskeletal disorder and traction

\section*{COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS/POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

Based on the assessment data, potential complications that may develop include the following:
- Pressure ulcer
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-29.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)
- Pneumonia
- Constipation
- Anorexia
- Urinary stasis and infection
- Venous stasis with DVT

\section*{Planning and Goals}

The major goals for the patient in traction may include understanding of the treatment regimen, reduced anxiety, maximum comfort, maximum level of self-care, maximum mobility within the therapeutic limits of traction, and absence of complications.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}

\section*{PROMOTING UNDERSTANDING OF THE TREATMENT REGIMEN}

The patient must understand the problem being treated and the rationale for the traction therapy. The nurse may need to repeat and reinforce the information. With increased understanding of the therapy, the patient becomes an active participant in health care.

\section*{REDUCING ANXIETY}

Before any traction is applied, the patient needs to be informed about the procedure, its purpose, and its implications. The nurse encourages the patient to participate in decisions that affect care.

After being in traction for a while, the patient may react to being confined to a limited space.
The nurse shouldencourage family and friends to visit frequently for the same reason. The nurse encourages diversional activities that can be performed within the limits of the traction.

\section*{ACHIEVING A MAXIMUM LEVEL OF COMFORT}

Because the patient is immobilized in bed, the mattress needs to be firm. Special mattresses or mattress overlays designed to minimize the development of pressure ulcers may be placed on the bed before the traction is applied.
The nurse can relieve pressure on dependent body parts by turning and positioning the patient for comfort within the limits of the traction and by making sure the bed linens remain wrinkle-free and dry.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-30.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ACHIEVING MAXIMUM SELF-CARE}

Initially, the patient may require assistance with self-care activities.
The nurse helps the patient eat, bathe, dress, and toilet. Convenient arrangement of items such as telephone, tissues, water, and assistive devices (eg, reachers, overbed trapeze) may facilitate self-care.

With resumption of self-care activities, the patient feels less dependent and less frustrated and experiences improved self-esteem.

Because some assistance is required throughout the period of immobility, the nurse and the patient can creatively develop routines that maximize the patient's independence.

\section*{ATTAINING MAXIMUM MOBILITY WITH TRACTION}

During traction therapy, the nurse encourages the patient to exercise muscles and joints that are not in traction to guard against their deterioration.

The physical therapist can design bed exercises that minimize loss of muscle strength.
During the patient's exercise, the nurse ensures that traction forces are maintained and that the patient is properly positioned to prevent complications resulting from poor alignment.

\section*{MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Pressure Ulcers}

The nurse examines the patient's skin frequently for evidence of pressure or friction, paying special attention to bony prominences.

It is helpful to reposition the patient frequently and to use protective devices (eg, elbow protectors) to relieve pressure.

If the risk of skin breakdown is high, as in a patient with multiple trauma or a debilitated elderly patient, use of a specialized bed is considered to prevent skin breakdown.

\section*{Pneumonia}

The nurse auscultates the patient's lungs every 4 to 8 hours to determine respiratory status and teaches the patient deep-breathing and coughing exercises to aid in fully expanding the lungs and moving pulmonary secretions. If the patient history and baseline assessment indicate that the patient is at high risk for development of respiratory complications, specific therapies. If a respiratory problem develops, prompt institution of prescribed therapy is needed.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-31.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{Constipation and Anorexia}

Reduced gastrointestinal motility results in constipation and anorexia. A diet high in fiber and fluids may help to stimulate gastric motility. If constipation develops, therapeutic measures might include stool softeners, laxatives, suppositories, and enemas.

To improve the patient's appetite, the nurse identifies and includes the patient's food preferences, as appropriate, within the prescribed therapeutic diet.

\section*{Urinary Stasis and Infection}

Incomplete emptying of the bladder related to positioning in bed can result in urinary stasis and infection.
In addition, the patient may find use of the bedpan uncomfortable and may limit fluids to minimize the frequency of urination. The nurse monitors the fluid intake and the character of the urine. The nurse teaches the patient to consume adequate amounts of fluid and to void every 3 to 4 hours. If the patient exhibits signs or symptoms of urinary tract infection, the nurse notifies the physician.

\section*{Venous Stasis and Deep Vein Thrombosis}

Venous stasis occurs with immobility. The nurse teaches the patientto perform ankle and foot exercises within the limits of the traction therapy every 1 to 2 hours when awake to prevent DVT, which may result from venous stasis. The patient is encouraged to drink fluids to prevent dehydration and associated hemoconcentration, which contribute to stasis. The nurse monitors the patient for signs of DVT, including calf tenderness, warmth,redness, swelling (increased calf circumference), and a positiveHomans' sign (discomfort in the calf when the foot is forcibly dorsiflexed). The nurse promptly reports findings to the physician for definitive evaluation and therapy.

\section*{STRAINS}

This is trauma to the body of a muscle or attachment of a tendon caused by overstretching misuse or overextension. They usually arise from twisting or wrenching movements. They may be
- Acute- occurring during unaccustomed vigorous exercise
- Chronic - develop over time after repetitive muscle overuse like in sports

There are 3 classes of strains
First degree strain -it is a gradual onset of muscle spasms, discomfort and loss of range of motion. No edema or ecchymosis is present. It involves pulling of the musculotendinous unit.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-32.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}
$\mathbf{2}^{\mathbf{n d}}$ degree strain- is identified by extreme muscle spasms; pain and edema develop immediately after injury. The area remains tender after acute symptoms subside. Ecchymosis develops within a few hours this strain involves tearing or straining of the musculotendinous unit.
$\mathbf{3}^{\text {rd }}$ degree strain- there is severe muscle spasm, point tenderness and edema at the site of injury, there is a sensation of sudden tearing or burning and there is a limited range of movement. This usually represents a complete rupture of the musculotendinous unit.

\section*{Management}
$\checkmark$ X-ray to rule out a possibility of a fracture
$\checkmark$ Acute stains require rest and possibly splinting
$\checkmark$ Elevation of the injured part to reduce edema /swelling.
$\checkmark$ Icepack application in the $1^{\text {st }}$ 24-48 hours to reduce swelling / swelling.
$\checkmark$ Heat may then be used to encourage reabsorption of blood and fluid to promote healing.
$\checkmark$ During healing (4-6 weeks) movement should be minimal. Activity should never be such that it produces symptoms such as pain or swelling
$\checkmark$ Rehabilitation by exercising after healing is complete.
$\checkmark$ Surgical repair may be necessary if rapture is present.

\section*{SPRAINS}

This is a ligament injury resulting from overstress causing damage to ligament fibers or their attachment. They are mainly caused by forced hyperextension. They are 3 grades
- Mild- tears a few ligaments with no loss of function
- Moderate-tears a portion causing loss of function
- Severe-complete tear of ligaments and require surgical management.

They are mainly
- Ankle sprains-Missteps during sports
- Upper limp sprains- when trying to break a fall or during sporting activity

$\checkmark$ Elevating area and applying cold compress/icepack
$\checkmark$ Immobilization may be necessary e.g. splinting (bandage) or casting for serious injuries for 3-4 weeks, cervical collar for cervical sprains.
$\checkmark$ Relieving pain with analgesics
$\checkmark$ Rehabilitation with exercise.

\section*{DISLOCATIONS AND SUBLAXATIONS}

These are displacements of a joint from its normal position. Dislocation -separation of both articulating surfaces while Sublaxation occurs when the articulating surfaces lose partial contact. They are caused by direct or indirect pressure to the joints. A displaced bone may impede blood supply, tear ligaments, and rupture blood vessels and damage nerves. They are also accompanied by fracture to the joint surface.

They present with localized pain and loss of function.
X-ray is taken to confirm the diagnosis.
Complications - aseptic necrosis or ischemia resulting from impaired blood supply to parts distal to the dislocation.

\section*{Management}
$\checkmark$ Closed reduction is done under general anesthesia
$\checkmark$ The joint is immobilized by a splint or cast for 3-6 weeks
$\checkmark$ Encourage exercise of the non immobilized joints
$\checkmark$ Rehabilitative exercises to be done after healing is complete.

\section*{ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY.}

Open reduction: - the correction and alignment of the fracture after surgical dissection and exposure of the fracture.

Internal fixation: - the stabilization of the reduced fracture by the use of metal screws, plates, nails and pins. Arthroplasty: - the repair of joint problems through the operating arthroscopy (an instrument that allows the surgeon to operate within a joint without a large incision) or through open joint surgery.
Hemi arthroplasty: - the replacement of one of the articular surfaces.
Joint arthroplasty or replacement: - the replacement of joint surfaces with metal or synthetic materials.

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}

Total joint arthroplasty or replacement: - the replacement of both articular surfaces within metal or synthetic materials.

Meniscectomy: - the excision of damaged joint fibro cartilage.
Amputation: - the removal of a body part.
Arthrodesis:- immobilizing fusion of a joint.

\section*{JOINT REPLACEMENT.}

Patient with joint pain and disability may undergo joint replacement. Conditions contributing to joint degeneration include:-
- Osteoarthritis (degeneration joint disease).
- Rheumatoid arthritis.
- Trauma.
- Congenital deformity.
- Some fractures e.g. femoral neck fracture may be managed with joint replacement.

Joint frequently replaced include the hip, knee and finger joints.

\section*{1. TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT.}

It is the replacement of the severely damaged hip with an artificial joint.

\section*{INDICATIONS.}
- Arthritis (degenerative joint disease, rheumatoid arthritis).
- Femoral neck fracture.
- Failure of previous reconstructive surgeries.
- Problems resulting from congenital hip disease.

\section*{Contraindications}
- Infection in or around the hip joint such as an anal fistula or urinary tract infection.
- A well functioning painless arthrodesis (a condition in which the hip joint is fused eliminating all movement) of the hip joint.
- Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, heart disease, lung disease, neurological disease, vascular disease and other systemic diseases that make the surgery very risky for the life of the patient
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-35.jpg?height=438&width=512&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=464)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}
- A well functioning painless excision arthroplasty (a condition in which due to tuberculosis, infection or a late presenting fracture neck femur the head and neck of the femur are surgically removed and the patient is put on vigorous physiotherapy so that a pseudo joint is formed between the pelvis and remaining part of the upper end of the femur) of the hip joint.

\section*{TYPES OF FRACTURED HIP}

Intracapsular :- the bone is broken inside the joint.
Extracapsular:- fracture occurs at the greater trochanter or can be an intertrochanteric fracture.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS.}

The nurse should be aware of and monitor for specific potential complications associated with total hip replacement. The complication include:-
* Dislocation of hip prosthesis.
* Excessive wound drainage.
* Thromboembolism.
- Infection.
* Heel pressure ulcers.

Other complications which the nurse must monitor include those associated with immobility, formation of bone in the peri prosthetic space, a vascular necrosis and loosening of the prosthesis.

\section*{Preventing dislocation of the hip prosthesis.}
* Teach the patient about positioning the leg in abduction, which helps to prevent dislocation of the prosthesis. The use of an abduction splint, a wedge pillow or two to three pillows between the legs keeps the hip in abduction.
$\checkmark$ When turning the patient in bed it is important to keep the operated hip in abduction.
$\checkmark$ The patient hip is never flexed more than 90 degrees to prevent this nurse should not elevate the head of the bed more than 60 degrees.
$\checkmark$ The patient is encouraged to sit in high -seat chairs, semi reclining wheelchairs and raised toilet seats may be used to minimize hip joint flexion.
$\checkmark$ When sitting the patient hip should be higher than the knees.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-36.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}
$\checkmark$ The patient affected leg should not be elevated when sitting.
$\checkmark$ The patient should use pillows between the legs when in supine or side lying position and when turning.
$\checkmark$ Acrade boot may be used to prevent leg rotation and to support the heel off the bed, preventing development of pressure ulcers.
$\checkmark$ Nurse should instruct the patient not to sleep on the side on which the surgery was performed without consulting the surgeon.
$\checkmark$ The patient should not close his / her legs.
$\checkmark$ The patient should not bend at the waist to put on shoes or socks.
The nurse recognizes dislocation of the prosthesis when there are the following indicators:-
- Increased pain at the surgical site, swelling and immobilization.
- Acute groin pain in affected hip or increased discomfort.
- Shortening of the leg.
- Abnormal external or internal rotation.
- Restricted ability or inability to move the legs.
- Reported 'popping' sensation in the hip.

\section*{Monitoring wound drainage.}

Drainage of $250-500 \mathrm{mls}$ in the first 24 hours is expected, by 48 hours postoperatively, the total drainage in 8 hours usually decreases to 30 mls or less and the sunction device is removed. The nurse informs the doctor if any drainage volume greater than anticipated.

\section*{Preventing deep vein thrombosis.}

The incidence of DVT is $45-70 \%$ and the peak occurrence is 5-7 days after surgery.
- The nurse monitors the patient closely for signs of DVT including calf pain, swelling, and tenderness.
- The nurse encourages the patient to consume adequate amount of fluids, perform ankle and foot exercise hourly while awake, use elastic stocking and sequential compression devices as prescribed.
- Transfer the patient out of bed and ambulate with assistance beginning on the first day post operatively.
- Low dose of heparin is given as prophylaxis for DVT after hip replacement.

Preventing infection.
Infection is a serious complication of total hip replacement and may necessitate removal of the implant.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-37.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

Patients who are at risk include:-
* Elderly patients.
* Obese patients.
* Poorly nourished and patient who have diabetes.
* Patient with rheumatoid arthritis.
* Patient with concurrent infections e.g. dental abscess.
- Prophylactic antibiotics are given.
- Indwelling catheter or portable wound sunction is removed.
- Severe infections may require surgical debridement or removal of prosthesis.
2. TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT.

It is the implantation of a device to substitute for the femoral condyles and the tibial joint surfaces
It is usually considered for patients who have severe pain and functional disabilities related to joint surfaces destroyed by arthritis or joint bleeding into the joint

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS.}
- Post operatively the knee is dressed with a compression bandage.
- Ice may be applied to control edema and bleeding.
- Administer analgesics before CPM to decrease pain
- Encourage active flexion of the foot every hour when the patient is awake. This is to prevent complications like thromboembolism, perineal nerve palsy, infection, limited range of motion.
- Suction should be done; the drainage ranges from $200-400 \mathrm{ml}$ during the first 24 hours after surgery and diminishes to less than 25 mls by 48 hours. After that the surgeon should be informed to remove the drains.
- Assist the patient to get out of bed on the evening or the day after surgery.
- The leg should not be dangled to prevent dislocation
- The nurse encourages the patient to use the continuous passive motion most of the time. The patients leg is placed in device, which increases circulation and range of motion of the knee joint.
- After discharge the patient may continue to use the CPM device at home and may undergo physical therapy on out patient basis.
- Avoid weight bearing and instruct the client in crutch walking
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-38.jpg?height=438&width=512&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=464)

\section*{COMPLICATION THAT MAY ARISE LATER.}
* Infection.
\$ Loosening and wearing of prosthetic components.

\section*{METABOLIC BONE DISORDERS.}

These are disorders that result from
- An inappropriate function of the parathyroid gland
- Vitamin deficiency
- Estrogen deficiency
- Malabsorption syndrome

These conditions include:-
- Osteoporosis
- Osteomalacia
- Paget's disease

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS}

It is a term used to refer to any condition that causes reduction in the mass of bone per unit volume. Most often is used to describe its primary type which is an age related metabolic bone disease in which there is severe reduction in the skeletal bone mass and increased susceptibility to fractures. In this case bone resorption occurs faster than bone formation i.e. osteoclastic activity is higher than the osteoblastic activity. It occurs mainly on the bones of the wrist, hip and vertebral column. It has two main types;-

\section*{Primary type}

This is postmenopausal osteoporosis and is the most common. It has association with underlying medical condition.

\section*{Secondary type}

Occurs with underlying medical condition e.g. hyperparathyroidism or an iatrogenic cause e.g. long term corticosteroid or heparin administration.

Risks factors of osteoporosis.
They are divided into two
I. Individual risk factors.
- Increased age
- Family history
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-39.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)
- Female gender
- Low weight and body mass index.
- Estrogen deficiency or menopause.
- Calcitonin deficiency
- Hyperthyroidism
- High anticoagulant doses
- Coexisting medical conditions (e.g. celiac disease) and medications e.g. (corticosteroids).
II. Life style risk factors.
- Cigarette smoking/ heavy caffeine intake/ alcohol abuse
- Lack of weight bearing exercise.
- Lack of exposure to sunshine.
- Diet low in calcium and vitamin D

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Normally through out a lifespan new bone is formed (osteoblastic activity) while old bone is resorbed (osteoclastic). The peak bone mass is at the age of 30-35 years of age. After this there is a decrease in calcium deposition and osteoblastic activity with age. This coupled with a decrease in estrogen production of menopause the end result is a decrease in bone mass and density. These bones become weak and prone to fractures

\section*{Clinical manifestations}
- Shortened stature
- Difficulties in bending
- Marked kyphosis of the thoracic spine (Dowager's hump)
- Back pain
- Proximal femur fractures especially of the femoral neck.
- Fracture of the distal radius

\section*{Management}

Intervention in the care of the client focuses on symptoms expressed. Important goals include
$\checkmark$ Adequate nutrition especially foods rich in calcium and vitamin D.
$\checkmark$ Exposure to sunlight to enable production of vitamin D.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-40.jpg?height=438&width=512&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=464)
$\checkmark$ Mobility in a hazard free environment.
$\checkmark$ Pain management with NSAIDS
$\checkmark$ Calcium supplements may be necessary e.g. citrocal but monitor for side effects like abdominal distension and constipation.
$\checkmark$ Calcitonin hormone therapy where it is feasible- it suppresses bone loss through direct action on osteoclasts and reduces bone turn over.
$\checkmark$ Estrogen hormone replacement therapy to reduce bone resorption
$\checkmark$ To promote use of a firm mattress, bedrest, knee flexion, back rubs, good posture, corset
$\checkmark$ Gradually resume activities and avoid strenuous lifting and sudden bending

\section*{Prevention}

It focuses on the following areas:-
- Lifestyle- smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake.
- Exercise- achieving a higher peak bone mass through exercise.
- Nutrition- proper nutrition includes a diet sufficient in calcium and vitamin D- is necessary for calcium absorption and for normal bone mineralization.

Protein is required for calcium absorption but excessive protein consumption inhibits this process.

\section*{PAGET'S DISEASE (OSTEITIS DEFORMANS)}

It is a disorder of localized rapid bone turnover, mostly affecting the skull, femur, tibia, pelvic bone and vertebrae

\section*{Etiology}

\section*{Viral}

Paget's disease may be caused by a slow virus infection (i.e., paramyxoviridae) present for many years before symptoms appear. Associated viral infections include respiratory syncytial virus, canine distemper virus, and the measles virus. However, recent evidence has cast some doubt upon the measles association. Laboratory contamination may have played role in past studies linking paramyxovirus (e.g. measles) to Paget's disease.

\section*{Genetic}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-41.jpg?height=438&width=515&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=462)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}

There is a hereditary factor in the development of Paget's disease of bone. Two genes, SQSTM1 and RANK, and specific regions of chromosome 5 and 6 are associated with Paget's disease of bone. Genetic causes may or may not involve a family history of Paget's disease.

\section*{Pathophisiology}

Paget's disease is described in 4 stages:
1. Osteoclastic activity
2. Mixed osteoclastic - osteoblastic activity
3. Osteoblastic activity
4. Malignant degeneration

Initially, there is a marked increase in the rate of bone resorption in localized areas, caused by large and numerous osteoclasts. These localized areas of pathological destruction of bone tissue (osteolysis) are seen radiologically as an advancing lytic wedge in long bones or the skull. When this occurs in the skull, it is called osteoporosis circumscripta. The osteolysis is followed by a compensatory increase in bone formation induced by the bone forming cells, called osteoblasts, that are recruited to the area. This is associated with accelerated deposition of lamellar bone in a disorganized fashion. This intense cellular activity produces a chaotic picture of trabecular bone ("mosaic" pattern), rather than the normal linear lamellar pattern. The resorbed bone is replaced and the marrow spaces are filled by an excess of fibrous connective tissue with a marked increase in blood vessels, causing the bone to become hypervascular. The bone hypercellularity may then diminish, leaving a dense "pagetic bone," also known as burned-out Paget's disease.

Sir James Paget first suggested the disease was due to an inflammatory process. Some evidence suggests that a paramyxovirus infection is the underlying cause of Paget's disease, which may support the possible role of inflammation in the pathogenesis. However, no infectious virus has yet been isolated as a causative agent, and Further research is therefore necessary.

\section*{Clinical manifestations}

Usually asymptomatic and diagnosis is made when radiographic investigations are carried out after traumatic experience. For the symptomatic cases the presenting features include
- Pain in the lower limbs
- Frequent fractures
- Waddling gait
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-42.jpg?height=438&width=515&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=462)
- Skull becomes enlarged so that the face looks small and triangular in shape
- Barrel shaped chest
- Kyphosis
- Symptoms related to nerve compression.
- Hypercalcaemia, hypercalciuria
- increased temperature in the affected bone because of high bone vascularity

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}

Paget's disease may be diagnosed using one or more of the following tests:
- Pagetic bone has a characteristic appearance on X-rays. A skeletal survey is therefore indicated.
- An elevated level of alkaline phosphatase in the blood in combination with normal calcium, phosphate, and aminotransferase levels in an elderly patient are suggestive of Paget's disease.
- Markers of bone turnover in urine eg. Pyridinoline
- Elevated levels of serum and urinary hydroxyproline are also found.
- Bone scans are useful in determining the extent and activity of the condition. If a bone scan suggests Paget's disease, the affected bone(s) should be X-rayed to confirm the diagnosis.

\section*{Management}
$\checkmark$ Pain management with analgesics usually NSAIDs.
$\checkmark$ Asymptomatic patients may be managed with diet adequate in calcium and vitamin D
$\checkmark$ Gait problems from bowing of the legs are managed with walking aids, shoe lifts and physical therapy.
$\checkmark$ Calcitonin hormone therapy -retards bone resecretion by decreasing the number and availability of osteoclasts.

Also facilitates remodeling of abnormal bone into normal.
Reliefs' pain.
Helps to alleviate neurologic and biochemical signs and symptoms.

\section*{Side effects}
* Flushing of the faceand nausea
$\checkmark$ Plicamycin - a cytotoxic antibiotic may be used to control the disease
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-43.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)
$\checkmark$ Biphosphanates also produce rapid reduction in bone turnover and relief pain. They also help reduce serum alkaline phosphates and urinary hydroxyproline levels:- administer without food coz it reduces absorption
$\checkmark$ Definitive orthopedic management incase of fractures occurring

\section*{OSTEOMALACIA}

Is the softening of the bones caused by defective bone mineralization secondary to inadequate levels of available phosphate and calcium, or because of overactive resorption of calcium from the bone which can be caused by hyperparathyroidism (which causes hypercalcemia). Osteomalacia in children is known as rickets, and because of this, use of the term "osteomalacia" is often restricted to the milder, adult form of the disease. Signs and symptoms can include diffuse body pains, muscle weakness, and fragility of the bones.

This is a condition whereby bones become abnormally soft because of a disturbed calcium and phosphorus balance due to vitamin D deficiency. It results in marked deformity of the weight bearing bones and pathologic fractures. It is the adult form of rickets its characterized by inadequate bone mineralization

\section*{Features}
- Bones become flat and bent showing features of scoliosis and kyphosis
- Pathogenic fractures
- Rheumatic pains of the limbs, thorax, pelvis
- Anaemia
- Diffuse joint and bone pain (especially of spine, pelvis, and legs)
- Muscle weakness
- Difficulty walking, often with waddling gait
- Hypocalcemia (positive Chvostek sign)
- Compressed vertebrae and diminished stature
- Pelvic flattening
- Weak, soft bone
- Bending of bones

\section*{CAUSES}

The causes of adult osteomalacia are varied, but ultimately result in a vitamin D deficiency:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-44.jpg?height=438&width=515&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=462)
- Insufficient nutritional quantities or faulty metabolism of vitamin D or phosphorus
- Renal tubular acidosis
- Malnutrition during pregnancy
- Malabsorption syndrome
- Hypophosphatemia
- Chronic kidney failure
- Tumor-induced osteomalacia
- Long-term anticonvulsant therapy
- Celiac disease
- Cadmium poisoning, Itai-itai disease

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{Biochemical findings}

Biochemical features are similar to those of rickets. The major factor is an abnormally low vitamin D concentration in blood serum.

Major typical biochemical findings include: ${ }^{[10]}$
- Low serum and urinary calcium
- Low serum phosphate, except in cases of renal osteodystrophy
- Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (due to an increase in compensatory osteoblast activity)
- Elevated parathyroid hormone (due to low calcium)

\section*{Management}
- Administration of vitamin D 1600 I.U. daily until signs of healing appear (about 1 month) then the dose is reduced to 400 I.U. maintenance dose until the symptoms disappear
- Supplementation of calcium may be necessary
- Intake of a diet high in calcium, vitamin D and protein is provided if it is dietary in origin.
- Patient is instructed on dietary sources of calcium and vitamin D e.g. fortified milk, cereals, eggs, chicken and liver.
- Exposure to sunlight for ultraviolet radiation to transform a cholesterol substance present in the skin into vitamin D may be recommended.
- Deformities can be treated with braces or surgery

\section*{OSTEOMYELITIS}

This is a term use to describe any infection of the bones that results in inflammation, necrosis and formation of a new bone.

It is divided into the following classes
Acute: - responds to antibiotic treatment for 4-6 weeks
Chronic: - persists longer than 4 weeks and involves sequestered (necrotic bone that has separated from the living) areas of infection.

Hematogenous osteomyelitis:-due to bloodborne spread infection
Contiguous-focus osteomyelitis: from contamination after bone surgery,open fracture or traumatic injury

\section*{Who Gets Osteomyelitis?}

Only 2 out of every 10,000 people get osteomyelitis. The condition affects children and adults, although in different ways. Certain conditions and behaviors that weaken the immune system increase a person's risk for osteomyelitis, including:
- Diabetes (most cases of osteomyelitis stem from diabetes)
- Sickle cell disease
- HIV or AIDS
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Intravenous drug use
- Alcoholism
- Long-term use of steroids
- Hemodialysis
- Poor blood supply
- Recent injury

Bone surgery, including hip and knee replacements, also increase the chance of bone infection.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY.}

It is of bacterial origin mainly, mostly staph aureus which causes $70-80 \%$ of bone infection. Other pathogenic organisms frequently found in osteomyelitis include proteus and pseudomonas species and E. coli.

The initial response to infection is inflammation, increase vascularity and edema. After 2-3days thrombosis of the blood vessels occurs in the area resulting in ischemia with bone necrosis. The infection extends into the medullary
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-46.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}
cavity and under the periosteum and may spread into adjacent soft tissue and joints. Unless the infective process is treated promptly a bone abscess forms. The resulting abscess cavity contains dead bone tissue which does not easily liquefy and drain(microorganisms may infect bone through one or more of three basic methods: via the bloodstream, contiguously from local areas of infection (as in cellulitis), or penetrating trauma, including iatrogenic causes such as joint replacements or internal fixation of fractures or root-canaled teeth. Once the bone is infected, leukocytes enter the infected area, and, in their attempt to engulf the infectious organisms, release enzymes that lyse the bone. Pus spreads into the bone's blood vessels, impairing their flow, and areas of devitalized infected bone, known as sequestra, form the basis of a chronic infection. Often, the body will try to create new bone around the area of necrosis. The resulting new bone is often called an involucrum)

\section*{Clinical manifestations}
- Fever /chills
- Localized pain ;that can be described as pulsating pain and there is guarded movement of the infected area
- Erythema (redness)
- Swelling, warmness of the affected area
- Rapid pulse.
- Purulent drainage
- Non healing ulcer that overlies the infected bone
- General malaise.

Fever, irritability, fatigue
Nausea
Wenderness, redness, and warmth in the area of the infection
Swelling around the affected bone
$=$ Lost range of motion

\section*{Diagnosis}
- Increased white blood cell count
- X-ray show soft tissue swelling in acute ostoemyelitis and large irregular cavities in chronic cases
- Increased ESR
- Blood culture
- Positive blood culture indicating bacteremia
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-47.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{Management}

Main goal is to control and halt the infective process, relief pain ,improve physical mobility and enhance knowledge on treatment regimen.
$\checkmark$ Parenteral administration of antibiotic like:-
Penicillins
- Lincosamides - lincomycin- 500 mg TID $/ 30-60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ daily in divided doses
- Clindamycin150-450 mg QID/3-6mg/kg QID
- Cephalosporins e.g. Ceftriaxone (Rocephine) 4 mg OD
$\checkmark$ Chronic osteomyelitis may require surgical removal of the dead bone (sequestrectomy) and removal of the scar or infected tissue leaving a saucer like space (saucerization). This is followed by 4-6 weeks of i.v antibiotics then oral antibiotic.

\section*{RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS}

Inflammation of the joint is known as arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, systemic, progressive, inflammatory connective tissue disorder affecting mainly the small, peripheral joints in a pattern of symmetric distribution.

\section*{Etiology}

It is unknown but it is genetically predisposed and it is thought to be an autoimmune disease.

\section*{Pathophysiology.}

In RA the autoimmune reaction primarily occurs in the synovial tissues, phagocytosis produces enzymes within the joint. The enzyme breaks down collagen, causing edema, proliferation of the synovial membrane and ultimately Pannus formation. Pannus destroys cartilage and erodes the bone. The consequence is loss of articular surfaces and joint motion. Muscle fiber undergoes degenerative changes tendons and ligament elasticity and contractile power are lost.

\section*{Manifestations}
-A client typically has periods of increased and severe symptoms and times of relative comfort and remission.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-48.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

During an acute exacerbation, the symptoms that occur include-;
- Red swollen, stiff, and tender joints, the palms may be reddened and the dorsal veins enlarged
- Limited range of movement
- Prodromol signs include
- Vague articular pain and stiffness
- Malaise
- Weight loss
- Numbness of the hands and feet
- Fever.
- Anemia.
- swelling

Symptoms are typically worse in the morning and subside during the day.
Pain varies in intensity.
Others include:- enlarged spleen, enlarged lymph nodes, anorexia, weakness, depression. With advanced disease, ocular manifestations may arise.
The causes of an acute attack/exacerbation are
1. Anxiety
2. Exposure to temperature extremes
3. Overwork
4. Acute infections

\section*{Diagnosis}
- Presence of rheumatoid factor in blood and synovial fluid
- Increased ESR
- Increased WBC
- Splenomegaly with leucopenia may be present.

\section*{Medical management}

Goals
- Prevention of joint deformity
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-49.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)
- Preservation of joint function
- Reduction of inflammation and pain

It is usually supportive
$\checkmark$ NSAIDs especially salicylates like aspirin which block the enzyme involved in inflammatory process.
$\checkmark$ Rest
$\checkmark$ Physical therapy
$\checkmark$ If severe deformities resulting in inability to meet activities of daily living limited surgery may be necessary- joint replacement.
$\checkmark$ Local pain may be sorted by applying heat in some clients or cold in others.
$\checkmark$ Massage, but not on actively inflamed joints because it can worsen, may relieve pain and muscle spasm
$\checkmark$ Corticosteroid may relieve it but risks out weigh the benefits
$\checkmark$ Intralesional corticosteroids may relieve symptoms but fluid has to be removed first before injection. Never administer incase of infection.
$\checkmark$ Antimalarials, Gold salts and D Penicillamine have been found to have an inhibitory effect on RA progression although onset off action is slow 91-8 weeks) so prolonged use is necessary. These drugs may lead to lead to leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, proteinuria and skin rashes.
$\checkmark$ An Immunosuppressive (cytoxic) agent e.g. methotraxate may also be administered to reduce the inflammation.
$\checkmark$ Nutrition therapy should be rich in vitamins, protein, and iron for tissue building and repair.
The nursing care will be aimed at
- Relieving pain
- Correcting knowledge deficit
- Promoting rest

\section*{GOUTY ARTHRITIS}

Primary gout is a familial metabolic disorder of purine metabolism which results in abnormal amounts of urate in the body. Normally referred to as the disease of the rich. Purines are products of protein synthesis whose excess may lead to inadequate metabolism. The result is accumulation of the products of incomplete metabolism, uric
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-50.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)
acid. When this uric acid accumulates in blood it is precipitated to form crystals and deposited in various places in the body to include:-
- The kidney as stones
- Joints

The deposited crystals behave like foreign bodies and stimulate an inflammatory response at the area of deposition. In the case of joints gouty arthritis ensues. Thus the main clinical problem is recurrent attacks of arthritis in which case a client is totally incapacitated. Mostly it affects_great toe, knee, the small joints of the feet and hands, the wrist and elbow. It occurs more in male than female

\section*{Risk factors}
- Obesity
- Renal insufficiency
- Hypertension
- Alcohol ingestion
- Lead ingestion
- Trauma
- Prolonged use of medication interfere with renal excreation of uric acid e.g. diuretics, cytotoxic drugs

\section*{Symptoms}
- Acute periodic episodes of pain, swelling of a joint, mainly those of the foot (ankle, insteps or great toe)
- Tophi may recur in various regions (nodular deposits of sodium urate crystals) including joints, subcutaneous tissues, tendons, cartilage and kidneys.
- During an acute attack urate crystals are found in synovial tissues causing synovitis resulting in acute functional disturbances
- Other symptoms include, headache, tachycardia, fever and malaise

\section*{Lab findings}
- Increased WBC and ESR
- Increased uric acid in blood
- Presence of Na urate in synovial fluid or tophi.

- Progressive renal dysfunction is the threat to life

\section*{Management}
$\checkmark$ Acute attack
- Colchicine - lowers the deposition of uric acid and interfers with leukocytes and kinnin formation thus reducing inflammation.
- Bed rest
- Analgesics e.g. codeine
- Hot or cold compresses
- Fluid decrease precipitation in the kidneys
$\checkmark$ Between attack treatment is aimed at reducing frequency and severity of attacks and minimize deposition of the urate crystal. These is achieved by
- Daily administration of colchicines indefinitely
- Other uricosuric agents e.g. Probenecid, salicylates (salicylates should never be given together with other agents because they inactivate them) inhibits renal reabsorption of urates and increases the urinary excretion of uric acid thus preventing tophi. NB: Be alert of nausea, rash and constipation.
- Xanthine oxidase inhibitors e.g. allopurinol they interrupt the breakdown of purines before uric acid is formed. NB: side effects include bone marrow depression, vomiting and abdominal pain.
- Fluid intake at least 3litres per day
- Dietary management
- Avoiding acidity and dehydration
- Decrease purine in diet until serum levels are normal i.e. avoid meat and sweet bread.
- Avoid alcohol because it can precipitate an attack
- Maintenance of normal weight.

With large tophi in advanced gout, surgical removal may be necessary to correct deformity and reduce the load on renal function.

\section*{OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-52.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI and sometimes known as brittle bone disease, or "Lobstein syndrome is a congenital bone disorder. People with OI are born with defective connective tissue, or without the ability to make it, usually because of a deficiency of Type-I collagen. This deficiency arises from an amino acid substitution of glycine to bulkier amino acids in the collagen triple helix structure. As a genetic disorder, OI has historically been viewed as an autosomal dominant disorder of type I collagen. Most cases have been caused by mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes.

\section*{TYPES}

\section*{Type I}

Blue sclera in osteogenesis imperfecta.
- Collagen is of normal quality but is produced in insufficient quantities:
- Bones fracture easily
- Slight spinal curvature
- Loose joints
- Poor muscle tone
- Discoloration of the sclera (whites of the eyes), usually giving them a blue-gray color. The blue-gray color of the sclera is due to the underlying choroidal veins which show through. This is due to the sclera being thinner than normal because of the defective Type I collagen not forming correctly.
- Early loss of hearing in some children
- Slight protrusion of the eyes

\section*{Type II}

Collagen is not of a sufficient quality or quantity
- Most cases die within the first year of life due to respiratory failure or intracerebral hemorrhage
- Severe respiratory problems due to underdeveloped lungs
- Severe bone deformity and small stature

Type II can be further subclassified into groups A, B, C, which are distinguished by radiographic evaluation of the long bones and ribs. Type IIA demonstrates broad and short long bones with broad and beaded ribs. Type IIB
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-53.jpg?height=438&width=512&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=464)
demonstrates broad and short long bones with thin ribs that have little or no beading. Type IIC demonstrates thin and longer long bones with thin and beaded ribs.

\section*{Type III}

Collagen improperly formed. Enough collagen is made but it is defective
- Bones fracture easily, sometimes even before birth
- Bone deformity, often severe
- Respiratory problems possible
- Short stature, spinal curvature and sometimes barrel-shaped rib cage
- Triangular face
- Loose joints(double jointed)
- Poor muscle tone in arms and legs
- Discolouration of the sclera (the 'whites' of the eyes are blue)
- Early loss of hearing possible

Type III is distinguished among the other classifications as being the "Progressive Deforming" type, wherein a neonate presents with mild symptoms at birth and develops the aforementioned symptoms throughout life. Lifespan may be normal, albeit with severe physical handicapping.

\section*{Type IV}

Collagen quantity is sufficient but is not of a high enough quality
- Bones fracture easily, especially before puberty
- Short stature, spinal curvature and barrel-shaped rib cage
- Bone deformity is mild to moderate
- Early loss of hearing

Similar to Type I, Type IV can be further subclassified into types IVA and IVB characterized by absence (IVA) or presence (IVB) of dentinogenesis imperfecta.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-54.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{Type V}

Same clinical features as Type IV. Distinguished histologically by "mesh-like" bone appearance. Further characterized by the "V Triad" consisting of a) radio-opaque band adjacent to growth plates, b) hypertrophic calluses at fracture sites, and c) calcification of the radio-ulnar interosseous membrane

OI Type V leads to calcification of the membrane between the two forearm bones, making it difficult to turn the wrist. Another symptom is abnormally large amounts of repair tissue (hyperplasic callus) at the site of fractures. Other features of this condition include radial head dislocation, long bone bowing and mixed hearing loss.

At leastb some cases of this type are caused by mutations in the interferon induced transmembrane protein 5 (IFITM5) gene.

\section*{Type VI}

Same clinical features as Type IV. Distinguished histologically by "fish-scale" bone appearance. Type VI has recently been found to be caused by a loss of function mutation in the Serpin F1 gene. Serpin F1, a member of the serpin family is also known as pigment epithelium derived factor PEDF, the most powerful endogenous antiangiogenic factor in mammals.

\section*{Type VII}

In 2006 a recessive form called "Type VII" was discovered (Phenotype severe to lethal). Thus far it seems to be limited to a First Nations people in Quebec. Mutations in the gene CRTAP causes this type.

Although Type VII is indeed associated with First Nations people in Northern Quebec, the reference cited in this review is not supportive of that fact. It doesn't mention anything about First Nations, aboriginal, Native American, American Indian, or indigenous peoples.

\section*{Type VIII}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-55.jpg?height=441&width=512&top_left_y=122&top_left_x=464)

OI caused by mutation in the gene LEPRE1 is classified as type VIII.

\section*{Treatment}

At present there is no cure for OI. Treatment is aimed at increasing overall bone strength to prevent fracture and maintain mobility.
- There have been many clinical trials performed with Fosamax (Alendronate), a drug used to treat those experiencing brittleness of bones due to osteoporosis. Higher levels of effectiveness apparently are to be seen in the pill form versus the IV form, but results seem inconclusive. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will not approve Fosamax as a treatment for OI because long term effects of the drug have not been fully researched yet, although it is often used in preteens, instead of Pamidronate.
- Regular weight-bearing exercise, a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, a healthy lifestyle, and, in some cases, vitamin supplements will help off-set early development of osteoporosis, prevent future fractures, and delay other health concerns related to OI.
- Bone infections are treated as and when they occur with the appropriate antibiotics and antiseptics.
- Physiotherapy used to strengthen muscles and improve motility in a gentle manner, while minimizing the risk of fracture. This often involves hydrotherapy and the use of support cushions to improve posture. Individuals are encouraged to change positions regularly throughout the day in order to balance the muscles which are being used and the bones which are under pressure.

Children often develop a fear of trying new ways of moving due to movement being associated with pain. This can make physiotherapy difficult to administer to young children.
- Physical aids With adaptive equipment such as crutches, wheelchairs, splints, grabbing arms, and/or modifications to the home many individuals with OI can obtain a significant degree of autonomy.
- Bisphosphonates(BPs), particularly those containing nitrogen, are being increasingly administered to increase bone mass and reduce the incidence of fracture.
- Surgery. Metal rods can be surgically inserted in the long bones to improve strength, a procedure developed by Harold A. Sofield, MD, at Shriners Hospitals for Children in Chicago.

\section*{COMMON MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS.}

\section*{Acute low back pain.}

Low back pain occurs in the low lumbar, lumbosacral or sacro iliac areas.

\section*{CAUSES.}

It can be caused by a large variety of conditions. Most low back pain is caused by
1. Musculoskeletal problems e.g. acute lumbosacral strain, unstable lumbosacral ligaments and weak muscles.
2. kidney disorders
3. Pelvic problems
4. Retroperitoneal tumors
5. Abdominal aneurysms
6. Psychosomatic problems.
7. In additional obesity, stress and occasionally depression contribute to low back pain.

Back pain can occur from:-
i. Ruptured vertebral disk or herniation of the nucleus pulposus
ii. Back or pelvis fractures, tumors or infections
iii. Inflammation such as ankylosing sponylitis :- break down of a vertebra
iv. Congenital back deformities
v. Muscle spasms associated with strain or sprain.
vi. Back strain from stretched abdominal muscles due to obesity or pregnancy.

\section*{Clinical features}
* Patient complain of either acute or chronic back pain lasting for more than 3 months without improvement
* Fatigue
* Patient may report pain radiating down the leg which is known as sciatica / radiculopathy which suggests nerve involvement.
* Patients gait, spinal mobility, reflexes, leg length, leg motor strength and sensory perception may be altered
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-57.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{Diagnostic procedures.}
* x-ray of spine:- may demonstrate a fracture, dislocation, infection or scoliosis
* Bone scan and blood studies:- may disclose infections, tumors and bone marrow abnormalities
* Magnetic resonance imaging: - permits visualization of the nature and location of spinal pathology.
* Computer tomography: - useful in identifying underlying problems such as soft tissue lesions.

\section*{Prevention}
- Proper posture
- Strong abdominal and leg muscles exercises
- Using proper lifting techniques
- Keeping oneself in good physical condition.

Management.
- Stretching exercises.
- Bed rest is recommended for 1-2 days with maximum of 4 days only if pain is severe.
- Wearing shoes with support and cushioning to relieve pain.
- Orthotic devices can be used.
- Analgesics such as NSAIDs eg panadol and brufen may reduce the pain
- Traction is occasionally needed to relive muscle spasms but bed rest is sufficient.
- Application of heat and ice provides temporary relief of symptoms
- In absence of symptoms of disease manipulation of root nerves may be helpful.
- Twisting, bending, lifting and reaching all of which stresses the back are avoided.

\section*{COMMON PROBLEMS OF THE UPPER EXTRIMITY.}

\section*{Bursitis and tendinitis}

They are inflammatory conditions that commonly occur in the shoulder. Buresae are fluid filled sacs that prevent friction between joint structures during joint activity. When inflamed they are painful. Similarly, muscle tendon sheaths became inflamed with repetitive stretching. The inflammation causes proliferation of synovial membrane and Pannus formation, which restricts joint movement.

\section*{Management}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-58.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}

Conservative treatment includes: - rest of extremity, intermittent ice and heat to the joint and NSAIDs to control the pain and inflammation.

\section*{Loose bodies}

They may occur in a joint as a result of articular cartilage wear and bone erosion, these fragments interfere with joint movement, locking the joint and cause painful movements. Loose bodies are removed by arthroscopic surgery.

\section*{Ganglion.}

It is a round firm projection, usually near the wrist. It is a collection of gelatinous material near the tendon sheaths and joints. It is caused by strains, contusions or a series or repeated minor strains as a result of which the tissues of the sheath or sac involved have gradually become weakened and distended. The ganglion is painless, but an affected joint is often weak and moderately painful secondary to local pressure.

\section*{Treatment}
- Aspiration or excision.
- Aspiration decompression may need to be repeated since fluid may accumulate.

\section*{Carpal tunnel syndrome}

It is an entrapment neuropathy caused by pressure from a thickened flexor tendon sheath, skeletal encroachment or soft tissue mass on the median nerve at the wrist.

Signs and symptoms
Numbness, pain, paresthesia and possible weakness along the median nerve (thumb, first and second fingers)

\section*{Management}
- Rest splint
- Avoidance of work that requires flexion of the wrist may relieve the symptoms.
- Surgical release of the transverse carpal ligament may be necessary.

\section*{Dupuytren's contracture.}

It is a slowly progressive contracture of the palmer fascia causing flexion of the little finger, the ring finger and frequently the middle fingers; which renders them more or less useless.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-59.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}

It starts as thickening of the palmer fascia. The fibrous thickening extends to involve the skin in the distal palm and produces a contracture of the finger to which the palmer fascia is inserted.

\section*{Risk factors}
- People of Scandinavian or Northern European ancestry; it has been called the "Viking disease" or "Celtic hand", though it is also widespread in some Mediterranean countries (e.g., Spain and Bosnia) and in Japan;
- Men rather than women (men are ten times as likely to develop the condition);
- People over the age of 40;
- People with a family history ( $60 \%$ to $70 \%$ of those afflicted have a genetic predisposition to Dupuytren's contracture);
- People with liver cirrhosis.
- Some suspected, but unproven, causes of Dupuytren's contracture include trauma, diabetes, alcoholism, epilepsy therapy with phenytoin, and liver disease.

\section*{Tennis elbow}

It is a painful condition that is due to excessive pronation and supination activities of the forearm. The pain characteristically radiates down the extensor surface of the forearm.

\section*{READ AND MAKE NOTE ON FOOT DEFORMITIES}

\section*{BONE TUMORS}

Bone tumors occur commonly in children and adolescents but less common in older adults.
- In older adults is most commonly the result of metastatic spread from another tumor.
- Characterized by rapid metastasis \& bone destruction
- Common indication for amputation
- There are many different types of bone cancer, The most common primary bone tumors include osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, chondrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosarcoma, and chordoma.
- There are various types of benign bone tumors. These include osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma, osteochondroma, enchondroma, chondromyxoid fibroma, aneurysmal bone cyst, unicameral bone cyst, and giant cell tumor (which has the potential to become malignant). As with other types of benign tumors, these are not cancerous.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-60.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}

Two other relatively common types of cancer than develop in the bones: lymphoma and multiple myeloma
- Osteosarcoma:-_most common primary malignant bone cancer. Commonly affects males between 10-25 years old but can attack older adults even. It often occurs in the long bones of the arms and legs at areas of rapid growth around the knees and shoulders of children. This type of cancer is often very aggressive with risk of spread to the lungs. The five-year survival rate is about $65 \%$.
- Ewing's sarcoma:- is the most aggressive bone tumor and affects younger people between 4-15 years of age. It is more common in males and is very rare in people over 30 years of age. It most commonly occurs in the middle of the long bones of the arms and legs. The three-year survival rate is about $65 \%$, but this rate is much lower if there has been spread to the lungs or other tissues of the body.
- Chondrosarcoma:- is the second most common bone tumor and accounts for about $25 \%$ of all malignant bone tumors. These tumors arise from the cartilage cells and can either be very aggressive or relatively slow growing. Unlike many other bone tumors, chondrosarcoma is most common in people over 40 years of age. It is slightly more common in males and can potentially spread to the lungs and lymph nodes. Chondrosarcoma most commonly affects the bones of the pelvis and hips. The five-year survival for the aggressive form is about $30 \%$, but the survival rate for slow-growing tumors is $90 \%$.
- Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH):- affects the soft tissues, including muscle, ligaments, tendons, and fat. It is the most common soft-tissue malignancy in later adult life, usually occurring in people 50-60 years of age. It most commonly affects the extremities and is about twice as common in males as females. MFH also has a wide range of severity. The overall five-year survival rate is about $35 \%-60 \%$.
- Fibrosarcoma:- is much more rare than the other bone tumors. It is most common in people 35-55 years of age. It most commonly affects the soft tissues of the leg behind the knee. Slightly more common in males
- Chordoma :- is a very rare tumor with an average survival of about six years after diagnosis. It occurs in adults over 30 years of age and is about twice as common in males as females. It most commonly affects either the lower or upper end of the spinal column.
- Lymphoma, a cancer arising from the cells of the immune system, usually begins in the lymph nodes but can begin in the bone.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-61.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)
- Multiple myeloma begins in the bones, but it is not usually considered a bone tumor because it is a tumor of the bone marrow cells and not of the bone cells.

\section*{Causes}
- Exposure to therapeutic radiations but not other radiations
- Genetic influences \& familial tendencies
- Hormonal imbalances \& growth spurts
- Adults with hyperparathyroidism, paget's and chronic osteomyelitis
- Trauma and sites of old bone infarcts or fractures
- Multiple exostoses (overgrowth of bone tissue)
- Benign bone tumors and bone marrow transplants
- Treatment with some chemotherapeutic drugs
- Young age (risk factor)

\section*{Clinical features}
- Pain:- In most cases, the symptoms become gradually more severe with time. Initially, the pain may only be present either at night or with activity. Depending on the growth of the tumor, those affected may have symptoms for weeks, months, or years before seeking medical advice.
- In some cases, a mass or lump may be felt either on the bone or in the tissues surrounding the bone. This is most common with MFH or fibrosarcoma but can occur with other bone tumors.
- The bones can become weakened by the tumor and lead to a fracture after little or no trauma or just from standing on the affected bone. This can occur with both benign and malignant tumors. Even benign tumors can spread locally and weaken the surrounding bone.
- If the tumor compresses the surrounding nerve it can cause pain, numbness, or tingling in the extremities.
- If the surrounding blood vessels are compressed, it can affect the blood flow to the extremities.
- Fever, chills, night sweats, and weight loss can occur but are less common. These symptoms are more common after spread of the tumor to other tissues in the body.

\section*{Diagnosis}
- Take a complete medical history:- gives clues on diagnosis. Some types of cancer have familial tendency while others are more common in people with certain lifestyles e.g. smoking.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-62.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}
- A complete physical examination to include testing the muscle strength, sensation to touch, and reflexes to help find the cause of the symptoms
- Certain blood tests can be ordered that can help to identify a possible cancer.
- Imaging studies:- to help determine the type of cancer or to identify if a fracture has occurred or if the bone has been weakened and is at risk for a potential fracture.
- C.T Scan:-gives cross-sectional images, is better able to identify a possible tumor and gives additional information on the size and location of the tumor.
- M.R.Is:- provides cross sectional imaging of the body. It provides better detail of the soft tissues, including muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, and blood vessels than a CT scan. This test can give better detail on whether or not the bone tumor has broken through the bone and involved the surrounding soft tissues or not.
- A bone scan:-_identifies areas of rapidly growing or remodeling bone $\&$ is often taken of the entire body. It may be ordered to identify any other areas of bone involvement throughout the body. It is not specific for any specific type of tumor and can be positive with many other conditions including infection, fracture, and arthritis.
- Biopsy of a sample of the tumor:- the biopsy can be obtained either through a needle biopsy or incision biopsy. Imaging studies will be used to determine the safest and easiest location of biopsy

\section*{Management}
- The best treatment is based on:-
$\checkmark$ The type of bone cancer.
$\checkmark$ The location of the cancer.
$\checkmark$ How aggressive the cancer is.
$\checkmark$ Whether or not the cancer has metastasized or not

\section*{Main types of treatment}
- Surgery
- Chemotherapy
- Radiation therapy
N.B These can be used either individually or combined with each other.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-63.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{Surgery}
- The goal of surgery is usually to remove the entire tumor and a surrounding area of normal bone.
- Historically amputations were frequently used to remove bone cancer.
- In many cases, the tumor can be removed with a rim of normal bone without the need for an amputation.
- Depending on the amount of bone removed, the surgeon will replace something in its location. For smaller areas, this may be either bone cement or a bone graft from another place in your body or from the bone bank. For larger areas, the surgeon may place larger grafts from the bone bank or metal implants. Some of these metal implants have the ability to lengthen when used in growing children.

\section*{Chemotherapy}
- This is the use of various medications used to try to stop the growth of the cancer cells.
- Chemotherapy can be used prior to surgery to try to shrink the bone tumor to make surgery easier.
- It can also be used after surgery to try to kill any remaining cancer cells left following surgery.

\section*{Radiation}
- Uses high-energy X-ray aimed at the site of the cancer to try to kill the cancer cells. This Rx is given in small doses daily over a period of days to months. As with chemotherapy, radiation therapy can be used either before or after a potential surgery, depending on the specific type of cancer.
- Bone marrow transplant

\section*{AMPUTATION}

It is the removal of a body extremity by trauma or surgery.

\section*{Indications}
1. Peripheral vascular disease:- due to diabetes mellitus causing arterial occlusion
2. Gangrene: - from other causes
3. Neoplasms:- Melanomas or Cancerous bone or soft tissue tumors e.g. osteosarcoma, osteochondroma, fibrosarcoma
4. Trauma:- Severe limb injuries e.g. burns, frost bites, Traumatic amputation or Amputation in utero by amniotic bands
5. Deformities:- affecting the digits and/or limbs or extra digits and/or limbs (e.g. polydactyly)
6. Infection:- Bone infection (osteomyelitis)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-64.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}
7. Legal punishment:- Amputation is used as a legal punishment in a number of countries e.g. Somalia Significance of amputation.
- Relief symptoms.
- Improve function.
\$ Save or improve patient's quality of life.

\section*{Types of Amputation}
- Leg:- Digits, Partial foot amputation, Ankle disarticulation, Below-knee amputation (trans-tibial) Kneebearing amputation, Above knee amputation (trans-femoral), Rotationplasty:- Foot being turned around and reattached to allow the ankle joint to be used as a knee, Hip disarticulation, Hemipelvectomy/ hindquarter amputation
- Arm:- digits, metacarpal, wrist disarticulation, forearm (transradial), elbow disarticulation, aboveelbow(transhumeral), shoulder disarticulation and forequarter amputation

Teeth:- The avulsion of some teeth (mainly incisives) is or was practiced by some cultures for ritual purposes
- Hemicorporectomy or amputation at the waist
- Genital modification and mutilation may involve amputating tissue, although not necessarily as a result of injury or disease

Assement prior to amputation the following factors should be considered
$\checkmark$ Client's physical condition-ischemic gangrene, rest pain, infection, massive injury, malignancy
$\checkmark$ The type of amputation to be done
- Open amputation it is done incases of infection. The wound is left open until infection is healed for drainage, treated with antibiotics and bed rest.
- Closed/flap amputation- is done where there is no infection although drains may be inserted to promote wound healing.
$\checkmark$ The level of the amputation required- should be as distal as it is possible to better prosthesis success.
$\checkmark$ Peripheral vascular function test results
$\checkmark$ The client's general attitude toward amputation- this depends on the age and maturity of the clients. And also whether the pain of losing the leg is better than that of chronic ischemia. Counseling may be required.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-65.jpg?height=438&width=512&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=464)
$\checkmark$ The client's rehabilitation potential and type of prosthesis to be fitted post operatively.

\section*{Nursing care}

\section*{Preoperative}
$\checkmark$ Talk to the client to allay fear and anxiety because of the loss of a limb. Establish open communication and allow the client to express their feelings. If necessary employ the assistance of a social worker or psychologist.
$\checkmark$ Correct the knowledge deficit regarding the amputation and prepare the client for phantom pain/ sensation and also the need for exercise postoperatively.
$\checkmark$ Diabetics are high risk surgical clients and need to be assessed their metabolic status
$\checkmark$ Those with infection given antibiotics and bed rest to promote healing
$\checkmark$ High protein diet and vitamin supplementation
$\checkmark$ If anemic transfusion and hematinics will be necessary
$\checkmark$ Incase of dehydration I.V fluid administration
$\checkmark$ Relieve pain by giving analgesics

\section*{POST OPERATIVE}
- Assess the ABC
- Assess vital signs
- Look for signs of bleeding every 2 hours
- Evaluate the CVS status by checking proximal pulses, skin color and temperature
- manage pain as required - pethidine 50 mg TDS
- Prevent formation of contractures by encouraging the patient to move and do exercise.
- Assist the stump to shrink by encouraging the patient to do stump conditioning exercises and by correctly bandaging the stump. Massage the stump and teach client to do the same
- Edema is controlled by elevating the stump for the 1st 24 hours after surgery. Following that time the stump is placed flat on the bed to reduce hip contractures
- Rehabilitation and prosthesis training with physiotherapist.

\section*{* Stump care to include:-}
$\checkmark$ Daily inspection for signs of irritation
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_11_e8692ea26dfb72f59229g-66.jpg?height=438&width=509&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=468)

\section*{ORTHOPEADIC NURSING}
$\checkmark$ Discontinue the prosthesis if the irritation has occurred
$\checkmark$ Pt to wash with bacteristatic soap, rinse \& dry allowing aeration for 20 minutes before refixing it Rehabilitation:- walking, occupational, psychological

\section*{Complications.}
* Hemorrhage: - this is because the major blood vessels have been disturbed.
* Infection: - risk for infection increases with contaminated wound after traumatic amputation.
* Skin breakdown: - caused by the prosthesis.
* Phantom limb pain: - caused by serving of peripheral nerves.
* Joint contracture: - caused by positioning and protective flexion withdraw pattern associated with pain and muscle imbalance.

\section*{Nursing interventions for the complications.}

Hemorrhage: - monitor the patient for any signs or symptoms of bleeding.
Monitor the patient's vital signs and observe the sunction drainage.
Infection: - administer antibiotics as prescribed.
Monitor the incision, dressing and drainage for indications of infection e.g. change in Color, odor, or consistency of drainage, increasing discomfort.

Monitor for systemic indicators of infection e.g. elevated temperature and prompt report to the surgeon.
Phantom limb pain: - it is more frequently in above knee amputation. The patient describes pain Or unusual sensations such as numbness tingling or muscle cramps as well as a feeling that the extremity is present, crushed cramped or twisted in an abnormal Position.
