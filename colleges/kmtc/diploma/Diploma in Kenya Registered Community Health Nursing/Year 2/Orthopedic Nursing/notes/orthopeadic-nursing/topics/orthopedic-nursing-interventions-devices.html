                        <p>The nurse should be aware of and monitor for specific potential complications associated with total hip replacement. The complication include:-</p>

                            <li>Dislocation of hip prosthesis.</li>

                            <li>Teach the patient about positioning the leg in abduction, which helps to prevent dislocation of the prosthesis. The use of an abduction splint, a wedge pillow or two to three pillows between the legs keeps the hip in abduction.</li>

                        <p>Drainage of 250-500mls in the first 24 hours is expected, by 48 hours postoperatively, the total drainage in 8 hours usually decreases to 30 mls or less and the sunction device is removed. The nurse informs the doctor if any drainage volume greater than anticipated.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preventing deep vein thrombosis.</h4>
                        <p>The incidence of DVT is 45-70% and the peak occurrence is 5-7 days after surgery.</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Encourage active flexion of the foot every hour when the patient is awake. This is to prevent complications like thromboembolism, perineal nerve palsy, infection, limited range of motion.</li>
                            <li>Suction should be done; the drainage ranges from 200-400 ml during the first 24 hours after surgery and diminishes to less than 25 mls by 48 hours. After that the surgeon should be informed to remove the drains.</li>
                            <li>Assist the patient to get out of bed on the evening or the day after surgery.</li>
                            <li>The leg should not be dangled to prevent dislocation</li>
                            <li>The nurse encourages the patient to use the continuous passive motion most of the time. The patients leg is placed in device, which increases circulation and range of motion of the knee joint.</li>
                            <li>After discharge the patient may continue to use the CPM device at home and may undergo physical therapy on out patient basis.</li>

                        <p>Complicated fractures of the humerus, forearm, femur, tibia, and pelvis are managed with external skeletal fixators.</p>
                        <p>The fracture is reduced, aligned, and immobilized by a series of pins inserted in the bone. Pin position is maintained through attachment to a portable frame. The fixator facilitates patient comfort, early mobility, and active exercise of adjacent uninvolved joints. Complications related to disuse and immobility are minimized.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">PROMOTING HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE</h3>
                        <p><strong>Teaching the Patient Self-Care.</strong> The nurse teaches the patient to perform pin site care according to the prescribed protocol and to report promptly any signs of pin site infection: redness, tenderness, increased or purulent pin site drainage, or fever.</p>
                        <p>The nurse also instructs the patient and family to monitor neurovascular status and report any changes promptly. The nurse teaches the patient or family member to check the integrity of the fixator frame daily and to report loose pins or clamps.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">MANAGING THE PATIENT IN TRACTION</h3>
                        <p>Traction is the application of a pulling force to a part of the body. Traction is used to minimize muscle spasms; to reduce, align, and immobilize fractures; to reduce deformity; and to increase space between opposing surfaces.</p>
                        <p>At times, traction needs to be applied in more than one direction to achieve the desired line of pull. When this is done, one of the lines of pull counteracts the other. These lines of pull are known as the vectors of force. The actual resultant pulling force is somewhere between the two lines of pull.</p>
                        <p>Traction is used primarily as a short-term intervention until other modalities, such as external or internal fixation, are possible.</p>
                        <p>This reduces the risk of disuse syndrome and minimizes the length of hospitalization, often allowing the patient to be cared for in the home setting.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE TRACTION</h4>
                        <p>Whenever traction is applied, countertraction must be used to achieve effective traction. Countertraction is the force acting in the opposite direction. Usually, the patient's body weight and bed position adjustments supply the needed countertraction.</p>
                        <p>The following are additional principles to follow when caring for the patient in traction:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Traction must be continuous to be effective in reducing and immobilizing fractures.</li>
                            <li>Skeletal traction is never interrupted.</li>
                            <li>Weights are not removed unless intermittent traction is prescribed.</li>
                            <li>Any factor that might reduce the effective pull or alter its resultant line of pull must be eliminated:</li>
                            <li>The patient must be in good body alignment in the center of the bed when traction is applied.</li>
                            <li>Ropes must be unobstructed.</li>
                            <li>Weights must hang free and not rest on the bed or floor.</li>
                            <li>Knots in the rope or the footplate must not touch the pulley or the foot of the bed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are several types of traction. Straight or running traction applies the pulling force in a straight line with the body part resting on the bed. Buck's extension traction is an example of straight traction. Balanced suspension traction supports the affected extremity off the bed and allows for some patient movement without disruption of the line of pull. Traction may be applied to the skin (skin traction) or directly to the bony skeleton (skeletal traction). The mode of application is determined by the purpose of the traction. Traction can be applied with the hands (manual traction). This is temporary traction that may be used when applying a cast, giving skin care under a Buck's extension foam boot, or adjusting the traction apparatus.</p>
