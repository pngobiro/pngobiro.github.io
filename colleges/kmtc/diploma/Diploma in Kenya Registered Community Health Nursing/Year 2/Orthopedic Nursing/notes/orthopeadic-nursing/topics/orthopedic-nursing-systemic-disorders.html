                        <p>It is a term used to refer to any condition that causes reduction in the mass of bone per unit volume. Most often is used to describe its primary type which is an age related metabolic bone disease in which there is severe reduction in the skeletal bone mass and increased susceptibility to fractures. In this case bone resorption occurs faster than bone formation i.e. osteoclastic activity is higher than the osteoblastic activity. It occurs mainly on the bones of the wrist, hip and vertebral column. It has two main types;-</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Primary type</h4>
                        <p>This is postmenopausal osteoporosis and is the most common. It has association with underlying medical condition.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Secondary type</h4>
                        <p>Occurs with underlying medical condition e.g. hyperparathyroidism or an iatrogenic cause e.g. long term corticosteroid or heparin administration.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Risks factors of osteoporosis.</h4>
                        <p>They are divided into two</p>
                        <p><strong>I. Individual risk factors.</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increased age</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>II. Life style risk factors.</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cigarette smoking/ heavy caffeine intake/ alcohol abuse</li>
                            <li>Lack of weight bearing exercise.</li>
                            <li>Lack of exposure to sunshine.</li>
                            <li>Diet low in calcium and vitamin D</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h4>
                        <p>Normally through out a lifespan new bone is formed (osteoblastic activity) while old bone is resorbed (osteoclastic). The peak bone mass is at the age of 30-35 years of age. After this there is a decrease in calcium deposition and osteoblastic activity with age. This coupled with a decrease in estrogen production of menopause the end result is a decrease in bone mass and density. These bones become weak and prone to fractures</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">PAGET'S DISEASE (OSTEITIS DEFORMANS)</h3>
                        <p>It is a disorder of localized rapid bone turnover, mostly affecting the skull, femur, tibia, pelvic bone and vertebrae</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Etiology</h4>
                        <p><strong>Viral</strong></p>
                        <p>Paget's disease may be caused by a slow virus infection (i.e., paramyxoviridae) present for many years before symptoms appear. Associated viral infections include respiratory syncytial virus, canine distemper virus, and the measles virus. However, recent evidence has cast some doubt upon the measles association. Laboratory contamination may have played role in past studies linking paramyxovirus (e.g. measles) to Paget's disease.</p>
                        <p><strong>Genetic</strong></p>
                        <p>There is a hereditary factor in the development of Paget's disease of bone. Two genes, SQSTM1 and RANK, and specific regions of chromosome 5 and 6 are associated with Paget's disease of bone. Genetic causes may or may not involve a family history of Paget's disease.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pathophisiology</h4>
                        <p>Paget's disease is described in 4 stages:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Osteoclastic activity</li>
                            <li>Mixed osteoclastic - osteoblastic activity</li>
                            <li>Osteoblastic activity</li>
                            <li>Malignant degeneration</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Initially, there is a marked increase in the rate of bone resorption in localized areas, caused by large and numerous osteoclasts. These localized areas of pathological destruction of bone tissue (osteolysis) are seen radiologically as an advancing lytic wedge in long bones or the skull. When this occurs in the skull, it is called osteoporosis circumscripta. The osteolysis is followed by a compensatory increase in bone formation induced by the bone forming cells, called osteoblasts, that are recruited to the area. This is associated with accelerated deposition of lamellar bone in a disorganized fashion. This intense cellular activity produces a chaotic picture of trabecular bone ("mosaic" pattern), rather than the normal linear lamellar pattern. The resorbed bone is replaced and the marrow spaces are filled by an excess of fibrous connective tissue with a marked increase in blood vessels, causing the bone to become hypervascular. The bone hypercellularity may then diminish, leaving a dense "pagetic bone," also known as burned-out Paget's disease.</p>
                        <p>Sir James Paget first suggested the disease was due to an inflammatory process. Some evidence suggests that a paramyxovirus infection is the underlying cause of Paget's disease, which may support the possible role of inflammation in the pathogenesis. However, no infectious virus has yet been isolated as a causative agent, and Further research is therefore necessary.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical manifestations</h4>
                        <p>Usually asymptomatic and diagnosis is made when radiographic investigations are carried out after traumatic experience. For the symptomatic cases the presenting features include</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pain in the lower limbs</li>
                            <li>Frequent fractures</li>
                            <li>Waddling gait</li>
                            <li>Skull becomes enlarged so that the face looks small and triangular in shape</li>
                            <li>Barrel shaped chest</li>
                            <li>Kyphosis</li>
                            <li>Symptoms related to nerve compression.</li>
                            <li>Hypercalcaemia, hypercalciuria</li>
                            <li>increased temperature in the affected bone because of high bone vascularity</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">DIAGNOSIS</h4>
                        <p>Paget's disease may be diagnosed using one or more of the following tests:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pagetic bone has a characteristic appearance on X-rays. A skeletal survey is therefore indicated.</li>
                            <li>An elevated level of alkaline phosphatase in the blood in combination with normal calcium, phosphate, and aminotransferase levels in an elderly patient are suggestive of Paget's disease.</li>
                            <li>Markers of bone turnover in urine eg. Pyridinoline</li>
                            <li>Elevated levels of serum and urinary hydroxyproline are also found.</li>
                            <li>Bone scans are useful in determining the extent and activity of the condition. If a bone scan suggests Paget's disease, the affected bone(s) should be X-rayed to confirm the diagnosis.</li>

                        <p>Is the softening of the bones caused by defective bone mineralization secondary to inadequate levels of available phosphate and calcium, or because of overactive resorption of calcium from the bone which can be caused by hyperparathyroidism (which causes hypercalcemia). Osteomalacia in children is known as rickets, and because of this, use of the term "osteomalacia" is often restricted to the milder, adult form of the disease. Signs and symptoms can include diffuse body pains, muscle weakness, and fragility of the bones.</p>
                        <p>This is a condition whereby bones become abnormally soft because of a disturbed calcium and phosphorus balance due to vitamin D deficiency. It results in marked deformity of the weight bearing bones and pathologic fractures. It is the adult form of rickets its characterized by inadequate bone mineralization</p>

                        <p>This is a term use to describe any infection of the bones that results in inflammation, necrosis and formation of a new bone.</p>
                        <p>It is divided into the following classes</p>
                        <p><strong>Acute:</strong> - responds to antibiotic treatment for 4-6 weeks</p>
                        <p><strong>Chronic:</strong> - persists longer than 4 weeks and involves sequestered (necrotic bone that has separated from the living) areas of infection.</p>

                            <li>Diabetes (most cases of osteomyelitis stem from diabetes)</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY.</h4>
                        <p>It is of bacterial origin mainly, mostly staph aureus which causes 70-80% of bone infection. Other pathogenic organisms frequently found in osteomyelitis include proteus and pseudomonas species and E. coli.</p>
                        <p>The initial response to infection is inflammation, increase vascularity and edema. After 2-3days thrombosis of the blood vessels occurs in the area resulting in ischemia with bone necrosis. The infection extends into the medullary cavity and under the periosteum and may spread into adjacent soft tissue and joints. Unless the infective process is treated promptly a bone abscess forms. The resulting abscess cavity contains dead bone tissue which does not easily liquefy and drain(microorganisms may infect bone through one or more of three basic methods: via the bloodstream, contiguously from local areas of infection (as in cellulitis), or penetrating trauma, including iatrogenic causes such as joint replacements or internal fixation of fractures or root-canaled teeth. Once the bone is infected, leukocytes enter the infected area, and, in their attempt to engulf the infectious organisms, release enzymes that lyse the bone. Pus spreads into the bone's blood vessels, impairing their flow, and areas of devitalized infected bone, known as sequestra, form the basis of a chronic infection. Often, the body will try to create new bone around the area of necrosis. The resulting new bone is often called an involucrum)</p>

                        <p>Inflammation of the joint is known as arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, systemic, progressive, inflammatory connective tissue disorder affecting mainly the small, peripheral joints in a pattern of symmetric distribution.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Etiology</h4>
                        <p>It is unknown but it is genetically predisposed and it is thought to be an autoimmune disease.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pathophysiology.</h4>
                        <p>In RA the autoimmune reaction primarily occurs in the synovial tissues, phagocytosis produces enzymes within the joint. The enzyme breaks down collagen, causing edema, proliferation of the synovial membrane and ultimately Pannus formation. Pannus destroys cartilage and erodes the bone. The consequence is loss of articular surfaces and joint motion. Muscle fiber undergoes degenerative changes tendons and ligament elasticity and contractile power are lost.</p>

                        <p>Primary gout is a familial metabolic disorder of purine metabolism which results in abnormal amounts of urate in the body. Normally referred to as the disease of the rich. Purines are products of protein synthesis whose excess may lead to inadequate metabolism. The result is accumulation of the products of incomplete metabolism, uric acid. When this uric acid accumulates in blood it is precipitated to form crystals and deposited in various places in the body to include:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The kidney as stones</li>
                            <li>Joints</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The deposited crystals behave like foreign bodies and stimulate an inflammatory response at the area of deposition. In the case of joints gouty arthritis ensues. Thus the main clinical problem is recurrent attacks of arthritis in which case a client is totally incapacitated. Mostly it affects_great toe, knee, the small joints of the feet and hands, the wrist and elbow. It occurs more in male than female</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA</h3>
                        <p>Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI and sometimes known as brittle bone disease, or "Lobstein syndrome is a congenital bone disorder. People with OI are born with defective connective tissue, or without the ability to make it, usually because of a deficiency of Type-I collagen. This deficiency arises from an amino acid substitution of glycine to bulkier amino acids in the collagen triple helix structure. As a genetic disorder, OI has historically been viewed as an autosomal dominant disorder of type I collagen. Most cases have been caused by mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">TYPES</h4>
                        <p><strong>Type I</strong></p>
                        <p>Blue sclera in osteogenesis imperfecta.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Collagen is of normal quality but is produced in insufficient quantities:</li>
                            <li>Bones fracture easily</li>
                            <li>Slight spinal curvature</li>
                            <li>Loose joints</li>
                            <li>Poor muscle tone</li>
                            <li>Discoloration of the sclera (whites of the eyes), usually giving them a blue-gray color. The blue-gray color of the sclera is due to the underlying choroidal veins which show through. This is due to the sclera being thinner than normal because of the defective Type I collagen not forming correctly.</li>
                            <li>Early loss of hearing in some children</li>
                            <li>Slight protrusion of the eyes</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Type II</strong></p>
                        <p>Collagen is not of a sufficient quality or quantity</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Most cases die within the first year of life due to respiratory failure or intracerebral hemorrhage</li>
                            <li>Severe respiratory problems due to underdeveloped lungs</li>
                            <li>Severe bone deformity and small stature</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Type II can be further subclassified into groups A, B, C, which are distinguished by radiographic evaluation of the long bones and ribs. Type IIA demonstrates broad and short long bones with broad and beaded ribs. Type IIB demonstrates broad and short long bones with thin ribs that have little or no beading. Type IIC demonstrates thin and longer long bones with thin and beaded ribs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Type III</strong></p>
                        <p>Collagen improperly formed. Enough collagen is made but it is defective</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bones fracture easily, sometimes even before birth</li>
                            <li>Bone deformity, often severe</li>
                            <li>Respiratory problems possible</li>
                            <li>Short stature, spinal curvature and sometimes barrel-shaped rib cage</li>
                            <li>Triangular face</li>
                            <li>Loose joints(double jointed)</li>
                            <li>Poor muscle tone in arms and legs</li>
                            <li>Discolouration of the sclera (the 'whites' of the eyes are blue)</li>
                            <li>Early loss of hearing possible</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Type III is distinguished among the other classifications as being the "Progressive Deforming" type, wherein a neonate presents with mild symptoms at birth and develops the aforementioned symptoms throughout life. Lifespan may be normal, albeit with severe physical handicapping.</p>
                        <p><strong>Type IV</strong></p>
                        <p>Collagen quantity is sufficient but is not of a high enough quality</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bones fracture easily, especially before puberty</li>
                            <li>Short stature, spinal curvature and barrel-shaped rib cage</li>
                            <li>Bone deformity is mild to moderate</li>
                            <li>Early loss of hearing</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Similar to Type I, Type IV can be further subclassified into types IVA and IVB characterized by absence (IVA) or presence (IVB) of dentinogenesis imperfecta.</p>
                        <p><strong>Type V</strong></p>
                        <p>Same clinical features as Type IV. Distinguished histologically by "mesh-like" bone appearance. Further characterized by the "V Triad" consisting of a) radio-opaque band adjacent to growth plates, b) hypertrophic calluses at fracture sites, and c) calcification of the radio-ulnar interosseous membrane</p>
                        <p>OI Type V leads to calcification of the membrane between the two forearm bones, making it difficult to turn the wrist. Another symptom is abnormally large amounts of repair tissue (hyperplasic callus) at the site of fractures. Other features of this condition include radial head dislocation, long bone bowing and mixed hearing loss.</p>
                        <p>At leastb some cases of this type are caused by mutations in the interferon induced transmembrane protein 5 (IFITM5) gene.</p>
                        <p><strong>Type VI</strong></p>
                        <p>Same clinical features as Type IV. Distinguished histologically by "fish-scale" bone appearance. Type VI has recently been found to be caused by a loss of function mutation in the Serpin F1 gene. Serpin F1, a member of the serpin family is also known as pigment epithelium derived factor PEDF, the most powerful endogenous antiangiogenic factor in mammals.</p>
                        <p><strong>Type VII</strong></p>
                        <p>In 2006 a recessive form called "Type VII" was discovered (Phenotype severe to lethal). Thus far it seems to be limited to a First Nations people in Quebec. Mutations in the gene CRTAP causes this type.</p>
                        <p>Although Type VII is indeed associated with First Nations people in Northern Quebec, the reference cited in this review is not supportive of that fact. It doesn't mention anything about First Nations, aboriginal, Native American, American Indian, or indigenous peoples.</p>
                        <p><strong>Type VIII</strong></p>
                        <p>OI caused by mutation in the gene LEPRE1 is classified as type VIII.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                        <p>At present there is no cure for OI. Treatment is aimed at increasing overall bone strength to prevent fracture and maintain mobility.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There have been many clinical trials performed with Fosamax (Alendronate), a drug used to treat those experiencing brittleness of bones due to osteoporosis. Higher levels of effectiveness apparently are to be seen in the pill form versus the IV form, but results seem inconclusive. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will not approve Fosamax as a treatment for OI because long term effects of the drug have not been fully researched yet, although it is often used in preteens, instead of Pamidronate.</li>
                            <li>Regular weight-bearing exercise, a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, a healthy lifestyle, and, in some cases, vitamin supplements will help off-set early development of osteoporosis, prevent future fractures, and delay other health concerns related to OI.</li>
                            <li>Bone infections are treated as and when they occur with the appropriate antibiotics and antiseptics.</li>
                            <li>Physiotherapy used to strengthen muscles and improve motility in a gentle manner, while minimizing the risk of fracture. This often involves hydrotherapy and the use of support cushions to improve posture. Individuals are encouraged to change positions regularly throughout the day in order to balance the muscles which are being used and the bones which are under pressure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Children often develop a fear of trying new ways of moving due to movement being associated with pain. This can make physiotherapy difficult to administer to young children.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Physical aids</strong> With adaptive equipment such as crutches, wheelchairs, splints, grabbing arms, and/or modifications to the home many individuals with OI can obtain a significant degree of autonomy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bisphosphonates(BPs)</strong>, particularly those containing nitrogen, are being increasingly administered to increase bone mass and reduce the incidence of fracture.</li>
                            <li><strong>Surgery.</strong> Metal rods can be surgically inserted in the long bones to improve strength, a procedure developed by Harold A. Sofield, MD, at Shriners Hospitals for Children in Chicago.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">BONE TUMORS</h3>
                        <p>Bone tumors occur commonly in children and adolescents but less common in older adults.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In older adults is most commonly the result of metastatic spread from another tumor.</li>
                            <li>Characterized by rapid metastasis & bone destruction</li>
                            <li>Common indication for amputation</li>
                            <li>There are many different types of bone cancer, The most common primary bone tumors include osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, chondrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosarcoma, and chordoma.</li>
                            <li>There are various types of benign bone tumors. These include osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma, osteochondroma, enchondroma, chondromyxoid fibroma, aneurysmal bone cyst, unicameral bone cyst, and giant cell tumor (which has the potential to become malignant). As with other types of benign tumors, these are not cancerous.</li>
                            <li>Two other relatively common types of cancer than develop in the bones: lymphoma and multiple myeloma</li>
                            <li><strong>Osteosarcoma:</strong>-_most common primary malignant bone cancer. Commonly affects males between 10-25 years old but can attack older adults even. It often occurs in the long bones of the arms and legs at areas of rapid growth around the knees and shoulders of children. This type of cancer is often very aggressive with risk of spread to the lungs. The five-year survival rate is about 65%.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ewing's sarcoma:</strong>- is the most aggressive bone tumor and affects younger people between 4-15 years of age. It is more common in males and is very rare in people over 30 years of age. It most commonly occurs in the middle of the long bones of the arms and legs. The three-year survival rate is about 65%, but this rate is much lower if there has been spread to the lungs or other tissues of the body.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chondrosarcoma:</strong>- is the second most common bone tumor and accounts for about 25% of all malignant bone tumors. These tumors arise from the cartilage cells and can either be very aggressive or relatively slow growing. Unlike many other bone tumors, chondrosarcoma is most common in people over 40 years of age. It is slightly more common in males and can potentially spread to the lungs and lymph nodes. Chondrosarcoma most commonly affects the bones of the pelvis and hips. The five-year survival for the aggressive form is about 30%, but the survival rate for slow-growing tumors is 90%.</li>
                            <li><strong>Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH):</strong>- affects the soft tissues, including muscle, ligaments, tendons, and fat. It is the most common soft-tissue malignancy in later adult life, usually occurring in people 50-60 years of age. It most commonly affects the extremities and is about twice as common in males as females. MFH also has a wide range of severity. The overall five-year survival rate is about 35%-60%.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fibrosarcoma:</strong>- is much more rare than the other bone tumors. It is most common in people 35-55 years of age. It most commonly affects the soft tissues of the leg behind the knee. Slightly more common in males</li>
                            <li><strong>Chordoma :</strong>- is a very rare tumor with an average survival of about six years after diagnosis. It occurs in adults over 30 years of age and is about twice as common in males as females. It most commonly affects either the lower or upper end of the spinal column.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lymphoma</strong>, a cancer arising from the cells of the immune system, usually begins in the lymph nodes but can begin in the bone.</li>
                            <li><strong>Multiple myeloma</strong> begins in the bones, but it is not usually considered a bone tumor because it is a tumor of the bone marrow cells and not of the bone cells.</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical features</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Pain:</strong>- In most cases, the symptoms become gradually more severe with time. Initially, the pain may only be present either at night or with activity. Depending on the growth of the tumor, those affected may have symptoms for weeks, months, or years before seeking medical advice.</li>
                            <li>In some cases, a mass or lump may be felt either on the bone or in the tissues surrounding the bone. This is most common with MFH or fibrosarcoma but can occur with other bone tumors.</li>
                            <li>The bones can become weakened by the tumor and lead to a fracture after little or no trauma or just from standing on the affected bone. This can occur with both benign and malignant tumors. Even benign tumors can spread locally and weaken the surrounding bone.</li>
                            <li>If the tumor compresses the surrounding nerve it can cause pain, numbness, or tingling in the extremities.</li>
                            <li>If the surrounding blood vessels are compressed, it can affect the blood flow to the extremities.</li>
                            <li>Fever, chills, night sweats, and weight loss can occur but are less common. These symptoms are more common after spread of the tumor to other tissues in the body.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Diagnosis</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Take a complete medical history:</strong>- gives clues on diagnosis. Some types of cancer have familial tendency while others are more common in people with certain lifestyles e.g. smoking.</li>
                            <li>A complete physical examination to include testing the muscle strength, sensation to touch, and reflexes to help find the cause of the symptoms</li>
                            <li>Certain blood tests can be ordered that can help to identify a possible cancer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Imaging studies:</strong>- to help determine the type of cancer or to identify if a fracture has occurred or if the bone has been weakened and is at risk for a potential fracture.</li>
                            <li><strong>C.T Scan:</strong>-gives cross-sectional images, is better able to identify a possible tumor and gives additional information on the size and location of the tumor.</li>
                            <li><strong>M.R.Is:</strong>- provides cross sectional imaging of the body. It provides better detail of the soft tissues, including muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, and blood vessels than a CT scan. This test can give better detail on whether or not the bone tumor has broken through the bone and involved the surrounding soft tissues or not.</li>
                            <li><strong>A bone scan:</strong>-_identifies areas of rapidly growing or remodeling bone & is often taken of the entire body. It may be ordered to identify any other areas of bone involvement throughout the body. It is not specific for any specific type of tumor and can be positive with many other conditions including infection, fracture, and arthritis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Biopsy of a sample of the tumor:</strong>- the biopsy can be obtained either through a needle biopsy or incision biopsy. Imaging studies will be used to determine the safest and easiest location of biopsy</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                        <ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Surgery</li>
                            <li>Chemotherapy</li>
                            <li>Radiation therapy</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>N.B These can be used either individually or combined with each other.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Surgery</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The goal of surgery is usually to remove the entire tumor and a surrounding area of normal bone.</li>
                            <li>Historically amputations were frequently used to remove bone cancer.</li>
                            <li>In many cases, the tumor can be removed with a rim of normal bone without the need for an amputation.</li>
                            <li>Depending on the amount of bone removed, the surgeon will replace something in its location. For smaller areas, this may be either bone cement or a bone graft from another place in your body or from the bone bank. For larger areas, the surgeon may place larger grafts from the bone bank or metal implants. Some of these metal implants have the ability to lengthen when used in growing children.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Chemotherapy</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is the use of various medications used to try to stop the growth of the cancer cells.</li>
                            <li>Chemotherapy can be used prior to surgery to try to shrink the bone tumor to make surgery easier.</li>
                            <li>It can also be used after surgery to try to kill any remaining cancer cells left following surgery.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Radiation</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Uses high-energy X-ray aimed at the site of the cancer to try to kill the cancer cells. This Rx is given in small doses daily over a period of days to months. As with chemotherapy, radiation therapy can be used either before or after a potential surgery, depending on the specific type of cancer.</li>
                            <li>Bone marrow transplant</li>
