                        <p>A fracture is a disruption of the normal bone continuity that occurs when more stress is placed on a bone that it is able to absorb. Surrounding soft tissue injury often occurs.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Classification</h3>
                        <p>They can be classified according to</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1. FRACTURE PATTERN</h4>
                        <p><strong>Closed (simple) fracture</strong></p>
                        <p>It is an uncomplicated fracture with intact skin over the fracture site, that is, bone does not protrude through the skin.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Open (compound) fracture</strong></p>
                        <p>A break in the skin is present over the fracture site. The wound communicates with the skin and fractured bone. This is prone to infection. These fractures may be divided further according to severity.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Grade I-skin puncture with minimal tissue damage</li>
                            <li>Grade II - as in grade I with skin and muscle contusion</li>
                            <li>Grade III- a wound larger than 6-8 cm with damage to blood vessels, nerves, muscles and skin</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>Complete fracture</strong></p>
                        <p>The fracture line extends through the bone substance, i.e. the periosteum is disrupted on both side of the bone. All compound fractures are usually complete</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Incomplete (partial fracture).</strong></p>
                        <p>Fracture line extends part way through the bone i.e. continuity is not completely disrupted. This is also known as a willow, green stick or hickory stick fracture.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Displaced fracture</strong></p>
                        <p>Bone fragments are separated at the fracture line</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Comminuted fracture</strong></p>
                        <p>More than 1 fracture line and bone fragments are crushed or broken into several pieces.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Impacted fracture (telescoped) or compression fracture</strong></p>
                        <p>One bone fragment is forcibly driven into another adjacent bone fragment.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Pathologic fracture</strong></p>
                        <p>It occurs as a result of underlying bone disorder such as osteoporosis or tumor. Usually occurs with minimal trauma</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Green stick fracture</strong></p>
                        <p>One side of the bone is broken and the other side is bent. A fracture in which a fragment of bone has been pulled away by a ligament or tendon and its attachment.</p>
                        <p>NB A fracture may combine many of the above patterns e.g. a closed complete pathological fracture.</p>

                        <p>In long bones fractures are described as being proximal, distal as midshaft, based on their location on the bone.</p>
                        <p>A. Colle's fracture: - common fracture in which the distal radius is fractured within 1 inch of articullar surface.</p>
                        <p>B. Pott's fracture: - occurs to the medial malleolus of the tibia and fibula and often is associated with rapture of the internal lateral ligmament or chipping off a piece of the medial malleolus or both.</p>
                        <p>This two were named after the physician who first described them.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">ETIOLOGY</h3>
                        <p>The most common is direct trauma to the bone which may be caused by a motor vehicle accident and falls. Other causes include;-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Primary bone disease such as osteoporosis or metastatic bone cancer can weaken the bony structure and lead to fracture.</li>
                            <li>Direct force - the fracture occurs at the point of contact with an object.</li>
                            <li>The humerus when some one tries to throw a stone or disk in sport</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</h3>
                        <p>When a bone is broken, the periosteum and blood vessels in the cortex, marrow and surrounding tissue are disrupted and begin to bleed. A hematoma forms between the fractured ends of the bone and beneath the periosteum. Bone tissue immediately adjacent to the fracture dies. This necrotic tissue stimulates an intense inflammatory response characterized by vasodilation of plasma and leukocytes as well as increased production of prostaglandins.</p>
                        <p>All these factors lead to the symptoms and signs of pain, swelling and dysfunction.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-bone-healing" class="section-heading">BONE HEALING</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Bone unlike some other specialized tissues is able to regenerate. Fracture healing occurs by the formation of new none tissue. New bone is formed by the activation of osteoclast and osteoblasts. Fractures usually heal over 6 weeks in the following stages</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Stage 1; Hematoma formation</h3>
                        <p>In 24 hours the blood clots begins to organize. As the blood in the hematoma coagulates a loose delicate mesh of fibrin forms around the fracture site. This fibrin mesh protectively encloses the damaged bone and acts as a scaffold for the in growth of the capillary buds and fibroblasts. These new capillaries grow into the hematoma.</p>
                        <p>The main blood supply increases to the bone ends unlike most hematomas, this one does not resolve on healing by undergoes changes into granulation tissue.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Stage II Cellular Proliferation</h3>
                        <p>The cells at the bone ends proliferate from the periosteum, endosteum and the bone marrow. The injury to the periosteum stimulates the deep layers so that proliferation of the osteoblast takes place. After several days, osteogenesis and granulation of tissue forms a collar around the end of each fragments. The collars advances and eventually unite and form a bridge across the fracture.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Stage III Callus formation</h3>
                        <p>After 6-10 days after injury, the granulation tissue changes to the pre-callus. Newly formed cartilage and bone matrix (derived from the undamaged periosteum and endosteum) disperse through the soft tissue callus to form a provisional callus. This is made up of a large, loosely woven mass of bone and cartilage and is wider than the normal bone diameter. It secures the bone fragments but does not provide strength. It extends beyond the fracture line to form a splint. For uncomplicated fractures the size of the callus reaches its maximal size by 14-21 days after injury.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Stage IV Ossification</h3>
                        <p>A permanent callus of true rigid bone eventually forms by the deposition of calcium salts which knits the fracture ends together. Ossification first forms an external callus then an internal callus and finally an intermediate callus. During the 3<sup>rd</sup>-10<sup>th</sup> weeks of healing, the callus converts into bone. This formation of born firmly binds together the fractured ends and completes healing.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Stage V Consolidation and remodeling</h3>
                        <p>At the time bone is being formed the callus is remodeled by osteoclastic activity. In effect excess bone is chiseled away and absorbed from the callus. This remodeling is affected by the stress on it by muscles and weight bearing. This follows the Wolff's law, which basically states that a bone's structure is determined by its function, that is, the stresses and strains placed on it.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">HEALING TIME</h3>
                        <p>This varies with the</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Type of fracture- impacted and displaced fractures take longer.</li>
                            <li>Type of bone- spongy bone takes shorter time than compact bone e.g. arms 3 months while legs take 6 months.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Factors that enhance fracture healing.</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Immobilization of fracture fragments.</li>

                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Arterial damage</strong> -contusion, thrombosis, severance, lacerations by the fracture or the cast. Arteries may be constricted by bandages or casts that are too tight.</p>
                                <p>Diagnosis is -absent pulse, swelling, pallor, patch cyanosis distal to fracture, blood loss, large fracture hematomas, cold extremity, poor capillary refill and anesthesia.</p>

                                <p><strong>Compartment syndrome</strong></p>
                                <p>A compartment syndrome is a closed place which is made up of bones, muscles, nerves and blood vessels wrapped by a fibrous membrane. Bleeding or edema may occur within it thus exerting pressure on the pliable muscles, nerves and vessels. It can also occur due to external pressure from a tight dressing or cast. It is characterized by ischemic pain not relieved by narcotic analgesic and occurs on raising /elevation due to a decrease in arterial flow and also when touched. There also will be inactivity, absent pulses, coolness, parasthesias (needles and pins sensations) and pallor.</p>
                                <p>Management is by removing the cause e.g. cast or dressing and incase of edema or bleeding fasciotomy is done and the place left open until the edema or bleeding stops. If not managed on time it may lead to loss of the limb because of the need of amputation.</p>

                                <p><strong>Fat embolism</strong></p>
                                <p>A potentially life threatening condition occurs with fractures of long bones and the pelvis. It occurs 24-48 hours after injury and two theories explain is etiology.</p>
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Mechanical theory- trauma causes disruption of the fragile veins and the fat cells in the bone marrow. Fat globules enter the circulation aided by increased pressure from the hematoma at the fracture site.</li>
                                    <li>Biochemical - catecholamines released due to the stress of injury mobilizes lipids from the adipose tissue and makes them coalesce into large droplets which embolise the lung.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></p>
                                <p>Once the fat globules reach the lung they are unable to pass through its circulation. They lodge in the vessels and breakdown into FA. Free fatty acids are toxic to the lung parenchyma, capillary endothelium and the surfactant. The result is pulmonary hypertension.</p>

                                <p><strong>Volkmann's Ischemic contracture</strong></p>
                                <p>This occurs in the arm and form as a result of fracture affecting the elbow or forearm bones. It begins as a compartment syndrome that compromises the arterial and venous circulation. This results in prolonged ischemia with degeneration of the muscle tissue and replacement with fibrous tissue. This fibrous tissue traps tendons and nerves. The typical result is a permanent, stiff, claw like deformity of the arm and the hand.</p>
                                <p>The Volkmann's contracture is most common with a supracondylar fracture of the humerus but can occur with crushing injuries or tight bandages. To avoid such deformity, compartment syndrome should be diagnosed and treated early.</p>

                                <p><strong>Delayed union</strong></p>
                                <p>This is failure of a fracture to consolidate within the required time frame. This occurs due to retardation of the healing process. It can be managed by additional time and the removal of the cause.</p>

                                <p><strong>Nonunion</strong></p>
                                <p>It is the failure of a fracture site to consolidate and produce a complete, firm and stable union after 6-9months. It is characterized by excessive motion in the fracture site that leads to a false joint (pseudoarthrosis). Causes are similar to those of delayed. Management is by use of bone grafts.</p>

                                <p>This is the healing of a fracture site with an increased degree of angulation or deformity. If seen early in fracture healing it can be corrected with re-immobilization. Malunion after healing is usually corrected with surgery.</p>
