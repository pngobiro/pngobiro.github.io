                        <p>The primary goals are;-</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To return limb to maximal function</li>
                            <li>Prevent complications</li>
                            <li>Obtain the best possible cosmetic result.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>-Vital signs should be monitored closely because of the risk of shock due to hemorrhage, pain or embolism.</p>
                        <p>-Patient should be kept NPO depending on the type of fracture because there might be need for surgery.</p>
                        <p>-Ensure rest and rest may be also promoted by not using the affected parts like for fractures of the distal phalanges most often it is the only form of management for such fractures.</p>
                        <p>-There are <strong>3</strong> main forms of definitive management for fractures. These are;-</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">I) Reduction</h3>
                        <p>This is the restoration of the injured bone to the normal anatomic alignment, position and length. It also brings the fractured fragments together to promote healing. This is usually painful and requires anesthesia especially in complete displaced fractures or impacted ones.</p>
                        <p>Undisplaced fractures do not require reduction and may only require splinting to avoid displacement.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Types of reduction include</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Closed reduction/manipulation</strong>-In this case a physician brings the bone fragments into alignment without making a surgical incision. This may be done in 3 ways
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Traction and counter traction</li>
                                    <li>Angulation</li>
                                    <li>Rotation</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>This requires a lot of skill and x-ray films are taken to confirm alignment then a cast is usually applied to splint it.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Open reduction</strong>-An incision is made and fracture is aligned during surgery under direct vision. The time of surgery, various fixation devices may be applied to the fracture bone to maintain alignment (e.g. screws, plates, pins, wires, nails), or rods may be placed through bone fragments, fixed to the sides of the bone or inserted directly into the bone's medullary cavity.
                                <p>It is the treatment of choice in compound fractures that are comminuted and accompanied by serious neurovascular injuries, widely separated fragments or soft tissue interposition. It is also recommended for fracture of femur and of joints. Internal fixation helps immobilize a fracture and prevent deformity and is not a substitute for healing. So with time without bone healing they succumb to stress, loosen or break.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">II) Traction</h3>
                        <p>Therapeutic traction (pull) is accomplished by exerting a pull on the head, body or limbs in two directions i.e. pull of traction and of counter traction.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Traction is produced by weights</li>
                            <li>Counter traction by person's weight or other weights (pulleys, weight and ropes.)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The traction should</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Support and stretch the extremity in a direction that properly aligns bone fragments</li>
                            <li>Overstretch the limb</li>
                            <li>Maintain stretching forces that are constant until union of bones.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Traction is applied in the directions in line with the long axis of the bone while for the head and pelvis traction is in the direction of the spinal column.</p>
                        <p>With traction of the long limbs the bed is elevated so as to reduce the amount of counter traction required. Thus only the person's body is needed.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Methods of applying traction</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Manually pulling on the body parts with the hands</li>
                            <li>Mechanically by exerting a pull on the body part with ropes and pulleys</li>
                            <li>With devices inserted in the cast (plaster traction)</li>
                            <li>With braces (e.g. hyperextension braces)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Advantages</h4>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Greater potential for exercising the joints and muscles than it is possible with casts</li>
                            <li>Elimination of surgery and its complications.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ol type="I">
                            <li>Prolonged hospitalization</li>
                            <li>Bed rest necessary</li>
                            <li>Risk of complications like venous thrombosis, osteoporosis and bedsores due to immobility</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Purpose of traction.</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reduce fracture or dislocation and maintain alignment</li>
                            <li>Decrease muscles spasms and relieve pain</li>
                            <li>Correct, lessen or prevent deformities</li>
                            <li>Promote rest of a diseased or injured part.</li>
                            <li>Promote exercise.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Indications for traction.</h4>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Bone fractures.</li>
                           <li>Bone dislocation.</li>
                           <li>Muscle spasms.</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE TRACTION.</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Traction must be continuous to be effective in reducing and immobilizing fractures.</li>
                            <li>Skeletal traction is never interrupted.</li>
                            <li>Weight is not removed unless intermittent traction is prescribed.</li>
                            <li>Any factor that might reduce the effective pull or alter its resultant line of pull must be eliminated.</li>
                            <li>For traction to be effective there must be counter traction i.e. force acting in the opposite direction.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>There are two main forms of traction</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Skin traction</strong>- strapping (legs), anklets, corsets (pelvic fracture) and halters (on the head for cervical problems) are used to apply traction on particular parts of the body. It is used to immobilize an area before surgery and control muscle spasms. the amount of weight applied must not exceed the tolerance of the skin no more than 23.5 KG of traction can be used on an extremity. Pelvic traction is usually 4.5-9 KGS depending on the weight of the patient</li>
                            <li><strong>Skeletal traction</strong>- metal wires or pins are surgically inserted into bones or metals tongs anchored in the skull. The weights are attached to the pin or wire by a rope and pulley system that exerts the appropiriate amount and direction of pull for effective traction. It frequently uses 7-12 KGS.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Example of types of traction</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Buck's traction</strong>-It is a form of skin traction exerted by the pull on one or both legs. It is used to immobilize a limb for a short time while waiting for another form of management like hip replacement or to reduce muscle spasm.<p>Other uses include TB of the hip, arthritis and pelvic injuries. It is contraindicated in diabetic gangrene, stasis dermatitis and serious varicosities.</p>
                            <p>A fabricated boot (cast) not restricting movement of the ankle is put 1 to 2 inches below the knee. The traction is usually continuous. Incase there is need to charge the weights, manual traction should be applied while the change is being made.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Cervical traction</strong> - It holds the head in extension to treat muscles sprains, strains and spasm and is usually applied with a head halter. Skeletal cervical traction using skull tongs or a halo apparatus may be used in stabilizing fracture or dislocations of the cervical or upper thoracic spine. A halo consists of a head piece with four pins, two anterior and two posterior. The head piece attaches to a body jacket. The purpose is immobilization and currently they are rarely used.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pelvic traction</strong> accomplished with a belt applied just above and encircling the iliac crests. The belt attaches to the spreader bar and pulley system. Traction is applied to the lumber spine.</li>
                            <li><strong>Russell's traction</strong>-this is a modification of the buck's traction. It adds a vertical pull by placing a sling under the leg above the knee. It is used to immobilize hip fracture or the shaft of the femur.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Potential complications.</h4>
                        <p>Skin break down: - which results from irritation caused by contact of the skin with the tape foam and shearing forces.</p>
                        <p>Nerve pressure: - results from pressure on the peripheral nerves. Circulatory impairment: - which is usually manifested by cold skin temperature, decreased peripheral pulses, slow capillary refill time and bluish skin.</p>
                        <p>Others are:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Anorexia.</li>
                            <li>Constipation.</li>
                            <li>Urinary stasis and infection.</li>
                            <li>Venous stasis with DVT.</li>
                            <li>Pneumonia.</li>
                            <li>Pressure ulcers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">III) Casting</h3>
                        <p>They are temporary devices made from plaster of Paris or fiber glass that are used to immobilize a body part, usually an extremity. Its purpose is</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Immobilize a reduced fracture.</li>
                            <li>Prevent or correct deformities e.g. talipes equinoverus.</li>
                            <li>Maintenance of support and protection to realign bone.</li>
                            <li>Promotion of healing which allows early weight bearing for ambulation.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Types of casts</h4>
                        <p><strong>Short arm</strong>- extends from thumb and palm to mid arm. Used to treat fracture distal radius, humerus as a hanging cast, wrist sprains and carpal fractures.</p>
                        <p><strong>Short leg</strong>- used to treat fracture of the tibia, fibula and ankle. It extends from foot to hip and holds knee in flexion if fracture is unstable to prevent weight bearing. If eight permitted a cylinder cast is used</p>
                        <p><strong>Cast brace</strong>- it is used to treat a stable distal femur fracture. Has two parts above and below knee with a hinge to allow knee joint movement.</p>
                        <p><strong>Body cast:</strong>- encircles the trunk</p>
                        <p><strong>Hip spica</strong>- used to treat fracture of the hip and to immobilize the hip. Cast extends from mid trunk to foot or feet, hips abducted with a bar. An opening is made for elimination.</p>
                        <p><strong>Walking cast:</strong>- ashort or long leg cast reinforced for strength</p>
                        <p><strong>Shoulder spica cast:</strong>- abody jacket that encloses the trunk,shoulder and elbow</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">ASSESSMENT BEFORE APPLYING THE CAST.</h4>
                        <p>The nurse completes an assessment of the patient general health, presenting signs and symptoms, emotional status, understanding the need for the cast and condition of the body part to be immobilized in the cast. The physical assessment of the part to be immobilizes must include assessment of the neurovascular status (neurologic and circulatory functioning) of the body part, degree and location of swelling, bruising and skin abrasion.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">NURSING INTERVENTIONS.</h4>
                        <p><strong>Explaining the treatment regimen.</strong></p>
                        <p>Before applying the cast the patient needs information concerning the pathological problem and the purpose and expectations of the prescribed treatment regimen. Preparation of the patient for application of the cast by describing the anticipated sights sounds and sensations e.g. heat from the hardening reaction of plaster.</p>
                        <p><strong>Relieving pain.</strong></p>
                        <p>The patient should elevate the affected part, apply cold as prescribed and administer usual dosages of analgesics.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">Pain associated with the disease process is controlled by immobilization.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">Pain due to edema that is associated with trauma, surgery or bleeding into the tissue can be controlled by elevation and intermittent application of cold.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Improving mobility.</strong></p>
                        <p>Every joint that is not immobilized should be exercised and moved through its range of motion to maintain function.

                        <ol>
                            <li><p><strong>Compartment syndrome.</strong></p>
                                <p>It occurs when there is increased tissue pressure within a limited space that compromises the circulation and the function of tissue within the confined area.</p>
                                <p>To relieve the pressure the cast must be cut into half longitudinally while maintaining alignment and the extremity must be elevated no higher than heart level.</p>
                                <p>The nurse records neurovascular responses and promptly reports changes to the physician.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p><strong>Pressure ulcers.</strong></p>
                                <p>It may cause tissue anoxia and pressure ulcers. Lower extremity sites most susceptible to pressure are the heel, head of the fibula, dorsum of the foot and anterior surface of the patella.</p>
                                <p>The patient usually reports of pain and tightness in the area.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p><strong>Disuse syndrome.</strong></p>
                                <p>It occurs due to inability to use the affected area. The nurse assists the patient to learn to tense or contract muscles without moving the affected part, this helps to reduce muscle atrophy and maintain muscle strength.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p>When the cast is dry the patient is instructed as follows:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Move about as normally as possible, but avoid excessive use of the injured extremity and avoid walking on wet, slippery floor.</li>
                            <li>Perform prescribed exercise regularly.</li>
                            <li>Elevate the casted extremity to heart level frequently to prevent swelling.</li>
                            <li>Don't attempt to scratch the skin under the cast because it may cause break in the skin and hence result in the formation of skin ulcer.</li>
                            <li>Keep the cast dry but do not cover it with plastic or rubber because this causes condensation which dampens the cast and skin.</li>
                            <li>Report any of the following to the nurse: persistent pain, swelling that does not respond to elevation, change in sensation , decreased ability to move exposed fingers or toes and changes in skin color and temperature.</li>
                            <li>Note odors around the cast, stained areas, warm spots and pressure areas.</li>
                            <li>Report a broken cast to the physician; do not attempt to fix it yourself.</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Other management for fracture patients include;-</h4>
                        <p>Nutrition-increased dietary fiber helps with maintaining normal bowel movements in clients who are immobile. A well balanced diet promotes healing.</p>
                        <p>Exercises- the nurse should encourage the client to exercise to stimulate venous return, enhance healing and rehabilitation.</p>
                        <p>Health education should be given on the various methods of definitive management employed, nutrition, exercise, post hospital care e.g. care of the plaster</p>
                        <p>- Other needs arising with fractures will be managed symptomatically e.g.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>analgesics will be offered for pain,</li>
                            <li>Antibiotics for open fractures to prevent or treat infection including the post surgical cases.</li>
                            <li>Wound dressing where necessary</li>
                            <li>Skin care incase of long admission to include massage especially to patients on traction</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Assessment</h3>
                        <p>Before the cast is applied, the nurse completes an assessment of the patient's general health, presenting signs and symptoms, emotional status, understanding of the need for the cast, The condition of the body part to be immobilized in the cast. Physical assessment of the part to be immobilized must include assessment of the neurovascular status (neurologic and circulatory functioning) of the body part, degree and location of swelling, bruising, and skin abrasions.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">EXPLAINING THE TREATMENT REGIMEN</h3>
                        <p>Before the cast is applied, the patient needs information concerning the pathologic problem and the purpose and expectations of the prescribed treatment regimen. This knowledge promotes the patient's active participation in and adherence to the treatment program.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">RELIEVING PAIN</h3>
                        <p>The nurse must carefully evaluate pain associated with musculoskeletal problems, asking the patient to indicate the exact site and to describe the character and intensity of the pain to help determine its cause. Most pain can be relieved by elevating the involved part, applying cold as prescribed, and administering usual dosages of analgesics.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">IMPROVING MOBILITY</h3>
                        <p>Every joint that is not immobilized should be exercised and moved through its range of motion to maintain function.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">PROMOTING HEALING OF SKIN ABRASIONS</h3>
                        <p>Before the cast is applied, it is important to treat skin lacerations and abrasions to promote healing. The nurse thoroughly cleans the skin and treats it as prescribed. Sterile dressings are used to cover the injured skin. If the skin wounds are extensive, an alternative method (eg, external fixator) may be chosen to immobilize the body part.</p>
                        <p>While the cast is on, the nurse observes the patient for systemic signs of infection, odors from the cast, and purulent drainage staining the cast</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">MAINTAINING ADEQUATE NEUROVASCULAR FUNCTION</h3>
                        <p>The nurse monitors circulation, motion, and sensation of the affectedextremity, assessing the fingers or toes of the casted extremity andcomparing them with those of the opposite extremity. Normal findings include minimal swelling, minimal discomfort, pink color, warm to touch, rapid capillary refill response, normal sensations, and ability to exercise fingers or toes. The nurse encourages the patient to move fingers or toes hourly when awake to stimulate circulation.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Compartment Syndrome</h4>
                        <p>To relieve the pressure, the cast must be bivalved (cut in half longitudinally) while maintaining alignment, and the extremity must be elevated no higher than heart level If pressure is not relieved and circulation is not restored, a fasciotomy may be necessary to relieve the pressure within the muscle compartment</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pressure Ulcers</h4>
                        <p>Pressure of the cast on soft tissues may cause tissue anoxia and pressure ulcers Usually, the patient with a pressure ulcer reports pain and tightness in the area. A warm area on the cast suggests underlying tissue erythema. The area may break down. The drainage may stain the cast and emit an odor. monitor the patient with a cast for pressure ulcer development and report findings to the physician.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Disuse Syndrome</h4>
                        <p>While in a cast, the patient needs to learn to tense or contract muscles (eg, isometric muscle contraction) without moving the part Isometric exercises should be performed hourly while the patient is awake</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">HEALTH EDUCATION.</h3>
                        <p>When the cast is dry, the nurse instructs the patient as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Move about as normally as possible, but avoid excessive use of the injured extremity and avoid walking on wet, slippery floors or sidewalks.</li>
                            <li>Perform prescribed exercises regularly, as scheduled.</li>
                            <li>Elevate the casted extremity to heart level frequently to prevent swelling.</li>
                            <li>Do not attempt to scratch the skin under the cast. This may cause a break in the skin and result in the formation of a skin ulcer. Cool air from a hair dryer may alleviate an itch.</li>
                            <li>Cushion rough edges of the cast with tape.</li>
                            <li>Keep the cast dry but do not cover it with plastic or rubber,because this causes condensation, which dampens the cast and skin. Moisture softens a plaster cast. (A wet fiberglass cast must be dried thoroughly with a hair dryer on a cool setting to avoid skin problems.)</li>
                            <li>Report any of the following to the physician: persistent pain, swelling that does not respond to elevation, changes in sensation, decreased ability to move exposed fingers or toes, and changes in skin color and temperature.</li>
                            <li>Note odors around the cast, stained areas, warm spots, and pressure areas. Report them to the physician.</li>
                            <li>Report a broken cast to the physician; do not attempt to fix it .</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The nurse prepares the patient for cast removal or cast changes by explaining what to expect</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">BODY OR SPICA CASTS</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The nurse positions the pillows next to each other, because spaces between pillows allow the damp cast to sag,become weak, and possibly break.</li>
                            <li>A pillow is not placed under the head and shoulders of a patient in a body cast while the cast is drying, because doing so causes pressure on the chest.</li>
                            <li>The nurse turns the patient as a unit toward the uninjured side every 2 hours to relieve pressure and to allow the cast to dry</li>
                            <li>A stabilizing abduction bar incorporated into a spica cast should not be used as a turning device.</li>
                            <li>The nurse adjusts the pillows to provide support without creating areas of pressure.</li>
                            <li>The skin can be bathed and massaged by reaching under the cast edges with the fingers.</li>
                            <li>The perineal opening must be large enough for hygienic care.</li>
                            <li>Cast syndrome: psychological the nurse needs to recognize the anxiety reaction and provide an environment in which the patient feels secure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The physiologic cast syndrome responses (superior mesenteric artery syndrome) are associated with immobility in a body cast. With decreased physical activity, gastrointestinal motility decreases, intestinal gases accumulate, intestinal pressure increases, and ileus may occur. The patient exhibits abdominal distention, abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting If the cast restricts the abdomen, the abdominal window must be enlarged monitor bowel sounds.</p>
