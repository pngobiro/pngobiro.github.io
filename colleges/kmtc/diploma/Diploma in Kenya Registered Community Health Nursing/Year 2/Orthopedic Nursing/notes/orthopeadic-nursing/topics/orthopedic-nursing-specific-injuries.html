                        <p>A fracture is a disruption of the normal bone continuity that occurs when more stress is placed on a bone that it is able to absorb. Surrounding soft tissue injury often occurs.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Classification</h3>
                        <p>They can be classified according to</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1. FRACTURE PATTERN</h4>
                        <p><strong>Closed (simple) fracture</strong></p>
                        <p>It is an uncomplicated fracture with intact skin over the fracture site, that is, bone does not protrude through the skin.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Open (compound) fracture</strong></p>
                        <p>A break in the skin is present over the fracture site. The wound communicates with the skin and fractured bone. This is prone to infection. These fractures may be divided further according to severity.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Grade I-skin puncture with minimal tissue damage</li>
                            <li>Grade II - as in grade I with skin and muscle contusion</li>
                            <li>Grade III- a wound larger than 6-8 cm with damage to blood vessels, nerves, muscles and skin</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>Complete fracture</strong></p>
                        <p>The fracture line extends through the bone substance, i.e. the periosteum is disrupted on both side of the bone. All compound fractures are usually complete</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Incomplete (partial fracture).</strong></p>
                        <p>Fracture line extends part way through the bone i.e. continuity is not completely disrupted. This is also known as a willow, green stick or hickory stick fracture.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Displaced fracture</strong></p>
                        <p>Bone fragments are separated at the fracture line</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Comminuted fracture</strong></p>
                        <p>More than 1 fracture line and bone fragments are crushed or broken into several pieces.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Impacted fracture (telescoped) or compression fracture</strong></p>
                        <p>One bone fragment is forcibly driven into another adjacent bone fragment.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Pathologic fracture</strong></p>
                        <p>It occurs as a result of underlying bone disorder such as osteoporosis or tumor. Usually occurs with minimal trauma</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Green stick fracture</strong></p>
                        <p>One side of the bone is broken and the other side is bent. A fracture in which a fragment of bone has been pulled away by a ligament or tendon and its attachment.</p>
                        <p>NB A fracture may combine many of the above patterns e.g. a closed complete pathological fracture.</p>

                        <p>In long bones fractures are described as being proximal, distal as midshaft, based on their location on the bone.</p>
                        <p>A. Colle's fracture: - common fracture in which the distal radius is fractured within 1 inch of articullar surface.</p>
                        <p>B. Pott's fracture: - occurs to the medial malleolus of the tibia and fibula and often is associated with rapture of the internal lateral ligmament or chipping off a piece of the medial malleolus or both.</p>
                        <p>This two were named after the physician who first described them.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">ETIOLOGY</h3>
                        <p>The most common is direct trauma to the bone which may be caused by a motor vehicle accident and falls. Other causes include;-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Primary bone disease such as osteoporosis or metastatic bone cancer can weaken the bony structure and lead to fracture.</li>
                            <li>Direct force - the fracture occurs at the point of contact with an object.</li>
                            <li>The humerus when some one tries to throw a stone or disk in sport</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</h3>
                        <p>When a bone is broken, the periosteum and blood vessels in the cortex, marrow and surrounding tissue are disrupted and begin to bleed. A hematoma forms between the fractured ends of the bone and beneath the periosteum. Bone tissue immediately adjacent to the fracture dies. This necrotic tissue stimulates an intense inflammatory response characterized by vasodilation of plasma and leukocytes as well as increased production of prostaglandins.</p>
                        <p>All these factors lead to the symptoms and signs of pain, swelling and dysfunction.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-bone-healing" class="section-heading">BONE HEALING</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Bone unlike some other specialized tissues is able to regenerate. Fracture healing occurs by the formation of new none tissue. New bone is formed by the activation of osteoclast and osteoblasts. Fractures usually heal over 6 weeks in the following stages</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Stage 1; Hematoma formation</h3>
                        <p>In 24 hours the blood clots begins to organize. As the blood in the hematoma coagulates a loose delicate mesh of fibrin forms around the fracture site. This fibrin mesh protectively encloses the damaged bone and acts as a scaffold for the in growth of the capillary buds and fibroblasts. These new capillaries grow into the hematoma.</p>
                        <p>The main blood supply increases to the bone ends unlike most hematomas, this one does not resolve on healing by undergoes changes into granulation tissue.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Stage II Cellular Proliferation</h3>
                        <p>The cells at the bone ends proliferate from the periosteum, endosteum and the bone marrow. The injury to the periosteum stimulates the deep layers so that proliferation of the osteoblast takes place. After several days, osteogenesis and granulation of tissue forms a collar around the end of each fragments. The collars advances and eventually unite and form a bridge across the fracture.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Stage III Callus formation</h3>
                        <p>After 6-10 days after injury, the granulation tissue changes to the pre-callus. Newly formed cartilage and bone matrix (derived from the undamaged periosteum and endosteum) disperse through the soft tissue callus to form a provisional callus. This is made up of a large, loosely woven mass of bone and cartilage and is wider than the normal bone diameter. It secures the bone fragments but does not provide strength. It extends beyond the fracture line to form a splint. For uncomplicated fractures the size of the callus reaches its maximal size by 14-21 days after injury.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Stage IV Ossification</h3>
                        <p>A permanent callus of true rigid bone eventually forms by the deposition of calcium salts which knits the fracture ends together. Ossification first forms an external callus then an internal callus and finally an intermediate callus. During the 3<sup>rd</sup>-10<sup>th</sup> weeks of healing, the callus converts into bone. This formation of born firmly binds together the fractured ends and completes healing.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Stage V Consolidation and remodeling</h3>
                        <p>At the time bone is being formed the callus is remodeled by osteoclastic activity. In effect excess bone is chiseled away and absorbed from the callus. This remodeling is affected by the stress on it by muscles and weight bearing. This follows the Wolff's law, which basically states that a bone's structure is determined by its function, that is, the stresses and strains placed on it.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">HEALING TIME</h3>
                        <p>This varies with the</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Type of fracture- impacted and displaced fractures take longer.</li>
                            <li>Type of bone- spongy bone takes shorter time than compact bone e.g. arms 3 months while legs take 6 months.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Factors that enhance fracture healing.</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Immobilization of fracture fragments.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Arterial damage</strong> -contusion, thrombosis, severance, lacerations by the fracture or the cast. Arteries may be constricted by bandages or casts that are too tight.</p>
                                <p>Diagnosis is -absent pulse, swelling, pallor, patch cyanosis distal to fracture, blood loss, large fracture hematomas, cold extremity, poor capillary refill and anesthesia.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Compartment syndrome</strong></p>
                                <p>A compartment syndrome is a closed place which is made up of bones, muscles, nerves and blood vessels wrapped by a fibrous membrane. Bleeding or edema may occur within it thus exerting pressure on the pliable muscles, nerves and vessels. It can also occur due to external pressure from a tight dressing or cast. It is characterized by ischemic pain not relieved by narcotic analgesic and occurs on raising /elevation due to a decrease in arterial flow and also when touched. There also will be inactivity, absent pulses, coolness, parasthesias (needles and pins sensations) and pallor.</p>
                                <p>Management is by removing the cause e.g. cast or dressing and incase of edema or bleeding fasciotomy is done and the place left open until the edema or bleeding stops. If not managed on time it may lead to loss of the limb because of the need of amputation.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p><strong>Fat embolism</strong></p>
                                <p>A potentially life threatening condition occurs with fractures of long bones and the pelvis. It occurs 24-48 hours after injury and two theories explain is etiology.</p>
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Mechanical theory- trauma causes disruption of the fragile veins and the fat cells in the bone marrow. Fat globules enter the circulation aided by increased pressure from the hematoma at the fracture site.</li>
                                    <li>Biochemical - catecholamines released due to the stress of injury mobilizes lipids from the adipose tissue and makes them coalesce into large droplets which embolise the lung.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></p>
                                <p>Once the fat globules reach the lung they are unable to pass through its circulation. They lodge in the vessels and breakdown into FA. Free fatty acids are toxic to the lung parenchyma, capillary endothelium and the surfactant. The result is pulmonary hypertension.</p>

                                <p><strong>Infection</strong> -Due to contamination in open fractures or during surgery on the fractures. It may lead to delayed union, osteomylitis or gas gangrene. This may necessitate amputation</p>

                                <p><strong>Volkmann's Ischemic contracture</strong></p>
                                <p>This occurs in the arm and form as a result of fracture affecting the elbow or forearm bones. It begins as a compartment syndrome that compromises the arterial and venous circulation. This results in prolonged ischemia with degeneration of the muscle tissue and replacement with fibrous tissue. This fibrous tissue traps tendons and nerves. The typical result is a permanent, stiff, claw like deformity of the arm and the hand.</p>
                                <p>The Volkmann's contracture is most common with a supracondylar fracture of the humerus but can occur with crushing injuries or tight bandages. To avoid such deformity, compartment syndrome should be diagnosed and treated early.</p>

                                <p><strong>Delayed union</strong></p>
                                <p>This is failure of a fracture to consolidate within the required time frame. This occurs due to retardation of the healing process. It can be managed by additional time and the removal of the cause.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Nonunion</strong></p>
                                <p>It is the failure of a fracture site to consolidate and produce a complete, firm and stable union after 6-9months. It is characterized by excessive motion in the fracture site that leads to a false joint (pseudoarthrosis). Causes are similar to those of delayed. Management is by use of bone grafts.</p>

                                <p>This is the healing of a fracture site with an increased degree of angulation or deformity. If seen early in fracture healing it can be corrected with re-immobilization. Malunion after healing is usually corrected with surgery.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>To return limb to maximal function</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p>-Vital signs should be monitored closely because of the risk of shock due to hemorrhage, pain or embolism.</p>
                        <p>-Patient should be kept NPO depending on the type of fracture because there might be need for surgery.</p>
                        <p>-Ensure rest and rest may be also promoted by not using the affected parts like for fractures of the distal phalanges most often it is the only form of management for such fractures.</p>
                        <p>-There are <strong>3</strong> main forms of definitive management for fractures. These are;-</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">I) Reduction</h3>
                        <p>This is the restoration of the injured bone to the normal anatomic alignment, position and length. It also brings the fractured fragments together to promote healing. This is usually painful and requires anesthesia especially in complete displaced fractures or impacted ones.</p>
                        <p>Undisplaced fractures do not require reduction and may only require splinting to avoid displacement.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Types of reduction include</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Closed reduction/manipulation</strong>-In this case a physician brings the bone fragments into alignment without making a surgical incision. This may be done in 3 ways
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Traction and counter traction</li>
                                    <li>Angulation</li>
                                    <li>Rotation</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>This requires a lot of skill and x-ray films are taken to confirm alignment then a cast is usually applied to splint it.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Open reduction</strong>-An incision is made and fracture is aligned during surgery under direct vision. The time of surgery, various fixation devices may be applied to the fracture bone to maintain alignment (e.g. screws, plates, pins, wires, nails), or rods may be placed through bone fragments, fixed to the sides of the bone or inserted directly into the bone's medullary cavity.
                                <p>It is the treatment of choice in compound fractures that are comminuted and accompanied by serious neurovascular injuries, widely separated fragments or soft tissue interposition. It is also recommended for fracture of femur and of joints. Internal fixation helps immobilize a fracture and prevent deformity and is not a substitute for healing. So with time without bone healing they succumb to stress, loosen or break.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">II) Traction</h3>
                        <p>Therapeutic traction (pull) is accomplished by exerting a pull on the head, body or limbs in two directions i.e. pull of traction and of counter traction.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Traction is produced by weights</li>
                            <li>Counter traction by person's weight or other weights (pulleys, weight and ropes.)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The traction should</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Support and stretch the extremity in a direction that properly aligns bone fragments</li>
                            <li>Overstretch the limb</li>
                            <li>Maintain stretching forces that are constant until union of bones.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Traction is applied in the directions in line with the long axis of the bone while for the head and pelvis traction is in the direction of the spinal column.</p>
                        <p>With traction of the long limbs the bed is elevated so as to reduce the amount of counter traction required. Thus only the person's body is needed.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE TRACTION.</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Traction must be continuous to be effective in reducing and immobilizing fractures.</li>
                            <li>Skeletal traction is never interrupted.</li>
                            <li>Weight is not removed unless intermittent traction is prescribed.</li>
                            <li>Any factor that might reduce the effective pull or alter its resultant line of pull must be eliminated.</li>
                            <li>For traction to be effective there must be counter traction i.e. force acting in the opposite direction.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>There are two main forms of traction</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Skin traction</strong>- strapping (legs), anklets, corsets (pelvic fracture) and halters (on the head for cervical problems) are used to apply traction on particular parts of the body. It is used to immobilize an area before surgery and control muscle spasms. the amount of weight applied must not exceed the tolerance of the skin no more than 23.5 KG of traction can be used on an extremity. Pelvic traction is usually 4.5-9 KGS depending on the weight of the patient</li>
                            <li><strong>Skeletal traction</strong>- metal wires or pins are surgically inserted into bones or metals tongs anchored in the skull. The weights are attached to the pin or wire by a rope and pulley system that exerts the appropiriate amount and direction of pull for effective traction. It frequently uses 7-12 KGS.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Example of types of traction</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Buck's traction</strong>-It is a form of skin traction exerted by the pull on one or both legs. It is used to immobilize a limb for a short time while waiting for another form of management like hip replacement or to reduce muscle spasm.<p>Other uses include TB of the hip, arthritis and pelvic injuries. It is contraindicated in diabetic gangrene, stasis dermatitis and serious varicosities.</p>
                            <p>A fabricated boot (cast) not restricting movement of the ankle is put 1 to 2 inches below the knee. The traction is usually continuous. Incase there is need to charge the weights, manual traction should be applied while the change is being made.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Cervical traction</strong> - It holds the head in extension to treat muscles sprains, strains and spasm and is usually applied with a head halter. Skeletal cervical traction using skull tongs or a halo apparatus may be used in stabilizing fracture or dislocations of the cervical or upper thoracic spine. A halo consists of a head piece with four pins, two anterior and two posterior. The head piece attaches to a body jacket. The purpose is immobilization and currently they are rarely used.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pelvic traction</strong> accomplished with a belt applied just above and encircling the iliac crests. The belt attaches to the spreader bar and pulley system. Traction is applied to the lumber spine.</li>
                            <li><strong>Russell's traction</strong>-this is a modification of the buck's traction. It adds a vertical pull by placing a sling under the leg above the knee. It is used to immobilize hip fracture or the shaft of the femur.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Potential complications.</h4>
                        <p>Skin break down: - which results from irritation caused by contact of the skin with the tape foam and shearing forces.</p>
                        <p>Nerve pressure: - results from pressure on the peripheral nerves. Circulatory impairment: - which is usually manifested by cold skin temperature, decreased peripheral pulses, slow capillary refill time and bluish skin.</p>
                        <p>Others are:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Anorexia.</li>
                            <li>Constipation.</li>
                            <li>Urinary stasis and infection.</li>
                            <li>Venous stasis with DVT.</li>
                            <li>Pneumonia.</li>
                            <li>Pressure ulcers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">III) Casting</h3>
                        <p>They are temporary devices made from plaster of Paris or fiber glass that are used to immobilize a body part, usually an extremity. Its purpose is</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Immobilize a reduced fracture.</li>
                            <li>Prevent or correct deformities e.g. talipes equinoverus.</li>
                            <li>Maintenance of support and protection to realign bone.</li>
                            <li>Promotion of healing which allows early weight bearing for ambulation.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Types of casts</h4>
                        <p><strong>Short arm</strong>- extends from thumb and palm to mid arm. Used to treat fracture distal radius, humerus as a hanging cast, wrist sprains and carpal fractures.</p>
                        <p><strong>Short leg</strong>- used to treat fracture of the tibia, fibula and ankle. It extends from foot to hip and holds knee in flexion if fracture is unstable to prevent weight bearing. If eight permitted a cylinder cast is used</p>
                        <p><strong>Cast brace</strong>- it is used to treat a stable distal femur fracture. Has two parts above and below knee with a hinge to allow knee joint movement.</p>
                        <p><strong>Body cast:</strong>- encircles the trunk</p>
                        <p><strong>Hip spica</strong>- used to treat fracture of the hip and to immobilize the hip. Cast extends from mid trunk to foot or feet, hips abducted with a bar. An opening is made for elimination.</p>
                        <p><strong>Walking cast:</strong>- ashort or long leg cast reinforced for strength</p>
                        <p><strong>Shoulder spica cast:</strong>- abody jacket that encloses the trunk,shoulder and elbow</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">ASSESSMENT BEFORE APPLYING THE CAST.</h4>
                        <p>The nurse completes an assessment of the patient general health, presenting signs and symptoms, emotional status, understanding the need for the cast and condition of the body part to be immobilized in the cast. The physical assessment of the part to be immobilizes must include assessment of the neurovascular status (neurologic and circulatory functioning) of the body part, degree and location of swelling, bruising and skin abrasion.</p>

                        <p><strong>Explaining the treatment regimen.</strong></p>
                        <p>Before applying the cast the patient needs information concerning the pathological problem and the purpose and expectations of the prescribed treatment regimen. Preparation of the patient for application of the cast by describing the anticipated sights sounds and sensations e.g. heat from the hardening reaction of plaster.</p>
                        <p><strong>Relieving pain.</strong></p>
                        <p>The patient should elevate the affected part, apply cold as prescribed and administer usual dosages of analgesics.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">✓</span><span class="item-text">Pain associated with the disease process is controlled by immobilization.</span></li>

                        <p><strong>Improving mobility.</strong></p>
                        <p>Every joint that is not immobilized should be exercised and moved through its range of motion to maintain function. If the patient has a leg cast, the nurse encourages exercising. If the patient has an arm cast, the nurse encourages finger exercise.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Maintaining adequate neurovascular function.</strong></p>

                        <p>NB; The nurse should never ignore complains of pain from the patient in cast because of the possibility of potential problems such as impaired tissue perfusion or pressure ulcer formation.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Monitoring and managing potential complications.</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><p><strong>Compartment syndrome.</strong></p>
                                <p>It occurs when there is increased tissue pressure within a limited space that compromises the circulation and the function of tissue within the confined area.</p>
                                <p>To relieve the pressure the cast must be cut into half longitudinally while maintaining alignment and the extremity must be elevated no higher than heart level.</p>
                                <p>The nurse records neurovascular responses and promptly reports changes to the physician.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p><strong>Pressure ulcers.</strong></p>
                                <p>It may cause tissue anoxia and pressure ulcers. Lower extremity sites most susceptible to pressure are the heel, head of the fibula, dorsum of the foot and anterior surface of the patella.</p>
                                <p>The patient usually reports of pain and tightness in the area.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p><strong>Disuse syndrome.</strong></p>
                                <p>It occurs due to inability to use the affected area. The nurse assists the patient to learn to tense or contract muscles without moving the affected part, this helps to reduce muscle atrophy and maintain muscle strength.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p>When the cast is dry the patient is instructed as follows:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Move about as normally as possible, but avoid excessive use of the injured extremity and avoid walking on wet, slippery floor.</li>
                            <li>Perform prescribed exercise regularly.</li>
                            <li>Elevate the casted extremity to heart level frequently to prevent swelling.</li>
                            <li>Don't attempt to scratch the skin under the cast because it may cause break in the skin and hence result in the formation of skin ulcer.</li>
                            <li>Keep the cast dry but do not cover it with plastic or rubber because this causes condensation which dampens the cast and skin.</li>
                            <li>Report any of the following to the nurse: persistent pain, swelling that does not respond to elevation, change in sensation , decreased ability to move exposed fingers or toes and changes in skin color and temperature.</li>
                            <li>Note odors around the cast, stained areas, warm spots and pressure areas.</li>
                            <li>Report a broken cast to the physician; do not attempt to fix it yourself.</li>

                        <p>Before the cast is applied, it is important to treat skin lacerations and abrasions to promote healing. The nurse thoroughly cleans the skin and treats it as prescribed. Sterile dressings are used to cover the injured skin. If the skin wounds are extensive, an alternative method (eg, external fixator) may be chosen to immobilize the body part.</p>
                        <p>While the cast is on, the nurse observes the patient for systemic signs of infection, odors from the cast, and purulent drainage staining the cast</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">MAINTAINING ADEQUATE NEUROVASCULAR FUNCTION</h3>
                        <p>The nurse monitors circulation, motion, and sensation of the affectedextremity, assessing the fingers or toes of the casted extremity andcomparing them with those of the opposite extremity. Normal findings include minimal swelling, minimal discomfort, pink color, warm to touch, rapid capillary refill response, normal sensations, and ability to exercise fingers or toes. The nurse encourages the patient to move fingers or toes hourly when awake to stimulate circulation.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">MONITORING AND MANAGING POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Compartment Syndrome</h4>
                        <p>To relieve the pressure, the cast must be bivalved (cut in half longitudinally) while maintaining alignment, and the extremity must be elevated no higher than heart level If pressure is not relieved and circulation is not restored, a fasciotomy may be necessary to relieve the pressure within the muscle compartment</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pressure Ulcers</h4>
                        <p>Pressure of the cast on soft tissues may cause tissue anoxia and pressure ulcers Usually, the patient with a pressure ulcer reports pain and tightness in the area. A warm area on the cast suggests underlying tissue erythema. The area may break down. The drainage may stain the cast and emit an odor. monitor the patient with a cast for pressure ulcer development and report findings to the physician.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Disuse Syndrome</h4>
                        <p>While in a cast, the patient needs to learn to tense or contract muscles (eg, isometric muscle contraction) without moving the part Isometric exercises should be performed hourly while the patient is awake</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">HEALTH EDUCATION.</h3>
                        <p>When the cast is dry, the nurse instructs the patient as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Move about as normally as possible, but avoid excessive use of the injured extremity and avoid walking on wet, slippery floors or sidewalks.</li>
                            <li>Perform prescribed exercises regularly, as scheduled.</li>
                            <li>Elevate the casted extremity to heart level frequently to prevent swelling.</li>
                            <li>Do not attempt to scratch the skin under the cast. This may cause a break in the skin and result in the formation of a skin ulcer. Cool air from a hair dryer may alleviate an itch.</li>
                            <li>Cushion rough edges of the cast with tape.</li>
                            <li>Keep the cast dry but do not cover it with plastic or rubber,because this causes condensation, which dampens the cast and skin. Moisture softens a plaster cast. (A wet fiberglass cast must be dried thoroughly with a hair dryer on a cool setting to avoid skin problems.)</li>
                            <li>Report any of the following to the physician: persistent pain, swelling that does not respond to elevation, changes in sensation, decreased ability to move exposed fingers or toes, and changes in skin color and temperature.</li>
                            <li>Note odors around the cast, stained areas, warm spots, and pressure areas. Report them to the physician.</li>
                            <li>Report a broken cast to the physician; do not attempt to fix it .</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The nurse prepares the patient for cast removal or cast changes by explaining what to expect</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">BODY OR SPICA CASTS</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The nurse positions the pillows next to each other, because spaces between pillows allow the damp cast to sag,become weak, and possibly break.</li>
                            <li>A pillow is not placed under the head and shoulders of a patient in a body cast while the cast is drying, because doing so causes pressure on the chest.</li>
                            <li>The nurse turns the patient as a unit toward the uninjured side every 2 hours to relieve pressure and to allow the cast to dry</li>
                            <li>A stabilizing abduction bar incorporated into a spica cast should not be used as a turning device.</li>
                            <li>The nurse adjusts the pillows to provide support without creating areas of pressure.</li>
                            <li>The skin can be bathed and massaged by reaching under the cast edges with the fingers.</li>
                            <li>The perineal opening must be large enough for hygienic care.</li>
                            <li>Cast syndrome: psychological the nurse needs to recognize the anxiety reaction and provide an environment in which the patient feels secure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The physiologic cast syndrome responses (superior mesenteric artery syndrome) are associated with immobility in a body cast. With decreased physical activity, gastrointestinal motility decreases, intestinal gases accumulate, intestinal pressure increases, and ileus may occur. The patient exhibits abdominal distention, abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting If the cast restricts the abdomen, the abdominal window must be enlarged monitor bowel sounds.</p>

                        <p>It is a common injury that results from a direct blow to the shoulder or a fall.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                        <p><strong>When not disrupted</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A clavicular strap /figure of 8 bandages may be used to pull the shoulder back, reducing and immobilizing the fractures. When used the axillae are well padded to prevent compression injury to the brachial plexus and the axillae artery.</li>
                            <li>The nurse monitors the circulation and nerve function of both arms.</li>
                            <li>A sling may be used to support the arm and to relieve pain.</li>
                            <li>The nurse cautions the patient not to elevate the arm above the shoulder level until the ends of the bone have united but encourage the patient to exercise the elbow, wrist and fingers.</li>
                            <li>Vigorous activities are limited for 3 months.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When disrupted open reduction with internal fixation is done (ORIF)</p>
                        <p>Complications :- trauma to the nerves of the brachial plexus, injury to the subclavian vein or artery from a bony fragment and malunion</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">HUMERAL NECK</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The arm is supported and immobilized by a sling and swathe that secure the supported arm trunk.</li>
                            <li>A soft pad is placed to absorb moisture and avoid skin breakdown.</li>
                            <li>This fracture takes 6-10 weeks to heal so the patient should avoid vigorous activities e.g. tennis for additional 4 weeks.</li>
                            <li>Circumduction exercise should be performed as soon as tolerated.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When the fracture is displaced treatment of colsed reduction,ORIF are the best</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">HUMERAL SHAFT</h3>
                        <p>They are mostly caused by:-</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Direct trauma that results in transverse, oblique, or comminuted fracture.</li>
                            <li>In direct twisting force that result in spiral fracture.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management.</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Well padded splints overwrapped with an elastic bandage are used to immobilize the upper arm and to support the arm in 90 degrees of flexion at the elbow.</li>
                            <li>External fixations are used to treat open fractures of the humeral shaft</li>
                            <li>Functional bracing is another treatment which allows active use of muscles</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Complication: - delayed union and nonunion because of decreased blood supply in that area</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">ELBOW</h3>
                        <p>They result from motor vehicle crashes, falls on the elbow or direct blow. These fractures may result in injury to the median, radial, or ulnar nerves.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                        <p>The goal is to promote reduction and stabilization of the distal humerus fracture, followed by controlled active motion after swelling has subsided and healing has begun. If the fracture is not displaced, the arm is immobilized in a cast or posterior splint with the elbow at 45 or 90 degrees of flexion and in a sling for 4-6 weeks. Then a thermoplastic splint is used to support the fracture and a rehabilitation exercise has begun.</p>
                        <p>If it is displaced it is treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF)</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Active exercise of the elbow is performed as prescribed to prevent residual limitation of motion.</li>
                            <li>Active finger exercise are encouraged</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Complication: compartment syndrome, volkmann's contracture which results from antecubital swelling or damage to the brachial artery hemarthrosis (blood in the joint) if it is present they may aspirate the joint to remove the blood, thereby relieving the pressure and pain.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">RADIAL HEAD</h3>
                        <p>They are common and are usually produced by a fall on the outstretched hand with the elbow extended.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management.</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If blood has collected in the elbow joint it is aspirated to relieve pain and allow early active elbow and forearm ROM.</li>
                            <li>Immobilization of these with a splint and instruct the patient not to lift the arm for approximately 4 weeks.</li>
                            <li>If the fracture is displaced surgery is required, with excision of the radial head where necessary. Post operatively the arm is immobilized in a posterior plaster splint and sling. Encourage the patient to carry out active motion of the elbow and fore arm as prescribed.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">RADIAL AND ULNAR SHAFTS</h3>
                        <p>They occur frequently in children. The radius or the ulna may be fractured at any level.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If it is not displaced, the fracture is treated by closed reduction with a long arm cast applied from the upper arm to the proximal palmer crease.Asses for circulation, motion, and sensation of the hand after the cast are applied. The arm is elevated to control edema. Frequent finger flexion and extension are encouraged to reduce edema.</li>
                            <li>The fracture is immobilized for about 12 weeks, lifting and twisting are avoided.</li>
                            <li>Displaced fracture are managed by orif using compression plate with crews</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">RIBS</h3>
                        <p>Uncomplicated fracture of the ribs occurs frequently in adults and usually results in no impairment of function. These fracture produce painful respiration, the patient tends to decrease respiratory excursions and refrains from coughing. To help this patient cough and take deep breaths, the nurse may splint the chest with her hands. The doctor may administer intercostals nerve block to relieve pain and to permit productive coughing.</p>
                        <p>Chest strapping to immobilize the rib fracture is not used, because decreased chest expansion may result in pneumonia and atelectasis. The pain may diminish significantly in 3-4 days and the fracture may heal within 6weeks.</p>
                        <p>Complications:- Atelectasis,pneumonia,flail chect,pneumothorax and hemothorax</p>

                        <p>Pain, deformity, hematoma and considerable hematoma.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Assessment and diagnostic findings</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Peroneal nerve damage is assessed. If is affected the patient is unable to dorsiflex the great toe and has diminished sensation in the first web space.</li>
                            <li>Tibial artery damage is assessed by evaluating pulses, skin temperature and color by testing the capillary refill response.</li>
                            <li>The patient is monitored for an anterior compartment syndrome. Symptoms include pain unrelieved by medication and increasing with planter flexion.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Medical management</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Closed fractures are treated with closed reduction and immobilization in a long leg walking cast.</li>
                            <li>Partial weight bearing is usually prescribed after 7-10 days</li>
                            <li>The cast is changed to a short leg cast or brace in 3-4 weeks which allows for knee motion for activity which decreases edema and increases circulation.</li>
                            <li>Comminuted fractures may be treated with skeletal traction, internal fixation with intramedullary nails or plates and screws or intertenal fixation.</li>
                            <li>Hip, foot and knee exercise are encouraged within the limits of the immobilizing device</li>
                            <li>Open fractures are treated with external fixation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Complications: compartment syndrome, delayed union, infection, impaired wound edge healing due to limited soft tissue, and loosening of the internal fixation hardware.</p>

                        <p>The sacrum, ilium, pubis and ischium bones form the pelvic bone. Falls motor vehicle crashes and crush injuries can cause pelvic fractures. There is high mortality a associated with pelvic fractures related to hemorrhage, pulmonary complications, fat emboli, intravascular coagulation, thromboembolic complication and infection.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Signs and symptoms</h4>
                        <p>Ecchymosis; tenderness over the symphysis pubis, anterior iliac spines, iliac crest, sacrum or coccyx; local swelling; numbness or tingling of pubis, genetals, and proximal thighs; and inability to bear weight without discomfort.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Diagnosis.</h4>
                        <p>Computer tomography of the pelvis helps to determine the extent of injury by demonstrating sacroiliac joint disruption, soft tissue trauma, pelvic hematoma and fractures.</p>

                        <p>It depends on the severity of the fracture.</p>
                        <p>Unstable ,weight bearing pelvic fractures are treated with external fixation devices and through open reduction with internal fixation.</p>
                        <p>Less severe fractures of non-weight- bearing portions can be successfully treated with bed rest and traction.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>There are 3 classes of strains</p>
                        <p><strong>First degree strain</strong> -it is a gradual onset of muscle spasms, discomfort and loss of range of motion. No edema or ecchymosis is present. It involves pulling of the musculotendinous unit.</p>
                        <p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> degree strain</strong>- is identified by extreme muscle spasms; pain and edema develop immediately after injury. The area remains tender after acute symptoms subside. Ecchymosis develops within a few hours this strain involves tearing or straining of the musculotendinous unit.</p>
                        <p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> degree strain</strong>- there is severe muscle spasm, point tenderness and edema at the site of injury, there is a sensation of sudden tearing or burning and there is a limited range of movement. This usually represents a complete rupture of the musculotendinous unit.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Bursitis and tendinitis</h4>
                        <p>They are inflammatory conditions that commonly occur in the shoulder. Buresae are fluid filled sacs that prevent friction between joint structures during joint activity. When inflamed they are painful. Similarly, muscle tendon sheaths became inflamed with repetitive stretching. The inflammation causes proliferation of synovial membrane and Pannus formation, which restricts joint movement.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                        <p>Conservative treatment includes: - rest of extremity, intermittent ice and heat to the joint and NSAIDs to control the pain and inflammation.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Loose bodies</h4>
                        <p>They may occur in a joint as a result of articular cartilage wear and bone erosion, these fragments interfere with joint movement, locking the joint and cause painful movements. Loose bodies are removed by arthroscopic surgery.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Ganglion.</h4>
                        <p>It is a round firm projection, usually near the wrist. It is a collection of gelatinous material near the tendon sheaths and joints. It is caused by strains, contusions or a series or repeated minor strains as a result of which the tissues of the sheath or sac involved have gradually become weakened and distended. The ganglion is painless, but an affected joint is often weak and moderately painful secondary to local pressure.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Aspiration or excision.</li>
                            <li>Aspiration decompression may need to be repeated since fluid may accumulate.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Carpal tunnel syndrome</h4>
                        <p>It is an entrapment neuropathy caused by pressure from a thickened flexor tendon sheath, skeletal encroachment or soft tissue mass on the median nerve at the wrist.</p>
                        <p><strong>Signs and symptoms</strong></p>
                        <p>Numbness, pain, paresthesia and possible weakness along the median nerve (thumb, first and second fingers)</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rest splint</li>
                            <li>Avoidance of work that requires flexion of the wrist may relieve the symptoms.</li>
                            <li>Surgical release of the transverse carpal ligament may be necessary.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Dupuytren's contracture.</h4>
                        <p>It is a slowly progressive contracture of the palmer fascia causing flexion of the little finger, the ring finger and frequently the middle fingers; which renders them more or less useless.</p>
                        <p>It starts as thickening of the palmer fascia. The fibrous thickening extends to involve the skin in the distal palm and produces a contracture of the finger to which the palmer fascia is inserted.</p>
                        <p><strong>Risk factors</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>People of Scandinavian or Northern European ancestry; it has been called the "Viking disease" or "Celtic hand", though it is also widespread in some Mediterranean countries (e.g., Spain and Bosnia) and in Japan;</li>
                            <li>Men rather than women (men are ten times as likely to develop the condition);</li>
                            <li>People over the age of 40;</li>
                            <li>People with a family history ( 60% to 70% of those afflicted have a genetic predisposition to Dupuytren's contracture);</li>
                            <li>People with liver cirrhosis.</li>
                            <li>Some suspected, but unproven, causes of Dupuytren's contracture include trauma, diabetes, alcoholism, epilepsy therapy with phenytoin, and liver disease.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Tennis elbow</h4>
                        <p>It is a painful condition that is due to excessive pronation and supination activities of the forearm. The pain characteristically radiates down the extensor surface of the forearm.</p>
