                        <p>Based on the concept of random selection. The goal is to select a reasonable No. of subjects, objects or cases that represent the target population.</p>
                        <p>Previous studies have indicated that probability sampling can provide us with accurate information about groups that are too large to study in their entity.</p>
                        <p>Provides us with an efficient system of capturing, in a small group, the variations or heterogeneity that exist in the target population.</p>

                        <p>Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected in the sample.</p>
                        <p>Best applicable where a list of the sampling frame is available.</p>
                        <p>It assures randomness. eg, using lottery number & by use of table of random numbers.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Systematic Random Sampling</h3>
                        <p>Every kth case in the frame is selected for inclusion in the sample.</p>
                        <p>To obtain a truly random sample using this method, the list of all the members in sampling frame must be randomized.</p>
                        <p>Once a population frame is randomized, the researcher then decides on sampling interval (distance btw the cases that are selected for the sample).</p>
                        <p>Rule of thumb in deciding the sampling interval is to divide the total population by the sample size.</p>
                        <p>In this method all sections of the population are adequately represented.</p>
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Simple and convenient: Results generally satisfactory.</li>
                            <li>Gives similar results to those of stratified random samp.</li>
                            <li>Independent. Sample obtained is the true representative sample as this method of selection is dependent on the property of population under study.</li>
                            <li>Little chances of bias.</li>
                            <li>Helps in random selection.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>High chances of sampling error if there is periodicity pattern.</li>
                            <li>Works only for random population.</li>
                            <li>Not suitable for large population.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Stratified Random Sampling</h3>
                        <p>The goal of this is to achieve desired representation from various subgroups in the population. In this, subjects are selected in such a way that the existing subgroups in the population are more or less reproduced in the sample.</p>
                        <p>Involves a method where a larger population can be divided into smaller groups, that usually don't overlap but represent the entire population together.</p>
                        <p>A common method is to arrange or classify by sex, age, ethnicity & similar ways.</p>
                        <p>Random sample is taken from each stratum, the whole pop is adequately represented.</p>
                        <p>For greater accuracy in the findings, the No. in each stratum should be based on the relative variability of the xtics under study rather than proportionate to the relative size of each subgroup in the population. eg male & female, if female have more variability choos</p>
                        <h4>Steps involved:</h4>
                        <p>Steps involved in stratified random sampling are the same as those in simple random sampling. However the sampling frame has to be identified in divided into the defined strata.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Identify the population.</li>

                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Accurately reflects the population being studied becoz researchers are stratifying the entire population by applying random sampling method.</li>
                            <li>Ensures each subgroup in popln receives proper representation within the sample.</li>
                            <li>provides better coverage of the population since the researchers have control over the subgroups to ensure all of them are represented in the sampling.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <p>Several conditions must be met for it to be used properly:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Researcher must identify every member of a population being studied and classify each of them into one and only one, subpopulation.</li>
                            <li>Disadvantageous when researchers cannot confidently classify every member of the population into a subgroup.</li>
                            <li>Finding an exhaustive & definitive list of an entire population can be challenging.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4. Cluster Sampling</h3>
                        <p>Used when it is not possible to obtain a sampling frame becoz the population is either very large or scattered over a large geographical area.</p>
                        <p>Usually analyzes a particular population in which the sample consists of more than a few elements eg. city.</p>
                        <p>All the members of such an intact group are the included in the sample & each member becomes a unit of observation.</p>
                        <p>In cluster sampling, it is the groups or clusters that are randomly selected & not the individuals or cases.</p>
                        <p>Used when it is too expensive to spread out your sample across the population as a whole.</p>
                        <h4>Cluster sampling involves:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Identify the population.</li>
                            <li>Define the cluster forming the population.</li>
                            <li>Determine the required sample size.</li>
                            <li>list all the clusters in a random order.</li>
                            <li>Using the table of random No, select the required No of clusters according to the sample size.</li>
                            <li>All members in the selected clusters are included in the sample as units of observations.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Reduced costs</li>
                            <li>Simplified field work</li>

                        <p>A modification of cluster sampling. It involves a process of drawing samples from selected clusters - sub-sampling.</p>
                        <p>It can be two-stage, 3 stage etc.</p>
                        <p>Example: province -> district -> division -> location.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Purposive (Judgement) Sampling</h3>
                        <p>Allows a researcher to use cases that have the required information with respect to the objectives of his/her study.</p>
                        <p>Cases of subjects are therefore, hand picked becoz they are informative or they possess the required xtics.</p>
                        <p>The researcher must specify the criteria for choosing a particular case.</p>
                        <p>Some researchers used this method as part of multi-stage sampling procedures.</p>

                        <p>Is similar to stratified random sampling & the objective is to include various groups or quotas of the population.</p>
                        <p>The selection of actual participants is not random since subjects are picked as they fit into identified quotas.</p>
                        <p>eg Religion (20% muslim, 5% Jews, 30% christians etc).</p>
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Can be executed in lesser time than that in any random method of sampling & hence it saves capital in research.</li>
                            <li>Researcher has total control over chosen samples, since it is the researcher only who decides what to choose.</li>
                            <li>Can be applied independently - no follow up.</li>
