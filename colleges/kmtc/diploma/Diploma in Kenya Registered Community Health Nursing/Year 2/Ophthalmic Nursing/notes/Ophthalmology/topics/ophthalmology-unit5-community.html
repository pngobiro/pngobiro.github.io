                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> It is lens opacity that causes visual impairment or blindness. The word cataract is derived from Latin "catarracta" which means "water fall".</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Epidemiology</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Around 19.34 million people are bilaterally blind (less than 3/60 in the better eye) from age related cataract. This represents 43% of all blindness.</li>
                            <li>The number of blind people in the world and the proportion due to cataract is increasing due to:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Population growth</li>
                                    <li>Increasing longevity.</li>

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The result of these two factors means that the population aged over 60 years will double during the next 20 yrs from approximately 400 million now, to around 800 million in 2020. This increase in the elderly population will result in a greater number of the people with visual loss and blindness from cataract that will need eye services. A figure of 1000 new blind people from cataract per million populations per year is used for planning purpose in developing countries.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Very common disease, particularly in developing countries.</li>
                            <li>Affects about 600 million people</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How does the disease develop?</h3>
                        <p>Trachoma tends to be found in dry rural areas, where lack of water and bad living conditions may facilitate the spread of the disease.</p>
                        <p>In communities where trachoma is common, infection starts in early childhood. The first signs can be found in children of less than one year old.Trachmatos inflammation becomes increasingly intense in children up to the age of six to eight years. Scars on the inside of the eye lids, caused by trachoma, can be found in children from the age of four years. Scarring is increasingly common in older children, but the serious complication of inturned eye lashes and corneal scarring do not usually appear before adult age. Thus, blindness due to trachoma is most common in adults.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Trachoma in the community</h3>
                        <p>The severity of trachoma can vary from one community to another because of differences in the eases of spread of infection. Repeated infections with C. trachomatis, or other causes of conjunctivitis, increase the intensity of inflammation, which leads to more scarring and blindness. Children are the main reservoir of Trachomatous infection, as they are commonly and heavily infected. Compared to men, women tend to have more severe trachoma, including inturned eyelashes and blindness, probably re infected by children for whom they care.</p>

                            <li>To enable health workers to assist in undertaking simple surveys to identify communities in need of measures to control blindness from trachoma.</li>

                            <li>The proportion of Trachomatous inflammation (TF, 20% or more with, or without TI ) amongst children less than 10 years; this demonstrates how wide spread the infection is in the community</li>
                            <li>The proportion of intense Trachomatous inflammation (TI, 5% or more) in children less than 10 years; this demonstrates how severe the disease is in the community</li>
                            <li>The proportion of conjunctival scarring (TS); this demonstrates how common trachoma was in the past</li>
                            <li>The number of people with Trichiasis ( 1% or more); this indicates the immediate need to provide surgical services for lid correction</li>
                            <li>The proportion of people with corneal opacity (corneal blindness more than 0.1%); this demonstrates the impact of trachoma in the community in terms of visual loss.</li>

Most of the refraction in the eye is done by the cornea ( 2/3 ) the rest being by the lens ( 1/3 )</p>

                        <p>The current estimate suggests that there are 1.4 million children blind globally, 22.9% live in sub Saharan Africa making a total number of 320,000 blind children in that part of the world. Many of the causes of blindness in children are also a cause of child mortality( e.g. measles, Vitamin A deficiency, congenital rubella syndrome, cerebral malaria ,head injuries, tumors).This means that many children who become blind die within a few years of becoming blind. As the prevalence of blindness is a measure of those blind children who survive. It underestimates the magnitude of the problem.</p>
