                        <p>This lecture note will serve as a practical guideline for the hard-pressed mid-level health workers. We hope that it will be a good introduction to eye diseases for health science students working in Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>There are so many books about eye diseases available but hardly any, which are written from the perspective of Ethiopia, where more blind are live.</p>
                        <p>The lecture note is basically focused on the community as well as clinical ophthalmology to introduce the students on the common causes and burden of blindness and their preventive aspect. So it is written for students who are intended to see patients and need to recognize each disease and recommend possible treatment. When looking at a patient with eye disease, the most important skill is to be able to recognize the appearance of each particular disease.</p>
                        <p>In the management of diseases which are beyond their scope are recommended to refer as early as possible. They shouldn't urge to start to manage such patients at their level. Their main role is to pick problems early and to have an active role in the prevention of blindness. Selected pictures are used to illustrate some anatomical parts and common eye diseases to make note easier and understandable.</p>
                        <p>There are several encouraging signs that there is an increasing awareness of the challenge of treatable and preventable blindness throughout the world. Our country is forming prevention of blindness to try to look realistically at the problem locally. NGO's and the government are highly devoted to treat and prevent major cause of blindness in the country specially cataract and trachoma.</p>
                        <p>In spite of all this, the number of avoidably blind people in Ethiopia continues to increase faster than the population.</p>

                        <p>The eye is the most amazing and complex structure in the body . The two eyes provide about half the total sensory input from the entire body into the brain. The eye is sensitive to trauma, infection or inflammation that may end up in blindness. Just as the blind spot is neglected by the brain, about 45 million people in the world who are blind are largely neglected by medical science and technology, and by the caring professionals; of this 80% is preventable. The situation in Ethiopia is similar with prevalence of blindness being about 1.5% and an estimated around 1.05 million blind people. .Blindness has, directly or indirectly, social as well as economical impact. The causes are multifactorial. In order to address these multifactorial causes, all rounded and effective approach is needed.</p>
                        <p>Above all there are few ophthalmologists and other ophthalmic workers in relation to population. So the need for skilled man- power that will involve specially at preventable level is undoubted. For this, problem oriented training is mandatory in order to overcome ophthalmic health problems in the country. The care taker should be aware of its sensitivity. This can be done by early management at the first level of health institute or by appropriate referral</p>
                        <p>There are many reference books about ophthalmic diseases but most are not written with regard to our country's situation where most blind people live. To alleviate this problem, Ophthalmology Department of Gondar University has got a full support from carter center. Thus, this teaching material was prepared. It was tried to focus on common ophthalmic problems and major causes of blindness so that this document will serve as a practical guideline for mid-level health workers. The lecture note will give the students pertinent knowledge and practice about prevention of blindness. It contains seven chapters.</p>
                        <p><strong>Each chapter contains:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Objectives at the beginning of the chapters which are intended to guide the students in their study.</li>
                            <li>The body with detail notes</li>
                            <li>Exercises related to it and suggested references.</li>
