                            <li>Patient should sit at 6 meters</li>
                            <li>Start with the right eye by closing the left eye with palm of the hand.</li>
                            <li>Use commonly 'E' chart and ask the patient to show the direction of the 'E' (right, left, up or down) and then record the last line that the patient sees.</li>

                            <li>The human finger is about the same size as the top letter on the chart, so counting fingers at 6 meters is about equal to 6/60 vision, and abbreviated as CF</li>
                            <li>If vision is below 1/60, use the patient to detect motion of hand in front of the eye; 'hand motion' (HM)</li>
                            <li>If the patient can't see HM, the final test is to shine a light into his eye</li>

                            <li>Projection of the light from four quadrants of the eyes should be examined to test the peripheral retina and optic nerve function.</li>

                            <li>Pin hole test - If V/A improves with this test, it usually indicates an error of refraction; But if not corrected, then loss of visual acuity is from other eye diseases.</li>

                        <p>Ophthalmoscope is a form of illumination, which allows the examiner to look down the same axis as the rays of light entering the patient's eye. To see the fundus</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ocular media must be healthy and transparent</li>
                            <li>Dilate the pupil with mydriatic drops</li>
                            <li>With the ophthalmoscope it appears 15 times larger than its actual size</li>
                            <li>In myopic patient the magnification is greater, but in hypermetropic patient it is less.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">How to use ophthalmoscope</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hold closer both to the examiner's and to the patient's eye</li>
                            <li>If the patient has spectacles, he has to put it off.</li>
                            <li>If the examiner wears spectacles, he should keep it.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
                        <ol type="A">
                            <li>For examination of the right eye, sit or stand at the patient's right side.</li>
                            <li>Select "O" on the illuminated lens dial of the ophthalmoscope and start with small aperture.</li>
                            <li>Take the ophthalmoscope in the right hand and hold it vertically in front of your own right eye with the light beam directed toward the patient and place your right index finger on the edge of the lens dial so that you will be able to change lenses easily if necessary.</li>
                            <li>Dim room lights. Instruct the patient to look straight ahead at a distant object.</li>
                            <li>Position the ophthalmoscope about 6 inches ( 15 cm ) in front and slightly to the right (25°) of the patient and direct the light beam into the pupil. A "reflex" should appear as you look through the pupil.</li>
                            <li>Rest the left hand on the patient's forehead and hold the upper lid of the eye near the eyelashes with the thumb. While the patient holds his fixation on the specified object, keep the "reflex" in view and slowly move toward the patient. The optic disc should come into view when you are about 1 and 1/2 to 2 inches (3-5 cm) from the patient. If it is not focused clearly, rotate lenses into the aperture with your index finger until the optic disc is clearly visible as possible. The hyperopic, or farsighted, eye requires more" plus"(black numbers)sphere for clear focus; the myopic, or near-sighted, eye requires " minus"(red numbers) sphere for clear focus.</li>
                            <li>Now examine the disc for clarity of outline, color, elevating and condition of the vessels. Follow each vessel as far to the periphery as you can. To locate the macula, focus on the disc, then move the light approximately 2 disc diameters temporally. You may also have the patient look at the light of the ophthalmoscope, which will automatically place the macula in full view. Examine for abnormalities in the macula area. The red-free filter facilitates viewing of the center of the macula, or the fovea.</li>
                            <li>TO examine the extreme periphery instruct the patient to:
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>look up for examination of the superior retina</li>
                                    <li>look down for examination of the inferior retina</li>
                                    <li>look temporally for examination of the temporal retina</li>
                                    <li>look nasally for examination of the nasal retina.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>This routine will reveal almost any abnormality that occurs in the fundus.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>To examine the left eye, repeat the procedure outlined above except that you hold the ophthalmoscope in the left hand, stand at the patient's left side and use your left eye. If you don't get a clear view it is usually for one or two reason
                                <ol>
                                    <li>If the patient has a refractive error, try dialing up plus or minus lenses in the ophthalmoscope to bring the fundus into focus.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Especially in myopic patient. It is difficult to see the fundus clearly so use a strong minus lens in the ophthalmoscope.</p>
                                <ol start="2">
                                    <li>If the patient has some opacity in the transparent part of the eye i.e. in the cornea, lens or vitreous, this can be detected with plus lens in the ophthalmoscope when the pupil is dilated.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Seat the baby on his mother's lap, so that her hands restrain his arms and steady his head</li>
                            <li>Wrap the baby in a sheet or blanket, with his head on the examiners lap, and continue what you are going to do</li>
                            <li>In very difficult cases, it may be necessary to apply a drop of local anesthetic, and use a speculum to hold open the eyelids. Use speculum cautiously as it will damage the cornea.</li>
