                        <p>It's a medical sign observed during the swinging flashlight test where the patient's pupil constricts less (therefore appearing to dilate) when a bright light is swung from the unaffected eye to the affected eye.

                        <p>On the affected side, there is ptosis and the pupil is naturally constricted. It will still respond relatively to light but its 'resting' state is constricted. Signs include a persistently small pupil, anisocoria (unequal pupil sizes), and decreased sweating on the affected side of the face.</p>

                            <li><strong>Secondary to ocular diseases</strong> or uveitis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Systematic diseases</strong> e.g. Diabetes mellitus</li>
                            <li><strong>Senile cataract (most common):</strong> degenerative changes</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Gradual painless loss of sight.</li>

                        <p>The main treatment for cataracts is surgery to remove the clouded lens. Common procedures include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Intra Capsular Extraction:</strong> The whole lens is removed, cortex and capsule. Vision is corrected by thick glasses or contact lenses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Extra - Capsular Extraction:</strong> The posterior capsule of the lens is left behind. The anterior capsule is ruptured and the lens is expressed. An intra-ocular lens is then fixed.</li>
                            <li><strong>PhacoEmulsification:</strong> A high frequency ultra-sonic probe emulsifies the nucleus into small fragments which are then sucked out. A foldable intra-ocular lens (IOL) is inserted.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Pre and post-operative management involves patient education, hygiene, infection prevention, and managing intraocular pressure.</p>

                        <p>Around age 40, people begin to experience blurred near vision. This is the result of the natural aging process of the lens where it becomes harder and less elastic, reducing the ability to accommodate for near tasks. Treatment is with a convex lens.</p>

                        <p>It occurs when the eyeball is too long, causing light to be focused at a point in front of the retina rather than directly on its surface. Treatment is with a concave or negative lens.</p>

                        <p>In hypermetropia rays of light are focused behind the retina because the power of the optical system is too low for the length of the eye. Treatment is with a convex or positive lens.</p>

                        <p>Common in older people due to a shallow anterior chamber causing obstruction to the drainage areas by the base of the Iris. May progress to an attack of acute glaucoma with severe eye pain, vomiting, a very red eye, a fixed and dilated pupil, and rapid loss of vision. This is an emergency.</p>
                        <p><strong>MANAGEMENT:</strong> IV mannitol and Diamox to control pressure, followed by surgery (Peripheral Iridectomy).</p>

                        <p>Diabetes causes damage to blood vessels in the retina, which may lead to loss of vision.

                         <p>The chemical likely to cause blindness is alkali e.g. washing soda, lime, ammonia. Alkalis penetrate the cornea and sclera, causing severe uveitis and necrosis.</p>
                         <p><strong>TREATMENT:</strong> Immediate and very thorough irrigation with water. If the injury is severe, give antibiotic, atropine, steroids and refer urgently.</p>

                         <p>Penetrating injury is a significant cause of blindness worldwide. Blindness results from damage to and loss of ocular contents, and infection. Always suspect a penetrating injury if there is a history of injury with a small fast object or sharp object.</p>

                         <p>Blunt trauma is usually caused by a large relatively slow moving object, such as a fist or a stone. It can cause a range of injuries from a periorbital haematoma ("black eye") and sub-conjunctival haemorrhage to more serious conditions like hyphaema (blood in the anterior chamber).</p>
                         <p>Large hyphaemas may bleed again 24-48 hours after the injury, causing severe secondary glaucoma, and need to be managed with strict bed rest and possible surgical removal.</p>
