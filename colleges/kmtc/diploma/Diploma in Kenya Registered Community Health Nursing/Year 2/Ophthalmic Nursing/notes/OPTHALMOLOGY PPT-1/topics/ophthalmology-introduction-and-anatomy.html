                        <ul>
                           <li>It's the white part of the eye</li>
                           <li>The sclera is a dense white tissue made of collagen fibers. It is similar to the tendons and ligaments that hold our skeleton together.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cornea</h3>
                        <p>It's a transparent structure covering the iris. It has five layers from the anterior to posterior:</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Corneal epithelium:</h4>
                        <p>Its an exceedingly thin multicellular epithelial tissue layer of fast-growing and easily regenerated cells, kept moist with tears. The epithelial cells get their oxygen mainly from tears. It is continuous with the conjunctival epithelium, and is composed of about 6 layers of cells which are shed constantly on the exposed layer and are regenerated by multiplication in the basal layer.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Bowman's Layer</h4>
                        <p>(also known as the anterior limiting membrane) it is a tough layer composed of collagen mainly type I collagen that protects the corneal stroma.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Corneal stroma</h4>
                        <p>A thick, transparent middle layer which makes up most of the cornea, and consists of layers of parallel collagen fibres lying at right-angles to each other keratocytes, which are the cells for general repair and maintenance This very regular structure is important for the transparency of the cornea. If the arrangement of fibres is disorganized, there will be a loss of clarity, visible as a cornea scar.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Descemet's membrane</h4>
                        <p>it is a thin acellular layer that serves as the modified basement membrane of the corneal endothelium, from which the cells are derived. This layer is composed mainly of collagen type IV fibrils, less rigid than collagen type I fibrils.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Corneal Endothelium:</h4>
                        <p>This single layer of cells pumps water out of the cornea, keeping it dry and transparent. Unlike the corneal epithelium the cells of the endothelium do not regenerate. Instead, they stretch to compensate for dead cells which reduces the overall cell density of the endothelium, which has an impact on fluid regulation. The endothelial cells cannot be replaced once they have been damaged. They obtain glucose and oxygen from the aqueous humour</p>

                        <p>This layer is also called the uvea, or uveal tract. All three uveal tissues are pigmented and vascular.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Choroid:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The choroid is a thin layer of tissue lying between the retina and sclera.</li>
                            <li>Its pigment helps to absorb light after it has passed through the retina.</li>
                            <li>The high flow of blood through the choroid means that it can supply oxygen to the outer part of the retina.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The ciliary body lies between the edge of the choroid, and the iris.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It contains the ciliary muscle, which alters the focus of the eye by changing the shape of the lens, to which it is attached by the zonules.</li>
                            <li>The surface of the ciliary body consists of tiny folds and processes, the ciliary processes.</li>
                            <li>A single layer of cells on the surface of the ciliary processes, the ciliary epithelium, secretes aqueous humour.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Iris:</h4>
                        <p>The iris is a ring of pigmented tissue that controls the amount of light entering the eye.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The hole in the centre of the iris is the pupil and all light entering the eye must pass through this opening.</li>
                            <li>The iris, by contracting the circular sphincter muscle at the pupil margin, makes the pupil smaller.</li>
                            <li>Contraction of the radial dilator muscle fibres enlarges the pupil.</li>
                            <li>The pupil constricts in bright light, and when looking at near objects.</li>

                            <li>The photo-receptors contains a chemical called retinol, which changes when it is exposed to light, Retinol is Vitamin A.</li>
                            <li>At the centre of the retina is an area called the macula.</li>
                            <li>This part of the retina does not contain any rods, or the nerve fibre layer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cones</strong>
                                <ul>

                        </ul>
                        <p>It is responsible for the detailed central vision used for reading. The photoreceptor layer receives oxygen from the choroid.</p>

                        <p>When light hits a photoreceptor cell, the cell transmits an electrical signal, which is carried down the nerve fibres until it reaches the brain. The nerve fibres all meet at the optic disc, where they join together to form the optic nerve. The nerve fibre receives its blood supply from blood vessels which enter the eye through the optic disc.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Lens</h3>
                        <p>The lens is composed of a central nucleus, surrounded by the cortex. It is enclosed in a thin membrane, the capsule. The lens is attached to the ciliary body, just behind the iris, by the fine fibres of the zonule. As the ciliary muscle contracts, the zonular fibres relax, allowing the lens to become fatter, and changing the focal point of the eye.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Aqueous</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Aqueous means watery, and the aqueous humour is composed of water and a little salt. It is produced by the ciliary body.</li>
                            <li>From the ciliary body it circulates around the lens, through the pupil, and into the anterior chamber.</li>
                            <li>It slowly passes out of the eye through the trabecular meshwork.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This is a fine network of fibrous tissue that lies in a ring around the anterior chamber between the cornea and the iris. Aqueous soaks through it gradually, because the continuous production of aqueous by the ciliary body causes the pressure of fluid inside the eye to rise until the aqueous is forced out through the trabecular meshwork. Once through the trabecular meshwork, the aqueous enters the canal of schlemm, which simply collects aqueous as it leaves the anterior chamber.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>From the canal of schlemm, the aqueous drains freely into veins lying under conjunctiva.</li>
                            <li>The circulation of aqueous is very important. It provides oxygen for the lens and the corneal endothelium.</li>
                            <li>The pressure produced by the continual production of aqueous and the resistance to outflow of the trabecular meshwork is the Intra-Ocular Pressure, or IOP. The normal IOP is 10-21 mmHg.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Eyelids</h3>
                        <p>The globe is protected by two folds of skin and mucous membrane, the eyelids. The medial and lateral angles of the lids are called the medial and lateral canthus. The lids are divided into two parts:-</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1. Anterior Lamella</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Skin:</strong> The skin is thin and almost without hairs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Orbicularis:</strong> This muscle runs around the eyelids in a circle. Contraction of the orbicularis muscle closes the eye. It is supplied by the Facial or 7th nerve.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lashes:</strong> These special hairs grow on the lateral 5/6 of the lids. They help to protect the eye.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2. Posterior Lamella</h4>
                        <ul>
                           <li><strong>Conjunctiva:</strong> The conjunctiva is a thin mucous membrane that starts at the lid margin, covers the back of the lid, and the surface of the sclera. It stops at the limbus.</li>
                           <li>It contains mucous glands which are essential for the tear film.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Tarsal Plate:</h4>
                        <ul>
                           <li>The tarsal plate is the skeleton of the lids.</li>
                           <li>It is made of fibro-cartilage. The conjunctiva is firmly stuck to its inner surface, so it moves easily over the eye.</li>
                           <li>The tarsal plates contain meibomian glands which produce an oily secretion that slows the evaporation of the tears. The upper tarsal plate is supported by the levator muscle. Contraction of this muscle opens the eye, and is controlled by the oculomotor, or 3rd nerve.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Orbit</h3>
                        <p>The Orbit is the bony cavity that contains the eyeball, and its associated structures. The orbit is shaped like a pyramid, with four triangular sides.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Medial Wall:</strong> Ethmoid bone</li>
                            <li><strong>Lateral Wall:</strong> Zygomatic bone</li>
                            <li><strong>Floor:</strong> Maxillary bone</li>
                            <li><strong>Roof:</strong> Frontal bone</li>
                            <li><strong>Apex:</strong> Sphenoid bone.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All these bones, except the zygoma, contain large empty spaces, lined with mucous membrane, and opening into the nose. These are called para-nasal sinuses.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Orbital Contents</h4>
                        <h5>1. Muscles</h5>
                        <p>There are seven muscles in the orbit.</p>
                        <h6>a) Rectus Muscles</h6>
                        <p>All the rectus arise from the apex of the orbit, and are attached to the eye about 5-6 mm in front of the equator.</p>
                        <h6>b) Oblique Muscles</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Superior oblique</strong> - this muscle arises from the apex with the other muscles, but then passes through a "pulley" or trochlea on the medial wall of the orbit. The tendon then runs backwards from the trochlea to attach to the eye under the superior rectus. Supplied by the Trochlear, 4th nerve.</li>
                            <li><strong>Inferior oblique</strong> - this muscle arises from the medial floor of the orbit, and passes under and behind the eye. Supplied by 3rd nerve.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Both the oblique muscles are attached to the eye behind the equator. The superior oblique makes the eye look down, and the inferior oblique makes the eye look up.</p>
                        <h6>c) Levator Muscle</h6>
                        <p>The levator arises from the apex of the orbit, and is attached to the upper tarsal plate. It is supplied by the oculomotor, 3rd nerve, and it opens the eye by raising the upper lid.</p>

                        <h5>2) Nerves</h5>
                        <p>The orbit contains the following nerves:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>2nd - Optic nerve</strong> - carries visual information from the retina to the brain. Covered in meninges, and surrounded by CSF.</li>
                            <li><strong>3rd - Oculomotor nerve</strong> - controls extra-ocular muscles, pupil sphincter, and ciliary muscle.</li>
                            <li><strong>4th - Trochlear nerve</strong> - controls superior oblique muscle.</li>
                            <li><strong>5th - Ophthalmic nerve</strong> - this is one branch of the trigeminal nerve. It supplies touch and pain sensation to the eye and upper lid.</li>
                            <li><strong>6th - Abducens nerve</strong> - controls the lateral rectus muscle</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>3) Lacrimal Gland & Ducts</h5>
                        <p>The lacrimal gland produces tears, which protect and lubricate the eye. It lies in the upper lateral quarter of the orbit. The gland is divided into two parts by the levator muscle. Half of the gland lies above the levator, next to the roof of the orbit, and half lies below the levator, next to the conjunctiva.</p>
                        <p>The gland secretes tears through 10-20 tear ducts that enter the conjunctival sac through the upper fornix.</p>
                        <p>After the tears have spread across the eye, they drain away through the puncta.</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>These are two little holes in the upper and lower lid, about 5 mm from the media canthus. From the puncta, two very narrow ducts, the canaliculi, carry the tears to the naso-lacrimal sac.</li>
                           <li>The naso lacrimal sac empties into the nasolacrimal duct, which lies in the lateral wall of the nose. The tears finally drain into the nose through an opening in the side of the nasal cavity.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The remaining space within the orbit is filed with fat. This forms a cushion on which the eye rests.</p>

                        <p>The optic nerve leaves the orbit through the optic foramen. The optic nerves then meet at the optic chiasm, which lies just above the pituitary gland. At the chiasm, the optic nerve fibres from the nasal retina cross over to the opposite side of the brain, while those from the temporal retina stay on the same side.</p>
                        <p>After the chiasm, the nerve fibres form the optic tract. This is composed of nerve fibres from both eyes. Most of the nerve fibres in the optic tract go to the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus, but a small number go to the 3rd nerve nucleus. From the thalamus, the nerve fibres go to the visual cortex, at the back of the brain, in the occipital lobe. The 3rd nerve controls the pupil light reflex, which means that when a bright light shines into one eye, the sphincter muscles of both eyes contract, making the pupils smaller.</p>
