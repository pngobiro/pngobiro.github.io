                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Visual acuity (V.A) is a measure of the patient's ability to see detail at a specified distance. It is the first and most important part of any examination of an eye patient.</p>
                        <p>It is usually tested with a VA chart.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Letters (Snellen)</strong> - Patient must be literate.</li>
                            <li><strong>E chart</strong> - 25% chance of guessing correctly.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>VA is usually quoted as two numbers, one above the other, e.g. 6/6, 6/18, 6/5.</p>
                        <p>VA measurement is based on a theoretical normal person. The bottom number of the VA is the distance at which a normal person should be able to see the letters. The top number indicates the distance at which the patient can read these letters.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>6/6</strong> means that the line of letters which can be seen by the patient at 6 metres corresponds to the size of letter that can be seen by a theoretically normal person at 6 metres. A vision of 6/6 is normal vision.</li>
                            <li><strong>6/18</strong> means that the line of letters which can be seen by the patient at 6 metres corresponds to the size of letter that can be seen by a theoretically normal person at 18 metres. A vision of 6/18 is a little worse than normal.</li>
                            <li><strong>6/5</strong> means that the line of letters which can be seen by the patient at 6 metres corresponds to the size of letter that can be seen by a theoretically normal person at 5 metres. A vision of 6/5 is a little better than normal.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Testing Procedure and Low Vision Assessment</h3>
                        <p>The VA is tested by covering one eye, and testing the other eye, so that the vision is measured in each eye individually. The patient should stand 6 metres from the chart, which should be well illuminated, and on a dark background.</p>
                        <p>If the patient cannot see the top letter on the chart, VA is tested by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bringing the patient closer to the chart.</li>
                            <li><strong>Finger counting</strong> at different distances e.g. CF 5m, CF 2m.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hand Motions</strong> e.g. HM. Examiners hand is passed slowly in front of the patient's eyes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Perception of light</strong> e.g. PL</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the eye has No perception of light it is recorded as NPL. Measuring the VA does not begin and end with the E-chart, you can begin to assess the VA as soon as you see the patient. Can he walk unaided, or is he led? Does he know where to sit? Can he tell staff from patients?</p>
                        <p>A VA of less than 3/60 means that the patient is blind by the WHO definition of blindness. However, different people require different standards of vision. A farmer can grow food successfully with a VA of 6/60, but an eye doctor needs 6/6. Most everyday tasks are easily accomplished with a VA of 6/18.</p>
                        <p>A reduced VA may be the result of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Blindness</li>
                            <li>Malingering</li>
                            <li>Failure to comprehend, or to co-operate in, the test.</li>
                            <li>Uncorrected refractive error.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When the vision is less than 6/18, it should be checked with a pinhole, if no cause for the reduced VA can be found. A pinhole compensates for uncorrected refractive errors. A normal VA does not exclude serious eye disease. The VA tests only the macular vision, and not the remainder of the retina, and or the peripheral visual field.</p>

                            <li>Set the side rails to give the patient a sense of security and to avoid falling.</li>
                            <li>Encourage the patient to seek for help instead of moving.</li>

                            <li>The light should be dim as bright light aggreviates pain and delays healing.</li>

                            <li>It is a major worldwide public health problem.</li>
                            <li>There are about 30,000,000 blind people in the world, of whom 28,000,000 live in third world countries.</li>
                            <li>In Kenya, about 1% of the population is blind, approx. 220,000 people.</li>
                            <li>In parts of Africa, particularly the richer and more urbanized areas, the prevalence if blindness is less.</li>
                            <li>In most other regions, especially where trachoma or onchocerciasis are common, the prevalence of blindness is higher e.g. nearly 5% higher in southern Sudan.</li>
                            <li>N/B: The number of blind people increases as the population increases.</li>

                        <p>Blind people can be divided into three groups:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Economic blindness</strong><br>one is unable to see enough to perform normal work. The VA will depend on the work being done. This affects the community at large.</li>
                            <li><strong>Navigational blindness</strong><br>Unable to walk unaided in unfamiliar surroundings. Usually a VA OF 3/60. This is the WHO definition of blindness.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social blindness</strong><br>Unable to dress, feed or look after himself. They totally depend on friends and other family members. VA usually HM or worse.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Causes of Blindness</h3>
