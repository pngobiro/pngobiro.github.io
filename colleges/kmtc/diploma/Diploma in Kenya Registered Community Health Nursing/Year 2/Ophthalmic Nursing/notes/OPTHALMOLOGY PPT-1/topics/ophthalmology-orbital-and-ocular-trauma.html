                        <p>The orbit is the bony socket containing the eye and its surrounding structures, such as the lacrimal gland and extraocular muscles. Diseases in the orbit often cause displacement of the eyeball. If the eye is pushed forward, it is called proptosis, which is the most common symptom of orbital disease.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Exposure keratopathy</strong> - the eyeball is so proptosed that the lid cannot close over it.
                                <p><strong>TREATMENT:</strong> Tarsorrhaphy, and refer for orbital surgery.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Optic nerve compression</strong> - Pressure on the nerve within the orbit leads to optic atrophy.
                                <p><strong>TREATMENT:</strong> High dose systemic steroids, and refer urgently for orbital surgery.</p>
                            </li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Examination of Orbital Diseases</h3>
                        <p>Note the following;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Displacement of the globe</strong> - note how far the globe has been displaced, and in what direction. Has it been pushed up, down or sideways, or just forward.</li>
                            <li><strong>Orbital mass</strong> - Feel around the orbital margin to look for a palpable mass. Check the pre-auricular lymph nodes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Eye movement</strong>- look for any restriction in eye movement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Exposure</strong> - check whether the patient can close the eye.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pupil reaction</strong> - look for an afferent pupil defect.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Orbital Cellulitis</h3>
                        <p>Its usually caused by pneumococci, streptococci or staphylococci. The infection can enter the orbit through the thin walls of the surrounding sinuses. From the orbit it can spread to the brain via the venous drainage of the orbit, or directly via the optic nerve and this can be fatal.</p>
                        <p><strong>CLINICAL FEATURES</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acute pain, Swelling and fever.</li>
                            <li>Proptosis and very inflamed eye.</li>
                            <li>Restricted eye movement.</li>
                            <li>The pupil may be fixed and dilated.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Admit for and give high dose of intravenous antibiotics.</li>
                            <li>Intra-orbital abscesses may need to be drained surgically.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Delay can be fatal.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mucocele</h3>
                        <p>This is accumulation of mucus within the sinus due to obstruction of the sinus opening and it gradually enlarges into the orbit. The commonly affected sinuses are frontal and ethmoid.</p>
                        <p><strong>CLINICAL FEATURES</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Slow progressive Proptosis over a period of time.</li>
                            <li>The globe is displaced inferiorly and laterally.</li>
                            <li>A smooth mass can often be felt near the orbital margin.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
                        <p>Refer for surgery. The mucocele is opened and drained and a drainage inserted through the nose left insitu. This drainage is left insitu for 6 months to prevent the mucocele from recurring.</p>

                        <p>Injury to the orbit is usually associated with a head injury; hence, the patient's general medical condition must first be stabilized before conducting an ocular examination.</p>
                        <p>To establish the extent of ocular injury, visual acuity is assessed as soon as possible, even if it is only a rough estimate. Soft tissue orbital injuries often result in damage to the optic nerve. Major ocular injuries indicated by a soft globe, prolapsing tissue, ruptured globe, hemorrhage, and loss of red reflex require immediate surgical attention.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Closed injuries lead to contusions with subconjunctival hemorrhage, commonly known as a black eye. Blood accumulates in the tissues of the conjunctiva. Hemorrhage may be caused by a soft tissue injury to the eyelid or by an underlying fracture.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>

                           <li>Cold compresses are used in the early phase followed by warm compresses.</li>
                           <li>Hematomas that appear as swollen, fluctuating areas may be surgically drained or aspirated; if they are causing significant orbital pressure, they may be surgically evacuated.</li>
                           <li>Penetrating injuries or severe blow to the head can result in severe optic nerve damage. Visual loss can be sudden or delayed and progressive.</li>
                           <li>Immediate loss of vision after an ocular injury is usually irreversible. Delayed visual loss has a better prognosis.</li>
                           <li>Corticosteroid therapy is indicated to reduce optic nerve swelling.</li>
                           <li>Surgery, such as optic nerve decompression, may be performed.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Orbital Fractures</h3>
                        <p>Orbital fractures are detected by facial x-rays. Depending on the orbital structures involved, orbital fractures can be classified as blowout, zygomatic or tripod, maxillary, midfacial, orbital apex and orbital roof fractures. Blow-out fractures result from compression of soft tissue and sudden increase in orbital pressure when the force is transmitted to the orbital floor, the area of least resistance.</p>
                        <p>The inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles, with their fat and fascial attachments, or the nerve that courses along the inferior oblique muscle may become entrapped, and the globe may be displaced inward (ie, enophthalmos).</p>
                        <p>Computed tomography (CT) can firmly identify the muscle and its auxiliary structures that are entrapped. These fractures are usually caused by blunt small objects, such as a fist, knee, elbow, or tennis or golf balls.</p>
                        <p>Orbital roof fractures are dangerous because of potential complications to the brain. Surgical management of these fractures requires a neurosurgeon and an ophthalmologist.</p>
                        <p>The most common indications for surgical intervention are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Displacement of bone fragments disfiguring the normal facial contours</li>
                            <li>Interference with normal binocular vision caused by extraocular muscle entrapment</li>
                            <li>Interference with mastication in zygomatic fracture</li>
                            <li>Obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Surgery is usually nonemergent, and a period of 10 to 14 days gives the ophthalmologist time to assess ocular function, especially the extraocular muscles and the nasolacrimal duct.</p>
                        <p>Emergency surgical repair is usually not performed unless the globe is displaced to the maxillary sinus. The goals are freeing the entrapped ocular structures, restoring the integrity of the orbital floor, and cosmetic surgery for deformities of the globe. Enophthalmos may follow after 4 to 6 months, but successful repair is usually difficult.</p>

                         <p>Ocular trauma is the leading cause of blindness among children and young adults, especially male trauma victims. The most common circumstances of ocular trauma are occupational injuries (eg, construction industry), sports (eg, baseball, basketball, racket sports, boxing), weapons (eg, air guns, BB guns), assault, motor vehicle crashes (eg, broken windshields), and war (eg, blast fragments).</p>
                         <p>For the non ophthalmic practitioner, initial intervention is performed in only two conditions: chemical burns, for which irrigation of the eye with normal saline solution or even plain tap water must occur immediately, and a foreign body, for which bodies are usually removed if they are superficial and anterior in location.</p>
 
                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h3>
                         <p>A thorough history is obtained, particularly assessing the patient's ocular history, such as preinjury vision in the affected eye or past ocular surgery. Details related to the injury that helps in the diagnosis and assessment of need for further tests include the nature of the ocular injury (ie, blunt or penetrating trauma), the type of activity causing the injury to determine the nature of the force striking the eye and whether onset of vision loss was sudden, slow or progressive.</p>
                         <p>For chemical eye burns, the chemical agent must be identified and tested for pH if a sample is available. The corneal surface is examined for foreign bodies, wounds, and abrasions, after which the other external structures of the eye are examined.</p>
                         <p>Pupillary size, shape, and light reaction of the pupil of the affected eye are compared with the other eye. Ocular motility, which is the ability of the eyes to move synchronously up, down, right, and left, is also assessed.</p>
                         <p>Splash injuries are irrigated with normal saline solution before further evaluation. In cases of ruptured globe, cycloplegic agents (ie, agents that paralyze the ciliary muscle) or topical antibiotics must be deferred because of potential toxicity to exposed intraocular tissues. Further manipulation of the eye must be avoided until the patient is under general anesthesia.</p>
                         <p>Parenteral, broad spectrum antibiotics are initiated. Tetanus antitoxin is administered, if indicated, as well as analgesics. (Tetanus prophylaxis is recommended for full-thickness ocular and skin wounds.) Any topical medication (eg, anesthetic, dyes) must be sterile.</p>
 
                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Penetrating Injuries and Contusions of the Eyeball</h3>
                         <p>Sharp penetrating injury or blunt contusion force can rupture the eyeball. When the eye wall, cornea and sclera rupture, rapid decompression or herniation of the orbital contents into adjacent sinuses can occur. In general, blunt traumatic injuries (with an increased incidence of retinal detachment, intraocular tissue avulsion, and herniation) have a worse prognosis than penetrating injuries.</p>
                         <p>Most penetrating injuries result in marked loss of vision with the following signs: hemorrhagic chemosis (ie, edema of the conjunctiva), conjunctival laceration, shallow anterior chamber with or without an eccentrically placed pupil, hyphema (ie, hemorrhage within the chamber), or vitreous hemorrhage.</p>
                         <p>Hyphema is caused by contusion forces that tear the vessels of the iris and damage the anterior chamber angle. Preventing rebleeding and prolonged increased IOP are the goals of treatment for hyphema.</p>
                         <p>An eye shield is applied. Topical corticosteroids are prescribed to reduce inflammation. An antifibrinolytic agent, aminocaproic acid (Amicar), stabilizes clot formation at the site of hemorrhage. Aspirin is contraindicated.</p>
                         <p>A ruptured globe and severe injuries with intraocular hemorrhage require surgical intervention. Vitrectomy is performed for traumatic retinal detachments. Primary enucleation (ie, complete removal of the eyeball and part of the optic nerve) is considered only if the globe is irreparable and has no light perception.</p>
                         <p>It is a general rule that enucleation is performed within 2 weeks of the initial injury (in an eye that has no useful vision after sustaining penetrating injury) to prevent the risk of sympathetic ophthalmia, an inflammation created in the fellow eye by the affected eye that can result in blindness of the fellow eye.</p>

                             <p>It is of utmost importance that topical anesthetic eye drops are not given to a patient for repeated use after corneal injury because their effects mask further damage, delay healing, and can lead to permanent corneal scarring.

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Intraocular Foreign Bodies</h3>
                         <p>A patient who complains of blurred vision and discomfort should be questioned carefully about recent injuries and exposures. Patients may be injured in a number of different situations and suffer an intraocular foreign body (IOFB). Precipitating circumstances can include working in construction, striking metal against metal, being involved in motor vehicle crashes with facial injury, gunshot wounds, and grinding-wheel work.</p>
                         <p>IOFB is diagnosed and localized by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy, as well as CT or ultrasonography.</p>
                         <p>MRI is contraindicated because most foreign bodies are metallic and magnetic. It is important to determine the composition, size, and location of the IOFB and affected eye structures. Every effort should be made to identify the type of IOFB and whether it is magnetic.</p>
                         <p>Iron, steel, copper, and vegetable matter cause intense inflammatory reactions. The incidence of endophthalmitis is also high. If the cornea is perforated, tetanus prophylaxis and intravenous antibiotics are administered. The extraction route (ie, surgical incision) of the foreign body depends on its location and composition and associated ocular injuries. Specially designed IOFB forceps and magnets are used to grasp and remove the foreign body. Any damaged area of the retina is treated to prevent retinal detachment.</p>
                         <p>Orbital foreign bodies that enter the orbit are usually tolerated, except for copper, iron and vegetable materials such as those from plants or trees, which may cause purulent infection. X-rays and CT scans are used to identify the foreign body. After the extent of the orbital damage is assessed, the decision is made between conservative treatment and surgical removal. Orbital foreign bodies are usually removed if they are superficial and anterior in location, have sharp edges that may affect adjacent orbital structures, or are composed of copper, iron, or vegetable material.</p>
                         <p>The surgical intervention is directed at prevention of further ocular injury and maintaining the integrity of the affected areas. Cultures are usually obtained, and the patient is placed on prophylactic intravenous antibiotics that are later changed to oral antibiotics.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Chemical Burns</h3>
                         <p>Alkali, acid and other chemically active organic substances, such as mace and tear gas, cause chemical burns. Alkali burns (eg, lye, ammonia) result in the most injury because they penetrate the ocular tissues rapidly and continue to cause damage long after the initial injury is sustained. They also cause an immediate rise in IOP.</p>
                         <p>Acids (eg, bleach, car batteries, refrigerant) generally cause less damage because the precipitated necrotic tissue proteins form a barrier to further penetration and damage. Chemical burns may appear as superficial punctate keratopathy (ie, spotty damage to the cornea), subconjunctival hemorrhage, or complete marbleizing of the cornea.</p>
                         <p>In treating chemical burns, every minute counts. Immediate tap-water irrigation should be started on site before transport of the patient to an emergency department. Only a brief history and examination are performed. The corneal surfaces and conjunctival fornices are immediately and copiously irrigated with normal saline or any neutral solution. A local anesthetic is instilled, and a lid speculum is applied to overcome blepharospasm (ie, spasms of the eyelid muscles that result in closure of the lids).</p>
                         <p>Particulate matter must be removed from the fornices using moistened, cottontip applicators and minimal pressure on the globe. Irrigation continues until the conjunctival pH normalizes (between 7.3 and 7.6). The pH of the corneal surface is checked by placing a pH paper strip in the fornix. Antibiotics are instilled, and the eye is patched.</p>
                         <p>The goal of intermediate treatment is to prevent tissue ulceration and promote re-epithelialization. Intense lubrication using nonpreserved (ie, without preservatives to avoid allergic reactions) tears is essential. Reepithelialization is promoted with patching or therapeutic soft lenses. The patient is usually monitored daily for several days. Prognosis depends on the type of injury and adequacy of the irrigation immediately after exposure.</p>
                         <p>Long-term treatment consists of two phases: restoration of the ocular surface through grafting procedures and surgical restoration of corneal integrity and optical clarity.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Thermal and Photochemical Injury</h3>
                         <p>Thermal injury is caused by exposure to a hot object (eg, curling iron, tobacco, ash), whereas photochemical injury results from ultraviolet irradiation or infrared exposure (eg, exposure to the reflections from snow, sun gazing, viewing an eclipse of the sun without an adequate filter).</p>
                         <p>These injuries can cause corneal epithelial defect, corneal opacity, conjunctival chemosis and injection (ie, congestion of blood vessels), and burns of the eyelids and periocular region. Antibiotics and a pressure patch for 24 hours constitute the treatment of mild injuries. Scarring of the eyelids may require oculoplastic surgery, whereas corneal scarring may require corneal surgery.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                         <p>Dry eye syndrome, or keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is a deficiency in the production of any of the aqueous, mucin, or lipid tear film components; lid surface abnormalities; or epithelial abnormalities related to systemic diseases (eg, thyroid disorders, Parkinson's disease), infection, injury, or complications of medications (eg, antihistamines, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines).</p>
                         
                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                         <p>The most common complaint in dry eye syndrome is a scratchy or foreign body sensation. Other symptoms include itching, excessive mucus secretion, inability to produce tears, a burning sensation, redness, pain, and difficulty moving the lids.</p>
 
                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Assessment and Diagnostic Findings</h3>
                         <p>Slit-lamp examination shows an absent or interrupted tear meniscus at the lower lid margin, and the conjunctiva is thickened, edematous, hyperemic, and has lost its luster. A tear meniscus is the crescent-shaped edge of the tear film in the lower lid margin. Chronic dry eyes may result in chronic conjunctival and corneal irritation that can lead to corneal erosion, scarring, ulceration, thinning, or perforation that can seriously threaten vision. Secondary bacterial infection can occur.</p>
 
                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                         <p>Management of dry eye syndrome requires the complete cooperation of the patient with a regimen that needs to be followed at home for a long period, or complete relief of symptoms is unlikely.</p>
                         <ul>
                            <li>Instillation of artificial tears during the day</li>
                            <li>An ointment at night is the usual regimen to hydrate and lubricate the eye through stimulating tears and preserving a moist ocular surface.</li>
                            <li>Anti-inflammatory medications are also used e.g dexamethasone</li>
                            <li>and moisture chambers (eg, moisture chamber spectacles, swim goggles) may provide additional relief.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <p>Management of the dry eye syndrome also includes the concurrent treatment of infections, such as chronic blepharitis and acne rosacea, and treating the underlying systemic disease, such as Sjogren's syndrome (an autoimmune disease).</p>
                         <p>In advanced cases of dry eye syndrome, surgical treatment that includes punctal occlusion, grafting procedures, and lateral tarsorrhaphy (ie, uniting the edges of the lids) are options. Punctal plugs are made of silicone material for the temporary or permanent occlusion of the puncta. This helps preserve the natural tears and prolongs the effects of artificial tears. Short-term occlusion is performed by inserting punctal or silicone rods in all four puncta.</p>
                         <p>If tearing is induced, the upper plugs are removed, and the remaining lower plugs are removed in another week. Permanent occlusion is performed only in severe cases among adults who do not develop tearing after partial occlusion and who have results on a repeated Schirmer's test of 2 mm or less (filter paper is used to measure tear production).</p>
                         
                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">COMPLICATIONS</h3>
