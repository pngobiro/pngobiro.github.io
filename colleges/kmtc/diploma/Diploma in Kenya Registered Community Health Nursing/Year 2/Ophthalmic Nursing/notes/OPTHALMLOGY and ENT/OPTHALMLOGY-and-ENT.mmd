\section*{OPTHALMOLOOGY AND ENT CONDITIONS.}

BY MRS MUOKI.

\section*{VISION}

\section*{VISUAL ACUITY TEST}
- Using Snell chart.
- It ha denomerator and neumerator.
- The distance between the patient and the object should be 6 cm or 20 feet.
- Neumerator refers to the distance between the person and the chart.
- Denomerator represent the smallest letter which the patient can read.

\section*{Cont.....................}
- Using hand movement.
- You move your hand up and down and if the patient ca notice you report the patient can notice.
${ }^{-}$If the patient can not the arm movement you report the patient cannot see eye movement.
- Using light perception.
- If the patient cant see then there no perception of light.
- If the patient can see light then there is perception of light.
*Remember you test and report both eyes separately.

\section*{REFRACTION ERRORS}
- Occurs due to short or elongated eyeballs preventing light from focusing on the retina.
- Refraction errors are short sightedness(myopia) and long sighted (hyperopia).
- treatment is use of contact lens, eye glasses and surgery.

\section*{CONDITIONS OF THE EYE}

\section*{EYE LID AND TEAR GLAND DISODERS.}
- The eye lid plays a key role in protecting the eye, helps in spread of moisture on the surface of the eye during blinking and mechanical damage against injury.

${ }^{-}$Inflammation of the uvea.
- Uvea consist of Irish, cilliary muscle and choroid. The irish is colored ring around the black pupil and often closes like the commercial lens.
- Cilliary body is set of muscles that make lens thicker so as to focus closer object and thins so as to focus fur objects.
- Choroid is the inner lining of the eye extending from the edge of the cilliary muscle to the back of the eye.

\section*{Cont..................}
- Cause
- Infection like (TB and syphilis) and allergy.

\section*{Cont...........}
- Treatment
- Supplements of vitamin A lutein and oily fish high in the omega fatty acids.
- Sunglasses to protect from UV light.
- Antiviral medication for virus caused retinitis.

\section*{RETINAL DETACHMENT}
- Occurs when the thin lining at the back of the eye called retina detaches begin to pull away from the blood vessel that supply them with blood thus leading death of the affected eye.
- Causes
- Retina becoming thinner and more brittle with age and puling away from underlying blood vessels.
- It can also be caused by direct damage.
