                        <p>Light can be defined as that part of the electromagnetic spectrum to which the retina is sensitive. The visible part of the spectrum lies between the wavebands 390 nm and 760 nm. For the eye to generate accurate visual information light must be correctly focused on the retina. The focus must be adjustable to allow equally clear vision of near and distant objects. The cornea, or actually the air/ tear interface, is responsible for two-thirds of the focusing power of the eye, and the crystalline lens for one-third. These two refracting elements in the eye converge the rays of light because:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The refracting surfaces of the cornea and lens are spherically convex.</li>
                            <li>The cornea has a higher refractive index than air; the lens has a higher refractive index than the aqueous and vitreous humours that surround it. The velocity of light is reduced in a dense medium so that light is refracted towards the normal. When passing from the air to the cornea, or from the aqueous to the lens, the rays therefore converge.</li>

                        <p>When parallel rays of light from a distant object are brought to a focus on the retina with the eye at rest (i.e. not accommodating) the refractive state of the eye is known as emmetropia (Figure 3.1). Such an individual can see sharply in the distance without accommodation.</p>
                        <p>In ametropia, parallel rays of light are not brought to a focus on the retina with the eye at rest. A change in refraction is required to achieve sharp vision. Ametropia may be divided into:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Myopia (short-sightedness):</strong> the optical power of the eye is too high (usually due to an elongated globe) and parallel rays of light are brought to a focus in front of the retina (Figure 3.2).</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hypermetropia (long-sightedness):</strong> the optical power is too low (usually because the eye is too short) and parallel rays of light converge towards a point behind the retina (Figure 3.2).</li>
                            <li><strong>Astigmatism:</strong> the optical power of the cornea in different planes is not equal. Parallel rays of light passing through these different planes are brought to different points of focus.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All three types of ametropia can be corrected by spectacle lenses (Figure 3.3). These diverge the rays in myopia, converge the rays in hypermetropia, and correct for the non-spherical shape of the cornea in astigmatism. It should be noted that in hypermetropia, accommodative effort will bring distant objects into focus by increasing the power of the lens. This will use up the accommodative reserve for near objects.</p>

                        <p>As an object of regard is brought nearer to the eye, focus is maintained by an increase in the power of the lens of the eye. This is brought about by ciliary muscle contraction, which relaxes zonular tension on the lens equator and allows the lens to take up a more spherical shape. This is accommodation (Figure 3.4). The eyes also converge.</p>
                        <p>The ability to accommodate decreases with age, reaching a critical point at about 40-plus years, when the subject experiences difficulty with near vision (presbyopia). This occurs earlier in hypermetropes than in myopes. The problem is overcome with convex reading lenses, which provide the converging power no longer supplied by the lens of the eye.</p>

                        <p>The lens provides one-third of the refractive power of the eye, so that after cataract extraction (the removal of an opaque lens) the eye is rendered highly hypermetropic, a condition termed aphakia. This can be corrected by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the insertion of an intraocular lens at the time of surgery;</li>
                            <li>contact lenses;</li>
                            <li>aphakic spectacles.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Intraocular lenses (IOLs) give the best optical results and are routinely used in the developed world and increasingly used in the developing world. These are placed at the site of the natural lens and mimic its performance. As they are unable to change shape the eye cannot accommodate. An eye with an IOL is said to be pseudophakic.</p>
                        <p>Hinged lenses are available, which can achieve a degree of accommodative effect and also multifocal IOLs, which combine a distance and near correction. Multifocal lenses may not suit everybody because of optical side effects (reduced contrast and glare), so it is important to counsel patients preoperatively. Multifocal lenses may allow patients to be independent of spectacles for both distance and near vision.</p>
                        <p>Contact lenses are worn at the surface of the cornea and produce slight magnification of the retinal image (110%); this is not of visual significance. Insertion, removal and cleaning can be difficult for elderly patients or those with physical disability (e.g. arthritis).</p>
                        <p>Aphakic spectacles are corrective spectacles which are provided when no IOL has been used. They have a number of disadvantages:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They are powerful positive lenses which magnify the retinal image by about 133%, causing the patient to misjudge distances. They cannot be used to correct one eye alone if the other eye is phakic (the natural lens is in situ) or pseudophakic, because of the disparity in image size between the two corrected eyes (aniseikonia). This causes symptoms of dizziness and diplopia.</li>
                            <li>Aphakic lenses induce many optical aberrations, including distortion of the image due to the thickness of the lens.</li>

                        <p>Although refractive errors are most commonly corrected by spectacles or contact lenses, laser surgical correction is gaining popularity. The excimer laser is used to precisely ablate a superficial layer of stromal tissue from the cornea to modify its shape and alter its refractive function. Myopia is corrected by flattening the cornea and hypermetropia by steepening it. In photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), the laser is applied to the corneal surface after removing the epithelium. The cornea is resurfaced in a few days. In laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), the epithelium is intact. A hinged, partial-thickness flap of corneal stroma is first created with a rapidly moving automated blade. The flap is lifted and the laser applied to the stromal bed to alter its contour. The flap is then restored to its original position. Unlike PRK, LASIK provides a near instantaneous improvement in vision with minimal discomfort. Laserassisted subepithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) creates only an epithelial flap, leaving a thicker stroma. This may be important in those with a thin cornea. The LASEK flap takes longer to heal than a LASIK flap. Serious complications during flap creation occur rarely.</p>
                        <p>Patients experience discomfort for a few days after PRK although the level of pain can be reduced by provision of a bandage contact lens and treatment with topical or systemic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Intraocular lenses can also be placed in a phakic eye to correct severe refractive error, but this carries all the risks of intraocular surgery and the possibility of cataract formation.</p>

                                    <li>The visible spectrum extends from 390 to 760 nm.</li>
                                    <li>Emmetropia means that parallel rays of light are brought to a focus on the retina when accommodation is relaxed.</li>
                                    <li>In myopia the rays are focused in front of the retina, in hypermetropia they are focused behind the retina.</li>
                                    <li>Astigmatism suggests that the cornea is perfectly round.</li>
                                    <li>Presbyopia refers to the loss of accommodation with age.</li>

                                    <li>A concave lens causes divergence of parallel rays and is used to correct myopia.</li>
                                    <li>A convex lens causes convergence of parallel rays and is used to correct hypermetropia.</li>
                                    <li>The natural lens provides 50% of the refractive power of the eye.</li>
                                    <li>Aphakic spectacles magnify the retinal image.</li>
                                    <li>The power of the crystalline lens decreases with accommodation.</li>

                                    <li>False. It suggests that the shape of the cornea is similar to a rugby ball.</li>
                                    <li>True. The lens is unable to change shape sufficiently and the ability to accommodate is reduced.</li>
