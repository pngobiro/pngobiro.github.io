    <h3 id="swollen-optic-disc-heading" class="subsection-heading">The swollen optic disc</h3>
    <p>The swollen disc (Figure 14.2) is an important and often worrying sign. Papilloedema is the term given to disc swelling associated with raised intracranial pressure (ICP), accelerated hypertension and optic disc ischaemia. Papillitis, a condition with a similar fundoscopic appearance, is due to optic neuritis (inflammation) affecting the nerve head. Visual loss always occurs with optic neuritis but is uncommon with the papilloedema of hypertension and/or raised intracranial pressure; it is, however, a feature of ischaemic papilloedema.</p>
    <p>The differential diagnosis of disc swelling is shown in Table 14.1. Some normal optic nerve heads may appear to be swollen, due a crowding of nerve fibres entering the disc. This is termed pseudopapilloedema and occurs particularly in small, hypermetropic eyes where the nerve entry site is reduced in size. Note also that myelinated nerve fibres occurring on the nerve head may be mistaken for optic disc swelling. During development, myelination of the optic nerve begins proximally and spreads centrifugally to be completed at the lamina cribrosa at term. Occasionally, as a developmental variant, the process extends into the peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer as a patch of lightscattering, myelinated fibres; the normally unmyelinated retinal nerve fibre layer is partly myelinated, giving it a feathery, white appearance which reflects the organization of the nerve fibre layer. In myopia it is common to see a pale ‘myopic crescent’ of peripapillary atrophy, at the temporal margin of the optic disc. In high myopia the optic disc may be surrounded by such an atrophic area (peripapillary atrophy), which may be confused with disc swelling.</p>

    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">History</h4>
    <p>The crucial feature of disc swelling due to raised intracranial pressure is that there is rarely an associated visual loss, although some patients, with advanced papilloedema, may develop fleeting visual loss lasting seconds when they alter posture from lying to standing (obscurations of vision).</p>
    <p>Other important clues to the presence of raised intracranial pressure include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>headache, worse on waking and made worse by coughing;</li>
        <li>nausea, retching;</li>
        <li>diplopia (double vision), usually due to a sixth nerve palsy;</li>
        <li>other neurological signs, if the raised pressure is due to a cranial spaceoccupying lesion – visual field loss; cranial nerve palsy;</li>
        <li>a history of head trauma suggesting a subdural haemorrhage;</li>
        <li>a history of medications sometimes associated with raised intracranial pressure (e.g. oral contraceptives, tetracyclines).</li>

    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Signs</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The optic disc is swollen, its edges are blurred and the superficial capillaries are dilated and thus abnormally prominent. There is no spontaneous venous pulsation of the central retinal vein. This has a physiological basis. The central retinal vein is exposed to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as it leaves the optic nerve to join the veins of the orbit. Normally, venous pressure in the retinal veins at the nerve head is just above ocular pressure. Venous pulsation occurs because the vein collapses briefly with each rise in ocular pressure with arterial inflow. When the CSF pressure is higher than the ocular pressure, as occurs in papilloedema due to raised intracranial pressure, the pressure in the veins at the disc rises above the ocular pressure and so spontaneous venous pulsation is lost. Absence of spontaneous venous pulsation is seen in 5–20% of those with normal nerve heads, but in this case venous collapse at the nerve head can be induced by light pressure on the globe.</li>
        <li>A large blind spot will be found on visual field testing, corresponding to the swollen nerve head. In chronic papilloedema the field may become constricted. A field defect may, however, be caused by the space-occupying lesion causing the papilloedema.</li>
        <li>Abnormal neurological signs may indicate the site of a space-occupying lesion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Investigation</h4>
    <p>CT and MRI scanning will identify any space-occupying lesion or enlargement of the ventricles. Following neurological consultation (and normally after a scan) a lumbar puncture will enable intracranial pressure to be measured. Treatment is dependent on findings.</p>

    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Idiopathic intracranial hypertension treatment</h4>
    <p>Intracranial pressure may be elevated and disc swelling present with no evidence of intracranial abnormality and no dilation of the ventricles on the scan. This is termed idiopathic intracranial hypertension (previously, benign intracranial hypertension) and usually presents in overweight women in the second and third decades. It may also be caused by exposure to certain drugs such as the contraceptive pill and tetracyclines. Patients complain of headache and may have obscurations of vision and sixth nerve palsies. No other neurological problems are present. Although acute permanent visual loss is not a feature of papilloedema, if the nerve remains swollen for several weeks there will be a progressive contraction of the visual field. It is thus important to reduce intracranial pressure. This may be achieved:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>with medications such as oral acetazolamide;</li>
        <li>through ventriculoperitoneal shunting;</li>
        <li>through optic nerve decompression, where a small hole is made in the sheath surrounding the optic nerve to allow the drainage of CSF and reduce the pressure of CSF around the anterior optic nerve.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Space-occupying lesions (i.e. tumours and haemorrhage) and hydrocephalus require neurosurgical management.</p>
