                        <p>A 70-year-old woman presents to the eye casualty department with sudden loss of vision in her right eye. She has noted increasing headache and her scalp is tender when she combs her hair. She complains of pain in the jaw when she eats, and tires easily. There is no ophthalmic history but she suffers from peptic ulceration. She takes no regular medications. There is no family history of medical problems.</p>
                        <p>Examination reveals a visual acuity of counting fingers in the affected eye. A relative afferent pupillary defect is present (see Chapter 2). The optic disc appears slightly swollen (Figure 19.1). The left eye is normal.</p>

                        <p>The patient almost certainly has giant cell arteritis causing ischaemic optic neuropathy (see Chapter 14). Intravenous and oral steroids must be given immediately before any other diagnostic step is taken, for there is a risk of arteritis and blindness in the fellow eye.</p>
                        <p>An ESR, C-reactive protein and temporal artery biopsy will help to confirm the diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>As the patient is being treated with steroids it is important to obtain a chest radiograph to exclude tuberculosis (TB) (steroids may promote miliary TB if pulmonary TB is present). Blood pressure and blood glucose must be monitored. The patient should be warned of the other complications of steroid therapy, including immunosuppressive effects. Treatment to prevent osteoporosis is required. A positive history of gastric ulceration demands prophylactic treatment with a proton pump inhibitor.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="case-2" class="subsection-heading">Case 2</h3>
                        <p>A 40-year-old man presents with sudden onset of a drooping left eyelid. When he lifts the lid with his finger he notices that he has double vision. He has a severe headache. He is otherwise fit and well with no past ophthalmic history. He is on no regular medication. There is no family history of medical problems.</p>
                        <p>Examination reveals normal visual acuity in both eyes. A left ptosis is present. The left pupil is dilated. The left eye is abducted in the primary position of gaze. Testing eye movements reveals reduced adduction, elevation and depression of the left eye. The remainder of the eye examination is normal.</p>

                        <h4>Answers</h4>
                        <p>The man has a third nerve palsy (see Chapter 15). An aneurysm from the posterior communicating artery pressing on the third nerve must be the initial diagnosis in a painful third nerve palsy. The patient requires urgent neurosurgical investigation with a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) and possibly angiography. Urgent treatment may be required. It is also important to check blood pressure and blood glucose. Diabetics may develop a painful third nerve palsy, but the pupil is not always affected (a 'pupil-sparing third nerve palsy').</p>

                        <p>A 55-year-old man presents to his GP with a 5-day history of the sudden onset of floaters in the left eye. These were accompanied by small flashes of light. He has treated hypertension but no other medical problems.</p>
                        <p>The GP examines the eye and finds a normal visual acuity. Dilated fundoscopy reveals no abnormality.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Questions</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What should the GP advise?</li>

                        <h4>Answers</h4>
                        <p>As the symptoms are acute the GP should arrange for an urgent ophthalmic assessment. The man has a posterior vitreous detachment. With careful ophthalmoscopy it will be possible to identify vitreous opacities in keeping with this diagnosis. The flashing lights are caused by traction of the detached vitreous gel on the retina. A specialized examination of the peripheral retina is needed. A tear may occur in the retina, which in turn may lead to a retinal detachment. Laser applied around the tear while it is flat can prevent retinal detachment (see Chapter 11).</p>

                        <p>A 75-year-old woman attends the main casualty department with nausea and vomiting. She says that her right eye is painful and red. Vision is reduced. She is longsighted and wears glasses for near and distance vision. She is generally fit. There is no family history of medical problems.</p>
                        <p>On examination the casualty officer finds the vision to be reduced to counting fingers in the right eye. The eye is red, the cornea appears cloudy and oedematous, and the pupil is oval and dilated on the affected side. No view of the fundus is obtained.</p>

                        <p>The lady is longsighted and has acute angle closure glaucoma (see Chapter 10). Tonometry would reveal an intraocular pressure of about 65 mm Hg (see Chapter 2). If possible through the cloudy cornea, gonioscopy would confirm the presence of a closed angle and a narrow angle in the fellow eye (see Chapter 10). This can also be seen using high resolution ultrasound or confocal microscopy. The pressure must be lowered with intravenous acetazolamide and topical hypotensive drops, including pilocarpine, to produce miosis. A peripheral iridotomy is then performed, usually with a YAG laser, in both eyes, to prevent further attacks.</p>

                        <p>A 28-year-old man presents to his optician with a painful, red right eye. The vision has become increasingly blurred over the last 2 days. He wears soft contact lenses, and contact lens tolerance has decreased in the preceding days. The optician notes that the vision is reduced to 6/60 in the right eye, the conjunctiva is inflamed, and there is a central opacity on the cornea. A small hypopyon (see Chapter 9) is present (Figure 19.2).</p>

                        <p>The man has a bacterial corneal ulcer secondary to contact lens wear. He requires immediate referral to an ophthalmic casualty unit. The ulcer will be scraped for culture and the contact lens and any lens containers cultured. Intensive, topical, broad-spectrum antibiotics are administered as an inpatient pending the result of the microbiological investigation (see Chapter 7).</p>

                        <p>A mother attends her GP's surgery with her baby, now 8 months old. He has had a persistently watery eye since birth. Intermittently there is a yellow discharge surrounding the eye. The white of the eye has never been red. The baby is otherwise healthy.</p>
                        <p>Examination reveals a white, quiet, normal eye. Slight pressure over the lacrimal sac produces a yellowish discharge from the normal puncta.</p>

                        <p>It is likely that the child has nasolacrimal obstruction due to an imperforate nasolacrimal duct. The mother should be reassured that this often resolves spontaneously. The lids should be kept clean and the region overlying the lacrimal sac massaged gently on a daily basis. Antibiotics are generally not effective. If the symptoms persist after the child's first birthday the child can be referred to an ophthalmologist for syringing and probing of the nasolacrimal duct (see Chapter 6).</p>

                        <p>Examination reveals marked lid swelling, a tender globe and, on manual opening of the lids, a proptosis with chemotic injected conjunctiva. Eye movements are limited in all directions. Visual acuity and colour vision are normal, and there is no relative afferent pupillary defect (see Chapter 2). The optic disc and retina also appear normal.</p>

                        <p>The man has orbital cellulitis (see Chapter 4). Blood cultures and a high nasal swab should be performed, together with an orbital CT scan, to confirm the diagnosis and delineate any abscess. He requires admission to hospital for intravenous antibiotics and close monitoring of his vision, colour vision and pupillary reflexes, as he is at risk of severe optic nerve damage. The ENT surgeons should be informed, as they may be required to drain an abscess. The normal acuity and colour vision suggest that the optic nerve is not compromised at present, but should these signs worsen, urgent surgical drainage will be required.</p>

                        <p>The eyes must be washed out with copious quantities (litres) of water immediately. Acids and particularly alkalis are very toxic to the eye. Failure to treat immediately may result in permanent, severe ocular damage (see Chapter 16). The patient should then be taken to an eye emergency clinic.</p>

                        <p>The patient has iritis (see Chapter 9). Examination would reveal a reduction in visual acuity, redness of the eye that is worse at the limbus, cells in the anterior chamber and possibly on the cornea (keratic precipitate) or a collection at the bottom of the anterior chamber (hypopyon). The iris may be stuck to the lens (posterior synechiae). There may be inflammation of the vitreous and retina. The patient is treated with steroid eye drops to reduce the inflammation and dilating drops to prevent the formation of posterior synechiae. The history of backache suggests that the patient may have ankylosing spondylitis.</p>

                        <p>It is likely that the lady has a cataract. These can be readily seen with a slit lamp, but are also well visualized with the direct ophthalmoscope in the red reflex (Figure 19.4).

                        <p>The rapid onset suggests that the cataract has little to do with the new visual disturbance. It is most likely due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (see Chapter 11). In some patients, with wet AMD, where a fibrovascular membrane grows beneath the macula that can be shown on a fluorescein angiogram, anti-VEGF injections into the vitreous may be helpful in preventing further progression and in some cases improving vision.</p>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Answers</h4>
                        <p>It is likely that a piece of steel travelling at high velocity has penetrated the cornea, traversed the iris (resulting in the hyphaema) and passed into or through the lens (causing the opacity). The relatively good acuity suggests that there has been no damage to the macula. The patient needs to be seen urgently in an eye unit. The corneal wound, if self-sealing, will probably not require suturing. The exact location of the foreign body has to be determined. Although it is unlikely to cause an infection (heat generated by the impact of the hammer on the metal may effectively sterilize the fragment) it may cause retinal toxicity if it has entered the vitreous cavity or retina. If it is enclosed in the lens (Figure 19.6) there is less chance of retinal toxicity developing but the patient is at high risk of developing a subsequent cataract that may require an operation. A foreign body that impacts on the retina or the vitreous body requires a vitrectomy to remove it, with careful examination of the retina for tears (see Chapter 16).</p>

                        <h4>Answer</h4>
                        <p>Having taken a full history, an orthoptist will measure the visual acuity of the child, examine the range of eye movements, determine the presence type of squint with a cover test, trying to assess the degree of binocular vision present. The child will have a refraction performed and glasses prescribed if there is a significant refractive error or a difference in the strength of the lens needed between the two eyes (anisometropia). An ophthalmologist will examine the eye to check that there is no ocular or neurological condition that may account for the squint (see Chapter 15) and can discuss any future need for surgery.</p>

                        <p>The patient has the typical symptoms and signs of optic neuritis (see Chapter 14). The diagnosis can be supported by an MRI scan to look for additional plaques of demyelination and a visual evoked potential to examine the functioning of the optic nerve. A neurologist may also suggest performing a lumbar puncture, particularly if there is any doubt about the diagnosis. With the possibility of a previous neurological episode it is likely that the patient has multiple sclerosis. It is of great importance that appropriate counselling is given. Steroid treatment may speed up the recovery of vision and the prognosis for recovery of vision over a few months is good.</p>

                        <p>The patient has blepharitis (see Chapter 5). Scaling of the lid margins and at the base of the lashes, together with inflammation of the lid margins and plugging of the meibomian glands, may be present (Figure 19.8). Lid cleaning, along with the use of local antibiotic ointment and possibly topical steroids (supervised by an ophthalmologist), will improve, if not alleviate, the symptoms. Heat and lid massage can restore oil flow.
