                        <p>Ophthalmic diagnosis is heavily dependent on a good history and a thorough examination. The majority of ophthalmic diagnoses do not require additional tests. The sequence of history and examination is described below. It is imperative that hands are washed before and after each examination. If ocular infection is suspected then it may be necessary to disinfect the slit lamp and other hand-held equipment. Equipment making contact with the eye, e.g. a diagnostic contact lens, is either disposable or routinely disinfected.</p>

                        <p>The symptoms associated with specific eye disease are detailed here to enable you to form an overview of the important questions to ask in the ophthalmic history. You should revise this section when you have read more about the specific conditions described.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="red-eye" class="subsection-heading">Red eye</h3>
                        <p>A red eye is one of the most common presenting complaints in ophthalmology. It means redness of the exposed white of the eye, i.e. the exposed conjunctiva and underlying sclera. It is associated with infection, inflammation, trauma and acute elevation of intraocular pressure (Table 2.2). Determining associated symptoms will help establish the diagnosis (Table 2.3).</p>
                        
                        <h4 id="trauma-red-eye" class="subsubsection-heading">Trauma</h4>
                        <p>A traumatic cause is usually obvious. Your history should note details of the event and whether this was due to blunt injury, a sharp object or a high-speed projectile. High-speed metal fragments from hammering may penetrate the globe and threaten sight. The patient may be entirely unaware of any ocular injury.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Subconjunctival haemorrhage</strong> is bright red due to exposure to ambient oxygen levels, and obscures the white of the sclera. It may be traumatic or spontaneous, or may be associated with systemic hypertension or bloodclotting disorders including anticoagulant therapy (the international normalized ratio (INR) may need checking).</li>
                            <li><strong>Corneal foreign bodies and abrasions</strong> cause extreme pain and epiphora (watering). Sensory innervation is nociceptive, and higher than in any other part of the body, e.g. it is 400 times greater than in the fingertip. Corneal injury stimulates reflex antidromic vasodilatation of limbal episcleral vessels, termed a limbal or ciliary flush. This characteristic sign is often in the meridian of the lesion, aiding its detection, or it may surround the limbus when trauma is associated with iritis. Trauma can also cause conjunctival injection (vessel dilation).</li>
                            <li><strong>Chemical injury</strong> may be associated with generalized or local conjunctival inflammation, but alkali burns may cause ischaemic whitening, signifying severe tissue damage.</li>

                        <h4 id="infection-red-eye" class="subsubsection-heading">Infection</h4>
                        <p>The commonest site of infection is the conjunctiva itself.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Conjunctivitis</strong> is a generalized inflammation of the conjunctiva associated with symptoms of discharge and mild discomfort rather than pain. Any visual blur due to discharge is cleared on blinking. Bacterial infections are associated with a purulent discharge that may stick the lids together. Viral infections cause a more watery discharge. In severe cases, where the cornea is affected, the patient experiences photophobia and blurred vision. Chlamydial infections can produce a chronically red eye.</li>
                            <li><strong>Malposition of the lids</strong> (e.g. entropion) and lid margin inflammation (blepharitis) may cause secondary inflammation of the conjunctiva due to recurrent irritation. Blepharitis is usually without discharge and may be associated with acne rosacea, atopic dermatitis and other skin diseases. The patient complains of lid irritation or itching. In some cases, staphylococcal lid margin commensals may induce a hypersensitivity (immune complex) reaction in the peripheral cornea resulting in a marginal keratitis or ulcer, just central to the limbal vascular arcade. This is accompanied by a ciliary injection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Corneal infection</strong> affecting the visual axis is sight-threatening and may be associated with localized or general ocular redness. The eye is painful, particularly in acanthamoeba keratitis, and the vision reduced. There may be a mucopurulent discharge. A background history of contact lens use is common as an initiating factor.</li>
                            <li><strong>Intraocular infection (endophthalmitis)</strong> may occasionally occur within days following intraocular surgery. It causes a marked generalized conjunctival inflammation. The eye is painful (unusual after routine intraocular surgery) and the vision reduced. A history of recent surgery is the clue. Such a patient requires immediate referral to an eye unit.</li>
                            <li>An infection of the orbit, <strong>orbital cellulitis</strong>, presents with swollen and often erythematous lids. The conjunctiva may be oedematous (chemotic) and red, and eye movements are reduced. The eye is proptosed. This is a medical emergency, for vision may be lost rapidly, due to optic nerve damage.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The sudden rise in pressure associated with acute angle closure glaucoma, and other causes of acute glaucoma, result in a generalized red eye, corneal clouding, reduced vision and severe pain. It needs urgent treatment.</p>

                        <h4 id="other-inflammation" class="subsubsection-heading">Other forms of inflammation</h4>
                        <p>A number of other inflammatory diseases may present with a red eye, of which the commonest, mainly seen in primary care, is allergic eye disease.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis</strong>, or hayfever conjunctivitis, is a common disorder, particularly in the spring and summer when exposure to allergens is at its height. The conjunctiva is injected and may be chemosed; the eye itches and waters and there is accompanying sneezing (due to allergic rhinitis) as part of the overall picture of hayfever. Vision is unaffected, but the eye may be photophobic. <strong>Vernal keratoconjunctivitis</strong>, a chronic form of allergic eye disease, will also present as a red, itching, irritable eye and vision may be affected. There may be a history of atopy. With both there may be a mucus discharge.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dry eyes</strong> may also be associated with mild redness, irritation and ‘tiredness’ of the eye. In severe cases the vision may be blurred.</li>
                            <li>In <strong>episcleritis</strong> the episcleral tissues are inflamed. This may result in focal or diffuse inflammation, and may or may not be painful. There is no discharge, and the vision is not reduced.</li>
                            <li>In <strong>scleritis</strong>, inflammation of the sclera is associated with the collagen vascular diseases. Focal or generalized inflammation and swelling of the sclera is seen through the conjunctiva, which is also swollen. Pain is deep and boring.</li>
                            <li>Other conjunctival or corneal lesions, for example <strong>pterygia</strong> and <strong>pingueculae</strong>, may present with focal redness. They are easily visible.</li>
                            <li>A red eye may be associated with topical medication, for example the prostaglandin analogues used in the treatment of glaucoma.</li>
