\section*{Introduction}

The retina is subject to an enormous range of disease, both inherited and acquired. Some are common, with significant socioeconomic importance (e.g. age-related macular degeneration), while others are much rarer (for example some of the macular dystrophies). The impact on the individual may be profound in either case. Diseases of the macula, particularly if bilateral, result in a profound reduction in visual acuity. Despite the variety of diseases, the symptoms are relatively stereotyped. These will be described first. In this chapter both hereditary and acquired disease of the vitreous, neuroretina, retinal pigment epithelium and choroid will be described. In the chapter which follows the effects of disorders of the retinal circulation will be explored.

\section*{Symptoms of retinal disease}

\section*{Macular dysfunction}

The central part of the macula (the fovea) is responsible for fine resolution. Disorders of this relatively small part of the retina cause significant visual impairment. The patient may complain of:
- Blurred central vision.
- Distorted vision (metamorphopsia) caused by a disturbance in the arrangement of the photoreceptors such as that which occurs in macular oedema. A reduction (micropsia) or enlargement (macropsia) of object size may also occur if the photoreceptors become stretched apart or compressed together.
- The patient may notice areas of loss of the central visual field (scotomata) if part of the photoreceptor layer becomes covered, e.g. by blood, or if the photoreceptors are destroyed.

\section*{Peripheral retinal dysfunction}

The patient complains of:
- Loss of visual field (usually detected clinically when a significant amount of the peripheral retina is damaged). Small areas of damage, e.g. small haemorrhages, do not produce clinically detectable defects. The field loss may be absolute, for example in a branch retinal artery occlusion, or relative (i.e. brighter or larger objects are visible) as in a retinal detachment.
- Some diseases affecting the retina may predominantly affect one type of photoreceptor; in retinitis pigmentosa the rods are principally affected so that night vision is reduced (night blindness).

\section*{Acquired macular disease}

Acquired disease at the macula may destroy part or all of the thickness of the retina (e.g. age-related macular degeneration or a macular hole). In a number of conditions this damage is dramatically magnified by the growth of new vessels from the choroid through Bruch's membrane and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), causing haemorrhage or exudation of fluid into the subretinal space and subsequent scarring of the retina. The neuroretina ceases to function if it is detached from the RPE, so these changes cause marked disruption of macular function even before direct retinal damage occurs.

Fluid may also accumulate within the layers of the retina at the macula (cystoid macular oedema) if the normal tight junctions of the retinal capillaries that form the inner blood-retinal barrier break down. This may occur following
intraocular surgery, such as cataract surgery. The retina and sub-retinal layers may also become separated by diffusion of fluid from the choriocapillaris through an abnormal region of the retinal pigment epithelium. This represents a breakdown of the outer blood-retinal barrier between the choroid and the retina, and is termed central serous retinopathy. It may occur unilaterally, as a potentially reversible disorder particularly in young men.

\section*{Age-related macular degeneration}

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the commonest cause of irreversible visual loss in the developed world (Figure 11.1).

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\section*{Pathogenesis}

The RPE removes and processes the used discs of the photoreceptor outer segments. Over time, undigested lipid products, such as the age pigment lipofuscin, accumulate in the RPE and the excess material is transferred to Bruch's membrane, impairing its diffusional properties. Extracellular deposits form between the RPE and Bruch's membrane which can be seen with the ophthalmoscope as discrete, sub-retinal yellow lesions called drüsen. Collections of these drüsen in the macula give rise to the condition termed age-related maculopathy or ARM where vision is normal. The neighbouring RPE and photoreceptors may also show degenerative changes, producing the dry or non-exudative form of AMD. In the less common, exudative or 'wet' form, new vessels from the choroid, stimulated by angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), grow through Bruch's membrane and the RPE into the sub-retinal space, where they form a sub-retinal neovascular membrane. Subsequent haemorrhage into the sub-retinal space or even through the retina into the vitreous is associated with profound visual loss.

\section*{Symptoms}

The symptoms are those of macular dysfunction outlined above.

\section*{Signs}

The usual foveal reflex is absent. Yellow, well circumscribed drüsen may be seen, and there may be areas of hypo- and hyperpigmentation. In exudative AMD sub-retinal, or more occasionally pre-retinal, haemorrhages may be seen. The experienced observer may detect elevation of the retina stereoscopically.

\section*{Investigation}

Diagnosis is based on the appearance of the retina. In patients with a suspected exudative AMD and with vision that is not severely affected, a fluorescein angiogram is performed to delineate the position of the sub-retinal neovascular membrane. The position of the membrane determines whether or not the patient may benefit from laser treatment.

\section*{Treatment}

There is no treatment for non-exudative AMD. Patients with visual loss in one eye (visual loss $\mathrm{t}<6 / 24$ from non-exudative or exudative disease) and high risk features in the fellow eye or bilateral high risk features but normal vision (large or confluent drüsen or significant hypo- and hyperpigmentation) may benefit from high-dose antioxidant vitamins and zinc. Betacarotene is, however, avoided in smokers or those who have recently stopped smoking because of the increased risk of lung cancer. Smoking itself is associated with an increased
risk of developing haemorrhagic, exudative AMD and patients should be encouraged to stop.

Vision is maximized with low-vision aids including magnifiers and telescopes and closed-circuit television devices (CCTV). The patient must be reassured that although central vision has been lost, the disease will not spread to affect the peripheral vision. Therefore navigational vision is retained. This is a vital message, since many patients fear that they will become totally blind.

Patients with exudative AMD, where the fluorescein angiogram reveals a subretinal vascular membrane can be treated with drugs inhibiting the action of angiogenic factors such as VEGF. These drugs retard angiogenesis and cause regression of existing new vessels. Anti-VEGF agents are currently given by repeated injections into the vitreous cavity. They reduce visual loss and restore the normal anatomical appearance of the macula. In some patients vision may improve. This treatment represents a major advance in the therapy of this disease.

\section*{Other degenerative conditions associated with the formation of sub-retinal neovascular membranes}
- Degenerative changes and sub-retinal neovascular membranes may also occur at the maculae of very myopic patients and can cause loss of central vision, particularly in young adulthood.
- Sub-retinal neovascular membranes may also grow through elongated cracks in Bruch's membrane called angioid streaks (Figure 11.2). These are seen classically in the rare recessive disorder pseudoxanthoma elasticum, and uncommonly in systemic diseases such as Paget's disease and sickle cell

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 11.2 The clinical appearance of angioid streaks in pseudoxanthoma elasticum. The arrow indicates a streak.}
\end{figure}
disease. Again there may be a profound reduction in central vision. Vision is also reduced if the crack itself passes through the fovea.

\section*{Macular holes and membranes}

A well circumscribed hole may form at the centre of the macular region and destroy the fovea, resulting in a major loss of acuity (Figure 11.3). It results from vitreous traction on the thin macular retina. The early stages of hole formation may be associated with visual distortion and mild blurring of vision.
Unlike peripheral retinal holes, macular holes are not usually associated with retinal detachment. Most are idiopathic in origin, but they may be associated with blunt trauma. Much interest is being shown in the treatment of macular holes with vitreous surgery to relieve the traction on the retina. The degree of visual improvement depends on the initial vision, the duration of symptoms and the stage (severity) of the macular hole. No other treatment is available.
A pre-retinal glial membrane may form over the macular region, whose contraction causes puckering of the retina and again results in blurred and distorted of vision. These symptoms may be improved by removing the membrane with microsurgical vitrectomy techniques.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 11.4 The pattern of fluid accumulation in central serous retinopathy.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Central serous retinopathy}

Here, a localized accumulation of fluid between the neuro retina and the RPE separates the two layers and disturbs the photoreceptor layer. It results from a localized breakdown in the normal barrier function of the RPE. It is usually unilateral and typically affects young or middle-aged males. Patients complain of distortion and blurred vision and visual acuity may fall markedly. Examination reveals a dome-shaped elevation of the retina (Figure 11.4).

Treatment is not usually required, as the condition is self-limiting. Occasionally, in intractable cases or those where the vision is severely affected, the argon laser can be used to seal the point of leakage identified with a fluorescein angiogram.

\section*{Macular oedema}

This extracellular accumulation of fluid within the retina is a further cause of distorted and blurred vision (Figure 11.5). Ophthalmoscopy reveals a loss of the normal foveal reflex and with experience a rather cystic appearance to the fovea. If the diagnosis is in doubt a confirmatory optical coherence tomogram (OCT) scan (Figure 11.5) or a fluorescein angiogram can be performed. The fluorescein leaks into the oedematous retina in a characteristic pattern (see Chapter 2).

Macular oedema may be associated with numerous and diverse eye disorders, including:
- intraocular surgery;
- uveitis;
- retinal vascular disease (e.g. diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion);
- retinitis pigmentosa.

Treatment can be difficult and is dependent on the associated eye disease. Steroids in high doses are helpful in macular oedema caused by uveitis; acetazolamide may be helpful in treating patients with retinitis pigmentosa or following intraocular surgery.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

Prolonged macular oedema can cause the formation of a lamellar macular hole.

\section*{Toxic maculopathies}

The accumulation of some drugs in the RPE can cause macular damage. These include the antimalarials chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, used quite widely in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other connective-tissue disorders, which may cause a toxic maculopathy. Chloroquine is the more toxic. Patients on chloroquine require regular visual assessment for maculopathy (Figure 11.6). The maculopathy is initially only detected by accurate assessment of macular function. At this early stage, discontinuation of the drug reverses the maculopathy. Later, a pigmentary target lesion is seen ophthalmoscopically, associated with metamorphopsia and an appreciable and irreversible loss of central vision. Ocular toxicity is unlikely with a dose of less than 4 mg (chloroquine phosphate) per kg lean body weight per day or a total cumulative dose of less than 300 g . Screening of patients on hydroxychloroquine, at the recommended dose, although still advised, is questioned by some.

Phenothiazines (thioridazine particularly) used in high doses for prolonged periods (to treat psychoses) may cause retinal damage.

Tamoxifen, in high doses, may cause a maculopathy.

\end{figure}

\section*{Vitreous floaters and posterior vitreous detachment}

With ageing, the vitreous gel undergoes degenerative changes over the age of 60 (earlier in myopes), with liquefaction and the formation of fragments of condensed vitreous. They cast shadows on the retina, giving rise to the common symptom of vitreous 'floaters'. These take the form of spots or cobwebs which obscure vision only slightly and move when the eyes move, reflecting the fluid nature of the vitreous. Symptoms are most marked on bright days, when the small pupil throws a sharper image on the retina.

Sometimes, in older patients or myopes, the vitreous gel collapses and separates from points of retinal attachment, a condition termed a posterior vitreous detachment (Figure 11.7). This gives rise to acute symptoms of:
- photopsia (flashing lights) - due to traction on the peripheral retina by the detaching vitreous;
- a shower of floaters - representing condensations within the collapsed vitreous, or sometimes a vitreous haemorrhage caused when the detaching vitreous ruptures a small blood vessel during the formation of a retinal tear or hole.

For this reason presentation with recent symptoms of an acute vitreous detachment is an indication for full assessment of the vitreous and peripheral retina with full pupil dilation.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 11.7 Ultrasound picture showing a posterior vitreous detachment. Note that the vitreous is still attached at the optic disc.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Retinal detachment}

A retinal detachment is an ophthalmic emergency requiring urgent diagnosis and treatment.

\section*{Pathogenesis}

The potential space between the neuroretina and its pigment epithelium corresponds to the cavity of the embryonic optic vesicle. The two tissues are loosely attached in the mature eye and may become separated:
- If a tear occurs in the retina, allowing liquefied vitreous to gain entry to the sub-retinal space. This causes a progressive, rhegmatogenous, retinal detachment which may be partial or total.
- If it is pulled off by contracting fibrous tissue on the retinal surface, e.g. in the proliferative retinopathy of diabetes mellitus (traction retinal detachment).
- When, rarely, fluid accumulates in the sub-retinal space as a result of an exudative process, which may occur with retinal tumours or during toxaemia of pregnancy (exudative retinal detachment).

Tears in the retina are most commonly associated with the onset of a posterior vitreous detachment. As the gel separates from the retina the traction it exerts (vitreous traction) becomes more localized and thus greater. Occasionally it may be sufficient to tear the retina. An underlying peripheral weakness of the retina such as lattice degeneration increases the probability of a tear forming
when the vitreous pulls on the retina. Highly myopic people have a significantly increased risk of developing retinal detachment.

\section*{Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment}

\section*{Epidemiology}

About 1 in 10000 of the normal population will suffer a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (Figure 11.8). The risk is greater in patients who:
- are high myopes;
- have undergone cataract surgery, particularly if this was complicated by vitreous loss;
- have experienced a detached retina in the fellow eye;
- have been subjected to recent severe eye trauma.

\section*{Symptoms}

Retinal detachment may be preceded by symptoms of a posterior vitreous detachment, including floaters and flashing lights. With the onset of the retinal detachment itself the patient notices the progressive development of a field defect, often described as a 'shadow' or 'curtain'. Progression may be rapid

\begin{figure}

\caption{Figure 11.9 The clinical appearance of a retinal detachment. Note the retinal tear. The retina has completely detached.}
\end{figure}
when a superior detachment is present. If the macula becomes detached there is a marked fall in visual acuity.

\section*{Signs}

The detached retina is visible on ophthalmoscopy as a floating, diaphanous membrane which partly obscures choroidal vascular detail. If there is a marked accumulation of fluid in the sub-retinal space (a bullous retinal detachment) undulating movements of the retina will be observed as the eye moves. A tear in the retina appears reddish pink because of the underlying choroidal vessels. There may be associated debris in the vitreous comprising blood (vitreous haemorrhage) and pigment, or the free-floating lid (operculum) of a retinal hole (Figure 11.9).

\section*{Management}

There are two major surgical techniques for repairing a retinal detachment (Figure 11.10):

1 external (conventional approach);
2 internal (vitreoretinal surgery).
The essential principle behind both techniques is to close the causative break in the retina and to increase the strength of attachment between the surrounding retina and the RPE by inducing inflammation in the region, either by local freezing with a cryoprobe or with a laser. In the external approach the break is closed by indenting the sclera with an externally located strip of silicone sponge (or plomb). This relieves the vitreous traction on the retinal hole and apposes the retinal pigment epithelium to the retina. It may first be necessary to drain an extensive accumulation of sub-retinal fluid by piercing the sclera and choroid with a needle (sclerostomy).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-192.jpg?height=1526&width=1067&top_left_y=294&top_left_x=230}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 11.10 The repair of a retinal detachment. (a) External approach: a silicone sponge has been sutured to the globe to indent the sclera over the retinal break following drainage of the sub-retinal fluid and application of cryotherapy. (b) Sagittal section of the eye showing the indent formed by the silicone sponge: the retina is now reattached and traction on the retinal break by the vitreous is relieved. (c) Internal approach: following removal of the vitreous gel and drainage of sub-retinal fluid an inert fluorocarbon gas has been injected into the vitreous cavity.}
\end{figure}

In the internal approach the vitreous is removed with a microsurgical cutter introduced into the vitreous cavity through the pars plana. This relieves the vitreous traction on the break. Fluid can be drained through the causative retinal break itself, and laser or cryotherapy applied to the surrounding retina. A temporary internal tamponade is then achieved by injecting an inert fluorocarbon gas into the vitreous cavity which is absorbed slowly. This has the effect of closing the hole from the inside and preventing further passage of fluid through the break. The patient has to maintain a particular head posture for a few days to ensure that the bubble covers the retinal break continuously. Air travel must be avoided with the gas in place because, at the reduced barometric pressure, gas expansion could cause complications such as glaucoma.
Retinal tears unassociated with sub-retinal fluid are treated prophylactically with a laser or cryoprobe to induce inflammation and increase the adhesion between the neuroretina surrounding the tear and the pigment epithelium, thus preventing a retinal detachment. It is always important to check the peripheral retina in the fellow eye, as tears or an asymptomatic retinal detachment may be present here too.

\section*{Prognosis}

If the macula is attached and the surgery successfully reattaches the peripheral retina, the outlook for vision is excellent. If the macula is detached for more than 24 hours prior to surgery, the previous visual acuity will probably not recover completely. Nonetheless a substantial part of the vision may be restored over several months. If the retina is not successfully attached and the surgery is complicated, then fibrotic changes may occur in the vitreous (proliferative vitreoretinopathy, $P V R$ ), which may cause traction on the retina and further retinal detachment. A complex vitreoretinal procedure may permit vision to be retained, but the outlook for vision is much poorer.

\section*{Traction retinal detachment}

The neuroretina is pulled away from the pigment epithelium by contracting fibrous tissue which has grown on the retinal surface. This may be seen in proliferative diabetic retinopathy or may occur as a result of proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Vitreoretinal surgery, requiring excision of the contracting bands, is required to repair these detachments. In these cases it may be necessary to inject silicone oil into the vitreous cavity, temporarily, to hold the retina flat.

\section*{Retinoschisis}

The retina splits into an inner and outer leaf at the outer plexiform and inner nuclear junction. It is usually seen in the lower temporal quadrant of the retina and is often bilateral. The appearance is not dissimilar to a retinal detachment. Rarely, it may cause a retinal detachment when there are holes in both the inner and outer retinal leaves.

\section*{Inherited retinal and photoreceptor dystrophies}

\section*{Retinitis pigmentosa}

Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited disorder of the photoreceptors which has several genotypic and phenotypic varieties. It may occur in isolation or in association with a number of other systemic diseases, such as Usher's syndrome, abetalipoproteinaemia and Laurence-Moon syndrome.

\section*{Pathogenesis}

The disease affects both types of photoreceptors, but the rods are particularly affected. The inheritance may be:
- autosomal recessive (sporadic cases are often in this category);
- autosomal dominant;
- X-linked recessive.

Several forms of retinitis pigmentosa have been shown to be due to mutations in the gene for rhodopsin.

\section*{Epidemiology}

The prevalence of this group of diseases is 1 in 4000.

\section*{Symptoms}

The age of onset, progression and prognosis are dependent on the mode of inheritance. In general the dominant form is of later onset and milder degree, while recessive and X-linked recessive forms may present in infancy or childhood. Patients notice poor night vision, visual fields become increasingly constricted and central vision may ultimately be lost.

\section*{Signs}

The three signs of typical retinitis pigmentosa (Figure 11.11) are:
$\mathbf{1}$ peripheral clumps of retinal pigmentation (termed 'bone spicule' pigmentation);
2 attenuation of the retinal arterioles;
3 disc pallor - optic atrophy.
Patients may also have cataracts at an early age and may develop macular oedema.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-195.jpg?height=644&width=659&top_left_y=296&top_left_x=484}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 11.11 The clinical appearance of the peripheral retina in retinitis pigmentosa.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Investigation}

A careful family history will help to determine the mode of inheritance. The diagnosis can usually be made clinically. Electrophysiological tests are also useful in diagnosis. The electroretinogram (ERG) response may be lost early in the disease, where there may be few clinical signs.

Recent work on mapping the genetic loci for the condition has opened new avenues for genetic counselling and determining disease mechanism.

The possibility of associated syndromes should be borne in mind. Usher's syndrome, for example, is a recessive disorder characterized by deafness and retinitis pigmentosa. Retinitis pigmentosa also occurs in mitochondrial disease.

\section*{Management}

Unfortunately nothing can be done to prevent the progression of the disease, although there may be possibilities of gene therapy in the future. Associated ocular problems can be treated. Cataracts can be removed, and macular oedema may respond to treatment with acetazolamide. Low-vision aids may be helpful for a period. The possibility of genetic counselling should be discussed with the patient.

\section*{Prognosis}

X-linked recessive and autosomal recessive disease produce the most severe visual symptoms. About $50 \%$ of all patients with retinitis pigmentosa will have an acuity of less than $6 / 60$ by the time they reach 50 .

\section*{Cone dystrophy}

This is less common than retinitis pigmentosa. It is usually autosomal dominant, but many cases are sporadic. Patients present in the first decade of life with poor vision. Examination reveals an abnormal, banded macular appearance which has been likened to a bull's-eye target. No treatment is possible but it is important to provide appropriate help, not only to maximize vision but also to help with educational problems. Genetic counselling should be offered.

\section*{Juvenile macular dystrophies}

There are a variety of inherited conditions that affect both the RPE and, secondarily, the photoreceptors. All are rare (e.g. the recessive disorder Stargardt's dystrophy) and the prognosis for vision is often poor. Once again the social and educational needs of the patient need to be assessed and genetic counselling offered.

\section*{Albinism}

These patients have defective melanin synthesis. There are two types:
1 Ocular albinism, where the lack of pigmentation is confined to the eye. This is X-linked and nearly all of the affected individuals are thus male.
2 Oculocutaneous albinism, a recessive disorder where the hair is white and the skin is pale; a few of these patients can manufacture some melanin. There is an autosomal recessive defect in either the enzyme tyrosinase (on chromosome 11) or proteins associated with the normal functioning of the enzyme (on chromosomes 5, 9 and 15).

Clinically the iris is blue and there is marked transillumination so that the red reflex is seen through the iris because of the lack of pigmentation; this also allows the lens edge to be viewed in sillhouette, through the iris. The fundus appears abnormal, with lack of a normal foveal reflex, extreme pallor and prominent visibility of the choroidal vessels. There is macular dysfunction and an abnormal projection of retinal axons to the lateral geniculate bodies. Vision is poor from birth and patients often have nystagmus.

Some patients will have associated systemic disease (e.g. the HermanskyPudlak syndrome, where there is an associated haemorrhagic diathesis, caused by abnormal platelet function, lung and renal disease).

\section*{Retinal tumours}

\section*{Retinoblastoma}

This is the commonest malignant tumour of the eye in childhood, with a frequency of 1 per 20000 births. It may be inherited as an autosomal dominant condition, but most cases are sporadic. Retinoblastoma is caused either by germinal mutations, which can be passed on to the next generation, or by somatic mutations in a single retinal cell, which cannot be genetically transmitted (the majority, some $66 \%$ of cases). The retinoblastoma gene is a tumour suppressor gene whose product (pRB) plays a key role in the cell cycle as a negative regulator of cell proliferation. Mutations remove this anti-proliferative action. The disease is initiated in fetal retinal cells exhibiting a homozygous defect in the retinoblastoma gene. In inherited retinoblastoma one mutation is inherited and the other occurs by spontaneous somatic mutation in the retina during development. The mutation rate for the gene is thought to be $8 \times 10^{-7}$, but 100000000 divisions are needed to form the adult retina - so the chance of a somatic mutation occurring in a subject with only one functioning gene is very high. For this reason, inherited retinoblastoma is frequently bilateral. The homozygous state is thus achieved by a 'double hit' event and the condition behaves as a pseudodominant disorder. The chance of developing retinoblastoma (the penetrance) in a child inheriting the genetic trait is $85 \%$. Thus, although it occurs frequently in affected families, there may be some skip generations. Sporadic retinoblastoma occurs when two spontaneous mutations occur by chance in the same primordial retinal cell. Because the chances of this occurring are low, this form of retinoblastoma is most commonly unilateral.

\section*{History and symptoms}

The child may present (at a mean age of 8 months if inherited and 25 months if sporadic) with:
- A white pupillary reflex (leucocoria) due light scatter from the pale elevated tumour at the posterior pole of the eye (Figure 11.12). Sometimes the tumour is bilateral on presentation.

Most cases present by the age of 2 years. Inherited retinoblastoma is often bilateral. When the condition is unilateral on presentation and there is no family history, inherited disease is less likely, but not excluded.

\section*{Signs}

Dilated fundoscopy shows a whitish-pink mass protruding from the retina into the vitreous cavity.

\section*{Investigations}

The diagnosis is usually a clinical one. Cerebrospinal fluid and bone marrow must be examined to check for metastatic disease.

\section*{Treatment}

Removal (enucleation) of the eye is performed in advanced cases. Radiotherapy can be used in less advanced disease, as can local cryotherapy and photocoagulation. Cryotherapy involves killing the tumour in a series of freeze-thaw cycles using an externally applied cryoprobe. Laser photocoagulation may be applied to small tumours. Metastatic disease (either by direct spread through the optic nerve or by a haematogenous route) is treated with chemotherapy. Regular follow-up and examination of the fellow eye of an affected child is required. Genetic counselling should be offered, and children with a parent who has had a retinoblastoma should be assessed from infancy, shortly after birth. It is possible to detect the mutation by molecular techniques.

\section*{Prognosis}

This depends on the extent of the disease at diagnosis. Overall, the mortality of the condition is $15 \%$. Unfortunately some $50 \%$ of children with the germinal mutation will develop a second primary tumour (e.g. an osteosarcoma of the femur) or a tumour related to treatment with radiotherapy.

\section*{Astrocytomas}

These tumours of the retina and optic nerve (Figure 11.13) are seen in patients with certain dominantly inherited systemic disorders:
- tuberose sclerosis;
- neurofibromatosis (less commonly).

They appear as white mulberry-like lesions, are seldom symptomatic and require no treatment. However, their identification may assist in the diagnosis of important systemic disease.

\section*{Choroidal lesions, including melanoma}

Pigmented fundus lesions include:
- areas of old chorioretinitis;
- choroidal naevi;
- congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE);
- the rarest disorder, malignant melanoma, which has serious implications for life.

CHRPE lesions are darker with better defined edges than a choroidal naevi; multiple lesions or lesions in both eyes may be associated with familial polyposis coli and associated colon cancer and require investigation for this.

Uveal melanomas have an incidence of 6 per 1000000 per year in white adults. It is seen very much more commonly in white than in non-white races. It usually presents from middle age onwards ( $40-70$ years). Malignant melanoma may also be seen in the ciliary body and iris, but by far the greatest number (80\%) are found in the choroid.

\section*{Symptoms}

The presence of a melanoma may be detected as a coincidental finding during ocular examination (Figure 11.14). Advanced cases may present with a visual field defect or loss of acuity. If situated in the anterior part of the choroid the

\end{figure}
enlarging tumour may cause shallowing of the anterior chamber, resulting in secondary angle closure glaucoma. In the UK it is unusual for the tumour to be so advanced that it presents with visible destruction of the eye.

\section*{Signs}

A raised, usually pigmented, lesion is visible at the back of the eye, which may be associated with an area of retinal detachment. The optic nerve may be involved.

\section*{Investigations}

The patient is investigated for systemic spread, although this is less usual than in malignant melanoma of the skin. An ultrasound scan of the eye is useful in determining the size of the tumour and can be used both for quantitative assessment and to detect tumour growth over time. Fundus photography is used in follow-up, the same way.

\section*{Treatment}

A number of therapies are available. The treatment used depends on the size and location of the tumour. Large tumours that have reduced vision, or that are close to the optic nerve, usually require removal of the eye (enucleation). Smaller tumours can be treated by:
- local excision;
- local radiation applied to the lesion by an overlying radioactive plaque;
- proton beam irradiation.

\section*{Prognosis}

This depends very much on the type of tumour (some are more rapidly growing than others) and its location (tumours involving the sclera and optic nerve carry a poorer prognosis). The existence of metastatic lesions at the time of diagnosis carries a poor prognosis. Some tumours are very slow-growing and have an excellent prognosis. Others, which extend into the optic nerve or through the sclera, are more malignant and result in secondary spread.

\section*{Metastatic tumours}

These account for the greater part of ocular malignant disease. In women the commonest site of spread is from the breast; in men the commonest source is the lung. Symptoms and signs depend on their location in the eye. They appear as a whitish lesion with little elevation, and may be multiple. Treatment is usually by external beam radiotherapy.

\section*{Answers}
1. Match the symptoms with the likely abnormal part of the retina.
a The macula.
b The inferior half of the retina.
c The rods.

\section*{2. Age-related macular degeneration}
a True. AMD is the commonest cause of irreversible visual loss in the developed world.
b True. This is a disease of the retinal pigment epithelium.
c True. This is the cause of 'wet' or exudative macular degeneration.
d False. This is a separate condition, a macular hole.
e False. It is most often untreatable. In some patients with wet macular degeneration, intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment, and rarely retinal surgery, may prevent visual deterioration.
3. Match the pictures (Figure 11.15) with the diagnoses.
a A retinal detachment.
b Age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

d Melanoma.

\section*{4. Macular oedema}
a True. See Figure 11.5.
b True. Visual acuity is affected in macular oedema.
c True. It may be seen after cataract and other intraocular surgery.
d False. It is the accumulation of fluid within the retina, there is no associated growth of blood vessels as is seen in exudative AMD.
e True. Steroids may be given topically but sub-Tenon's injection or intravitreal injection may be required.
5. A patient presents with a history of $\mathbf{3}$ days of floaters, flashing lights and then a dense, curtain-like field loss.
a False. These are the classical symptoms of a retinal detachment, patients with a retinal vein occlusion would not usually have flashes and floaters.
b True. These are indeed the classical symptoms.
c False. Although the symptoms of flashes and floaters suggest a posterior vitreous detachment, the field loss indicates that a hole has been torn in the retina, causing a retinal detachment.
d True. Surgery will be required to reattach the retina.
e False. The patient will lose the vision in the eye if urgent treatment is not given.
6. A 1 -year-old child presents with a squint. The doctor notices that the red reflex appears white.
a False. Leucocoria always requires urgent examination and investigation. Retinoblastoma is a life-threatening possibility.
b True. This is a presentation of retinoblastoma.
c False. The red reflex would be present.
d True. If there is any doubt that a red reflex is present the child requires urgent ophthalmic assessment.
e True. Retinoblastoma may be bilateral.
