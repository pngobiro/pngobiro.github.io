                            <li>A 23-year-old female presents with loss of vision in the right eye over 3 days; she also complains that the right eye is painful when she moves it. She is otherwise fit and well, with no past ocular or medical history. Examination reveals an acuity of counting fingers in the right eye, 6/6 in the left. The eye is white, the pupils equal and reactive to light, but a right relative afferent pupillary defect is present. Examination of the fundus is normal.</li>
                            <li>A 24-year-old overweight female has recently developed a headache and notices that she sees double when looking to the left. Yesterday she suddenly lost her vision for a few seconds when she rose from a chair. She is otherwise fit and well. She takes the contraceptive pill. Examination reveals normal visual acuity and colour vision. There is reduced abduction of the left eye. The eyes are quiet, intraocular pressure normal. The optic discs appear swollen. Neurological examination is normal.</li>
                            <li>A 76-year-old lady is driving her car when she notices a sudden curtain coming over the left eye. The vision is lost for about 15 minutes and then the curtain lifts. She has a history of systemic hypertension and has recently been diagnosed with diabetes. There is no other medical history. On examination you can find no abnormality.</li>
                            <li>A 72-year-old man with a previous diagnosis of glaucoma presents with a sudden loss of vision in the right eye. There is no pain. He is hypertensive. There is a family history of macular degeneration. Examination reveals a visual acuity of counting fingers in the right eye, 6/6 in the left. The eye is white, intraocular pressure is not raised. The pupils are equal and no relative afferent pupillary defect is present. Dilated fundoscopy reveals a swollen optic disc and multiple haemorrhages scattered over the retina. The retinal veins appear dilated and tortuous.</li>
                            <li>An 80-year-old lady presents with sudden loss of vision in the right eye. She complains of severe pain over the right side of her head, which is painful to touch. There is no past ocular history. She has not been able to eat recently as her jaw has been painful when she tries to chew; an appointment with the dentist has been arranged. She also feels tired and has developed a pain in her shoulders. On examination the vision in the right eye is perception of light, left eye 6/6. The eyes are white, intraocular pressure is normal. A right relative afferent pupillary defect is present. Dilated fundoscopy reveals a slightly swollen optic disc with some pale white lesions between the disc and the macula.</li>

                           <li>A 46-year-old female with a history of iritis had a cataract operation. The vision initially improved but a week later was blurred once again. There was no pain and the eye was not red.</li>

                           <li>A 82-year-old lady comes to casualty with a very painful right eye and loss of vision. Visual acuity is only hand movements in the affected eye. The cornea is cloudy and the pupil is dilated. It will take her at least an hour to see an ophthalmologist at another hospital.</li>
                           <li>A 78-year-old lady notices a sudden reduction in vision in the right eye and distortion when looking at a straight line. A fluorescein angiogram suggests that there are abnormal leaking blood vessels below the macula.</li>
                           <li>A 56-year-old man has been troubled with sore red eyes for some time. He has been diagnosed as suffering from acne rosacea. On examination he has been found to have the signs of blepharitis. This has not responded to conservative treatment with lid toilet.</li>

She had no visual problems and no diplopia. On examination her eye movements were full, no ptosis was present and the difference in pupil size was confirmed. The right pupil constricted poorly to light.</li>
                            <li>A 67-year-old man who had smoked all his life noted that his left pupil was smaller than his right and his left lid drooped slightly. On examination the findings were confirmed and both pupils reacted normally to light. The difference in pupil size was more pronounced in the dark.</li>
                            <li>An 80-year-old man with a diagnosis of glaucoma for which he had been on the same treatment for many years attended his optician. He was noted to have bilaterally small pupils which did not appear to react to light.</li>
                            <li>A 45-year-old man attended his GP with a frontal headache and reduced vision in his left eye. The GP confirmed that the vision was reduced and noted that although the pupils were equal, when a light was moved from the right to the left eye both pupils appeared to dilate. The optic nerve on the left appeared pale, that on the right was normal.</li>
                            <li>A child suspected of having a squint had been taken to the eye hospital one afternoon. The following morning his mother phoned the GP saying that his pupils were dilated.</li>

                            <li>A 63-year-old lady with hypertension notices that she has blurred vision in the right eye on waking one morning. The ophthalmologist records a reduced visual acuity, right afferent pupillary defect and a swollen optic disc surrounded by haemorrhages.</li>
                            <li>A 12-year-old boy notices that his vision is becoming increasingly poor at night. His ophthalmologist notices that his visual acuity is normal but there is pigmentation on the peripheral retina, the disc looks pale and the retinal vessels attenuated.</li>
                            <li>A 50-year-old man presents to his GP saying that he feels his peripheral vision is reduced and he often spilled the water when making a cup of tea. The GP notes that although his acuity was normal he missed the temporal letters on the Snellen chart with each eye.</li>
                            <li>A 62-year-old lady was found by her optometrist to have a raised intraocular pressure in the right eye. He noted that the optic disc appeared cupped on the right compared to the left. The eye otherwise appeared normal.</li>

                            <li>A 47-year-old lady had recently noticed that her heart seems to be racing. She was unable to sleep, increasingly anxious and perspired a lot. Her appetite had increased but her weight reduced. She also noticed that her eyes had become red and that she was troubled with diplopia.</li>
                            <li>A 72-year-old hypertensive male reported the sudden onset of horizontal diplopia. This was worse on looking to the left but not present on looking to the right. On examination he had a reduction on left abduction.</li>
                            <li>A mother took her 2-year-old son to the GP. She was concerned that the left eye was looking in. The GP confirmed the finding and noted that the eyes seemed to have a normal range of movement.</li>
                            <li>A boy aged 15 years presented to the ophthalmologist because of headache. He had no other visual symptoms. On examination his visual acuity was normal, he was found to have reduced upgaze in both eyes and light-near dissociation was present.</li>
                            <li>A 23-year-old man suffered a head injury when he fell off his motorbike. He reported diplopia on looking to the right and on looking straight ahead.</li>
                            <li>A 43-year-old woman complained of double vision. Objects appeared side by side and the problem appeared worse as the day progressed. Examined in the morning her eye movements appeared full. During the course of the examination it became apparent that an increasing ptosis affected the right eye.</li>
