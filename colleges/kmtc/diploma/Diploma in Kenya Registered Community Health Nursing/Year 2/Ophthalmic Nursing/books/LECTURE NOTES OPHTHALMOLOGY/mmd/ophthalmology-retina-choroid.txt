\section*{Learning objectives}

To understand:
$\checkmark$ The social help available to blind people.
$\checkmark$ The reasons for registering a patient in the UK.

\section*{Introduction}

Sight impairment has been variously defined. In the UK it is defined as a vision of less than $6 / 18$ to $6 / 60$ and severe sight impairment, as a vision worse than 6/60. Legally it is said to be 'so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which sight is essential'. This definition is none too helpful and each case must be assessed on its individual merits. The effects of reduced vision are influenced by:
- the speed and age at which it occurred (sudden visual loss is harder to adjust to than a gradual loss, younger people may be able to adapt better to poor vision than older people);
- whether central or peripheral vision is affected;
- the type of field defect that is present - homonymous hemianopia presents special difficulties in reading and navigation;
- the existence of other disabilities (e.g. deafness).

Help and advice are available in the UK both from local government (social services) and from voluntary organizations such as the Royal National Institute
of Blind People (RNIB). There are also numerous local groups that offer support. Help is aimed at enabling the visually impaired person to lead an independent life.

\section*{Blind registration}

In the UK, patients with poor vision who meet certain requirements can be registered as sight impaired or severely sight impaired depending on the level of visual deficit. Registration does not necessarily mean that the person can see nothing at all but helps to coordinate the services available. Not all patients wish to be registered, however, because of an assumed stigma, and it is important to discuss the subject fully with the patient. Despite the benefits that may follow registration, some patients regard it as an end to a fight against failing sight rather than a new beginning, managing the problem with all available help. It is important not to dismiss the wishes of these patients when trying to maximize their ability to manage their reduced vision. It is worth pointing out to the patient that, aside from the benefits that may affect them personally, registration contributes to the creation of national statistics about the prevalence of sight-threatening diseases and therefore can focus the attention of research and funding bodies on the need for research in specific areas.

Registration is performed by an ophthalmologist. The benefits of registration, some only available to patients registered severely sight impaired, include:
- Financial help (e.g. tax allowances, a TV licence concession, additional income support, a disability living allowance, an attendance allowance).
- Help from the social services (e.g. a specialist assessment leading to an adaptation of living accommodation).
- Exemption from directory enquiry fees.
- Public transport travel concessions, railcards, disabled parking schemes for carers.
- Help with access to work.

Patients with impaired sight, whether registered or not, may also benefit from the 'talking book and newspaper' schemes, which provide extensive recorded material. Further information is available from the RNIB website (www.rnib.org.uk).

\section*{Services for children with impaired sight}

Children with impaired sight may require additional help with education, or may be educated in special schools for the visually handicapped. The local education authority has to make a statement of the educational needs of the child. Special visual aids, including voice-activated computers and closedcircuit television, may help.

In addition, children may be eligible for the disability living allowance, which may enable parents to claim additional benefits.

\section*{Additional help}

As well as low-vision aids (see Chapter 3), various devices are available, ranging from telephones with large number buttons and guides that help with placing a signature on a cheque, to devices that indicate when a cup is filled. Closed circuit television systems are also available to transfer text at high magnification to a screen. Additionally, for some patients, training in the use of a cane or provision of a guide dog may aid mobility. Some patients may also benefit from learning Braille.

\section*{KEY POINTS}
- Assist the patient to maximize their residual vision.
- Ensure that they are aware of support services and of the benefits of partial sight or blind registeration.

\section*{PAEDIATRIC OPHTHALMOLOGY}
- Make the appropriate arrangements for the education of a poorly sighted child.

\section*{Clinical cases}

\section*{Introduction}

These case histories are designed to test your understanding of the symptoms, signs and management of ophthalmic disease that have been discussed in this book. Answers are given after each case and include references to chapters where additional information may be found.

\section*{Clinical cases}

\section*{Case 1}

A 70-year-old woman presents to the eye casualty department with sudden loss of vision in her right eye. She has noted increasing headache and her scalp is tender when she combs her hair. She complains of pain in the jaw when she eats, and tires easily. There is no ophthalmic history but she suffers from peptic ulceration. She takes no regular medications. There is no family history of medical problems.

Examination reveals a visual acuity of counting fingers in the affected eye. A relative afferent pupillary defect is present (see Chapter 2). The optic disc appears slightly swollen (Figure 19.1). The left eye is normal.

\section*{Questions}
-What is the likely diagnosis?
- What is the immediate treatment?
- How would you confirm the diagnosis?
- What other precautions would you take?

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 19.1 The appearance of the optic disc in case 1.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Answers}

The patient almost certainly has giant cell arteritis causing ischaemic optic neuropathy (see Chapter 14). Intravenous and oral steroids must be given immediately before any other diagnostic step is taken, for there is a risk of arteritis and blindness in the fellow eye.

An ESR, C-reactive protein and temporal artery biopsy will help to confirm the diagnosis.

As the patient is being treated with steroids it is important to obtain a chest radiograph to exclude tuberculosis (TB) (steroids may promote miliary TB if pulmonary TB is present). Blood pressure and blood glucose must be monitored. The patient should be warned of the other complications of steroid therapy, including immunosuppressive effects. Treatment to prevent osteoporosis is required. A positive history of gastric ulceration demands prophylactic treatment with a proton pump inhibitor.

\section*{Case 2}

A 40-year-old man presents with sudden onset of a drooping left eyelid. When he lifts the lid with his finger he notices that he has double vision. He has a severe headache. He is otherwise fit and well with no past ophthalmic history. He is on no regular medication. There is no family history of medical problems.

Examination reveals normal visual acuity in both eyes. A left ptosis is present. The left pupil is dilated. The left eye is abducted in the primary position of gaze. Testing eye movements reveals reduced adduction, elevation and depression of the left eye. The remainder of the eye examination is normal.

\section*{Questions}
- What nerve palsy is present?
-What is the most likely cause?
- What is the management?

\section*{Answers}

The man has a third nerve palsy (see Chapter 15). An aneurysm from the posterior communicating artery pressing on the third nerve must be the initial diagnosis in a painful third nerve palsy. The patient requires urgent neurosurgical investigation with a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) and possibly angiography. Urgent treatment may be required. It is also important to check blood pressure and blood glucose. Diabetics may develop a painful third nerve palsy, but the pupil is not always affected (a 'pupil-sparing third nerve palsy').

\section*{Case 3}

A 55-year-old man presents to his GP with a 5-day history of the sudden onset of floaters in the left eye. These were accompanied by small flashes of light. He has treated hypertension but no other medical problems.

The GP examines the eye and finds a normal visual acuity. Dilated fundoscopy reveals no abnormality.

\section*{Questions}
- What should the GP advise?
- What is the diagnosis?
-What are the associated risks?

\section*{Answers}

As the symptoms are acute the GP should arrange for an urgent ophthalmic assessment. The man has a posterior vitreous detachment. With careful ophthalmoscopy it will be possible to identify vitreous opacities in keeping with this diagnosis. The flashing lights are caused by traction of the detached vitreous gel on the retina. A specialized examination of the peripheral retina is needed. A tear may occur in the retina, which in turn may lead to a retinal detachment. Laser applied around the tear while it is flat can prevent retinal detachment (see Chapter 11).

\section*{Case 4}

A 75-year-old woman attends the main casualty department with nausea and vomiting. She says that her right eye is painful and red. Vision is reduced. She is longsighted and wears glasses for near and distance vision. She is generally fit. There is no family history of medical problems.

On examination the casualty officer finds the vision to be reduced to counting fingers in the right eye. The eye is red, the cornea appears cloudy and oedematous, and the pupil is oval and dilated on the affected side. No view of the fundus is obtained.

\section*{Questions}
- What is the diagnosis?
- How might it be confirmed?
- What is the treatment?

\section*{Answers}

The lady is longsighted and has acute angle closure glaucoma (see Chapter 10). Tonometry would reveal an intraocular pressure of about 65 mm Hg (see Chapter 2). If possible through the cloudy cornea, gonioscopy would confirm the presence of a closed angle and a narrow angle in the fellow eye (see Chapter $10)$. This can also be seen using high resolution ultrasound or confocal microscopy. The pressure must be lowered with intravenous acetazolamide and topical hypotensive drops, including pilocarpine, to produce miosis. A peripheral iridotomy is then performed, usually with a YAG laser, in both eyes, to prevent further attacks.

\section*{Case 5}

A 28-year-old man presents to his optician with a painful, red right eye. The vision has become increasingly blurred over the last 2 days. He wears soft contact lenses, and contact lens tolerance has decreased in the preceding days.
The optician notes that the vision is reduced to $6 / 60$ in the right eye, the conjunctiva is inflamed, and there is a central opacity on the cornea. A small hypopyon (see Chapter 9) is present (Figure 19.2).

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 19.2 The appearance of the eye in case 5.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Questions}
-What is the likely diagnosis?
- What should the optician do?

\section*{Answers}

The man has a bacterial corneal ulcer secondary to contact lens wear. He requires immediate referral to an ophthalmic casualty unit. The ulcer will be scraped for culture and the contact lens and any lens containers cultured. Intensive, topical, broad-spectrum antibiotics are administered as an inpatient pending the result of the microbiological investigation (see Chapter 7).

\section*{Case 6}

A mother attends her GP's surgery with her baby, now 8 months old. He has had a persistently watery eye since birth. Intermittently there is a yellow discharge surrounding the eye. The white of the eye has never been red. The baby is otherwise healthy.

Examination reveals a white, quiet, normal eye. Slight pressure over the lacrimal sac produces a yellowish discharge from the normal puncta.

\section*{Questions}
-What is the diagnosis?
-What advice would you give the mother?

\section*{Answers}

It is likely that the child has nasolacrimal obstruction due to an imperforate nasolacrimal duct. The mother should be reassured that this often resolves spontaneously. The lids should be kept clean and the region overlying the lacrimal sac massaged gently on a daily basis. Antibiotics are generally not effective. If the symptoms persist after the child's first birthday the child can be referred to an ophthalmologist for syringing and probing of the nasolacrimal duct (see Chapter 6).

\section*{Case 7}

A 14-year-old complains of intermittent redness and soreness of the right eye. He has noticed a small lump on the upper lid. The vision is unaffected.

Examination reveals a small, raised, umbilicated lesion on the skin of the upper lid, associated with a follicular conjunctivitis below (Figure 19.3).

\section*{Questions}
- What is the likely diagnosis?
- What is the treatment?

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-305.jpg?height=467&width=659&top_left_y=298&top_left_x=484}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 19.3 The appearance of the lid in case 7.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Answers}

It is likely that the lid lesion is a molluscum contagiosum. It is treated by excision (see Chapter 5).

\section*{Case 8}

A 35-year-old man presents to his GP with erythematous, swollen right upper and lower eyelids, worsening over the previous 2 days. He is unable to open them. He feels unwell and has a temperature.

Examination reveals marked lid swelling, a tender globe and, on manual opening of the lids, a proptosis with chemotic injected conjunctiva. Eye movements are limited in all directions. Visual acuity and colour vision are normal, and there is no relative afferent pupillary defect (see Chapter 2). The optic disc and retina also appear normal.

\section*{Questions}
- What is the diagnosis?
- What is the management?

\section*{Answers}

The man has orbital cellulitis (see Chapter 4). Blood cultures and a high nasal swab should be performed, together with an orbital CT scan, to confirm the diagnosis and delineate any abscess. He requires admission to hospital for intravenous antibiotics and close monitoring of his vision, colour vision and pupillary reflexes, as he is at risk of severe optic nerve damage. The ENT surgeons should be informed, as they may be required to drain an abscess. The normal acuity and colour vision suggest that the optic nerve is not compromised at present, but should these signs worsen, urgent surgical drainage will be required.

\section*{Case 9}

While working in the laboratory a colleague inadvertently sprays his eyes with an alkali solution.

\section*{Questions}
- What is the immediate treatment?
-What should you do next?

\section*{Answers}

The eyes must be washed out with copious quantities (litres) of water immediately. Acids and particularly alkalis are very toxic to the eye. Failure to treat immediately may result in permanent, severe ocular damage (see Chapter 16). The patient should then be taken to an eye emergency clinic.

\section*{Case 10}

A 27-year-old man presents with a 2-day history of a painful red right eye; the vision is slightly blurred and he dislikes bright lights. He is otherwise fit and well, but complains of some backache. He wears no glasses.

\section*{Questions}
- What is the likely diagnosis?
- What would you expect to find on examination of the eye?
- What treatment would you give?
-What is the eye condition likely to be associated with?

\section*{Answers}

The patient has iritis (see Chapter 9). Examination would reveal a reduction in visual acuity, redness of the eye that is worse at the limbus, cells in the anterior chamber and possibly on the cornea (keratic precipitate) or a collection at the bottom of the anterior chamber (hypopyon). The iris may be stuck to the lens (posterior synechiae). There may be inflammation of the vitreous and retina. The patient is treated with steroid eye drops to reduce the inflammation and dilating drops to prevent the formation of posterior synechiae. The history of backache suggests that the patient may have ankylosing spondylitis.

\section*{Case 11}

A 68-year-old lady presents with a mildly painful red eye and some blurring of vision. One year previously she had a corneal graft. She is on no medications and is otherwise well.

\section*{Questions}
- What is the possible diagnosis?
- What treatment should the patient be given?

\section*{Answers}

There may be a number of causes of this lady's red eye. A diagnosis of graft rejection must be considered first of all. The patient must be referred to an eye department as an emergency. If a graft rejection is confirmed, she will need intensive treatment with topical steroids to save the graft (see Chapter 7).

\section*{Case 12}

A 68-year-old hypertensive man noted a fleeting loss of vision in one eye lasting for about a minute. He described it as a curtain coming down over the vision. Recovery was complete. There was no pain.

Examination reveals no abnormality.

\section*{Questions}
- What is the diagnosis?
- What treatment would you advise?

\section*{Answers}

The patient has had an episode of amaurosis fugax, most likely caused by the passage of a fibrin-platelet embolus through the retinal circulation. The patient requires treatment with antiplatelet drugs and a cardiovascular work-up. The most likely abnormality is a plaque on the carotid artery, which may require surgery (see Chapter 12).

\section*{Case 13}

A 60-year-old lady presented to her GP with gradual loss of vision over some months. She noticed that the problem was particularly bad in bright sunshine. The eye was not painful or red. She was otherwise well.

\section*{Questions}
- What is the probable diagnosis?
- How can the diagnosis be confirmed?
- What treatment may be advised?

\section*{Answers}

It is likely that the lady has a cataract. These can be readily seen with a slit lamp, but are also well visualized with the direct ophthalmoscope in the red reflex

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-308.jpg?height=642&width=657&top_left_y=298&top_left_x=436}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 19.4 A posterior subcapsular cataract, seen in the red reflex by direct ophthalmoscopy in case 13.}
\end{figure}
(Figure 19.4). The advantages and possible complications of cataract surgery should be discussed with her once the diagnosis has been confirmed (see Chapter 8).

\section*{Case 14}

An 80-year-old lady who has already lost the vision in one eye develops distortion and reduction of vision over a few days in her good eye.

Examination reveals an acuity of 6/12, an early cataract and an abnormality at the macula (Figure 19.5).

\section*{Questions}
-What is the likely diagnosis?
-What treatment may be helpful?

\section*{Answers}

The rapid onset suggests that the cataract has little to do with the new visual disturbance. It is most likely due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (see Chapter 11). In some patients, with wet AMD, where a fibrovascular membrane grows beneath the macula that can be shown on a fluorescein angiogram, anti-VEGF injections injections into the vitreous may be helpful in preventing further progression and in some cases improving vision.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-309.jpg?height=642&width=659&top_left_y=298&top_left_x=484}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 19.5 The appearance of the macula in case 14.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Case 15}

A 30-year-old builder was using a hammer to hit a steel chisel. He felt something hit his eye and the vision became blurred. He is fit and well and there is no history of medical problems.

On examination by his GP the vision was reduced to 6/12. A fluorescein staining lesion was seen on the cornea but this appeared Seidel-negative. A small hyphaema was seen in the anterior chamber, and in the red reflex observed with a direct ophthalmoscope a well delineated lens opacity was seen. The retina appeared normal.

\section*{Questions}
- What is the cause of the reduced acuity?
- What is the likely origin of the lens opacity?
- What is the possible management of the patient?

\section*{Answers}

It is likely that a piece of steel travelling at high velocity has penetrated the cornea, traversed the iris (resulting in the hyphaema) and passed into or through the lens (causing the opacity). The relatively good acuity suggests that there has been no damage to the macula. The patient needs to be seen urgently in an eye unit. The corneal wound, if self-sealing, will probably not require suturing. The exact location of the foreign body has to be determined. Although

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-310.jpg?height=793&width=512&top_left_y=296&top_left_x=509}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 19.6 The intralenticular foreign body seen in case 15.}
\end{figure}
it is unlikely to cause an infection (heat generated by the impact of the hammer on the metal may effectively sterilize the fragment) it may cause retinal toxicity if it has entered the vitreous cavity or retina. If it is enclosed in the lens (Figure 19.6) there is less chance of retinal toxicity developing but the patient is at high risk of developing a subsequent cataract that may require an operation. A foreign body that impacts on the retina or the vitreous body requires a vitrectomy to remove it, with careful examination of the retina for tears (see Chapter 16).

\section*{Case 16}

A 2-year-old child was thought to have a squint by her parents. The finding was confirmed by her GP and she was referred to hospital.

\section*{Question}
-What examination must be conducted in hospital?

\section*{Answer}

Having taken a full history, an orthoptist will measure the visual acuity of the child, examine the range of eye movements, determine the presence type of
squint with a cover test, trying to assess the degree of binocular vision present. The child will have a refraction performed and glasses prescribed if there is a significant refractive error or a difference in the strength of the lens needed between the two eyes (anisometropia). An ophthalmologist will examine the eye to check that there is no ocular or neurological condition that may account for the squint (see Chapter 15) and can discuss any future need for surgery.

\section*{Case 17}

A 26-year-old lady presents with a 3-day history of blurring of vision in the right eye. This has become progressively worse. She also has pain caused by moving the eye. She has previously had an episode of weakness in the right arm 2 years ago, but this settled without treatment. She is otherwise fit and well.
On examination the vision was 6/60, with no improvement on looking through a pinhole. A central scotoma was present on confrontation. The eye was white and quiet with no abnormality noted save for a right relative afferent pupillary defect (see Chapter 2).

\section*{Questions}
- What is the diagnosis?
- How could this be confirmed?
- What are the management options?
- What is the prognosis?

\section*{Answers}

The patient has the typical symptoms and signs of optic neuritis (see Chapter 14). The diagnosis can be supported by an MRI scan to look for additional plaques of demyelination and a visual evoked potential to examine the functioning of the optic nerve. A neurologist may also suggest performing a lumbar puncture, particularly if there is any doubt about the diagnosis. With the possibility of a previous neurological episode it is likely that the patient has multiple sclerosis. It is of great importance that appropriate counselling is given. Steroid treatment may speed up the recovery of vision and the prognosis for recovery of vision over a few months is good.

\section*{Case 18}

A 79-year-old man presents with a lesion on his right lower lid (Figure 19.7). It has been there for some months and has gradually grown bigger. It is ulcerated and the ulcer shows a pearly margin.

\section*{Questions}
- What is the lesion?
- How should it be treated?

\end{figure}

\section*{Answers}

This is a basal cell carcinoma. It requires local excision. There is no problem with metastatic spread but local extension could cause severe problems as the tumour grows and infiltrates surrounding structures (see Chapter 5).

\section*{Case 19}

A 60-year-old man presents with tired sore eyes. He has noted that the eyelids may crust in the morning. Sometimes the white of the eye is red. The vision is unaffected. He is otherwise fit and well.

\section*{Questions}
- What is the probable diagnosis?
- What signs would you look for?
- How can this condition be treated?

\section*{Answers}

The patient has blepharitis (see Chapter 5). Scaling of the lid margins and at the base of the lashes, together with inflammation of the lid margins and plugging of the meibomian glands, may be present (Figure 19.8). Lid cleaning, along with the use of local antibiotic ointment and possibly topical steroids (supervised by an ophthalmologist), will improve, if not alleviate, the symptoms. Heat and lid massage can restore oil flow. Courses of systemic tetracycline may be beneficial in more advanced cases and are in any case used in the treatment of acne rosacea which may be an associated condition.

\section*{Case 20}

A 30-year-old man developed an acute red eye first on the right and then in the left eye, associated with a watery discharge. Vision is unaffected but the eye irritates. He is otherwise fit and well.

\section*{Questions}
- What is the diagnosis?
- What confirmatory signs would you look for on examination?
- What precautions would you take following your examination?

\section*{Answers}

The patient has viral conjunctivitis - probably adenovirus - (see Chapter 7). Examination for a preauricular lymph node and conjunctival follicles on the lower tarsus would confirm the diagnosis. This form of conjunctivitis is highly contagious; it is important to ensure that hands and equipment are thoroughly cleaned following the examination, and that the importance of good hygiene is emphasized to the patient.
