                        <p>Inflammation of the uveal tract (the iris, ciliary body and choroid) has many causes and is termed uveitis (Figure 9.1). It is usual for structures adjacent to the inflamed uveal tissue to become involved in the inflammatory process. It may be classified anatomically:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inflammation of the iris, accompanied by increased vascular permeability, is termed <strong>iritis</strong> or <strong>anterior uveitis</strong> (Figure 9.2). White cells circulating in the aqueous humour of the anterior chamber can be seen with a slit lamp. Protein, which also leaks into the anterior chamber from the blood vessels, is picked out by its light-scattering properties in the beam of the slit lamp as a ‘flare’.</li>
                            <li>An inflammation of the ciliary body is termed <strong>cyclitis</strong>, of the pars plana is <strong>pars planitis</strong> and of the vitreous is <strong>vitritis</strong>. As a group these are termed <strong>intermediate uveitis</strong>.</li>
                            <li>Inflammation of the posterior uvea is termed <strong>posterior uveitis</strong> and may involve the choroid (<strong>choroiditis</strong>), the retina (<strong>retinitis</strong>) or both (<strong>chorioretinitis</strong>).</li>
                            <li>A <strong>panuveitis</strong> is present when inflammatory changes affect the anterior chamber, vitreous and retina and/or the choroid.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The patient may complain of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ocular pain (less frequent with posterior uveitis or choroiditis);</li>
                            <li>photophobia;</li>
                            <li>blurring of vision;</li>

                        <p>Posterior uveitis may, however, not be painful.</p>
                        <p>The patient must be questioned about other relevant symptoms that may help determine whether or not there is an associated systemic disease:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Respiratory symptoms</strong> such as shortness of breath, cough, and the nature of any sputum produced (associated sarcoidosis or tuberculosis).</li>
                            <li><strong>Skin problems.</strong> Erythema nodosum (painful raised red lesions on the arms and shins) may be present in granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis and Behçet’s disease. Patients with Behçet’s may also have thrombophlebitis, dermatographia and oral and genital ulceration. Psoriasis (in association with arthritis) may be accompanied by uveitis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Joint disease.</strong> Ankylosing spondylitis with back pain is associated with acute anterior uveitis. In children juvenile chronic arthritis may be associated with uveitis. Reiter’s disease (classically urethritis, conjunctivitis and a seronegative arthritis) may also be associated with anterior uveitis.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><strong>Infectious disease.</strong> Syphilis with its protean manifestations can cause uveitis (particularly posterior choroiditis). Herpetic disease (herpes simplex and zoster) may also cause uveitis. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) may cause uveitis, particularly in patients with AIDS.

                        <p>These are aimed at determining a systemic association and are directed in part by the type of uveitis present. An anterior uveitis is more likely to be associated with ankylosing spondylitis, and human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typing may help confirm the diagnosis. The presence of large KPs and possibly nodules on the iris may suggest sarcoidosis: a chest radiograph, serum calcium and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels would be appropriate. In toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis the focus of inflammation often occurs at the margin of an old inflammatory choroidal scar. A posterior uveitis may have an infectious or systemic inflammatory cause. Some diseases such as CMV infections in HIV-positive patients have a characteristic appearance, and with an appropriate history may require no further diagnostic tests. Associated symptoms may also point towards a systemic disease (e.g. fever, diarrhoea, weight loss). Not all cases of anterior uveitis require investigation at first presentation unless associated systemic symptoms are present.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This is aimed at:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>suppressing inflammation in the eye, and relieving pain in anterior uveitis;</li>
                            <li>preventing damage to ocular structures, particularly to the macula and the optic nerve, which may lead to permanent visual loss.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Steroid therapy is the mainstay of treatment. In anterior uveitis this is delivered by eye drops. However, topical steroids do not effectively penetrate to the posterior segment. Posterior uveitis is therefore treated with systemic steroids, or with steroids injected onto the orbital floor or into the sub-Tenon’s space (Figure 9.4).</p>
                        <p>In anterior uveitis, dilating the pupil relieves the pain from ciliary spasm and prevents the formation of posterior synechiae by separating it from the anterior lens capsule. Synechiae otherwise interfere with normal dilation of the pupil. Dilation is achieved with mydriatics, e.g. cyclopentolate or atropine drops. Atropine has a prolonged action lasting weeks. An attempt to break any synechiae that have formed should be made with initial intensive cyclopentolate and phenylephrine drops. A subconjunctival injection of mydriatics may help to break resistant synechiae.</p>
                        <p>In posterior uveitis/retinitis visual loss may occur either from destructive processes caused by the retinitis itself (e.g. in toxoplasmosis or CMV infection) or from fluid accumulation in the layers of the macula (macular oedema). Apart from systemic or injected steroids, specific antiviral or antibiotic medication may also be required. Some rare but severe forms of uveitis, e.g. that associated with Behçet’s disease, may require treatment with other systemic immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine or ciclosporin. Long-term treatment may be necessary.</p>

                        <p>This is a seronegative (rheumatoid factor negative) spondyloarthropathy causing inflammation of the tendons, ligaments and joints of the spine. Untreated, the condition leads to a disabling, gross rigidity and flexion deformity of the spine. Genetic factors are involved in the disease. Ninety per cent of patients with uveitis have the tissue type HLA B27, although the prevalence of the disease in people in general with HLA B27 is only 1%. Approximately 20% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis will develop acute anterior uveitis. Males are affected more frequently than females (3:1).</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">History</h4>
                        <p>Recurrent anterior uveitis may be the presenting feature of this condition. Close enquiry will usually reveal an insidious history of low backache, typically worse on waking and relieved by exercise. Stiffness at rest is a useful symptom which helps differentiate the condition from disease of the intervertebral discs. The peripheral joints may be affected in a minority of patients.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Signs</h4>
                        <p>These are typical of an anterior uveitis.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Investigation</h4>
                        <p>The presence of symptoms and signs in an HLA B27-positive individual is indicative. Sacroiliac spinal MRI may detect early changes in the sacroiliac joints and radiographs may reveal the classical features of the disease (Figure 9.5).</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                        <p>Treatment of the arthropathy is with painkillers, disease modifying drugs, NSAIDs, physiotherapy and biologics such as etanercept and adalimumab which are directed against the action of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Ocular treatment is as previously outlined. The patient will benefit from a rheumatological opinion and may require intermittent anti-inflammatory treatment and physiotherapy.</p>

                        <p>A seronegative arthritis (negative for rheumatoid factor) which presents in children, either as a systemic disease with fevers and lymphadenopathy, or as a pauciarticular or polyarticular arthritis. The pauciarticular form has the higher risk of chronic anterior uveitis, particularly if the patient is positive for antinuclear antibodies.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">History</h4>
                        <p>The anterior uveitis is chronic and usually asymptomatic. A profound visual defect may be discovered by chance if lens or retinal damage caused by chronic uveitis has developed slowly.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Signs</h4>
                        <p>The eye is white (unusual for iritis), but other signs of an anterior uveitis are present. Because the uveitis is chronic, cataract may occur and patients may develop glaucoma, either as a result of the uveitis or as a result of the steroid drops used to treat the condition. Macular oedema may also occur. Approximately 70% of cases show bilateral involvement.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Investigation</h4>
                        <p>Rheumatoid factor is negative but patients frequently have a positive antinuclear antibody.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                        <p>Ocular treatment is as previously outlined. Patients may be put on systemic treatment for the joint disease. It is important to screen children with juvenile arthritis regularly for uveitis, as they are otherwise asymptomatic unless potentially blinding complications occur. Glaucoma can be very difficult to treat, and, if medical treatment fails to control pressure, it may require surgery.</p>

                        <p>This is a rare chronic uveitis usually found in young adults. The cause is uncertain, it may be immune mediated and there are no systemic associations.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">History</h4>
                        <p>The patient does not usually present with a typical history of iritis. Blurred vision and floaters may be the initial complaint.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Signs</h4>
                        <p>A mild anterior uveitis is present, but without signs of conjunctival inflammation, and there are no posterior synechiae. There are KPs distributed diffusely over the cornea. The iris is heterochromic due to loss of some of the pigment epithelial cells. The vitreous may be inflamed and condensations (the cause of the floaters) may be present. About 70% of patients develop cataract. Glaucoma occurs to a lesser extent.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                        <p>Steroids are not effective in controlling the inflammation and are thus not prescribed. Patients usually respond well to cataract surgery when it is required. The glaucoma is treated conventionally.</p>

                        <p>The infection may be congenital or acquired. Most ocular toxoplasmosis was thought to be congenital, with the resulting retinochoroiditis being reactivated in adult life. However, there is now evidence that it is often acquired during a glandular fever-like illness. The patient may complain of hazy vision and floaters, and the eye may be red and painful.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Signs</h4>
                        <p>The retina is the principal structure involved, with secondary inflammation occurring in the choroid (retinochoroiditis). An active lesion is often located at the posterior pole, appearing as a creamy focus of inflammatory cells at the margin of an old chorioretinal scar (such scars are usually atrophic, with a pigmented edge) (Figure 9.6). Inflammatory cells cause a vitreous haze, and the anterior chamber may also show evidence of inflammation.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Investigation</h4>
                        <p>The clinical appearance is usually diagnostic, but a positive anti-toxoplasma antibody test is suggestive. However, a high percentage of the population have positive IgG titres due to prior infection.</p>

                        <p>Reactivated lesions will subside, but treatment is required if the macula or optic nerve is threatened or if the inflammatory response is very severe. Systemic steroids are administered with antiprotozoal drugs such as clindamycin and sulphadiazine, sometimes used in combination. Patients taking clindamycin must be warned that if diarrhoea develops they should seek medical help immediately as this may indicate the development of pseudomembranous colitis, a side effect of the drug.</p>

                        <p>Behçet’s disease is a condition that causes wide-ranging symptoms including mouth ulcers, genital ulcers and a hypopyon anterior uveitis. Additional central nervous system (CNS), genito-urinary, gastrointestinal (GI) and skin problems and thrombosis also occur. The disease is due to an arteritis of the small blood vessels. The protean nature of the disease may require the support of several different specialists. As it is most common in Mediterranean countries, Turkey, the Middle East, Japan and south-east Asia it has sometimes been called the Silk Route disease, after the ancient trade routes that ran through these areas.</p>

                        <p>Immunosuppressives are the usual treatment for moderate to severe Behçet’s syndrome, e.g. azathioprine, and also ciclosporin, tacrolimus and mycophenolate.

                        <p>Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH) is a multisystem disorder presenting with a bilateral panuveitis with exudative retinal detachments and followed by neurological and cutaneous manifestations such as baldness and loss of lash and skin pigments (poliosis and vitiligo). It is a cell-mediated autoimmune disease probably directed against tyrosinase-related proteins, TRP1 and TRP2 contained in melanocytes. VKH is more common in females than males (2:1) and affects individuals aged 20–50 years, although it has been reported in children as young as 4 years. VKH disease occurs most commonly in patients with a genetic predisposition to the disease, including Asian, Middle Eastern, Hispanic, and Native American populations. Several HLA associations have been found in patients with VKH disease, including HLA-DR4, HLA-DR53 and HLA-DQ4.</p>
                        <p>A prodromal stage, with fever, headache, tinnitus and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, is followed after several days by a posterior uveitis leading to bilateral serous detachments. There is also a vigorous granulomatous, anterior uveitis with mutton fat KP. After several weeks the detachments subside and there is both depigmentation of the choroid and hyperpigmentation of the retina. Skin changes include vitiligo and poliosis of the lashes, eyebrows and hair, with the vitiligo distributed symmetrically over the head, eyelids and trunk.</p>

                        <p>This is a devastating complication of ocular injury. A penetrating or surgical injury to one eye involving the retina may rarely excite a peculiar form of uveitis which involves not only the injured eye but also the fellow eye. This is termed sympathetic ophthalmitis. The uveitis may be so severe that in the worst cases sight may be lost from both eyes. Fortunately systemic steroids, and particularly ciclosporin, have greatly improved the chances of conserving vision. Sympathetic ophthalmitis usually develops within 3 months of the injury or last ocular operation but may occur at any time. The cause appears to be an immune response against retinal antigens at the time of injury. It can be prevented by enucleation (removal) of the traumatized eye shortly after the injury (within a week or so) if the prospects for visual potential in that eye are very poor and there is major disorganization. Excision must precede the onset of signs in the fellow eye.</p>

                        <p>The iris appears swollen, and yellow-white spots may be seen on the retina. There is a panuveitis.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                        <p>High-dose systemic and topical steroids, and also oral ciclosporin, are required to reduce the inflammation and to prevent long-term visual loss. It is vital to warn patients with ocular trauma or multiple eye operations to attend an eye casualty department if they experience any problems with their normal eye.</p>
