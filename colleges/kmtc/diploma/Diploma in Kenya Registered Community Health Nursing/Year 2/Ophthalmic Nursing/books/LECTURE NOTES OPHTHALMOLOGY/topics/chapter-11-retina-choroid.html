                        <p>The retina is subject to an enormous range of disease, both inherited and acquired. Some are common, with significant socioeconomic importance (e.g. age-related macular degeneration), while others are much rarer (for example some of the macular dystrophies). The impact on the individual may be profound in either case. Diseases of the macula, particularly if bilateral, result in a profound reduction in visual acuity. Despite the variety of diseases, the symptoms are relatively stereotyped. These will be described first. In this chapter both hereditary and acquired disease of the vitreous, neuroretina, retinal pigment epithelium and choroid will be described. In the chapter which follows the effects of disorders of the retinal circulation will be explored.</p>

                        <p>The central part of the macula (the fovea) is responsible for fine resolution. Disorders of this relatively small part of the retina cause significant visual impairment. The patient may complain of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Blurred central vision.</li>
                            <li>Distorted vision (metamorphopsia) caused by a disturbance in the arrangement of the photoreceptors such as that which occurs in macular oedema. A reduction (micropsia) or enlargement (macropsia) of object size may also occur if the photoreceptors become stretched apart or compressed together.</li>
                            <li>The patient may notice areas of loss of the central visual field (scotomata) if part of the photoreceptor layer becomes covered, e.g. by blood, or if the photoreceptors are destroyed.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The patient complains of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Loss of visual field (usually detected clinically when a significant amount of the peripheral retina is damaged). Small areas of damage, e.g. small haemorrhages, do not produce clinically detectable defects. The field loss may be absolute, for example in a branch retinal artery occlusion, or relative (i.e. brighter or larger objects are visible) as in a retinal detachment.</li>
                            <li>Some diseases affecting the retina may predominantly affect one type of photoreceptor; in retinitis pigmentosa the rods are principally affected so that night vision is reduced (night blindness).</li>

                    <h2 id="acquired-macular-disease-heading" class="section-heading">Acquired macular disease</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Acquired disease at the macula may destroy part or all of the thickness of the retina (e.g. age-related macular degeneration or a macular hole). In a number of conditions this damage is dramatically magnified by the growth of new vessels from the choroid through Bruch’s membrane and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), causing haemorrhage or exudation of fluid into the subretinal space and subsequent scarring of the retina. The neuroretina ceases to function if it is detached from the RPE, so these changes cause marked disruption of macular function even before direct retinal damage occurs.</p>
                        <p>Fluid may also accumulate within the layers of the retina at the macula (cystoid macular oedema) if the normal tight junctions of the retinal capillaries that form the inner blood-retinal barrier break down. This may occur following intraocular surgery, such as cataract surgery. The retina and sub-retinal layers may also become separated by diffusion of fluid from the choriocapillaris through an abnormal region of the retinal pigment epithelium. This represents a breakdown of the outer blood-retinal barrier between the choroid and the retina, and is termed central serous retinopathy. It may occur unilaterally, as a potentially reversible disorder particularly in young men.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="amd" class="subsection-heading">Age-related macular degeneration</h3>
                        <p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the commonest cause of irreversible visual loss in the developed world (Figure 11.1).</p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pathogenesis</h4>
                        <p>The RPE removes and processes the used discs of the photoreceptor outer segments. Over time, undigested lipid products, such as the age pigment lipofuscin, accumulate in the RPE and the excess material is transferred to Bruch’s membrane, impairing its diffusional properties. Extracellular deposits form between the RPE and Bruch’s membrane which can be seen with the ophthalmoscope as discrete, sub-retinal yellow lesions called drüsen. Collections of these drüsen in the macula give rise to the condition termed age-related maculopathy or ARM where vision is normal. The neighbouring RPE and photoreceptors may also show degenerative changes, producing the dry or non-exudative form of AMD. In the less common, exudative or ‘wet’ form, new vessels from the choroid, stimulated by angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), grow through Bruch’s membrane and the RPE into the sub-retinal space, where they form a sub-retinal neovascular membrane. Subsequent haemorrhage into the sub-retinal space or even through the retina into the vitreous is associated with profound visual loss.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Symptoms</h4>
                        <p>The symptoms are those of macular dysfunction outlined above.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Signs</h4>
                        <p>The usual foveal reflex is absent. Yellow, well circumscribed drüsen may be seen, and there may be areas of hypo- and hyperpigmentation. In exudative AMD sub-retinal, or more occasionally pre-retinal, haemorrhages may be seen. The experienced observer may detect elevation of the retina stereoscopically.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Investigation</h4>
                        <p>Diagnosis is based on the appearance of the retina. In patients with a suspected exudative AMD and with vision that is not severely affected, a fluorescein angiogram is performed to delineate the position of the sub-retinal neovascular membrane. The position of the membrane determines whether or not the patient may benefit from laser treatment.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                        <p>There is no treatment for non-exudative AMD. Patients with visual loss in one eye (visual loss t<6/24 from non-exudative or exudative disease) and high risk features in the fellow eye or bilateral high risk features but normal vision (large or confluent drüsen or significant hypo- and hyperpigmentation) may benefit from high-dose antioxidant vitamins and zinc. Betacarotene is, however, avoided in smokers or those who have recently stopped smoking because of the increased risk of lung cancer. Smoking itself is associated with an increased risk of developing haemorrhagic, exudative AMD and patients should be encouraged to stop.</p>
                        <p>Vision is maximized with low-vision aids including magnifiers and telescopes and closed-circuit television devices (CCTV). The patient must be reassured that although central vision has been lost, the disease will not spread to affect the peripheral vision. Therefore navigational vision is retained. This is a vital message, since many patients fear that they will become totally blind.</p>
                        <p>Patients with exudative AMD, where the fluorescein angiogram reveals a subretinal vascular membrane can be treated with drugs inhibiting the action of angiogenic factors such as VEGF. These drugs retard angiogenesis and cause regression of existing new vessels. Anti-VEGF agents are currently given by repeated injections into the vitreous cavity. They reduce visual loss and restore the normal anatomical appearance of the macula. In some patients vision may improve. This treatment represents a major advance in the therapy of this disease.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="other-degenerative-conditions" class="subsection-heading">Other degenerative conditions associated with the formation of sub-retinal neovascular membranes</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Degenerative changes and sub-retinal neovascular membranes may also occur at the maculae of very myopic patients and can cause loss of central vision, particularly in young adulthood.</li>
                            <li>Sub-retinal neovascular membranes may also grow through elongated cracks in Bruch’s membrane called angioid streaks (Figure 11.2). These are seen classically in the rare recessive disorder pseudoxanthoma elasticum, and uncommonly in systemic diseases such as Paget’s disease and sickle cell disease. Again there may be a profound reduction in central vision. Vision is also reduced if the crack itself passes through the fovea.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-184-1.jpg" alt="Figure 11.2 Fundus photograph showing the clinical appearance of angioid streaks in pseudoxanthoma elasticum.

                        <h3 id="macular-holes-membranes" class="subsection-heading">Macular holes and membranes</h3>
                        <p>A well circumscribed hole may form at the centre of the macular region and destroy the fovea, resulting in a major loss of acuity (Figure 11.3). It results from vitreous traction on the thin macular retina. The early stages of hole formation may be associated with visual distortion and mild blurring of vision.</p>
                        <p>Unlike peripheral retinal holes, macular holes are not usually associated with retinal detachment. Most are idiopathic in origin, but they may be associated with blunt trauma. Much interest is being shown in the treatment of macular holes with vitreous surgery to relieve the traction on the retina. The degree of visual improvement depends on the initial vision, the duration of symptoms and the stage (severity) of the macular hole. No other treatment is available.</p>
                        <p>A pre-retinal glial membrane may form over the macular region, whose contraction causes puckering of the retina and again results in blurred and distorted of vision. These symptoms may be improved by removing the membrane with microsurgical vitrectomy techniques.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-185-1.jpg" alt="Figure 11.3 (a) Fundus appearance of a macular hole. (b) An OCT scan showing a full-thickness macular hole. (c) A normal OCT scan for comparison." class="content-image">

                        <h3 id="central-serous-retinopathy" class="subsection-heading">Central serous retinopathy</h3>
                        <p>Here, a localized accumulation of fluid between the neuro retina and the RPE separates the two layers and disturbs the photoreceptor layer. It results from a localized breakdown in the normal barrier function of the RPE. It is usually unilateral and typically affects young or middle-aged males. Patients complain of distortion and blurred vision and visual acuity may fall markedly. Examination reveals a dome-shaped elevation of the retina (Figure 11.4).</p>
                        <p>Treatment is not usually required, as the condition is self-limiting. Occasionally, in intractable cases or those where the vision is severely affected, the argon laser can be used to seal the point of leakage identified with a fluorescein angiogram.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-186-1.jpg" alt="Figure 11.4 Diagram illustrating the pattern of fluid accumulation in central serous retinopathy, showing a localized detachment of the neurosensory retina from the RPE." class="content-image">

                        <h3 id="macular-oedema" class="subsection-heading">Macular oedema</h3>
                        <p>This extracellular accumulation of fluid within the retina is a further cause of distorted and blurred vision (Figure 11.5). Ophthalmoscopy reveals a loss of the normal foveal reflex and with experience a rather cystic appearance to the fovea. If the diagnosis is in doubt a confirmatory optical coherence tomogram (OCT) scan (Figure 11.5) or a fluorescein angiogram can be performed. The fluorescein leaks into the oedematous retina in a characteristic pattern (see Chapter 2).</p>
                        <p>Macular oedema may be associated with numerous and diverse eye disorders, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>intraocular surgery;</li>
                            <li>uveitis;</li>
                            <li>retinal vascular disease (e.g. diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion);</li>
                            <li>retinitis pigmentosa.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Treatment can be difficult and is dependent on the associated eye disease. Steroids in high doses are helpful in macular oedema caused by uveitis; acetazolamide may be helpful in treating patients with retinitis pigmentosa or following intraocular surgery.</p>

                        <h3 id="toxic-maculopathies" class="subsection-heading">Toxic maculopathies</h3>
                        <p>The accumulation of some drugs in the RPE can cause macular damage. These include the antimalarials chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, used quite widely in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other connective-tissue disorders, which may cause a toxic maculopathy. Chloroquine is the more toxic. Patients on chloroquine require regular visual assessment for maculopathy (Figure 11.6). The maculopathy is initially only detected by accurate assessment of macular function. At this early stage, discontinuation of the drug reverses the maculopathy. Later, a pigmentary target lesion is seen ophthalmoscopically, associated with metamorphopsia and an appreciable and irreversible loss of central vision. Ocular toxicity is unlikely with a dose of less than 4 mg (chloroquine phosphate) per kg lean body weight per day or a total cumulative dose of less than 300 g. Screening of patients on hydroxychloroquine, at the recommended dose, although still advised, is questioned by some.</p>

                        <p>With ageing, the vitreous gel undergoes degenerative changes over the age of 60 (earlier in myopes), with liquefaction and the formation of fragments of condensed vitreous. They cast shadows on the retina, giving rise to the common symptom of vitreous ‘floaters’. These take the form of spots or cobwebs which obscure vision only slightly and move when the eyes move, reflecting the fluid nature of the vitreous. Symptoms are most marked on bright days, when the small pupil throws a sharper image on the retina.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes, in older patients or myopes, the vitreous gel collapses and separates from points of retinal attachment, a condition termed a posterior vitreous detachment (Figure 11.7). This gives rise to acute symptoms of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>photopsia</strong> (flashing lights) – due to traction on the peripheral retina by the detaching vitreous;</li>
                            <li>a <strong>shower of floaters</strong> – representing condensations within the collapsed vitreous, or sometimes a vitreous haemorrhage caused when the detaching vitreous ruptures a small blood vessel during the formation of a retinal tear or hole.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For this reason presentation with recent symptoms of an acute vitreous detachment is an indication for full assessment of the vitreous and peripheral retina with full pupil dilation.</p>
