\section*{Introduction}

Eye movements may be abnormal because there is:
- an abnormal position of the eyes;
- a reduced range of eye movements;
- an abnormality in the character of the eye movements.

\section*{Anatomy and physiology}

Each eye can be abducted (away from the nose) or adducted (towards the nose) or may look up (elevation) or down (depression). The cardinal positions of gaze for assessing a muscle palsy are: gaze right and left, up, down, and gaze up to the right and left and down to the right and left.

Six extraocular muscles control eye movement. The medial recti bring about horizontal adduction of the eyes and the lateral recti cause horizontal abduction. The superior and inferior recti elevate and depress the eye in abduction. The superior oblique causes depression of the eye in the adducted position and the inferior oblique causes elevation in the adducted position. The vertical muscles each have secondary, rotatory actions (intorsion and extorsion).

Three cranial nerves supply these muscles (see Chapter 1) and their nuclei are found in the brainstem, together with pathways linking them with other brainstem nuclei (e.g. vestibular) and with gaze centres (horizontal gaze in the pons and vertical gaze in the midbrain). These provide supranuclear pathways which coordinate the movements of both eyes.

Higher cortical centres control the speed with which the eyes follow a moving target (smooth pursuit), and the rapid movements required to take up a new position of gaze (saccades). These centres also influence the brainstem nuclei.

The linkage of the nuclei ensures that the eyes move together in a coordinated fashion (Figure 15.1). For example, when looking to the right, the right lateral and left medial rectus are equally stimulated and act as yoke muscles. At the same time innervation of the antagonists which move the eyes to the left (the left lateral rectus and the right medial rectus) is inhibited.

Clinically, eye movement disorders are best described under four headings (which are not mutually exclusive):

1 In a non-paralytic squint the movements of both eyes are full (there is no paresis) but only one eye is directed towards the fixated target (Figure 15.2). The angle of deviation is constant and unrelated to the direction of gaze. This is also termed a concomitant squint and is the common squint seen in childhood.
2 In a paralytic squint there is underaction of one or more of the eye muscles due to a nerve palsy, extraocular muscle disease or tethering of the globe. The size of the squint is dependent on the direction of gaze and thus, for a nerve palsy, is greatest in the field of action of the affected muscle (i.e. the direction in which the muscle would normally take the globe) (Figure 15.3). This is also termed an incomitant squint.
3 In gaze palsies there is a disturbance of the supranuclear coordination of eye movements. Pursuit and saccadic eye movements may also be affected if the cortical pathways to the nuclei controlling eye movements are interrupted.
4 Disorders of the brainstem nuclei or vestibular input may also result in a form of oscillating eye movement termed nystagmus.

\section*{Non-paralytic squint}

\section*{Binocular single vision}

In the absence of a squint (strabismus), both eyes are directed towards the same object of regard. Their movements are coordinated so that the retinal images of an object fall on corresponding points of each retina. These images are fused centrally, so that they are interpreted by the brain as a single image. This is termed binocular single vision (Figure 15.4). Because each eye views an object from a different angle, the retinal images do not fall precisely on corresponding points of each retina. This disparity permits a three-dimensional percept to be constructed. This is termed stereopsis. The development of stereopsis requires that eye movements and visual alignment are coordinated over approximately the first 5 years of life.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 15.4 Elimination of the blind spot and increase in the field of vision that binocular single vision affords.}
\end{figure}

Binocular single vision and stereopsis afford certain advantages to the individual:
- They increase the field of vision.
- They eliminate the blind spot, since the blind spot of one eye falls in the seeing field of the other.
- They provide a binocular acuity, which is greater than monocular acuity.
- Stereopsis provides depth perception and estimation of distance.

If the visual axes of the two eyes are not aligned, binocular single vision is not possible. This results in:
- Diplopia. An object is seen to be in two different places.
- Visual confusion. Two separate and different objects appear to be at the same point.

In children, a non-alignment of the visual axes of the two eyes (or squint) results in suppression of the image in the squinting eye. This means that when the vision in the two eyes is tested together only one object is seen and there is no diplopia. If this is prolonged and constant during the sensitive period of visual development (the first 5 years) it causes a reduced visual acuity in the squinting eye (strabismic amblyopia). Amblyopia will only develop if the squint constantly affects the same eye. Some children alternate the squinting eye and do not develop amblyopia, since a focused image always falls on one or other retina. However, they do not develop stereopsis.

\section*{Aetiology of non-paralytic squint}

Non-paralytic squint:
1 May develop in an otherwise normal child with normal eyes. The cause of the problem in these patients remains obscure. It is thought to be caused by an abnormality in the central coordination of eye movements.
2 May be associated with refractive error or ocular disease:
a A refractive error which prevents the formation of a clear image on the retina. This is the most common factor. If the refractive error is dissimilar in the two eyes (anisometropia) one retinal image will be blurred.
b In a child with an equal degree of long sight (hypermetropia) in both eyes a convergent squint may develop because of the increased accommodative effort required to focus on both distant, and particularly near, objects. The link (synkinesis) between the accommodative and convergence mechanisms leads to an excessive convergence and ultimately to a convergent squint of one eye. Where the squint only occurs on attempted focusing on near objects (an accommodative squint), amblyopia does not develop since binocular visual alignment remains normal for part of the time, during distant viewing.
c Opacities in the media of the eye blurring or preventing the formation of the retinal image (i.e. corneal opacities or cataract).
d Abnormalities of the retina. Although a correctly formed image is formed, inadequate information is transmitted to the visual cortex.

\section*{History}

The presence of a squint in a child may be noted by the parents or detected at preschool or school screening clinics. It may be intermittent or constant. There may be a family history of squint or refractive error. The following should be noted:
- When the squint is present - i.e. is it constant?
- How long a squint has been present.
- Past medical, birth and family history of the child.

\section*{Examination}

First the patient is observed for features that may simulate a squint. These include:
- epicanthus (a crescentic fold of skin on the side of the nose that incompletely covers the inner canthus) (Figure 15.5); This simulates convergent squint.
- facial asymmetry.

Then the alignment of the two eyes is tested, using a pen torch. The corneal reflection of a torch light, held 33 cm in front of the subject, is a guide to eye position. If the child is squinting the reflection will be central in the fixating eye and deviated in the squinting eye (Figure 15.6).

A cover/uncover test (Figure 15.7) is next performed to detect a manifest squint (a tropia):
- The right eye is completely covered for a few seconds whilst holding a detailed near target, such as a toy, in front of the child as a fixation target. The left eye is closely observed. If it has been maintaining fixation it should not move. If it moves outwards to take up fixation an esotropia or convergent squint is

\begin{figure}

present. If it moves inwards to take up fixation an exotropia or divergent squint is present.
- The cover is removed from the right eye and then the left eye covered, this time closely observing the right. If it moves outwards to take up fixation an esotropia is present. If it moves inwards to take up fixation an exotropia is present. If there is no movement no squint is present.
- The test is repeated for a distant object sited at 6 m and for a far-distant object. It will also reveal a vertical squint.

\begin{figure}

The squinting right eye moves outwards to take up fixation, and the non-squinting eye moves inwards because the movement of the two eyes is linked. (d) The cover is removed from the left eye, which moves outwards to take up fixation; the right eye moves inward to resume its squinting position. (If an alternating squint was present (i.e. each eye retained the ability to fixate) the right eye would maintain fixation and the eyes would not move when the cover was removed.)}
\end{figure}

\section*{Investigating a squint}

Summary of the steps taken in investigating a squinting child:
- Determination of acuity (see Chapter 2).
- Detection of any abnormality in eye movement.
- Detection and measurement of the squint.
- Measurement of stereopsis.
- Determination of any refractive error.
- Careful examination of the eyes, including a dilated fundus view.

If no abnormal eye movement is seen an alternate cover test is performed. This will reveal the presence of a latent squint (a phoria), which occurs only when the two eyes are not simultaneously stimulated, that is in the absence of bifoveal visual stimulation. It is not really an abnormal condition, and can be demonstrated in most people who otherwise have normal binocular single vision. It represent a tendency of the visual pathways to drift apart which is corrected by unconscious effort. If this effort fails, for instance during fatigue, then a manifest non-paralytic squint, accompanied by diplopia, may occur. The effort of maintaining binocular vision by adjusting for the heterophoria may at times itself be a source of symptoms.

The alternate cover test is performed as follows:
- This time the cover is moved rapidly from one eye to the other a couple of times. This dissociates the eyes (i.e. there is no longer bifoveal stimulation), causing a squint to become manifest.
- The right eye is now occluded and then uncovered. As the occluder is removed any movement in the right eye is noted. If the eye has moved inwards to take up fixation and resume binocularity, then an exophoria (latent divergence) is present. If the eye moves outwards to take up fixation then an esophoria (latent convergence) is present. Exactly the same movements would be seen in the left eye if it were covered following dissociation.

In an eye clinic the squint can be further assessed with the synoptophore (see Chapter 2). This instrument, together with special three-dimensional pictures, can also be used to determine whether the eyes are used together and whether stereopsis is present.

Refractive error is measured following topical administration of cyclopentolate eye drops to paralyse accommodation and dilate the pupil. The eye is then examined to exclude opacities of the cornea, lens or vitreous and abnormalities of the retina or optic disc.

\section*{Treatment}

A non-paralytic squint with no associated ocular disease is treated as follows:
- Any significant refractive error is first corrected with glasses.
- If amblyopia is present and the vision does not improve with glasses the better-seeing eye is patched for limited periods of time to stimulate visual development promote an improvement of visual acuity in the amblyopic eye.
- Surgical intervention to realign the eyes may be required for functional reasons (to restore or establish binocular single vision) or for cosmetic reasons (to improve appearance and prevent a child being singled out at school) (Figure 15.8).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-255.jpg?height=937&width=1049&top_left_y=853&top_left_x=289}

\caption{Figure 15.8 The principles of squint surgery. (a) Recession. The conjunctiva has been incised to expose the medial rectus muscle. The muscle is then disinserted and moved backwards on the globe. (b) Resection.

\end{figure}

The principle of surgery is to realign the eyes by adjusting the position of the muscles on the globe or by shortening the muscle. Access to the muscles is gained by making a small incision in the conjunctiva.
- Moving the muscle insertion backwards on the globe (recession) weakens its action.
- Removing a segment of the muscle at its insertion (resection) strengthens its action.

\section*{Prognosis}

Glasses and patching can significantly improve vision in the squinting eye. Unfortunately realignment, even if performed when the child is very young, is rarely associated with the development of stereopsis in the majority of nonparalytic squints. The operation is important from the cosmetic viewpoint, however, particularly when the child starts school.

\section*{Paralytic squint}

\section*{Isolated nerve palsy}

\section*{Pathogenesis}

Disease of the third, fourth and sixth nerves and their central connections gives rise to a paralytic strabismus (Figure 15.9). Each nerve may be affected at any point along its course from brainstem nucleus to orbit. Table 15.1 details some causes.

\section*{History and examination}

The patient complains of diplopia. There may be an abnormal head posture to compensate for the inability of the eye to move in a particular direction.

A sixth nerve palsy results in failure of abduction of the eye.
A fourth nerve palsy results in defective depression of the eye when attempted in adduction. It produces the least noticeable eye-movement abnormality. Patients may notice vertical double vision with some torsion of the image, particularly when going downstairs or reading.

A third nerve palsy results in:
- failure of adduction, elevation and depression of the eye;
- ptosis;
- in some cases, a dilated pupil due to involvement of the autonomic fibres.

\section*{Treatment}

An isolated nerve palsy is often related to coexistent systemic disease. If a posterior communicating aneurysm is suspected the patient must be sent for

neurosurgical review and angiography. The most common cause of a palsy is microvascular disease of a peripheral cranial nerve, itself associated with diabetes or hypertension. Here, nerve function recovers over some months and the symptoms abate.

Orbital disease (see Chapter 4) and disease in the cavernous sinus may also be the cause of multiple nerve palsies such as the third, fourth and sixth nerves, because they are anatomically close together. A CT or MRI scan will show the lesion (e.g. an orbital metastasis).

Diplopia can be helped by fitting prisms to the patient's glasses, which realign the retinal images. Alternatively the affected eye can be patched. If eye movements fail to improve spontaneously then surgical intervention may be required. Such intervention will seldom restore normal full eye movement but is aimed at restoring an acceptable field of binocular single vision in the primary positions of gaze (i.e. straight ahead and in downgaze), the commonest positions in which the eyes are used.

\section*{Disease of the extraocular muscles}

\section*{Dysthyroid eye disease}

\section*{Pathogenesis}

Disorders of the thyroid gland can be associated with an infiltration of the extraocular muscles with lymphocytes and the deposition of glycosaminoglycans in the tissues, leading to proptosis, exposure of the globes and limitation of eye movements. The condition occurs particularly in hyperthyroidism but also in hyopothyroidism. An immunological process is suspected but not fully determined.

\section*{Symptoms and signs}

The patient may sometimes complain of:
- a red painful eye (associated with exposure caused by proptosis) - if the redness is limited to part of the eye only it may indicate active inflammation in the adjacent muscle;
- double vision;
- reduced visual acuity (sometimes associated with optic neuropathy).

On examination (Figure 15.10a):
- There may be proptosis of the eye (the eye protrudes from the orbit, also termed exophthalmos).
- The conjunctiva may be chemosed and the eye injected over the muscle insertions.
- The upper lid may be retracted so that sclera is visible (due in part to increased sympathetic activity stimulating the sympathetically innervated smooth muscle of levator). This results in a characteristic stare.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-260.jpg?height=404&width=1069&top_left_y=289&top_left_x=230}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 15.10 Dysthyroid eye disease: (a) clinical appearance; (b) a CT scan demonstrating muscle thickening.}
\end{figure}
- The upper lid may lag behind the movement of the globe on downgaze (lid lag).
- There may be restricted eye movements or squint (also termed restrictive thyroid myopathy, exophthalmic ophthalmoplegia, dysthyroid eye disease or Graves' disease).

The inferior rectus is the most commonly affected muscle. Its movement becomes restricted and there is mechanical limitation of the eye in upgaze. Involvement of the medial rectus causes mechanical limitation of abduction, thereby mimicking a sixth nerve palsy. A CT or MRI scan shows enlargement of the rectus muscles (Figure 15.10b).

\section*{Investigations}

These include:
- thyroid function tests;
- anti-thyroid antibodies.

\section*{Complications}

Dysthyroid eye disease is associated with two serious acute complications:
1 Excessive exposure of the conjunctiva and cornea with the formation of chemosis (oedematous swelling of the conjunctiva), and corneal ulcers due to proptosis and failure of the lids to protect the cornea. The condition may lead to corneal perforation.
2 Compressive optic neuropathy due to compression and ischaemia of the optic nerve by the thickened muscles. This leads to field loss and may cause blindness.

\section*{Treatment}

Corneal exposure and optic nerve compression require urgent treatment with systemic steroids, radiotherapy or surgical orbital decompression.

In the long term, treatment may be needed for the eye-movement problems and to improve the cosmetic appearance. A period may elapse while the eye movements stabilize, during which time prisms can be used to manage the diplopia. Once stabilized, if the patient remains symptomatic, surgery on the extraocular muscles can be performed to increase the field of binocular single vision. If desired, cosmetic surgery to lower the upper lids can be undertaken following the squint surgery. This improves the cosmetic appearance and achieves better protection of the cornea.

\section*{Myasthenia gravis}

\section*{Pathogenesis}

Myasthenia gravis is caused by the development of antibodies to the acetylcholine receptors of striated muscle. It affects females more than males and, although commonest in the 15-50 age group, may affect young children and older adults. Some $40 \%$ of patients may show involvement of the extraocular muscles only.

\section*{Symptoms and signs}

The extraocular muscles fatigue, resulting in a variable diplopia. A variable ptosis may also be present. See Chapter 5 for a full account of diagnostic tests.

\section*{Treatment}

The diagnosis can be confirmed by electromyography or by determining whether an injection of neostigmine or edrophonium (cholinesterase antagonists) temporarily restores normal muscle movement. This test must be performed under close medical supervision with resuscitation equipment and atropine to hand because of the possibility of cholinergic side effects such as bradycardia and bronchospasm.

Patients are treated, in collaboration with a neurologist, with neostigmine or pyridostigmine. Systemic steroids and surgical removal of the thymus also have a role in treatment.

\section*{Ocular myositis}

This is an inflammation of the extraocular muscles associated with pain and diplopia, leading to a restriction in the movement of the involved muscle (similar to that seen in dysthyroid eye disease). It is not usually associated with systemic disease, but thyroid abnormalities should be excluded. The conjunctiva over the involved muscle is inflamed. CT or MRI scanning shows a
thickening of the muscle. If symptoms are troublesome it responds to a short course of steroids.

\section*{Ocular myopathy}

Ocular myopathy (progressive external ophthalmoplegia) is a rare condition where the movement of the eyes is slowly and symmetrically reduced. It is caused by a mitochondrial DNA mutation in the muscle. There is an associated ptosis. Ultimately, eye movement may be lost completely.

\section*{Brown's syndrome}

In this condition, elevation of the eye in adduction during contraction of the ipsilateral inferior oblique muscle is restricted by the superior oblique muscle tendon failing to pass smoothly through its trochlear pulley or a stiff inelastic tendon-muscle complex (Brown's syndrome). The exact cause remains unknown. The condition may be congenital or result from trauma to the orbit.

\section*{Duane's syndrome}

This is a 'congenital miswiring' or faulty innervation of the medial and lateral rectus muscles. Cases of an absent sixth nerve and nucleus are also reported. There is neuromuscular activity in the lateral rectus during adduction and reduced lateral rectus activity in abduction. This results in limited abduction and narrowing of the palpebral aperture on adduction with retraction of the eye into the globe (due to simultaneous contraction of medial and lateral rectus muscles). The condition may be unilateral or, more rarely, bilateral. Children do not usually develop amblyopia, because binocular alignment is normal in some positions of gaze. Surgical intervention is often not required.

\section*{Gaze palsies}

Gaze palsies affect the movement of the two eyes acting in concert. Disordered eye movement results from damage to the pathways connecting the cranial nerve nuclei together and to the higher centres. The abnormality in eye movement depends on the point at which the pathway is disrupted. Both the extent and form of eye movement may be affected. Some of the more common are briefly described below. The ophthalmologist usually investigates and manages these patients with the help of a neurologist.

\section*{Lesions of the parapontine reticular formation (PPRF)}

\section*{Pathogenesis}

The PPRF controls the horizontal movements of the eyes. Lesions affecting the PPRF are usually associated with other brainstem disease. It may be seen in patients with:
- vascular disease;
- tumours.

\section*{Symptoms and signs}

There is:
- a failure of horizontal movements of both eyes to the side of the lesion (a horizontal gaze palsy);
- deviation of the eyes to the contralateral side in acute cases.

\section*{Internuclear ophthalmoplegia}

\section*{Pathogenesis}

It is caused by a lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) (Figure 15.11). The MLF connects the sixth nerve nucleus to the third nerve nucleus on the opposite side and coordinates their activity in gaze movements.
It may become damaged in:
- demyelination (e.g. multiple sclerosis - usually bilateral);
- vascular disease (unilateral).

\section*{Symptoms and signs}

The patient complains of horizontal diplopia. There is a:
- reduction of adduction on the same side as the lesion;
- nystagmus of the contralateral, abducting eye.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 15.11 The site of the lesion producing an internuclear ophthalmoplegia.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Management}

Spontaneous recovery is usual although variable in demyelination. An MRI scan may be helpful diagnostically, both to locate the causal brainstem lesion and, in demyelination, to determine whether other plaques are present.

\section*{Parinaud's syndrome (dorsal midbrain syndrome)}

\section*{Pathogenesis}

In Parinaud's syndrome a lesion in the dorsal midbrain involves the centre for vertical gaze. It may be seen in patients with:
- demyelination;
- space-occupying lesions such as a pinealoma which press on the tectum;
- infarction of the dorsal midbrain;
- an enlarged third ventricle.

\section*{Symptoms and signs}

The disorder causes:
- deficient elevation of both eyes;
- convergence of the eyes and retraction into the orbit associated with nystagmus on attempted elevation;
- light-near dissociation of the pupil (the pupil constricts on accommodation but reacts poorly to a light stimulus).

\section*{Abnormal oscillations of the eyes}

\section*{Nystagmus}

This refers to repeated involuntary to and fro or up and down movements of the eyes. Similar movements may occur normally when following a moving object (e.g. looking out of a train window) (optokinetic nystagmus) or following stimulation of the vestibular system. When examined closely they may be seen to have a slow phase in one direction and a fast phase in the other (jerk nystagmus). The nystagmus is described as beating to the side of the fast component. In some cases the speed of eye movement may be roughly the same in either direction (pendular nystagmus). Jerk nystagmus may also be seen at the extreme position of gaze (end-gaze nystagmus).

\section*{Acquired nystagmus}

Pathologically, jerk nystagmus may be seen:
- in cerebellar disease, when it is worse when gaze is directed towards the side of the lesion - the fast phase is directed towards the side of the lesion;
- with some drugs (such as barbiturates);
- in damage to the labyrinth and its central connections, when a fine jerk nystagmus results - the fast phase of the movement is away from the lesion and it is usually present only acutely.

An upbeat nystagmus (fast phase upwards) is commonly associated with brainstem disease. It may also be seen in toxic states, e.g. with excess alcohol intake.
A downbeat nystagmus may be seen in patients with a posterior fossa lesion near the cervicomedullary junction (e.g. a Chiari malformation, where cerebellar tissue is dragged through the foramen magnum). It may also be seen in patients with demyelination, and again may be present in toxic states.

Patients with nerve palsies or weakness of the extraocular muscles may develop nystagmus when looking in the direction of the affected muscle (gazeevoked nystagmus). The fast phase of the movement is in the field of action of the weak muscle.

Patients with acquired nystagmus complain that the visual environment is in continual movement (oscillopsia).

\section*{Congenital nystagmus}

Nystagmus can be congenital in origin.
- Sensory congenital nystagmus. Here the movements may be at similar speeds in both directions (pendular nystagmus) or of the jerk variety. It is associated with poor vision (e.g. congenital cataract, albinism).
- Motor congenital nystagmus is a jerk nystagmus developing at birth in children with no visual defect.

The continuous movement of the eye reduces visual acuity but does not cause oscillopsia in congenital nystagmus. The exact degree of disability depends on:
- the speed of the nystagmus;
- whether there are short periods of rest between the nystagmoid movements when objects can be focused on the fovea;
- whether the nystagmus is reduced by accommodation, as is often the case.

Some subjects find a position of the eyes which reduces the nystagmus to a minimum (the null position), thus maximizing visual acuity.

\section*{KEY POINTS}
- In analysing eye movement problems try to determine whether there is an abnormal position of the eyes, a reduction in the range of eye movements, an abnormality in the form of eye movements, or a combination of these disorders.
- An abnormality in the range of eye movements may reflect muscular, orbital, infranuclear or supranuclear disease.
- An intracranial aneurysm may present as a painful third nerve palsy involving the pupil.

\section*{PAEDIATRIC OPHTHALMOLOGY}
- In a child with a squint it is important to exclude intraocular pathology.
