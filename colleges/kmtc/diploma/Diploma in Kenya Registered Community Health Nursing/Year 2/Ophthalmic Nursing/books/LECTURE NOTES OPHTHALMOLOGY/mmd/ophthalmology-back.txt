4. A 45-year-old man attended his GP with a frontal headache and reduced vision in his left eye. The GP confirmed that the vision was reduced and noted that although the pupils were equal, when a light was moved from the right to the left eye both pupils appeared to dilate. The optic nerve on the left appeared pale, that on the right was normal.
5. A child suspected of having a squint had been taken to the eye hospital one afternoon. The following morning his mother phoned the GP saying that his pupils were dilated.

\section*{Answers to EMQs}
1.1 f The most likely cause in this age group is acute angle closure glaucoma, confirmed by finding a dilated pupil and raised intraocular pressure.
1.2 e A subconjunctival haemorrhage can occur spontaneously or following trauma. It is unusual for it to have any serious associations. Patients on anticoagulants should have an INR checked.
1.3 b This is the most likely diagnosis; a patient with bacterial conjunctivitis has a sticky discharge, patients with iritis have no discharge.
1.4 g Contact lens wearers are more likely to develop corneal ulcers.
1.5 a The symptoms suggest iritis and this is associated with sarcoidosis. The steroids may increase the pressure in some people but this is unlikely to cause a symptomatic acute glaucoma.
$2.1 \mathbf{h}$ The reduced vision occurring over a short time and pain on eye movements are typical. The relative afferent papillary defect points to an optic nerve problem. Acutely the fundus is normal, later optic nerve pallor may develop.
$2.2 \mathbf{j}$ Loss of vision for a few seconds when standing from sitting is a classical sign of raised intracranial pressure. Typically the vision is normal and colour vision full unless the papilloedema is very longstanding. Patients with raised intracranial pressure may also have a sixth nerve palsy regardless of the cause of the raised pressure. The fact that she is on the contraceptive pill and is overweight point to a diagnosis of benign intracranial hypertension (idiopathic intracranial hypertension). A full neurological examination, MRI scan and lumbar puncture would be needed to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other causes.
2.3 k This is a typical history of amaurosis fugax associated with the passage of a fibrin-platelet embolus. The patient will require a full vascular workup including imaging of the carotid arteries to see if an endarterectomy is indicated. Asprin may also be prescribed to prevent further emboli.
2.4 a The retinal appearance leads to the diagnosis. There may be an afferent papillary defect if there is marked retinal ischaemia.
2.5 e The history points to the diagnosis of giant cell (temporal) arteritis. The examination suggests optic nerve disease (relative afferent papillary defect) and the signs at the optic disc suggest an ischaemic optic neuropathy with cotton-wool spots, the cause of the white lesions at the disc. The
signs may be less dramatic than the ischaemic optic neuropathy associated with hypertension.
3.1 a The symptoms point to a diagnosis of endophthalmitis. Examination would show a reduced vision, inflammation and possibly a hypopyon in the anterior chamber and inflammation of the vitreous (vitritis). This is an acute ocular emergency requiring prompt treatment.
3.2 g The slow onset of the problem and time interlude make this the most likely diagnosis. It can be treated with a laser to make a small hole in the posterior capsule.
3.3 f The prodromal symptoms suggest that the vitreous jelly has detached from the retina producing a retinal tear. This has led to a retinal detachment with an associated loss of visual field.
3.4 b Patients with iritis are more likely to get cystoid macular oedema following cataract surgery but it can happen in any patient and may explain why the vision has not improved as much as expected.
$3.5 \mathbf{h}$ In any patient with a red eye following corneal graft surgery suspect corneal graft rejection if they subsequently develop a red eye and altered vision.
4.1 b The prostaglandin analogues are increasingly the first-line treatment in patients with glaucoma.
4.2 d This lady has acute angle closure glaucoma. The initial treatment is with intravenous acetazolamide, to reduce the pressure in the eye. Also, $\mathbf{g}$ - Pilocarpine eye drops are subsequently given to constrict the pupil. They may not be effective when the pressure in the eye is very high and the iris ischaemic.
4.3 e This lady has wet AMD and may benefit from intravitreal anti-VEGF injections.
4.4 f This patient has significant blepharitis and may benefit from tetracycline given for 2-3 months.
4.5 a It is likely that this patient has CMV retinitis and may benefit from systemic and intravitreal ganciclovir.
5.1 b The poorly reacting pupil is the key to the diagnosis; on a slit-lamp examination vermiform movements would be observed. Absent reflexes would help to confirm the diagnosis.
5.2 a The sign's suggest Horner's syndrome. The history of smoking make the investigation for associated chest neoplasia important.
5.3 e It is likely that he is taking pilocarpine to treat his glaucoma. This is an unusual drop to prescribe to treat the condition today but was a mainstay of treatment in the past.
$5.4 \mathbf{g}$ This is a relative afferent pupillary defect. The pallor of the optic disc confirms the likelyhood of optic nerve disease.
$5.5 \mathbf{h}$ Cyclopentolate drops are applied to dilate the pupil and allow an examination of the fundus to exclude any associated eye disease. Cyclopentolate also prevents the child accommodating permitting an
accurate refraction to be performed. Anisometropia can be associated with amblyopia and squint (see Chapter 15, Non-paralytic squint). The effect of the drops may last for some hours.
6.1 d A posteriorly placed visual pathway lesion causes a congruous defect (similar defect in both eyes), those affecting the optic tract are incongruous.
6.2 f It is likely that this lady has a non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy; this is the classical but not the only field defect seen in this condition.
$6.3 \mathbf{h}$ It is likely that this patient has retinitis pigmentosa. The signs are typical and a contraction of the visual field results.
6.4 b The symptoms suggest the possibility of a bitemporal hemianopia and the patient's performance on the Snellen chart helps to confirm the presence of this type of field defect arising from a chiasmal lesion.
6.5 e An arcuate field defect is typical of glaucoma.
$7.1 \quad \mathbf{k} \quad$ The symptoms suggest thyrotoxicosis and that the associated dysthyroid eye disease is also present.
7.2 e This is a left sixth nerve palsy with the lateral rectus muscle affected.
7.3 a The presence of a convergent squint requires referral to an eye hospital for further investigation to exclude a refractive error or ocular disease.
7.4 j The findings suggest Parinaud's syndrome associated with diseases in the pineal region of the brain (dorsal midbrain syndrome). See Chapter 15.
7.5 e Here the cause of the sixth nerve palsy is the trauma, it can also be a sign of raised intracranial pressure however.
8.1 a A perimeter is used to measure the visual field.
8.2 e A slit lamp allows a magnified 3-D view of the eye.
8.3 c A tonometer measures the pressure in the eye. See Chapter 2.
8.4 i Fluorescein angiography allows the circulation of the retina to be examined. See Chapter 2.
8.5 g A keratometer measures the curvature of the cornea. See Chapter 2.
9.1 a A cataract is the most likely cause of the reduced acuity and glare.
9.2 c The signs point towards optic nerve disease.
9.3 e Keratoconus causes a progressive astigmatism. This can often be treated with glasses or contact lenses but in more extreme cases may require a corneal graft.
9.4 f The floaters suggest that there has been a bleed into the vitreous from new vessels associated with proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
9.5 b The distortion of vision suggests a macula problem. The more gradual reduction in acuity suggests a 'dry' macular degeneration is present.
