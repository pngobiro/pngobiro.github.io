\section*{Introduction}

Ophthalmic diagnosis is heavily dependent on a good history and a thorough examination. The majority of ophthalmic diagnoses do not require additional tests. The sequence of history and examination is described below. It is imperative that hands are washed before and after each examination. If ocular infection is suspected then it may be necessary to disinfect the slit lamp and other
hand-held equipment. Equipment making contact with the eye, e.g. a diagnostic contact lens, is either disposable or routinely disinfected.

\section*{General ophthalmic history}

A good history must include details of:
- Ocular symptoms of visual loss or discomfort, with time of onset, eye affected and associated non-ocular symptoms (Table 2.1).
- Past ocular history (e.g. poor vision in one eye since birth, recurrence of previous disease, particularly inflammatory).
- Past medical history (e.g. of hypertension, which may be associated with some vascular eye diseases such as central retinal vein occlusion, diabetes, which may cause retinopathy, and systemic inflammatory disease such as sarcoid, which may also cause ocular inflammation).
- Drug history, since some drugs such as isoniazid and chloroquine may be toxic to the eye.
- Family history (e.g. of ocular diseases known to be inherited, such as retinitis pigmentosa, or of disease where family history may be a risk factor, such as glaucoma).
- Presence of allergies.

\section*{Table 2.1 Key points in the ophthalmic history.}

Consider the symptoms carefully
How long have they been present?
Are they continuous or intermittent?
What precipitated them?
What makes them better or worse?
How are they changing?
Are there associated symptoms?
Is there a history of previous eye, or relevant systemic, disease?
Is there a relevant drug history, family history or social history? (alcohol, smoking, exposure to chemicals)

\section*{Specific ophthalmic history}

The symptoms associated with specific eye disease are detailed here to enable you to form an overview of the important questions to ask in the ophthalmic history. You should revise this section when you have read more about the specific conditions described.

\section*{24 \\ History, symptoms and examination}

\section*{Red eye}

A red eye is one of the most common presenting complaints in ophthalmology. It means redness of the exposed white of the eye, i.e. the exposed conjunctiva and underlying sclera. It is associated with infection, inflammation, trauma and acute elevation of intraocular pressure (Table 2.2). Determining associated symptoms will help establish the diagnosis (Table 2.3).

\section*{Trauma}

A traumatic cause is usually obvious. Your history should note details of the event and whether this was due to blunt injury, a sharp object or a high-speed projectile. High-speed metal fragments from hammering may penetrate the globe and threaten sight. The patient may be entirely unaware of any ocular injury.
- Subconjunctival haemorrhage is bright red due to exposure to ambient oxygen levels, and obscures the white of the sclera. It may be traumatic or spontaneous, or may be associated with systemic hypertension or bloodclotting disorders including anticoagulant therapy (the international normalized ratio (INR) may need checking).
- Corneal foreign bodies and abrasions cause extreme pain and epiphora (watering). Sensory innervation is nociceptive, and higher than in any other part of the body, e.g. it is 400 times greater than in the fingertip. Corneal injury stimulates reflex antidromic vasodilatation of limbal episcleral vessels, termed a limbal or ciliary flush. This characteristic sign is often in the meridian of the lesion, aiding its detection, or it may surround the limbus when trauma is associated with iritis. Trauma can also cause conjunctival injection (vessel dilation).
- Chemical injury may be associated with generalized or local conjunctival inflammation, but alkali burns may cause ischaemic whitening, signifying severe tissue damage.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{Infection}

The commonest site of infection is the conjunctiva itself.
- Conjunctivitis is a generalized inflammation of the conjunctiva associated with symptoms of discharge and mild discomfort rather than pain. Any visual blur due to discharge is cleared on blinking. Bacterial infections are associated with a purulent discharge that may stick the lids together. Viral infections cause a more watery discharge. In severe cases, where the cornea is affected, the patient experiences photophobia and blurred vision. Chlamydial infections can produce a chronically red eye.
- Malposition of the lids (e.g. entropion) and lid margin inflammation (blepharitis) may cause secondary inflammation of the conjunctiva due to recurrent irritation. Blepharitis is usually without discharge and may be associated with acne rosacea, atopic dermatitis and other skin diseases. The patient complains of lid irritation or itching. In some cases, staphylococcal lid margin commensals may induce a hypersensitivity (immune complex) reaction in the peripheral cornea resulting in a marginal keratitis or ulcer, just central to the limbal vascular arcade. This is accompanied by a ciliary injection.
- Corneal infection affecting the visual axis is sight-threatening and may be associated with localized or general ocular redness. The eye is painful, particularly in acanthamoeba keratitis, and the vision reduced. There may be a mucopurulent discharge. A background history of contact lens use is common as an initiating factor.
- Intraocular infection (endophthalmitis) may occasionally occur within days following intraocular surgery. It causes a marked generalized conjunctival inflammation. The eye is painful (unusual after routine intraocular surgery) and the vision reduced. A history of recent surgery is the clue. Such a patient requires immediate referral to an eye unit.
- An infection of the orbit, orbital cellulitis, presents with swollen and often erythematous lids. The conjunctiva may be oedematous (chemotic) and red, and eye movements are reduced. The eye is proptosed. This is a medical emergency, for vision may be lost rapidly, due to optic nerve damage.

\section*{Acute glaucoma}

The sudden rise in pressure associated with acute angle closure glaucoma, and other causes of acute glaucoma, result in a generalized red eye, corneal clouding, reduced vision and severe pain. It needs urgent treatment.

\section*{Other forms of inflammation}

A number of other inflammatory diseases may present with a red eye, of which the commonest, mainly seen in primary care, is allergic eye disease.
- Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, or hayfever conjunctivitis, is a common disorder, particularly in the spring and summer when exposure to allergens is at its height. The conjunctiva is injected and may be chemosed; the eye itches and waters and there is accompanying sneezing (due to allergic rhinitis) as part of the overall picture of hayfever. Vision is unaffected, but the eye may be photophobic. Vernal keratoconjunctivitis, a chronic form of allergic eye disease, will also present as a red, itching, irritable eye and vision may be affected. There may be a history of atopy. With both there may be a mucus discharge.
- Dry eyes may also be associated with mild redness, irritation and 'tiredness' of the eye. In severe cases the vision may be blurred.
- In episcleritis the episcleral tissues are inflamed. This may result in focal or diffuse inflammation, and may or may not be painful. There is no discharge, and the vision is not reduced.
- In scleritis, inflammation of the sclera is associated with the collagen vascular diseases. Focal or generalized inflammation and swelling of the sclera is seen through the conjunctiva, which is also swollen. Pain is deep and boring.
- Other conjunctival or corneal lesions, for example pterygia and pingueculae, may present with focal redness. They are easily visible.
- A red eye may be associated with topical medication, for example the prostaglandin analogues used in the treatment of glaucoma.

\section*{Sudden visual loss}

Sudden uniocular loss of vision is caused either by a sudden clouding of the ocular media or by a problem with the retina or optic nerve. It is important to determine the onset and duration of the visual loss and whether there has been any progression or recovery. It is essential to establish whether this is truly a sudden loss of vision or whether it is a longstanding loss which has been revealed when the fellow eye was covered. It is always important to identify any associated features, such as visual symptoms or pain (Table 2.4), which preceded visual loss.

A general medical history is vital. For example, is the patient diabetic or hypertensive?

\section*{Opacities of the transparent media of the eye}
- The sudden onset of corneal oedema and clouding in acute angle closure glaucoma causes blurred vision, accompanied by severe pain and redness of the eye. There may be a history of attacks of blurred vision and eye pain or headache which then subsided. Such prodromal attacks may be precipitated

\begin{table}

\end{table}
in the dark, by pupil dilation, which causes a subacute attack of angle closure glaucoma.
- Visual loss may also occur quite quickly with keratitis or a corneal ulcer, again with redness, and usually with severe pain.
- A bleed into the vitreous is a common cause of sudden, painless visual loss and may result from a rupture of abnormal fine capillary vessels growing from the surface of the retina (proliferative diabetic retinopathy) or be associated with central retinal vein occlusion or 'wet' age-related macular degeneration. It may also follow a posterior vitreous detachment, when it is caused by a retinal tear and may precede a retinal detachment.
- Anterior uveitis may cause some blurring of vision when inflammatory cells adhering to the back of the cornea (keratic precipitates), or pupillary synechiae, lie on the visual axis.
- In posterior uveitis, visual loss may be caused by a vitritis (inflammation of the vitreous). This may be associated with a local retinitis or choroiditis, with further visual loss due to retinal damage. The eye will also be slightly painful and photophobic. Endophthalmitis is an extreme form of posterior uveitis, usually due to an intraocular bacterial infection following cataract surgery but also following penetrating injury to the globe. It presents with a rapidly escalating painful and profound visual loss. The vitreous is opacified by infiltrating polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) and exudative inflammatory products.

\section*{Retinal abnormalities}
- Total occlusion of the central retinal vein or retinal artery results in a sudden painless loss of vision involving the whole visual field. A branch occlusion causes a partial loss of vision.
- Wet age-related macular degeneration can cause a sudden loss or distortion of vision. Central vision is lost but peripheral vision is retained. Other acute disorders affecting the macula, such as central serous retinopathy or a macular hole, may cause sudden central visual loss.
- A retinal detachment may be preceded by floaters, due either to a small vitreous bleed (see above) or to a vitreous detachment and condensation of the vitreous gel. Vitreous detachment also puts traction on the retina, giving rise to the key symptom of flashing lights. Detachment itself results in a curtainlike loss of the visual field, which starts at the top of the visual field in the case of an inferior detachment, or at the bottom of the field if the detachment is superior.
- Inflammation of the retina associated with a posterior uveitis may cause visual loss, particularly if the macula or optic nerve is involved.
- A transient loss of vision, lasting minutes and described as 'a shutter' coming quickly across the vision, is typical of amaurosis fugax. It is caused by platelet emboli passing through the retinal circulation.
- Occasionally, visual loss is attributable to a migraine attack causing vasospasm of the retinal vessels. More commonly migraine presents with fortifica-
tion spectra or scintillating scotomata at the start of an attack due to transient ischaemia of the visual cortex.

\section*{Optic nerve abnormalities}
- Optic neuritis, due to focal demyelination of the optic nerve, causes loss of vision which develops over a few days. With retrobulbar neuritis the optic nerve head appears normal and, when the optic sheath is involved, the patient complains of pain on eye movement. Anterior optic neuritis is accompanied by nerve head swelling, or papillitis.
- Anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (AION) results from an acute decrease in blood supply to the optic nerve head. It presents with sudden loss of vision. It may be caused by giant cell arteritis (GCA), with associated symptoms of pain in the temple, jaw claudication, shoulder pain and tiredness. There is usually a profound loss of vision in the affected eye. GCA is a medical emergency requiring urgent treatment with steroids. AION may also be seen in patients with vascular disease accompanying ageing, diabetes or hypertension. The risk is increased in those with small optic discs which accommodate axonal swelling less readily. The loss of visual field is painless. Symptoms are often first noticed in the morning, perhaps reflecting the falls in blood pressure and optic nerve head perfusion pressure that occur during sleep. Visual loss commonly affects the upper or lower visual field.
- Episodes of visual loss lasting only a few seconds are typical of raised intracranial pressure. These visual 'obscurations' are often worse with a change in posture, and occur in the presence of papilloedema.
- The optic nerve may be compressed in orbital cellulitis, resulting in visual loss.

\section*{Visual loss involving both eyes}

This usually suggests disease of the visual pathway including the optic nerves or visual cortices. Occasionally an ocular cause may be found, for example if both eyes are affected by uveitis.

\section*{Gradual visual loss}

Patients may adjust to a gradual loss of vision, so there may be a lengthy delay before they seek medical help. This is particularly so in older patients with cataract. Also, in chronic glaucoma, because of its slow evolution, the patient may be unaware of a considerable degree of visual field loss until it is detected by chance or investigated when glaucoma is diagnosed at a routine assessment.
- Cloudy ocular media, due to the gradual development of corneal oedema, cataract or, rarely, vitreous opacity, are possible causes for a gradual, painless reduction in vision (Table 2.5).

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 2.5 Gradual visual loss: causes.}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Media cloudy & Corneal opacity \\
\hline (opacities in the comea, lens or vitreous & Cataract \\
\hline appear black against the red reflex) & Vitreous haemorrhage \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Media clear} \\
\hline Retinal disorder & Age-related macular degeneration \\
\hline & Macular/retinal dystrophy \\
\hline Optic nerve/pathway disorder & Optic neuropathy \\
\hline & Central nervous disease affecting visual pathways (e.g. visual cortex) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
- In patients with clear media, retinal abnormalities, particularly those affecting the macula, may be present. Retinal dystrophies often cause a gradual reduction in vision. Dry macular degeneration may also result in a slow, intermittent decline in central vision, sometimes accompanied by visual distortion.
- Compressive optic nerve disease is usually associated with gradual visual loss, which may also be caused by intracranial disease such as a pituitary tumour.

\section*{Ocular pain}

The presence of pain can be very useful in deciding the cause of other ocular symptoms. It is seldom the only presenting feature of eye disease, and most causes have already been discussed. They are summarized in Table 2.6.

\section*{Diplopia}

The onset of diplopia or double vision can be a worrying symptom, both for the patient and for the clinician! It is important, as ever, to obtain a full history (Table 2.7). The answers to these questions will often reveal the diagnosis. The first thing to exclude is a monocular diplopia, with a refractive cause such as cataract. The most common cause of binocular diplopia is an extraocular muscle paresis due to disease of the third, fourth or sixth cranial nerve (Table 2.8). These are usually painless, constant and acute. Testing the eye movements reveals the type of palsy present. Inter- and supranuclear palsies may also present acutely. The nature of the disorder in eye movements usually helps locate the site of the lesion. Intermittent double vision is typical of myasthenia, where the symptoms are worse as the patient tires.
- If thyroid eye disease is suspected (Graves' disease), look for the systemic features of that condition as well as the characteristic proptosis, restricted

\section*{Table 2.7 Establishing the history in a patient with diplopia.}

Was the onset sudden or gradual?
Is there a history of trauma?
Is the double vision present all the time?
Is it worse when the patient is tired?
Are the two images horizontally, vertically or diagonally (a skew deviation) displaced?
What are the associated symptoms (abnormalities of the pupils, other neurological symptoms)?
Are there any clues in the general medical history (diabetes, hypertension, thyroid disorders)?
Does the diplopia disappear when either eye is covered (to confirm a binocular cause for the diplopia)?
eye movements and acute inflammation over the insertion of the extraocular muscles.
- Trauma may cause a neurogenic diplopia if the cranial nerves are damaged, and a restrictive diplopia, when orbital tissue becomes trapped in an orbital fracture of the floor or medial wall of the orbit. Once again a good history will suggest the most likely diagnosis.

- Diplopia may result when a patient fails to control a longstanding squint. Here again the symptoms may be intermittent.
- Occasionally diplopia may have a monocular cause, usually corneal opacification or cataract. Cataract may cause a ghosting of vision rather than diplopia.

\section*{Examination}

Both structure and function of the eye are examined.

\section*{Physiological testing of the eye}

\section*{Visual acuity}

\section*{Adults}

Visual acuity (VA) tests the visual resolving power of the eye. The standard test is the Snellen chart, consisting of rows of letters (known as optotypes) of decreasing size (Figure 2.1a). Each row is numbered with the distance in metres at which each letter width subtends 1 minute of arc at the eye. Acuity is recorded as the reading distance (e.g. 6 metres) over the row number of the smallest letter seen. If this is the 6 metre line, then VA is $6 / 6$; if it is the 60 metre line, then VA is $6 / 60$. Snellen acuities are thus recorded as: $6 / 5,6 / 6,6 / 9,6 / 12,6 / 18 / 6 / 36 / 6 / 60$. Visual resolution is ten times greater at $6 / 6$ than $6 / 60$. Some countries

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 2.1 Methods of assessing visual acuity: (a) the Snellen chart; (b) a logMAR acuity chart; (c) examples of Cardiff cards.}
\end{figure}
(e.g. USA) use a different scale, with the foot as the unit of distance. 20/20 on this scale equates to $6 / 6$.

Increasingly, the logMAR visual acuity chart is being used, particularly in research (Figure 2.1b). Unlike the Snellen chart which shows uneven jumps in size from row to row, the logMAR letter sizes change in smooth, log linear steps. The number of letters on each line is equal, so that the lines of letters form a distinctive V-shaped pattern on the chart. The chart also allows accurate scoring of incompletely seen lines. Scores are recorded as a decimal, 0.00 equating to 6/6 (see Appendix).

Whatever chart is used, vision is tested with spectacles if worn. Viewing through a pinhole will correct for moderate refractive error.

\section*{Children}

In children, various methods are used to assess visual acuity:
- Very young children are observed to see if they can follow objects or pick up scattered 'hundreds and thousands' cake decorations.
- The Cardiff Acuity Test can be used to assess vision in 1- to 3-year-olds. This is a preferential looking test based on the finding that children prefer to look at complex rather than plain targets. The grey cards present a variety of figures surrounded by a white band bordered with two black bands; there are two pictures, one above the other (Figure 2.1c). The band widths define the acuity at the test distance. As the width of the bands decreases, the picture becomes harder to see against the grey background. The gaze of the child is observed and the examiner estimates whether the object seen is at the top or bottom of the card. When the examiner is unable to identify the position of the object from the child's gaze it is assumed that the child cannot see the picture and the resolution of the eye is inferred.
- Older children are able to identify or match single pictures and letters on charts which they hold in their hands, with those, of varying size, presented to them at a distance (Sheridan-Gardiner test).

\section*{Visual fields}

The visual fields map the peripheral extent of the visual world. Each field can be represented as a series of contours or isoptres, representing the ability to resolve a target of given size and brightness at a particular location. The field is not flat; towards the centre of fixation, the eye is able to detect much smaller objects than at the periphery. This produces a 'hill of vision' in which objects which are resolved in finest detail are at the peak of the hill (representing the fovea) and acuity falls towards the periphery (Figure 2.2). On the temporal side of the field is the blind spot, which corresponds to the position of the optic nerve head, where there are no photoreceptors.

The visual field may be tested in various ways.

\section*{Confrontation tests}

In this simple test, the examiner compares their own field with that of the patient. One eye of the patient is covered and the examiner sits opposite,

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-049.jpg?height=1708&width=630&top_left_y=343&top_left_x=396}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 2.2 The hill of vision: (a) shown diagrammatically; (b) a normal plot of the visual field of the left eye. The different lines (isoptres) correspond to different sizes or intensities of the target. (Adapted with permission from Anderson, D.R. (1982) Testing the Field of Vision. Mosby-Year Book, Inc., St Louis.)}
\end{figure}
closing his eye on the same side. If the patient's left eye is covered the examiner closes their own, right eye. The test object, traditionally the head of a large white hat pin, is then brought into view from the periphery and moved centrally. The patient is asked to say when they first see the object. Each quadrant is tested and the location of the blind spot determined. With practice and more effectively using a red target, central scotomas can also be identified. (A scotoma is a focal area of decreased sensitivity within the field, surrounded by a more sensitive area.)

\section*{A crude test for hemianopic or quadrantic defects}
- Sit facing the patient and hold your hands up, palms forwards, one on either side of the midline. Ask the patient to cover one eye and look directly at your face. Enquire if the two palms appear qualitatively the same. The patient may notice that the outer (temporal) palm appears duller. Repeat the test with the fellow eye. This can be useful in picking up a bitemporal hemianopia in patients with a chiasmal lesion. Such patients may also miss the temporal letters on the Snellen chart when their visual acuity is measured.
- Ask the patient to count the number of fingers which you show in each quadrant of the visual field.

A useful way to identify a neurological field defect is to use a red target. The red field is the most sensitive to optic nerve lesions. A red-topped pin is used to perform a confrontation test, the patient being asked to say when he first sees the pin top as red (not when he first sees the pin top). More simply, a red object can be held in each quadrant or hemifield and the patient asked to compare the quality of red in each location. In a hemianopic field defect the red would appear duller in the affected field.

\section*{Perimeters}

These machines permit more accurate plotting of the visual field. They measure:
- The kinetic visual field, in which the patient indicates when he first sees a light of a specific size and brightness brought in from the periphery. This is rather like the moving pinhead of the confrontation test.
- The static visual field, in which the patient indicates when he first sees a stationary light of increasing brightness, presented anywhere in the visual field.

These techniques are particularly useful in chronic ocular and neurological conditions, to monitor changes in the visual field (e.g. in glaucoma or compressive lesions of the visual pathway).

Increasingly sophisticated perimeters are being developed using computer programs that enable the time it takes to perform an accurate visual field to be reduced. These measure the threshold stimuli (the minimum intensity of light of a standard-sized source that the subject is able to see $50 \%$ of the time) for a number of points in the visual field. The intensity of light is recorded in decibels: the higher the number the dimmer the light (Figure 2.3).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-051.jpg?height=1372&width=1063&top_left_y=294&top_left_x=282}

This is pictorially represented in the upper right picture. The middle diagrams compare the subject's field with that of a normal age-matched population. The lower diagrams indicate how likely it is that the value of each location differs from this control population.}
\end{figure}

Perimeters that test different pathways in the visual system have also been developed. For example a flickering target tests the M-cell pathway, responsible for motion detection. These may be important in diseases that may selectively affect one pathway, such as glaucoma.

\section*{Intraocular pressure}

Intraocular pressure is measured by a contact technique, with a Goldmann tonometer (Figure 2.4). A clear plastic cylinder is pressed against the anaesthetized cornea. The ring of flattening, viewed through the cylinder, is made visible by the presence of fluorescein in the tear film (see below). A horizontally disposed prism, within the cylinder, splits the ring of contact into two hemicircles. The force applied to the cylinder can be varied to alter the amount of corneal flattening and thus the size of the ring. It is adjusted so that the two hemicircles just interlock. This is the endpoint of the test and the force applied, converted into units of ocular pressure ( mmHg ), can now be read from the tonometer.

Optometrists use a puff of air of varying intensity to produce corneal flattening rather than the prism of the Goldmann tonometer. Various other tonometers are also available, including small hand-held electronic devices.

The thickness of the cornea has a significant effect on the measurement of intraocular pressure, affecting the accuracy of measurement with contact tonometers. These tonometers underestimate the pressure where the cornea is thin and easier to deform. A thicker cornea requires more force for the same deformation, leading to an overestimation of intraocular pressure. Measurement of corneal thickness can now readily be performed with small hand-held ultrasonic pachymeters, which are used increasingly to make the appropriate correction.

\section*{Pupillary reactions}

The size of the pupils (miosis, constricted; mydriasis, dilated) and their response to light and accommodation give important information about:
- the function of the afferent pathway controlling the pupils (the optic nerve and tract) (see Chapter 13);
- the function of the efferent pathway;
- the action of drugs on the pupil.

Examination of the pupils begins with an assessment of the size and symmetry of the pupils in a uniform light. If there is asymmetry (anisocoria) it must be decided whether the smaller or larger pupil is abnormal. A pathologically small pupil (after damage to the sympathetic nervous system) will be more apparent in dim illumination, since dilation of the normal pupil will be greater. A pathologically large pupil (seen in disease of the parasympathetic nervous system) will be more apparent in the light since the fellow pupil will be small.

While some individuals show pupil asymmetry unassociated with disease, remember that inflammation of the anterior segment (iritis), trauma or previ-

conjunction with accommodation and convergence. This is termed the near reflex.

The next step is to look for a defect in optic nerve function, using the 'swingingflashlight test'. This is a sensitive index of an afferent conduction defect. The patient is seated in a dimly illuminated room and views a distant object. A torch is directed at each eye in turn while the pupils are observed. The light is directed at the eye from the side to avoid stimulating the near reflex. A unilateral defect in optic nerve conduction is demonstrated as a relative afferent pupil defect (RAPD) (see Figure 2.5 for full description and Chapter 14 for clinical importance).

\section*{Eye movements}

These are assessed while sitting facing the patient who is asked to look at a torch light held directly ahead. In the absence of squint and with the eyes in forward gaze (the 'primary position'), the reflection of light from the corneas will be symmetrically disposed. If a squint is present and only one eye is fixated on the light, then the reflection from the non-fixating eye is displaced to one side. The direction of displacement indicates the nature of the squint (see Chapter 15).

Record the following:
- the position of the eyes;
- the range of eye movements;
- the type of eye movements.

An abnormal direction of one of the eyes in the primary position of gaze (looking straight ahead) may suggest a squint. This can be confirmed by performing a cover test (see Chapter 15).

The range of eye movements is assessed by asking the subject to follow a moving object. Horizontal, vertical and oblique movements are checked from the primary position of gaze, asking the patient to report any double vision (diplopia). The presence of oscillating eye movements (nystagmus) (see Chapter 15) is also noted. Movement of the eyes when following an object is recorded. Such movements (pursuit movements) are usually smooth but may be altered in disease. The ability to direct gaze rapidly from one object to another (saccadic eye movements) can be tested by asking the patient to look at targets (such as the finger) held at either side of the head. These movements should be fast, smooth and accurate (that is, they should not overshoot or undershoot the target). In children, use a toy or other interesting object to assess eye movements while gently steadying the child's head.

\section*{Eyelids}

These are usually symmetrical in height. The margin of the lid is applied closely to the globe in the healthy eye. If the lid margin is turned away from the globe an ectropion is present; if the lid margin is turned in and the lashes are rubbing against the globe an entropion is present.

A drooping lid (ptosis) may reflect:
- an anatomical disorder (e.g. a congenital or age-related failure of the levator tendon to insert properly into the tarsal plate);
- an organic problem (e.g. weakness of the levator muscle in myasthenia gravis or impairment of its nerve supply in third nerve palsy).

In assessing ptosis, the distance between the upper and lower lids is measured with the patient looking straight ahead. The excursion of the upper lid from extreme downgaze to extreme upgaze is then recorded. In myasthenia, repeated up and down movements of the lids will increase the ptosis by fatiguing the levator muscle (see Chapter 5).

\section*{Anatomical examination of the eye}

\section*{Lids and anterior segment}

Simple examination of the eye and adnexae can reveal a great deal about pathological processes within the eye.

Ophthalmologists use a biomicroscope (slit lamp) to examine the eye and lids. This provides a magnified, stereoscopic view. The slit of light permits a cross-section of the transparent media of the eye to be viewed. By adjusting the angle between this beam and the viewing microscope the light can be used to highlight different structures and pathological processes within the eye. Each structure is carefully examined, starting with the lids and working inwards.

\section*{Examination without a slit lamp}

Without a slit lamp the eye can still be meaningfully examined with a suitable light such as a pen torch or ophthalmoscope. Comment can be made on:
- The conjunctiva: is it injected (inflamed), is there a discharge, what is the distribution of redness, is a conjunctival haemorrhage present?
- The cornea: is it clear, is there a bright reflection of light from the overlying tear film?
- The anterior chamber: is it intact (if penetrating injury is suspected), is a hypopyon present (see Chapter 9)?
- The iris and pupil: is the shape of the pupil normal?
- The lens: is there an opacity in the red reflex observed with the ophthalmoscope?

\section*{Diagnostic use of fluorescein}

Fluorescein has the property of absorbing light in the blue wavelength and emitting a green fluorescence. The application of fluorescein to the eye can identify corneal abrasions (where the surface epithelial cells have been lost) and leakage of aqueous humour from the eye where the cornea has been penetrated or a wound is unhealed (Figure 2.6).

\section*{To examine an abrasion}
- A weak, highly fluorescent, solution of the dye is applied to the eye.
- The eye is examined with a blue light.
- The abrasion fluoresces bright green.

\section*{To determine if fluid is leaking from the eye (e.g. after penetrating corneal injury)}
- A drop of $2 \%$ solution of fluorescein - which is not fluoresent - is applied to the eye.
- The eye is examined with a blue light.
- The dye, diluted by the leaking aqueous, becomes bright green at its junction with the dark, concentrated fluorescein.

\section*{Eversion of the upper lid}

The underside of the upper lid is examined by everting it over a small bluntended object (e.g. a cotton bud) placed in the lid crease (Figure 2.7). This is an important technique to master as foreign bodies may often lodge under the upper lid, causing considerable pain to the patient.

\section*{Retina}

The retina is examined by:
- Direct ophthalmoscopy (the conventional ophthalmoscope) (Figure 2.8).
- Indirect ophthalmoscopy, which allows the extreme retinal periphery to be viewed. The examiner wears a head-mounted binocular microscope with a

\begin{figure}

light source. A lens placed between the examiner and the eye of the subject is used to produce an inverted image of the retina.
- Special lenses (e.g. 90 dioptre and 3 mirror) are also used at the slit lamp.

The latter two techniques are reserved for specialists; the technique that must be mastered by the non-specialist is direct ophthalmoscopy.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-058.jpg?height=799&width=540&top_left_y=294&top_left_x=495}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 2.8 The technique of direct ophthalmoscopy. Note that the left eye of the observer is used to examine the left eye of the subject. The closer the observer is to the patient the larger the field of view.}
\end{figure}

The direct ophthalmoscope provides:
- an image of the red reflex - a red glow in the pupil zone due to light scattered from the vascular choroid;
- a magnified view of the optic nerve head, macula, retinal blood vessels and the retina to the equator.

It comprises:
- a light source, the size and colour of which can be changed;
- a system of lenses which permits the refractive error of both observer and patient to be corrected.

Confident use of the ophthalmoscope comes with practice. The best results are obtained if the pupil is first dilated with tropicamide, a mydriatic with a short duration of action.

The patient and examiner must be comfortable; the patient looks straight ahead at a distant object. The examiner's right eye is used to examine the patient's right eye, and the left eye to examine the left eye.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-059.jpg?height=519&width=659&top_left_y=298&top_left_x=484}

\caption{Figure 2.9 A normal left fundus. Note the optic disc with retinal veins and arteries passing from it to branch over the retina. The large temporal vessels form the temporal arcades. The macula lies temporal to the disc with the fovea at its centre.}
\end{figure}

The examiner views the red reflex through the pupil at a distance of about 30 cm from the eye. Corneal or lens opacities appear as dark silhouettes against the red reflex, brought into focus by ratcheting down the ophthalmoscope from a high to a low hypermetropic (plus) correction. The eye is then approached to within a couple of centimetres and the power of the lenses is adjusted in the myopic (minus) direction, to achieve focus on the retina.

The examiner may find it helpful to place a steadying hand on the subject's forehead, which can also be used to hold the upper lid open. The retina should now be in view. It is important to try and examine the retina in a logical sequence so that nothing is overlooked.
- First find the optic disc (Figure 2.9). With the eye looking straight ahead, approach the eye at an angle of $15^{\circ}$ temporal to the line of gaze to avoid light reflection from the cornea. Assess the margins of the optic disc (are they indistinct - as in papilloedema?). Assess the colour of the disc (is it pale - as in optic atrophy?). Assess the optic cup (see Chapter 10).
- Direct the ophthalmoscope slightly temporally and examine the macula. Is there a normal foveal reflex? (In youth the foveal pit appears as a bright pinpoint of light in the centre of the retina.) Are there any abnormal lesions such as haemorrhages, exudates or cotton-wool spots?
- Return to the optic disc and follow each major vessel branch of the vasculature out to the periphery. Are the vessels of normal diameter? Do the arteries nip the veins where they cross (A/V nipping - in hypertension)? Are there any emboli in the arterioles? Also examine the surrounding retina for abnormalities.
- Examine the peripheral retina systematically, in a $360^{\circ}$ sweep.

\section*{Direct ophthalmoscopy}
- Use an ophthalmoscope with a good illumination.
- Before examining the patient, set the ophthalmoscope power to a low plus, allowing you to focus through from the front to the back of the eye.
- Retinal examination requires that the examiner is close to the subject. An inadequate view will result if the examiner is too far away.
- Where the patient is highly short-sighted, you will find it easier to view the fundi if the patient's spectacles stay in place.
- Practice, practice, practice.

\section*{Special examination techniques}

\section*{Diagnostic lenses}

Ophthalmologists employ special lenses that can be used in conjunction with the slit lamp to examine particular ocular structures.

A gonioscopy lens is a diagnostic contact lens with a built-in mirror that permits examination of the iridocorneal angle. A larger lens with three mirrors allows the peripheral retina to be seen with the pupil dilated. Both are applied to the anaesthetized cornea with a lubricating drop. Other lenses can be used to obtain a stereoscopic view of the retina.

\section*{Retinoscopy}

The technique of retinoscopy allows the refractive state of the eye to be measured (i.e. the required strength of a corrective spectacle lens). A streak of light from the retinoscope is directed into the eye. The reflection from the retina is observed through the retinoscope. By gently moving the retinoscope from side to side the reflected image is seen to move. The direction in which this image moves depends on the refractive error of the eye. By placing trial lenses of increasing or decreasing power in front of the eye, the direction in which the reflected image moves is seen to reverse. When this point is reached the refractive error has been determined.

\section*{Investigative techniques}

\section*{Ultrasound}

This is used extensively in ophthalmology to provide information about the vitreous, retina and posterior coats of the eye (see Figure 11.7), particularly when they cannot be clearly visualized (if, for example, there is a dense cataract or vitreous haemorrhage). Ultrasound is also used to measure the length of the eyeball prior to cataract surgery to estimate the power of the artificial lens that is to be implanted into the eye (see Chapter 8).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-061.jpg?height=727&width=1055&top_left_y=296&top_left_x=287}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 2.10 A contour map of the cornea obtained with a photokeratoscope. The colours represent areas of different corneal curvature and hence different refractive power.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Keratometry}

The shape of the cornea (the radius of curvature) can be measured from the image of a target reflected from its surface. This is important in contact lens assessment (Chapter 3), refractive surgery (Chapter 3) and in calculating the power of an artificial lens implant in cataract surgery (Chapter 8). The technique of photo-keratometry allows a very accurate contour map of the cornea to be produced (Figure 2.10). These techniques can be used to detect aberrations of shape such as a conical cornea (keratoconus).

\section*{Synoptophore}

This machine permits the assessment of binocular single vision, the ability of the two eyes to work together to produce a single image. It can also assess the range over which the eyes can move away from (diverge) or towards each other (converge) whilst maintaining a single picture (to measure the range of fusion).

\section*{Exophthalmometer}

This device measures ocular protrusion (proptosis).

\section*{Electrophysiological tests}

The electrical activity of the retina and visual cortex in response to specific visual stimuli, for example a flashing light, can be used to assess the functioning of the retina (electroretinogram or ERG), RPE (electro-oculogram) and the visual pathway (visually evoked response or potential).

\section*{Radiological imaging techniques}

Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans have largely replaced skull and orbital radiographs in the imaging of the orbit and visual pathway. The newer diagnostic techniques have enhanced the diagnosis of orbital disease (e.g. optic nerve sheath meningioma) and visual pathway lesions such as pituitary tumours. They have also become the first-line investigation in orbital trauma.

\section*{Fluorescein angiography}

This technique (Figure 2.11) provides detailed information about the retinal circulation. Fluorescein dye is injected into the antecubital vein. A fundus camera is used to take photographs of the retina. A blue light is directed into the eye to 'excite' the fluorescein in the retinal circulation. The emitted green light is then photographed through a yellow barrier filter which absorbs any reflected blue light and allows the fluorescent image to be seen at high contrast.

In this way a fluorescent picture of the retinal circulation is obtained (Figure 2.12). The dye leaks from abnormal blood vessels (e.g. the new vessels some-

times seen in diabetic eye disease). Areas of ischaemia, due to retinal capillary closure, fail to demonstrate the normal passage of dye (e.g. in a central retinal vein occlusion). The technique is useful both in diagnosis and in planning and following treatment.

Indocyanin green angiography (ICG) allows the choroidal vasculature to be imaged in a similar way.

\section*{Digital imaging and laser scanning techniques}

New techniques of retinal imaging, such as confocal microscopy, have been developed to improve the quality of retinal and optic disc pictures and to permit quantitative assessment of features such as the area of the optic disc and optic disc cup (Chapter 10) and the size of retinal lesions (Chapter 11). These will help in the assessment of patients with chronic diseases such as glaucoma, diabetes and macular degeneration, where the management requires an accurate assessment of any change over time.

\section*{Introduction}

Light can be defined as that part of the electromagnetic spectrum to which the retina is sensitive. The visible part of the spectrum lies between the wavebands 390 nm and 760 nm . For the eye to generate accurate visual information light must be correctly focused on the retina. The focus must be adjustable to allow equally clear vision of near and distant objects. The cornea, or actually the air/ tear interface, is responsible for two-thirds of the focusing power of the eye, and the crystalline lens for one-third. These two refracting elements in the eye converge the rays of light because:
- The refracting surfaces of the cornea and lens are spherically convex.
- The cornea has a higher refractive index than air; the lens has a higher refractive index than the aqueous and vitreous humours that surround it. The velocity of light is reduced in a dense medium so that light is refracted towards the normal. When passing from the air to the cornea, or from the aqueous to the lens, the rays therefore converge.

\section*{Ametropia}

When parallel rays of light from a distant object are brought to a focus on the retina with the eye at rest (i.e. not accommodating) the refractive state of the eye is known as emmetropia (Figure 3.1). Such an individual can see sharply in the distance without accommodation.

In ametropia, parallel rays of light are not brought to a focus on the retina with the eye at rest. A change in refraction is required to achieve sharp vision. Ametropia may be divided into:
- Myopia (short-sightedness): the optical power of the eye is too high (usually due to an elongated globe) and parallel rays of light are brought to a focus in front of the retina (Figure 3.2).

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 3.3 Correction of ametropia with spectacle lenses.}
\end{figure}
- Hypermetropia (long-sightedness): the optical power is too low (usually because the eye is too short) and parallel rays of light converge towards a point behind the retina (Figure 3.2).
- Astigmatism: the optical power of the cornea in different planes is not equal. Parallel rays of light passing through these different planes are brought to different points of focus.

All three types of ametropia can be corrected by spectacle lenses (Figure 3.3). These diverge the rays in myopia, converge the rays in hypermetropia, and correct for the non-spherical shape of the cornea in astigmatism. It should be noted that in hypermetropia, accommodative effort will bring distant objects into focus by increasing the power of the lens. This will use up the accommodative reserve for near objects.

\section*{Accommodation and presbyopia}

As an object of regard is brought nearer to the eye, focus is maintained by an increase in the power of the lens of the eye. This is brought about by ciliary muscle contraction, which relaxes zonular tension on the lens equator and allows the lens to take up a more spherical shape. This is accommodation (Figure 3.4). The eyes also converge.

The ability to accommodate decreases with age, reaching a critical point at about 40-plus years, when the subject experiences difficulty with near vision (presbyopia). This occurs earlier in hypermetropes than in myopes. The problem is overcome with convex reading lenses, which provide the converging power no longer supplied by the lens of the eye.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-075.jpg?height=250&width=655&top_left_y=296&top_left_x=484}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 3.4 The effect of accommodation on the lens.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Optical correction after cataract extraction}

The lens provides one-third of the refractive power of the eye, so that after cataract extraction (the removal of an opaque lens) the eye is rendered highly hypermetropic, a condition termed aphakia. This can be corrected by:
- the insertion of an intraocular lens at the time of surgery;
- contact lenses;
- aphakic spectacles.

Intraocular lenses (IOLs) give the best optical results and are routinely used in the developed world and increasingly used in the developing world. These are placed at the site of the natural lens and mimic its performance. As they are unable to change shape the eye cannot accommodate. An eye with an IOL is said to be pseudophakic.

Hinged lenses are available, which can achieve a degree of accommodative effect and also multifocal IOLs, which combine a distance and near correction. Multifocal lenses may not suit everybody because of optical side effects (reduced contrast and glare), so it is important to counsel patients preoperatively. Multifocal lenses may allow patients to be independent of spectacles for both distance and near vision.

Contact lenses are worn at the surface of the cornea and produce slight magnification of the retinal image ( $110 \%$ ); this is not of visual significance. Insertion, removal and cleaning can be difficult for elderly patients or those with physical disability (e.g. arthritis).

Aphakic spectacles are corrective spectacles which are provided when no IOL has been used. They have a number of disadvantages:
- They are powerful positive lenses which magnify the retinal image by about $133 \%$, causing the patient to misjudge distances. They cannot be used to correct one eye alone if the other eye is phakic (the natural lens is in situ) or pseudophakic, because of the disparity in image size between the two corrected eyes (aniseikonia). This causes symptoms of dizziness and diplopia.
- Aphakic lenses induce many optical aberrations, including distortion of the image due to the thickness of the lens.

\section*{Contact lenses}

These are made either from rigid gas-permeable or from soft hydrophilic materials. All contact lenses retard the diffusion of oxygen to the cornea but rigid gas-permeable lenses are relatively more permeable than soft lenses. Although soft lenses are better tolerated physically, gas-permeable lenses have certain advantages:
- Their greater oxygen-permeability reduces the risk of corneal damage from hypoxia.
- Their rigidity allows easier cleaning and offers less risk of infection.
- Their rigidity permits an effective correction of astigmatism.
- Proteinaceous debris is less likely to adhere to the lens and cause an allergic conjunctivitis.

Daily disposable contact lenses are available which are discarded on the day of use.

Thin, soft contact lenses without a refractive function may also be used as ocular bandages, e.g. in the treatment of some corneal diseases such as a persistent epithelial defect.

\section*{Spectacles}

Spectacles are available to correct most refractive errors. Lenses can be made to correct long- and short-sightedness and astigmatism. They are simple and safe to use but may be lost or damaged. Some people find them cosmetically unacceptable and prefer to wear contact lenses. The correction of presbyopia requires additional lens power to overcome the eye's reduced accommodation for near focus. This can be achieved with:
- separate pairs of glasses for distance and near vision;
- a pair of bifocal lenses, where the near correction is added to the lower segment of the distance lens;
- varifocal lenses, where the power of the lens gradually changes from the distance correction (in the upper part) to the near correction (in the lower part). This provides sharper middle-distance vision but the lenses may be difficult to manage.

People with particular needs, such as musicians, may also need glasses for middle distance.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 3.5 Some examples of low-vision aids. Most aid near tasks such as reading. Two monocular telescopes, to help with distance vision, are shown at the top.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Low-vision aids}

Patients with poor vision can be helped by advice on lighting conditions and low-vision aids. Clinics specializing in low vision are available in most eye units. Devices used include:
- magnifiers for near vision (Figure 3.5);
- telescopes for distance vision;
- closed-circuit television to provide magnification and improve contrast;
- large-print books;
- talking clocks and watches;
- a variety of gadgets to help the patient manage household tasks.

\section*{Refractive surgery}

Although refractive errors are most commonly corrected by spectacles or contact lenses, laser surgical correction is gaining popularity. The excimer laser is used to precisely ablate a superficial layer of stromal tissue from the cornea to modify its shape and alter its refractive function. Myopia is corrected by
flattening the cornea and hypermetropia by steepening it. In photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), the laser is applied to the corneal surface after removing the epithelium. The cornea is resurfaced in a few days. In laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), the epithelium is intact. A hinged, partial-thickness flap of corneal stroma is first created with a rapidly moving automated blade. The flap is lifted and the laser applied to the stromal bed to alter its contour. The flap is then restored to its original position. Unlike PRK, LASIK provides a near instantaneous improvement in vision with minimal discomfort. Laserassisted subepithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) creates only an epithelial flap, leaving a thicker stroma. This may be important in those with a thin cornea. The LASEK flap takes longer to heal than a LASIK flap. Serious complications during flap creation occur rarely.
Patients experience discomfort for a few days after PRK although the level of pain can be reduced by provision of a bandage contact lens and treatment with topical or systemic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Intraocular lenses can also be placed in a phakic eye to correct severe refractive error, but this carries all the risks of intraocular surgery and the possibility of cataract formation.

\section*{The orbit}

\section*{Learning objective}
$\checkmark$ To understand the symptoms, signs, causes and investigation of orbital disease.

\section*{Introduction}

The orbit provides:
- protection to the globe;
- attachments which stabilize ocular movements;
- foramina for the transmission of nerves and vessels.

Despite the number of different tissues present in the orbit, the expression of diseases due to different pathologies is often similar.

\section*{Clinical features}

\section*{Proptosis}

Proptosis, or exophthalmos, is a protrusion of the eye caused by a spaceoccupying lesion. It can be measured with an exophthalmometer. A difference of prominence of more than 3 mm between the two eyes is significant. Various other features give a clue to the pathological process involved (Figure 4.1).
- If the eye is displaced directly forwards it suggests a space-occupying lesion lying within the extraocular muscle cone (an intra-conal lesion). An example would be an optic nerve sheath meningioma.
- If the eye is displaced to one side, a lesion outside the muscle cone is likely (an extra-conal lesion). For example, a tumour of the lacrimal gland displaces the globe to the nasal side.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-081.jpg?height=1012&width=1055&top_left_y=296&top_left_x=287}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 4.1 Sites of orbital disease.}
\end{figure}
- A transient proptosis induced by increasing the cephalic venous pressure (by a Valsalva manoeuvre) is a sign of orbital varices.
- The speed of onset of proptosis may also give clues to the aetiology. A slow onset suggests a benign tumour whereas rapid onset is seen in inflammatory disorders, malignant tumours and caroticocavernous fistula.
- The presence of pain may suggest infection (e.g. orbital cellulitis).

\section*{Enophthalmos}

Enophthalmos is a backward displacement of the globe. It is a feature of an orbital 'blowout fracture', when blunt injury to the globe and orbit fractures a thin orbital wall and displaces orbital contents into an adjacent sinus. It was also said to occur in Horner's syndrome, but this is really a pseudo-enophthalmos due to narrowing of the palpebral fissure (see Chapter 13).

\section*{Pain}

Inflammatory conditions, infective disorders and rapidly progressing tumours cause pain. This is not usually present with benign tumours.

\section*{Eyelid and conjunctival changes}

Conjunctival injection and swelling suggest an inflammatory or infective process. Infection is associated with reduced eye movements, erythema and swelling of the lids (orbital cellulitis). With more anterior lid inflammation (preseptal cellulitis), eye movements are full and the globe is not inflamed, thus excluding the more serious, orbital cellulitis.

Florid engorgement of the conjunctival vessels suggests a caroticocavernous fistula (see below).

\section*{Binocular diplopia}

Binocular diplopia occurs when only one of the two eyes is fixated on a target. Thus the image in the second eye does not fall upon the fovea. This can be due to:
- Direct involvement of the muscles in myositis and dysthyroid eye disease (Graves' disease). The eye appears to be tethered, so that eye movement is restricted in a direction away from the field of action of the affected muscle (e.g. if the inferior rectus is thickened in thyroid eye disease there will be restriction of upgaze).
- Involvement of the nerve supply to the extraocular muscles (paralytic squint). Here, diplopia occurs during gaze into the field of action of the muscle (e.g. palsy of the right lateral rectus produces diplopia in right horizontal gaze).

\section*{Visual acuity}

This may be reduced by:
- exposure keratopathy from severe proptosis, when the cornea is no longer protected by the lids and tear film;
- optic nerve involvement by compression or inflammation;
- distortion of the macula due to compression of the globe by a posterior, space-occupying lesion.

\section*{Investigation of orbital disease}

CT and MRI scans have greatly helped in the diagnosis of orbital disease-localizing the site of the lesion, demonstrating enlarged intraocular muscles in dysthyroid eye disease and myositis, or visualizing fractures to the orbit.

Additional systemic tests will be dictated by the differential diagnosis (e.g. tests to determine the primary site of a secondary tumour).

\section*{Differential diagnosis of orbital disease}

Traumatic orbital disease is discussed in Chapter 16.

\section*{Disorders of the extraocular muscles}

Dysthyroid eye disease and ocular myositis present with symptoms and signs of orbital disease. They are described in Chapter 15.

In children a rapidly developing proptosis may be caused by a rare rhabdomyosarcoma of the extraocular muscles (see Orbital tumours, below).

\section*{Infective disorders}

Orbital cellulitis is a serious condition which can cause blindness and may spread to cause a brain abscess (Figure 4.2). The infection often arises from an adjacent ethmoid sinus, reflecting that the medial wall of the orbit is extremely thin. The commonest causative organisms are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. The patient presents with:
- a painful, proptosed eye;
- conjunctival injection;
- periorbital inflammation and swelling;
- reduced eye movements;
- possible visual loss;
- systemic illness and pyrexia.

An MRI or CT scan is helpful in diagnosis and in planning treatment. The condition usually responds to intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, but it may be necessary to drain an abscess or decompress the orbit, particularly if the optic nerve is compromised. Optic nerve function must be watched closely,

\end{figure}
checking acuity, monitoring colour vision and testing for a relative afferent pupillary defect. Orbital decompression is usually performed with the help of an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.

A preseptal cellulitis involves lid structures alone (Figure 4.3). It presents with periorbital inflammation and swelling but not the other ocular features of orbital cellulitis. Eye movement is not impaired.

An orbital mucocoele arises from accumulated secretions within any of the paranasal sinuses when natural drainage of the sinus is blocked. Surgical excision may be required.

\section*{Inflammatory disease}

The orbit may be involved in various inflammatory disorders, including sarcoidosis and orbital pseudotumour, a non-specific lymphofibroblastic disorder. Diagnosis of such conditions is difficult. The presence of other systemic signs of sarcoidosis may be helpful. If an orbital pseudotumour is suspected it may be necessary to biopsy the tissue to differentiate the lesion from a lymphoma.

\section*{Vascular abnormalities}

A fistula may develop between the internal carotid artery or a dural artery, in the cavernous sinus, and the cavernous sinus itself (caroticocavernous sinus fistula). As a result, the orbital veins are exposed to a high intravascular pressure, the eye is proptosed and the conjunctival veins are dilated and engorged. The patient may complain of a pulsatile tinnitus and a bruit may be heard with a stethoscope over the eye, in time with the radial pulse. Extraocular muscle engorgement reduces eye movements, and increased pressure in the veins draining the eye causes an increased intraocular pressure. Interventional radio-

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-085.jpg?height=406&width=659&top_left_y=296&top_left_x=484}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 4.4 The appearance of a capillary haemangioma.}
\end{figure}
logical techniques can be used to close the fistula by embolizing and thrombosing the affected vascular segment.

The orbital veins may become dilated (orbital varix), causing intermittent proptosis when venous pressure is raised.

In infants, a capillary haemangioma may present as an extensive lesion of the orbit, affecting the skin of the lid (Figure 4.4). Swelling of the upper lid may cause sufficient ptosis to cause amblyopia. Fortunately most undergo spontaneous resolution in the first 5 years of life. Treatment is indicated if size or position obstructs the visual axis and risks the development of amblyopia (see Chapter 15). Local injections of steroid are usually successful in reducing size and recently it has been shown that intralesional or systemic propranolol may cause rapid regression of the lesion (Figure 4.5).

\section*{Orbital tumours}

The following tumours may produce signs of orbital disease:
- lacrimal gland tumours;
- optic nerve gliomas;
- meningiomas;
- lymphomas;
- rhabdomyosarcomas;
- metastasis from other systemic cancers (neuroblastomas in children, the breast, lung, prostate or gastrointestinal tract in adults).

A CT or MRI scan will help with the diagnosis (Figure 4.6). Again systemic investigation, for example to determine the site of a primary tumour, may be required.

Malignant lacrimal gland tumours carry a poor prognosis. Benign tumours still require complete excision to prevent malignant transformation. Optic nerve gliomas may be associated with neurofibromatosis. They are difficult to treat but are often slow-growing and thus may require no intervention. Meningiomas of the optic nerve are rare, and may also be difficult to excise.

\begin{figure}

Again, they can be monitored over time and some may benefit from treatment with radiotherapy. Meningiomas arising from the middle cranial fossa may spread through the optic canal into the orbit. The treatment of lymphoma requires a full systemic investigation to determine whether the lesion is indica-

\end{figure}
tive of widespread disease or whether it is localized to the orbit. In the former case the patient is treated with chemotherapy, in the latter with localized radiotherapy.

In children the commonest orbital tumour is a rhabdomyosarcoma, a rapidly growing, malignant tumour of striated muscle. Chemotherapy is effective if the disease is localized to the orbit.

\section*{Dermoid cysts}

These congenital lesions are caused by the continued growth of ectodermal tissue beneath the surface, which may present in the medial or lateral aspect of the superior orbit (Figure 4.7). Excision is usually performed for cosmetic reasons and to avoid traumatic rupture, which may cause scarring. Some may be attached deeply by a stalk, and a CT scan may be necessary before surgery to identify this deeper connection. Dermoids may also occur at the limbus.

\section*{KEY POINTS}
- Suspect orbital cellulitis in a patient with proptosis and periorbital and conjunctival inflammation, particularly when there is severe pain and the patient is systemically unwell.
- The commonest cause of bilateral proptosis is dysthyroid disease.
- The commonest cause of unilateral proptosis is also dysthyroid disease.
- Dysthyroid disease may be associated with the serious complications of exposure keratopathy and optic nerve compression.

\section*{PAEDIATRIC OPHTHALMOLOGY}
- Treat a child with proptosis as an ophthalmic emergency.
- A capillary haemangioma may cause the pupil to be covered and cause amblyopia.

\section*{74 The orbit}

\section*{Multiple choice questions}
1. A 56-year-old female patient presents with a proptosed eye, deviated nasally.
a An eye displaced to one side of the orbit suggests an extra-conal lesion.

c The patient may have dysthyroid eye (Graves') disease.
d The patient may have a rhabdomyosarcoma of the extraocular muscles.
e Diplopia is a common presenting feature of orbital disease.
2. A 16-year-old boy presents with swollen eyelids, a red eye, proptosis, severe eye pain and tenderness and a pyrexia. The vision has become very blurred and colour vision is reduced.
a Orbital cellulitis is the most likely diagnosis.

a Dysthyroid eye (Graves') disease.
b A caroticocavernous sinus fistula.
c An orbital varix.
d A dermoid cyst.

\section*{Answers}
1. A 56 -year-old female patient presents with a proptosed eye, deviated nasally.
a True. It is likely that the lesion is outside the muscle cone causing an asymmetric deviation of the eye.
b True. A rapid onset of proptosis is also seen in inflammatory disorders and caroticocavernous sinus fistula.
c True. See Chapter 15, page 245.
d False. This is seen in much younger patients.
e True. This may result form direct involvement of the muscle or its nerve supply.
2. A 16-year-old boy presents with swollen eyelids, a red eye, proptosis, severe eye pain and tenderness and a pyrexia. The vision has become very blurred and colour vision is reduced.
a True. These are the classic symptoms.
b True. The reduced acuity and colour vision suggests that the optic nerve is compromised, so that a relative afferent pupillary defect is expected.
c False. An urgent CT of the orbit should be undertaken to confirm the diagnosis. Blood cultures may also be helpful.
d True. Successful decompression may save optic nerve function.
3. A 70-year-old woman with a history of previous head trauma presents with sudden onset of a red, proptosed eye. Eye movements are reduced in all directions. Vision is intact. Intraocular pressure is increased.
a False. While possible, it is not the most likely diagnosis.
b True. These are the classic features, including the history of trauma.
c False. A varix causes an intermittent proptosis, worsened by an elevated venous pressure, such as may occur with a Valsalva manoeuvre.
d False. Dermoid cysts occur in a much younger age group. They do not cause proptosis and usually present as a swelling at the medial or lateral aspect of the orbit.

\section*{5 \\ \section*{The eyelids}}

\section*{Learning objectives}

To understand:
$\checkmark$ The symptoms, signs and causes of abnormal eyelid position.
$\checkmark$ The symptoms, signs and treatment of blepharitis.
$\checkmark$ The causes of lid swellings.

\section*{Introduction}

The eyelids are important both in providing physical protection to the eyes and in ensuring a normal tear film and tear drainage. Diseases of the eyelids can be divided into those associated with:
- abnormal lid position;
- inflammation;
- lid lumps;
- abnormalities of the lashes.

\section*{Abnormalities of lid position}

\section*{Ptosis}

This is an abnormally low position of the upper eyelid (Figure 5.1).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-091.jpg?height=340&width=661&top_left_y=296&top_left_x=484}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 5.1 Left ptosis.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Pathogenesis}

It may be caused by:
1 Mechanical factors.
a Large lid lesions pulling the lid down.
b Lid oedema.
c Tethering of the lid by conjunctival scarring.
d Structural abnormalities, including a disinsertion of the aponeurosis of the levator muscle, usually in elderly patients.
2 Neurological factors.
a Third nerve palsy (see Chapter 15).
b Horner's syndrome, due to a sympathetic nerve lesion (see Chapter 13).
c Marcus-Gunn jaw-winking syndrome. In this congenital ptosis there is a congenital mis-wiring of the nerve supply to the pterygoid muscle of the jaw (cranial nerveV) and the levator of the eyelid (cranial nerve III) so that the eyelid moves in conjunction with movements of the jaw.
3 Myogenic factors.
a Myasthenia gravis (see Chapter 15).
b Some forms of muscular dystrophy.
c Chronic external ophthalmoplegia.

\section*{Symptoms}

Patients present because:
- they object to the cosmetic effect;
- vision may be impaired;
- there are symptoms and signs associated with the underlying cause (e.g. asymmetric pupils in Horner's syndrome, diplopia and reduced eye movements in a third nerve palsy).

\section*{Signs}

There is a reduction in size of the palpebral aperture. The upper lid margin, which usually overlaps the upper limbus by $1-2 \mathrm{~mm}$, may partially cover the
pupil or the eye may be completely closed. The function of the levator muscle can be tested by measuring the maximum travel of the upper lid from full upgaze to full downgaze (normally $15-18 \mathrm{~mm}$ ). It is common for the eyebrows to be elevated in the presence of ptosis, as a compensatory event which offsets the ptosis. Pressure on the brow (frontalis muscles) during the test will prevent this contribution to lid elevation. Other signs, associated with, for example, Horner's syndrome or a third nerve palsy, may be present.

Four diagnostic tests may be performed if myasthenia is suspected.
1 In myasthenia, repeated elevation and depression of the eye results in an increased ptosis.
2 Manual retraction of the upper lid causes a ptosis or increased ptosis in the fellow eye. It is argued that the withdrawal of the stimulus to raise the retracted lid reduces the stimulus to elevation bilaterally.
3 Ask the patient to look down for 15 seconds and then look up at an elevated target. The lid overshoots and then falls slightly after the period of rest (Cogan's twitch test).
4 Ice (in a rubber glove), applied to the lid for 2 minutes, significantly reduces a myasthenic ptosis.

\section*{Management}

In the absence of a medically treatable disease such as myasthenia gravis, ptosis otherwise requires surgical correction. In very young children this is usually deferred, but may be expedited if the visual axis is covered and threatens to induce amblyopia.

\section*{Entropion}

This is an inturning of the lid margin and lashes, usually of the lower lid, towards the globe (Figure 5.2). It may occur if the patient looks downwards or

be induced by forced lid closure. It is seen most commonly in elderly patients where the orbicularis muscle is weakened. It may also be caused by conjunctival scarring, drawing the lid inwards (cicatricial entropion). The inturned lashes abrade the cornea and cause marked irritation of the eye. The eye may be red. Short-term treatment includes the application of lubricants to the eye or taping of the lid to turn the lashes away from the globe. The condition can be alleviated for a period by the injection of botulinum toxin into the palpebral part of the orbicularis muscle of the lower lid, or cured permanently by surgery.

\section*{Ectropion}

Here there is an eversion of the lid away from the globe (Figure 5.3). Usual causes include:
- age-related orbicularis muscle laxity;
- scarring of the periorbital skin;
- seventh nerve palsy.

The malposition of the lids everts the puncta and prevents drainage of the tears, leading to epiphora. It also exposes the conjunctiva and lower globe to dehydration (see Chapter 6). Ectropion causes an irritable eye. Surgical treatment is again an effective treatment.

\section*{Inflammations of the eyelids}

\section*{Blepharitis}

This is a very common, chronic inflammation of the lid margins (Figure 5.4). In anterior blepharitis inflammation of the lid margin is concentrated in

\begin{figure}

\caption{Figure 5.4 Blepharitis. (a) A diagram showing the signs. (b) The clinical appearance of the lid margin. Note (1) the scales on the lashes, (2) dilated blood vessels on the lid margin and (3) plugging of the meibomian glands.}
\end{figure}
the lash line and accompanied by squamous debris around the eyelashes. The conjunctiva becomes injected. It is sometimes associated with a chronic staphylococcal infection. In severe disease the cornea is affected (blepharokeratitis). Small infiltrates or ulcers may form in the peripheral cornea (marginal keratitis) due to an immune complex response to staphylococcal exotoxins.

In posterior blepharitis (or meibomian gland dysfunction) the meibomian glands are usually obstructed by squamous debris. The two forms may occur independently.

\section*{Symptoms}

These include:
- tired, itchy, sore eyes, worse in the morning;
- crusting of the lid margins in anterior blepharitis and redness in both.

\section*{Signs}

In anterior blepharitis there may be:
- redness and scaling of the lid margins; some lash bases may be ulcerated - a sign of staphylococcal infection;
- debris in the form of a collarette around the eyelashes (cylindrical dandruff). This may indicate an infestation of the lash roots by Demodex folliculorum.
- a reduction in the number of eyelashes.

In posterior blepharitis there may be:
- obstruction and plugging of the meibomian orifices;
- thickened, cloudy, expressed meibomian secretions;
- injection of the lid margin and conjunctiva;
- tear film abnormalities and punctate keratitis.

Both forms of blepharitis are strongly associated with seborrhoeic dermatitis, atopic eczema and acne rosacea. In rosacea there is hyperaemia and telangiectasia of the facial skin and a rhinophyma (a bulbous irregular swelling of the nose with hypertrophy of the sebaceous glands).

\section*{Treatment}

This is often difficult and must be long-term for these chronic conditions.
For anterior blepharitis, lid toilet with a cotton bud wetted with bicarbonate solution or diluted baby shampoo helps to remove squamous debris from the lash line. Topical steroids can reduce inflammation but must be used infrequently, to avoid steroid complications. Staphylococcal lid disease may also require therapy with topical antibiotics (e.g. fusidic acid gel), and occasionally with systemic antibiotics. Demodex infestation responds to the application of 'tea tree oil'.

For meibomian gland dysfunction, abnormal secretions can be expressed by lid massage after hot bathing through the closed lids. If this treatment fails, then there may be a place for topical azithromycin drops. Alternatively, meibomian gland function can be improved by short courses of oral tetracycline. Where meibomian gland obstruction is extensive, the absence of an oily layer on the tear film can induce an evaporative dry eye, which requires treatment with artificial tears.

\section*{Prognosis}

Although symptoms may be ameliorated by treatment, blepharitis may remain a chronic problem.

\section*{Benign lid lumps and bumps}

\section*{Chalazion}

This is a common, painless condition in which an obstructed meibomian gland causes a granuloma within the tarsal plate (Figure 5.5). Symptoms are of an unsightly lid swelling which usually resolves within 6 months. If the lesion persists it can be incised and the gelatinous contents curetted away.

An abscess (internal hordeolum) may also form within the meibomian gland and, unlike a chalazion, this is painful. It may respond to topical antibiotics but usually incision is necessary.

A stye (external hordeolum) is an exquisitely painful abscess of an eyelash follicle. Treatment requires the removal of the associated eyelash and application of hot compresses. Most cases are self-limiting, but occasionally systemic antibiotics are required.

\section*{Molluscum contagiosum}

This umbilicated lesion found on the lid margin is caused by a pox virus (Figure 5.6). It causes irritation of the eye. The eye is red, and small elevations of lymphoid tissue are found on the tarsal conjunctiva (follicular conjunctivitis). Treatment requires excision of the lid lesion.

\caption{Figure 5.6 Molluscum contagiosum.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Cysts}

Various cysts may form on the eyelids. Sebaceous cysts are opaque. They rarely cause symptoms. They can be excised for cosmetic reasons. A cyst of Moll is a small translucent cyst on the lid margin caused by obstruction of a sweat gland. A cyst of Zeis is an opaque cyst on the eyelid margin caused by blockage of an accessory sebaceous gland. These too can be excised for cosmetic reasons.

\section*{Squamous cell papilloma}

This is a common, frond-like lid lesion with a fibrovascular core and thickened squamous epithelium (Figure 5.7a). It is usually asymptomatic but can be excised for cosmetic reasons with cautery to the base.

\section*{Xanthelasmas}

These are lipid-containing bilateral lesions which may in youth be associated with hypercholesterolaemia (Figure 5.7b). It is worth checking the blood cholesterol. They are excised for cosmetic reasons.

\section*{Keratoacanthoma}

This is a brownish pink, fast-growing lesion with a central crater filled with keratin (Figure 5.7c). Treatment is by excision. Careful histology must be performed as some may have the malignant features of a squamous cell carcinoma (see below).

\section*{Naevus (mole)}

These lesions are derived from naevus cells (altered melanocytes) and can be pigmented or non-pigmented. No treatment is necessary.

\section*{Malignant tumours}

\section*{Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)}

This is the most common form of malignant tumour (Figure 5.8). Ten per cent of cases occur in the eyelids and account for $90 \%$ of eyelid malignancies. The tumour is:
- slow-growing;
- locally invasive;
- non-metastasizing.

Patients present with a painless lesion on the eyelid which may be nodular, sclerosing or ulcerative (the so-called rodent ulcer). Typically, it has a pale, pearly margin. A high index of suspicion is required. Treatment is by:

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 5.8 A basal cell carcinoma.}
\end{figure}
- Excision biopsy with a margin of normal tissue surrounding the lesion. For large lesions threatening important tissues, excision may be controlled with frozen sections and serial sections used to determine the need for additional tissue removal (Mohs surgery). This minimizes destruction of normal tissue.
- Cryotherapy.
- Radiotherapy.

The prognosis is usually very good, but deep invasion of the tumour can be difficult to treat.

\section*{Squamous cell carcinoma}

This is a less common but more malignant tumour which can metastasize to the lymph nodes. It can arise de novo or from pre-malignant lesions. It may present as a hard nodule or a scaly patch. Treatment is by excisional biopsy with a margin of healthy tissue.

Ultraviolet (UV) exposure is an important risk factor for both basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma.

When a squamous cell carcinoma is suspected, it is essential to check for the presence of affected cervical lymph nodes.

\section*{Abnormalities of the lashes}

\section*{Trichiasis}

This is a common condition in which aberrant eyelashes are directed backwards towards the globe. It is distinct from entropion. The lashes rub against the cornea and cause irritation and abrasion. It may result from any cicatricial process. In developing countries, trachoma (see Chapter 17) is an important cause and trichiasis is an important basis for the associated blindness.

Treatment is by epilation of the offending lashes. Recurrence can be treated with cryotherapy or electrolysis. Any underlying abnormality of lid position needs surgical correction.

\section*{KEY POINTS}
- Blepharitis is a common cause of sore 'tired' irritable eyes.
- A patient with an umbilicated lesion and a sore red eye may have molluscum contagiosum.
- Abnormalities of eyelid position can cause corneal disease.
- Always consider the possibility of malignancy in lid lesions.

\section*{The lacrimal system}

\section*{Learning objectives}

To understand:
$\checkmark$ The symptoms, signs, causes and treatment of dry eyes.
$\checkmark$ The symptoms, signs, causes and treatment of watery eyes.

\section*{Introduction}

Disorders of the lacrimal system are common and may produce chronic symptoms with a significant morbidity. The lacrimal glands normally produce about $1.5 \mu \mathrm{l}$ of tears per minute. Some tears are lost by evaporation, while the remainder drain via the nasolacrimal system. The tear film is re-formed with each blink.
Abnormalities are found in:
- tear flow and evaporation;
- the drainage of tears.

\section*{Abnormalities in tear flow and evaporation - dry eye}

Dry eye is a condition of the ocular surface due to a deficiency of tear quantity or composition or excessive evaporation, characterized by hyperosmolarity
and leading to ocular surface damage, inflammation and symptoms of discomfort and visual loss. An alternative term is keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS).

\section*{Aqueous-deficient dry eye}

A deficiency of lacrimal secretion occurs with age and may be sufficient to cause dry eyes. When dry eyes occur in combination with a dry mouth and dryness of other mucous membranes the condition is called primary Sjögren's syndrome (an autoimmune exocrinopathy). Other organ systems may be affected. When Sjögren's syndrome occurs in association with a specific autoimmune connective tissue disorder the condition is called secondary Sjögren's syndrome. Rheumatoid arthritis is the commonest of these associated disorders. Diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome is confirmed by the demonstration of reduced lacrimal and salivary function, the presence of raised titres of anti-Rho and anti-La antibodies and the demonstration of T-cell infiltration of biopsied minor salivary glands.

\section*{Symptoms}

Patients have non-specific symptoms of grittiness, burning, photophobia, heaviness of the lids and ocular fatigue. Symptoms are worse in the evening because the eyes dry progressively during the day. In more severe cases visual acuity may be reduced by corneal damage.

\section*{Signs}

In mild cases there are few obvious signs. Staining of the eye with fluorescein will show small dots of fluorescence (punctate staining) over the exposed corneal and conjunctival surfaces. In severe cases (Figure 6.1) tags of abnormal mucus may attach to the corneal surface (Figure 6.2) (filamentary keratitis), causing pain due to tugging on these filaments during blinking.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 6.2 Fluorescein staining of filamentary keratitis.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Treatment}

Supplementation of the tears with tear substitutes helps to reduce symptoms, and a humid environment can be created around the eyes with shielded spectacles. In severe cases it may be necessary to occlude the puncta with plugs, or more permanently with surgery, to conserve the tears. Topical anti-inflammatory agents are also in use (e.g. cyclosporin).

\section*{Prognosis}

Mild disease usually responds to artificial tears and tear conservation. Severe disease, such as that in rheumatoid Sjögren's, can be very difficult to treat.

\section*{Evaporative dry eye - inadequate meibomian oil delivery}

Extensive meibomian gland obstruction may result in a deficient tear film lipid layer and lead to increased water loss from the eyes. This results in tear hyperosmolarity in its own right and also may exacerbate an existing aqueousdeficient dry eye. Treatment of the meibomian gland dysfunction (a form of posterior blepharitis) is covered in Chapter 5.

\section*{Evaporative dry eye - malposition of the globe or lid margins}

If the lids are not adequately apposed to the eye (ectropion), or there is incomplete lid closure (lagophthalmos - e.g. in a seventh nerve palsy), or if the eye protrudes (proptosis) as in dysthyroid eye disease, then the preocular tear film will not form adequately and an evaporative form of dry eye will result. It may also occur in conditions of infrequent blinking, such as Parkinson's disease.

Correction of the lid deformity is required for ectropion. In other instances, if the defect is temporary, artificial tears and lubricants can be applied. If lid

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 6.3 A lateral tarsorrhaphy protects a previously exposed cornea.}
\end{figure}
closure is inadequate, a temporary ptosis can be induced with a local injection of botulinum toxin into the levator muscle to effect a short-term paralysis. A more permanent result can be obtained by suturing together part of the apposed margins of the upper and lower lids (e.g. lateral tarsorrhaphy; Figure 6.3).

\section*{Cicatricial conjunctival disorders}

Loss of goblet cells occurs in most forms of dry eye, but particularly in cicatricial conjunctival disorders such as erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome). In this there is an acute episode of inflammation causing macular 'target' lesions on the skin and discharging lesions on the eye, mouth and vulva. In the eye this causes conjunctival shrinkage with adhesions forming between the globe and the conjunctiva (symblepharon). There may be both an aqueous, meibomian and a mucin deficiency, and problems due to lid deformity and trichiasis. Chemical burns of the eye, particularly by alkalis, and trachoma (chronic inflammation of the conjunctiva caused by chlamydial infection; see Chapters 7 and 17) may have a similar end result.
The symptoms are similar to those seen with an aqueous deficiency. Examination may reveal scarred, abnormal conjunctiva and areas of fluorescein staining on the cornea and conjunctiva. Treatment requires the application of artificial lubricants.
Vitamin A deficiency (xerophthalmia) is a condition causing childhood blindness on a worldwide scale. It is associated with generalized malnutrition in countries such as India and Pakistan. Goblet cells are lost from the conjunctiva and the ocular surface becomes keratinized (xerosis). An aqueous deficiency may also occur. The characteristic corneal melting and perforation which occur in this condition (keratomalacia) may be prevented by early treatment with vitamin A (see Chapter 17 for a more detailed description).

\section*{Disorders of tear drainage}

When tear production exceeds the capacity of the drainage system, excess tears overflow onto the cheeks. It may be caused by:
- irritation of the ocular surface, e.g. by a corneal foreign body, infection or blepharitis;
- occlusion of any part of the drainage system (when the tearing is termed epiphora).

\section*{Obstruction of tear drainage (infantile)}

The nasolacrimal system develops as a solid cord which subsequently canalizes and is patent just before term. Congenital obstruction of the duct is common. The distal end of the nasolacrimal duct may remain imperforate, causing a watering eye. If the canaliculi also become partially obstructed, the nondraining pool of fluid in the sac may become infected and accumulate within a mucocoele or cause dacrocystitis. Diagnostically, the discharge may be expressed from the puncta by pressure over the lacrimal sac. The conjunctiva, however, is not inflamed. Most obstructions resolve spontaneously in the first year of life. If epiphora persists beyond this time, patency can be achieved by passing a probe via the punctum through the nasolacrimal duct to perforate the occluding membrane (probing). A general anaesthetic is required.

\section*{Obstruction of tear drainage (adult)}

The tear drainage system may become blocked at any point, although the most common site is the nasolacrimal duct. Causes include infections or direct trauma to the nasolacrimal system and, occasionally, topically applied drugs.

\section*{History}

The patient complains of a watering eye, sometimes associated with stickiness. The eye is white. Symptoms may be worse in the wind or in cold weather. There may be a history of previous trauma or infection.

\section*{Signs}

A stenosed punctum may be apparent on slit lamp examination. Epiphora is unusual if one punctum continues to function. Acquired obstruction beyond the punctum is diagnosed by syringing the nasolacrimal system with saline, using a fine cannula inserted into a canaliculus. A patent system is indicated when the patient tastes the saline as it reaches the pharynx. If there is an

On the right it has entered the lacrimal sac but not the nasolacrimal duct indicating an obstruction to flow here.
obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct then fluid will regurgitate from the noncannulated punctum. The exact location of the obstruction can be confirmed by injecting a radio-opaque dye into the nasolacrimal system (dacrocystogram). X-rays are then used to follow the passage of the dye through the system. A more physiological test follows the passage of a drop of technetium isotope, applied to the lateral conjunctival sac, through the drainage system using a gamma camera (dacroscintogram) (Figure 6.4).

\section*{Treatment}

It is important to exclude other ocular disease that may contribute to watering, such as blepharitis. Repair of the occluded nasolacrimal duct requires surgery to connect the mucosal surface of the lacrimal sac to the nasal mucosa by removing the intervening bone (dacryocystorhinostomy or DCR; Figure 6.5). The operation can be performed through an incision on the side of the nose but it may also be performed endoscopically through the nasal passages, thus avoiding a scar at the root of the nose.

\end{figure}

\section*{Infections of the nasolacrimal system}

Closed obstruction of the drainage system predisposes to infection of the sac (dacryocystitis; Figure 6.6). The organism involved is usually Staphylococcus or Streptococcus. Patients present with a painful swelling on the medial side of the orbit, which is the enlarged, infected sac. Treatment is with systemic antibiot-
ics. A mucocoele results from a collection of mucus in an obstructed sac; it is not grossly infected and is often painless. In either case a DCR may be necessary to remove its contents and achieve a patent nasolacrimal system.

\section*{KEY POINTS}
- Dry eyes can cause significant ocular symptoms and signs.
- In an adult a watery eye is due either to excessive lacrimation or dysfunction or blockage of the tear drainage system.

\section*{PAEDIATRIC OPHTHALMOLOGY}
- A watery eye in a newborn child is commonly due to non-patency of the nasolacrimal duct. Most spontaneously resolve within the first year of life.

\section*{Introduction}

Disorders of the conjunctiva and cornea are a common cause of symptoms. The ocular surface is regularly exposed to the external environment and subject to trauma, infection and allergic reactions - which account for the majority of diseases in these tissues. Degenerative and structural abnormalities account for a minority of problems.

\section*{Symptoms}

Patients may complain of the following:
1 Pain and irritation. Conjunctivitis alone is seldom associated with anything more than mild discomfort. Pain signifies something more serious such as corneal injury or infection. This symptom helps differentiate conjunctivitis from corneal disease.

2 Redness. In conjunctivitis the entire conjunctival surface including that covering the tarsal plates is involved. If the redness is localized to the limbus ( $a$ ciliary flush) the following should be considered:
a keratitis (an inflammation of the cornea);
b uveitis (see Chapter 9);
c acute glaucoma (see Chapter10).
3 Discharge. Purulent discharge suggests a bacterial conjunctivitis. Viral conjunctivitis is associated mainly with a more watery discharge.
4 Visual loss which is not cleared by blinking. This occurs only when the central cornea is affected. Loss of vision is thus an important symptom requiring urgent action.
5 Patients with corneal disease may also complain of photophobia.

\section*{Signs}

The following features may be seen in conjunctival disease:
- Papillae. These are raised lesions on the upper tarsal conjunctiva, about 1 mm or more in diameter with a central vascular core. They are a non-specific sign of chronic inflammation. They result from inflammatory infiltrates within the conjunctiva, constrained by the presence of multiple, tiny fibrous septa. Giant papillae are typical of allergic eye disease and are formed by the coalescence of papillae (see Figure 7.4). They are also seen as a reaction to contact lens wear.
- Follicles (Figure 7.1). These are raised, gelatinous, oval lesions about 1 mm in diameter, found usually in the lower tarsal conjunctiva and upper tarsal border, and occasionally at the limbus. Each follicle represents a lymphoid collection with its own germinal centre. Unlike papillae, the causes of follicles are more specific (e.g. viral and chlamydial infections) and they are therefore a clue to aetiology.
- Dilation of the conjunctival vasculature (termed injection).

\caption{Figure 7.2 Pannus.}
\end{figure}
- Subconjunctival haemorrhage, often bright red in colour because it is fully oxygenated by the ambient air, through the conjunctiva.

The features of corneal disease are different, and include the following:
- Epithelial and stromal oedema, causing clouding of the cornea.
- Cellular infiltrate in the stroma causing focal, granular white spots.
- Deposits of cells on the corneal endothelium (termed keratic precipitates or KPs, neutrophils with fine KPs and lymphocytes or macrophages with coarse ('mutton fat') KPs; see Chapter 9).
- Chronic keratitis may stimulate new blood vessels superficially, under the epithelium (pannus; Figure 7.2) or deeper in the stroma. Stromal oedema, which causes swelling and separates the collagen lamellae, facilitates vessel invasion.
- Punctate epithelial erosions (PEE) are points of superficial epithelial cell loss or dysfunction which may be isolated or scattered, or confluent. On the cornea they are best detected using fluorescein dye, viewed with a blue light. Similar PEE occur on the conjunctiva and are best stained by lissamine green. More extensive epithelial loss, due to chemical or physical trauma, is referred to as an abrasion.

\section*{Conjunctiva}

\section*{Inflammatory diseases of the conjunctiva Bacterial conjunctivitis}

Patients present with:
- redness of the eye;
- discharge;
- ocular irritation.

The commonest causative organisms are Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pneumococcus and Haemophilus. The condition is usually self-limiting, although a broad-spectrum antibiotic eye drop will hasten resolution. Conjunctival swabs for culture are indicated in severe disease or if the condition fails to resolve.

\section*{Antibiotics}

Some of the antibiotics available for topical ophthalmic use. Chloramphenicol is an effective broad-spectrum agent; an unproven risk of bone marrow aplasia is a moot point.
- Azithromycin.
- Ceftazidine.
- Chloramphenicol.
- Ciprofloxacin.
- Fusidic acid.
- Gentamicin.
- Neomycin.
- Tetracycline.
- Ofloxacin.

\section*{Ophthalmia neonatorum}

Ophthalmia neonatorum, refers to any conjunctivitis that occurs in the first 28 days of neonatal life and is a notifiable disease requiring urgent treatment. Swabs for culture are mandatory. It is also important that the cornea is examined to exclude any ulceration.

The commonest causative agents are:
- Bacterial conjunctivitis (usually Gram-positive).
- Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In severe cases this can cause corneal perforation. Systemic complications include rhinitis, stomatitis, arthritis, meningitis and septicaemia. Due to increasing resistance to penicillin a systemic, thirdgeneration cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) is used to treat the condition. The eye must be kept clean. Topical bacitracin ointment can also be given but systemic treatment is the most important. Refer parents to a sexually transmitted diseases clinic.
- Herpes simplex, which can cause corneal scarring. Topical antivirals are used to treat the condition.
- Chlamydia. This may be responsible for a chronic conjunctivitis and cause sight-threatening corneal scarring. Topical tetracycline ointment and systemic erythromycin are used to treat the local and systemic disease respectively. Refer parents to a sexually transmitted diseases clinic.

\section*{Viral conjunctivitis}

This is distinguished from bacterial conjunctivitis by:
- a watery and limited purulent discharge;
- the presence of conjunctival follicles (hence follicular conjunctivitis). Preauricular lymph nodes are also enlarged;
- there may also be lid oedema and excessive lacrimation.

The commonest causative agent is adenovirus, and to a much lesser extent Coxsackie and picornavirus. Adenovirus conjunctivitis is self-limiting but highly contagious and frequently occurs in epidemics. There is a risk of hospitalacquired infection, which can arise where there is failure to hand wash and disinfect equipment when managing a patient with a red eye and conjunctivitis. Certain adenovirus serotypes also cause a troublesome punctate keratoconjunctivitis, in which vision is affected, and which may have visual sequelae. Adenoviruses can also cause a conjunctivitis associated with the formation of a pseudomembrane across the conjunctiva. Patients must be given hygiene instruction to minimize the spread of infection in the home (e.g. frequent hand washing; using separate towels). Treatment of keratoconjunctivitis is controversial. No effective commercial antiviral is available. Antibacterial therapy is not indicated unless there is a secondary bacterial infection The use of topical steroids damps down symptoms and causes corneal opacities to resolve, but rebound inflammation is common when the steroid is stopped, and the corneal opacities reappear.

\section*{Chlamydial infections}

Different serotypes of the obligate intracellular organism Chlamydia trachomatis are responsible for two forms of ocular infections.

\section*{Inclusion keratoconjunctivitis}

This is a sexually transmitted disease and may take a chronic course (up to 18 months) unless adequately treated. Patients present with a mucopurulent follicular conjunctivitis and develop a micropannus (superficial peripheral corneal vascularization and scarring) associated with subepithelial scarring. Urethritis or cervicitis is common. Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of chlamydial antigens, using immunofluorescence, or by identification of typical inclusion bodies by Giemsa staining in conjunctival swab or scrape specimens.

Inclusion conjunctivitis is treated with topical and systemic tetracycline. The patient should be referred to a sexually transmitted diseases clinic.

\section*{Trachoma}

This is the commonest infective cause of blindness in the world, although it is uncommon in developed countries (more details will be found in Chapter 17). The housefly acts as a vector, and the disease is encouraged by poor hygiene

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-116.jpg?height=406&width=1082&top_left_y=289&top_left_x=226}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 7.3 Trachoma: scarring of (a) the upper lid (everted) and (b) the cornea.}
\end{figure}
and overcrowding in a dry, hot climate. The hallmark of the disease is subconjunctival fibrosis caused by frequent re-infections associated with the unhygienic conditions. Blindness may occur due to corneal scarring from recurrent keratitis and trichiasis (Figure 7.3).

Trachoma is treated with oral or topical tetracycline or erythromycin. Azithromycin, an alternative, requires only a single oral dose. Entropion and trichiasis require surgical correction.

\section*{Allergic conjunctivitis}

This may be divided into acute and chronic forms:
1 Acute (hayfever, or seasonal allergic conjunctivitis) is an acute IgE-mediated reaction to airborne allergens (usually pollens, e.g. ragweed, and mite allergens). Symptoms and signs include:
a itchiness;
b conjunctival injection and swelling (chemosis);
c lacrimation.
2 Vernal conjunctivitis (spring catarrh) is also mediated by IgE. It often affects male children with a history of atopy. It is usually seasonal but may be present all year long and may become a chronic and intractable disease. Symptoms and signs include:
a itchiness;
b photophobia;
c lacrimation;
d papillary conjunctivitis on the upper tarsal plate (papillae may coalesce to form giant cobblestones; Figure 7.4);
e limbal follicles and white spots;
f punctate lesions on the corneal epithelium;
g an opaque, oval plaque which in severe disease replaces an upper zone of the corneal epithelium.

Initial therapy is with mast cell stabilizers (e.g. sodium cromoglycate, nedocromil, lodoxamide) or antihistamines (e.g. levocabastine), or with agents combining mast cell stabilizing and antihistamine properties (e.g. olopatidine).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-117.jpg?height=440&width=659&top_left_y=298&top_left_x=484}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 7.4 The appearance of giant (cobblestone) papillae in vernal conjunctivitis.}
\end{figure}

Topical steroids are required in severe cases but long-term use is avoided if possible because of the risks of steroid-induced glaucoma or cataract. Mucolytics (acetlycysteine) may be required to help dissolve the corneal plaque but surgery may be required.

Contact lens wearers may develop an allergic reaction to their lenses or to lens cleaning materials, leading to a giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) with a mucoid discharge. Whilst this may respond to topical treatment with mast cell stabilizers, it is often necessary to stop lens wear for a period, or even permanently if symptoms recur.

\section*{Conjunctival degenerations}

Cysts are common in the conjunctiva. They rarely cause symptoms, but if necessary can be removed. Pingueculae and pterygia are found on the interpalpebral bulbar conjunctiva (Figure 7.5). They are thought to result from excessive exposure to the reflected or direct ultraviolet component of sunlight. Histologically the collagen structure is altered. Pingueculae are small, elevated yellowish paralimbal lesions that never impinge on the cornea. Pterygia are

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-117.jpg?height=406&width=1073&top_left_y=1615&top_left_x=278}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 7.5 The clinical appearance of (a) a pinguecula; (b) a pterygium.}
\end{figure}
wing-shaped and located nasally, with the apex towards the cornea, onto which they progressively extend. They may cause irritation and, if extensive, may encroach onto the visual axis. They can be excised but may recur.

\section*{Conjunctival tumours}

These are rare. They include:
- Squamous cell carcinoma. An irregular raised area of conjunctiva which may invade the deeper tissues.
- Malignant melanoma. The differential diagnosis from benign pigmented lesions (for example a naevus or melanosis) may be difficult. Review is necessary to assess whether the lesion is increasing in size. Biopsy, to achieve a definitive diagnosis, may be required.

\section*{Cornea}

\section*{Infective corneal lesions}

\section*{Herpes simplex keratitis}

Type 1 herpes simplex (HSV) is a common and important cause of ocular disease. Type 2, which causes genital disease, may occasionally cause keratitis and infantile chorioretinitis. Primary infection by HSV1 is usually acquired early in life by close contact such as kissing. It may be asymptomatic, but otherwise is accompanied by:
- fever;
- vesicular lid lesions;
- follicular conjunctivitis;
- pre-auricular lymphadenopathy.

Primary infection may cause a conjunctivitis, with or without punctate keratitis. It is followed by resolution and latency of the virus in the trigeminal ganglion. 'Recurrent' infection involves reactivation of the latent virus, which travels centrifugally to nerve terminals in the corneal epithelium to cause an epithelial keratitis. There may be no past clinical history. The risk of reactivation is increased if the patient is debilitated (e.g. systemic illness, immunosuppression). The pathognomonic appearance is of a dendritic ulcer (Figure 7.6). These epithelial ulcers may heal without a scar but they may progress to a stromal keratitis, associated with an inflammatory infiltration and oedema, and ultimately a loss of corneal transparency and permanent scarring. This stage of the disease represents an immunogenic response to the viral antigen. If corneal scarring is severe, a corneal graft may be required to restore vision. Uveitis and glaucoma may accompany the disease. Disciform keratitis is another immunogenic reaction to herpes antigen in the stroma and presents as disc- or ring-shaped stromal oedema and clouding without ulceration, often associated with iritis.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-119.jpg?height=442&width=659&top_left_y=296&top_left_x=484}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 7.6 A dendritic ulcer seen in herpes simplex infection.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Antivirals}

Some of the topical antiviral agents available for ocular therapy:
- Vidarabine.
- Trifluorothymidine.
- Aciclovir.
- Ganciclovir.

Dendritic lesions are treated with topical antivirals and typically heal within 2 weeks. In the UK the standard treatment is with aciclovir. Topical steroids must not be given to patients with a dendritic ulcer, since they may exacerbate the disease and cause extensive corneal ulceration. In patients with stromal involvement (keratitis), steroids are used under ophthalmic supervision and with antiviral cover, to suppress the immunogenic response. Patients undergoing corneal graft surgery for past HSV keratitis commonly receive an extended course of prophylactic, oral antiviral cover to inhibit recurrence.

\section*{Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (ophthalmic shingles)}

This is caused by the varicella zoster virus which is responsible for chickenpox (Figure 7.7). The ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve is affected. Unlike herpes simplex infection, there is usually a prodromal period with the patient systemically unwell. Ocular manifestations are usually preceded by pain and the appearance of vesicles in the distribution of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. Ocular problems are more likely if the nasociliary branch of the nerve is involved (signalled by vesicles at the root of the nose). Signs include:
- lid swelling (which may be bilateral);
- keratitis;

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-120.jpg?height=673&width=533&top_left_y=298&top_left_x=497}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 7.7 The clinical appearance of herpes zoster ophthalmicus.}
\end{figure}
- iritis;
- secondary glaucoma.

Reactivation of the disease is often linked to unrelated systemic illness. Oral antiviral treatment (e.g. aciclovir, famciclovir) is effective in reducing postinfective neuralgia (a severe chronic pain in the area of the rash) if given within 3 days of the skin vesicles erupting. Ocular disease may require treatment with topical steroids and antibacterials to cover secondary infection.

The prognosis of herpetic eye disease has improved since antiviral treatment became available. Both simplex and zoster cause anaesthesia of the cornea. Non-healing indolent ulcers may be seen following simplex infection, and these are difficult to treat.

\section*{Bacterial keratitis}

\section*{Bacteria}

Some of the bacteria responsible for corneal infection:
- Staphylococcus epidermidis.
- Staphylococcus aureus.
- Streptococcus pneumoniae.
- Coliforms.
- Pseudomonas.
- Haemophilus.

\section*{Pathogenesis}

A host of bacteria may infect the cornea. Some are found on the lid margin as part of the normal flora. The conjunctiva and cornea are protected against infection by:
- blinking;
- washing away of debris by the flow of tears;
- entrapment of foreign particles by mucus;
- the antibacterial properties of the tears;
- the barrier function of the corneal epithelium (Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the only organism that can penetrate the intact epithelium).

Predisposing causes of bacterial keratitis include:
- keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye);
- a breach in the corneal epithelium (e.g. following surgery or trauma);
- contact lens wear;
- prolonged use of topical steroids.

\section*{Symptoms and signs}

These include:
- pain, usually severe unless the cornea is anaesthetic;
- purulent discharge;
- ciliary injection;
- visual loss (severe if the visual axis is involved);
- hypopyon - sometimes (a mass of white cells collected in the anterior chamber; see Chapter 9);
- a white corneal opacity which can often be seen with the naked eye (Figure 7.8).

\section*{Treatment}

Scrapes are taken from the base of the ulcer for Gram staining and culture. The patient is then treated with intensive topical antibiotics, often with dual therapy

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-121.jpg?height=444&width=664&top_left_y=1570&top_left_x=481}

\caption{Figure 7.9 The clinical appearance of acanthamoeba keratitis. Arrows indicate neurokeratitis.}
\end{figure}
using specially formulated, concentrated, combined preparations to cover most organisms (e.g. cefuroxime against Gram-positive bacteria and gentamicin for Gram-negative bacteria). The use of fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, available commercially) as a monotherapy is gaining popularity. The drops are given hourly, day and night, for the first couple of days and are reduced in frequency as clinical improvement occurs. In severe or unresponsive disease the cornea may perforate. This can be treated initially with tissue adhesives (cyanoacrylate glue) and a subsequent corneal graft. A persistent scar may also require a corneal graft to restore vision.

\section*{Acanthamoeba keratitis}

This freshwater amoeba is responsible for infective keratitis (Figure 7.9). The infection has become more common with the increasing use of soft contact lenses. A painful keratitis with prominent, infiltrated corneal nerves results. The amoeba can be isolated from the cornea (and from the contact lens case) with a scrape and cultured on special plates impregnated with Escherichia coli. Topical chlorhexidine, polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) and propamidine are used to treat the condition.

\section*{Fungal keratitis}

This is unusual in the UK but more common in warmer climates such as the southern USA. In India it accounts for $30-50 \%$ of infective keratitis. It should be considered in:
- lack of response to antibacterial therapy in corneal ulceration;
- cases of trauma with vegetable matter;
- cases associated with the prolonged use of steroids.

The corneal opacity appears fluffy, and satellite lesions may be present. Liquid and solid Sabouraud's medium is used to grow the fungi. Incubation may need to be prolonged. Treatment requires topical antifungal drops such as pimaricin (natamycin) 5\%.

\section*{Interstitial keratitis}

This term is used for any vascular keratitis that affects the corneal stroma without epithelial involvement. Classically the most common cause was congenital syphilis, leaving a midstromal scar interlaced with the empty ('ghost') blood vessels. Corneal grafting may be required when the opacity is marked and visual acuity reduced.

\section*{Corneal dystrophies}

These are rare inherited disorders. They affect different layers of the cornea and often affect corneal transparency (Figure 7.10). They may be divided into:
- Anterior dystrophies involving the epithelium. These may present with recurrent corneal erosion.
- Stromal dystrophies presenting with visual loss. If very anterior they may cause corneal erosion and pain.
- Posterior dystrophies which affect the endothelium and cause gradual loss of vision due to corneal oedema. They may also cause pain due to epithelial erosion.

\section*{Disorders of shape}

\section*{Keratoconus}

This is usually a sporadic disorder but may occasionally be inherited. Thinning of the centre of the cornea leads to an ectatic, conical corneal shape, with

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-123.jpg?height=442&width=659&top_left_y=1534&top_left_x=484}

\caption{Figure 7.11 Band keratopathy.}
\end{figure}
marked myopia and an irregular astigmatism. Vision is affected but there is no pain. Initially the associated astigmatism can be corrected with glasses and then, as the disease progresses, with contact lenses. The contact lens arches over the irregularly shaped cornea to provide a new, optically perfect anterior surface which restores the optics of the eye. The condition is due to a failure of adhesion between the collagen fibrils of the stroma, responsible for its mechanical strength. Thinning is due to an unravelling process. Current treatment is directed to cross-linking of the stromal collagen, which is achieved by exposing the stroma to UVA radiation in the presence of riboflavin; the generation of free radicals results in cross-linking and inhibits progression of the disease. In severe cases a corneal graft may be required.

\section*{Central corneal degenerations}

\section*{Band keratopathy}

Band keratopathy is the subepithelial deposition of calcium phosphate in the exposed part of the cornea where $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ loss and the consequent raised pH favour its deposition (Figure 7.11). It is seen in eyes with chronic uveitis or glaucoma, and may cause visual loss or discomfort if epithelial erosions form over the band. If symptomatic it can be scraped off surgically, aided by a chelating agent such as sodium edetate. The excimer laser can also be effective in treating these patients by ablating the affected surface. Band keratopathy can also be a sign of systemic hypercalcaemia, as in hyperparathyroidism or renal failure. The lesion is then more likely to occupy the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions of the paralimbal cornea.

\section*{Peripheral corneal degenerations}

\section*{Corneal thinning}

A rare cause of painful peripheral corneal thinning is Mooren's ulcer, a condition of progressive corneal melting with an immune basis which starts near the
limbus and spreads relentlessly across the cornea. Corneal melting can also be seen in collagen diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Wegener's granulomatosis. Treatment can be difficult, and both sets of disorder require systemic and topical immunosuppression and antiproteases. Where there is an associated dry eye it is important to ensure adequate corneal wetting and corneal protection (see Chapter 6).

\section*{Lipid arcus}

This is a peripheral white ring-shaped lipid deposit, separated from the limbus by a clear interval. It is often seen in normal, elderly people (arcus senilis), but in younger patients, under 50 years, it may be a sign of hyperlipoproteinaemia. It does not affect vision and no treatment is required.

\section*{Corneal grafting}

Donor corneal tissue can be grafted into a host cornea to restore corneal clarity or repair a perforation (Figure 7.12). Donor corneas can be stored and are banked so that corneal grafts can be performed on routine operating lists. The avascular condition of the cornea, and additional processes in the cornea and anterior chamber, maintain the host cornea as an immune-privileged site. The cornea possess antiangiogenic mechanisms, and mediators in the anterior chamber suppress immune responsiveness. There is therefore a high success rate for corneal grafting. Tissue can be HLA-typed for grafting of vascularized corneas at high risk of immune rejection, although the value of this is still uncertain. The patient is treated with steroid eye drops for some time after the operation to prevent graft rejection. Complications such as astigmatism can be dealt with surgically or by suture adjustment. Increasingly, methods are being developed that permit only the damaged part of the cornea to be transplanted, for example the endothelial layer when disease of this layer results in corneal oedema.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-125.jpg?height=445&width=664&top_left_y=1531&top_left_x=481}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 7.12 A corneal graft. Note the interrupted and the continuous sutures at the interface between graft and host.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Graft rejection}

Any patient who has had a corneal graft and who complains of redness, pain or visual loss must be seen urgently by an eye specialist, as this may indicate graft rejection. Examination shows graft oedema, iritis and a line of activated T-cells attacking the graft endothelium. Intensive topical steroid application in the early stages can restore graft clarity.

\section*{Sclera}

\section*{Episcleritis}

This inflammation of the superficial layer of the sclera causes mild discomfort. It is rarely associated with systemic disease. It is usually self-limiting but, as symptoms are tiresome, topical anti-inflammatory treatment can be given. In rare, severe disease, systemic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment may be helpful.

\section*{Scleritis}

This is a more severe condition than episcleritis, and may be associated with the collagen vascular diseases, most commonly rheumatoid arthritis, but also polyarteritis nodosa and systemic lupus erythematosis. It is a cause of intense ocular pain. Both inflammatory areas and ischaemic areas of the sclera may occur. Characteristically the affected sclera is swollen (Figure 7.13). The following may complicate the condition:
- scleral thinning (scleromalacia), sometimes with perforation;
- keratitis;
- uveitis;

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-126.jpg?height=442&width=659&top_left_y=1534&top_left_x=434}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 7.13 The appearance of scleritis.}
\end{figure}
- cataract formation;
- glaucoma.

Treatment may require high doses of systemic steroids, or in severe cases cytotoxic therapy and investigation to find any associated systemic disease.

Scleritis affecting the posterior part of the globe may cause choroidal effusions, or may simulate a tumour.

\section*{KEY POINTS}
- Avoid the unsupervised use of topical steroids in treating ophthalmic conditions, since complications may be serious.
- In contact lens wearers a painful red eye is serious; it may imply an infective keratitis.
- Redness, pain and reduced vision in a patient with corneal graft suggest rejection, which is an ophthalmic emergency.
- Good hygiene and hand washing is vital if contact with an adenoviral conjunctivitis is suspected to prevent spread.

\section*{PAEDIATRIC OPHTHALMOLOGY}
- Ophthalmia neonatorum, which refers to any conjunctivitis that occurs in the first 28 days of neonatal life, is a notifiable disease requiring urgent treatment. Swabs for culture are mandatory.

\section*{Answers}
1. An 11-year-old child presents with a red watery eye and slightly blurred vision.
a False. While the symptom of redness fits, the watering and similar symptoms experienced by her sister suggest that an infection is more likely.
b True. The symptoms are typical of an adenovirus conjunctivitis, a condition which is highly contagious.
c False. The discharge would be mucopurulent.
d False. While steroids can help the corneal complications of adenovirus infection, they are difficult to wean. Also, you would wish to exclude a herpes simplex infection before considering their use.
e False. These elevations are called 'follicles' and are composed of lymphoid cells.

\section*{2. A 26-year-old patient presents with an itchy watery eye.}
a False. The inflammation is not localized at the limbus, papillae are present, and there is an opaque corneal plaque on the cornea.
b False. The corneal lesion does not resemble a dendritic ulcer.
c True. The redness, papillae and corneal lesion are typical of severe vernal keratoconjunctivitis.
d True. This is a serious condition that may affect the long-term clarity of the cornea. Mucolytic drops are also given to remove help dissolve the corneal plaque.
e False. Aciclovir is an antiviral agent used in the treatment of herpes simplex keratitis.

\section*{3. A $\mathbf{6 7}$-year-old lady presents with pain on the right side of her forehead.}
a False. Vesicles would not be a feature of the disease in this age group.
b True. This is a classical presentation.
c False. The skin is not affected in acanthamoeba keratitis.
d True. The effects on the eye can be widespread, see page 105.
e True. If this is given in the first 3 days of the disease it can reduce symptoms and help prevent severe post-herpetic neuralgia.

\section*{4. A contact lens wearer presents with a red painful eye.}
a True. Contact lens wear is the commonest risk factor in the developed world. Other causes are trauma, prolonged steroid use, dry eye and an anaesthetic cornea (as seen in herpetic eye disease).
b True. The eye is usually very painful.
c False. These rarely cause a red painful eye.
d False. Band keratopathy is caused by a deposition of calcium salts in the superficial cornea. It may sometimes cause a red painful eye, but the appearance differs.
e True. This is an ophthalmic emergency.

\section*{5. A 24-year-old lady presents with a red eye.}
a False. There is no discharge and injection is not usually localized in conjunctivitis.
b False. Keratoconus is a disorder of corneal shape and occurs in a white eye.
c True. The symptoms and signs are very suggestive.
d False. The diagnosis is possible but less likely than episcleritis. Scleritis causes a deep, boring pain.
e True. Simple episcleritis is self-limiting. Nodular episcleritis may be helped by topical anti-inflammatory agents. If there is a lack of response, a systemic NSAID (e.g. flurbiprofen) may be used.

\section*{The lens and cataract}

\section*{Learning objectives}

\section*{To understand:}
$\checkmark$ The symptoms, signs, pathology and causes of cataract.
$\checkmark$ The reasons for undertaking cataract surgery.
$\checkmark$ The principles of cataract surgery.
$\checkmark$ The complications of cataract surgery.

\section*{Introduction}

The lens is a biconvex and perfectly transparent organ, held in position behind the iris by the suspensory ligament (zonule), whose fibres are composed of the protein fibrillin. The zonule attaches the equator of the lens to the ciliary body. Disease may affect structure, shape and position of the lens.

\section*{Cataract}

\section*{Definition and causes of cataract}

Cataract is the name given to any light-scattering opacity within the lens wherever it is located. When it lies on the visual axis or is extensive, it gives rise to visual loss. Cataract is the commonest cause of treatable blindness in the world. The large majority of cataracts occur in older subjects, as a result of cumulative exposure to environmental and other influences, such as smoking, UV radiation and elevated blood sugar levels. This is referred to as age-related cataract.

Age of onset is lower in countries with the highest prevalence of cataract, reflecting the influence of special cataractogenic factors. A smaller number are associated with specific ocular or systemic disease and defined physicochemical mechanisms. Some are congenital and may be inherited.

\section*{Ocular conditions associated with cataract}
- Trauma.
- Uveitis.
- High myopia.
- Topical medication (particularly steroid eye drops).
- Intraocular tumour.

\section*{Symptoms}

A cataract of sufficient degree causes:
- a painless loss of vision;
- glare;
- in some instances, a change in refraction.

In infants, cataract causes amblyopia (a failure of visual maturation) by depriving the retina of a formed image at a critical stage of visual development. Infants with suspected cataract or a family history of congenital cataracts should be assessed by an ophthalmologist shortly after birth, as a matter of urgency (see Congenital cataract, below).

\section*{Signs}

Visual acuity is reduced. In some patients the acuity, measured in a dark room, may seem satisfactory, but if the same test is carried out in bright light or sunlight, the acuity falls, as a result of glare and loss of contrast. Also, small pupils in bright light may restrict light entry.

A cataract appears black against the red reflex when the eye is examined with a direct ophthalmoscope (see Chapter 2). Slit-lamp examination allows the cataract to be examined in detail, and the exact site of the opacity in the lens can be identified. Age-related cataract is commonly nuclear, cortical or subcapsular in location (Figure 8.1). Steroid-induced cataract is commonly posterior subcapsular. Other features to suggest an ocular cause for the cataract may be found, for example pigment deposition on the lens suggesting previous inflammation, or damage to the iris suggesting previous ocular trauma (Figure 8.2).

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 8.1 The location of different types of cataract.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Systemic causes of cataract}
- Diabetes.
- Other metabolic disorders (including galactosaemia, hypocalcaemia, Fabry disease).
- Systemic drugs (particularly steroids, chlorpromazine).
- Infection (congenital rubella).
- Myotonic dystrophy.
- Atopic dermatitis.
- Systemic syndromes (Down's, Lowe's).
- Congenital, including inherited, cataract.
- X-radiation.

\section*{Investigation}

This is required if systemic disease is suspected or if the cataract is congenital or appears at an early age.

\section*{Treatment}

Although much effort has been directed towards slowing the progression of, or preventing cataract, management remains surgical. There is no need to wait for the cataract to 'ripen' and cause major visual loss. The test is whether or not the cataract produces sufficient visual symptoms to reduce the quality of life. Patients may have difficulty in recognizing faces, reading, carrying out their occupation or achieving the driving standard. Some patients may be greatly troubled by glare. Prior to surgery patients must be informed of any coexisting eye disease which may influence the outcome of cataract surgery and the visual prognosis.

\section*{Cataract surgery}

The operation (Figure 8.3) requires access to the lens substance via an opening in the anterior part of the lens capsule, removal of most of the lens fibres and

\caption{Figure 8.3 Stages in the removal of a cataract and the placement of an intraocular lens. (a) An incision is made in the cornea or anterior sclera. A small, stepped self-sealing incision is made for phacoemulsification and a wider, limbal incision, for extracapsular surgery (ECCE). (b) A circular disc of the anterior capsule is removed. In ECCE a ring of small incisions is made with a needle to perforate the capsule, allowing the central portion to be removed. In phacoemulsification the capsule is torn in a circle leaving a strong smooth edge to the remaining anterior capsule. A cannula is then placed under the anterior capsule and fluid injected to separate the lens nucleus from the cortex, allowing the nucleus to be rotated within the capsular bag. (c) In ECCE the hard nucleus of the lens is removed through the incision, by expression. Pressure on the eye causes the nucleus to pass out through the incision. (d) Alternatively the nucleus can be emulsified in situ. The phacoemulsification probe, introduced through the small corneal or scleral incision, shaves away the nucleus. (e) The remaining soft lens matter is aspirated, leaving only the posterior capsule and the peripheral part of the anterior capsule. (f) An intraocular lens is implanted into the remains of the capsule. To allow implantation through the small phacoemulsification wound, the lens must be folded in half or injected through a special introducer into the eye. The incision is repaired with fine nylon sutures. If phacoemulsification has been used the incision in the eye is smaller and a suture is usually not required.}

epithelial cells, and insertion of a plastic lens implant of appropriate optical power. The implant is held in place within the 'capsular bag'.

Surgery is increasingly performed under local rather than general anaesthesia. Local anaesthetic is infiltrated around the globe and lids or given topically. Usually the patient can attend as a day case, without admission to hospital, returning home shortly after surgery.

The operation can be performed:
- By emulsification of the lens, using an ultrasound probe introduced through a smaller incision at the limbus (phacoemulsification or 'phaco'). (Figure 8.3d). Usually no suture is required. This is now the preferred method in the Western world.
- Alternatively, through an extended incision at the limbus, followed by extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) (Figure 8.3c). Here, after opening the capsule, the bulk of the lens substance is expressed from the eye with gentle pressure and residual material is aspirated with a cannula. The incision must be sutured and the sutures removed postoperatively.

The optical power of the lens implant is calculated prior to surgery by measuring the length of the eye ultrasonically and the curvature of the cornea (and thus its optical power) optically (keratometry). The power of the lens is generally calculated to provide good distance acuity without glasses (i.e. emmetropia). The choice of implant power is influenced by the refraction of the fellow eye and whether it too has a cataract which will require surgery. Where surgery on the fellow eye is likely to be delayed, it is important that the patient is not left with a major difference in the refractive state of the two eyes (aniseikonia), since the difference in retinal image size may not be tolerated visually.

Postoperatively the patient is given a short course of steroid and antibiotic drops. New glasses, if required, can be prescribed after a few weeks, once the incision has healed. Visual rehabilitation and the prescription of new glasses is much quicker after phacoemulsification. Since the patient cannot accommodate, a spectacle correction will be required postoperatively for close work even if it is not needed for distance. Multifocal intraocular lenses, which provide good distance and near vision without glasses, are now in use, although there may be a reduction in contrast sensitivity with these lenses.

Surgery may sometimes induce a degree of corneal astigmatism. Where sutures were used their postoperative removal may reduce this. This is done prior to measuring the patient for new glasses but after the wound has healed and steroid drops have been stopped. Excessive corneal curvature can be induced in the line of a tight suture. Removal usually solves this problem and is easily accomplished in the clinic under local anaesthetic with the patient sitting at the slit lamp. Loose sutures must be removed to prevent infection but it may be necessary to resuture the incision if healing is imperfect. Sutureless phacoemulsification through a smaller incision avoids these complications. Furthermore, a modified entry site or relaxing incisions at the periphery of the cornea may allow correction of pre-existing astigmatism. Pre-existing corneal astigmatism can also be treated with toric intraocular lenses, which incorporate the astigmatic correction.

\section*{Complications of cataract surgery}

1 Vitreous loss. If the posterior capsule is damaged during the operation the vitreous gel may come forward into the anterior chamber, where it represents a risk for glaucoma or may cause retinal traction. The gel requires careful aspiration and excision (vitrectomy) at the time of surgery and placement of the intraocular lens may need to be deferred to a secondary procedure.
2 Iris prolapse. The iris may protrude through the surgical incision in the immediate postoperative period. It appears as a dark area at the incision site. The pupil is distorted. This requires prompt surgical repair.
3 Endophthalmitis. A serious but rare infective complication of cataract extraction (less than $0.3 \%$ ). Patients present, usually within a few days of surgery, with:
a a painful red eye;
b reduced visual acuity;
c a collection of white cells in the anterior chamber (hypopyon).
This is an extreme ophthalmic emergency. The patient requires urgent sampling of the aqueous and vitreous for microbiological analysis and an intravitreal, broad-spectrum, antibiotic injection at the time of sampling (e.g. vancomycin and ceftazidime) to provide immediate cover. Further injections are dependent on the microbiological report and clinical response. In some instances topical and systemic antibiotics are used in addition.
4 Cystoid macular oedema. The macula may become oedematous following surgery, particularly if surgery was accompanied by vitreous loss or followed by inflammation. It may settle with time but can produce a severe reduction in acuity. Inflammatory prostaglandin release may play a part in this and prompt treatment with topical NSAIDs and steroid can alleviate the oedema in a proportion of patients. Sometimes it may require treatment with steroids injected into or around the eye.
5 Retinal detachment. Modern techniques of cataract extraction are associated with a low rate of this complication. It is increased if there has been vitreous loss. The symptoms, signs and management are described in Chapter 11.
6 Opacification of the posterior capsule (Figure 8.4). Normally, the thin capsular layer, lying behind the implant, is crystal clear. However, in approximately $20 \%$ of patients clarity of the posterior capsule decreases in the months following surgery, when residual epithelial cells migrate across its surface to form an opaque scar. Vision becomes blurred and there may be problems with glare. A small opening can be made in the capsule with a laser (neodymium yttrium garnet (ndYAG) laser) as an outpatient procedure. There is a small risk of cystoid macular oedema or retinal detachment following YAG capsulotomy. Research aimed at reducing this complication has shown that the lens implant material, the shape of the edge of the lens and overlap of the intraocular lens by a small rim of anterior capsule are important in preventing posterior capsule opacification.
7 If the fine nylon sutures are not removed after surgery they may break in the following months or years, causing irritation or infection. Symptoms are cured by removal.

\caption{Figure 8.4 (a) An opacified posterior capsule. (b) The result of laser capsulotomy.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Congenital cataract}

The presence of congenital or infantile cataract is a threat to sight, not only because of the immediate obstruction to vision but because disturbance of the retinal image impairs visual maturation in the infant and leads to amblyopia and squint (see Chapter 15). If bilateral cataract is present and has a significant effect on retinal image formation this will cause amblyopia, squint and an oscillation of the eyes (nystagmus). Both cataractous lenses require urgent surgery and the fitting of contact lenses to correct the aphakia. The management of contact lenses requires considerable input and motivation from the parents of the child.

The treatment of uniocular congenital cataract remains controversial. Unfortunately the results of surgery are disappointing and vision may improve little because amblyopia develops despite adequate optical correction with a contact lens. To maximize the chances of success, treatment must be performed within the first few weeks of life and be accompanied by a coordinated patching routine to the fellow eye to stimulate visual maturation in the amblyopic eye and minimize the risk of squint. Increasingly, intraocular lenses are being implanted in children over 2 years old. The eye becomes increasingly myopic as the child grows, however, making the choice of lens implant power difficult. There is a significant risk of subsequent glaucoma developing in patients undergoing surgery for congenital cataract, particularly when this is performed prior to 1 year of age.

\section*{Change in lens shape}

Abnormal lens shape is very unusual. The curvature of the anterior part of the lens may be increased centrally (anterior lenticonus) in Alport's syndrome, a recessively inherited condition of deafness and nephropathy. An abnormally small lens may be associated with short stature and other skeletal abnormalities.

\section*{Change in lens position (ectopia lentis)}

Weakness of the zonule causes lens displacement. The lens takes up a more rounded form and the eye becomes more myopic. This may be seen in:
- trauma;
- inborn errors of metabolism (e.g. homocystinuria, a recessive disorder with mental defect and skeletal features - the lens is usually displaced downwards);
- certain syndromes (e.g. Marfan syndrome, a dominant disorder with skeletal and cardiac abnormalities and a risk of dissecting aortic aneurysm - the lens is usually displaced upwards). There is a defect in the zonular protein due to a mutation in the fibrillin gene.

The irregular myopia can be corrected optically, although sometimes an aphakic correction may be required if the lens is substantially displaced from the visual axis. Surgical removal may be indicated, particularly if the displaced lens has caused a secondary glaucoma, but surgery may result in further complications.

\section*{Cataract - the world perspective}

In the developed world cataract surgery is performed when visual symptoms interfere with the quality of life. Worldwide there are in excess of 20 million people blind due to dense bilateral cataract (for more detail see Chapter 17). This represents a huge cause of preventable blindness. Cataract is a major focus of the Vision 2020 project, a joint initiative of the World Health Organization and the International Association for the Blind. The goal is to remove cataract as a cause of blindness by the year 2020.

\section*{KEY POINTS}
- In adult cataract, extraction is indicated if the reduction in vision is interfering with the patient's quality of life.

\section*{PAEDIATRIC OPHTHALMOLOGY}
- An infant with a family history of congenital cataract or a suspected cataract must be seen by an ophthalmologist as a matter of urgency.
- There is a significant risk of glaucoma developing in patients following congenital catract surgery at an early age.

\section*{Uveitis}

\section*{Learning objectives}

\section*{To understand:}
$\checkmark$ The definition of uveitis and the ocular structures involved.
$\checkmark$ The symptoms, signs, causes and treatment of uveitis.

\section*{Introduction}

Inflammation of the uveal tract (the iris, ciliary body and choroid) has many causes and is termed uveitis (Figure 9.1). It is usual for structures adjacent to the inflamed uveal tissue to become involved in the inflammatory process. It may be classified anatomically:
- Inflammation of the iris, accompanied by increased vascular permeability, is termed iritis or anterior uveitis (Figure 9.2). White cells circulating in the aqueous humour of the anterior chamber can be seen with a slit lamp. Protein, which also leaks into the anterior chamber from the blood vessels, is picked out by its light-scattering properties in the beam of the slit lamp as a 'flare'.
- An inflammation of the ciliary body is termed cyclitis, of the pars plana is pars planitis and of the vitreous is vitritis. As a group these are termed intermediate uveitis.
- Inflammation of the posterior uvea is termed posterior uveitis and may involve the choroid (choroiditis), the retina (retinitis) or both (chorioretinitis).
- A panuveitis is present when inflammatory changes affect the anterior chamber, vitreous and retina and/or the choroid.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 9.1 External ocular appearance in a patient with anterior uveitis. Note the inflammatory response at the limbus.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Epidemiology}

The incidence of uveitis is about 15 per 100000 people. About $75 \%$ of these are anterior uveitis.

About $50 \%$ of patients with uveitis have an associated systemic disease.

\section*{History}

The patient may complain of:
- ocular pain (less frequent with posterior uveitis or choroiditis);
- photophobia;
- blurring of vision;
- redness of the eye.

Posterior uveitis may, however, not be painful.
The patient must be questioned about other relevant symptoms that may help determine whether or not there is an associated systemic disease:
- Respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and the nature of any sputum produced (associated sarcoidosis or tuberculosis).
- Skin problems. Erythema nodosum (painful raised red lesions on the arms and shins) may be present in granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis and Behçet's disease. Patients with Behçet's may also have thrombophlebitis, dermatographia and oral and genital ulceration. Psoriasis (in association with arthritis) may be accompanied by uveitis.
- Joint disease. Ankylosing spondylitis with back pain is associated with acute anterior uveitis. In children juvenile chronic arthritis may be associated with uveitis. Reiter's disease (classically urethritis, conjunctivitis and a seronegative arthritis) may also be associated with anterior uveitis.

\end{figure}
- Bowel disease. Occasionally uveitis may be associated with inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and Whipple's disease.
- Infectious disease. Syphilis with its protean manifestations can cause uveitis (particularly posterior choroiditis). Herpetic disease (herpes simplex and zoster) may also cause uveitis. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) may cause uveitis, particularly in patients with AIDS. Fungal infections and metastatic infections may also cause uveitis, usually in immunocompromised patients.

\section*{Signs}

On examination:
- The visual acuity may be reduced.
- The eye will be inflamed, mostly around the limbus (ciliary injection).

\section*{Anterior uveitis}
- Inflammatory cells may be visible clumped together on the endothelium of the cornea, particularly inferiorly (keratitic precipitates or KPs).
- Slit-lamp examination will reveal aqueous cells and a flare due to exuded protein. If the inflammation is severe there may be sufficient white cells to collect as a fluid level inferiorly (hypopyon).
- The vessels on the iris may be dilated.
- The iris may adhere to the lens and bind down the pupil (posterior synechiae or $P S$ ). Peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) between the iris and the trabecular meshwork or cornea may occlude the drainage angle.
- The intraocular pressure may be elevated by PAS or increased aqueous protein.

\section*{Intermediate and posterior uveitis}
- There may be cells in the vitreous.
- There may be retinal or choroidal foci of inflammation (Figure 9.3).
- Macular oedema may be present (see Chapter 11).

\section*{Investigations}

These are aimed at determining a systemic association and are directed in part by the type of uveitis present. An anterior uveitis is more likely to be associated with ankylosing spondylitis, and human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typing may help confirm the diagnosis. The presence of large KPs and possibly nodules on the iris may suggest sarcoidosis: a chest radiograph, serum calcium and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels would be appropriate. In toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis the focus of inflammation often occurs at the margin of an old inflammatory choroidal scar. A posterior uveitis may have an infectious or systemic inflammatory cause. Some diseases such as CMV infections in HIV-positive patients have a characteristic appearance, and with an appropriate history may require no further diagnostic tests. Associated symptoms may also point towards a systemic disease (e.g. fever, diarrhoea, weight loss). Not all cases of anterior uveitis require investigation at first presentation unless associated systemic symptoms are present.

\section*{Treatment}

This is aimed at:
- suppressing inflammation in the eye, and relieving pain in anterior uveitis;
- preventing damage to ocular structures, particularly to the macula and the optic nerve, which may lead to permanent visual loss.

Steroid therapy is the mainstay of treatment. In anterior uveitis this is delivered by eye drops. However, topical steroids do not effectively penetrate to the posterior segment. Posterior uveitis is therefore treated with systemic steroids, or with steroids injected onto the orbital floor or into the sub-Tenon's space (Figure 9.4).

In anterior uveitis, dilating the pupil relieves the pain from ciliary spasm and prevents the formation of posterior synechiae by separating it from the anterior lens capsule. Synechiae otherwise interfere with normal dilation of the pupil. Dilation is achieved with mydriatics, e.g. cyclopentolate or atropine drops. Atropine has a prolonged action lasting weeks. An attempt to break any synechiae that have formed should be made with initial intensive cyclopentolate and phenylephrine drops. A subconjunctival injection of mydriatics may help to break resistant synechiae.

In posterior uveitis/retinitis visual loss may occur either from destructive processes caused by the retinitis itself (e.g. in toxoplasmosis or CMV infection) or from fluid accumulation in the layers of the macula (macular oedema). Apart from systemic or injected steroids, specific antiviral or antibiotic medication may also be required. Some rare but severe forms of uveitis, e.g. that associated with Behçet's disease, may require treatment with other systemic immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine or ciclosporin. Long-term treatment may be necessary.

\section*{Specific conditions associated with uveitis}

There is a large number of systemic diseases associated with uveitis. A few of the more common ones are outlined in Table 9.1.

\section*{Ankylosing spondylitis}

This is a seronegative (rheumatoid factor negative) spondyloarthropathy causing inflammation of the tendons, ligaments and joints of the spine. Untreated, the condition leads to a disabling, gross rigidity and flexion deformity of the spine. Genetic factors are involved in the disease. Ninety per cent of patients with uveitis have the tissue type HLA B27, although the prevalence of the disease in people in general with HLA B27 is only $1 \%$. Approximately $20 \%$

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 9.1 Some causes of uveitis (not an exhaustive list).}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Infectious & Non-infectious ocular disease & Systemic disease-associated \\
\hline Toxoplasmosis & Sympathetic ophthalmitis & Juvenile chronic arthritis \\
\hline Herpes simplex & Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis & Ankylosing spondylosis \\
\hline CMV (AIDS) & Angle closure glaucoma & Psoriatic arthritis \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
of patients with ankylosing spondylitis will develop acute anterior uveitis. Males are affected more frequently than females ( $3: 1$ ).

\section*{History}

Recurrent anterior uveitis may be the presenting feature of this condition. Close enquiry will usually reveal an insidious history of low backache, typically worse on waking and relieved by exercise. Stiffness at rest is a useful symptom which helps differentiate the condition from disease of the intervertebral discs. The peripheral joints may be affected in a minority of patients.

\section*{Signs}

These are typical of an anterior uveitis.

\section*{Investigation}

The presence of symptoms and signs in an HLA B27-positive individual is indicative. Sacroiliac spinal MRI may detect early changes in the sacroiliac joints and radiographs may reveal the classical features of the disease (Figure 9.5).

\section*{Treatment}

Treatment of the arthropathy is with painkillers, disease modifying drugs, NSAIDs, physiotherapy and biologics such as etanercept and adalimumab which are directed against the action of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF$\alpha$ ). Ocular treatment is as previously outlined. The patient will benefit from a rheumatological opinion and may require intermittent anti-inflammatory treatment and physiotherapy.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 9.5 MRI appearance of (a) the spine and (b) the fused sacroiliac joints of a patient with ankylosing spondylitis.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Prognosis}

Patients may experience recurrent attacks. The outlook for vision is good if the acute attacks are treated early and vigorously.

\section*{Reiter's disease}

This condition predominantly affects males, nearly all of whom are HLA B27positive. It comprises:
- urethritis;
- arthritis (typically of the large joints);
- conjunctivitis.

Some $40 \%$ of patients develop acute anterior uveitis.

\section*{Juvenile chronic arthritis}

A seronegative arthritis (negative for rheumatoid factor) which presents in children, either as a systemic disease with fevers and lymphadenopathy, or as a pauciarticular or polyarticular arthritis. The pauciarticular form has the higher risk of chronic anterior uveitis, particularly if the patient is positive for antinuclear antibodies.

\section*{History}

The anterior uveitis is chronic and usually asymptomatic. A profound visual defect may be discovered by chance if lens or retinal damage caused by chronic uveitis has developed slowly.

\section*{Signs}

The eye is white (unusual for iritis), but other signs of an anterior uveitis are present. Because the uveitis is chronic, cataract may occur and patients may develop glaucoma, either as a result of the uveitis or as a result of the steroid drops used to treat the condition. Macular oedema may also occur. Approximately $70 \%$ of cases show bilateral involvement.

\section*{Investigation}

Rheumatoid factor is negative but patients frequently have a positive antinuclear antibody.

\section*{Treatment}

Ocular treatment is as previously outlined. Patients may be put on systemic treatment for the joint disease. It is important to screen children with juvenile arthritis regularly for uveitis, as they are otherwise asymptomatic unless potentially blinding complications occur. Glaucoma can be very difficult to treat, and, if medical treatment fails to control pressure, it may require surgery.

\section*{Fuchs' heterochromic uveitis}

This is a rare chronic uveitis usually found in young adults. The cause is uncertain, it may be immune mediated and there are no systemic associations.

\section*{History}

The patient does not usually present with a typical history of iritis. Blurred vision and floaters may be the initial complaint.

\section*{Signs}

A mild anterior uveitis is present, but without signs of conjunctival inflammation, and there are no posterior synechiae. There are KPs distributed diffusely over the cornea. The iris is heterochromic due to loss of some of the pigment epithelial cells. The vitreous may be inflamed and condensations (the cause of the floaters) may be present. About $70 \%$ of patients develop cataract. Glaucoma occurs to a lesser extent.

\section*{Treatment}

Steroids are not effective in controlling the inflammation and are thus not prescribed. Patients usually respond well to cataract surgery when it is required. The glaucoma is treated conventionally.

\section*{Toxoplasmosis}

\section*{History}

The infection may be congenital or acquired. Most ocular toxoplasmosis was thought to be congenital, with the resulting retinochoroiditis being reactivated in adult life. However, there is now evidence that it is often acquired during a glandular fever-like illness. The patient may complain of hazy vision and floaters, and the eye may be red and painful.

\section*{Signs}

The retina is the principal structure involved, with secondary inflammation occurring in the choroid (retinochoroiditis). An active lesion is often located at the posterior pole, appearing as a creamy focus of inflammatory cells at the margin of an old chorioretinal scar (such scars are usually atrophic, with a pigmented edge) (Figure 9.6). Inflammatory cells cause a vitreous haze, and the anterior chamber may also show evidence of inflammation.

\section*{Investigation}

The clinical appearance is usually diagnostic, but a positive anti-toxoplasma antibody test is suggestive. However, a high percentage of the population have positive IgG titres due to prior infection.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-153.jpg?height=510&width=1073&top_left_y=1328&top_left_x=276}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 9.6 The appearance of (a) an inactive toxoplasma retinitis and (b) a reactivated lesion. The active lesion appears pale with indistinct edges; it lies above the inactive one.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Treatment}

Reactivated lesions will subside, but treatment is required if the macula or optic nerve is threatened or if the inflammatory response is very severe. Systemic steroids are administered with antiprotozoal drugs such as clindamycin and sulphadiazine, sometimes used in combination. Patients taking clindamycin must be warned that if diarrhoea develops they should seek medical help immediately as this may indicate the development of pseudomembranous colitis, a side effect of the drug.

\section*{Behçet's and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada diseases}

There are two form of uveitis which are seen infrequently in western countries but make an important contribution to the prevalence of uveitis in the Middle East, Asia and also in Japan. The prevalence of the disease is these countries is in the order of 8 per 10, 000 .

\section*{Behçet's disease}

Behçet's disease is a condition that causes wide-ranging symptoms including mouth ulcers, genital ulcers and a hypopyon anterior uveitis. Additional central nervous system (CNS), genito-urinary, gastrointestinal (GI) and skin problems and thrombosis also occur. The disease is due to an arteritis of the small blood vessels. The protean nature of the disease may require the support of several different specialists. As it is most common in Mediterranean countries, Turkey, the Middle East, Japan and south-east Asia it has sometimes been called the Silk Route disease, after the ancient trade routes that ran through these areas.

\section*{Treatment}

Colchicine tablets are often prescribed for mouth or genital ulcers, and dapsone may also be effective. There are also treatments that can be applied locally to the ulcers.

Immunosuppressives are the usual treatment for moderate to severe Behçet's syndrome, e.g. azathioprine, and also ciclosporin, tacrolimus and mycophenolate. These agents act as steroid-sparing drugs. Anti-TNF drugs may be effective. Interferon alpha is currently under evaluation.

\section*{Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease.}

Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH) is a multisystem disorder presenting with a bilateral panuveitis with exudative retinal detachments and followed by neurological and cutaneous manifestations such as baldness and loss of lash and skin pigments (poliosis and vitiligo). It is a cell-mediated autoimmune disease probably directed against tyrosinase-related proteins, TRP1 and TRP2 contained in melanocytes. VKH is more common in females than males ( $2: 1$ ) and affects individuals aged 20-50 years, although it has been reported in children as young as 4 years. VKH disease occurs most commonly in patients with
a genetic predisposition to the disease, including Asian, Middle Eastern, Hispanic, and Native American populations. Several HLA associations have been found in patients with VKH disease, including HLA-DR4, HLA-DR53 and HLA-DQ4.

A prodromal stage, with fever, headache, tinnitus and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, is followed after several days by a posterior uveitis leading to bilateral serous detachments. There is also a vigorous granulomatous, anterior uveitis with mutton fat KP. After several weeks the detachments subside and there is both depigmentation of the choroid and hyperpigmentation of the retina. Skin changes include vitiligo and poliosis of the lashes, eyebrows and hair, with the vitiligo distributed symmetrically over the head, eyelids and trunk.

\section*{AIDS and CMV retinitis}

Ocular disease is a common manifestation of AIDS. Patients develop a variety of ocular conditions:
- microvascular occlusion causing retinal haemorrhages and cotton-wool spots (axonal swelling proximal to infarcted areas of the retinal nerve fibre layer);
- corneal endothelial deposits;
- neoplasms of the eye and orbit;
- neuro-ophthalmic disorders including oculomotor palsies;
- opportunistic infections, of which the most common is CMV retinitis (previously seen in more than one-third of AIDS patients, but the population at risk has decreased significantly since the advent of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) in the treatment of AIDS). It typically occurs in patients with a blood CD4+ cell count of less than $50 / \mathrm{ml}$. Toxoplasmosis, herpes simplex and herpes zoster are among other infections that may be seen.

\section*{History}

The patient may complain of blurred vision or floaters. A diagnosis of HIV disease has usually already been made and other AIDS-defining features may have presented.

\section*{Signs}

CMV retinopathy comprises a whitish area of retina, associated with haemorrhage, which has been likened in appearance to 'cottage cheese' (Figure 9.7). The lesions may threaten the macula or the optic disc. There is usually an associated sparse inflammation of the vitreous.

\section*{Treatment}

Chronic therapy with ganciclovir and/or foscarnet given parenterally is the current mainstay of therapy; these drugs may also be given into the vitreous

\begin{figure}

cavity. Cidofivir is available for intravenous administration. Ganciclovir and its prodrug valganciclovir are available orally. Intraocular depot systems for the long-term delivery of anti-CMV agents into the vitreous are under active development, and a ganciclovir implant is available.

\section*{Prognosis}

Prolonged treatment is required to prevent recurrence.

\section*{Sympathetic ophthalmitis}

This is a devastating complication of ocular injury. A penetrating or surgical injury to one eye involving the retina may rarely excite a peculiar form of uveitis which involves not only the injured eye but also the fellow eye. This is termed sympathetic ophthalmitis. The uveitis may be so severe that in the worst cases sight may be lost from both eyes. Fortunately systemic steroids, and particularly ciclosporin, have greatly improved the chances of conserving vision. Sympathetic ophthalmitis usually develops within 3 months of the injury or last ocular operation but may occur at any time. The cause appears to be an immune response against retinal antigens at the time of injury. It can be prevented by enucleation (removal) of the traumatized eye shortly after the injury (within a week or so) if the prospects for visual potential in that eye are very
poor and there is major disorganization. Excision must precede the onset of signs in the fellow eye.

\section*{Symptoms}

The patient may complain of pain and decreased vision in the uninjured fellow eye.

\section*{Signs}

The iris appears swollen, and yellow-white spots may be seen on the retina. There is a panuveitis.

\section*{Treatment}

High-dose systemic and topical steroids, and also oral ciclosporin, are required to reduce the inflammation and to prevent long-term visual loss. It is vital to warn patients with ocular trauma or multiple eye operations to attend an eye casualty department if they experience any problems with their normal eye.

\section*{KEY POINTS}
- Angle closure glaucoma may cause an anterior uveitis and may present with similar symptoms. Look for a dilated pupil and check the intraocular pressure.
- Patients with a retinal detachment may occasionally present with an anterior uveitis. The retina should always be examined in patients with uveitis.
- Active treatment of uveitis is required to prevent long-term complications.

\section*{PAEDIATRIC OPHTHALMOLOGY}
- Children with juvenile arthritis require regular screening to exclude the presence of uveitis, as it is usually asymptomatic.

\section*{Glaucoma}

\section*{Learning objectives}

To understand:
$\checkmark$ The nature of glaucoma.
$\checkmark$ The difference between primary and secondary glaucoma; open and closed angle glaucoma.
$\checkmark$ The different symptoms and signs of open and closed angle glaucoma.
$\checkmark$ The three major forms of glaucoma therapy.

\section*{Introduction}

The glaucomas are a group of diseases causing damage to the optic nerve (optic neuropathy) by the effects of raised ocular pressure on the optic nerve head. Independent ischaemia of the optic nerve head may also be important. Axon loss results in visual field defects and a loss of visual acuity if the central visual field is involved.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The intraocular pressure level is determined by a balance between production and removal of aqueous humour (Figure 10.1). Aqueous is actively secreted into

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-161.jpg?height=517&width=666&top_left_y=294&top_left_x=479}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 10.1 Diagram of the drainage angle, showing routes taken by aqueous from production to absorption.}
\end{figure}
the posterior chamber by the ciliary processes, by a combination of active transport and ultrafiltration. It then passes through the pupil into the anterior chamber and leaves the eye, predominantly, via the trabecular meshwork, Schlemm's canal and the episcleral veins to reach the bloodstream (the conventional pathway). A small but important proportion of the aqueous (4\%) drains across the ciliary body into the supra-choroidal space and is absorbed into the venous circulation (the uveoscleral pathway).

Two theories have been advanced to explain how elevated intraocular pressure, acting at the nerve head, damages the optic nerve fibres:

1 Raised intraocular pressure causes mechanical damage to the axons.
2 Raised intraocular pressure causes ischaemia of the nerve axons by reducing blood flow at the nerve head.
The pathophysiology of glaucoma is probably multifactorial and both mechanisms are important.

\section*{Classification}

The mechanism by which aqueous drainage is reduced provides a means to classify the glaucomas. Classification of the primary glaucomas (Figure 10.2) is based on whether or not the peripheral iris is:
- clear of the trabecular meshwork (open angle glaucoma);
- covering the meshwork (closed angle glaucoma).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-162.jpg?height=768&width=662&top_left_y=296&top_left_x=434}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 10.2 Diagram showing the difference between open and closed angle glaucoma. Outflow resistance is increased in each case. In open angle glaucoma the obstruction is due to structural changes in the trabecular meshwork. In closed angle glaucoma the peripheral iris blocks the meshwork.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Classification of the glaucomas}

1 Primary glaucoma:
- Chronic open angle.
- Acute and chronic closed angle.

2 Congenital glaucoma:
- Primary.
- Secondary to maternal rubella infection.
- Secondary to inherited ocular disorders (e.g. aniridia - absence of the iris).

3 Secondary glaucoma (causes):
- Trauma.
- Ocular surgery.
- Associated with other ocular disease (e.g. uveitis).
- Raised episcleral venous pressure.
- Steroid induced.

\section*{Pathogenesis}

\section*{Primary open angle glaucoma}

A special contact lens applied to the cornea (a gonioscopy lens) provides a view of the iridocorneal angle with the slit lamp. In open angle glaucoma the trabecular meshwork appears normal on gonioscopy but functionally, it offers an increased resistance to the outflow of aqueous. This results in an elevated ocular pressure. The causes of outflow obstruction include:
- thickening of the trabecular lamellae, which reduces pore size;
- reduction in the number of lining trabecular cells;
- increased extracellular material in the trabecular meshwork spaces.

A form of glaucoma also exists in which glaucomatous field loss and cupping of the optic disc occurs even though the intraocular pressure is not raised (normal tension or low tension glaucoma). It is thought that the optic nerve head in these patients is unusually susceptible to the intraocular pressure and/ or has an intrinsically low blood flow (Figure 10.3).
Conversely, intraocular pressure may be raised without evidence of visual damage or pathological optic disc cupping (ocular hypertension). These subjects may represent the extreme end of the normal range of intraocular pressure; however, a small proportion (about 1\% per year) will subsequently develop glaucoma.

\section*{Closed angle glaucoma}

This condition occurs in small eyes (i.e. often hypermetropic) which therefore have shallow anterior chambers. In the normal eye the point of contact between

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-163.jpg?height=431&width=1053&top_left_y=1466&top_left_x=289}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 10.3 The distribution of intraocular pressure in a normal and glaucomatous population.}
\end{figure}
the pupil margin and the lens offers a resistance to aqueous flow from the posterior into the anterior chamber (relative pupil block); there is a pressure drop between the posterior and anterior chamber. In angle closure glaucoma, sometimes in response to pupil dilation, when the peripheral iris may be bunched up in the angle, this resistance is increased and the increased pressure gradient bows the iris forward and closes the drainage angle. Aqueous can no longer drain through the trabecular meshwork and ocular pressure rises, usually abruptly. This peripheral iris contact ultimately leads to adhesions, called peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), which consolidate the obstruction.

The severely reduced or stagnant circulation of aqueous deprives the whole cornea of nutrition and the posterior cornea of its oxygen supply. This causes a catastrophic failure of endothelial pumping function and a massive degree of corneal oedema and clouding. This is amplified by the raised intraocular pressure and results in a profound fall in vision.

However, a full-blown attack of angle closure glaucoma may be preceded by subacute episodes of angle closure, associated with transient rises of pressure, headaches and the experience of coloured haloes around bright lights. These rainbows are due to presence of mild corneal epithelial oedema which separates the regularly arranged basal epithelial cells so that they act as a diffraction grating. Any patient presenting with a history of headaches should be asked about the presence of rainbows around lights, which are a key symptom of such prodromal attacks.

\section*{Secondary glaucoma}

In secondary glaucoma, the rise of intraocular pressure is usually due to trabecular meshwork obstruction. The trabecular meshwork may be blocked by:
- blood (hyphaema), following blunt trauma;
- inflammatory cells (uveitis);
- pigment from the iris (pigment dispersion syndrome);
- deposition in the trabecular meshwork of material produced by the epithelium of the lens, iris and ciliary body (pseudoexfoliative glaucoma);
- drugs increasing the resistance of the meshwork (steroid-induced glaucoma).

Secondary glaucoma may also result from blunt trauma to the eye causing damage to the drainage angle (angle recession).

Angle closure may also account for some cases of secondary glaucoma:
- Abnormal iris blood vessels may obstruct the angle and cause the iris to adhere to the peripheral cornea, closing the angle (rubeosis iridis). This may accompany proliferative diabetic retinopathy or central retinal vein occlusion due to the forward diffusion of vasoproliferative factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), from the ischaemic retina (Figure 10.4; see Chapter 12).

\caption{Figure 10.4 The appearance of the rubeotic iris. Note the irregular pattern of the new blood vessels on the surface.}
\end{figure}
- A large choroidal melanoma may push the iris forward, approximating it to the peripheral cornea and causing an acute attack of angle closure glaucoma.
- A cataract may swell, pushing the iris forward and close the drainage angle.
- Uveitis may cause the iris to adhere to the trabecular meshwork.

Raised episcleral venous pressure is an unusual cause of glaucoma but may be seen in caroticocavernous sinus fistula, where a connection between the carotid artery or its meningeal branches and the cavernous sinus causes a marked elevation in orbital venous pressure. It is also thought to be the cause of the raised intraocular pressure in patients with the Sturge-Weber syndrome.

\section*{Congenital glaucoma}
