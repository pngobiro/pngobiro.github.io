                        <p>Cataract is the name given to any light-scattering opacity within the lens wherever it is located. When it lies on the visual axis or is extensive, it gives rise to visual loss. Cataract is the commonest cause of treatable blindness in the world. The large majority of cataracts occur in older subjects, as a result of cumulative exposure to environmental and other influences, such as smoking, UV radiation and elevated blood sugar levels. This is referred to as age-related cataract.</p>
                        <p>Age of onset is lower in countries with the highest prevalence of cataract, reflecting the influence of special cataractogenic factors. A smaller number are associated with specific ocular or systemic disease and defined physicochemical mechanisms. Some are congenital and may be inherited.</p>

                        <p>A cataract of sufficient degree causes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a painless loss of vision;</li>
                            <li>glare;</li>
                            <li>in some instances, a change in refraction.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In infants, cataract causes amblyopia (a failure of visual maturation) by depriving the retina of a formed image at a critical stage of visual development. Infants with suspected cataract or a family history of congenital cataracts should be assessed by an ophthalmologist shortly after birth, as a matter of urgency (see Congenital cataract, below).</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="signs" class="subsection-heading">Signs</h3>
                        <p>Visual acuity is reduced. In some patients the acuity, measured in a dark room, may seem satisfactory, but if the same test is carried out in bright light or sunlight, the acuity falls, as a result of glare and loss of contrast. Also, small pupils in bright light may restrict light entry.</p>
                        <p>A cataract appears black against the red reflex when the eye is examined with a direct ophthalmoscope (see Chapter 2). Slit-lamp examination allows the cataract to be examined in detail, and the exact site of the opacity in the lens can be identified. Age-related cataract is commonly nuclear, cortical or subcapsular in location (Figure 8.1). Steroid-induced cataract is commonly posterior subcapsular. Other features to suggest an ocular cause for the cataract may be found, for example pigment deposition on the lens suggesting previous inflammation, or damage to the iris suggesting previous ocular trauma (Figure 8.2).</p>

                        <p>Although much effort has been directed towards slowing the progression of, or preventing cataract, management remains surgical. There is no need to wait for the cataract to ‘ripen’ and cause major visual loss. The test is whether or not the cataract produces sufficient visual symptoms to reduce the quality of life. Patients may have difficulty in recognizing faces, reading, carrying out their occupation or achieving the driving standard. Some patients may be greatly troubled by glare. Prior to surgery patients must be informed of any coexisting eye disease which may influence the outcome of cataract surgery and the visual prognosis.</p>

                        <p>The operation (Figure 8.3) requires access to the lens substance via an opening in the anterior part of the lens capsule, removal of most of the lens fibres and epithelial cells, and insertion of a plastic lens implant of appropriate optical power. The implant is held in place within the ‘capsular bag’.</p>
                        <p>Surgery is increasingly performed under local rather than general anaesthesia. Local anaesthetic is infiltrated around the globe and lids or given topically. Usually the patient can attend as a day case, without admission to hospital, returning home shortly after surgery.</p>

                            <figcaption>Figure 8.3 Stages in the removal of a cataract and the placement of an intraocular lens. (a) An incision is made in the cornea or anterior sclera. A small, stepped self-sealing incision is made for phacoemulsification and a wider, limbal incision, for extracapsular surgery (ECCE). (b) A circular disc of the anterior capsule is removed. In ECCE a ring of small incisions is made with a needle to perforate the capsule, allowing the central portion to be removed. In phacoemulsification the capsule is torn in a circle leaving a strong smooth edge to the remaining anterior capsule. A cannula is then placed under the anterior capsule and fluid injected to separate the lens nucleus from the cortex, allowing the nucleus to be rotated within the capsular bag. (c) In ECCE the hard nucleus of the lens is removed through the incision, by expression. Pressure on the eye causes the nucleus to pass out through the incision. (d) Alternatively the nucleus can be emulsified in situ. The phacoemulsification probe, introduced through the small corneal or scleral incision, shaves away the nucleus. (e) The remaining soft lens matter is aspirated, leaving only the posterior capsule and the peripheral part of the anterior capsule. (f) An intraocular lens is implanted into the remains of the capsule. To allow implantation through the small phacoemulsification wound, the lens must be folded in half or injected through a special introducer into the eye. The incision is repaired with fine nylon sutures. If phacoemulsification has been used the incision in the eye is smaller and a suture is usually not required.</figcaption>

                        <p>The operation can be performed:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>By emulsification of the lens, using an ultrasound probe introduced through a smaller incision at the limbus (<strong>phacoemulsification</strong> or ‘phaco’). (Figure 8.3d). Usually no suture is required. This is now the preferred method in the Western world.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively, through an extended incision at the limbus, followed by <strong>extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE)</strong> (Figure 8.3c). Here, after opening the capsule, the bulk of the lens substance is expressed from the eye with gentle pressure and residual material is aspirated with a cannula. The incision must be sutured and the sutures removed postoperatively.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The optical power of the lens implant is calculated prior to surgery by measuring the length of the eye ultrasonically and the curvature of the cornea (and thus its optical power) optically (keratometry). The power of the lens is generally calculated to provide good distance acuity without glasses (i.e. emmetropia). The choice of implant power is influenced by the refraction of the fellow eye and whether it too has a cataract which will require surgery. Where surgery on the fellow eye is likely to be delayed, it is important that the patient is not left with a major difference in the refractive state of the two eyes (aniseikonia), since the difference in retinal image size may not be tolerated visually.</p>
                        <p>Postoperatively the patient is given a short course of steroid and antibiotic drops. New glasses, if required, can be prescribed after a few weeks, once the incision has healed. Visual rehabilitation and the prescription of new glasses is much quicker after phacoemulsification. Since the patient cannot accommodate, a spectacle correction will be required postoperatively for close work even if it is not needed for distance. Multifocal intraocular lenses, which provide good distance and near vision without glasses, are now in use, although there may be a reduction in contrast sensitivity with these lenses.</p>
                        <p>Surgery may sometimes induce a degree of corneal astigmatism. Where sutures were used their postoperative removal may reduce this. This is done prior to measuring the patient for new glasses but after the wound has healed and steroid drops have been stopped. Excessive corneal curvature can be induced in the line of a tight suture. Removal usually solves this problem and is easily accomplished in the clinic under local anaesthetic with the patient sitting at the slit lamp. Loose sutures must be removed to prevent infection but it may be necessary to resuture the incision if healing is imperfect. Sutureless phacoemulsification through a smaller incision avoids these complications. Furthermore, a modified entry site or relaxing incisions at the periphery of the cornea may allow correction of pre-existing astigmatism. Pre-existing corneal astigmatism can also be treated with toric intraocular lenses, which incorporate the astigmatic correction.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="complications" class="subsection-heading">Complications of cataract surgery</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Vitreous loss.</strong> If the posterior capsule is damaged during the operation the vitreous gel may come forward into the anterior chamber, where it represents a risk for glaucoma or may cause retinal traction. The gel requires careful aspiration and excision (vitrectomy) at the time of surgery and placement of the intraocular lens may need to be deferred to a secondary procedure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Iris prolapse.</strong> The iris may protrude through the surgical incision in the immediate postoperative period. It appears as a dark area at the incision site. The pupil is distorted. This requires prompt surgical repair.</li>
                            <li><strong>Endophthalmitis.</strong> A serious but rare infective complication of cataract extraction (less than 0.3%). Patients present, usually within a few days of surgery, with:
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>a painful red eye;</li>
                                    <li>reduced visual acuity;</li>
                                    <li>a collection of white cells in the anterior chamber (hypopyon).</li>
                                </ol>
                                This is an extreme ophthalmic emergency. The patient requires urgent sampling of the aqueous and vitreous for microbiological analysis and an intravitreal, broad-spectrum, antibiotic injection at the time of sampling (e.g. vancomycin and ceftazidime) to provide immediate cover. Further injections are dependent on the microbiological report and clinical response. In some instances topical and systemic antibiotics are used in addition.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Cystoid macular oedema.</strong> The macula may become oedematous following surgery, particularly if surgery was accompanied by vitreous loss or followed by inflammation. It may settle with time but can produce a severe reduction in acuity. Inflammatory prostaglandin release may play a part in this and prompt treatment with topical NSAIDs and steroid can alleviate the oedema in a proportion of patients. Sometimes it may require treatment with steroids injected into or around the eye.</li>
                            <li><strong>Retinal detachment.</strong> Modern techniques of cataract extraction are associated with a low rate of this complication. It is increased if there has been vitreous loss. The symptoms, signs and management are described in Chapter 11.</li>
                            <li><strong>Opacification of the posterior capsule</strong> (Figure 8.4). Normally, the thin capsular layer, lying behind the implant, is crystal clear. However, in approximately 20% of patients clarity of the posterior capsule decreases in the months following surgery, when residual epithelial cells migrate across its surface to form an opaque scar. Vision becomes blurred and there may be problems with glare. A small opening can be made in the capsule with a laser (neodymium yttrium garnet (ndYAG) laser) as an outpatient procedure. There is a small risk of cystoid macular oedema or retinal detachment following YAG capsulotomy. Research aimed at reducing this complication has shown that the lens implant material, the shape of the edge of the lens and overlap of the intraocular lens by a small rim of anterior capsule are important in preventing posterior capsule opacification.</li>

                        <p>The presence of congenital or infantile cataract is a threat to sight, not only because of the immediate obstruction to vision but because disturbance of the retinal image impairs visual maturation in the infant and leads to amblyopia and squint (see Chapter 15). If bilateral cataract is present and has a significant effect on retinal image formation this will cause amblyopia, squint and an oscillation of the eyes (nystagmus). Both cataractous lenses require urgent surgery and the fitting of contact lenses to correct the aphakia. The management of contact lenses requires considerable input and motivation from the parents of the child.</p>
                        <p>The treatment of uniocular congenital cataract remains controversial. Unfortunately the results of surgery are disappointing and vision may improve little because amblyopia develops despite adequate optical correction with a contact lens. To maximize the chances of success, treatment must be performed within the first few weeks of life and be accompanied by a coordinated patching routine to the fellow eye to stimulate visual maturation in the amblyopic eye and minimize the risk of squint. Increasingly, intraocular lenses are being implanted in children over 2 years old. The eye becomes increasingly myopic as the child grows, however, making the choice of lens implant power difficult. There is a significant risk of subsequent glaucoma developing in patients undergoing surgery for congenital cataract, particularly when this is performed prior to 1 year of age.</p>

                        <p>The irregular myopia can be corrected optically, although sometimes an aphakic correction may be required if the lens is substantially displaced from the visual axis. Surgical removal may be indicated, particularly if the displaced lens has caused a secondary glaucoma, but surgery may result in further complications.</p>

Worldwide there are in excess of 20 million people blind due to dense bilateral cataract (for more detail see Chapter 17). This represents a huge cause of preventable blindness. Cataract is a major focus of the Vision 2020 project, a joint initiative of the World Health Organization and the International Association for the Blind. The goal is to remove cataract as a cause of blindness by the year 2020.</p>
