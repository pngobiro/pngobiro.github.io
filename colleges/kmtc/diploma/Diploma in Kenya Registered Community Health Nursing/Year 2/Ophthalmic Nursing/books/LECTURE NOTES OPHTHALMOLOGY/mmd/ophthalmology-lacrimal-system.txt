\section*{Introduction}

Movements of the pupil are controlled by the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. The pupils constrict (miosis) when the eye is illuminated (parasympathetic activation, sympathetic relaxation) and dilate (mydriasis) in the dark (sympathetic activation, parasympathetic relaxation). When the eyes focus on a near object, they converge and the pupils constrict (the near response). The pupils are normally equal in size but some $20 \%$ of people may have noticeably unequal pupils (anisocoria) with no associated disease.

The key to diagnosis of pupillary disorders is to:
- determine which pupil is abnormal;
- search for associated signs.

\end{figure}

Disorders of the pupil may result from:
- ocular disease;
- disorders of the controlling neural pathway;
- pharmacological action.

The parasympathetic fibres reach the eye through the third cranial nerve. The sympathetic pathway is shown in Figure 13.1.

\section*{Ocular causes of pupillary abnormality}

Several diseases of the eye cause pupil irregularity and alter pupil reactions:
- anterior uveitis, when posterior synechiae give the pupil an irregular appearance (see Chapter 9);
- the sequelae of intraocular surgery;
- blunt trauma to the eye, which may rupture the sphincter muscle, causing irregularity or fixed dilation (traumatic mydriasis);
- an acute and severe rise in ocular pressure - as in acute glaucoma.

\section*{Neurological causes of an abnormal pupil}

\section*{Horner's syndrome}

Interruption of the sympathetic pathway causes:
- A small pupil on the affected side due to loss of the dilator function (Figure 13.2). This is more noticeable in the dark, because the normal pupil of the fellow eye dilates more than that of the affected pupil.
- A slight ptosis on the affected side.
- An apparent recession of the globe into the orbit (enophthalmos). The reduced palpebral aperture size gives an impression of recession.
- Lack of sweating on the affected side, if the sympathetic pathway is affected proximal to the base of the skull. This catches fibres travelling with the branches of the external carotid, which innervate the skin of the face.

Because of its extended course, the sympathetic pathway may be affected by a multitude of pathologies. Examples include:
- Syringomyelia, an expanding cavity within the spinal cord, sometimes extending into the medulla (syringobulbia), which compresses the pathway. Typically, it also causes wasting of the hand muscles and loss of sensation.
- Small-cell carcinoma at the lung apex which catches the cervical sympathetic chain. Involvement of the brachial plexus gives rise to pain and to T1 wasting of the small muscles of the hand in Pancoast's syndrome.
- Neck injury, disease or surgery.
- Cavernous sinus disease - catching the sympathetic carotid plexus in the sinus.

Horner's syndrome may also be congenital, in which case the iris colour may be altered when compared to the fellow eye (heterochromia).

\section*{Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD)}

A lesion of the optic nerve on one side blocks the afferent limb of the pupillary light reflex. The pupils are equal and of normal size, but the pupillary response to light directed to the affected side is reduced, while the near reflex is intact. Testing for an RAPD is critical in a patient suspected of having an optic nerve lesion, such as optic neuritis (see Chapter 2). An RAPD may be seen in very severe disease of the retina but not with opacities of the cornea or lens.

\section*{Light-near dissociation}

The key feature is an impaired reaction of the pupils to light, while the near response to accommodation is retained. It is seen with Adie's tonic pupil, the Argyll Robertson pupil and with peri-aqueductal brainstem lesions such as Parinaud's syndrome. Other causes include diabetes and multiple sclerosis. There is no condition in which the light reflex is intact but the near reflex is defective.

\section*{Adie's tonic pupil}

This is a not uncommon cause of unequal pupil size (anisocoria) in young adults, but has no serious consequences. Onset is subacute and affects females more commonly than males $(2: 1)$. It is due to a ciliary ganglionitis which denervates the parasympathetic supply to the iris and ciliary body. Normally, the ciliary body receives about nine times more nerve fibres than the iris sphincter. However, on recovery from the ganglionitis, while the parasympathetic innervation of the iris sphincter is greatly reduced, most of the fibres which reinnervate it are aberrant fibres which were previously directed to the ciliary body and involved in accommodation. As the sphincter is partially denervated its muscarinic receptors are supersensitive to cholinergic agonists.

The consequence is that the pupil:
- is enlarged - because the sphincter is relatively denervated;
- is poorly reactive to light - because few of the innervating fibres were originally destined for the sphincter. Also, because of the irregular fibre distribution, pupil movement in response to light consists of a slow, worm-like (vermiform) contraction, on biomicroscopy.

Due to muscarinic supersensitivity of the sphincter, the pupil also:
- shows slow, sustained miosis on accommodation;
- constricts to dilute pilocarpine ( $0.1 \%$ ), unlike the normal pupil. This is a diagnostic test.

Because the ciliary body is also partially denervated, the ability to accommodate is impaired too and the patient may complain of blurred vision when
looking from distance to near, or vice versa. Systemically the disorder is associated with loss of tendon reflexes; there are no other neurological signs.

\section*{Argyll Robertson pupil}

The pupils are bilaterally small and irregular. They do not react to light but respond to accommodation. The iris stroma has a typical feathery appearance and loses its architectural detail. Classically it is seen in neurosyphilis. It is suggested that a peri-aqueductal lesion on the dorsal aspect of the Edinger Westphäl nucleus involves fibres associated with the response to light, but spares those associated with the near response.

\section*{Midbrain pupil}

Lesions affecting the pretectal nuclear complex in the dorsal region of the midbrain can disrupt retinotectal fibres while preserving the supranuclear accommodative pathway. This produces mydriasis and a light-near dissociation. Causes include demyelination, infarction, enlargement of the third ventricle and space-occupying tumours such as pinealoma, as part of a dorsal midbrain (Parinaud's) syndrome (see Chapter 15).

\section*{Other causes of pupillary abnormality}

In coma, both pupils may become miosed with preservation of the light reflex if a pontine lesion is present, but remember that patients taking pilocarpine for glaucoma or receiving morphine also show bilateral miosis. Midbrain lesions cause loss of the light reflex with mid-point pupils. Coma associated with a unilateral expanding supratentorial mass, e.g. a haematoma, results in pressure on the third nerve and dilation of the pupil. Intrinsic third nerve lesions also cause a dilated pupil (see Chapter 15). The pupil may also be affected by drugs, both topical and systemic (Table 13.1) and in some parts of the world bilateral mydriasis may be caused by the accidental inoculation of plant material into the eye from the Jimson weed (Datura stramonium), which contains the belladonna alkaloids atropine and scopolamine ('cornpickers's pupil'). Occasionally, patients are encountered who have deliberately instilled a mydriatic drop in order to simulate eye disease.

\section*{KEY POINTS}
- Take a good history to help exclude an ocular cause for the pupillary changes and to see if a medical condition exists which may contribute to the pupillary problem.
- Determine whether it is the small or the large pupil that is abnormal.
- Search for associated signs that may help make a diagnosis.

\section*{Disorders of the visual pathway}

\section*{Learning objectives}

To understand:
$\checkmark$ The basic anatomy of the visual pathway.
$\checkmark$ The field defects produced by lesions at different points along the visual pathway.
$\checkmark$ The causes, symptoms and signs associated with a swollen optic disc.
$\checkmark$ The symptoms, signs, treatment and complications of giant cell arteritis.

\section*{Introduction}

The innermost layer of the retina consists of the nerve fibres originating from the retinal ganglion cells. These fibres collect together at the optic nerve head, and form the optic nerve (see Chapter 1). The subsequent course of the visual pathway is shown in Figure 14.1. Diagnosis and location of disease of the optic pathways is greatly aided by study of the differing field defects produced.

\section*{The optic nerve}

The normal optic nerve head has distinct margins, a pinkish rim and, usually, a central, pale, cup. The central retinal artery and vein enter the globe slightly

nasally in the optic nerve head, referred to ophthalmoscopically as the optic disc. The optic disc may be involved in many disorders but has a limited repertoire of responses. Ophthalmoscopically it may become swollen, or it may become pale.

\section*{The swollen optic disc}

The swollen disc (Figure 14.2) is an important and often worrying sign. Papilloedema is the term given to disc swelling associated with raised

(c) The appearance of optic disc drüsen; note how the solid yellow lesions cause irregularity of the disc margin. (d) Myelination of the nerve fibres around the nerve head may be mistaken for a swollen optic disc. (e) A myopic optic disc. Note the extensive peripapillary atrophy.
intracranial pressure (ICP), accelerated hypertension and optic disc ischaemia. Papillitis, a condition with a similar fundoscopic appearance, is due to optic neuritis (inflammation) affecting the nerve head. Visual loss always occurs with optic neuritis but is uncommon with the papilloedema of hypertension and/or raised intracranial pressure; it is, however, a feature of ischaemic papilloedema.

The differential diagnosis of disc swelling is shown in Table 14.1. Some normal optic nerve heads may appear to be swollen, due a crowding of nerve fibres entering the disc. This is termed pseudopapilloedema and occurs particularly in small, hypermetropic eyes where the nerve entry site is reduced in size. Note also that myelinated nerve fibres occurring on the nerve head may be mistaken for optic disc swelling. During development, myelination of the optic nerve begins proximally and spreads centrifugally to be completed at the lamina cribrosa at term. Occasionally, as a developmental variant, the process extends into the peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer as a patch of lightscattering, myelinated fibres; the normally unmyelinated retinal nerve fibre layer is partly myelinated, giving it a feathery, white appearance which reflects the organization of the nerve fibre layer. In myopia it is common to see a pale 'myopic crescent' of peripapillary atrophy, at the temporal margin of the optic disc. In high myopia the optic disc may be surrounded by such an atrophic area (peripapillary atrophy), which may be confused with disc swelling.

\section*{Papilloedema due to raised intracranial pressure}

\section*{History}

The crucial feature of disc swelling due to raised intracranial pressure is that there is rarely an associated visual loss, although some patients, with advanced papilloedema, may develop fleeting visual loss lasting seconds when they alter posture from lying to standing (obscurations of vision).

Other important clues to the presence of raised intracranial pressure include:
- headache, worse on waking and made worse by coughing;
- nausea, retching;
- diplopia (double vision), usually due to a sixth nerve palsy;
- other neurological signs, if the raised pressure is due to a cranial spaceoccupying lesion - visual field loss; cranial nerve palsy;
- a history of head trauma suggesting a subdural haemorrhage;
- a history of medications sometimes associated with raised intracranial pressure (e.g. oral contraceptives, tetracyclines).

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{Signs}
- The optic disc is swollen, its edges are blurred and the superficial capillaries are dilated and thus abnormally prominent. There is no spontaneous venous pulsation of the central retinal vein. This has a physiological basis. The central retinal vein is exposed to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as it leaves the optic nerve to join the veins of the orbit. Normally, venous pressure in the retinal veins at the nerve head is just above ocular pressure. Venous pulsation occurs because the vein collapses briefly with each rise in ocular pressure with arte-
rial inflow. When the CSF pressure is higher than the ocular pressure, as occurs in papilloedema due to raised intracranial pressure, the pressure in the veins at the disc rises above the ocular pressure and so spontaneous venous pulsation is lost. Absence of spontaneous venous pulsation is seen in 5-20\% of those with normal nerve heads, but in this case venous collapse at the nerve head can be induced by light pressure on the globe.
- A large blind spot will be found on visual field testing, corresponding to the swollen nerve head. In chronic papilloedema the field may become constricted. A field defect may, however, be caused by the space-occupying lesion causing the papilloedema.
- Abnormal neurological signs may indicate the site of a space-occupying lesion.

\section*{Investigation}

CT and MRI scanning will identify any space-occupying lesion or enlargement of the ventricles. Following neurological consultation (and normally after a scan) a lumbar puncture will enable intracranial pressure to be measured.
Treatment is dependent on findings.

\section*{Idiopathic intracranial hypertension treatment}

Intracranial pressure may be elevated and disc swelling present with no evidence of intracranial abnormality and no dilation of the ventricles on the scan. This is termed idiopathic intracranial hypertension (previously, benign intracranial hypertension) and usually presents in overweight women in the second and third decades. It may also be caused by exposure to certain drugs such as the contraceptive pill and tetracyclines. Patients complain of headache and may have obscurations of vision and sixth nerve palsies. No other neurological problems are present. Although acute permanent visual loss is not a feature of papilloedema, if the nerve remains swollen for several weeks there will be a progressive contraction of the visual field. It is thus important to reduce intracranial pressure. This may be achieved:
- with medications such as oral acetazolamide;
- through ventriculoperitoneal shunting;
- through optic nerve decompression, where a small hole is made in the sheath surrounding the optic nerve to allow the drainage of CSF and reduce the pressure of CSF around the anterior optic nerve.

Space-occupying lesions (i.e. tumours and haemorrhage) and hydrocephalus require neurosurgical management.

\section*{Optic neuritis}

Inflammation or demyelination of the optic nerve results in optic neuritis. This is termed papillitis if the optic nerve head is affected and retrobulbar neuritis if the optic nerve is affected more posteriorly with no disc swelling.

\section*{History}
