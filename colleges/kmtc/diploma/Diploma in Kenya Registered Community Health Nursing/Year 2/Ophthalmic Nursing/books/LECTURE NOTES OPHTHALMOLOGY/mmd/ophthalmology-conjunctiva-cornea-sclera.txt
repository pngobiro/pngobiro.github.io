- an acute loss of vision that may progress over a few days and then slowly improve;
- pain on eye movement in retrobulbar neuritis because rectus contraction pulls on the optic nerve sheath;
- a preceding history of viral illness in some cases. Between $40 \%$ and $70 \%$ of patients with optic neuritis will have, or develop, other neurological symptoms to suggest a diagnosis of demyelination (multiple sclerosis).

\section*{Examination}

This reveals:
- reduced visual acuity;
- reduced colour vision;
- a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) due to reduced optic nerve conduction (see Chapter 2);
- a central scotoma on field testing;
- a normal disc in retrobulbar neuritis; a swollen disc in papillitis.

\section*{Treatment}

An MRI scan will help to identify additional 'silent' plaques of demyelination, but the patient must be suitably counselled before a scan is performed. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is essentially a clinical one, and the patient may not wish to have the presence of other possible plaques confirmed with a scan. There may be a role for steroid treatment to speed up visual recovery.

\section*{Prognosis}

Vision slowly recovers over several weeks, although often it is not quite as good as before the attack. Repeated episodes may lead to optic atrophy and a decline in vision. Very occasionally, in atypical cases, vision may not recover.

\section*{Ischaemic optic neuropathy}

\section*{Pathogenesis}

The anterior optic nerve may become ischaemic if the posterior ciliary vessels are compromised as a result of degenerative vaso-occlusive or vasculitic disease of the arterioles (see Chapter 1). This results in an anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy.

\section*{Symptoms}

The patient complains of a sudden loss of vision or visual field, often on waking, since vascular perfusion of the eye is decreased during sleep. If accompanied
by pain or scalp tenderness, the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis must never be forgotten. Ischaemic optic neuropathy is the usual cause of blindness in the disease.

\section*{Giant cell arteritis}

This is an autoimmune vasculitis occurring in patients generally over the age of 60. It affects arteries with an internal elastic lamina, which therefore includes the ophthalmic artery. It may present with any combination of:
- sudden loss of vision;
- scalp tenderness (e.g. on combing);
- pain on chewing (jaw claudication);
- shoulder pain;
- malaise.

\section*{Signs}

There is usually (Figure 14.3):
- a reduction in visual acuity;
- a field defect, typically an absence of the lower or upper half of the visual field (altitudinal scotoma);
- a swollen and haemorrhagic disc with normal retina and retinal vessels (remember the blood supply to the anterior optic nerve and retina are different) - in arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy the disc may be pale;
- a small normal fellow disc with a small cup in non-arteritic disease;
- a tender temporal artery, a sign suggestive of giant cell arteritis.

\section*{Investigations}

If giant cell arteritis is present the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 14.3 (a) The clinical appearance of the optic disc and (b) one form of field defect (altitudinal) seen in ischaemic optic neuropathy.}
\end{figure}

C-reactive protein are usually grossly elevated (e.g. ESR $=100 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{h}$ ) (although 1 in 10 patients with giant cell arteritis have a normal ESR). Temporal artery biopsy is often helpful, but again may not lead to a diagnosis, particularly if only a small specimen is examined, because the disease may skip a length of the artery. Giant cell arteritis can also present as a central retinal artery occlusion when the vessel is affected secondarily to arteritis of the ophthalmic artery.

Investigation of the patient with non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy includes:
- a full blood count to exclude anaemia;
- blood pressure check;
- blood sugar check;
- ESR and C-reactive protein to check for giant cell arteritis.

Both hypertension and diabetes may be associated with the condition. It may also be seen in patients suffering acute blood loss, e.g. haematemesis, where it may occur some days after the acute bleed. Hypotensive episodes may also give rise to ischaemic optic neuropathy. Occasionally, clotting disorders or autoimmune disease may cause the condition.

\section*{Treatment}

If giant cell arteritis is suspected, treatment must not be delayed while the diagnosis is confirmed. High-dose steroids must be given, intravenously and orally, and the dose tapered over the ensuing weeks according to both symptoms and the response of the ESR or C-reactive protein. The usual precautions must be taken, as with any patient on steroids, to exclude other medical conditions that might be unmasked or made worse by the steroids (e.g. tuberculosis, diabetes, hypertension and an increased susceptibility to infection). Steroids will not reverse the visual loss but can prevent the fellow eye being affected.

There is unfortunately no treatment for non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy other than by the management of underlying conditions.

\section*{Prognosis}

The second eye may rapidly become involved in patients with untreated giant cell arteritis but this can be prevented by prompt initiation of systemic steroid therapy. Steroid therapy may have to be continued on a prolonged basis and monitored on the ESR or C-reactive protein result. There is also a significant rate of involvement of the second eye in the non-arteritic form ( $40-50 \%$ ). It is unusual for the vision to get progressively worse in non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy, and the visual outcome in terms of both visual field and acuity is very variable. In both conditions, vision does not recover once it has been lost.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 14.4 (a) A pale optic disc compared to (b) a normal optic disc.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Optic atrophy}

A pale optic disc represents a loss of nerve fibres at the optic nerve head (Figure 14.4, Table 14.2). The vision is usually reduced and colour vision affected. On examination, the usual vascularity of the disc is lost. Comparison of the two eyes is of great help in unilateral cases, as the contrast makes pallor much easier to see. A relative afferent pupillary defect will usually be present.

\section*{The chiasm}

Compressive lesions at the chiasm produce a bitemporal hemianopia as the fibres representing the nasal retina (temporal field) are compressed as they cross in the centre of the chiasm. Patients may present with rather vague visual symptoms, for example:
- Missing objects in the periphery of the visual field.
- When testing vision with a Snellen chart patients may miss the temporal letters with each eye.
- The bitemporal field loss may cause difficulty in fusing images, causing the patient to complain of diplopia although eye position and movements are normal.
- There may be difficulty with tasks requiring stereopsis such as pouring water into a cup or threading a needle.

The most common lesion is a pituitary tumour (Figure 14.5), and the patient should be asked whether they have symptoms relating to hormonal disturbance. Treatment depends on the type of tumour found; some are amenable

\caption{Table 14.2 Causes of a pale optic disc.}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Cause & Distinguishing features \\
\hline Compression of the optic nerve & History of orbital or chiasmal disease. If sectorial, field loss may give a clue to the location of a compressive lesion \\
\hline Ischaemic optic neuropathy & A history of sudden (unilateral) visual loss in the past \\
\hline Retinal artery occlusion & The retinal vessels are attenuated \\
\hline Retinal vein occlusion & Engorged retinal veins; retinal haemorrhage \\
\hline Glaucoma (see Chapter 10) & The optic disc is pathologically cupped \\
\hline Papilloedema and chronic elevation of ICP & The visual fields are contracted \\
\hline Optic neuritis & There may be a history of previous loss of vision. Symptoms and signs compatible with multiple sclerosis may be present \\
\hline Inherited optic nerve disease & Dominant and recessive optic neuropathy are associated with onset of blindness in the first few years of life. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy results from an inheritable mutation of mitochondrial DNA. It typically affects males in early adulthood. It is bilateral. There is a bilateral central scotoma. \\

to medical therapy but many require surgical excision. A meningioma and craniopharyngioma may also cause chiasmal compression.

\section*{Optic tract, radiation and visual cortex}

Lesions of the optic tract and radiation (usually vascular or neoplastic), produce a homonymous hemianopic field defect, that is, loss confined to the right- or left-hand side of the field in of both eyes (Figure 14.6). This pattern of field loss results from the crossing of the fibres representing the nasal retina in the chiasm (Figure 14.6). Information from these fibres is projected to the primary visual cortex from the lateral geniculate body (LGB) via the optic tract and radiation. If the extent of field loss is similar in both eyes a congruous defect is

said to be present. This usually means that the defect has affected the optic radiation or cerebral cortex. Neoplasia more commonly affects the radiation in the anterior temporal lobe. The commonest cause of disease in the occipital cortex is a cerebrovascular accident. The visual loss is of rapid onset; a slower onset is suggestive of a space-occupying lesion.
