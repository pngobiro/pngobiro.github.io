                        <p>Movements of the pupil are controlled by the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. The pupils constrict (miosis) when the eye is illuminated (parasympathetic activation, sympathetic relaxation) and dilate (mydriasis) in the dark (sympathetic activation, parasympathetic relaxation). When the eyes focus on a near object, they converge and the pupils constrict (the near response). The pupils are normally equal in size but some 20% of people may have noticeably unequal pupils (anisocoria) with no associated disease.</p>
                        <p>The key to diagnosis of pupillary disorders is to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>determine which pupil is abnormal;</li>

                        <p>Interruption of the sympathetic pathway causes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A small pupil on the affected side due to loss of the dilator function (Figure 13.2). This is more noticeable in the dark, because the normal pupil of the fellow eye dilates more than that of the affected pupil.</li>
                            <li>A slight ptosis on the affected side.</li>
                            <li>An apparent recession of the globe into the orbit (enophthalmos). The reduced palpebral aperture size gives an impression of recession.</li>
                            <li>Lack of sweating on the affected side, if the sympathetic pathway is affected proximal to the base of the skull. This catches fibres travelling with the branches of the external carotid, which innervate the skin of the face.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Because of its extended course, the sympathetic pathway may be affected by a multitude of pathologies. Examples include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Syringomyelia,</strong> an expanding cavity within the spinal cord, sometimes extending into the medulla (syringobulbia), which compresses the pathway. Typically, it also causes wasting of the hand muscles and loss of sensation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Small-cell carcinoma</strong> at the lung apex which catches the cervical sympathetic chain. Involvement of the brachial plexus gives rise to pain and to T1 wasting of the small muscles of the hand in <strong>Pancoast’s syndrome.</strong></li>
                            <li>Neck injury, disease or surgery.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cavernous sinus disease</strong> – catching the sympathetic carotid plexus in the sinus.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Horner’s syndrome may also be congenital, in which case the iris colour may be altered when compared to the fellow eye (heterochromia).</p>

                        <h3 id="rapd" class="subsection-heading">Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD)</h3>
                        <p>A lesion of the optic nerve on one side blocks the afferent limb of the pupillary light reflex. The pupils are equal and of normal size, but the pupillary response to light directed to the affected side is reduced, while the near reflex is intact. Testing for an RAPD is critical in a patient suspected of having an optic nerve lesion, such as optic neuritis (see Chapter 2). An RAPD may be seen in very severe disease of the retina but not with opacities of the cornea or lens.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="light-near-dissociation" class="subsection-heading">Light-near dissociation</h3>
                        <p>The key feature is an impaired reaction of the pupils to light, while the near response to accommodation is retained. It is seen with Adie’s tonic pupil, the Argyll Robertson pupil and with peri-aqueductal brainstem lesions such as Parinaud’s syndrome. Other causes include diabetes and multiple sclerosis. There is no condition in which the light reflex is intact but the near reflex is defective.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="adies-tonic-pupil" class="subsection-heading">Adie’s tonic pupil</h3>
                        <p>This is a not uncommon cause of unequal pupil size (anisocoria) in young adults, but has no serious consequences. Onset is subacute and affects females more commonly than males (2:1). It is due to a ciliary ganglionitis which denervates the parasympathetic supply to the iris and ciliary body. Normally, the ciliary body receives about nine times more nerve fibres than the iris sphincter. However, on recovery from the ganglionitis, while the parasympathetic innervation of the iris sphincter is greatly reduced, most of the fibres which reinnervate it are aberrant fibres which were previously directed to the ciliary body and involved in accommodation. As the sphincter is partially denervated its muscarinic receptors are supersensitive to cholinergic agonists.</p>
                        <p>The consequence is that the pupil:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>is enlarged – because the sphincter is relatively denervated;</li>
                            <li>is poorly reactive to light – because few of the innervating fibres were originally destined for the sphincter. Also, because of the irregular fibre distribution, pupil movement in response to light consists of a slow, worm-like (vermiform) contraction, on biomicroscopy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Due to muscarinic supersensitivity of the sphincter, the pupil also:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>shows slow, sustained miosis on accommodation;</li>
                            <li>constricts to dilute pilocarpine (0.1%), unlike the normal pupil. This is a diagnostic test.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Because the ciliary body is also partially denervated, the ability to accommodate is impaired too and the patient may complain of blurred vision when looking from distance to near, or vice versa. Systemically the disorder is associated with loss of tendon reflexes; there are no other neurological signs.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="argyll-robertson-pupil" class="subsection-heading">Argyll Robertson pupil</h3>
                        <p>The pupils are bilaterally small and irregular. They do not react to light but respond to accommodation. The iris stroma has a typical feathery appearance and loses its architectural detail. Classically it is seen in neurosyphilis. It is suggested that a peri-aqueductal lesion on the dorsal aspect of the Edinger Westphäl nucleus involves fibres associated with the response to light, but spares those associated with the near response.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="midbrain-pupil" class="subsection-heading">Midbrain pupil</h3>
                        <p>Lesions affecting the pretectal nuclear complex in the dorsal region of the midbrain can disrupt retinotectal fibres while preserving the supranuclear accommodative pathway. This produces mydriasis and a light-near dissociation. Causes include demyelination, infarction, enlargement of the third ventricle and space-occupying tumours such as pinealoma, as part of a dorsal midbrain (Parinaud’s) syndrome (see Chapter 15).</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="other-causes-pupil-abnormality" class="subsection-heading">Other causes of pupillary abnormality</h3>
                        <p>In coma, both pupils may become miosed with preservation of the light reflex if a pontine lesion is present, but remember that patients taking pilocarpine for glaucoma or receiving morphine also show bilateral miosis. Midbrain lesions cause loss of the light reflex with mid-point pupils. Coma associated with a unilateral expanding supratentorial mass, e.g. a haematoma, results in pressure on the third nerve and dilation of the pupil. Intrinsic third nerve lesions also cause a dilated pupil (see Chapter 15). The pupil may also be affected by drugs, both topical and systemic (Table 13.1) and in some parts of the world bilateral mydriasis may be caused by the accidental inoculation of plant material into the eye from the Jimson weed (Datura stramonium), which contains the belladonna alkaloids atropine and scopolamine (‘cornpickers’s pupil’). Occasionally, patients are encountered who have deliberately instilled a mydriatic drop in order to simulate eye disease.</p>

                                    <li>True. The pupil is small in Horner’s syndrome; there will also be a small ptosis.</li>
                                    <li>False. The pupil is dilated in a third nerve palsy.</li>
                                    <li>True. The pupil is small and irregular in an Argyll Robertson pupil.</li>
                                    <li>True. Both pupils may be miosed but beware of any associated pharmacological causes of miosis in patients with coma.</li>
                                    <li>False. Atropine causes mydriasis.</li>
