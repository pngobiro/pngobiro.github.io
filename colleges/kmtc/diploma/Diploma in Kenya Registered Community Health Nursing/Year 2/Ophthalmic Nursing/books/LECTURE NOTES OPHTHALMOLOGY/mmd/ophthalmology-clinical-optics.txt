The cause of congenital glaucoma remains uncertain. One view is that the iridocorneal angle is developmentally abnormal and covered with a membrane which increases the outflow resistance.

\section*{Chronic open angle glaucoma}
\section*{Epidemiology}

Chronic open angle glaucoma affects 1 in 200 of the population over the age of 40, affecting males and females equally. The prevalence increases with age to nearly $10 \%$ in the over- 80 population. There may be a family history although the mode of inheritance is often unclear.

\section*{Genetics}

First-degree relatives of patients with chronic open angle glaucoma have up to a 16\% chance of developing the disease themselves. Inheritance of the condition is complex. Progress has been made with a juvenile form of open angle glaucoma (presenting at between 3 and 35 years of age) caused by mutations in the myocillin gene (GLC1A), which maps to the long arm of chromosome 1. A different set of mutations in the same gene may be associated with some cases of chronic open angle glaucoma and other genes, such as optineurin (GLC1E) and WD40 repeat36 (GLC1G), may also play a role. The optineurin gene is predominantly associated with normal tension glaucoma (see later). It is likely that an interaction between these genes and others yet to be identified is required for glaucoma to develop. Other gene candidates are being sought.

\section*{History}

The symptoms of glaucoma depend on the rate at which the intraocular pressure rises. Chronic open angle glaucoma is associated with a slow rise in pressure and is symptomless until the patient becomes aware of a visual deficit or the diagnosis is made by chance. Many patients are diagnosed when the signs of glaucoma are detected by an optometrist.

\section*{Examination}

In patients with chronic open angle glaucoma the eyes are white and the corneas are clear. Assessment of a glaucoma suspect requires a full slit-lamp examination (Figure 10.5) and involves:
- Measurement of ocular pressure with a tonometer. The mean, normal pressure is 15.5 mmHg . The limits are defined as 2 standard deviations above and below the mean ( $11-21 \mathrm{mmHg}$ ). In chronic open angle glaucoma on presentation, the pressure is typically in the $22-40 \mathrm{mmHg}$ range. In angle closure glaucoma it rises above 60 mmHg .
- Measurement of the thickness of the cornea with a pachymeter. The measured value of the intraocular pressure must be adjusted according to the corneal thickness (see Chapter 2).
- Examination of the iridocorneal angle by gonioscopy, to confirm that an open angle is present.
- Exclusion of other ocular disease that may be a cause of a secondary glaucoma.
- Examination of the optic disc and determination of whether it is pathologically cupped. Cupping is a normal feature of the optic disc (Figure 10.5a). The disc is assessed by estimating the ratio of the vertical height of the cup to that of the disc as a whole (the cup:disc ratio). In the normal eye the cup:disc ratio is usually no greater than 0.4 . There is, however, a considerable range ( $0-0.8$ ), and the size of the cup is related to the size of the disc. It is greater in bigger

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
discs and less in smaller discs. In chronic glaucoma, axons leaving the optic nerve head die. The central cup expands and the outer rim of nerve fibres (neuroretinal rim) becomes thinner. The nerve head becomes atrophic. The vertical cup:disc ratio becomes greater than 0.4 and the cup deepens. If the cup is deep but the cup:disc ratio is lower than 0.4 , then chronic glaucoma is unlikely, unless the disc is very small. Notching of the rim, implying focal axonal loss, may also be a sign of glaucomatous damage. Defects in the nerve fibre layer of the retina may also be apparent and determine the location and area of field loss.

Much research is being directed towards accurate methods for analysing and recording the appearance of the disc. One involves scanning the disc with a confocal ophthalmoscope to produce an image of the disc. The neuroretinal rim area can be calculated from the image (Figure 10.6). Other techniques record the thickness of the nerve fibre layer around the optic disc. These new

\end{figure}
technologies may help to detect changes over time, indicating whether progressive damage to the optic nerve is still occurring despite treatment.

Visual field loss in glaucoma is due to the death of optic nerve axons. Field testing (perimetry, see Chapter 2) is used to establish the presence of islands of field loss (scotomata) and monitor the progression of optic nerve damage (Figure 10.7). It is known that a significant proportion of optic nerve fibres is lost before the field loss becomes apparent. This has stimulated the search for more sensitive means of assessing visual function with different forms of perimetry (a blue target on a yellow background instead of a white target on a white background), and testing sensitivity to motion in the peripheral visual field.

\section*{Symptoms and signs of chronic open angle glaucoma}
- Symptomless in its early stages.
- A white eye and clear cornea.
- Raised intraocular pressure.

\end{figure}

\section*{Treatment}

Treatment is aimed at reducing intraocular pressure. The level to which the pressure must be lowered varies from patient to patient and is that which minimizes further glaucomatous visual loss. This requires careful monitoring in the outpatient clinic. Three modalities of treatment are available:

1 medical treatment;
2 laser treatment;
3 surgical treatment.
In the UK guidelines have been published by NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence www.nice.org.uk/CG85) on the treatment of glaucoma with suggested therapeutic regimens. Each form of treatment has its complications, and therapy must be aimed at minimizing these whilst maximizing effectiveness.

\section*{Medical treatment}

Topical drugs commonly used in the treatment of glaucoma are listed in Table 10.1. In chronic open angle glaucoma the prostaglandin analogues are becoming the first-line treatment. They act by increasing the passage of aqueous through the uveoscleral pathway. Topical adrenergic beta-blockers may further reduce the pressure by suppressing aqueous secretion. Non-selective betablockers carry the risk of precipitating asthma through their beta- 2 blocking action, following systemic absorption, or they may exacerbate an existing heart

block through their beta-1 action. Beta-1 selective beta-blockers may have fewer systemic side effects, but must still be used with caution in those with respiratory disease, particularly asthma, which may be exacerbated even by the small residual beta-2 activity. Pilocarpine may occasionally be used in the treatment of chronic open angle glaucoma. If intraocular pressure remains elevated the choice lies between:
- adding additional medical treatment;
- laser treatment;
- surgical drainage procedures.

\section*{Laser trabeculoplasty}

This involves placing a series of laser burns ( $50 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ wide) in the trabecular meshwork, to improve aqueous outflow. Whilst effective initially, the intraocular pressure may slowly increase. In the UK there is an increasing tendency to proceed to early drainage surgery.

\section*{Surgical treatment}

Drainage surgery (trabeculectomy) relies on the creation of a fistula between the anterior chamber and the subconjunctival space (Figure 10.8). Aqueous humour leaves the anterior chamber, via a bleb of conjunctiva, into the subconjunctival space. The operation usually achieves a substantial reduction in intraocular pressure. It is performed increasingly early in the treatment of glaucoma.

Complications of surgery include:
- shallowing of the anterior chamber in the immediate postoperative period risking damage to the lens and cornea;
- intraocular infection;
- possibly accelerated cataract development;
- failure to reduce intraocular pressure adequately.
- an excessively low pressure (hypotony) which may cause macular oedema.

Evidence suggests that some topical medications, particularly those containing sympathomimetic agents or preservatives, may decrease the success of surgery by causing increased postoperative subconjunctival scarring, resulting in a non-functional drainage channel. In patients particularly prone to scarring, antimetabolite drugs (5-fluorouracil and mitomycin) may be used at the time of surgery to prevent subconjunctival fibrosis.

Recent research has examined the benefit of modifying the trabeculectomy operation by removing the sclera under the scleral flap but not making a fistula into the anterior chamber (deep sclerostomy, viscocanalostomy). The long-term benefit of the procedure is being assessed.

\section*{Normal tension glaucoma}

Normal tension glaucoma, considered to lie at one end of the spectrum of chronic open angle glaucoma, can be particularly difficult to treat, although in those with progressive field loss, lowering intraocular pressure may be beneficial. Some patients appear to have non-progressive visual field defects and may require no treatment.

The conjunctiva is tightly sutured. Aqueous can now leak through the sclerostomy, around and through the scleral flap and underneath the conjunctiva, where it forms a bleb.

\section*{Primary angle closure glaucoma}

\section*{Epidemiology}

Primary angle closure glaucoma affects 1 in 1000 subjects over 40 years old, with females more commonly affected than males. Patients with angle closure glaucoma are likely to be long-sighted, because the long-sighted eye is small and the structures of the anterior chamber are more crowded.

\section*{History}

In acute angle closure glaucoma, there is an abrupt increase in pressure and the eye becomes photophobic and very painful due to ischaemic tissue damage. There is watering of the eye and loss of vision. The patient may be systemically unwell with nausea and referred abdominal pain, symptoms which may take them to a general casualty department.

Intermittent primary angle closure glaucoma occurs when an acute attack spontaneously resolves. The patient may complain of pain, blurring of vision and seeing coloured rainbows around lights.

\section*{Examination}

On examination visual acuity is reduced, the eye red, the cornea cloudy and the pupil oval, fixed and dilated (Figure 10.9).

\section*{Treatment}

The acute and dramatic rise in pressure seen in angle closure glaucoma must be urgently countered to prevent permanent damage to the vision. Acetazolamide is administered intravenously and subsequently orally, together

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-173.jpg?height=443&width=659&top_left_y=1497&top_left_x=484}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 10.9 The appearance of the eye in angle closure glaucoma. Note the cloudy cornea and dilated pupil.}
\end{figure}
with topical pilocarpine and beta-blockers. Pilocarpine constricts the pupil and draws the peripheral iris out of the angle; the acetazolamide and beta-blocker reduce aqueous secretion and the pressure gradient across the iris. These measures often break the attack and lower intraocular pressure. Subsequent management requires that a small hole (iridotomy or iridectomy) be made in the peripheral iris to prevent further attacks. This provides an alternative pathway for fluid to flow from the posterior to the anterior chamber, bypassing the pupil and thus reducing the pressure gradient across the iris. This can be done with a YAG laser or surgically.

If the pressure has been raised for some days the iris becomes adherent to the peripheral cornea (peripheral anterior synechiae or PAS). The iridocorneal angle is damaged, and additional medical or surgical measures may be required to lower the ocular pressure. In some patients with cataract, lens extraction with implantation of an intraocular lens may help open the iridocorneal angle.

\section*{Secondary glaucoma}

Secondary glaucomas are much rarer than the primary glaucomas. The symptoms and signs depend on the rate at which intraocular pressure rises; most are again symptomless. Treatment broadly follows the lines of the primary disease. In secondary glaucoma it is important to treat any underlying cause, e.g. uveitis, which may be responsible for the glaucoma.

In particularly difficult cases it may be necessary to selectively ablate the ciliary processes in order to reduce aqueous production. This is done by application of a laser or cryoprobe to the sclera overlying the processes. Endoscopic techniques are also under development.

\section*{Congenital glaucoma}

This covers a diverse range of disease. It may present at birth or within the first year. Symptoms and signs include:
- excessive tearing, photophobia and blepharospasm;
- an increased corneal diameter and enlargement of the globe (buphthalmos), resulting in progressive myopia;
- a cloudy cornea due to epithelial and stromal oedema;
- splits in Descemet's membrane.

Congenital glaucoma is usually treated surgically. An incision is made into the trabecular meshwork (goniotomy) to increase aqueous drainage, or a direct passage between Schlemm's canal and the anterior chamber is created (trabeculotomy).

\section*{Prognosis of the glaucomas}

The goal of treatment in glaucoma is to stop or reduce the rate of visual damage. It may be that control of intraocular pressure alone is not the only factor that needs to be addressed in the management of glaucoma. The possible role of optic nerve ischaemia has been discussed, and there is interest in developing neuroprotective drugs. Reducing intraocular pressure is thus currently the mainstay of treatment. Some patients will continue to develop visual loss despite a large decrease in intraocular pressure. Nonetheless vigorous lowering of intraocular pressure, even when it does not prevent continued visual loss, appears to significantly reduce the rate of progression. If the diagnosis is made late, when there is already significant visual damage, the eye is more likely to become blind despite treatment (Figure 10.10).

If intraocular pressure remains controlled following acute treatment of angle closure glaucoma, progressive visual damage is unlikely. The same applies to the secondary glaucomas, if treatment of the underlying cause results in a reduction of intraocular pressure into the normal range.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 10.10 All eyes suffer a gradual loss of neurones with aging but death normally precedes a visually significant decline. In glaucoma this loss is speeded up and visually significant loss may occur during life (red line). Early diagnosis of the condition with lowering of intraocular pressure results in future age-related neuronal loss only (green line parallel to the normal eye). Even if there is some continued glaucomatous damage the rate is slowed and the patient is unlikely to suffer visual loss during their lifetime (interrupted green line). If the diagnosis is made late (purple lines), arresting the glaucoma completely may still result in visual loss during the patient's lifetime. This emphasizes the need for early diagnosis.}

\section*{KEY POINTS}
- Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy caused by an elevation of intraocular pressure.
- Glaucomatous optic neuropathy is distinguished from that due to other causes by an enlarged optic cup.
- Primary glaucoma is classified according to whether the trabecular meshwork is obstructed by the peripheral iris (angle closure) or not (open angle glaucoma).
- Treatment of glaucoma relies on lowering ocular pressure to reduce or prevent further visual damage.
- Ocular pressure can be reduced with topical and systemic medications, laser treatment and surgery.
- Beware patients who are acutely ill, with a red eye; they may have acute angle closure glaucoma.
