                        <h3 id="proptosis" class="subsection-heading">Proptosis</h3>
                        <p>Proptosis, or exophthalmos, is a protrusion of the eye caused by a spaceoccupying lesion. It can be measured with an exophthalmometer. A difference of prominence of more than 3 mm between the two eyes is significant. Various other features give a clue to the pathological process involved (Figure 4.1).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the eye is displaced directly forwards it suggests a space-occupying lesion lying within the extraocular muscle cone (an intra-conal lesion). An example would be an optic nerve sheath meningioma.</li>
                            <li>If the eye is displaced to one side, a lesion outside the muscle cone is likely (an extra-conal lesion). For example, a tumour of the lacrimal gland displaces the globe to the nasal side.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-081-1.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 Diagram illustrating the potential sites of orbital disease. It shows a cross-section of the orbit with labels for intra-conal and extra-conal lesions, lacrimal gland tumors, optic nerve lesions, and sinus involvement, all of which can cause displacement of the eyeball." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A transient proptosis induced by increasing the cephalic venous pressure (by a Valsalva manoeuvre) is a sign of orbital varices.</li>
                            <li>The speed of onset of proptosis may also give clues to the aetiology. A slow onset suggests a benign tumour whereas rapid onset is seen in inflammatory disorders, malignant tumours and caroticocavernous fistula.</li>
                            <li>The presence of pain may suggest infection (e.g. orbital cellulitis).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 id="enophthalmos" class="subsection-heading">Enophthalmos</h3>
                        <p>Enophthalmos is a backward displacement of the globe. It is a feature of an orbital ‘blowout fracture’, when blunt injury to the globe and orbit fractures a thin orbital wall and displaces orbital contents into an adjacent sinus. It was also said to occur in Horner’s syndrome, but this is really a pseudo-enophthalmos due to narrowing of the palpebral fissure (see Chapter 13).</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="pain" class="subsection-heading">Pain</h3>
                        <p>Inflammatory conditions, infective disorders and rapidly progressing tumours cause pain. This is not usually present with benign tumours.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="eyelid-conjunctival-changes" class="subsection-heading">Eyelid and conjunctival changes</h3>
                        <p>Conjunctival injection and swelling suggest an inflammatory or infective process. Infection is associated with reduced eye movements, erythema and swelling of the lids (orbital cellulitis). With more anterior lid inflammation (preseptal cellulitis), eye movements are full and the globe is not inflamed, thus excluding the more serious, orbital cellulitis.</p>
                        <p>Florid engorgement of the conjunctival vessels suggests a caroticocavernous fistula (see below).</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="binocular-diplopia" class="subsection-heading">Binocular diplopia</h3>
                        <p>Binocular diplopia occurs when only one of the two eyes is fixated on a target. Thus the image in the second eye does not fall upon the fovea. This can be due to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Direct involvement of the muscles in myositis and dysthyroid eye disease (Graves’ disease). The eye appears to be tethered, so that eye movement is restricted in a direction away from the field of action of the affected muscle (e.g. if the inferior rectus is thickened in thyroid eye disease there will be restriction of upgaze).</li>
                            <li>Involvement of the nerve supply to the extraocular muscles (paralytic squint). Here, diplopia occurs during gaze into the field of action of the muscle (e.g. palsy of the right lateral rectus produces diplopia in right horizontal gaze).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 id="visual-acuity" class="subsection-heading">Visual acuity</h3>
                        <p>This may be reduced by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>exposure keratopathy from severe proptosis, when the cornea is no longer protected by the lids and tear film;</li>
                            <li>optic nerve involvement by compression or inflammation;</li>
                            <li>distortion of the macula due to compression of the globe by a posterior, space-occupying lesion.</li>

                        <p>Dysthyroid eye disease and ocular myositis present with symptoms and signs of orbital disease. They are described in Chapter 15.</p>
                        <p>In children a rapidly developing proptosis may be caused by a rare rhabdomyosarcoma of the extraocular muscles (see Orbital tumours, below).</p>

                        <p><strong>Orbital cellulitis</strong> is a serious condition which can cause blindness and may spread to cause a brain abscess (Figure 4.2). The infection often arises from an adjacent ethmoid sinus, reflecting that the medial wall of the orbit is extremely thin. The commonest causative organisms are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. The patient presents with:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a painful, proptosed eye;</li>
                            <li>conjunctival injection;</li>
                            <li>periorbital inflammation and swelling;</li>
                            <li>reduced eye movements;</li>
                            <li>possible visual loss;</li>
                            <li>systemic illness and pyrexia.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>An MRI or CT scan is helpful in diagnosis and in planning treatment. The condition usually responds to intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, but it may be necessary to drain an abscess or decompress the orbit, particularly if the optic nerve is compromised. Optic nerve function must be watched closely,</p>

                        <p>A <strong>preseptal cellulitis</strong> involves lid structures alone (Figure 4.3). It presents with periorbital inflammation and swelling but not the other ocular features of orbital cellulitis. Eye movement is not impaired.</p>
                        <p>An <strong>orbital mucocoele</strong> arises from accumulated secretions within any of the paranasal sinuses when natural drainage of the sinus is blocked. Surgical excision may be required.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="inflammatory-disease" class="subsection-heading">Inflammatory disease</h3>
                        <p>The orbit may be involved in various inflammatory disorders, including sarcoidosis and orbital pseudotumour, a non-specific lymphofibroblastic disorder. Diagnosis of such conditions is difficult. The presence of other systemic signs of sarcoidosis may be helpful. If an orbital pseudotumour is suspected it may be necessary to biopsy the tissue to differentiate the lesion from a lymphoma.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="vascular-abnormalities" class="subsection-heading">Vascular abnormalities</h3>
                        <p>A fistula may develop between the internal carotid artery or a dural artery, in the cavernous sinus, and the cavernous sinus itself (<strong>caroticocavernous sinus fistula</strong>). As a result, the orbital veins are exposed to a high intravascular pressure, the eye is proptosed and the conjunctival veins are dilated and engorged. The patient may complain of a pulsatile tinnitus and a bruit may be heard with a stethoscope over the eye, in time with the radial pulse. Extraocular muscle engorgement reduces eye movements, and increased pressure in the veins draining the eye causes an increased intraocular pressure. Interventional radiological techniques can be used to close the fistula by embolizing and thrombosing the affected vascular segment.</p>
                        <p>The orbital veins may become dilated (<strong>orbital varix</strong>), causing intermittent proptosis when venous pressure is raised.</p>
                        <p>In infants, a <strong>capillary haemangioma</strong> may present as an extensive lesion of the orbit, affecting the skin of the lid (Figure 4.4). Swelling of the upper lid may cause sufficient ptosis to cause amblyopia. Fortunately most undergo spontaneous resolution in the first 5 years of life. Treatment is indicated if size or position obstructs the visual axis and risks the development of amblyopia (see Chapter 15). Local injections of steroid are usually successful in reducing size and recently it has been shown that intralesional or systemic propranolol may cause rapid regression of the lesion (Figure 4.5).</p>

                        <h3 id="orbital-tumours" class="subsection-heading">Orbital tumours</h3>
                        <p>The following tumours may produce signs of orbital disease:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>lacrimal gland tumours;</li>
                            <li>optic nerve gliomas;</li>
                            <li>meningiomas;</li>
                            <li>lymphomas;</li>
                            <li>rhabdomyosarcomas;</li>
                            <li>metastasis from other systemic cancers (neuroblastomas in children, the breast, lung, prostate or gastrointestinal tract in adults).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A CT or MRI scan will help with the diagnosis (Figure 4.6). Again systemic investigation, for example to determine the site of a primary tumour, may be required.</p>
                        <p>Malignant lacrimal gland tumours carry a poor prognosis. Benign tumours still require complete excision to prevent malignant transformation. Optic nerve gliomas may be associated with neurofibromatosis. They are difficult to treat but are often slow-growing and thus may require no intervention. Meningiomas of the optic nerve are rare, and may also be difficult to excise.</p>

                        <p>Again, they can be monitored over time and some may benefit from treatment with radiotherapy. Meningiomas arising from the middle cranial fossa may spread through the optic canal into the orbit. The treatment of lymphoma requires a full systemic investigation to determine whether the lesion is indicative of widespread disease or whether it is localized to the orbit. In the former case the patient is treated with chemotherapy, in the latter with localized radiotherapy.</p>
                        <p>In children the commonest orbital tumour is a rhabdomyosarcoma, a rapidly growing, malignant tumour of striated muscle. Chemotherapy is effective if the disease is localized to the orbit.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="dermoid-cysts" class="subsection-heading">Dermoid cysts</h3>
                        <p>These congenital lesions are caused by the continued growth of ectodermal tissue beneath the surface, which may present in the medial or lateral aspect of the superior orbit (Figure 4.7). Excision is usually performed for cosmetic reasons and to avoid traumatic rupture, which may cause scarring. Some may be attached deeply by a stalk, and a CT scan may be necessary before surgery to identify this deeper connection. Dermoids may also occur at the limbus.</p>

                                    <li>True. See Chapter 15, page 245.</li>
                                    <li>False. This is seen in much younger patients.</li>
