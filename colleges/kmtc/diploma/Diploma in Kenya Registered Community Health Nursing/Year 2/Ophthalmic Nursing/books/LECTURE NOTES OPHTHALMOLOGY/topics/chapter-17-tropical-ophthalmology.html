                        <p>In the year 2000, 45 million of the world population were estimated to be blind, with a visual acuity of less than 3/60 or a visual field less than 10 degrees around fixation. Sixty per cent had treatable cataract or refractive error and 15% had preventable diseases such as trachoma, onchocerciasis and vitamin A deficiency. A further 25% had diabetic eye disease, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. Thus, while this figure grows by some 1 to 2 million each year, 75% of world blindness is treatable or preventable. Ninety per cent of the blind live in the poorest parts of the developing world.</p>

                        <p>In 1999, to combat worldwide blindness, the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness and the World Health Organization launched Vision 2020 – the Right to Sight. The aim of the programme is to eliminate world blindness by 2020. Many of the diseases responsible for world blindness have been discussed earlier in this book. This chapter focuses on those diseases that are the major causes of preventable blindness, and on some of the methods for delivering care in the developing world.</p>

                        <h3 id="cataract-care" class="subsection-heading">Cataract</h3>
                        <p>Cataract is the commonest cause of treatable blindness, responsible for 17 million blind people worldwide (Figure 17.1). The surgical methods available for treatment have been described in Chapter 8. In the developing world extracapsular cataract extraction remains the surgery of choice, as it is cheaper than phacoemulsification and less dependent on high-tech equipment. The results of surgery are excellent, and the challenge is to make it available. The cost of the operation, and availability of trained staff, particularly in rural communities, are major problems that have to be overcome. Various models have been developed.</p>
                        <p>In India, where cataract blindness remains a significant problem, the Aravind Eye Care system has created a highly efficient, high-volume, low-cost, selffinancing system for performing cataract surgery. The system uses income from relatively rich patients, receiving private surgery, to pay for the poor, who receive free surgery. Patients are screened in eye camps, and those in need of surgery or other treatment are referred to hospital.</p>
                        <p>At the Kikuyu Hospital in Kenya cataract operations are performed both by ophthalmologists and by technicians trained in surgery. The hospital also has a training programme, which is vital if the service is to be sustainable. Again, outreach clinics are used to screen patients, and those requiring surgery are transported to hospital. Seventy-five per cent of the cost of this service comes from fees; donations have helped develop the service.</p>

                        <p>As with all health programmes, it is important first to understand the epidemiology of the problem so that appropriate resources can be determined. There has been increasing emphasis on training local healthcare workers to run programmes, with outside aid providing equipment, consumables and training rather than direct surgical input. Additionally, assessment of the outcome of surgery is emphasized, to maximize the quality of care provided and match that in the developed world.</p>

                        <p>Trachoma causes blindness by corneal scarring and is due to infection by Chlamydia trachomatis. It was first described in Egypt in the sixteenth century. Active trachoma has not been seen in Europe since the early twentieth century but was present in America until the 1960s. Trachoma is endemic in 48 countries in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australasia. It affects more than 84 million people worldwide and 8 million are irreversibly visually impaired. Ten per cent of the world population are at risk, mostly in dry, hot parts of the developing world (Figure 17.2). It is responsible for 3% of world blindness. Some 6 million were blind from trachoma in 1990, falling to 2 million in 2003. In some developing communities some 60% of children are affected by active disease. It is endemic in rural communities, in areas of water shortage, where living conditions are crowded and sanitation and hygiene are poor.</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-285-1.jpg" alt="Figure 17.2 A world map highlighting the regions where trachoma is endemic, primarily in parts of Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, and Australasia." class="content-image">

                        <p>Transmission is by the transfer of the elementary bodies of the bacteria, from one person to another, usually from the nasal and ocular secretions of an infected child. This may involve eye to eye transmission with the fingers, the sharing of towels, handkerchiefs and bedclothes, coughing and sneezing. In addition, eye-seeking flies (e.g. Musca sorbens) act as important vectors, carrying the infective particles from eye or nose, to other individuals. The first infection does not cause serious disease.</p>
                        <p>Initially, follicles (collections of lymphocytes) appear in the superior tarsal conjunctiva (Figure 17.3), followed by papillae. Then the limbal cornea is invaded by superficial vessels (pannus) with the development of peripheral scarring (Figure 17.4). Repeated episodes of infection with C. trachomatis lead to extensive upper tarsal conjunctival scarring, lid deformity and trichiasis, which together exacerbate the corneal changes. Continued re-infection leads to chronic corneal scarring and blindness. This results from:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dry eye.</strong> Conjunctival scarring blocks lacrimal and meibomian gland duct orifices, leading to reduced tear production and excessive evaporative water loss (Figure 17.5).</li>
                            <li>Reduced lubrication through tear deficiency and loss of goblet cell mucin.</li>
                            <li><strong>Corneal trauma,</strong> due to cicatricial entropion (in-turning of the lid margins by tarsal scarring; Figure 17.6) and trichiasis, where aberrant lashes abrade the cornea. This also predisposes to secondary bacterial and fungal corneal infection and scarring.</li>

                        <p>Public-health intervention has led to the development of the SAFE strategy, which involves:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Surgery,</strong> for those with entropion, everting the lid to move the lashes away from the globe.</li>
                            <li><strong>Antibiotic therapy.</strong> A single dose of oral azithromycin is effective in treating infected individuals, but the disease must be eradicated from all individuals in a community to prevent re-infection, and treatment must be repeated yearly. This is expensive, and the disease will recur unless changes are made to the environment in which the organism prospers. This is much harder to achieve.</li>
                            <li><strong>Face washing,</strong> which reduces transmission of the disease. The flies are less likely to be attracted to the child and the child is less likely to spread Chlamydia by direct contact.</li>
                            <li><strong>Environmental change.</strong> A clean environment reduces the fly population. Improving the water supply and sanitation, with bore holes and pit latrines, is important in this respect.</li>

                        <h3 id="onchocerciasis" class="subsection-heading">Onchocerciasis (river blindness)</h3>
                        <p>Onchocerca volvulus, a filarial nematode, is responsible for this disease, which is found principally in Africa and South America (Figure 17.7). One hundred million people are at risk from the disease, some two million visually impaired and 900,000 blind in 1995. This fell to 400,000 blind in 2002. Microfilariae in the skin are ingested when the female blackfly (e.g. Simulium damnosum) bites a human for a blood meal. The microfilariae develop into infective larvae in the fly, pass to its mouth and are then transmitted to a human with the next bite. Following moulting, the larvae develop into adult worms in the body. They are found in subcutaneous skin nodules (onchocercomata) and diagnosis may be made from skin-snip biopsies. Alternatively, antibodies may be detected in the blood and PCR techniques have also been used to detect filarial DNA in skin scrapings. The adult female worm is 30-80 cm long and the male 3-5 cm long, and in the human body they have a lifespan of 9-14 years. A female worm may produce 1600 microfilariae a day and generate a body load of 150 million. These migrate in the dermis and its lymphatics and die after a couple of years if they do not pass into a blackfly.</p>

                        <p>The microfilariae, entering the eye directly from the conjunctiva or the bloodstream, are responsible for ocular disease. The living organisms inhibit the host’s protective immune response. Clinically, microfilariae are visible in the cornea, anterior chamber, vitreous and retina. Living, mobile, microfilariae may be seen in the anterior chamber on biomicroscopy. In the cornea a characteristic fluffy, punctate stromal keratitis occurs as an early sign of eye disease, each opacity representing the reaction around a dead microfilarium. With increased load this advances to cause complete opacification (sclerosing keratitis) and consequent blindness (Figure 17.8). Uveitis may be associated with anterior and posterior synechiae (Figure 17.9), cataract and secondary glaucoma. Diffuse involvement of the retina and choroid (choroidoretinitis) is a common cause of blindness (Figure 17.10), as is optic neuritis, leading to optic atrophy.</p>

                            <li>public-health intervention;</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Water courses provide the breeding grounds for the blackfly, which is why those whose work or daily life takes them to the banks of rivers are most at risk of infection. Hence the name, river blindness. Control programmes are aimed at the blackfly vector, by spraying its habitat with larvicides. The onchocerciasis control programme has been successful in the endemic West African region. A low density of human population (principally farming and fishing communities) in affected areas increases the likelihood of multiple blackfly bites. Protective clothing reduces the possibility of bites but may not always be practical. Vector control programmes are a long-term proposition because the female worm lives for 9–14 years, producing ongoing microfilarial infiltration of the skin.</p>
                        <p>Ivermectin is a filaricide which has revolutionized the treatment of onchocerciasis. It is safe and effective in killing microfilariae, and reactions, if they occur, are mild and diminish with repeated dosing. It also reduces the number of adult worms present and their reproductive capability. It is given once a year, often on a community basis. Reduction in the number of microfilariae reduces the infectious potential of the blackfly and complements vector control programmes. Over 24 million people are treated each year as a result of a donation of the drug by the manufacturer, Merck, and collaborations with national and international health organizations. The African programme for onchocerciasis control (APOC) has developed a system whereby the local community is responsible for the delivery of ivernectin treatment.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="vitamin-a-deficiency" class="subsection-heading">Vitamin A deficiency (xerophthalmia)</h3>
                        <p>Vitamin A is an essential vitamin, required for cell maturation and division and the maintenance and protection of mucosal surfaces. Dietary carotenoids from dark, leafy green vegetables, carrots, red palm oil, mangos and papayas etc. are absorbed and broken down to release vitamin A (roughly 12 molecules of carotene for every molecule of vitamin A). Pre-formed vitamin A is available in breast milk, liver, fish oils, eggs and dairy products. Vitamin A is stored chiefly in the liver. Animal sources of the vitamin are often not available in the developing world and environmental factors are crucial to a good diet. Social factors are also important, since poor water supply may lead to chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption, which exacerbates any deficiency. Lack of vitamin A increases susceptibility to these diseases. Deficiency in vitamin A, when associated with protein malnutrition and febrile illnesses such as measles, gives rise to severe disease.</p>
                        <p>Vitamin A deficiency causes blinding ocular disease (xerophthalmia) and an increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in growing, preschool children over the age of 1 year, but also in pregnant women, whose nutritional requirement is increased during gestation and breastfeeding. About 140 million children suffer from vitamin A deficiency and some 5–10 million develop xerophthalmia each year, with loss of sight in half a million. The peak incidence occurs between 3 and 5 years of age. There is a widespread distribution of clinical and subclinical disease, with much of the clinical disease seen in Africa (Figure 17.11).</p>

                        <p>The features of xerophthalmia occur in the following sequence with increasing vitamin A deficiency:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Night blindness:</strong> often the earliest symptom – due to the lack of visual pigment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Conjunctival xerosis:</strong> keratinization, thickening and non-wetting of the conjunctiva, frequently with Bitot’s spots (Figure 17.12) (foamy triangular surface plaques containing keratinized cells and saprophytic bacteria).</li>
                            <li><strong>Corneal xerosis:</strong> punctate or diffuse drying of the cornea (Figure 17.13), usually with stromal oedema. This is due to goblet cell loss and a reduced expression of mucins at the surface of the eye and also to reduced tear production. Untreated it may progress to:</li>
                            <li><strong>Corneal ulceration or focal melting (keratomalacia; Figure 17.14).</strong> This occurs more in severe disease and leads to perforation, loss of the eye and phthisis bulbi.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Night blindness, conjunctival and corneal xerosis are usually completely reversed by vitamin A therapy, and even corneal ulceration may be checked, to leave residual scarring.</p>

                        <p>Treatment with vitamin A supplementation, fortification of food or increasing the natural dietary intake is very cost-effective. A protein-rich diet is also advised, if possible. Delivery of supplements is often combined with immunization programmes. Education about breastfeeding, diet and food availability and preparation is also important. Care should be taken in women of childbearing age, as vitamin A in large doses may have teratogenic effects. For this reason, maternal supplements are recommended in the immediate postpartum period, when they may replenish maternal liver stores and ensure a supply of the vitamin in the breast milk.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="measles" class="subsection-heading">Measles</h3>
                        <p>This is an important cause of corneal scarring and childhood blindness and its severity is exacerbated by vitamin A deficiency. During infection with measles vitamin A stores are significantly depleted, which can result in severe corneal disease (Figure 17.15). Vitamin A deficiency also increases mortality from this disease. Associated exposure keratopathy, herpes simplex keratitis and other secondary infections may also cause corneal opacification, which may be compounded by treatment with local remedies which traumatize the eye, or cause infection or chemical burns. Immunization programmes help to reduce infection rates and blindness from measles.</p>

                        <h3 id="corneal-ulceration" class="subsection-heading">Corneal ulceration</h3>
                        <p>With so many involved in agricultural labour in the developing world, microbial keratitis, initiated by minor eye trauma, is not unusual. In northern climates, where agricultural injuries are less frequent, fungal infections are rare. But in tropical zones fungal keratitis may account for over 80% of infected cases. It is estimated that 1.5 million new cases of unilateral visual impairment due to corneal ulceration occur each year. Treatment can be expensive and is often delayed in the developing world. Some topical anti-fungal agents are highly toxic and may leave their own sequelae and corneal grafting for central scarring is seldom available. Antibiotic treatment of minor eye trauma has, however, an important role in preventing progression to a bacterial keratitis.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="hiv-aids" class="subsection-heading">HIV and AIDS</h3>
                        <p>Treatment available in the developed world, which has reduced the severity of ocular disease associated with opportunistic infection such as CMV (see Chapter 9), is becoming available to much of the developing world. Other systemic manifestations of the disease may however occur before the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is sufficiently low for ocular disease to become apparent. The spectrum of ocular disease is also different in developing countries. CMV retinitis is more unusual, herpes zoster more common.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="ophthalmia-neonatorum" class="subsection-heading">Ophthalmia neonatorum</h3>
                        <p>Infection of a child’s eye occurring during birth may lead to blindness within the first month of life (see Chapter 7). The infant presents with conjunctivitis and discharge. Although a number of bacteria may be responsible for infection the two most important are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Neisseria gonorrhoeae;</li>
                            <li>Chlamydia trachomatis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Gonorrhoeal keratitis may progress rapidly to corneal perforation and endophthalmitis. Chlamydial infection is the commonest cause and the associated keratitis, if untreated, may progress to corneal scarring. It can also be associated with a pneumonitis. Because of the systemic implications of these eye infections, both are treated with systemic and topical antibiotics.</p>
                        <p>Topical instillation of povidone-iodine eye drops into the eyes of neonates, at the time of delivery, is a simple and cost-effective means to prevent either disease.</p>
