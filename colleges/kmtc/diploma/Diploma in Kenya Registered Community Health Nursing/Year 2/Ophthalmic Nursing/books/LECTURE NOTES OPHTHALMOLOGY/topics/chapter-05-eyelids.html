                        <p>It may be caused by:</p>

                            <li>Mechanical factors.

                                    <li>Tethering of the lid by conjunctival scarring.</li>

                            <li>Neurological factors.
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Third nerve palsy (see Chapter 15).</li>

                                    <li>Marcus-Gunn jaw-winking syndrome. In this congenital ptosis there is a congenital mis-wiring of the nerve supply to the pterygoid muscle of the jaw (cranial nerveV) and the levator of the eyelid (cranial nerve III) so that the eyelid moves in conjunction with movements of the jaw.</li>
                                </ol>

                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Symptoms</h4>
                        <p>Patients present because:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>they object to the cosmetic effect;</li>
                            <li>vision may be impaired;</li>
                            <li>there are symptoms and signs associated with the underlying cause (e.g. asymmetric pupils in Horner’s syndrome, diplopia and reduced eye movements in a third nerve palsy).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Signs</h4>
                        <p>There is a reduction in size of the palpebral aperture. The upper lid margin, which usually overlaps the upper limbus by 1–2 mm, may partially cover the pupil or the eye may be completely closed. The function of the levator muscle can be tested by measuring the maximum travel of the upper lid from full upgaze to full downgaze (normally 15–18 mm). It is common for the eyebrows to be elevated in the presence of ptosis, as a compensatory event which offsets the ptosis. Pressure on the brow (frontalis muscles) during the test will prevent this contribution to lid elevation. Other signs, associated with, for example, Horner’s syndrome or a third nerve palsy, may be present.</p>
                        <p>Four diagnostic tests may be performed if myasthenia is suspected.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>In myasthenia, repeated elevation and depression of the eye results in an increased ptosis.</li>
                            <li>Manual retraction of the upper lid causes a ptosis or increased ptosis in the fellow eye. It is argued that the withdrawal of the stimulus to raise the retracted lid reduces the stimulus to elevation bilaterally.</li>
                            <li>Ask the patient to look down for 15 seconds and then look up at an elevated target. The lid overshoots and then falls slightly after the period of rest (Cogan’s twitch test).</li>
                            <li>Ice (in a rubber glove), applied to the lid for 2 minutes, significantly reduces a myasthenic ptosis.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                        <p>In the absence of a medically treatable disease such as myasthenia gravis, ptosis otherwise requires surgical correction. In very young children this is usually deferred, but may be expedited if the visual axis is covered and threatens to induce amblyopia.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="entropion" class="subsection-heading">Entropion</h3>
                        <p>This is an inturning of the lid margin and lashes, usually of the lower lid, towards the globe (Figure 5.2). It may occur if the patient looks downwards or be induced by forced lid closure. It is seen most commonly in elderly patients where the orbicularis muscle is weakened. It may also be caused by conjunctival scarring, drawing the lid inwards (cicatricial entropion). The inturned lashes abrade the cornea and cause marked irritation of the eye. The eye may be red. Short-term treatment includes the application of lubricants to the eye or taping of the lid to turn the lashes away from the globe. The condition can be alleviated for a period by the injection of botulinum toxin into the palpebral part of the orbicularis muscle of the lower lid, or cured permanently by surgery.</p>

                        <h3 id="ectropion" class="subsection-heading">Ectropion</h3>
                        <p>Here there is an eversion of the lid away from the globe (Figure 5.3). Usual causes include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>age-related orbicularis muscle laxity;</li>
                            <li>scarring of the periorbital skin;</li>
                            <li>seventh nerve palsy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The malposition of the lids everts the puncta and prevents drainage of the tears, leading to epiphora. It also exposes the conjunctiva and lower globe to dehydration (see Chapter 6). Ectropion causes an irritable eye. Surgical treatment is again an effective treatment.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_614828345e21f3ddf9a2g-093-1.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3 Clinical photograph showing ectropion, where the lower eyelid is turned outward, exposing the conjunctiva." class="content-image">

                        <p>This is a very common, chronic inflammation of the lid margins (Figure 5.4). In <strong>anterior blepharitis</strong> inflammation of the lid margin is concentrated in the lash line and accompanied by squamous debris around the eyelashes. The conjunctiva becomes injected. It is sometimes associated with a chronic staphylococcal infection. In severe disease the cornea is affected (blepharokeratitis). Small infiltrates or ulcers may form in the peripheral cornea (marginal keratitis) due to an immune complex response to staphylococcal exotoxins.</p>
                        <p>In <strong>posterior blepharitis</strong> (or meibomian gland dysfunction) the meibomian glands are usually obstructed by squamous debris. The two forms may occur independently.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Symptoms</h4>
                        <p>These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>tired, itchy, sore eyes, worse in the morning;</li>
                            <li>crusting of the lid margins in anterior blepharitis and redness in both.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Signs</h4>
                        <p>In anterior blepharitis there may be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>redness and scaling of the lid margins; some lash bases may be ulcerated – a sign of staphylococcal infection;</li>
                            <li>debris in the form of a collarette around the eyelashes (cylindrical dandruff). This may indicate an infestation of the lash roots by Demodex folliculorum.</li>
                            <li>a reduction in the number of eyelashes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In posterior blepharitis there may be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>obstruction and plugging of the meibomian orifices;</li>
                            <li>thickened, cloudy, expressed meibomian secretions;</li>
                            <li>injection of the lid margin and conjunctiva;</li>
                            <li>tear film abnormalities and punctate keratitis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Both forms of blepharitis are strongly associated with seborrhoeic dermatitis, atopic eczema and acne rosacea. In rosacea there is hyperaemia and telangiectasia of the facial skin and a rhinophyma (a bulbous irregular swelling of the nose with hypertrophy of the sebaceous glands).</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                        <p>This is often difficult and must be long-term for these chronic conditions.</p>
                        <p>For anterior blepharitis, lid toilet with a cotton bud wetted with bicarbonate solution or diluted baby shampoo helps to remove squamous debris from the lash line. Topical steroids can reduce inflammation but must be used infrequently, to avoid steroid complications. Staphylococcal lid disease may also require therapy with topical antibiotics (e.g. fusidic acid gel), and occasionally with systemic antibiotics. Demodex infestation responds to the application of ‘tea tree oil’.</p>
                        <p>For meibomian gland dysfunction, abnormal secretions can be expressed by lid massage after hot bathing through the closed lids. If this treatment fails, then there may be a place for topical azithromycin drops. Alternatively, meibomian gland function can be improved by short courses of oral tetracycline. Where meibomian gland obstruction is extensive, the absence of an oily layer on the tear film can induce an evaporative dry eye, which requires treatment with artificial tears.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prognosis</h4>
                        <p>Although symptoms may be ameliorated by treatment, blepharitis may remain a chronic problem.</p>

                        <p>This is a common, painless condition in which an obstructed meibomian gland causes a granuloma within the tarsal plate (Figure 5.5). Symptoms are of an unsightly lid swelling which usually resolves within 6 months. If the lesion persists it can be incised and the gelatinous contents curetted away.</p>
                        <p>An abscess (<strong>internal hordeolum</strong>) may also form within the meibomian gland and, unlike a chalazion, this is painful. It may respond to topical antibiotics but usually incision is necessary.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>stye (external hordeolum)</strong> is an exquisitely painful abscess of an eyelash follicle. Treatment requires the removal of the associated eyelash and application of hot compresses. Most cases are self-limiting, but occasionally systemic antibiotics are required.</p>

                        <p>This umbilicated lesion found on the lid margin is caused by a pox virus (Figure 5.6). It causes irritation of the eye. The eye is red, and small elevations of lymphoid tissue are found on the tarsal conjunctiva (follicular conjunctivitis). Treatment requires excision of the lid lesion.</p>

A <strong>cyst of Moll</strong> is a small translucent cyst on the lid margin caused by obstruction of a sweat gland. A <strong>cyst of Zeis</strong> is an opaque cyst on the eyelid margin caused by blockage of an accessory sebaceous gland. These too can be excised for cosmetic reasons.</p>

                        <p>This is the most common form of malignant tumour (Figure 5.8). Ten per cent of cases occur in the eyelids and account for 90% of eyelid malignancies. The tumour is:</p>

                        <p>This is a common condition in which aberrant eyelashes are directed backwards towards the globe. It is distinct from entropion. The lashes rub against the cornea and cause irritation and abrasion. It may result from any cicatricial process. In developing countries, trachoma (see Chapter 17) is an important cause and trichiasis is an important basis for the associated blindness.</p>
                        <p>Treatment is by epilation of the offending lashes. Recurrence can be treated with cryotherapy or electrolysis. Any underlying abnormality of lid position needs surgical correction.</p>

                                    <li>False. There is no central crater filled with keratin.</li>
                                    <li>True. Slow growth is usual, the shape is typical and the pearly margin is also characteristic.</li>
                                    <li>False. The appearance differs and the condition is less common. It can however metastasize and must be considered in the differential diagnosis.</li>
                                    <li>False. These lesions are usually umbilicated and may be associated with a red eye and tarsal follicles.</li>
                                    <li>False. These lipid-laden lesions, usually bilateral, are not ulcerated.</li>
