                        <p>The eye (Figure 1.1) comprises:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A tough outer coat which is transparent anteriorly (the cornea) and opaque posteriorly (the sclera). The junction between them is called the limbus. The extraocular muscles attach to the outer sclera while the optic nerve leaves the globe posteriorly.</li>
                            <li>A rich vascular coat (the uvea) forms the choroid posteriorly and the ciliary body and iris anteriorly. The choroid lines the retina, to which it is firmly attached and nourishes its outer two-thirds.</li>
                            <li>The ciliary body contains the smooth ciliary muscle, whose contraction allows the lens to take up a more curved shape which permits focusing for near objects. The ciliary epithelium secretes aqueous humour and maintains the ocular pressure. The ciliary body provides attachment for the iris, which forms the pupillary diaphragm.</li>
                            <li>The lens lies behind the iris, supported by the zonular fibrils, which run from the lens equator to the ciliary body. When the eye is focused for distance, tension in the zonule maintains a flattened profile of the lens.</li>

                            <li>The cornea anteriorly and the iris and central lens posteriorly form the anterior chamber, whose periphery is the iridocorneal angle or drainage angle. The angle is lined by a meshwork of cells and collagen beams called the trabecular meshwork, through which aqueous drains into Schlemm's canal and thence into the venous system via the aqueous veins. This is the basis of aqueous drainage.</li>
                            <li>Between the iris, lens and ciliary body lies the posterior chamber, a narrow space distinct from the vitreous body. Both the anterior and posterior chambers are filled with aqueous humour. Between the lens and the retina lies the vitreous body, occupying most of the posterior segment of the eye.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Anteriorly, the bulbar conjunctiva of the globe is reflected from the sclera into the fornices and thence onto the posterior surface of the lids where it forms the tarsal conjunctiva. A connective tissue layer (Tenon's capsule) separates the conjunctiva from the sclera and is prolonged backwards as a sheath around the rectus muscles.</p>

                        <p>The levator muscle passes forwards to the upper lid and inserts by an aponeurosis into the tarsal plate. It is innervated by the third nerve. Damage to the nerve or weakening of the aponeurosis in old age results in drooping of the eyelid (ptosis). A flat, smooth muscle, innervated by the sympathetic nervous system, arises from the deep surface of the levator and inserts into the tarsal plate. If the sympathetic supply is damaged, a slight ptosis results (Horner's syndrome).</p>
                        <p>The meibomian oil glands deliver their oil to the skin of the lid margin, just anterior to the mucocutaneous junction. This oil spreads onto the anterior surface of the tear film with each blink, to form a lipid layer which retards evaporation. Far medially on the lid margins, two puncta form the initial part of the lacrimal drainage system.</p>

Failure of the distal part of the nasolacrimal duct to fully canalize at birth is the usual cause of a watering, sticky eye in an infant. Tear drainage is an active process. Each blink helps to pump tears through the system.</p>

                        <p>The ocular surface is bathed constantly by the tears, secreted mainly by the lacrimal gland but supplemented by conjunctival secretions. They drain away via the nasolacrimal system.</p>
                        <p>The epithelial cells of the ocular surface express a mucin glycocalyx which renders the surface wettable. When the eyes are open, the exposed ocular surface (the cornea and exposed wedges of bulbar conjunctiva) are covered by a tear film, 3 μm thick. This comprises three layers:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>a mucin gel layer produced by the conjunctival goblet cells, in contact with the ocular surface;</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The cornea (Figure 1.5) is 0.5 mm thick and comprises:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The epithelium, an anterior non-keratinized squamous layer, thickened peripherally at the limbus where it is continuous with the conjunctiva. The limbus houses the germinative stem cells of the corneal epithelium.</li>
                            <li>An underlying stroma of collagen fibrils, ground substance and fibroblasts. The regular packing, small diameter and narrow separation of the collagen fibrils account for corneal transparency. This orderly architecture is maintained by regulating stromal hydration.</li>
                            <li>The endothelium, a monolayer of non-regenerating cells which actively pump ions and water from the stroma, controlling corneal hydration and hence transparency.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The difference between the regenerative capacity of the epithelium and endothelium is important. Damage to the epithelial layer, by an abrasion for example, is rapidly repaired by cell spreading and proliferation. Endothelial damage, by disease or surgery, is repaired by cell spreading alone, with a loss of cell density. A point is reached when loss of its barrier and pumping functions leads to over-hydration (oedema), disruption of the regular packing of its stromal collagen and corneal clouding.</p>
                        <p>The nutrition of the cornea is supplied almost entirely by the aqueous humour, which circulates through the anterior chamber and bathes the posterior surface of the cornea. The aqueous also supplies oxygen to the posterior stroma, while the anterior stroma receives its oxygen from the ambient air. The oxygen supply to the anterior cornea is reduced but still sufficient during lid closure, but a too-tightly fitting contact lens may deprive the anterior cornea of oxygen and cause corneal, especially epithelial, oedema.</p>
                        <h4>Functions of the cornea</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It protects the internal ocular structures.</li>
                            <li>Together with the lens, it refracts and focuses light onto the retina. The junction between the ambient air and the curved surface of the cornea, covered by its optically smooth tear film, forms a powerful refractive interface.</li>

                        <p>The ciliary body (Figure 1.9) is subdivided into three parts:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>the ciliary muscle;</li>

                        </ol>
                        <h4>The ciliary muscle</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This comprises smooth muscle arranged in a ring overlying the ciliary processes.</li>
                            <li>It is innervated by the parasympathetic system via the third cranial nerve.</li>
                            <li>It is responsible for changes in lens thickness and curvature during accommodation. The zonular fibres supporting the lens are under tension during distant viewing, giving the lens a flattened profile. Contraction of the muscle relaxes the zonule and permits the elasticity of the lens to increase its curvature and hence its refractive power.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>The ciliary processes (pars plicata)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There are about 70 radial ciliary processes arranged in a ring around the posterior chamber. They are responsible for the secretion of aqueous humour.</li>
                            <li>Each ciliary process is formed by an epithelium two layers thick (the outer pigmented and the inner non-pigmented) with a vascular stroma.</li>
                            <li>The stromal capillaries are fenestrated, allowing plasma constituents ready access.</li>
                            <li>The tight junctions between the non-pigmented epithelial cells provide a barrier to free diffusion into the posterior chamber. They are essential for the active secretion of aqueous by the non-pigmented cells.</li>
                            <li>The epithelial cells show marked infolding, which significantly increases their surface area for fluid and solute transport.</li>

                            <li>This comprises a relatively avascular stroma covered by an epithelial layer two cells thick.</li>
                            <li>It is safe to make surgical incisions through the scleral wall here to gain access to the vitreous cavity.</li>

                        <p>The eye receives its blood supply from the ophthalmic artery (a branch of the internal carotid artery) via the retinal artery, ciliary arteries and muscular arteries (Figure 1.13). The conjunctival circulation anastomoses anteriorly with branches from the external carotid artery.</p>
                        <p>The anterior optic nerve is supplied by branches from the ciliary arteries. The inner retina is supplied by arterioles branching from the central retinal artery. These arterioles each supply an area of retina, with little overlap. Obstruction results in ischaemia of most of the area supplied by that arteriole. The fovea is so thin that it requires no supply from the retinal circulation. It is supplied indirectly, as are the outer layers of the retina, by diffusion of oxygen and metabolites across the retinal pigment epithelium from the choroid.</p>
                        <p>The endothelial cells of the retinal capillaries are joined by tight junctions so that the vessels are impermeable to proteins. This forms an 'inner blood-retinal barrier', with properties similar to that of the blood-brain barrier. The capillaries of the choroid, however, are fenestrated and leaky. The retinal pigment</p>

                        <p>epithelial cells are also joined by tight junctions and present an 'external bloodretinal barrier' between the leaky choroid and the retina.</p>
                        <p>The breakdown of these barriers causes the retinal signs seen in many vascular diseases.</p>

                        <p>The nuclei of the third (oculomotor) and fourth (trochlear) cranial nerves lie in the midbrain; the sixth nerve (abducens) nuclei lie in the pons. Figure 1.14 shows some of the important relations of these nuclei and their fascicles.</p>
                        <p>Nuclear and fascicular palsies of these nerves are unusual. If they do occur they are associated with other neurological problems. For example if the third nerve fascicles are damaged as they pass through the red nucleus the ipsilateral third nerve palsy will be accompanied by a contralateral tremor. Furthermore a nuclear third nerve lesion results in a contralateral palsy of the superior rectus as the fibres from the subnucleus supplying this muscle cross.</p>

                        <h4>Third nerve</h4>
                        <p>The third nerve leaves the midbrain ventrally between the cerebral peduncles. It then passes between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries and then lateral to the posterior communicating artery. Aneurysms of this artery may cause a third nerve palsy. The nerve enters the cavernous sinus in its lateral wall and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Fourth nerve</h4>
                        <p>The nerve decussates and leaves the dorsal aspect of the midbrain below the inferior colliculus. It first curves around the midbrain before passing like the third nerve between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries to enter the lateral aspect of the cavernous sinus inferior to the third nerve. It enters the orbit via the superior orbital fissure.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Sixth nerve</h4>
                        <p>Fibres leave from the inferior border of the pons. It has a long intracranial course passing upwards along the pons to angle anteriorly over the petrous bone and into the cavernous sinus where it lies infero-medial to the fourth nerve in proximity to the internal carotid artery. It enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. This long course is important because the nerve can be involved in numerous intracranial pathologies including base of skull fractures, invasion by nasopharyngeal tumours and raised intracranial pressure.</p>

                            <li>The cornea
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>False. The human endothelium does not regenerate; dead cells are replaced by the spreading of surviving cells.</li>
                                    <li>True. The cornea has epithelial, stromal and endothelial layers.</li>
                                    <li>True. The endothelial cells pump out ions and the water follows osmotically. Removal of water maintains corneal transparency.</li>
                                    <li>True. The cornea is a more powerful refractive element than the natural lens of the eye.</li>
                                    <li>False. The fine, equally spaced, stromal collagen fibrils are arranged in parallel and packed in an orderly manner. This is a requirement for transparency.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>The retina
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>True. See Figure 1.7.</li>
                                    <li>True. The retinal ganglion cell axons form the retinal nerve fibre layer and exit the eye at the optic nerve head.</li>
                                    <li>False. The rods are responsible for night vision and three cone types are responsible for daylight and colour vision.</li>
                                    <li>False. The attachment is loose; the neuroretina separates in retinal detachment.</li>
                                    <li>True. Vitamin A is delivered by the RPE to the photoreceptors and combined with opsin.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>The lens
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>True. It does grow throughout life.</li>
                                    <li>True. This is of great importance in cataract surgery.</li>
                                    <li>False. The older, deep cortical and nuclear fibres lose their nuclei and other organelles.</li>
                                    <li>True The high protein content accounts for its high refractive index.</li>
                                    <li>True. See page 10.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>The suspensory ligament of the lens (the zonule)
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>True. Zonular fibres extend from the pars plicata of the ciliary body to the lens equator.</li>
                                    <li>False. The zonule lies behind the iris and iridocorneal angle.</li>
                                    <li>False. The ciliary muscle contains smooth muscle, not the zonule.</li>
                                    <li>True. Contraction of the ciliary muscle relaxes the zonular fibres allowing the lens to increase its curvature and thus its refractive power (this is 'accommodation').</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>The posterior chamber
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>False. The vitreous body is quite separate.</li>
                                    <li>True. See Figure 1.1</li>
                                    <li>True. See page 2.</li>
                                    <li>True. Communication is via the pupil, in the gap between iris and lens at the pupil margin. If this gap is narrowed or closed, pressure in the posterior chamber pushes the iris forward and may close the angle (acute closed angle glaucoma).</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>The tear film
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>False. The tear film is 3 μm thick.</li>
                                    <li>False. The tear film is composed of mucin, aqueous and oil layers.</li>
                                    <li>True. The mucin layer is produced by goblet cells.</li>
                                    <li>True. It provides a smooth interface for the refraction of light.</li>
                                    <li>True. These account for the antibacterial properties of the tear film.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>The iridocorneal angle
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>False. It is the site of aqueous drainage.</li>
                                    <li>True. See Figure 1.9.</li>
                                    <li>True. This may reduce aqueous drainage.</li>
                                    <li>True. The process is active.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>The optic nerve
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>True. This sieve-like structure provides support for the optic nerve as it leaves the eye.</li>
                                    <li>False. In the orbit, within its sheaths, the optic nerve is surrounded by subarachnoid CSF in continuity with that in the intracranial cavity.</li>
                                    <li>True. This is a most important blood supply for the anterior optic nerve.</li>
                                    <li>False. They are usually not myelinated within the eye.</li>
                                    <li>True. It is made up from retinal ganglion cell axons.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>The third, fourth and sixth cranial nerves
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>False. The nucleus of the sixth nerve lies in the pons.</li>
                                    <li>True. The superior rectus is innervated by the contralateral nucleus.</li>
                                    <li>False. It supplies the superior oblique.</li>
                                    <li>True. This makes the sixth nerve susceptible to trauma, which may cause lateral rectus palsy.</li>
                                    <li>True. It passes lateral to the artery.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
