                        <p>Sight impairment has been variously defined. In the UK it is defined as a vision of less than 6/18 to 6/60 and severe sight impairment, as a vision worse than 6/60. Legally it is said to be ‘so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which sight is essential’. This definition is none too helpful and each case must be assessed on its individual merits. The effects of reduced vision are influenced by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the speed and age at which it occurred (sudden visual loss is harder to adjust to than a gradual loss, younger people may be able to adapt better to poor vision than older people);</li>
                            <li>whether central or peripheral vision is affected;</li>
                            <li>the type of field defect that is present – homonymous hemianopia presents special difficulties in reading and navigation;</li>
                            <li>the existence of other disabilities (e.g. deafness).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Help and advice are available in the UK both from local government (social services) and from voluntary organizations such as the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB). There are also numerous local groups that offer support. Help is aimed at enabling the visually impaired person to lead an independent life.</p>

                        <p>In the UK, patients with poor vision who meet certain requirements can be registered as sight impaired or severely sight impaired depending on the level of visual deficit. Registration does not necessarily mean that the person can see nothing at all but helps to coordinate the services available. Not all patients wish to be registered, however, because of an assumed stigma, and it is important to discuss the subject fully with the patient. Despite the benefits that may follow registration, some patients regard it as an end to a fight against failing sight rather than a new beginning, managing the problem with all available help. It is important not to dismiss the wishes of these patients when trying to maximize their ability to manage their reduced vision. It is worth pointing out to the patient that, aside from the benefits that may affect them personally, registration contributes to the creation of national statistics about the prevalence of sight-threatening diseases and therefore can focus the attention of research and funding bodies on the need for research in specific areas.</p>
                        <p>Registration is performed by an ophthalmologist. The benefits of registration, some only available to patients registered severely sight impaired, include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Financial help (e.g. tax allowances, a TV licence concession, additional income support, a disability living allowance, an attendance allowance).</li>
                            <li>Help from the social services (e.g. a specialist assessment leading to an adaptation of living accommodation).</li>
                            <li>Exemption from directory enquiry fees.</li>
                            <li>Public transport travel concessions, railcards, disabled parking schemes for carers.</li>
                            <li>Help with access to work.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Patients with impaired sight, whether registered or not, may also benefit from the ‘talking book and newspaper’ schemes, which provide extensive recorded material. Further information is available from the RNIB website (www.rnib.org.uk).</p>

                        <p>Children with impaired sight may require additional help with education, or may be educated in special schools for the visually handicapped. The local education authority has to make a statement of the educational needs of the child. Special visual aids, including voice-activated computers and closedcircuit television, may help.</p>
                        <p>In addition, children may be eligible for the disability living allowance, which may enable parents to claim additional benefits.</p>

                        <p>As well as low-vision aids (see Chapter 3), various devices are available, ranging from telephones with large number buttons and guides that help with placing a signature on a cheque, to devices that indicate when a cup is filled. Closed circuit television systems are also available to transfer text at high magnification to a screen. Additionally, for some patients, training in the use of a cane or provision of a guide dog may aid mobility. Some patients may also benefit from learning Braille.</p>
