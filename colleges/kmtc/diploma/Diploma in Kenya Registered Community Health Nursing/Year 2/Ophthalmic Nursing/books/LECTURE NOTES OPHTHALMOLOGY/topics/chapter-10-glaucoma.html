                        <p>The glaucomas are a group of diseases causing damage to the optic nerve (optic neuropathy) by the effects of raised ocular pressure on the optic nerve head. Independent ischaemia of the optic nerve head may also be important. Axon loss results in visual field defects and a loss of visual acuity if the central visual field is involved.</p>

                        <p>The intraocular pressure level is determined by a balance between production and removal of aqueous humour (Figure 10.1). Aqueous is actively secreted into the posterior chamber by the ciliary processes, by a combination of active transport and ultrafiltration. It then passes through the pupil into the anterior chamber and leaves the eye, predominantly, via the trabecular meshwork, Schlemm’s canal and the episcleral veins to reach the bloodstream (the conventional pathway). A small but important proportion of the aqueous (4%) drains across the ciliary body into the supra-choroidal space and is absorbed into the venous circulation (the uveoscleral pathway).</p>

                        <p>Two theories have been advanced to explain how elevated intraocular pressure, acting at the nerve head, damages the optic nerve fibres:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Raised intraocular pressure causes mechanical damage to the axons.</li>
                            <li>Raised intraocular pressure causes ischaemia of the nerve axons by reducing blood flow at the nerve head.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The pathophysiology of glaucoma is probably multifactorial and both mechanisms are important.</p>

                        <p>A special contact lens applied to the cornea (a gonioscopy lens) provides a view of the iridocorneal angle with the slit lamp. In open angle glaucoma the trabecular meshwork appears normal on gonioscopy but functionally, it offers an increased resistance to the outflow of aqueous. This results in an elevated ocular pressure. The causes of outflow obstruction include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>thickening of the trabecular lamellae, which reduces pore size;</li>
                            <li>reduction in the number of lining trabecular cells;</li>
                            <li>increased extracellular material in the trabecular meshwork spaces.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A form of glaucoma also exists in which glaucomatous field loss and cupping of the optic disc occurs even though the intraocular pressure is not raised (normal tension or low tension glaucoma). It is thought that the optic nerve head in these patients is unusually susceptible to the intraocular pressure and/ or has an intrinsically low blood flow (Figure 10.3).</p>
                        <p>Conversely, intraocular pressure may be raised without evidence of visual damage or pathological optic disc cupping (ocular hypertension). These subjects may represent the extreme end of the normal range of intraocular pressure; however, a small proportion (about 1% per year) will subsequently develop glaucoma.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="closed-angle-glaucoma" class="subsection-heading">Closed angle glaucoma</h3>
                        <p>This condition occurs in small eyes (i.e. often hypermetropic) which therefore have shallow anterior chambers. In the normal eye the point of contact between the pupil margin and the lens offers a resistance to aqueous flow from the posterior into the anterior chamber (relative pupil block); there is a pressure drop between the posterior and anterior chamber. In angle closure glaucoma, sometimes in response to pupil dilation, when the peripheral iris may be bunched up in the angle, this resistance is increased and the increased pressure gradient bows the iris forward and closes the drainage angle. Aqueous can no longer drain through the trabecular meshwork and ocular pressure rises, usually abruptly. This peripheral iris contact ultimately leads to adhesions, called peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), which consolidate the obstruction.</p>
                        <p>The severely reduced or stagnant circulation of aqueous deprives the whole cornea of nutrition and the posterior cornea of its oxygen supply. This causes a catastrophic failure of endothelial pumping function and a massive degree of corneal oedema and clouding. This is amplified by the raised intraocular pressure and results in a profound fall in vision.</p>
                        <p>However, a full-blown attack of angle closure glaucoma may be preceded by subacute episodes of angle closure, associated with transient rises of pressure, headaches and the experience of coloured haloes around bright lights. These rainbows are due to presence of mild corneal epithelial oedema which separates the regularly arranged basal epithelial cells so that they act as a diffraction grating. Any patient presenting with a history of headaches should be asked about the presence of rainbows around lights, which are a key symptom of such prodromal attacks.</p>

                        <p>In secondary glaucoma, the rise of intraocular pressure is usually due to trabecular meshwork obstruction. The trabecular meshwork may be blocked by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>blood (hyphaema), following blunt trauma;</li>
                            <li>inflammatory cells (uveitis);</li>
                            <li>pigment from the iris (pigment dispersion syndrome);</li>
                            <li>deposition in the trabecular meshwork of material produced by the epithelium of the lens, iris and ciliary body (pseudoexfoliative glaucoma);</li>
                            <li>drugs increasing the resistance of the meshwork (steroid-induced glaucoma).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Secondary glaucoma may also result from blunt trauma to the eye causing damage to the drainage angle (angle recession).</p>
                        <p>Angle closure may also account for some cases of secondary glaucoma:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Abnormal iris blood vessels may obstruct the angle and cause the iris to adhere to the peripheral cornea, closing the angle (rubeosis iridis). This may accompany proliferative diabetic retinopathy or central retinal vein occlusion due to the forward diffusion of vasoproliferative factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), from the ischaemic retina (Figure 10.4; see Chapter 12).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>A large choroidal melanoma may push the iris forward, approximating it to the peripheral cornea and causing an acute attack of angle closure glaucoma.</li>
                            <li>A cataract may swell, pushing the iris forward and close the drainage angle.</li>
                            <li>Uveitis may cause the iris to adhere to the trabecular meshwork.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Raised episcleral venous pressure is an unusual cause of glaucoma but may be seen in caroticocavernous sinus fistula, where a connection between the carotid artery or its meningeal branches and the cavernous sinus causes a marked elevation in orbital venous pressure. It is also thought to be the cause of the raised intraocular pressure in patients with the Sturge-Weber syndrome.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="congenital-glaucoma" class="subsection-heading">Congenital glaucoma</h3>
                        <p>The cause of congenital glaucoma remains uncertain. One view is that the iridocorneal angle is developmentally abnormal and covered with a membrane which increases the outflow resistance.</p>
