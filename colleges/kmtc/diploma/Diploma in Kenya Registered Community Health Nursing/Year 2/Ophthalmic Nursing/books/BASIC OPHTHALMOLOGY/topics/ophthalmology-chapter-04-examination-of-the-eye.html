                        <p><b>1. Digital Tension</b></p>
                        <p>Principle-The intraocular tension is estimated by palpation of the eyes with fingers.</p>
                        <p>Method-The patient is asked to look down. The sclera is palpated through the upper lid beyond the tarsal plate. The tension is estimated by the amount of fluctuation.</p>
                        <p><b>2. Schiotz Tonometer</b></p>
                        <p>Principle-The depth of indentation of the cornea is measured.</p>
                        <p>Method - The cornea is anaesthetized with suitable local anaesthetic, e.g., xylocaine $4\%$ eyedrops.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lids are separated and a tonometer carrying a weight of 5.5 gm is gently placed on the cornea. (There are 3 more weights available 7.5, 10 and 15 gm )</li>
                            <li>The deflection is measured and reading in millimeter of mercury can be read from a chart.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Advantages-It is cheap, easy to use, convenient to carry and does not require a slitlamp.</p>
                        <p>Disadvantage-There may be error due to ocular rigidity.</p>
                        <p><b>3. Applanation Tonometer</b></p>
                        <p>It is a more accurate method. The cornea is flattened by a plane surface. This is based on the principle of Imbert-Fick's law. It states that for an ideal, thin-walled sphere, the pressure inside the sphere (P) equals to force necessary to flatten its surface ( F ) divided by the area of flattening ( A ), i.e. $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{F} / \mathrm{A}$.</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$ \text { Pressure }=\frac{\text { Force applied }}{\text { Area of flattened cornea }} \quad \mathrm{P}=\frac{F}{A} $$
                        </div>
                        <p>An applanation tonometer measures the intraocular pressure by flattening (rather than indent) the cornea over a specific area ( 3.06 mm ). This is more accurate since the pressure values recorded are uninfluenced by scleral rigidity.</p>
                        <p>Six applanation tonometers are currently in use namely,</p>
                        <ol>

                        <p>Goldmann applanation tonometer-It is the most popular and accurate tonometer. It consists of a double prism mounted on a standard slit-lamp. The prism applanates the cornea in an area of 3.06 mm diameter. The normal IOP as measured by applanation tonometer is $15 \pm 3 \mathrm{Hg}$.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Method</h4>
                         <ol>
                            <li>Anaesthetise the cornea with a drop of $2\%$ xylocaine and stain the tear film with fluorescein.</li>
                            <li>Patient is seated in front of a slit-lamp. The cornea and biprisms are illuminated with cobalt blue light from the slit-lamp.</li>
                            <li>Biprism is then advanced until it just touches the apex of the cornea. At this point two fluorescent semicircles are viewed through the prism.</li>
                            <li>The applanation force against the cornea is adjusted until the inner edges of the two semicircles just touch. This is the end point.</li>
                            <li>The intraocular pressure is determined by multiplying the dial reading with 10.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Perkins (hand-held) applanation tonometer-It is same as above except that it does not require a slitlamp and it can be used even in supine position. It is small and easy to carry.</p>
                        <p>Pneumatic tonometer—The cornea is applanated by touching its apex by a silastic diaphragm covering the sensing nozzle which is connected to a central chamber containing pressurised air. There is a pneumatic-to-electronic transducer which converts the air pressure to a recording on a paper-strip from where IOP is read.</p>
                        <p>Air-puff tonometer-It is a non-contact tonometer based on the principle of Goldmann tonometer. The central part of cornea is flattened by a jet of air. This tonometer is very good for mass screening as there is no danger of cross-infection and local anaesthetic is not required.</p>
                        <p>MacKay-Marg Pulse air tonometer-It is a hand held, non-contact tonometer that can be used on the patients in any position.</p>
                        <p>Microelectronic Tono-pen-It is a computerised pocket tonometer. It employs a microscopic transducer which applanates the cornea and converts IOP into electrical waves.</p>

                        <p>Examination of the eye is done in focal or oblique illumination under magnification.</p>
                        <p>Binocular loupe-A stereoscopic effect is obtained and the depth of opacities can be assessed. Magnification = 3-4 times.</p>
                        <p>Slit-lamp examination-It is essential when minute examination of the eye is necessary. A brilliant light is brought to a focus as a slit or point by an optical system supported on a movable arm and observations are made by a binocular microscope.</p>
                        <p>Magnification = 16, 25 times.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">5. GONIOSCOPE EXAMINATION</h4>
                        <p>The purpose of gonioscopy is to identify abnormal angle structures, e.g. anterior synechiae, foreign body, tumour and to estimate the width of the angle of anterior chamber as in closed angle glaucoma.</p>
                        <p>Optics-Normally, the angle cannot be visualized directly through an intact cornea because light rays emitted from angle structures undergo total internal reflection. A gonioscope eliminates total internal reflection by replacing the 'cornea-air interface' by a new 'lens-air interface' that has a greater refractive index than that of the cornea and tears.</p>

                            <li>i. Direct gonioscopy with goniolenses-They provide a direct view of the angle. They are used both for diagnostic and operative purposes, e.g. Koeppe, Barkan goniolens, etc.</li>
                            <li>ii. Indirect gonioscopy with gonioprisms-The rays are reflected by the mirror and the angle of anterior chamber is seen. They provide a mirror image of the opposite angle, and can only be used at a slit-lamp, e.g. Goldmann single mirror or three mirror gonioscope, Zeiss four mirror gonioscope, etc.</li>

                            <li>Trabecular meshwork-The degree of pigmentation varies. It is a sieve-like structure with occasional visibility of the Schlemm's canal.</li>
                            <li>Scleral spur-It is a prominent white line which represents the most anterior projection of the sclera.</li>
                            <li>Ciliary band-A grey or dull brown band of ciliary body is seen at the insertion of iris root.</li>

                        <p>Each eye is tested separately. A normal person can read all the lines, i.e. up to 6 m line. Thus the normal visual acuity is $=6 / 6$.</p>
                        <p>When the patient can only read the 18 m line, his distant vision is defective $=6 / 18$.</p>
                        <p>When the patient cannot read the largest letter, he is asked to walk slowly towards the chart. If he can read the top most letter at $5,4,3$ or 2 m , his visual acuity $=5 / 60,4 / 60,3 / 60,2 / 60$ respectively.</p>
                        <p>If the patient is unable to see the top letter when close to it, he is asked to count the surgeon's fingers held at 1 m against a dark background. If he can count the fingers, the visual acuity $=1 / 60$. If he can count fingers only at 50 cm , the visual acuity = counting fingers at 50 cm .</p>
                        <p>If he cannot count fingers, the surgeon's hand is moved in front of the eyes close to face. If he can appreciate the movements, the visual acuity $=$ hand movements.</p>
                        <p>In a dark room, light is concentrated on his eyes. He is asked to say when the light is on the eye or when it is off. If he tells correctly, the visual acuity = PL (perception of light).</p>
                        <p>If he gives correct indication of the direction from where the light is coming the visual acuity = PL (perception of light) and projection of rays is good.</p>

                        <p>Boundary-The peripheral limits of the visual field, which normally measures from the fixation points are approximately $60^{\circ}$ above and inwards, $70^{\circ}$ below and more than $90^{\circ}$ temporally.</p>
                        <p>Point of fixation-It is the area of maximum visual acuity in the normal visual field. It corresponds to the foveola of the retina.</p>
                        <p>Blind spot-This is an area of absolute scotoma (non-seeing area) within the boundaries of normal visual field. It corresponds to the region of optic nerve head where there are no rods and cones. It is located approximately $15^{\circ}$ temporal to the fixation point.</p>
                        <p>Scotoma—It is an absolute or relative area of depressed visual function (non-seeing area) surrounded by normal vision. It is commonly seen in cases of glaucoma, optic neuritis, papilloedema, etc.</p>

                             <li>i. Absolute scotoma-All vision is lost, i.e. no perception of light (no PL)</li>
                             <li>ii. Relative scotoma-A variable amount of vision remains.</li>
                             <li>iii. Positive scotoma-When the patient appreciates a dark area in his field of vision.</li>

                         <p>The term 'perimetry' is used to describe various techniques employed to evaluate both central and peripheral visual fields using targets of various sizes and colours. Two techniques of testing the field of vision are commonly employed:</p>
                         <ol>
                             <li>Kinetic perimetry - A target is moved across the field to map out of the two-dimensional extent of field. It involves presentation of a moving stimulus of known luminance or intensity from periphery towards the centre till it is perceived. The point of perception is recorded along different meridians. By joining these points an isopter is plotted for that stimulus intensity. Kinetic perimetry can be performed by
                                 <ul>
                                     <li>Confrontation method</li>
                                     <li>Listers perimeter</li>
                                     <li>Goldmann perimeter</li>
                                     <li>Tangent screen or Bjerrum's screen</li>
                                 </ul>
                             </li>
                             <li>Static perimetry-It forms the basis of modern glaucoma assessment. It is a three dimensional assessment of the height of a predetermined area of the 'hill of vision.' Non-moving stimuli of varying luminance are presented in the same position to obtain a vertical boundary of the visual field. The stimuli can be presented in two different ways</li>

                        <p>a. Suprathreshold perimetry-It is used mainly for screening the patients. Visual stimuli are presented at luminance levels above the expected normal threshold values in various locations in the visual field. In cases of moderate to gross loss of sensitivity, the supranormal stimulus is not seen.</p>
                        <p>b. Threshold perimetry-It is used for detailed assessment of the 'hill of vision'. Target of different and increasing intensities are presented at designated points in the visual fields until just visible to find out the patient's threshold for that point. This is the principle used in computerized automated perimeters.</p>

                            <li>iii. Margin-The margin is sharp and clearly defined normally and in primary optic atrophy. It is blurred in cases of secondary optic atrophy, optic neuritis, papillitis and papilloedema.</li>
                            <li>iv. Colour-It is normally pink in colour. It is pale or white in cases of optic atrophy. It is waxy yellow in retinitis pigmentosa</li>
                            <li>v. Cupping-Pathological cupping is seen in glaucoma. Papilloedema is seen in cases of raised intracranial tension (brain tumour) and malignant hypertension.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Macula Lutea</h3>
                        <p>It is situated 3 mm or 2 disc diameter to the temporal side of the optic disc. It is a small circular area, deeper red than the surrounding fundus. There is a bright foveal reflex in the centre due to reflection of light from the walls of the foveal pit. Cystoid macular oedema, macular hole or macular star may be seen.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4. Retinal Vessels</h3>
                        <p>These are derived from the central retinal artery and vein, which divide into two branches at or near the surface of the disc. The arteries are brighter red and narrower than veins. The normal artery: vein ratio is $2: 3$.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5. General Fundus</h3>
                        <p>Normally the fundus has a uniform red appearance. In albino, the choroidal vessels are seen clearly against the white sclera. In high myopia, tesselated or tigroid fundus is seen due to degenerative changes in retina and choroid. Black pigments resembling bone corpuscles are typically seen in retinitis pigmentosa.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">EXAMINATION OF THE FUNDUS BY FOCAL ILLUMINATION</h3>
                        <p>The ordinary slit-lamp can only explore the eye up to the anterior parts of the vitreous. By interposing a -55 D (approximately) lens in front of the cornea, the posterior part of the vitreous and the central area of the fundus can be examined after full mydriasis.</p>
                        <p>Three types of lenses are available for biomicroscopic examination of the vitreous and fundus.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Hruby's lens-It is a plano-concave lens with a dioptric strength of -58.6 D</li>
