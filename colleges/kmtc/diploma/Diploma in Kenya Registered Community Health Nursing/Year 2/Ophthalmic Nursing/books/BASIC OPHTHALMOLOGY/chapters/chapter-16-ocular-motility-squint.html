                <h2>THE OCULAR MOTILITY</h2>
                
                <h3>EXTRAOCULAR MUSCLES</h3>
                <p>There are six extraocular muscles in each eye which control their movements.</p>

                <h4>I. The Recti Muscles</h4>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-385.jpg" alt="Extraocular muscles showing the recti and oblique muscles arrangement">
                    <figcaption>Extraocular muscles</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The four recti muscles originate from the common annular tendon of Zinn situated around the optic foramen at the apex of the orbit.</p>

                <p>The recti muscles are inserted into the sclera by flat tendons at various distances from the limbus:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Superior rectus - 7.7 mm</li>
                    <li>Lateral rectus - 7 mm</li>
                    <li>Inferior rectus - 6.6 mm</li>
                    <li>Medial rectus - 5.5 mm</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>II. The Oblique Muscles</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Superior oblique</li>
                    <li>Inferior oblique</li>
                </ol>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-386.jpg" alt="Insertion of recti muscle tendons in sclera showing their distances from the limbus">
                    <figcaption>Insertion of recti muscle tendons in sclera</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h4>Superior oblique</h4>
                <p>It arises from the upper and inner margin of the optic foramen. It runs forwards to the upper and inner angle of the orbit. It passes through the trochlea (a fibrous pulley). It gets inserted into the upper and outer part of the sclera behind the equator.</p>

                <h4>Inferior oblique</h4>
                <p>It originates from the floor of the orbit near the inferior orbital margin. It passes outwards below the inferior rectus muscle. It is inserted into the outer part of the sclera behind the equator.</p>

                <h3>Nerve supply of the extraocular muscles</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The third cranial nerve (oculomotor)</strong> - It supplies the:
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Superior rectus muscle</li>
                            <li>Inferior rectus muscle</li>
                            <li>Medial rectus muscle</li>
                            <li>Inferior oblique muscle</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The 4th cranial nerve (trochlear)</strong> - It supplies the superior oblique muscle.</li>
                    <li><strong>The 6th cranial nerve (abducens)</strong> - It supplies the lateral rectus muscle.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Blood Supply</h3>
                <p>The blood supply is by the muscular branches of the ophthalmic artery.</p>

            <section id="muscle-action" class="content-card">
                <h2>Action of the Extraocular Muscles</h2>
                
                <p>These muscles rotate the eye around a 'centre of rotation'. This centre is situated 12-13 mm behind the cornea in a horizontal plane.</p>

                <p>Three types of movements are possible around the centre of rotation:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Movements around the vertical axis whereby eye is turned from side to side.</li>
                    <li>Movements around the horizontal axis whereby eye is turned upwards or downwards.</li>
                    <li>Movements around the anteroposterior axis whereby an involuntary movement of 'torsion' occurs.
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Intorsion - When the upper pole of the cornea rotates nasally.</li>
                            <li>Extorsion - When the upper pole of the cornea rotates temporally.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-387.jpg" alt="Action of the extraocular muscles showing directional movements">
                    <figcaption>Action of the extraocular muscles</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The lateral and medial walls of the orbit make an angle of 45° with each other. The orbital axis therefore forms an angle of 22.5° with both the lateral and medial walls. For the sake of simplicity this angle is usually regarded as being 23°. When the eye is looking straight ahead at a fixed point on the horizon with the head erect (primary position of gaze), its optical axis forms an angle of 23° with the orbital axis. The actions of the extraocular muscles depend on the position of the globe at the time of muscle contraction. The primary action of a muscle is its major effect when the eye is in the primary position and its subsidiary actions are the additional effects on the position of the eye.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-387.jpg" alt="Right eyes viewed from above showing orbital axis relationship">
                    <figcaption>Right eyes viewed from above</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Horizontal Recti (Medial and Lateral Rectus)</h3>
                <p>When the eye is in the primary position, the horizontal recti are purely horizontal movers around the vertical axis and have only a primary action.</p>

                <h3>Vertical Recti (Superior and Inferior Rectus)</h3>
                <p>The vertical recti run in the same line as the orbital axis and are inserted in front of the equator. For this reason they form an angle of 23° with the optical axis.</p>

                <h3>Superior Rectus</h3>
                <p>In the primary position, the primary action of the superior rectus is elevation. This movement occurs about the horizontal axis. The subsidiary actions of the superior rectus are adduction and intorsion.</p>

                <p>When the globe is in a position of 23° of abduction, the optical and orbital axis coincide. In this position it has no subsidiary actions and can only act as an elevator. This is therefore the best position of the globe for testing the function of the superior rectus muscle.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-388.jpg" alt="Applied anatomy of extraocular muscles">
                    <figcaption>Applied anatomy of extraocular muscles</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Superior oblique</h3>
                <p>The superior oblique is inserted behind the equator and it forms an angle of 51° with the optical axis. In the primary position, the primary action of the superior oblique is intorsion. This movement occurs about the vertical axis passing through the centre of pupil. In this position, subsidiary actions are depression and abduction.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-388.jpg" alt="Actions of the superior rectus muscle">
                    <figcaption>Actions of the superior rectus muscle</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>When the globe is in a position of 51° of adduction, the optical axis of the globe coincides with the line of pull of the muscle. In this position it can only act as a depressor. This is therefore, the best position of globe for clinically testing the action of the superior oblique muscle.</p>

                <p>The action of the extraocular muscles can be thus summarized as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>All the recti muscles are Adductors except lateral rectus.</li>
                    <li>Both the oblique muscle are Abductors.</li>
                    <li>Both the superior muscles are intortors.</li>
                    <li>Both the inferior muscles are extortors.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>With this basic knowledge it is easy to work out the respective actions of the inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles.</p>

                <h2>CONJUGATE MOVEMENTS OF THE EYEBALL</h2>
                
                <p>When both the eyes move together keeping their visual axis parallel, the movements are known as conjugate movements.</p>

                <figure>

                <h3>The Action of Extraocular Muscles in Binocular Movements</h3>
                <p>Every movement of the eyeball is a 'synkinesis' therefore:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Abduction of one eye is always accompanied by adduction of the other.</li>
                    <li>Elevation or depression of one eye is always accompanied by elevation or depression of the other.</li>
                    <li>The only exception to this rule is bilateral abduction of the eye in convergence where both medial rectus contract together.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Synergist Muscles</h3>
                <p>The muscles which contract together or 'in pair' are called synergist muscles or 'yoke' muscles.</p>

                <h3>Antagonist Muscles</h3>

                <p>When the eyes are moving into each of the six cardinal positions of gaze, a muscle of one eye is paired with a muscle of the opposite eye.

                <h2>BINOCULAR SINGLE VISION</h2>
                
                <p>It is achieved by the use of the two eyes together, so that separate and slightly dissimilar images arising in each eye are appreciated as a single image by the process of fusion. In addition to achieving single vision, this fusion results in stereopsis or three-dimensional vision. Binocular single vision is acquired and reinforced during the first few years of life.</p>

                <p>It requires three factors for its development:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Reasonably clear vision in both eyes.</li>
                    <li>The ability of the visual areas in the brain to cause fusion of two slightly dissimilar images.</li>
                    <li>The accurate coordination of the two eyes for all directions of gaze. There must exist a precise physiological relationship between the two retinae (retinal correspondence) for achieving fusion.</li>

                <h2>SQUINT (STRABISMUS)</h2>
                
                <p>It is a condition when one eye deviates away from the fixation point (Duke-Elder). Under normal conditions both the eyes are in proper alignment.</p>

                <h3>I. APPARENT SQUINT</h3>
                <p>The presence of epicanthus and high errors of refraction simulate squint but in fact there is no squint.</p>

                <h3>II. LATENT SQUINT (HETEROPHORIA)</h3>
                <p>In latent squint, a tendency for deviation of the eyes is present when the fusion is broken. However, the eyes regain their normal alignment or position with fusion.</p>

                <h4>Types</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Esophoria</strong> - There is a tendency for deviation of the eyeball inwards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exophoria</strong> - There is a tendency for deviation of the eyeball outwards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hyperphoria</strong> - There is a tendency for deviation of the eyeball upwards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cyclophoria</strong> - There is a torsional deviation of the eye.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anisophoria</strong> - The deviation of the eyeball varies with the direction of gaze.</li>
                    <li><strong>Orthophoria</strong> - There is no deviation of the eyes even when the fusion is broken.</li>

                <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
                
                <p>It depends on abolishing fusion so that the eyes assume their position of rest by:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cover test</li>

                </ol>

                <h3>1. Cover Test</h3>
                <h4>Principle</h4>
                <p>Fusion of the two eyes is abolished by covering one eye.</p>

                <h4>Method</h4>
                <p>The patient looks at a distant object.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While observing one eye, cover and uncover the other eye. The movements of the observed eye and the eye under cover are noted.</li>
                    <li>Repeat this process with the other eye and then alternately.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>If there is no movement, patient has orthophoria.</li>
                    <li>If there is inwards movement on removing the cover the patient has exophoria.</li>
                    <li>If there is outwards movement on removing the cover the patient has esophoria.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>2. Maddox Rod Test</h3>
                <h4>Principle</h4>
                <p>This test is done to find out heterophoria for distance. It alters the appearance of the retinal image in one eye. There is no stimulation given to fusion.</p>

                <h4>Method</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The patient is seated 6 m from a spot of bright light in a dark room.</li>
                    <li>A Maddox rod consisting of 4-5 cylinders of red glass fused side by side in a supporting disc is placed in front of one eye. The same effect is given by a disc of deeply grooved red glass (Maddox groove).</li>
                    <li>The spot of light appears as a red line. If the cylinders are placed with their axis horizontal, the red line will appear vertical and vice versa.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                <p>If there is orthophoria, the bright spot will appear in the centre of the vertical red line.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Type of heterophoria:</strong> By the position of the vertical or horizontal line in relation to the spot of light, exact type of heterophoria is detected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Angle of deviation:</strong> The strength of prism which is necessary to be placed in front of the Maddox rod or the other eye so that the red line and spot appear together; indicates the angle of deviation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nature of deviation:</strong> It is indicated by the position of the prism whether base in or base out.</li>
                    <li><strong>Amount of deviation</strong> can be measured on a graduated tangent scale set on a wall.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>3. Maddox Wing Test</h3>
                <h4>Principle</h4>
                <p>The Maddox wing is an instrument that dissociates the two eyes for near fixation (one-third of a meter) and measures the amount of heterophoria.</p>

                    <figcaption>Maddox wing test</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h4>Method</h4>
                <p>The patient is asked to hold the Maddox wing and look through the two observation slits with both eyes open.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The right eye sees a white arrow pointing vertically and a red arrow pointing horizontally to the left.</li>
                    <li>The left eye sees the white figures in the horizontal lines and red figures in the vertical line. The figures are calibrated in degrees to read deviation.</li>
                    <li>Ask the patient to read the figures corresponding to red and white arrows.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                <p>Any deviation indicates an esophoria, exophoria or hyperphoria which can be read on the scale.</p>

                    <figcaption>Prism vergence test</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h4>Principle</h4>
                <p>The actual measurement of the deviation and strength of the muscles involved are tested. The muscles are forced to act with maximum effort against prisms.</p>

                <h4>Method</h4>
                <p>The patient is seated 6 m from a light source and looks at the Maddox tangent scale.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The highest prism which can permit single vision gives the verging power.</li>
                    <li>It is tested in different directions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>The normal converging power varies a great deal. It can be raised to 50 degrees (50°) or more. If it falls below 20 degrees, it is definitely insufficient.</li>
                    <li>The normal diverging power should be 4-5 degrees.</li>
                </ol>

                    <li>Error of refraction is determined and corrected.</li>
                    <li>Exercises to increase the fusional reserve and convergence are advised.

                            <li><strong>Pencil exercise:</strong> A pencil is held in the hand and brought slowly towards the nose until the tip appears double. The two images are then fused into a single image by an effort 8-10 times. This is repeated 3-4 times a day for several weeks.</li>
                            <li>Exercise the weak muscles against prisms.</li>

                <h2>III MANIFEST SQUINT (HETEROTROPIA)</h2>
                
                <p>In manifest squint the deviation of eye is present as such. It is of two main types namely concomitant squint and paralytic squint.</p>

                <h3>1. CONCOMITANT SQUINT</h3>
                <p>It is a dissociation of the eyes wherein the deviation remains the same in all the directions of gaze (Duke-Elder).</p>

                <h4>Etiology</h4>
                <p>In concomitant squint the eyes are not in alignment but they retain their abnormal relation to each other in all the movements of the eye. The efferent pathway, i.e. nerve and muscle are normal. However, the afferent pathway is defective due to poor visual acuity as a result of:</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Defect in the eyes.</li>
                    <li>Breaking down of fixation and fusional reflex.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Types</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Uniocular concomitant squint:
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Convergent concomitant squint</li>
                            <li>Divergent concomitant squint</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Alternating concomitant squint:
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Convergent</li>
                            <li>Divergent</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>1. Uniocular Concomitant Squint</h3>
                <p>When one eye deviates always and the normal eye takes up and maintains fixation, it is known as uniocular concomitant squint.</p>

                <p><strong>Concomitant convergent squint:</strong> In this condition one eye always deviates inwards while the other eye fixes an object. This develops typically in the early life before the binocular reflexes are firmly established, i.e. before the age of 6-8 years. It usually follows an attack of acute illness like measles or other debilitating disease.</p>

                <h4>Etiology</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Defective vision:</strong> It is usually seen in hypermetropia wherein excessive convergence and accommodation is needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Congenital myopia:</strong> Due to congenital myopia the child can only see objects close to the eyes. Thus he is used to excessive convergence causing convergent squint.</li>
                    <li>Opacities in the media such as cornea, lens, vitreous or ocular diseases result in the loss of fixation.</li>
                    <li>Decompensation of esophoria.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Concomitant divergent squint:</strong> In this condition one eye deviates outwards while the other eye fixes an object.</p>

                <h4>Etiology</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>In myopia commencing at a later age:</strong> When the vision in one eye is greatly reduced, it takes up the position of rest which is divergence. The better eye takes up the fixation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complete loss of vision:</strong> A blind eye diverges particularly in adults.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inherent neuromuscular coordination:</strong> It usually starts at the age of 2-5 years.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>2. Alternating Concomitant Squint</h3>
                <p>When one eye fixes, the other eye deviates either inwards or outwards and either of the eyes can take up fixation alternately, it is known as alternating concomitant squint.</p>

                <p>The most important feature of alternating deviating eye is that of completely suppressed image in the brain so there is no diplopia.</p>

                <h4>Symptoms</h4>
                <p>Usually there are no symptoms except cosmetic embarrassment to the patient.</p>
