                <h2>APPLIED ANATOMY</h2>
                
                <p>The lens is a transparent, biconvex structure of crystalline appearance placed between the iris and the vitreous. It is suspended by the suspensory ligament of the lens or zonule of Zinn which is attached to the ciliary body and equator of the lens. The accommodative power varies with age, being 14 to 16 D (at birth), 7 to 8 D (at 25 years of age) and 1 to 2 D (at 50 years).</p>

                <p>The lens is composed of 64% water, 35% protein and 1% lipid, carbohydrate and trace elements. The metabolism of the lens is anaerobic. Glycolysis is responsible for 85% glucose utilization resulting in lactate formation.</p>

                <div class="lens-measurements">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Refractive index</strong> = 1.39</li>
                        <li><strong>The dioptric power</strong> = 15 to 18 D</li>
                        <li><strong>Diameter</strong> = 9-10 mm</li>
                        <li><strong>Thickness</strong> = 4 mm</li>

                                <li>ii. Posterior surface = 6 mm (more convex)</li>
                            </ul>

                        <li><strong>Weight</strong> = 250 mg (approximately). The lens grows in size continuously throughout life. At birth it weighs about 65 mg and by 80 years of age it weighs approximately 258 mg.</li>

                <h3>Structure</h3>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li><strong>Lenticular capsule</strong>—It is a smooth, homogeneous, acellular envelope. The hyaline lens capsule is secreted by the underlying epithelial cells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lenticular epithelium</strong>—It is a single layer of cuboidal cells just deep to the anterior capsule. There is no corresponding posterior epithelium.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lenticular fibres</strong>—The anterior cuboidal cells gradually become columnar and elongated (lens fibres) towards the equator. Anterior and posterior Y-shaped suture lines are formed at the junction of lens fibres.</li>
                    <li><strong>Suspensory ligament or zonule of Zinn</strong>—This consists of transparent, straight and inextensible fibres.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Parts</h3>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li><strong>Lens capsule</strong>—It is a thin, transparent membrane which is thicker anteriorly. It is thinnest at the posterior pole measuring 4 μm (pre-equator region = 14 μm).</li>
                    <li><strong>Cortex</strong>—It lies in between the lens capsule and the nucleus. It consists of lens fibres.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nucleus</strong>—The lens has four nucleus which are formed at different stages of life upto late adolescence namely embryonic nucleus (1-3 months of gestation), fetal nucleus (from 3 months of gestation till at birth), infantile nucleus (from birth to puberty) and adult nucleus (early adult life).</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Functions</h3>
                <p>The main functions of the lens are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>To maintain its own clarity and transparency. The lens (like the cornea) transmits 80% of light between 400 nm and 1400 nm.</li>
                    <li>To provide refractive power to the optical system of the eye. It is responsible for 35% of the refracting power of the eye.</li>
                    <li>To provide accommodation for near vision.</li>
                    <li>Absorption of harmful ultraviolet light.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The lens matter is elastic in nature but it gradually loses its elasticity with age. Lens is avascular and derives its nutrition from the aqueous humour.</p>

                <h2>CATARACT</h2>
                
                <p>Any opacity in the lens or its capsule whether developmental or acquired is called cataract.</p>

                <h3>CONGENITAL (DEVELOPMENTAL) CATARACT</h3>
                
                <p>Developmental cataract may be present at birth or it may occur in early childhood. It has a tendency to affect a particular zone. It is usually stationary but may be progressive.</p>

                <h4>Incidence</h4>
                <p>Congenital cataract occurs in about 3:10,000 live births. Two third of cases are bilateral.</p>

                <h4>Etiology</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Heredity</strong>—It accounts for approximately 25% of all congenital cataracts. The most common cause is genetic mutation, usually autosomal dominant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maternal causes</strong>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Maternal malnutrition, e.g. as in zonular cataract.</li>
                            <li>Maternal infection by virus, e.g. rubella in the first trimester.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Foetal causes</strong>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Deficient oxygenation due to severe placental haemorrhage, e.g. placenta praevia.</li>
                            <li>Metabolic disorders of the foetus or infant like galactosaemia, galactokinase deficiency</li>
                            <li>Chromosomal abnormalities, e.g. as in Down syndrome (trisomy 21)</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Idiopathic</strong>—Unilateral cataracts are usually sporadic and of unknown etiology.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Symptoms</h4>
                <p>It depends on the size and position of the opacity.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If the opacity is large and central in position, there is marked visual impairment.</li>
                    <li>White reflex is seen in the pupillary area (leucocoria).</li>
                    <li>Abnormal movements of the eye due to squint or nystagmus may be present.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Signs</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>White reflex is present in the pupillary area.</li>
                    <li>Plane mirror examination—There is black opacity against a red background.</li>
                    <li>Ophthalmoscopic examination—There is black opacity against a red background.</li>
                    <li>Congenital anomalies which may occur in association with developmental cataract:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Congenital heart disease (patent ductus arteriosus)</li>
                            <li>Microphthalmos</li>
                            <li>Microencephaly</li>
                            <li>Mental retardation</li>
                            <li>Deafness</li>
                            <li>Dental anomalies.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Clinical Types</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Punctate or blue-dot cataract</strong> It is the most common variety. Multiple small, opaque, scattered dots are seen. It does not interfere with vision usually.</li>
                    <li><strong>Zonular cataract</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is bilateral with strong dominant hereditary tendency.</li>
                            <li>Malnutrition and lack of vitamin D may cause zonular cataract along with erosion of permanent incisors and canines. It is the most common congenital cataract.</li>
                            <li>An area around embryonic nucleus becomes opacified and two rings of opacity are seen. The opacity is sharply demarked and the area of the lens within and around the opacity is clear. Linear opacities or riders may run towards the equator.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                </figure>

                <ol start="3">
                    <li><strong>Coronary cataract</strong> It commonly occurs at puberty. It is situated in the deep layers of cortex and superficial layers of nucleus. There are multiple club-shaped opacities near the periphery of the lens usually hidden by the iris.</li>
                </ol>

                <figure>

                </figure>

                <ol start="4">
                    <li><strong>Anterior capsular cataract</strong> It is due to the delayed formation of the anterior chamber. It may occur following perforation of a corneal ulcer in ophthalmia neonatorum cases. It may project forwards into the anterior chamber like a pyramid (anterior pyramidal cataract). The underlying cortex may become opaque (anterior cortical cataract) occasionally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Posterior capsular cataract</strong> It is often due to persistence of posterior part of vascular sheath. Persistence of hyaloid artery may eventually result in total cataract.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Treatment</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>No treatment</strong>—No treatment is required if the vision is good.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mydriasis with atropine</strong>—It is advocated atleast until puberty if the cataract is small, central and the vision is good. Atropine drop is instilled once a week.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optical iridectomy</strong>—It may be done if the opacity is small, central and stationary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lens aspiration</strong>—Aspiration of lens matter can be done as the lens material is soft in children. This is followed by IOL implantation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lensectomy</strong>—In this operation, the lens including anterior and posterior capsule along with anterior vitreous are removed.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>SENILE CATARACT</h2>
                
                <p>This is the commonest type of acquired cataract. It is also known as 'age related cataract'.</p>

                <h3>Etiopathogenesis</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heredity play an important role and it may appear at an earlier age in successive generations. This phenomenon is described as a history of 'anticipation'.</li>
                    <li>The average age of onset is about 10 years earlier in tropical countries like India as compared to temperate climates. This may be due to exposure to sunlight (UV-A, UV-B radiation).</li>
                    <li>Risk factors for cataract include increasing age, diabetes, atopic dermatitis, myotonic dystrophy, trauma, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Cataract is caused by:</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Degeneration and opacification of the lens fibres already formed.</li>
                    <li>Formation of aberrant lens fibres—These are produced when the germinal epithelium of lens loses its ability to form normal fibres as happens in posterior subcapsular cataract.</li>
                    <li>Fibrous metaplasia of the lens fibres may occur in complicated cataract.</li>
                    <li>Abnormal product of metabolism, drugs or metals can be deposited in storage diseases (Fabry), metabolic diseases (Wilson) and toxic reactions (siderosis).</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Classification</h3>
                <p>Morphologically, the senile cataract occurs in two forms:</p>
                <ol>

                            <li>Cuneiform cataract</li>
                            <li>Cupuliform cataract</li>

                <p>It is common to find cortical and nuclear senile cataracts co-existing together in one eye. In general, the relative frequency of cunieform cataract is 70%, nuclear 25% and cupuliform cataract is 5% approximately.</p>

                <h3>SENILE CORTICAL CATARACT (Soft Cataract)</h3>
                <p>It is the most common type of senile cataract.</p>

                <h4>Etiology</h4>
                <p>It occurs due to the degeneration of lens fibres already formed. Any physical or chemical factor which disturbs the intra and extracellular equilibrium of water and electrolytes causes opacification of lens.</p>

                <p>Biochemical changes responsible for cataract formation are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Hydration</strong>—It occurs due to osmotic changes and changes in the semipermeability of lens capsule. The entire lens swells up and becomes opaque.</li>
                    <li><strong>Denaturation and coagulation of proteins</strong>—It leads to the formation of dense, irreversible lenticular opacity.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Incidence</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Age</strong>—It is common after 50 years of age usually.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sex</strong>—Both sexes are affected equally.</li>
                    <li>It is usually bilateral but develops in one eye earlier.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Symptoms</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Frequent changes of glasses occur due to rapid change in the refractive index of lens.</li>
                    <li>Diminished visual acuity—It is gradual, painless and progressive. This is mainly due to reduction in transparency of the lens.</li>
                    <li>Monocular diplopia or polyopia—It is common in cortical spoke - like (cuneiform) opacities along with clear water clefts.</li>
                    <li>Glare—There is increased scattering of light.</li>
                    <li>Coloured halos around light are seen due to presence of irregular refractive index in different parts of the lens.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Clinical Stages</h4>
                <p>In senile cortical cataract presenile changes are the rule.</p>

                    <li>Lens striae—The wedge-shaped or spokes-like opacities (Cuneiform opacities) appear in the periphery of the lens with clear areas in between. They are most common in the lower nasal quadrant. Later their apices appear within pupillary margin.</li>
                    <li>Polyopia may be present due to irregular refraction.</li>

                    <li>Deeper layers of the cortex become cloudy and opaque.</li>
                    <li>Progressive hydration causes swelling of the lens, making the anterior chamber shallow. It may lead to phacomorphic type of secondary glaucoma.</li>

                            <li>Immature cataract—When there is clear lens substance between the pupillary margin and the opacity, the iris throws a semilunar shadow on the deeper lens opacity.</li>
                            <li>In mature cataract the cortex is completely opaque. The iris shadow is absent as iris is separated by only lens capsule from the opaque lens.</li>

                    <li>Nucleus—It is small, brownish and sinks by gravity in the bag of liquefied cortex (Morgagnian cataract). The edge of the nucleus is seen as brown semicircular line. The nucleus alters its position with the position of head.</li>
                    <li>Anterior capsule—It is thickened with deposition of calcium salt on the surface. Later on fluid cortex may get absorbed due to leakage resulting in the formation of membranous cataract with a very small nucleus.</li>
                    <li>Iridodonesis—There is tremulousness of iris as its support is lost due to shrinkage of lens.</li>

                    <li>Subluxation of lens may occur due to degeneration of suspensory ligament.</li>
                    <li>Phacolytic glaucoma may occur due to leakage of lens protein which is ingested by the phagocytes. These large phagocytes obstruct the angle of anterior chamber.</li>
                    <li>Phacoanaphylactic uveities—Lens protein may leak into the anterior chamber which act as antigens causing antigen antibody reaction leading to uveitis.</li>

                <h2>TREATMENT OF SENILE CATARACT</h2>

                <h3>Medical Treatment</h3>
                <p>No medical treatment is effective once opacities have developed.</p>

                <h3>Surgical Treatment</h3>
                <p>The technique of cataract extraction has changed drastically in recent years due to the introduction of operating microscope and intraocular lens implant. However, the modern trend is in favour of extracapsular lens extraction along with intraocular lens implantation. This reduces the incidence of vitreous loss to the minimum with superior visual results.</p>

                <p>The type of operation depends on the individual case.
                In elderly persons the nucleus is hard and it can be removed by the following methods:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE)—It has become obsolete nowadays.</li>
                    <li>Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE)</li>
                    <li>Phacoemulsification</li>
                    <li>Phacolysis.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Choice of Surgical Technique</h3>
                <p>In the modern age ECCE is considered as the procedure of choice. Intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) has become obsolete nowadays. The choice of a particular surgical technique depends upon the following factors:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Age of patient—ICCE is contraindicated (due to presence of strong zonules) below 40 years of age. Therefore ECCE technique is employed in young patients.</li>
                    <li>Availability of surgical facilities—If facilities for microsurgery are available then ECCE is performed for cataracts after the age of 40 years.</li>
                    <li>Surgical skill of the surgeon—If surgeon is trained in microsurgery then ECCE should be performed.</li>
                    <li>Eye camps—Nowadays in eye camps ECCE is performed.</li>
                    <li>Posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) implantation—ECCE is the choice of operation as PCIOL implantation is possible only after ECCE.</li>
                    <li>In high myopia—ECCE should be preferred due to presence of fluid vitreous.</li>
                    <li>In subluxated and dislocated lens—ICCE should be done as the lens is surrounded by vitreous.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>PHACOEMULSIFICATION</h3>
                <p>Phacoemulsification is a sophisticated technique of extracapsular cataract extraction invented by Charles Kelman in 1967. It is the most popular method worldwide and has virtually replaced all other techniques in some well developed countries. This technique consists of breaking down of cataractous lens by application of ultrasonic vibrations. The machine is known as phacoemulsifier which has three functions:</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Irrigation—It is done by a gravity flow system. Balanced salt solution (BSS) is allowed to flow to the handpiece, which is controlled by foot switch.</li>
                    <li>Aspiration—The emulsified material is aspirated through peristaltic or venturi pump as irrigation maintains normal depth of the anterior chamber.</li>
                    <li>Fragmentation—It is performed through a piezo-electric ultrasonic mechanism which activates a hollow 1 mm titanium needle, vibrating at the frequency of 40,000/sec (40 kilo-hertz ultrasonic energy). The amplitude of vibration is 0.038 mm from the resting point of the tip and the total to and fromotion is 0.076 mm (stroke length).</li>
                </ol>

                    <figcaption>Phacoemulsification machine</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h4>Advantages of Phacoemulsification</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Intraoperatively, phacoemulsification allows excellent control of each phase of the operation for cataract removal.</li>
                    <li>The small incision technique involving a self-sealing 'no stitch' or 'sutureless' incision produces very secure and stable wound. There is rapid wound healing and shorter convalescence.</li>
                    <li>Removal of the nucleus occurs through a continuous circular capsulotomy (CCC) with the closed chamber. Aspiration of the cortex also occurs within a closed anterior chamber, with low risks of damaging the endothelium, iris and posterior chamber.</li>
                    <li>Phacoemulsification and small incision surgery are compatible with small size implants, i.e. foldable lenses. There is minimum or no astigmatism with early return of binocular vision.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Disadvantages of Phacoemulsification</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is a difficult technique to master.</li>
                    <li>It requires expensive instrumentation.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT</h2>
                
                <p>This is also known as 'pseudophakia'. The modern trend is in favour of posterior chamber IOL implantation as it offers best optical rehabilitation following removal of a cataractous lens.</p>

                <h3>Biometry</h3>
                <p>Removal of the crystalline lens substracts approximately 20D from the refracting system of the eye. Modern cataract surgery therefore involves the implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL). Biometry offers calculation of the lens power likely to result in emmetropia or a desired postoperative refraction.</p>

                <p>Two ocular parameters are involved in biometry</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Keratometry—The curvature of anterior corneal surface (steepest and flattest meridians)</li>
                    <li>Axial length—The anteroposterior dimension of the eye measured using A-scan ultrasonography.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>SRK formula—It is the most commonly used mathematical formula to calculate the IOL power. It was developed by Sanders, Retzlaff and Kraff and states that</p>
                <p><strong>P = A - 2.5L - 0.9K</strong>, where;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>P is the power of IOL</li>
                    <li>A is a constant, which is specific for each lens type</li>
                    <li>L is the axial length of eyeball in mm (A-scan ultrasonography)</li>
                    <li>K is the average corneal curvature (Keratometry)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The ultrasound machine equipped with A-scan and IOL power calculation software is called Biometer.</p>

                <p>The intraocular lens optic may be monofocal, toric or multifocal, but monofocal lenses with a separate pair of glasses for close work are most widely used.</p>

                <h3>Advantages</h3>
                <p>There is minimum retinal image magnification and early return of binocular vision. It also has cosmetic advantage.</p>

                <h3>Complications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pupillary block glaucoma may result in raised tension.</li>
                    <li>Dislocation of IOL may occur in the vitreous or anterior chamber. Sunset phenomenon occurs when posterior chamber IOL dislocates inferiorly.</li>
                    <li>Cystoid macular oedema, maculopathy and iridocyclitis.</li>
                    <li>Corneal endothelial dystrophy may occur with anterior chamber lens.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>After or secondary cataract is an opacity which persists or follows after extracapsular lens extraction or discission (needling) of the lens. In both these operations, the posterior capsule and part of anterior capsule remains in situ.</p>
