                <h2>Applied Anatomy</h2>
                <p>The vitreous is an inert, avascular, transparent, jelly-like structure which serves only optical functions. It consists of a delicate framework of collagen and hyaluronic acid. It is a hydrophilic gel which becomes "fluid" when its protein basis is coagulated due to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Advancing senile age.</li>
                    <li>Degenerations, e.g. as in high myopia.</li>
                    <li>Chemical and mechanical trauma.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Attachments</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is attached anteriorly to the lens (Hyaloid capsular ligament of Wieger) and ciliary epithelium in front of the ora serrata. The part of the vitreous about 4 mm across the ora serrata is known as the "base of vitreous," where the attachment is strongest.</li>
                    <li>It is attached posteriorly to the edge of the optic disc and macula lutea (foveal region) forming ring-shaped structure around them.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Age Changes in the Vitreous</h3>
                <p>The vitreous undergoes significant physical and biochemical changes with aging.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>At birth‚ÄîThe Cloquet's canal runs straight from lens to the optic disc. It contains the primary vitreous.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Diseases of the vitreous</h3>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                    <li>Opacities in the vitreous,</li>
                    <li>Vitreous bands and membranes,</li>
                    <li>Persistent hyperplastic vitreous,</li>
                    <li>Vitreous haemorrhage,</li>
                    <li>Vitreous loss,</li>
                    <li>Vitreous inflammation,</li>
                    <li>Vitreous detachment</li>
                </ol>
                
                <ol start="2">
                    <li>In young persons‚ÄîThe vitreous gel is homogeneous but its fibres become coarse with the process of advancing age.</li>
                    <li>In old age and in high myopes‚ÄîThe secondary vitreous liquefies (syneresis) and shrinks, producing a vitreous detachment, vitreous and retinal haemorrhage and retinal break.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Function</h3>
                <p>The vitreous forms one of the refractive media of the eye.</p>
                <p>The vitreous does not have any blood vessels. It derives nutrition from the surrounding structures like choroid, ciliary body.</p>

                <h2>Opacities in the Vitreous</h2>
                <p>Opacities in the vitreous may result in marked visual impairment due to 'floaters' or visual loss.</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Developmental causes‚ÄîThe opacities are usually located in the Cloquet's canal and are remnants of the hyaloid system.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>2. Degenerative causes</h3>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                    <li><strong>Muscae volitantes</strong>‚ÄîThese are black spots floating in front of the eye due to minute opacities in the vitreous. They look like small mosquitoes. They are seen in normal persons. They do not cause any disturbance of vision and are harmless.</li>
                    <li><strong>Asteroid hyalosis</strong>‚ÄîThese are unilateral spherical minute, white bodies of calcium soaps resembling snowball. They are suspended in an essentially normal vitreous. It is seen in the elderly and affects both sexes. It is associated with diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolaemia. It is asymptomatic therefore no treatment is required usually. A pars plana vitrectomy may be considered if vision is markedly reduced.</li>
                    <li><strong>Synchysis scintillans</strong>‚ÄîThere is deposition of freely floating, highly refractive cholesterol crystals in the lower part of fluid vitreous. It affects damaged eyes which have suffered trauma or inflammation. Golden shower is seen during the movements of the eye. No treatment is indicated.</li>
                    <li><strong>Amyloid degeneration</strong> - It is a rare bilateral systemic disease with deposition of amyloid in the vitreous and other parts of the body. Retinal detachment and secondary glaucoma may occur at a later stage. It can be treated by pars plana vitrectomy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Other causes</strong>‚ÄîThese include the following common causes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Senile degeneration</li>
                            <li>High myopia</li>
                            <li>Retrolental fibroplasia</li>
                            <li>Wagner's disease</li>
                            <li>Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</li>
                            <li>Marfan's syndrome</li>
                            <li>Chronic cyclitis</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <div class="figure-row">

                <ul>
                    <li>Diabetes and Eale's disease</li>
                    <li>Neoplasm.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Vitreous Bands and Membranes</h2>
                <p>Vitreous bands and membranes are formed after posterior detachment of the vitreous. They consist of hyalocytes, fibrocytes and endothelial cells of the capillaries. They cause oedema, haemorrhage and hole formation in the retina. This is followed by tractional retinal detachment. The central vision is impaired. Metamorphopsia and flashes of light (photopsia) may be seen. Pars plana vitrectomy with epiretinal stripping is the treatment of choice.</p>

                <h2>Persistent Hyperplastic Vitreous</h2>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>There is failure of primary vitreous structure to regress after birth.</p>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>White reflex is seen in the pupillary area shortly after birth.</li>
                    <li>There may be presence of associated cataract, glaucoma, microphthalmos, intraocular (vitreous) haemorrhage.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                <p>It is diagnosed by computerized tomography scanning (CT scan).</p>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Early removal of cataract and retrolental tissue must be done.</li>
                    <li>Lensectomy‚ÄîLens is aspirated with excision of retrolental membrane along with anterior vitrectomy by VISC (vitreous infusion suction cutter) via pars plana approach. Visual prognosis is usually poor.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Vitreous Haemorrhage</h2>

                <h3>Types</h3>
                <p>There are two types of vitreous haemorrhage:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Preretinal or subhyaloid haemorrhage</strong>‚ÄîThe haemorrhage occurs between the retina and the vitreous. The blood remains fluid, red in colour and moves with gravity forming boat-shaped figure in the macular area due to peculiar ring-shaped attachment of vitreous around the macula.</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="figure">
                    <img src="../assets/images/intravitreal-haemorrhage.jpg" alt="Large intravitreal haemorrhage" class="chapter-image">
                    <p class="caption">Large intravitreal haemorrhage</p>
                </div>

                <ol start="2">
                    <li><strong>Intravitreal haemorrhage</strong>‚ÄîThe haemorrhage may get absorbed or degenerate to form a white fibrous tissue mass.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>The common causes of vitreous haemorrhage are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Trauma‚ÄîBy contusion or penetrating injury.</li>
                    <li>Vitreous retraction‚ÄîVitreous fibrous band or membrane retraction.</li>
                    <li>Central retinal vein thrombosis.</li>
                    <li>Eale's disease‚ÄîIt is due to retinal vasculitis and periphlebitis.</li>
                    <li>Malignant hypertension often results in large intravitreal haemorrhage.</li>
                    <li>Blood dyscrasias‚ÄîLeukemia, sickle cell anaemia, purpura, etc.</li>
                    <li>Diabetes mellitus‚ÄîIt is common in diabetic proliferative retinopathy.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Black spots or cloud may be seen in front of the eye.</li>
                    <li>There is impaired vision. It may be reduced to perception of light.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Fundus examination</strong>
                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                            <li>A faint or no red reflex is seen.</li>
                            <li>Grey opacities may be present in the vitreous.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Slit-lamp examination</strong>‚ÄîFresh blood or clotted blood may be seen in the vitreous.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Complications</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Complicated cataract may occur.</li>
                    <li>Retinal atrophy may be present due to haemosiderosis.</li>
                    <li>Retinal detachment may occur due to organised fibrous tissue bands.</li>
                    <li>Profound visual loss may be present leading to complete blindness.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Investigations</h3>
                <p>B scan ultrasonography is helpful in identifying fibrovascular proliferations on the retinal surface and associated tractional or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.</p>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bed-rest with elevation of head is advised in the initial stage. The eyes are bandaged so that there is minimum dispersion of blood in the vitreous. This allows the blood to settle down and helps in locating holes, tears or phlebitis.</li>
                    <li>Photocoagulation‚ÄîIt is done if new vessels are seen in the retina or vitreous.</li>
                    <li>Vitrectomy‚ÄîIt is done after 3-6 months if no visual improvement takes place and when vision is reduced to only perception of light or hand movements.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Prognosis</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Small haemorrhages are usually absorbed.</li>
                    <li>Large or recurrent haemorrhages may lead to retinitis proliferans.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Vitreous Loss</h2>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>Accidental vitreous loss may occur during surgery on the lens, cornea and iris. The vitreous may herniate only in the anterior chamber or may escape outside the eye.</p>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Corneal oedema may be present due to endothelium damage.</li>
                    <li>Updrawn pupil is usually seen due to attachment of vitreous bands to the pupillary margin and corneoscleral section.</li>
                    <li>Macular oedema may be associated with massive vitreous loss.</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="figure">
                    <img src="../assets/images/pupillary-block-glaucoma.jpg" alt="Pupillary block glaucoma" class="chapter-image">
                    <p class="caption">Pupillary block glaucoma</p>
                </div>

                <ol start="4">
                    <li>There may be presence of fibrous bands in the vitreous later on.</li>
                    <li>Aphakic glaucoma may occur at a later stage due to pupillary block or due to presence of vitreous in the anterior chamber causing angle closure.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <p>Anterior vitrectomy by vitreous infusion suction cutter (VISC) or vitreous scissors is performed through a large corneal section after removal of the lens. It is also useful for accidental vitreous loss which may occur during aphakic keratoplasty.</p>

                <h3>Prophylaxis</h3>
                <p>Intraocular pressure is kept low preoperatively by the administration of acetazolamide and application of digital pressure, Flieringa ring, pinky ball, etc.</p>

                <h2>Vitreous Inflammation</h2>
                <p>Vitreous is an excellent culture medium for the growth of bacteria and fungus leading to endophthalmitis and vitreous abscess formation.</p>

                <p>In addition to bacteria and fungi, vitreous abscess with intense eosinophilia may be seen with parasitic infections such as Taenia, microfilaria, Toxocara canis, etc.</p>

                <p>The response of the vitreous to infection is characterized by:</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                    <li>Liquefaction of vitreous gel (synchysis)</li>
                    <li>Opacification of vitreous</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="figure">
                    <img src="../assets/images/vitreous-shrinkage.jpg" alt="Shrinkage of vitreous and detachment" class="chapter-image">
                    <p class="caption">Shrinkage of vitreous and detachment</p>
                </div>

                <h3>iii. Shrinkage of vitreous (syneresis)</h3>
                <p>The presence of white blood cells results in the laying down of fibrous connective tissue and capillary proliferation. This leads to the formation of fibrous bands and cyclitic membrane. Cyclitic membrane often leads to total retinal detachment due to contraction.</p>

                <h2>Vitreous Detachment</h2>

                <h3>1. Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD)</h3>
                <p>It refers to separation of cortical vitreous from the retina anywhere posterior to vitreous base (3-4 mm wide attachment to ora serrata)</p>
                <p><strong>Synchysis</strong>‚ÄîThere is associated vitreous liquefaction.</p>
                <p><strong>Syneresis</strong>‚ÄîThere is collapse of the vitreous due to collection of synchytic fluid between the posterior hyaloid membrane and the internal limiting membrane of the retina.</p>

                <h3>Incidence</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is common above the age of 65 years.</li>
                    <li>It may occur in eyes with senile liquefaction with development of a hole in the posterior hyaloid membrane, e.g. aphakia, high myopia.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <p>Photopsia or flashes of light and floaters are seen.</p>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Biomicroscopic examination of vitreous shows collapsed vitreous behind the lens. There is an optically clear space between detached posterior hyaloid phase and the retina.</li>
                    <li>An annular opacity (Weiss ring or Fuchs ring) representing the ring shaped attachment of vitreous to the optic disc is pathognomic of PVD.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Complications</h3>
                <p>These include retinal breaks, haemorrhage, vitreous haemorrhage, cystoid maculopathy, etc.</p>

                <h3>2. Detachment of Vitreous Base and Anterior Vitreous</h3>
                <p>This usually occurs after blunt trauma. There may be associated vitreous haemorrhage, anterior retinal dialysis and dislocation of lens.</p>

                <h2>Vitrectomy</h2>
                <p>Removal (excision) and replacement of the vitreous is known as vitrectomy. Vitrectomy or excising the vitreous is the most significant advancement in the surgical management of vitreous diseases.</p>

                </ol>

                <h3>Techniques</h3>
                <p>The term "vitrectomy" implies the cutting of formed vitreous gel which is responsible for producing various complications. A variety of vitrectomy units are available. All instruments perform vitreous cutting and aspiration under microscopic control with the help of fiberoptic illumination, e.g. vitreous infusion suction cutter (VISC), vitreous cutter, vitreous stripper, etc.</p>

                </div>

                <p>There are two main types of vitrectomy techniques:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Anterior vitrectomy</li>
                    <li>Pars plana vitrectomy</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>1. Anterior Vitrectomy</h2>
                <p>It is also known as open sky vitrectomy. This is performed through the limbus or a large corneal section after removal of the lens. It is useful for vitreous loss during lens extraction and aphakic keratoplasty. The following are the two main methods:</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                    <li><strong>Sponge vitrectomy</strong>‚ÄîVitreous is cut off by using small triangular cellulose sponges (or cotton swabs) and de Wecker's scissors until adequate amount of vitreous is removed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automated vitrectomy</strong>‚ÄîVitreous is excised from the anterior chamber with the help of vitrector (VISC) or an equivalent instrument. The anterior chamber is reconstituted with an air bubble.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Indications</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Vitreous loss during lens extraction‚ÄîVitreous loss is managed by clearing the vitreous from the incision and the anterior chamber.</li>
                    <li>Vitreous loss occurring during aphakic keratoplasty.</li>
                    <li>Removal of a dislocated lens associated with vitreous loss.</li>
                    <li>Removal of a large foreign body associated with vitreous loss.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vitreous complications in the anterior segment</strong>
                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                            <li>Vitreous "touch" with corneal oedema</li>
                            <li>Aphakic pupillary block glaucoma.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>2. Pars Plana Vitrectomy</h2>
                <p>It is an intraocular microsurgical procedure which involves the insertion of instruments through a very small incision in the pars plana into the vitreous cavity. Vitrectomy through the pars plana approach is the best established procedure. It has many advantages namely:</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                    <li>It avoids both anterior segment and retinal complications as the approach is through the pars plana.</li>
                    <li>There is no danger of scleral collapse as the system is a closed one.</li>
                    <li>Lens removal is not necessary as is required in case of anterior vitrectomy.</li>
                    <li>Operative trauma is minimal as smaller incisions are used.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The aim of pars plana vitrectomy are the following:</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                    <li>Removal and replacement of vitreous gel</li>
                    <li>Repair of retinal detachment along with photocoagulation.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Indications</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Persistent large vitreous opacities affecting useful vision.</li>
                    <li>Severe persistent vitreous haemorrhage, e.g. diabetes, hypertension.</li>
                    <li>Fibrous membranes in the vitreous cavity.</li>

                    <li>Tractional retinal detachment involving the macula.</li>
                    <li>Combined tractional and rhegmatogenous (with retinal break) retinal detachment.</li>
                    <li>Any opacity in the anterior segment such as after cataract and pupillary membrane.</li>
                    <li>Large intraocular foreign body in the posterior segment.</li>
                    <li>Endophthalmitis and vitreous abscess.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Technique</h3>
                <p>It is performed through a surgical microscope allowing coaxial illumination and fine movements by X-Y coupling. Special planoconcave lenses are placed on the cornea to provide a clear image of the posterior third of the eye.</p>

                <p>Microscope attachments allow re-inversion of the image seen.</p>
                <p>Three sclerotomies of 20-gauge size are made at the pars plana, 3-3.5 mm away from the limbus and are use for</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In one, an infusion line is inserted for balanced salt solution.</li>
                    <li>In the second, a fibreoptic light source provides endoillumination.</li>
                    <li>Through the third, a vitrectomy instrument for suction and cutting of the vitreous is inserted.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Any abnormalities in the vitreous can be cleared bimanually under direct vision using the vitrectomy instrument and the endoilluminator as support when needed. Once the visibility of the retinal is restored, the cause for the vitreous disturbance is treated.</p>

                <h2>Vitreous Substitutes</h2>
                <p>The vitreous replacement is necessary for restoration of intraocular pressure, and repositioning of the retina in retinal detachment surgery.</p>

                <p>An ideal vitreous substitutes should be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Optically clear</li>
                    <li>Biologically inert</li>
                    <li>Having a high surface tension.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Various substances have been tried to replace vitreous after vitrectomy such as:</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                    <li><strong>Liquid</strong>‚ÄîNormal saline, BSS (balanced salt solution), silicone oil, hyaluronic acid, sodium hyaluronate (Healon), perfluorocarbon liquids (PFCL), etc. Silicon oil allows better controlled retinal manipulations during operation</li>
                    <li><strong>Gas</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Air is still the most commonly used intraocular gas. It causes internal tamponade, i.e. it replaces the retina firmly against the sclera.</li>
                            <li>Sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>)‚ÄîIt doubles its volume and lasts for approximately 10 days</li>
                            <li>Perfluoropropane (C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>)‚ÄîIt quadruples its volume and last for about 28 days</li>
                            <li>Octafluorocyclobutane (C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>They are used as 40% mixture with air for restoration of normal intraocular pressure.</p>
                <p>Combining agents available for tamponade provide better support to superior and inferior retina simultaneously e.g. semifluorinated alkanes with silicone oil, fluorosilicone and silicone oil and 30% F<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub> with 70% polydimethyl siloxane 1000.</p>

                <p>The purpose of using these vitreous substitutes is:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>To expand or replace vitreous volume.</li>
                    <li>To replace opaque vitreous with optically clear material.</li>
                    <li>To provide internal tamponade, i.e. it pushes back the retina to its normal position in retinal detachment surgery.</li>
                    <li>To mechanically separate epiretinal tissue from the retina.</li>
                </ol>
