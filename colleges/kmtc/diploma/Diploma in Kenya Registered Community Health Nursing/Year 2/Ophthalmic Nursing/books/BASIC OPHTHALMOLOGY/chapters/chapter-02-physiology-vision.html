                <p>Light waves travel at a speed of 300,000 kilometres per second. Light is reflected into the eyes by objects within the field of vision. White light is a combination of all the colours of the visual spectrum, i.e. red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. This can be demonstrated by passing white light through a glass prism which refracts or bends the rays of the different colours to a greater or lesser extent, depending on their wavelengths. Red light has the longest wavelength and violet the shortest. This range of colours is the spectrum of visible light. In a rainbow, white light from the sun is broken up by raindrops which act as prisms and reflectors.</p>

                <h2>The Spectrum of Light</h2>
                
                <p>The spectrum of light is broad but only a small part is visible to the human eye. The visible spectrum extends from 723 nm at the red end to 397 nm at the violet end or roughly 700 to 400 nm. Beyond the long end there are infrared (heat), radar and radio waves. Beyond the short end there are ultraviolet (UV), X-ray and cosmic waves. UV light is not normally visible because it is absorbed by a yellow pigment in the lens. Following removal of the lens (cataract operation), UV light is visible and it has been suggested that long-term exposure may damage the retina.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-019-2.jpg" alt="The electromagnetic spectrum showing visible light range">
                </figure>

                <p>A specific colour is perceived when only one wavelength is reflected by the object and all the others are absorbed, e.g. an object appears red when only the red wavelength is reflected. Objects appear white when all wavelengths are reflected, and black when they are all absorbed.</p>

                <h2>PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION</h2>
                
                <p>In order to achieve clear vision, light reflected from objects within the visual field is focused on to the retina of both eyes. The processes involved in producing a clear image are:</p>
                <ol class="enhanced-list">
                    <li>Refraction of the light rays</li>
                    <li>Accommodation of the eyes to light.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Although these may be considered as separate processes, effective vision is dependent upon their coordination.</p>

            <section id="refraction" class="content-card">
                <h2>1. REFRACTION OF THE LIGHT RAYS</h2>
                
                <p>When light rays pass from a medium of one density to a medium of a different density they are refracted or bent. This principle is used in the eye to focus light on the retina. Before reaching the retina light rays pass successively through the conjunctiva, cornea, aqueous fluid, lens and vitreous. They are all more dense than air and with the exception of the lens, they have a constant refractory power similar to that of water.</p>

                <h3>Lens</h3>
                
                <p>The lens is a biconvex elastic transparent structure suspended behind the iris from the ciliary body by the suspensory ligament. Lens is the only structure in the eye that changes its refractive power. All light rays entering the eye need to be bent (refracted) to focus them on the retina. Light from distant objects needs least refraction and as the object comes closer, the amount needed is increased. To increase the refractive power the ciliary muscle contracts, releasing its pull on the suspensory ligament and the anterior surface of the lens bulges forward, increasing its convexity. When the ciliary muscle relaxes it slips backwards, increasing its pull on the suspensory ligament, making the lens thinner.</p>

            <section id="accommodation" class="content-card">
                <h2>2. ACCOMMODATION OF THE EYES TO LIGHT</h2>
                
                <p>There are three factors which are involved in accommodation</p>
                <ol class="enhanced-list">
                    <li>Pupil</li>
                    <li>Movement of the eyeballs—convergence</li>
                    <li>Lens.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>1. Size of the Pupil</h3>
                
                <p>Pupil size influences accommodation by controlling the amount of light entering the eye. In a bright light the pupils are constricted. In a dim light they are dilated.</p>

                <p>If the pupils were dilated in a bright light, too much light would enter the eye and damage the retina. In a dim light, if the pupils were constricted, insufficient light would enter the eye to activate the photosensitive pigments in the rods and cones which stimulate the nerve endings in the retina.</p>

                <p>The iris consists of one layer of circular and one of radiating smooth muscle fibres. Contraction of the circular fibres constricts the pupil, and contraction of the radiating fibres dilates it. The size of the pupil is controlled by the nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Sympathetic stimulation dilates the pupil and parasympathetic stimulation causes contraction of the pupil.</p>

                <h3>2. Movements of the Eyeballs—convergence</h3>
                
                <p>Light rays from objects enter the two eyes at different angles and for clear vision they must stimulate corresponding areas of the two retinae. Extraocular muscles move the eyes and to obtain a clear image they rotate the eyes so that they converge on the object viewed. This co-ordinated muscle activity is under autonomic control. When there is voluntary movement of the eyes both eyes move and convergence is maintained. The nearer an object is to the eyes the greater the eye rotation needed to achieve convergence. If convergence is not complete there is double vision, i.e. diplopia. After a period of time during which convergence is not possible, the brain tends to ignore the impulses received from the divergent eye.</p>

            <section id="retinal-functions" class="content-card">
                <h2>FUNCTIONS OF THE RETINA</h2>
                
                <p>The retina is the photosensitive part of eye. The light sensitive cells are the rods and cones. Light rays cause chemical changes in photosensitive pigments in these cells and they emit nerve impulses which pass to the occipital lobes of cerebrum via the optic nerves.</p>

                <p>The rods are more sensitive than the cones. They are stimulated by low intensity or dim light, e.g. by the dim light in the interior of a darkened room (scotopic vision).</p>

                <p>The cones are sensitive to bright light and colour. The different wavelengths of light stimulate photosensitive pigments in the cones, resulting in the perception of different colours. In a bright light the light rays are focused on the macula lutea (photopic vision).</p>

                <p>The rods are more numerous towards the periphery of the retina. Visual purple (rhodopsin) is a photosensitive pigment present only in the rods. It is bleached by bright light and when this occurs the rods cannot be stimulated. Rhodopsin is quickly reconstituted when an adequate supply of vitamin A is available. When the individual moves from an area of bright light to one of dim light, there is variable period of time when it is difficult to see. The rate at which dark adaptation takes place is dependent upon the rate of reconstitution of rhodopsin. In dim evening light different colours cannot be distinguished because the light intensity is insufficient to stimulate colour sensitive pigments in cones.</p>

            <!-- START: visual-perceptions -->
            <section id="visual-perceptions" class="content-card">
                <h2>VISUAL PERCEPTIONS</h2>
                
                <p>Visual perceptions are of four types namely,</p>

                <h3>1. Light Sense</h3>
                
                <p>Light sense is the faculty which permits us to perceive light as such and in all its gradation of intensity.</p>

                <h4>Light Minimum</h4>
                
                <p>Light minimum is the minimum intensity of light appreciated by the retina. If the light which is falling on the retina is gradually reduced in intensity, a point comes when light is no longer perceived.</p>

                <h4>Dark Adaptation</h4>
                
                <p>Dark adaptation is the ability of the eye to adapt itself to decreasing illumination. If one goes from a bright light into a dimly lit room, one cannot perceive the objects in the room until sometime has elapsed. This time interval is known as dark adaptation.</p>

                <h3>2. Form Sense</h3>
                
                <p>Form sense is the faculty which enables us to perceive the shape of objects. Visual acuity is a record of form sense.</p>

                <h3>3. Sense of Contrast</h3>
                
                <p>Sense of contrast is the ability to perceive slight changes in luminance between regions which are not separated by definite borders.</p>

                <h3>4. Colour Sense</h3>
                
                <p>Colour sense is that faculty which helps us to distinguish between different colours as excited by light of different wavelengths. Three important factors influence colour vision:</p>
                <ol class="enhanced-list">
                    <li>Wavelength</li>
                    <li>Brightness or luminosity</li>
                    <li>Saturation or calorimetric purity</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The normal colour vision is called "trichromatic" (red, green, blue) and it is the basis of the Young-Helmholtz theory. When red, green, and blue portion of spectrum mix together, they produce white colour. Thus red, green, and blue are known as primary colours. The exact nature of the defect is tested by:</p>

                <ol class="enhanced-list">
                    <li><strong>Isochromatic chart</strong>—These are coloured lithographic plates in which bold numbers are represented in dots of various colours, e.g. Japanese Ishihara lithographic plates, American H-R-R test, Swedish-Bostrom test. Colour blind person finds it difficult to identify the bold numbers.</li>
                    <li><strong>The lantern test</strong>—Various colours are shown by a lantern, e.g. Edridge-Green's lantern. He is judged by the mistakes he makes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Holmgren's wools</strong>—This consists of a selection of skeins of coloured wools from which the candidate is required to make a series of colour matches.</li>

                <p>Binocular or stereoscopic vision has certain advantages. Each eye 'sees' a scene slightly differently. There is an overlap in the middle but the left eye sees more on the left than can be seen by the other eye and vice versa. The images from the two eyes are fused in the cerebrum so that only one image is perceived.</p>

                <p>Binocular vision provides a much more accurate assessment of one object relative to another, e.g. its distance, depth, height and width. This is done by mechanisms of:</p>
