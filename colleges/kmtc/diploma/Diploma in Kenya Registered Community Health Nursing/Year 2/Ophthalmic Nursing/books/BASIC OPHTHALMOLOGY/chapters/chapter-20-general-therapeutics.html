            <section id="introduction" class="content-card">
                <p>There are several therapeutic substances available which are useful in treating ocular diseases. Therapeutic agents can be introduced into the eye, mainly by four methods namely:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Topical instillation</li>
                    <li>Periocular injections</li>
                    <li>Intraocular injections</li>
                    <li>Systemic administration.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <!-- END: introduction -->

            <!-- START: topical-instillation -->
            <section id="topical-instillation" class="content-card">
                <h2>1. Instillation of the Drug into the Conjunctival Sac</h2>
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-458.jpg" alt="Diagram showing topical drug instillation into conjunctival sac">
                    <figcaption>Drug instillation into conjunctival sac</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>This is done in the form of eyedrops, ointment, gels, soft contact lens or membrane delivery. The passage of drug through the corneal epithelium is determined by its fat solubility and the degree of dissociation of the electrolytes.</p>

                <h3>a. Eyedrops</h3>
                <p>It achieves a high concentration and is quickly washed away. More than 80% of the drug enters the lacrimal drainage system after 5 minutes. It is convenient for daytime use as it causes minimum blurring of vision.</p>

                <h3>b. Ointment</h3>
                <p>It has longer contact time but there is lower drug concentration in tears. It causes blurring of vision therefore it is applied at bedtime.</p>

                <h3>c. Gels</h3>
                <p>It also has prolong contact time and may cause less blurring of vision than ointment.</p>

                <h3>d. Soft contact lens</h3>
                <p>It absorbs small molecules of drugs when soaked in the drug. It delivers high concentrations for over about 4 hours.</p>

                <h3>e. Membrane delivery</h3>
                <p>By 'ocuserts' there is relatively constant rate of drug delivery thus reducing the side effects. Pilocarpine ocuserts cause less fluctuation in intraocular pressure as it delivers drug over a longer duration.</p>

                <h3>f. Iontophoresis</h3>
                <p>An electrolyte is given into the eye with the passage of a galvanic current which increases the permeability of the cornea. It is rarely used nowadays.</p>

            <!-- START: periocular-injection -->
            <section id="periocular-injection" class="content-card">
                <h2>2. Periocular Injection</h2>
                
                <p>These include subconjunctival, sub-Tenon, retrobulbar and peribulbar routes.</p>
                
                <p><strong>a. Subconjunctival injections:</strong> They achieve high concentration of drugs and are useful in acute anterior segment infections and inflammations. The drugs which cannot penetrate the cornea owing to large-sized molecules can easily pass through the sclera. Hence a wider range of substances can be introduced into the eye.</p>
                
                <p><strong>b. Sub-Tenon injections:</strong> Anterior sub-Tenon injections are used mainly to administer steroids in the treatment of severe or resistant anterior uveitis. Posterior sub-Tenon injections are indicated in patients with intermediate and posterior uveitis. Depots of crystalline suspensions of corticosteroids lead to high intraocular levels of steroids without systemic side-effects.</p>
                
                <p><strong>c. Retrobulbar injections:</strong> These are used to deliver drugs for optic neuritis, papillitis and posterior uveitis. They are also used for administering retrobulbar block anaesthesia.</p>

                <h2>3. Injection into the Eyeball</h2>
                
                <p>It can be given in the anterior chamber or in the vitreous. It is reserved for desperate cases such as panophthalmitis to flood the ocular tissues.</p>

                <h2>4. Systemic Administration</h2>
                
                <p>Therapeutic substances can be given by mouth or parenterally by intramuscular and intravenous injections. The main factor influencing the intraocular penetration of the drug is the blood-aqueous barrier. It depends mainly on two characteristics of the drug namely:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Molecular weight:</strong> Low molecular weight substances penetrate easily. However, most antibiotics such as penicillin are large-sized molecules and are impermeable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lipid solubility:</strong> A lipid soluble substance such as sulphonamide is 16 times more permeable than sucrose having almost same molecular weight. Similarly chloramphenicol, a lipid soluble antibiotic enters the eye freely.</li>
                </ol>

            <section id="antimicrobial-therapy" class="content-card">
                <h2>ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY</h2>
                
                <p>Antimicrobial agents fall into two general category:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Antibiotics are compounds produced by micro-organisms, e.g. penicillin, tetracycline, etc.</li>
                    <li>Synthetic chemicals, e.g. sulphonamides, ethambutol, rifampicin, etc.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Chemotherapeutic and antibiotic drugs are bacteriostatic (inhibitory) rather than bactericidal (lethal) agents. They act by competing for the raw materials necessary for the existence of the organisms. As these drugs are rapidly excreted from the body or diffuse from local application, their repeated or continuous administration is essential. They are particularly effective in the treatment of acute infections.</p>

            <section id="antibiotics" class="content-card">
                <h2>1. ANTIBIOTICS</h2>
                
                <p>These are substances derived from fungi or other bacterias. Fleming discovered "Penicillin" in the year 1929. In the last few years many such drugs have been discovered such as cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and the various tetracyclines.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Penicillins:</strong> These are effective against gram-positive organisms and certain spirochaetes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cephalosporins:</strong> These are broad-spectrum antibiotics which are relatively resistant to staphylococcal penicillinase.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aminoglycosides:</strong> These are effective against gram-negative organisms and certain acid-fast species.</li>
                    <li><strong>The "broad-spectrum" antibiotics:</strong> These are effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, the rickettsiae, the Chlamydia, certain spirochaetes and protozoa.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>1. Penicillins</h3>
                <p>In general penicillins act by interfering with cell wall synthesis and are all bactericidal. The optimum blood level depends on the sensitivity of the organism. It does not cross the blood-aqueous barrier due to its large molecular weight. It can cause hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria and anaphylactic shock. It shows a synergistic action with antibiotics of the aminoglycoside group. Penicillin eyedrops are useful in superficial inflammation of conjunctiva and cornea. Penicillin is given parenterally in deep-seated inflammation of the orbit or lids.</p>
                
                <p>Penicillins may be classified as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>a. Penicillins effective against coccal infection and gram-positive bacilli:</strong> Benzylpenicillin is not acid-stable and is given only parenterally.</li>
                    <li><strong>b. Enzyme:</strong> Penicillinase resistant penicillins are cloxacillin, methicillin and flucloxacillin.</li>
                    <li><strong>c. Ampicillin:</strong> It can be given both orally or parenterally. It is a broad-spectrum antibiotic as it is effective against most cocci except penicillinase-producing staphylococci.</li>
                    <li><strong>d. Amoxicillin:</strong> It is same as ampicillin in structure and mode of action but has the advantage of rapid absorption. It produces higher and more sustained blood levels. Incidence of diarrhoea is less than with ampicillin and is thus better tolerated orally.</li>
                    <li><strong>e. Carbenicillin:</strong> It is given only parenterally and is effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa particularly.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Cephalosporins</h3>
                <p>These drugs have a similar structure and mode of action as penicillin. Allergy may develop in patients already allergic to penicillin. All the cephalosporins have a bactericidal action against a wide range of organisms.</p>
                
                <p>The cephalosporins have been classified into generations, which indicate improvement in their antibacterial spectrum, stability to β-lactamase and potency.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>a. The first-generation cephalosporins</strong> have a range of activity similar to that of broad-spectrum penicillins but are more resistant to the effect of β-lactamase. They are relatively ineffective against bacteroides species, enterococci, e.g. cephalexin 250-500 mg capsules.</li>
                    <li><strong>b. The second-generation cephalosporins</strong> have greater stability against β-lactamase inactivation. They possess a broader spectrum of activity to include gram-negative rods and anaerobic organisms, e.g. cefoxitin 1-2-10 gm powder.</li>
                    <li><strong>c. The third-generation cephalosporins</strong> or extended spectrum possess a high degree of in vitro potency, β-lactamase stability and a broader spectrum of action against many gram-negative enteric bacteria and anaerobes. They are highly active against Neisseria and H. influenzae. They retain good activity against Streptococcus and pneumococcus, e.g. cefotaxime sodium (Claforan) 1-2-10 gm vial for intravenous and intramuscular use.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Aminoglycosides</h3>
                <p>This group of drugs include streptomycin, kanamycin, neomycin, gentamicin, netilmycin and tobramycin. They are bactericidal in action and are all toxic to the eighth nerve and kidneys. They show a broad-spectrum activity but may cause allergy and bacterial resistance.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Streptomycin:</strong> It is used in the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in combination with a second drug to prevent the development of resistance.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gentamicin and kanamycin:</strong> These drugs may be used parenterally in cases of serious infections by gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. It is particularly effective against penicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci and Pseudomonas pyocyanea. Gentamicin when injected intraocularly may cause severe retinal ischaemia. Topical and subconjunctival administration causes its penetration in the aqueous.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Tobramycin:</strong> It is 2-4 times more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus as compared to gentamicin. Topically it is used as 1% eyedrops. Fortified drops enhance bioavailability and it can also be given subconjunctivally or intravitreally.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Amikacin:</strong> It acts against many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. It is less retinotoxic than gentamicin, but more retinotoxic than ceftazidime. For the treatment of endophthalmitis, 0.4 mg amikacin is injected intravitreally along with vancomycin, which acts synergistically.</p>

                <h3>4. Broad-spectrum Antibiotics</h3>
                <p>Tetracyclines are active against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, fungi, rickettsiae and the Chlamydia including trachoma. They are applied as eyedrops and ointments for superficial ocular infections. They may be used orally in staphylococcal or other pyogenic infections of the lids and conjunctiva.</p>

                <h3>Other Antibiotics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>a. The macrolides and the lincomycin group</strong> include erythromycin, lincomycin and clindamycin. They are effective against gram-positive organisms having resistance or allergy to penicillin. They are given orally.</li>
                    <li><strong>b. Chloramphenicol:</strong> It was originally derived from a streptomyces but it is now synthesized as chloramphenicol. It is a small molecular weight substance and lipid soluble so it enters the eye easily.</li>
                    <li><strong>c. Polymyxin:</strong> It is isolated from Bacillus polymyxa. It is active against gram-negative bacteria, e.g. Pseudomonas pyocyanea, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. SYNTHETIC CHEMICALS</h2>

                <h3>1. Sulphonamides</h3>
                <p>Sulphonamides are bacteriostatic. They prevent the synthesis of folic acid which is necessary for bacterial cell nutrition. They can be applied topically or systemically in the treatment of Chlamydia infections such as trachoma, inclusion conjunctivitis and lymphogranuloma venereum. They are also useful in the treatment of toxoplasmosis along with pyrimethamine. They can cross the blood-aqueous barrier being lipid soluble. The commonly used sulphonamides are sulpha-acetamide, sulphadiazine, sulphamerazine, sulphathiazole, sulphadimidine and cotrimoxazole. Cotrimoxazole is a preparation of combination of trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole.</p>

                <h3>2. Sulphones</h3>
                <p>Oral dapsone is widely used in the treatment of leprosy.</p>

                <h3>3. Para-aminosalicylic Acid (PAS)</h3>
                <p>It may be given by mouth along with isoniazid in the treatment of tuberculosis. The standard treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis now consists of two drugs given together—rifampicin along with either isoniazid or ethambutol.</p>

                <h3>4. Rifampicin</h3>
                <p>It is a bactericidal drug interfering with the metabolism of bacterial nucleic acid. It is given by mouth 450-600 mg daily in a single dose before breakfast.</p>

                <h3>5. Ethambutol</h3>
                <p>It is given in daily dose of 15-25 mg per kg of bodyweight. The main danger is the onset of optic neuropathy, i.e. loss of visual acuity and colour vision which is not reversible even on stopping the drug.</p>

                <h3>6. Fluoroquinolones</h3>
                <p>These are potent synthetic agents, derivatives of nalidixic acid, having broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Mechanism of action:</strong> These are bactericidal drugs. These inhibit bacterial DNA synthesis.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Preparations:</strong> They are grouped into four generations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>a. The first-generation:</strong> Ciprofloxacin and Norfloxacin-These are used topically as 0.3% drops 1-4 hourly.</li>
                    <li><strong>b. The second-generation:</strong> Ofloxacin and Lomefloxacin are the commonly used drugs of this generation, used as 0.3% drops topically.</li>
                    <li><strong>c. The third-generation:</strong> Sparfloxacin is sometimes used in the same concentration.</li>
                    <li><strong>d. The fourth-generation:</strong> Gatifloxacin 0.3% and Moxifloxacin 0.5% have been introduced in this group. For gram-positive infections moxifloxacin is slightly more effective than gatifloxacin but against gram-negative and atypical bacteria, gatifloxacin is more effective. Both achieve high intraocular concentration after topical administration, but none of the two effectively penetrate the vitreous. Oral gatifloxacin has been shown to achieve extremely high levels in the vitreous.</li>

                <h2>ANTIFUNGAL AGENTS</h2>
                
                <p>The available antifungal drugs are mainly fungistatic. They are mainly used in keratomycosis and fungal endophthalmitis. Three groups of agents are used:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Polyenes: Amphotericin-B, nystatin, natamycin.</li>
                    <li>Imidazoles: Ketoconazole, miconazole, econazole, fluconazole.</li>
                    <li>Flucytosin: 5-fluorocytosine.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Amphotericin-B</h3>
                <p>It is too toxic for systemic use, but may be used locally as 0.25% solution (made with 5% glucose) as eye drop at 1 hour interval.</p>

                <h3>Nystatin</h3>
                <p>It is used topically (as 100,000 units/ml) in fungal keratitis. It is particularly effective against Candida.</p>

                <h3>Natamycin (Pimafucin)</h3>
                <p>It is used topically as 5% suspension. It has a fairly broad-spectrum effect, e.g. Candida, Aspergillus, Fusarium. It is used most commonly.</p>

                <h3>Ketoconazole</h3>
                <p>It is a well-tolerated oral antifungal drug. Daily dose is 200-400 mg for at least 14 days.</p>

                <h3>Miconazole</h3>
                <p>It is used topically as 1% ointment 5 times daily. It is not effective against Fusarium.</p>

                <h3>Fluconazole</h3>
                <p>It is also a well-tolerated oral drug and has broader spectrum of antifungal activity. It is used as 200 mg daily for 3-4 weeks.</p>

                <h3>Itraconazole</h3>
                <p>This drug is similar to ketoconazole. It is prescribed for treatment of fungal infections caused primarily by Aspergillus and has moderate effect against Candida and Fusarium infections. It is available for oral and topical use. Oral dose is 200 mg twice daily for a week. Topically it is used as 1% eye drops.</p>

                <h3>Flucytosine</h3>
                <p>It is a less effective agent and used systemically. It is not useful in oculomycosis.</p>

                <h2>HORMONE THERAPY</h2>
                
                <p>Hormone therapy by corticosteroids such as cortisone, prednisolone, ACTH, dexamethasone is not curative. Its main action is to keep the acute phase of inflammation under control while the cure is obtained by other methods. Thus, in infective conditions, cure can be achieved only by antibiotics.</p>

                <p>The main effect of hormone therapy in ocular diseases is of temporary blockage of the exudative phase of inflammation and inhibition of fibrosis in tissue repair whether the disease is bacterial, allergic, anaphylactic or traumatic. It is ineffective in the removal of structural damage caused by chronic inflammations or degenerations. In ophthalmology the steroids can be used locally or systemically.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>a. Local:</strong> Drops, ointments, subconjunctival and retrobulbar injections.</li>
                    <li><strong>b. Systemic:</strong> By mouth, intramuscular or intravenous injection.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Cataract and steroid-induced glaucoma may occur after prolonged use of corticosteroids</p>

                <h2>SUMMARY OF MEDICAL TREATMENT OF IMPORTANT OCULAR DISEASES</h2>
                
                <p>The basic guidelines for the medical treatment of important ocular diseases can be summarized as follows:</p>

                <h3>1. CONJUNCTIVAL DISEASES</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>i. Infective:</strong> Broad-spectrum antibiotics are started initially. Later on specific antibiotics are given after culture and sensitivity.</li>
                    <li><strong>ii. Allergic:</strong> Corticosteroid eyedrops are instilled during day time and ointment is applied at night. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antihistamine drugs can be given.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. CORNEAL ULCER</h3>
                <p><strong>i. Bacterial:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a. Topical application of broad-spectrum antibiotics are started initially. Specific antibiotics are given after culture and sensitivity.</li>
                    <li>b. Atropine drops or ointment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Corticosteroids are not given as they prevent healing.</p>

                <p><strong>ii. Viral:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a. Antiviral drugs, e.g. acyclovir, iodo-deoxy-uridine, etc. are given.</li>
                    <li>b. Corticosteroids are given only in disciform keratitis (deep keratitis).</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>iii. Fungal:</strong> Amphotericin B, nystatin, natamycin, clotrimazole, flucytosine, etc. are given topically. Corticosteroids are not given as they favour fungal growth.</p>

                <h3>3. EPISCLERITIS AND SCLERITIS</h3>
                <p>Corticosteroids, analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs are given.</p>

                <h3>4. IRIDOCYCLITIS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>i. Corticosteroids are given by topical, subconjunctival and systemic routes.</li>
                    <li>ii. Atropine drops and ointment are applied daily to paralyse the ciliary muscle.</li>
                    <li>iii. Potent broad-spectrum antibiotics which cross the blood aqueous barrier are given in bacterial infection (eye drops, ointment and subconjunctivally).</li>
                    <li>iv. Analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs are given to relieve pain. Pilocarpine is not given as it may result in formation of posterior synechiae.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>i. Local:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a. Pilocarpine: It increases aqueous outflow.</li>
                    <li>b. Timolol maleate: It reduces the formation of aqueous.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>ii. Systemic:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a. Oral acetazolamide and glycerol: These reduce the formation of aqueous.</li>
                    <li>b. IV mannitol and urea. These are hyperosmotic agents. Corticosteroids and atropine are not given as they further increase the IOP.</li>
                </ul>
