                <p>The normal eye is like a camera. The focusing elements of the eye are the cornea and the crystalline lens and the 'film' is the retina. The normal eye is so constructed that distant objects form their images upon the retina. The retinal image is inverted but it is re-inverted psychologically in the brain.</p>
                
                <p>When light rays pass from a medium of one density to a medium of a different density they are refracted or bent. This principle is used in the eye to focus light on the retina. Before reaching the retina light rays pass successively through the cornea, aqueous humour, lens and vitreous which are all more dense than the air.</p>

                <h2>EMMETROPIA</h2>
                
                <p>It is the normal optical condition of the eye. The eye is considered to be emmetropic when incident parallel rays of light from infinity come to a focus on the retina (fovea centralis) with accommodation at rest. There is no error of refraction. An emmetropic eye will have a clear image of a distant object without any internal adjustment of its optics. The average power of a normal emmetropic eye is +58 to +60 D.</p>
                
                <p>Most emmetropic eyes are approximately 24 mm in length.</p>

                <h2>HYPERMETROPIA [Far Sight]</h2>
                
                <p>It is that dioptric condition of the eye in which with the accommodation at rest the incident parallel rays of light come to a focus posterior to the light sensitive layer of the retina.</p>

                <h3>Incidence</h3>
                <p>Newborns are invariably hypermetropic (average 2.5 D). The incidence decreases rapidly with age remaining at about 50% after 20 years.</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Axial</strong>-There is short length of the eyeball.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curvature</strong>-There is flat curvature of the cornea.</li>
                    <li><strong>Index</strong>-There is increase in refractive index of the cortex, e.g. as in diabetic and senile cortical cataracts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backward displacement of the lens</strong> as in posterior dislocation of the lens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Absence of lens or aphakia</strong>-It is a classical example of acquired high hypermetropia.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Types</h3>
                <p>Total hypermetropia may be divided into:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Latent hypermetropia</strong>-It is overcome by the normal tone of the ciliary muscle. It is detected only when the ciliary muscle is paralysed by atropine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manifest hypermetropia</strong>-It is detected without paralysing the ciliary muscle.
                        <ul>
                            <li>i. <strong>Facultative</strong>-It can be overcome by an effort of accommodation.</li>
                            <li>ii. <strong>Absolute</strong>-It cannot be overcome by an effort of accommodation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <p>These are noticed specially in the evenings after close work.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is blurring of vision for near work.</li>
                    <li>There may be frontal headache and eye strain.</li>
                    <li>Burning and dryness in the eyes are usually present.</li>
                    <li>In adults, presbyopia commences at an earlier age.</li>

                            <li>A bright reflex, i.e. watered silk appearance may be seen.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pseudopapillitis</strong>, i.e. hyperaemic disc with blurred margin may be present which is similar to papillitis (inflammation of optic nerve head).</li>

                <h2>ASTIGMATISM</h2>
                
                <p>It is that condition of refraction in which a point of light cannot be made to produce a punctate image upon the retina by any spherical correcting lens (astigmatism = a point).</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is unequal curvature of the cornea in different meridians.</li>
                    <li>There is decentring of the lens, e.g. as in subluxation of lens.</li>

                </figure>

                <h4>1. Regular Astigmatism</h4>
                <p>Normally cornea is flatter from side to side (horizontal meridian) perhaps because of the pressure of the eyelids. It is curved above downwards (vertical meridian).</p>
                
                <p>Regular astigmatism is present when the two principal meridians are at right angles. It can be corrected by lenses.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>i. <strong>According to the rule</strong>-The vertical meridian is more curved, e.g. as in normal cornea.</li>
                    <li>ii. <strong>Against the rule</strong>-The horizontal meridian is more curved, e.g. as after cataract surgery.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Sturm's Conoid</h3>
                <p>A regular astigmatic surface is said to have a toric curvature. Thus, the more curved meridian will have more convergent power than the less curved.</p>
                
                <figure>

                <ul>
                    <li>If parallel rays fall upon such a surface, the vertical rays will come to a focus sooner than the horizontal.</li>
                    <li>Both the rays after refraction are perfectly symmetrical but they have two foci.</li>
                    <li>The whole bundle of rays is called the "Sturm's conoid".</li>
                    <li>The distance between the two foci is called the "Focal interval of sturm".</li>
                    <li>If the retina is situated at A to E, the image will be blurred as rays never come to a focus in a single point.</li>

                <h4>2. Irregular Astigmatism</h4>
                <p>It is present when the corneal surface is irregular. It cannot be adequately corrected by lenses, e.g. as following healed corneal ulcer. Soft contact lens may be used. Partial or full thickness keratoplasty may be done depending on the depth of opacity as a last resort.</p>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Diminished visual acuity is the most troublesome clinical symptom.</li>
                    <li>Eye strain and headache after short-time of near work is usually present.</li>
                    <li>The letters in the book appear to be "running together".</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>If there are no symptoms, no treatment is required in low degree of astigmatism.</li>
                    <li>When there are symptoms, suitable cylindrical lenses are prescribed for constant use.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Prognosis</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Regular astigmatism is the only form susceptible to treatment by lenses.</li>
                    <li>Mixed astigmatism has good prognosis as "circle of least diffusion" falls upon or near the retina.</li>

                <h2>APHAKIA</h2>
                
                <p>Aphakia is a condition of the eye where lens has been removed, i.e. absence of lens. It is a classical example of acquired high hypermetropia.</p>

                <h3>Optical Condition</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The eye is hypermetropic. Parallel rays of light reach a focus about 31 mm behind the cornea.</li>
                    <li>There is loss of accommodation.</li>
                    <li>The retinal image is about 25% larger.</li>
                    <li><strong>Astigmatism [against the rule]</strong>-The surgical scar at the corneoscleral junction in the upper part of the cornea flattens the vertical meridian of the cornea.</li>

                </figure>

                <h3>Symptom</h3>
                <p>There is gross dimness of vision because of acquired high hypermetropia.</p>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>A linear semicircular corneo-scleral scar mark is seen in the upper half of cornea.</li>
                    <li>The iris shows peripheral buttonhole iridectomy at or near 12 o'clock position.</li>
                    <li>The anterior chamber is deep due to lack of support of the iris by the lens.</li>
                    <li>There is often iridodonesis or tremulousness of the iris due to lack of support.</li>
                    <li>The pupil is jet black.</li>
                    <li>Purkinje-Sanson 3rd and 4th images are absent.</li>
                    <li>In pseudophakia, i.e. where intraocular lens (IOL) has been placed in the posterior chamber, a peculiar shining reflex is seen through the pupil.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                
                <h4>1. Correction by Spectacles</h4>
                <p>Aphakia is treated by prescribing suitable spherical convex lens (+ 10 D approximately) and convex cylindrical lens (+1 to +2 D at 180°) 6 weeks after the operation, i.e. when the scar has healed completely and the refraction has become stable.</p>

                <h5>Advantages</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is cheap and readily available.</li>
                    <li>It is easy to handle particularly by old persons.</li>

                <h5>Disadvantages</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is 25% retinal image magnification.</li>
                    <li>Spherical aberration causes 'pin cushion effect'. There is greater refraction at the periphery of spherical lens than near the centre. Thus, the incoming rays of light do not come to a point focus.</li>
                    <li>Chromatic aberration may be present.</li>
                    <li>"Jack in the box" ring scotoma is seen due to total internal reflection of light.</li>
                    <li>The peripheral visual fields are reduced.</li>
                    <li>There is difficulty in co-ordination and orientation.</li>
                    <li>Physical inconvenience and cosmetic deficiency is often present.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>2. Contact Lens</h4>
                
                <h5>Advantages</h5>
                <p>There is minimum retinal image magnification, therefore it is useful in unilateral aphakia. It looks good cosmetically.</p>

                <h5>Disadvantages</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Corneal epithelium oedema may occur due to hypoxia.</li>
                    <li>Corneal erosion and ulcer may result from epithelial damage.</li>
                    <li>Corneal vascularization may occur due to constant irritation.</li>
                    <li>Papillary conjunctivitis may occur due to the growth of pathogens.</li>
                    <li>Intolerance and foreign body sensation are common complaints.</li>
                    <li>Loss, breakage and deterioration of lens leads to financial loss.</li>

                <h4>3. Intraocular Lens [IOL] Implantation</h4>
                <p>This is also known as pseudophakia. Posterior chamber IOL implantation is best as they are placed in the normal physiological position of lens.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Intraocular lens is made up of hard material PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) or soft material HEMA (hydroxyethyl methacrylate).</li>
                    <li>Lenses are biconvex or planoconvex measuring 4-6 mm in diameter.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Lens power is calculated by:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>i. Ultrasonography (A-scan) (axial length)</li>

                    <li>iii. Standard calculation tables.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The standard power of +19.5 D of posterior chamber IOL = +11 D spherical lens.</p>

                <h5>Advantages</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is minimum retinal image magnification</li>
                    <li>There is early return of binocular vision</li>

                <h5>Complications</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Corneal dystrophy may occur due to endothelial damage with anterior chamber lens.</li>
                    <li>Dislocation of IOL may occur in the vitreous or anterior chamber.</li>

                <h2>ANISOMETROPIA</h2>
                
                <p>It is the optical condition of the eyes in which the refraction of the two eyes differs in variety and degree.</p>

                <h3>Types</h3>
                
                <h4>1. Congenital</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>i. One eye is emmetropic and the other eye is ametropic.</li>
                    <li>ii. Both eyes are ametropic (either myopic or hypermetropic) but differ in degree, e.g. one eye has refractive power of -2 D and the other eye has -6 D.</li>
                    <li>iii. Both eyes are ametropic but differ in variety, e.g. one eye is hypermetropic and the other eye is myopic.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Acquired</h4>
                <p>It is seen after unilateral cataract extraction. One eye is emmetropic and the operated eye is hypermetropic.</p>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is eye strain due to aniseikonia, i.e. difference in the size of the retinal images.</li>
                    <li>Diplopia or seeing double objects may be present in severe cases and unilateral aphakia.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In low degree, binocular vision is usually present.</li>
                    <li>In high degree (more than 2-3 D), only uniocular vision is present. The other eye may become divergent and take the position of rest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alternating vision</strong>-The hypermetropic eye is used for distance and the myopic eye is used for near.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is treated by prescribing suitable correcting lenses for refractive difference of up to 2-3 D.</li>
                    <li>Contact lenses are useful in correcting aniseikonia, i.e. difference in size of retinal images.</li>

                <p>It is an insufficiency of accommodation due to advancing age (usually 40 years). It is not an error of refraction.</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>There is physiological failure of accommodation due to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hardening of the lens with age</li>

                    <li>Symptoms appear early in persons doing too much close work, e.g. goldsmith, clerk.</li>
                    <li>Symptoms depend on existing error of refraction.

                <h2>DETERMINATION OF REFRACTION</h2>
                
                <p>Determination of refraction is the term applied to the various testing procedures used to measure the refractive errors of the eye and to provide proper correction.</p>

                <p>Determination of refraction is done by the following methods:</p>

                <h3>1. Objective Methods</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>i. <strong>Retinoscopy</strong>-It is done after dilatation of the pupil.</li>
                    <li>ii. <strong>Auto-refractometer</strong>-Refraction is tested automatically using electronic and computer technology.</li>
                    <li>iii. <strong>Keratometer</strong>—It is useful for testing corneal astigmatism particularly.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Subjective Methods</h3>
                <p>Postmydriatic test (PMT).</p>

                <h3>RETINOSCOPY [Skiascopy or Shadow Test]</h3>
                <p>A retinoscope is an instrument that the examiner uses to shine light through the patient's pupil. He observes the reflex formed by the light rays reflected from the patient's retina.</p>

                <h4>Optical Principle</h4>
                <p>When light is reflected from a mirror into the observer's eye, the direction in which the light moves across the pupil varies with the refraction of the eye.</p>

                <h4>Mydriatics in Refraction</h4>
                <p>The pupil is dilated by a suitable mydriatic depending on the age of patient.</p>
                <p><strong>In children</strong>-Atropine ointment application three times a day for 3 days is preferred up to 8 years of age as it paralyses the ciliary muscle. Children have great power of accommodation.</p>
                <p><strong>In adults</strong>-Phenylephrine, homatropine cyclopentolate, tropicamide may be used.</p>

                <h4>Method</h4>
                <p>Retinoscopy is done in a dark room.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The examiner sits at 1 m distance from the patient.</li>
                    <li>The patient wears a trial frame and fixes a spot at the far end of the room so that the light rays entering the eye are parallel.</li>
                    <li>A light is placed behind and above the patient's head.</li>
                    <li>The examiner looks through a central hole in the plane mirror in the patient's eye.</li>
                    <li>The mirror is moved slowly from one side to the other. The direction in which the shadow moves is noted.</li>
                    <li>The horizontal meridian is observed first, and then the vertical.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Observations and Inferences</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>In hypermetropia:</strong> The shadow moves in the same direction as the mirror.</li>
                    <li><strong>In myopia (above -1 D):</strong> The shadow moves in the opposite direction.</li>
                    <li><strong>In myopia of -1 D:</strong> There is no shadow.</li>
                    <li><strong>In emmetropia and myopia of less than -1 D:</strong> There is a very faint shadow moving in the same direction.</li>
                    <li><strong>In astigmatism:</strong> The shadow appears to swirl around (scissor-shaped).</li>
                </ol>

                </figure>

                <h4>Neutralisation</h4>
                <p>When the shadow moves with the mirror, progressively stronger convex lenses are put in the trial frame until,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>i. No shadow is seen</li>
                    <li>ii. The shadow moves in the opposite direction.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This is known as 'the point of reversal'. Similarly, when the shadow moves against the mirror, progressively stronger concave lenses are put in the trial frame until the point of reversal is reached.</p>

                <h3>POSTMYDRIATIC TEST (PMT)</h3>
                <p>In postmydriatic test appropriate lenses as found by the retinoscopy are inserted in the trial frame. Each eye is tested separately. Then the two eyes are finally tested and corrected together for distant vision.</p>

                <p>The correction for near vision by convex spherical lenses is made over 40 years of age usually. It is always undercorrected. It is added to the correction for distant vision.</p>

                <h3>2. Cylindrical Lens</h3>
                <p>It is a segment of a cylinder of glass cut parallel to its axis. The axis of a cylindrical lens is parallel to that of the cylinder of which it is a part.</p>

                <h4>Identification</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>i. Two marks are seen on the lens indicating the axis of the lens.</li>
                    <li>ii. When the lens is moved in the direction of the axis, there is no movement of the objects.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>iii. When the lens is moved in a direction at right angles to the axis<br>
                <strong>Convex cylinder</strong>-The objects move in the opposite direction.<br>
                <strong>Concave cylinder</strong>-The objects move in the same direction.</p>

                <h4>Use</h4>
                <p>Regular astigmatism can be treated by suitable cylindrical lenses.</p>

                <h3>2. PRISM</h3>
                <p>It is a medium bounded by two plain refractive surfaces at an angle to each other. This angle is called, "the angle of the prism". The "base of the prism" is situated opposite this angle.</p>

                <h4>Uses</h4>
                <p>It is used in the treatment of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heterophoria</li>
                    <li>Convergence insufficiency</li>

                <h3>Principle</h3>
                <p>Contact lens alters the vergence power of the anterior surface of the eye.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contact lenses rest on the corneal surface.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types</h3>
                <ol>

                            <li><strong>Disadvantage</strong>-It is delicate and has a short lifespan.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Gas permeable lens</strong>-It consists of mixture of hard and soft material, e.g. CAB (cellulose acetate butyrate), silicone, silicone with PMMA.

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Method of Calculating the Power</h3>
                <p>It is done by keratometry and refraction.</p>

                <h3>Indications</h3>
                <p>They are mainly refractive, therapeutic, occupational and cosmetic.</p>

                <h4>1. Refractive</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>i. <strong>Unilateral aphakia</strong>-It prevents diplopia as there is no retinal image magnification.</li>
                    <li>ii. <strong>Irregular astigmatism</strong>-Soft contact lenses are useful.</li>
                </ul>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-073.jpg" alt="Contact lens curvatures">
                    <figcaption>Contact lens curvatures</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <ul>
                    <li>iii. <strong>High myopia with macular degeneration</strong>.</li>
                    <li>iv. <strong>Keratoconus or conical cornea</strong>-It provides regular corneal surface and mechanical support.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Therapeutic</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>i. It has epithelial healing effect, e.g. as in corneal ulcers, filamentary keratitis.</li>
                    <li>ii. It is used as a vehicle for drug delivery, e.g. soft hydrophilic lens.</li>
                    <li>iii. It prevents symblepharon formation, e.g. as in chemical burn.</li>
                    <li>iv. It encourages natural healing process, e.g. as in descemetocele and wound leaks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Occupational</h4>
                <p>In athletes-There is less chances of serious injury, better optics and wider field.</p>

                <h4>4. Cosmetic</h4>
                <p>It improves the cosmetic appearance specially in young marriageable girls.</p>

                <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Contact lenses are expensive, difficult to handle and manoeuvrable.</li>
                    <li>It is easily lost or destroyed by mucoproteins, fungus and calcium deposits.</li>
                    <li>Hard contact lenses are initially uncomfortable to wear. They cause corneal hypoxia resulting in corneal oedema, superficial punctate keratitis (SPK) and opacity.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Complications</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Conjunctiva</strong>—Allergic or infective conjunctivitis may occur occasionally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cornea</strong>-Corneal epithelial oedema results due to corneal hypoxia.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vascularization results due to hypoxia, infection and foreign body sensation.</li>
                            <li>Ulcer may occur due to improper hygiene and infection.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2>REFRACTIVE CORNEAL SURGERY</h2>
                
                <p>In the recent times the following procedures have been accepted by the refractive surgeons</p>

                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>

                            <th>CORRECTION OF MYOPIA</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td>1. Radial keratotomy (RK)</td><td>-1.0 to -6.0 D</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>2. Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK)</td><td>-1.0 to -8.0 D</td></tr>

                        <tr><td>4. Clear lens extraction (Fucala's operation) with posterior chamber IOL.</td><td>-16 to -26 D</td></tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>Each surgeon may have a preference for a particular procedure depending on economic reasons, availability factor or his own personal satisfaction with the end results.</p>

                <h3>1. RADIAL KERATOTOMY (RK)</h3>
                <p>It is still an excellent procedure for low myopias, i.e. from -1.0 to -6.0 D in young adults. Ideally 4 to 8 cut incisions are given with a calibrated diamond knife up to the level of Descemet's membrane.</p>

                <h4>Principle</h4>
                <p>It decreases myopia by flattening the corneal curvature.</p>

                <h4>Method</h4>
                <p>The central optical zone measuring 3-4 mm in diameter is marked out. With a specially calibrated diamond knife 4-8 deep radial incisions (depending on the degree of myopia) are made up to the Descemet's membrane in between the limbus and the optical zone.</p>
                
                <figure>

                </figure>

                <h4>Indication</h4>
                <p>It is suitable for young adults with stable myopia of -1 to -6 D with minimum astigmatism.</p>

                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>The main advantage of RK is that the optical centre of 3 mm is spared unlike PRK where the optical zone of 6 to 7 mm is reshaped by laser with the fear of residual corneal haze.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost factor</strong>-It is comparatively cheap and almost 1/4 of the cost of PRK.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Uneven healing may lead to irregular astigmatism which is difficult to correct. The person may feel that he is looking through the waves.</li>
                    <li>Weakening of eyeball may rarely lead to globe rupture on minimum trauma.</li>
                    <li>There may be glare at night.</li>
                    <li>Intrastromal inclusion cyst may occur due to radial incisions.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>ASTIGMATIC KERATOTOMY</h3>
                <p>It is an extension of the principles of radial keratotomy. The aim of astigmatic keratotomy is to flatten the more curved meridian by asymmetrical incisional surgery. To achieve this various considerations are kept in mind such as the number and position of the transverse incisions. The main indication is in the management of postkeratoplasty patients. The results are often unpredictable.</p>

                <h3>2. PHOTOREFRACTIVE KERATECTOMY (PRK) BY EXCIMER LASER</h3>
                <p>PRK is the treatment of choice for myopia of -1.0 to -8.0 D. The central part of the cornea (optical zone) is reshaped by the laser after corneal epithelial debridement. PRK uses the computer-controlled accuracy and precision of the excimer laser to sculpt the surface of the cornea, correcting myopia, hypermetropia and astigmatism. As very thin layers of the cornea is removed, PRK does not weaken the eye.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>Excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy directly alters the central cornea</p>

                <h4>Method</h4>
                <p>Excimer lasers (excited dimer) act by tissue modelling (Photoablation). It is a source of far ultraviolet radiation which allows removal of corneal tissue with the accuracy of a fraction of a micron. It modifies and flattens the optical zone of cornea. Laser energy has been used to perform radial keratotomy as the laser incision is more accurate and predictable than a diamond knife incision.</p>

                <h4>Indications</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) for correction of refractive errors.</li>
                    <li>Phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) for corneal diseases such as band-shaped keratopathy may be done.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>The results are excellent with an accuracy of 95% in achieving a +/-0.5 D correction with nil to negligible corneal haze.</li>
                    <li>There are no cuts or weakening of the globe as may rarely occur with RK.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                <p>There may be residual corneal haze in the centre affecting clear vision.</p>

                <h3>3. LASER-ASSISTED IN SITU KERATOMILEUSIS (LASIK)</h3>

                <h4>Method</h4>
                <p>LASIK is a modification of PRK. In this procedure a 160 micron hinged corneal flap is lifted from the central 8 to 9 mm of cornea with the help of a microkeratome. This flap is folded to the side and the excimer laser is then used to remove tissue from the exposed surface, correcting myopia and astigmatism. The corneal flap is replaced back.</p>

                <p>Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK)</p>

                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Patient has good vision at the end of the same day.</li>
                    <li>There is no pain, watering (RK) or corneal haze (PRK) as compared to RK and PRK respectively.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is an expensive procedure and requires greater surgical skill for correction of myopia from -8 to -16 D.</li>
                    <li>Complications of LASIK are related to the corneal flap
                        <ul>
                            <li>Too thin a flap can cause wrinkling of the flap on repositioning.</li>
                            <li>Too thick a flap will leave very little of the corneal stromal tissue to work on.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>4. CLEAR LENS EXTRACTION (FUCALA'S OPERATION) AND PC IOL</h3>
                <p>This procedure can be done for correcting myopia of -16 to -26 D. It is now accepted that a zero power posterior chamber IOL is better than no IOL at all.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>i. It retards posterior capsular opacification.</li>
                    <li>ii. It reinforces the posterior capsule to hold the vitreous phase thus minimising incidence of retinal detachment.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Advantage</h4>
                <p>There is a clear untouched cornea after surgery which is amendable to further treatment by PRK if need be at a later date.</p>

                <h3>EPIKERATOPHAKIA</h3>

                <h4>Principle</h4>
                <p>It is a procedure in which a lenticule of donor tissue is used to alter the surface topography of the cornea.</p>

                <h4>Method</h4>
                <p>The donor lenticule of the desired power is sutured into the keratectomy with 10-0 nylon sutures. It is a surgical procedure whereby unilateral high myopia up to -18 D can be corrected.</p>

                <h4>Indications</h4>
                <p>In myopia-Minus lenticule is used. In aphakia in children-Plus lenticule is used. In keratoconus-Planolenticule is used.</p>

                <h4>Complications</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Intolerable glare may be present</li>
                    <li>Chronic epithelial defects may occur.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>KERATOMILEUSIS</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-077.jpg" alt="Keratomileusis procedure">
                </figure>

                <p>It is a surgical procedure whereby unilateral high myopia up to -18 D can be corrected. A disc of 8 mm × 0.35 mm is removed from the patients cornea using a microtome. This disc is placed on a lathe machine equipped with freezing apparatus and keratomileusis (grinding) is performed. Thus, the surface of cornea is flattened.</p>

                <p>Recently Coherent Schwind laser and fourth generation fractile mask spiral lasers are under trial which will further decrease the corneal ablation time.</p>
