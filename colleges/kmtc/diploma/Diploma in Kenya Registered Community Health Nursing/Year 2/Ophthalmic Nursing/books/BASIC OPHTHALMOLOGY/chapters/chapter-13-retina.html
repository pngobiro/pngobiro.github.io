                <h2>APPLIED ANATOMY</h2>
                
                <p>Retina is the inner most layer of the eye and is derived from neuroectoderm. Retina is a thin membrane extending from the optic disc to the ora serrata in front. It varies in thickness from 0.4 mm near the optic nerve to 0.15 mm anteriorly at the ora serrata.</p>

                <h3>Ora Serrata</h3>
                <p>It is the anterior termination of the retina where it is continuous with the epithelium of the ciliary body.</p>

                <h3>Macula Lutea (Yellow Spot)</h3>
                <p>It is an area 1.5 mm in diameter situated at the posterior pole, about 3 mm to the temporal side of the optic disc.</p>

                <h3>Fovea Centralis</h3>
                <p>It is a small depression in the centre of the macula. The cones predominate in this area. The fovea is the most sensitive part of the retina.</p>

                <h3>Structure</h3>
                <p>It is composed of two main layers with a potential space in between the layers:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The outer retinal pigment epithelium</li>
                    <li>The inner neural layer.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Retina consists of ten layers namely,</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Layer of pigment epithelium</strong>—A single layer of hexagonal cells containing melanin pigment is situated on the outer aspect of retina.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer of rods and cones</strong>—These are the end organs for visual sensation.</li>
                    <li><strong>External limiting membrane</strong>—It lies between rods and cones and outer nuclear layers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Outer nuclear layer</strong>—It consists of nuclei of rods and cones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Outer plexiform layer</strong>—It consists of arborizations of the axons of rods and cones nuclei with the dendrites of the bipolar cells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inner nuclear layer</strong>—It consists of nuclei of bipolar cells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inner plexiform layer</strong>—It consists of synapses of the axons of the bipolar cells with the dendrites of the ganglion cells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer of ganglion cells</strong>—Large ganglion cells are present in this layer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nerve fibre layer</strong>—These are axons of the ganglion cells. These fibres are non-medullated and are continued as optic nerve fibres.</li>
                    <li><strong>Internal limiting membrane</strong>—It separates the retina from vitreous.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Blood Supply</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The choriocapillaris of the choroid supplies the pigment epithelium, the layers of rods and cones and the outer nuclear layers.</li>
                    <li>Central retinal artery supplies rest of the layers of the retina. It is a branch of the ophthalmic artery and is an end artery. It enters the optic nerve on its lower surface 15-20 mm behind the globe. The normal artery : vein ratio is 2:3</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Nutritional support for the sensory retina comes largely from the Muller cell which spans almost the entire thickness of the retina.</p>

                </figure>

                <h3>Venous Drainage</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The inner layers drain into the central vein of the retina.</li>
                    <li>The outer layers drain into the vortex veins through the choriocapillaris.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Functions</h3>
                <p>Visual functions are classified under the term light sense, form sense and colour vision.</p>
                <p>Retinal functions are tested by the following tests:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Visual acuity</li>
                    <li>Visual fields</li>
                    <li>Colour vision</li>
                    <li>Dark adaptation</li>
                    <li>Electroretinogram (ERG) and electro-oculogram (EOG).</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The visual impulses reach occipital cortex after 124 m sec following retinal stimulation.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The central part (macula lutea) consists mainly of cones which are responsible for vision in the day light and for colour vision.</li>
                    <li>The peripheral part of retina consists mainly of rods which are responsible for vision at night.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>INFLAMMATIONS OF THE RETINA</h2>
                
                <h3>Periphlebitis Retinae [Eale's Disease]</h3>
                <p>Eales disease is an idiopathic, inflammatory peripheral retinal vasculopathy which presents with recurrent vitreous and retinal haemorrhages in young males.</p>

                <h4>Etiology</h4>
                <p>There is periphlebitis, i.e. inflammation of the wall of the retinal veins commonly associated with tuberculosis (tuberculoprotein hypersensitivity).</p>

                <h4>Incidence</h4>
                <p><strong>Age</strong>—Young adults (20-30 years) are affected commonly. <strong>Sex</strong>—It occurs in males usually. It is a bilateral condition.</p>

                <h4>Symptom</h4>
                <p>Usually none but there may be sudden impairment of vision due to vitreous haemorrhage.</p>

                <h4>Signs</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Peripheral retinal veins appear thickened, tortuous and congested.</li>
                    <li>Perivascular sheathing of veins is usually present.</li>
                    <li>Peripheral neovascularisation is seen at the junction of perfused and non perfused areas of the retina. Retinal haemorrhages may be seen near the veins.</li>
                    <li>A large vitreous haemorrhage may occur all of a sudden.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Complications</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Loss of vision may occur due to recurrent haemorrhages and vitreous opacities.</li>
                    <li>Retinitis proliferans—It follows large vitreous haemorrhage leading to fibrous tissue proliferation.</li>
                    <li>Tractional retinal detachment may occur eventually.</li>
                    <li>Rubeosis iridis, glaucoma and cataract may develop in late stages.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Treatment</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Treat the underlying cause of inflammation, e.g. tuberculosis or septic foci.</li>
                    <li>Systemic corticosteroids are helpful in controlling the inflammation in early vasculitic stage.</li>
                    <li>Photocoagulation of leaking areas prevents retinal hypoxia.</li>
                    <li>Vitrectomy with division of fibrous bands is recommended in cases of retinitis proliferans.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Prognosis</h4>
                <p>It is bad if the condition is bilateral and in cases of recurrence.</p>

            <section id="central-serous" class="content-card">
                <h2>CENTRAL SEROUS RETINOPATHY (CSR)</h2>
                
                <p>It is characterized by a localised detachment of the sensory retina at the macula secondary to local defect in the retinal pigment epithelium. It is a typical example of macular oedema.</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>There is exudation from the parafoveal or choroidal capillaries due to angiospasm and hyperpermeability which may be allergic or toxic in nature. This results due to vasomotor instability.</p>

                <h3>Incidence</h3>
                <p>Healthy young male adults are usually affected.</p>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is transient and sudden impairment of central vision or visual acuity.</li>
                    <li>Black patch is seen in front of the patient's eyes (positive scotoma).</li>
                    <li>Micropsia or metamorphopsia may be present.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Circular grey swelling about the size of the optic disc is seen over the macular region. This is due to shallow detachment of sensory macular retina.</li>
                    <li>There may be ring-shaped reflex or "halo" around the swelling.</li>
                </ol>

                </figure>

                <h3>Complications</h3>
                <p>There may be geographic atrophy of pigment epithelium and choriocapillaries, fibrovascular scar formation and tears in the retinal pigment epithelium.</p>

                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                <p><strong>Fluorescein angiography</strong>—It reveals leakage of dye through a defect in the Bruch's membrane into the subretinal space. Two patterns are commonly seen.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Ink-blot pattern</strong>—There are small hyperfluorescent spots which gradually increase in size.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smoke-stack pattern</strong>—There is a small hyperfluorescent spot which spreads vertically like a smoke stack and then gradually spread laterally to look like mushroom or umbrella.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Reassurance is the only treatment in majority of patients as 80-90 percent cases resolve spontaneously within 4-12 weeks.</li>
                    <li>Photocoagulation is effective in controlling the exudation process in long standing cases with marked loss of vision or recurrent cases.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Prognosis</h3>
                <p>It is usually good in majority of cases.</p>

                <p>It is a congenital anomaly of the vasculature of the retina.</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>This is the most severe form of retinal telangiectasia with intraretinal and subretinal exudation.</p>

                <h3>Incidence</h3>
                <p>It is common in young boys who are otherwise apparently healthy. It is often unilateral.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>A large yellowish-white raised area or several smaller areas are seen posterior to the retinal vessels. At times cholesterol crystals are seen embedded in the exudates.</li>

                <h2>PHOTORETINITIS (Retinitis from Bright Light)</h2>
                
                <p>Retinitis from bright light occurs after exposure of the eyes to bright sunlight as in looking at the eclipse of the sun unguarded (eclipse blindness), exposure to the flash of the short circuiting of a strong current. Almost all the visible rays and many infrared rays (wavelength above 700 nm) are absorbed by the pigment epithelium causing severe retinal burn.</p>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <p>There is persistence of after-image which leads to positive scotoma.</p>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>A pale spot is seen at the fovea with a brown ring around it.</li>
                    <li>Later on there is pigment deposition and retinal hole formation at the foveal region.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Prophylaxis</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Glasses impervious to infrared and ultraviolet rays should be used while looking at solar eclipse.</li>
                    <li>Light source must be seen by reflection from a mirror or not at all.</li>

                <h2>VASCULAR LESIONS OF THE RETINA - RETINAL HAEMORRHAGES</h2>
                
                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Trauma</strong>—Blunt or penetrating injury of the eye is a common cause.</li>
                    <li><strong>Venous obstruction</strong>, e.g. as in central retinal vein occlusion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vascular retinopathies</strong> due to diabetes, hypertension, toxemia of pregnancy, nephritis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blood dyscrasias</strong> such as anaemia, purpura, leukemia, etc.</li>
                </ol>

                </figure>

                <h3>Types</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Intraretinal haemorrhage</strong>—When the haemorrhage from the retinal vessels is small and situated within the retinal tissue, it is known as intraretinal haemorrhage.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Flame-shaped</strong>—It occurs when the haemorrhage is in the nerve fibre layer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Round or irregular shape</strong>—It occurs when the haemorrhage is in deeper layers, i.e. in the outer part of the inner nuclear layer (Duke-Elder).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Preretinal or subhyaloid haemorrhage</strong>—It occurs when a large vessel bleeds. The blood breaks the internal limiting membrane and the haemorrhage lies between the retina and vitreous. It commonly occurs in the macular area and is globular or boat-shaped. However, due to gravity the upper margin becomes horizontal after a few days as a result of sedimentation of red blood cells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vitreous haemorrhage</strong>—Large retinal haemorrhage breaks into the vitreous. It may lead to proliferation of fibrous tissue.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Course</h3>
                <p>The haemorrhages are usually absorbed in due course of time.</p>

                <h2>CENTRAL RETINAL ARTERY OCCLUSION</h2>
                
                <p>It is an ocular emergency. There is obstruction to the arterial circulation of the retina.</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>It is usually due to an embolus or thrombosis along with spasm of the artery. It commonly occurs in cases of hypertension, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, temporal arteritis or Buerger's disease.</p>

                <h3>Pathogenesis</h3>
                <p>Arterial ischaemia results in the:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Infarction of the inner two-third of the retina.</li>
                    <li>Reflex constriction of the whole retinal arterial blood vessels.</li>
                    <li>Stasis in the retinal capillaries.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Site of Occlusion</h3>
                <p>The common site of origin of embolus is from common carotid artery in the neck, aorta or endocardium of the heart.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Central retinal artery</strong>—The occlusion occurs at the lamina cribrosa. Thus, the entire retina is affected. The occlusion is usually at the bifurcation. It is invariably due to atheromatous embolus which is visible as a pale refractile body within the artery (Hollenhorst plaque).</li>
                    <li><strong>Peripheral branch</strong>—The occlusion results in typical sector-shaped field defect. Superior temporal branch is affected most commonly. The distal area of the retina supplied by the vessel becomes oedematous.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is sudden, complete and permanent loss of vision.</li>
                    <li>At times some central vision may persist due to presence of cilioretinal artery which supplies the macular area.</li>
                    <li><strong>Amaurosis fugax</strong>—In the early stage, there is sudden but transient loss of vision. The recovery of vision is due to the dislodgement of embolus into the peripheral arterioles.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <h4>1. Fundus Examination</h4>
                <h5>i. In complete block</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>The arteries are extremely thin and may not be visible.</li>
                    <li>The veins are usually normal except at the disc where they are contracted.</li>
                    <li>The retina becomes opaque and milky white specially near the disc and macula.</li>
                    <li>Cherry red spot is seen at the fovea centralis. Choroid is seen through the thin fovea.</li>
                    <li>Optic disc is pale due to ischaemia.</li>
                </ul>

                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-318.jpg" alt="Central retinal artery occlusion">
                    <figcaption>Central retinal artery occlusion</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h5>ii. In partial or incomplete block</h5>
                <p>The column of venous blood may break into red beads separated by clear interspaces which move to and fro (cattle truck appearance) by gentle pressure on the eyeball.</p>

                <h5>iii. Obstruction of a branch</h5>
                <p>Sector-shaped retinal pallor results with narrowing of one branch. Superior temporal branch is affected most commonly at the bifurcation.</p>

                <h4>2. Pupil</h4>
                <p>It is widely dilated and does not react to light.</p>

                <h3>Differential diagnosis of cherry red spot</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Tay-Sachs disease</li>
                    <li>Niemann-Pick disease</li>
                    <li>Myoclonus</li>
                    <li>Berlin's oedema</li>
                    <li>Macular hole or haemorrhage.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Complication</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Complete blindness may occur due to cystic or disciform degeneration of the macula.</li>
                    <li>It may cause thrombotic or neovascular glaucoma due to retinal ischaemia.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <p>It is an ophthalmic emergency. Prompt treatment is essential as anoxic retina is irreversibly damaged in about 90 minutes.</p>

                <p>It is usually ineffective. In early stages the aim of the treatment is to relieve spasm and to remove the embolus into a peripheral branch of central retinal artery.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Vasodilators, e.g. amyl nitrate inhalation, injection of acetylcholine into Tenon's capsule immediately has been advised but with little success.</li>
                    <li>Massage the globe along with IV acetazolamide—This helps in dislodging the embolus mechanically.</li>
                    <li>Paracentesis—It produces immediate hypotony causing vasodilatation.</li>
                    <li>Inhalation of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide mixture.</li>
                    <li>Panretinal photocoagulation with argon, krypton, diode, etc. laser prevents neovascularisation.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION</h2>
                
                <p>There is obstruction to the venous circulation of the retina due to thrombosis or embolus.</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>It commonly occurs in elderly persons with cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis and diabetes.</li>
                    <li>In young persons it is usually caused by infective periphlebitis (branch occlusion) and local causes such as orbital cellulitis or facial erysipelas.</li>
                    <li>Chronic open angle glaucoma may be a contributing factor.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Site of Occlusion</h3>
                <p>It is just behind the lamina cribrosa where artery and vein share a common sheath. A peripheral branch alone may be involved.</p>

                <h3>Symptom</h3>
                <p>There is sudden onset of impaired vision. However, the loss of vision is not so sudden as in central retinal artery occlusion.</p>
