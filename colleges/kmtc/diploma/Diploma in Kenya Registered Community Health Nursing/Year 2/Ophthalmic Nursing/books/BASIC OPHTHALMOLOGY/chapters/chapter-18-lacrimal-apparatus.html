                <h2>APPLIED ANATOMY</h2>
                
                <p>The lacrimal apparatus for each eye consists of secretory and excretory parts:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Secretory system</strong>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Lacrimal gland and its ducts</li>
                            <li>Accessory lacrimal glands</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Excretory system</strong>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Lacrimal puncta</li>
                            <li>Lacrimal canaliculi</li>
                            <li>Lacrimal sac</li>
                            <li>Nasolacrimal duct</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Lacrimal Glands</h3>
                <p>These are serous glands situated at the upper and outer angle of the orbit, in a depression known as the fossa for the lacrimal gland. Each gland is approximately the size and shape of an almond. It is composed of secretory epithelial cells. Anteriorly the gland is divided into two parts-the upper orbital part and the lower palpebral part. The ducts of the lacrimal gland which are about 12 in number open in the fornix of the upper lid. The glands secrete tears composed of water, salt and lysozyme, a bactericidal enzyme.</p>

                <h3>Accessory Lacrimal Glands</h3>
                <p>These are very small glands of exactly the same structure as the lacrimal glands.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Glands of Krause</strong> - These are about 20 in number in the upper lid and about 8 in the lower lid situated within the stroma of the conjunctiva mainly near the fornix.</li>
                    <li><strong>Glands of Wolfring</strong> - These are few in number situated near the upper border of tarsal plate.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Lacrimal Puncta</h3>
                <p>These are two small openings situated on a small elevation called lacrimal papilla, about 6 mm from the inner canthus on each lid margin.</p>

                <h3>Lacrimal Canaliculi</h3>
                <p>These are narrow tubular passages which lie one above the other being separated by a small body, the caruncle. The two canaliculi may open separately in the lacrimal sac or may join to form a common canaliculi.</p>

                </figure>

                <h3>Lacrimal Sac</h3>
                <p>It is a cystic structure lined with columnar epithelium. It is situated in the lacrimal fossa formed by the lacrimal bone and the frontal process of the maxilla. It is about 15 mm in length and 5 mm wide when distended. The portion of the sac above the opening of the canaliculi is known as the fundus. The sac is continuous with the nasolacrimal duct inferiorly.</p>

                <h3>Nasolacrimal Duct</h3>
                <p>It is a membranous canal approximately 2 cm long extending from lower part of the sac to the inferior meatus of the nose.</p>

                <h3>Blood Supply of the Lacrimal Gland</h3>
                <p>The arterial supply is by the lacrimal branch of the ophthalmic artery and infraorbital branch of the maxillary artery. The venous drainage is by the lacrimal vein which opens into the superior ophthalmic vein.</p>

                <h3>Lymphatic Drainage</h3>
                <p>The lymph vessels join the conjunctival and palpebral lymphatics and pass to the preauricular nodes.</p>

                <h3>Nerve Supply</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Sensory nerve</strong> - The lacrimal branch of the ophthalmic division of the 5th nerve.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sympathetic supply</strong> - The carotid plexus of the cervical sympathetic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secretomotor fibres</strong> - These are derived from the facial nerve via the sphenopalatine ganglion.</li>
                </ol>

            <section id="tears" class="content-card">
                <h2>TEARS</h2>
                
                <p>Tear is a secretion from the lacrimal gland. It is slightly alkaline and consists mainly of water, small quantities of salts, such as sodium chloride, sugar, urea, protein and lysozyme, a bactericidal enzyme. The secretion of tear does not begin before 3-4 weeks after birth. The average normal secretion of tears is 0.5-2.2 ml. The normal pH of tear is 7.5.</p>

                <h3>The Tear Film</h3>
                <p>The fluid which fills the conjunctival sac consists of 3 layers namely:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Mucous layer</strong> - A hydrated layer of mucoproteins secreted by the goblet cells, crypts of Henle and glands of Manz.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aqueous layer</strong> - It consists of tears secreted by the lacrimal gland and accessory lacrimal glands, e.g. glands of Krause and Wolfring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lipid layer</strong> - It consists mainly of cholesterol, esters and lipid being secreted by the meibomian glands and Zeis glands.</li>
                </ol>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-436.jpg" alt="Tear film structure showing three distinct layers">
                    <figcaption>Structure of tear film</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Functions</h3>
                <p>The surface of the eyeball must remain wet for comfort and normal functioning. The tear film spreads over the surface of corneal epithelium by gravity, capillary action and blinking of the eyelids.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It washes away irritating material, e.g. dust and grit. It contains protective substances such as lysozyme, immunoglobulin, lactoferrin, compliments.</li>
                    <li>The bactericidal lysozyme (muramidase) prevents microbial infection.</li>
                    <li>The oiliness of this mixed fluid delays evaporation and prevents drying of the conjunctiva and cornea.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Normally, the rate of secretion of tears keeps pace with the rate of drainage. When a foreign body or other irritant enters the eye, the secretion of tears is greatly increased and the conjunctival vessels dilate. Secretion of tears is also increased in emotional stress states.</p>

                <h2>ACUTE DACRYO-ADENITIS</h2>
                
                <p>It is an acute inflammation of the lacrimal gland.</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>It is a rare condition occurring in association with mumps, influenza, infectious mononucleosis, etc. sometimes leading to suppuration and fistula formation.</p>

                <h3>Symptom</h3>
                <p>There is marked pain, redness and swelling in the upper and outer angle of the orbit along with excessive watering of the eye.</p>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>A tender swelling is present at the outer part of the upper lid spreading towards the temple and cheeks.</li>
                    <li>There is congestion and chemosis of the conjunctiva in upper part.</li>
                    <li>Preauricular glands may be enlarged and tender.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Complications</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Suppuration leads to abscess and fistula formation.</li>
                    <li>There may be cystic degeneration and atrophy of the gland resulting in dry eye.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Differential Diagnosis</h3>
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>Acute dacryo-adenitis Both eyes</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>It should be differentiated from lid abscess, stye, suppurative chalazion, acute purulent conjunctivitis, orbital cellulitis and osteomyeliltis of frontal bone.</p>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Hot compresses are applied several times a day.</li>
                    <li>Systemic broad-spectrum antibiotics are given in full doses.</li>
                    <li>Incision and drainage is done in cases of abscess formation.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>DACRYOPS</h3>
                <p>It is a cystic swelling of the lacrimal gland due to retention of lacrimal secretion as a result of blockage of one of the lacrimal ducts.</p>

                <h3>MIKULICZ'S SYNDROME</h3>
                <p>There is symmetrical enlargement of the lacrimal and salivary glands (parotid glands) usually with lymphoid tissue hyperplasia. The etiology is unknown but it is seen in uveoparotid inflammations.</p>

                <h3>TUMOURS</h3>
                <h4>Benign Tumour</h4>
                <p>The most common tumour is pleomorphic adenocarcinoma (mixed tumour). The benign mixed tumour usually occurs in middle life. It presents as a slowly progressive painless swelling in the upper lid. It may result in mechanical ptosis. It should be excised.</p>

                <h4>Malignant Tumour</h4>
                <p>The malignant tumour presents with a short history and pain. If malignant, radical surgical removal is necessary.</p>

                <h3>CONGENITAL DACRYOCYSTITIS (DACRYOCYSTITIS IN THE NEWBORN)</h3>
                <p>Inflammation of the lacrimal sac in the newborn may present as an acute or chronic process.</p>

                <h4>Etiology</h4>
                <p>There is failure in canalization of the nasolacrimal duct, the lumen being blocked by epithelial debris. It may be a bilateral condition.</p>

                <h4>Symptom</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is epiphora or continuous watering of the eyes usually evident in 2nd week of life. Normally, the tears are secreted after 3-4 weeks after birth.</li>
                    <li>There may be purulent discharge or conjunctivitis in infected cases.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Signs</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Stricky mucopurulent discharge and persistent epiphora are two important signs.</li>
                    <li>There is regurgitation of mucopurulent discharge on pressure over the sac area.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Treatment</h4>
                <h5>1. Conservative treatment is indicated in early cases.</h5>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li><strong>Massage over the lacrimal sac area</strong> and clean the discharge several times a day. This constitutes the treatment of congenital nasolacrimal duct block up to 6-8 weeks of age.
                        <p><strong>Method</strong> - Teach the mother to apply pressure over the sac area by the thumb. Then bring the thumb downward pressing towards the ala of the nose. This is repeated 3-4 times thrice daily. Massage increases the hydrostatic pressure in the sac and helps to open up the membranous occlusions. It should be carried out at least 3 times a day to be followed by instillation of antibiotic drops.</p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                    </li>
                    <li>Broad-spectrum antibiotic eyedrops are instilled frequently after expressing the contents of the sac by pressure over the sac area. Most cases (90%) are cured by this treatment.</li>
                </ol>

                <h5>2. Surgical treatment</h5>
                <p><strong>Aim</strong> - To recanalise the nasolacrimal duct.</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Probing of the nasolacrimal duct.</li>
                    <li>Intubation with silicone tube - This may be performed if repeated probing is a failure. The silicone tube should be kept in the nasolacrimal duct for about six months.</li>
                    <li>Balloon dilatation of the duct may be tried.</li>
                    <li>Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) operation. When the condition fails to respond up to 4 years of age, DCR operation should be performed.</li>

                <h4>Probing of Nasolacrimal Duct</h4>
                <p>If there is no improvement after three months, probing of the nasolacrimal duct is performed through the upper punctum under general anesthesia. Great care is taken to avoid injury to the walls of the duct as it may cause fibrosis or infection.</p>

                <h5>Method</h5>
                <p>The punctum and canaliculus are dilated with a Nettleship's dilator. A small probe No 1 or 2 is inserted vertically downwards into the canaliculus. It is gently but firmly passed inwards until lacrimal bone is felt. The probe is then rotated towards the middle line and pushed down the nasal duct till it reaches the floor of the nose. This procedure will cure most congenital cases.</p>

                <h2>ACUTE DACRYOCYSTITIS</h2>
                
                <p>It is the acute suppurative inflammation of the lacrimal sac.</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>It usually occurs as an acute exacerbation of the chronic dacryocystitis. It may start spontaneously. It is caused by pyogenic pathogens such as Pneumococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, etc.</p>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is marked swelling, redness and tenderness of the skin over the sac and adjacent area.</li>
                    <li>No regurgitation is present as the canaliculi are blocked due to oedema.</li>
                    <li>Conjunctival congestion and submaxillary lymph node enlargement may be present.</li>
                    <li>Fluctuation is present on palpation over the sac area when there is abscess formation.</li>
                    <li>Lacrimal fistula may be present if the abscess bursts open repeatedly.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>CHRONIC DACRYOCYSTITIS</h2>
                
                <p>It is a common chronic suppurative inflammation of the lacrimal sac that usually results from obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct. It is of clinical importance as hypopyon or even panophthalmitis may occur after intraocular surgery.</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>It is usually due to stricture of the nasal duct as a result of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chronic inflammation of the nasal mucosa.</li>
                    <li>Pressure of nasal polypi.</li>
                    <li>Hypertrophied inferior turbinate bone.</li>
                    <li>Extreme deviation of the nasal septum.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The stagnant sac content gets infected by pyogenic bacterias such as Pneumococcus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and rarely by a fungus called rhinosporiodosis.</p>

                <h3>COMMON CAUSES OF EPIPHORA</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Congenital absence of lacrimal puncta.</li>
                    <li>Congenital non-canalization or delayed canalization of nasolacrimal duct.</li>
                    <li>Occlusion of puncta-foreign body, hair, etc.</li>
                    <li>Chronic dacryocystitis with blockage of nasolacrimal duct.</li>
                    <li>Growth or inflammation of inferior meatus.</li>
                    <li>Functional insufficiency for draining the tear in to the nose, e.g. Bell's palsy, ectropion.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Types</h3>
                <p>There are three common types:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Catarrhal</strong> - There is watery discharge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mucocele</strong> - Presence of swelling at the sac region and positive regurgitation test are diagnostic of mucocele.</li>
                    <li><strong>Suppurative</strong> - Lacrimal abscess results from pyogenic infection.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Incidence</h3>
                <p>It occurs commonly in adults, more so in women after 40 years of age. It may be unilateral or bilateral.</p>

                <h3>Pathogenesis</h3>
                <p>There are two main factors resulting in a vicious cycle:</p>

                    <figcaption>Chronic dacryocystitis</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Stasis of sac content</strong> - The anatomical factors responsible for stasis are narrow lumen of nasolacrimal duct.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infection</strong> - It may ascend from nose, descend from conjunctiva or spread from vicinity.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is constant epiphora or passive overflow of tears over the lid margin which is aggravated by exposure to wind.</li>
                    <li>There is swelling, pain and redness at the site of the sac (mucocele) in cases of acute or recurrent infection.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Persistent congestion of the neighbouring conjunctiva, caruncle and skin may be seen.</li>
                    <li>Regurgitation of mucopurulent fluid by pressure over the sac area is present.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Sequela</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Non-healing corneal ulcer or hypopyon corneal ulcer may occur.</li>
                    <li>Panophthalmitis may result following intraocular surgery.</li>
                    <li>Atonic sac - The contents of the atonic sac can be evacuated by external pressure only.</li>
                    <li>Lacrimal abscess may occur following probing or spontaneously due to pyogenic infection.</li>
                    <li>Lacrimal fistula may occur if the abscess bursts open repeatedly. The fistulous track is lined by the epithelium which prevent healing.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Investigations</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Nasal examination is important to exclude deviation of septum, growth and atrophic rhinitis to judge the success of DCR operation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Radiological examination</strong> - The lacrimal passage is visualized radiographically by:
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Dacryocystography (DCG) is done using lipiodol, urografin, conray, iodized oil, etc. It outlines the lacrimal excretory passage. X-ray is taken immediately and after 10-15 minutes to find out the size of the sac and site of obstruction.</li>
                            <li>Subtraction macrodacryocystography with canalicular catheterization is a more accurate diagnostic technique.</li>
                            <li>Radioactive tracer containing sulphur is instilled into the conjunctival sac and its excretion is visualized by gamma camera.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <h4>1. In recent cases</h4>
                <p>Repeating syringing of the nasolacrimal duct and frequent instillation of antibiotic drops is indicated in recent cases. It is indicated for two purposes:</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li><strong>Diagnostic</strong> - It confirms the block in the lacrimal passage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Therapeutic</strong> - Syringing is curative in early cases by separating the oedematous mucosal walls sticking together and by clearing the mucosal debris.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Principle</strong> - It reduces the swelling of the inflamed mucosa and restores the patency of lacrimal excretory passage by clearing the epithelial debris.</p>

                <h5>Method</h5>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Conjunctival sac is anaesthetized by frequent instillation of topical xylocaine or other suitable local anaesthetic.</li>
                    <li>Punctum is dilated with the Nettleship's punctum dilator.</li>
                    <li>Lacrimal sac is syringed out 2-3 times using 24-26 gauge cannula attached to 5 cc syringe filled with normal saline and antibiotic drops are instilled.</li>
                </ol>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-442.jpg" alt="Syringing through lower punctum technique">
                    <figcaption>Syringing through lower punctum</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <ul>
                    <li>Syringing is repeated daily initially and later twice weekly.</li>
                    <li>After a few days the fluid may pass freely into the nasal duct.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. In recalcitrant cases</h4>
                <p>The following surgical procedures are advised:</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li><strong>Dacryocystectomy</strong> - The lacrimal sac is excised completely in elderly persons specially if the lacrimal sac is fibrosed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dacryocystorhinostomy</strong> - It is a nasal drainage operation performed in young and adult patients. It is the treatment of choice in most cases as it cures the persistent epiphora. The sac must be of normal size in order to anastomose it with the healthy nasal mucosa.</li>
                    <li>Insertion of special tubes, e.g. Lester-Jones tube, Pawar's cannula in the lacrimal sac facilitates the drainage of tears into the nasal cavity.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Dacryocystectomy (DC)</h4>
                <p>A complete excision of the lacrimal sac is performed in cases where the sac is severely fibrosed and cannot be anastomosed to nasal mucosa.</p>
